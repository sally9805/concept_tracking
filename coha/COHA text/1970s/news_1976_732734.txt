txt Letters to the Editor Letters to the Editor Why the Westway ' Must Be Scrapped ' Thoughts on China To the Editor : Westway must be scrapped so we can get on with sensible solutions to city transportation questions . Westway is unthinkable not only because it exacerbates severe environmental problems but because it threatens productive neighborhoods and the city economy . West Side " blight " and urban decay are weighted words that recur in proInterstate arguments , but the area in question enjoys : ( 1 ) Two of our healthiest business and residential communities , Grenwich Village and ChelseaClinton. ( 2 ) Two of the city 's major employers , the Gansevoort meat market and the printing industry . ( 3 ) A flourishing new community in Washington Market , including Independence Plaza . ( 4 ) Some of our newest piers , which Westway will destroy at a time when fuel shortages demand return to rail and water freight movement . To the extent any " blight " exists , Interstate promoters foster it by discouraging investors worried by a tento-fifteen-year Interstate construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We do not agree , however , that the area is blighted . These vigorous communities , which the Interstate would maim , if not destroy , may not be magazine-picture pretty but they work . Promised parks atop the landfill have to be planned and maintained by the city , which canOf Carter and God To the Editor : In his Oct. 3 letter Daniel J. Hornstein decried Jimmy Carter 's alleged " hot line to God " and likened the candidate to a bedeviled child or schized-out criminal defendant . Whether Mr. Carter 's references to divine guidance are literal or symbolic , who is qualified to challenge the sources of one 's inspiration when it is the inspired , and not the inspirer , who is asking for the job ? Do not one 's deeds express one 's inner motives and true character ? If Mr. Carter 's " hot line " were to a multinational corporation , the Pope , the Chiefs of Staff or the D.A.R. , would the tangibility of these sources be more acceptable to Mr. Kornstein 's concrete intellect ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of pantheistic teleology . But in a world in which the vast majority of humankind believes in some form of deity , I see neither shame nor weakness in ascribing one 's moral attitudes or acts of conscience to the will of a supernatural being . If Mr. Carter hears and heeds God 's word , then God bless him ! Better God than General Motors . ANDREW S. KENT Brooklyn , Oct. 4 , 1976 ? Presidential Contacts To the Editor : Your choice of words implies something sinister in President Ford 's " concentrated association with men who represented great financial power .. . " ( editorial Sept. 30 ) . Someone with a pro-business perspective might logically interpret such To the Editor : The Times should reconsider its attitude toward the Health and Hospitals Corporation . Contrary to your editorial of Oct. 5 , there is not an excess of beds in the Bronx . According to a survey made by the Health Systems Agency , the Bronx is not overbedded . Morrisania and Fordham have been closed , as have a number of proprietary hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities were closed , including 332 condemned beds in Montefiore , there would be a shortage rather than an excess of beds in the Bronx . North Central Bronx has not stood empty for three years , as your editorial indicates : It has been ready for occupancy for the past two months . It is one of the finest facilities in the country . To keep it closed would be an act of madness . The Health and Hospitals Corporation is not fiscally irresponsible . It has met its budget and erased its deficits . Its budget has been reduced in real dollars . Its billings and collections are on target .. The auditing firm of Arthur Andersen &; Co. sees continuing improvement in the corporation 's accounting practices . The corporation should not be blamed for fiscal crises not of its own doing . It is asked to make instantaneous adjustments to accommodate the latest budgetary demands for economy . In the last two years it has lost not maintain its present parks . And the above-ground Interstate service lanes will inhibit waterfront access . City economy : ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as expendable in exchange for a quick Federal handout . ( 2 ) The major employers near the highway will be hurt by construction disruption and real-estate speculation . ( 3 ) We have good buildings going to waste now ; landfill development will siphon money from rehabilitation and from existing vacant sites . ( 4 ) State cost for the Interstate , $110 million , is many times the cost of a more modest road . New York needs that money to restore budget cuts . ( 5 ) Traffic congestion costs New York business $1 billion a year . Congestion will be eased not by accommodating increased Interstate through-traffic but by implementing the Transportation Control Plan to reduce traffic . ( 6 ) Interstate Transfer allows New York to trade in the Interstate for mass-transit aid of between $500 million and $1 billion , an option that benefits all New Yorkers . According to a study in Science , there are 3.2 more jobs per dollar spent in mass transit than in highway building . And the work benefits us all . The city 's real economic interest lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N.Y . Branch/Friends of the Earth New York , Oct. 7 , 1976 contacts as wisely keeping in touch with people who control millions of jobs and are responsible for billions of doliars in capital investment ? which create still more jobs . It 's good to have a President who feels at ease with the productive sector of society . HOWARD CAINE New York , Oct. 2 , 1976 ? A Foreign-Policy Priority To the Editor : The second debate between Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford was held at the site of the signing of the Charter of the United Nations . Yet not one of the three reporters asked a single question about United States foreign policy in relation to the United Nations . No one asked President Ford to justify this country 's vote in the United Nations against forming a special committee to consider proposals to reform the United Nations . No one asked Jimmy Carter to explain what he meant by the term " world order politics " and its relationship to the United Nations . No one asked either candidate to explain how we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The United Nations has not lived up to its expectations . But this does not justify our reliance upon bilateral diplomacy or cold-war rhetoric . What this country needs is a foreign policy aimed at making the United Nations into a more responsible and more effective instrument for achieving world peace . Without such a policy , the world may be in serious trouble . WALTER HOFFMANN New Jersey State U.N . Day Chairman Wayne , NJ. , Oct. 7 , 1976 about 7,000 employees . Since 1972 it has reduced its bed complement by 3,000 . The ongoing fiscal crisis is now being aggravated by the demand that the corporation reduce its budget by $26 million not because of excess spending and fiscal irresponsibility but because of a most recent decision to cut the corporation 's Medicaid rate for inpatient beds from $216 to $197 . The pursuit of the corporation is not over : It is now being threatened by a reduction in its rates for longterm care . If these rates go into effect , there may be another shortfall and perhaps another editorial . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the corporation . Perhaps The Times likes to see the end of the Health and Hospitals Corporation . This would be wrong . If the corporation went out of existence , it would have to be invented over again . It is the only system which takes care of the working poor , which admits all patients irrespective of their ability to pay for health care , the only truly public agency , despite rhetoric to the contrary , which is accountable to city and state control , the only one with genuine community participation . The corporation could serve as a model for health care . The potential is there . Why not develop it ? MILTON F. KIRCHMAN Member of the Board N.Y.C. Health And Hospitals Corp . New York , Oct. 5 , 1976 To the Editor : After the death and transfiguration of Mao Tse-tung Han Suyin , Op-Ed Sept. 25 , whither China ? Much depends on one 's perspective . Most observers begin with 1949 as the Year One of the " new " China . Others , like the writer , see instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a continuous history beginning in the second millenium B.C.E. The Chinese paper cut ( anonymous ) recent photograph of the members ( it the Politburo bowing in unison three times before the bier of Mao dramatically illuminates the issue of continuity versus discontinuity . I shall take as'my text Gen.27:22 : " The voice is the voice of Jacob read Mao but the hands are the hands of Esau Chou En-lai . " Post-revolutionary China has constantly been engaged in a see-saw struggle between two tendencies : the extremist line of continuous revolution , giVing primacy to politics over economics , and the moderate pragmatic line , which would give first place to economic development . The latest expression of the first tendency , the Cultural Revolution led by Mao , was laid to rest by the Tenth Party Congress and ensuing Peoples ' Con-gress under the guidance of Chou , , who directed the nation 's goals to the achievement of a modern industrial state by the end of the century . The unexpected dismissal of Teng Hsiao-ping , Chou 's anointed successor , was the last convulsion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the radicals will be forced to retreat , and the moderates , supported by the army , will consolidate their power under the temporary leadership of Hua Kuo-feng . This transition is likely to proceed with diminishing turbulence . Mao has achieved godhead but Chou 's disciples will become the church fathers . While the ideological contest with Russia may as a result be mitigated , the two countries remain locked by history and geography in an ineluctible continuing struggle over their vast borderlands . How does this affect American policy ? We should remain neutral in their quarrel but ponder , like the Irishman of the story " Who should we be neutral ag'inst ? " Since expansionist Russia is the global threat today , while China will be hors de combat for a decade or more , wisdom dictates that we " tilt " toward China to maintain the Eurasian balance for the foreseeable future . ELIAS M. SCHWARZBART New York , Sept. 30 , 1976 ? To the Editor : Your Oct. 1 editorial " China PostMao " equates the death of Mao with that of Stalin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you suggest that Mao might well suffer a demolition in his reputation similar to the one endured by Stalin some three years after his death . A more appropriate analogy would he to compare the demise of Mao with Lenin 's passing . Both men were the founders and architects of their respective Communist states . To attack Lenin after his death would have been to attack the very essence of the party and the nation . And so it is with Mao . Although he had his enemies , now that he is gone it will be in the interests of all who follow him to preserve the Mao cult . To do otherwise would be to undermine the ideological and political foundations on which they themselves must stand . ( Asst . Prof. ) BARBARA KELLERMAN Political Science . Tufts University Medford , Mass. , Oct. 1 . 1976 An editorial on this subject appears today . ? On Raising Federal Pay , To the Editor : There apparently has developed a widespread misunderstanding of thy : nature of the increase in pay of executive , legislative and judicial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least one letter to you . The increase authorized under legislation passed in 1975 and recently deleted from an appropriation bill would not have been a cost-of-living adjustment . Rather , it would have matched the increase in pay to be put into effect for other Federal whitecollar employees , which , in turn , is based on pay in the private sector . These increases may be smaller or larger than the increase in the Consumer Price Index , but they are designed simply to maintain comparability in pay , There is no provision for automatic increases in Federal employees ' pay with changes in the C.P , 1 . similar to the automatic changes in effect for some employees in private industry and for some retired workers. ?
