By now , it is scarcely news that the economy is climbing out of recession ; but last week brought fresh evidence that the recovery , at least for the moment , is proceeding faster than expected and some of the darkest clouds hanging over it are dispersing.The signs : <P> &gt; The Federal Reserve Board cut bank reserve requirements , in effect allowing banks to increase their loans to consumers and businessmen by about $2 billion . The action will help calm money markets that had been nervous about the W.T. Grant Co. bankruptcy and the continuing financial woes of New York City . It is also an unmistakable sign that the board is easing its recent tightfisted monetary policy , and will let the nation 's money supply grow enough at least to hit its own announced target of 5% to 7 a year . That , in turn , should ease fears that high interest rates will choke off the recovery : last week Southwest Bank of St. Louis cut its prime rate on business loans from 8% to 7% . <P> &gt; Industrial production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1967 average . That is the largest gain for any month in almost eleven years . Steel , chemicals and other heavy industries led the advance , rising more than 3% ; output of consumer goods gained a more modest 0.9% . <P> &gt; Trade and manufacturing inventories increased $1.3 billion in August , after a drop of nearly $8 billion between January and July . While some further depletion in total business stocks is still possible this fall , the August figures indicate that businessmen have worked off most of the enormous stocks of unsold goods that had been dragging down production in late 1974 and early 1975 , and they are now swinging from inventory cutting to inventory rebuilding . <P> &gt; Total sales of all businesses climbed 1.7% from July to August : 0.3% for retailers , 1.3% for wholesalers , 2.7% for manufacturers . The August gain totaled $2.9 billion , or more than twice as much as inventories increased . That means the ratio of inventories to sales declined . To keep this key ratio from dropping too far , businessmen may have to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new orders should give a further boost to production . <P> &gt; Sales of new cars jumped 12.7% above a year ago during the first ten days of October , only the second time this year that auto sales have run ahead of 1974 . American Motors reported a 25.3% increase , General Motors 16.7% , Ford 15.7% ; only Chrysler showed a decline ( of 14% ) . More significant , the period was the first during which nearly all 1976 car models were available to buyers ; the sales gain indicated that price increases averaging roughly $200 on ' 76 cars are not turning off would-be buyers to anything like the extent that price boosts of about $450 on the ' 75s did twelve months ago . Last fall slumping sales at the start of the 1975-model run gave an early signal that what had been a mild recession was turning into a nosedive ; this year climbing sales at the start of the new auto model-year could be a sign that recovery is gaining more strength than was foreseen .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
