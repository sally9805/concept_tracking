 | Feeling One 's Way Across the Chasm What we were kneeing and elbowing our way through , vertically , single file , was a little knottier than a laurel thicket , a little more open than what is called a laurel hell . Piedmont in July . " Mr. Service ? " What . " Maybe 1 ' 11 go into the woods again sometime . But I ai n't ever going with you . Not ever . " Back in June I had said , " Tony , ecology ca n't be taught to kids 6 to 11 in only two weeks , not even an introduction . It 's a purely derivative science . One must presuppose a certain background in biology , chemistry , physics and mathematics . " ( Like contributors to the Congressional Record , I tend to edit some of my talk . ) Tony Mulvihill had dropped by with a middling-size bag of 63  | federal grant money and a sheaf of engaging ideas , some of which had considerable fuzz on them . The squad that I was leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , as usual , most of them black ? and two junior counselors , Robin and Leonard . I was not lecturing anybody on how rapidly we were traversing from typical flood-plain flora of sycamore and gum through Appalachian heath to open , near-climax , mixed mesophytic forest . The children were sniping and bitching at me and at each other . " Quit droppin dirt on me . " " Can we go back now ? " " We have to do this ? " " I 'm tired . " " Move , girl . " " Leggo me , I ai n't pullin you up this hill . " " Prickabriars . I 'm stuck . " " Mr. Service . . . you sweatin . " " Take us back . " On such days I was often to act , or fail to act , out of anger or boredom or confusion or frustration or simple malaise . I was now about to act , for what I hope was the only time , out of spite . We had followed the irregular arc of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were about to cut straight across the arc through easy open woods back to the lodge . " You tired ? " I asked . Uh huh . " Want to go back now ? " Uh huh . But also some stalwart noes . " All those . . . all those who want to go back the way we came can go back with Leonard . All those who want to go on ahead with me straight back to camp , and 1 vow straight back to camp , come over here with me . " They unhesitatingly split six and six , with all but one of the little girls electing to turn back ? the round-faced girls , their features already setting into placid , no-nonsense domesticity . Little black kids have a way of saying " Bye " that suggests they are moving toward life 's very good things while those told " Bye " are into a very bad thing ; the least it can mean is that you had better reconsider your position . A lot of those special " Byes " were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squad plunged down into the laurel jungle we had just won through . Back in camp , I told them to save seven cold juices for Leonard and his group , they would be very tired . I was feeling much better . " If you ca n't teach them ecology , " Mulvihill had said with a shrug , " teach them what you can . " It was to be a program of four twoweek sessions , each with 100 kids , black and white . The " day " began with a halfmile jog from the buses to a light but nourishing breakfast at the camp . Then one group might be led off ( no , no , not led ? invited ) to perform free expressive body movements to music ; another would be crossing a chasm on a singlerope traverse or tracing the nutritional path of a hickory nut through the flesh of a squirrel and the guts of a hawk and back to the forest floor ; another would be doing isometrics or noncompetitive group strenuosities ; another sculpting free forms from fresh-dug , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from berries , roots and toadstools , or playing slow-motion tag . Movement , muscle , freedom , music , the cycle of life , confidence , joy , color , texture , endurance , love , respect , identity . All that . This wildly idealized version of our day existed only in bits and pieces . All too often the children ended up with pot holders , Kool-Aid , kickball , Twinkle , Twinkle , Little Star , aimless hikes along a worn path . Do It Bite ? Do It Sting ? Millipedes are obscure , humble folk . I know little about them beyond their vegetarian or scavenging diet , their harmlessness and their stately way of pro- 64 @# gressing on the sea waves of their own legs . I should have known this one was n't a millipede . It was living under one of the 40,000 rocks we turned over in those two months . The way it moved : sinuous , fast , questing . I tricked it up into my hands where it raced and twined among the fingers . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children ? whether they are awed , repelled , or utterly indifferent ? you permit yourself no qualm " Do it bite ? Do it sting ? " 1 said blandly , " I do n't know . Do . . . does it ? " Uh huh . Oh yes . " If it bite , bites , how come it is n't biting me ? " ( Subtly steering the course of discussion . you see . ) The answer was right there : " Cause you white . " They took it from me on faith that this was a kind of millipede . " Who 'll take him back to camp ? " The little girl 's name was Gail . She was afraid of the thing . Why she felt it necessary to fight that fear , I do n't know . Dark hand . coral palm : back and forth . touch no touch . Finally she held still , I poured the crawler down into her hand . Shriek . She jumped back , shaking her hand . Then tears and weeping . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Little lady . he could n't possibly have stung you . He 's got hard prickly little legs , and when he crawled on your fingers you thought he was biting you . " Not reassured . she more or less acquiesced to the phrases . I wrapped thething in a handkerchief and took it back to the lodge . Before caging it , I took a closer look : it was a centipede , a predator and mildly venomous ? mildly being the word when you 're not being bitten by one . Gail accepted my apologies , even my instruction on some differences between millipedes and centipedes , with great good grace . Yes , Gail , it bites . and when it bites , it stings . Sightseeing ? Well , Maybe Many had never swung a bat , gone into the woods , immersed themselves in a body of water ? not even in a tub ? swung on a rope , touched modeling clay , touched any musical instrument , touched paints or dyes , touched any living animal , and by animal I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor had some of e black kids ever touched a white perIn . ( Sally , how come your hair do n't get nappy when it wet ? Mr. Service .. . you hairy . Where 'd you get all that hair ? hat do you mean where 'd 1 get it , I ew it . ) But there were other children m surroundings some few cuts above y poverty level . Somehow a good number - of brights had infiltrated the rolls . . as a squad on its first day turns to the woods , a boy near the head of line might be showing what he knows photosynthesis while a tiny girl like erri , a moth-child , dressed poor ? phographers take her picture when they need to make their point ? is tearfully going to pieces because her mama warned her and warned her never to go to the woods . . . . toadstools , a kaleidoscope of them , and always a group would identify them as Devil 's Food . On showing - em a half-eaten toadstool : " The devil eat that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question would sift out a number of skeptics but leave a hard core of old believers . ... a buzzard of ill-omen was skating fairly low over the ball field , the sun just right to cast its shadow sharp down on us . " Take care , " 1 suggested as we crossed the field , " that shadow fall on you and you fall dead in the morning . " ( Did you hear what he say ? Did he mean it ? He 's foolin us again . Maybe . ) Mr. Service . . . is that the truth ? 1 gave the question some thought . " Probably not . " ... the largest creature seen . We were going through a thicket near the lake and I started up a blue heron , which lifted off and headed down the lake . I saw it , the counselor saw it ; the one child who saw it stopped watching before it was gone and did not ask what it was . Rape I bring out 40 feet of good one-inch hemp . " What you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile , I weave an enormous hangman 's noose . They like that . 1 suggest we swing on a rope swing . First we need a strong branch high enough . There is only one in the area . Stuck beforehand on a sapling nearby is a ball of twine . " How we gon get the rope up there ? " I do n't know for sure . Work it out . " You tell us . " No. @# @# Their only real problem is the height of the branch ? almost beyond the maximum effective range of a 9-year-old arm . Some groups begin to size up the situation efficiently . Other groups snarl into such hopeless complications of bickering and misconception that I begin to mistrust my own solution , and suddenly for the first time I see and hear the contractors on site at the Tower of Babel . The thick straight bole is unclimbable . They have to try . Two groups , independently , worked out the plan of hoisting the lightest , then hoisting the hoister , and so on until presumably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunk to the branch . . . . The lightest clung like a limpet , way up , having ooched up from the hoister 's shoulders until he could set his feet on the upraised hands . And , suddenly realizing how high he was , yelled out , " 1 comin down , " and did . Whether or not the problem will be solved depends not only on somebody 's coming up with the big idea , but on getting the solution through to the action gang . Several times the solution languished on the sidelines inside the head of a kid nobody would listen to . And one , Sagacious Queenie , did n't much care whether anybody got to swing or not and anyhow was n't about to help the boys . She took the solution away with her in a clique of bored girls . Obviously , the answer was to tie the twine to a rock , throw rock over branch , tie twine to rope , pull rope over branch , secure end of rope . Or is it so obvious ? On a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a university administrator and experienced mountaineer , a parapsychologist and a psychiatrist ? work on this same problem in order to lift our sack of grub up and away from bears . Before their inelegant success , they stood around and discussed the problem for hours . Which is exactly what Christopher had his people do . And then comes the breath-holding moment , that first inevitable turn of twine around the rope , which , though better postponed until the rock is up and over , still signals the real engineering breakthrough . However , Christopher tied the rock on the end of just 10 feet of twine . His idea , his winged vision , was that the heaved rock would draw behind it 20 feet of hawser that would arc through the sky over the branch and back down to the waiting kids . I was always very tough about intervention . Staff , junior counselors , visitors , passing loudmouths who might have been with a successful group the day before ? all shut up , no help , no advice . But I had to intervene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw , everyone clear out of the way . " Christopher threw , rock flew to end of tether and whipped back like a bolo . The end of the rope had just about twitched . Repeat . He turned a threequarter face and full sideways glance my way . . . to meet a gaze as blank and pitiless as the sun . He took a second length of twine , same length as the first , a second rock , harnessed rock to rope . A tandem rig ! A peer was enlisted to help power it . Together they let fly , but not in unison . A third was told to call signals . They threw . The end of the rope jumped , sort of . Michael , a superb follower , an enthusiastic goer-through-the-motions , was drafted to power-boost the rope itself . He grabbed the end , at the signal wafted it two-handed up and jumped for the excitement of it . A great grin and a funny Iook : he had not been suffering under the faintest hope that the thing would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been arrived at but was foundering in an exasperation of misjudged lengths , snagged twine , bad knots and dangling rocks , it was Michael who delivered a technical breakthrough : hold one end , throw the whole ball of twine over the branch . He brought the idea to me . " So do it . " But Christopher was still driving the action gang through one of his own splendid moon shots . Michael never got the whole ball , which he needed . Christopher failed to realize he was facing the crisis question in every great project : Are things going wrong because the idea itself is flawed , or because we are not putting enough into it ? Not enough must have been his judgment , because he then set on a course that would have ended up with a dozen small black arms cocked back in unison to catapult a dozen rocks in harness to the rope . Like diagrams of early flying machines , the thing had a flawed beauty to it unlike so much of our modern technology gone wrong : the F-ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tank . ( Here , the reader with some Newtonian physics might want to figure out whether Christopher 's solution was impossible or merely impractical . You may have inelastic twine of infinite strength and as many 9-year-old kids as necessary . ) But again the adult world had to intervene . With a dozen rocks lashing back every which way , one of them would be bound to hit someone . Sometimes coaxing , sometimes demanding , a boy named Thomas worked me for how the other groups had done it . I reeled it all off : they called a helicopter , or bent the tree over , or used a trained eagle , or made a human ladder , or pole-vaulted . He stamped his foot at each fable and finally said it could n't be done . Some groups gave up quickly , going listlessly off . Others would stick with it all day . One group lacked a boy agile enough to make it to the first branch of the dogwood ? useless anyway ? and so rock by rock two kids began to build a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Hurdle , who helped administer the camp , that it was like witnessing the dawn of technology . Hurdle replied , " You just like to rest after lunch . " But most of the young counselors were getting caught up in their groups ' success or failure , and anyhow they were glad not to have to go floundering through two miles of prickabriar for a change . Rope II So what else can children do with a 40-foot hawser ? We stretch it between two trees , as high as we can reach , and Mulvihill demonstrates something called the Tyrolean Traverse . You dangle your body from the rope by hands and feet , make a few adjustments of the self and then simply hitch along in pain . Children with less body pressure per square inch enjoy it , though not many succeed in going the whole distance . I picked two who had made it . Below the rope , I informed them , lay a 1,000-foot chasm with hungry crocodiles at the bottom . Start toward each other from opposite ends and may the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Carlton is wiry and very agile but Gregory is strong and very agile and twice as big . They are just about to start when I hear a small voice . Wait a minute , wait a minute , here 's the new situation : this ground here is a swamp , you see , and it 's crawling with poison snakes , and if any part of either of you touches the swamp the snakes can shoot right up and bite , so somehow you 're going to have to get by each other . Meeting at sag point , they hung on , exchanged monosyllabic instructions and then handholds . They strained and grabbed . One time Gregory 's swinging foot kicked dust from the swamp but too quick apparently for the snakes . Gregory and Carlton passed each other . I have no idea how they managed , but they did do it and triumphantly touched their opposite trees . They had been getting yells and encouragement all the way , good noises . Johnny Barbee One day I had a heckler . The boy kept interrupting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blanks . How come you know all this stuff ? " I switched groups . I heard it all yesterday . " He enjoyed his own joke . He would n't shut up . As jovially as I could , I pushed him backward off the log . Feet propped up , he lay back and laughed . I tried to intimidate him with what used to intimidate me in Army days ? the slow , cold question , What 's your name , soldier ? It did n't work on Johnny Barbee . Good-naturedly aggressive , Barbee had a lot of top-dog qualities ? he was smart , strong , coordinated ? which failed to get him the role because he rarely meshed with anyone in his group . He seemed too old for his age , things in him were being rushed to completion , or closure , for some forced deadline . He grabbed attention , he talked too much , he disrupted . Still , we got on well enough in the days that followed . Time then for ( Counselor ) Sprague 's Choral and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground , an infestation of the six or seven rowdiest around me . I had good enough rapport with some of them , but there was no psychology involved . When a small black face is confronted by a large white face that reddens , sweats , bulges veins and arteries at the temples and hisses through gritted teeth , " I want to hear the music , " the kids will want to hear the music . Bar-68 @# bee 's group went up to perform . I stayed on the ground among the rowdies . How come ? He shook his ha shrugged . Barbee , if I ask you a t.0 tion , will you give me the right answer " Yeah . " If you wo n't tell me the tru I wo n't tell you what the question " Yeah , O.K. " ( Children are gull they go for sucker bait endlessly . ) Pr ( ise . " Yeah , promise . " You scared to up there in front of everybody ? He i a stick through the dust . " Naww @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " Yeah . " What could I say ? 1 wt the edge of the same phobia . Matching Leaves Unless asked , I never told them the na of anything . As a rule , anyway . So times out of laziness or habit I wou identify something . We move into the woods and as 1 I pluck one of this and one of that : hit . ory , oaks , pipsissewa , wild ginger , et until it comes to one per child . The ject is to bring me back one of the sa kind ; the goal is simply stop and k close . The first time out , I was relucta to try such a sissy game on the they might turn on me . So while t were down in the creek doing the rig things like rounding up crayfish ar throwing stones into the water , I gat ered the girls , handed each a leaf twig and told them to go find me one like it . The troops , realizing that something ? maybe better than what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clambered out of the creek and demarded in on it . On that and 100 subsequent occasions , there was a wide range of results : one child coming back in 20 seconds saying that was too easy , give me another ; one scouting grimly foot by foot , refusing to give up , passing by 20 of what he was looking for ; another . peevish and unwilling to move more than a few feet out into the forest away from the protection of Daniel Boone ( me ) and the counselors , whines that there is n't any around . ( If it is a high , clear kind of day , I yield to what usually is a little girl , saying , " Yes , I know it was the very last leaf of its sort left in the forest . " ) But that first time out was one of the good moments , like when the motorcycle gang decides to help plant seedlings in the park . The leaf matching is a kind of per-  | ceptual skill , subject to the usual distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Johnny Barbee . I gave him a sprig of something-or-other , he circled off and was back in front of me in no time with the match . Repeat . And repeat . Then the fink , the inevitable mark , the agent without whom the wheels of the machine would grind , well , very differently : " He tearin them in half an showin you both pieces . " Barbee showed only radiant glee . That trickster could n't have kept his little triumph to himself more than another minute or so anyhow . As for another few children , there were some who would take from me , say , the unique five-part leaf of a Virginia creeper , or the simple Valentine heart of the redbud tree , and return with a leaf of anything , absolutely anything . Not half trying , I thought , just going through the motions in order to get by . Six or seven of these kids in all went by me before I realized that 1 was being shown a basic and puzzling deficit in seeing . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , and I wonder how they are doing . A good leaf is wild ginger . A child matches it with another ; I tell her to tear and smell them . With only a little grabbing , the bruised leaves are passed around . The children make their associations gravely : liniment , root beer , Necco wafers , cough syrup , soap . A few then scout for more , which they gather into great ugly fragrant bouquets . No One Could Hold A Candle . . Maynard announced his birthday was coming up . That was great , congratulations . " Will you give me a present ? " Not a chance , Maynard , this is a tough place , nobody in the history of this camp has ever been given a birthday present , and you 're not going to be the first . " Will I get a birthday cake ? " There 's not a soul here can or will bake . We do n't have the stuff and , even if we did , this is n't the kind of place where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , " Will you give me a hug ? " 1 gave him his hug , set him down and told him what 's more his group would sing him Happy Birthday when the time came . They did so , a version new to me in which the celebrant has a stanza to sing solo ? " Today I am eight , today I am eight , something something etc . " They then gave him a thumping , not gently but not too rough . Months later , my own children ran across Maynard in a public park . He was still working strangers for little remembrances on one of the many auxiliary birthdays he has strung through the year . A Law Of Nature All But Repealed Spiders eat flies . Questioned about what spiders eat , too many children had given me answers like fruit ? nuts ? grass ? In the school cafeteria where we went for lunch , 1 snatched at flies until I had half a dozen imprisoned in an empty milk carton . If one can not withstand dubious expressions on watchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of a cold audience . Exploring the woods , we got used to spider webs by the faceful , or most of us did . A pretty child , a self-possessed and pampered priss , let the rest of her group know , " I always walk right behind Mr. Service . " She set me up well enough , waiting a few beats . " He clears off the spider webs . " But when you want a spider web , you never can find one . Eventually , however , fly carton in hand , I found a web just above eye level . All right , people , gather round . I threw one of the flies in . The spider , the common woods kind with the odd spiky abdomen , ran smoothly up the web to safety : the movement of my hand , the puff of air , something . I resisted the urge to smash it . Well , it was n't the only spider in the woods . The next , one of a sort that weaves a horizontal net and races @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trap , would not emerge . The spider was there all right , lurking at the end of its silk tube , but it just would n't come out . A bad choice . Habitually paranoid , the type retreats at the least disturbance , and my 10 crowding , blundering ox-foots were too much of a disturbance . Other webs . The micronightmare began . The fly , thrown several times , would pass back and forth through the web unsnagged until lost or trampled by an ox-foot . Interest and , more important , faith were dissipating rapidly . I was down to my last fly , which I dropped into a small delicate web shaped like an upside-down parachute ; its sophisticated artificer was also small 70 r and delicate , an iridescent greenish I thank and praise it for going ri work , subtly and lethally . I gave a ping commentary : the loop arou leg , more lines around the whole back under the web to put the into a leg yet keep protected in ca insect was a kind that could bite then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly 's insides out . itated , and it became a pause for . .. the way you suck milk thro straw out of a carton . Some of the g of course , had immediately gone off interested . The rest watched exactly way fascinated children are suppo watch , and because this loss and of life was going on a foot or so a their heads , their mouths were sli open as they looked upward . Soon . questions and comments and a few con nations of the mean old spider ( im itly , condemnations of me ) . Well sir . all want meat , and that 's the spi meat , only he 's got no choice , that 's only kind of thing he can eat . I walked out of the woods that only slightly shaken . But for that si fly and last spider , I would have wal out a broken man . I go on to I which spiders will perform in front jostling public and rely on them to k order in nature . Volunteers We call for volunteers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up tr or maybe to a good job like damming the creek for a dunking pool . There just no telling . Twenty crowd up to what we have only equipment or sp for 15 to do . O.K. , troops , I 'm look for five volunteers . . . there we ... you , you , you , you and you ? , That 's right , go . Do something else . ter luck next time , there are lots days left . They discover that while t system can be outguessed , the odds difficult . Why I Like The Orangemen We thought we were dividing our ti invasion into six color groups at ra dom , but the devil surely nudged tin we called Orange together into one . T children who heckle my lectures , tear up my books and notes , tromp my spectacles , steal the turtles , bombard birds " ' nests ( I have to stage indignation at this :  | nests were , of course , empty by then ) , make up clubs to hammer trees with d also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salamanders in with snakes ? those were the ones I nd best to deal with . Provided , alys provided , they came in small ugh numbers to be met face to e . Bill Hurdle gave me insight into rt of the reason for my choice : " Fifteenn minutes walk into those woods and y 're all yours . They 're afraid they 'll never get back . " So its Day One . I give some variation of my lecture on the possibility of ers and alligators and on the reality copperheads and keep within sight f each other , etc. etc . I ask for a leadto take us anywhere he wants right to the woods , but stay off the trails nd paths . At the word " leader , " Emet springs up and puts his fist up by y face . No , the hand is open . Volunteering to lead differs considerably from leading . Emmet , as leader , planes uncertainly along the margin of the woods . " Is this the way ? " Your choice , Emmet , anyu here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from me to the darkgreen interior of the trackless jungle and to some of his followers , who , comfortless , begin to goad him . He conies to a place in the road where a narrow extension of timber separates us from a playing field . He plunges us deep into forest and 30 steps later out the other side and triumphantly into : he blazing sun . We thank Emmet , give another kid his turn . This one plows right on in and , elbows out , takes great , high trample-down strides to assert his rank . He will clear the @# @# way . But when any kind of footpath is detected , our fearless leader swerves toward it with the greatest relief , even though he has no idea where it may go . We head decisively away and into the wilderness . The woods are a maze : stretches of maturing hardwoods , odd patches of starved-out fields now scrambled with briar , honeysuckle , poverty pine , hellfetter : cool groves of pine , holly , cedar , all carpeted with ground cedar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , you ca n't see very far in any direction except up , and the admonition to keep in sight is , the first few times out , unnecessary . The group that minutes before was fanning out all over the playground proceeds now as a moving huddle or strings out in lockstep . They trample on each other 's heels and on mine . Look around , men , there 's really enough woods here for everybody . Spread out . They go on chewing each other out for tripping . We stop for a breather . O.K. , tell me , which way back-to the lodge ? Arms signpost every which way except straight up and straight down . They are anxious to know which is the right way . Maybe here a feather touch of sadism : I do n't know for sure which way , are we lost ? It 's like the roller coaster or the horror movie . You know you 're safe , but . The children appeal to the counselors , who return elaborate shrugs . Ifs not a good idea to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if at this point I give a little talk on how not to get lost in the wilderness , I am talking to an attentive group . To that extent , then , Hurdle was right : the change in the Orangemen from rabble to Sunday school class is very soothing . More important was seeing it enacted , but the restless troublemaker was very often the kid most eager to go out and search for things . Wasps When very young , I was persuaded by a friend a few years older to " feed the bees . " He would cut open an apple from the old tree in his backyard , sit down and offer the hand-held apple to any passing bee or wasp . They came to sup in numbers and in kinds . He would let the juice run over his hand and deliberately spread some around on his arm so that they would take it right from his skin . That was how he did it , and so did 1 . Stepwise , in fear and doubt and resentment , so did I. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wasps . We drew the line at real hornets , as a matter of policy , but we courted those striped harlequins . They were ideal for this early test of machismo . There was one more test . We did it with bees and yellow jackets ( the torero gets to select his own bull , remember ) but I do n't think with anything else . While the insect is feeding , one nudges it with a forefinger , delicately . But the point is to carry i , t off with nonchalance , as if one could shove a bee , elbow it to one side , with impunity . One morning about 25 years later a scream of little girls pulled me from sleep right up out of bed . Four children , among them my daughter , had been hit by a squadron of yellow jackets . When the cries had choked down to sobs and snuffles , I began to lay down the unguent doctrine that if you do n't bother them they wo n't bother you ? in fact , if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grape and split it . These folk nest in the earth . 1 found the entrance , approached it . The little girls huddled a safe distance away , all smeary-faced and welted . I held the grape to the opening . The first wasp out landed on the grape , walked directly across and over my thumbnail to the root and , as soon as it found itself on flesh , utterly without gesture or vehemence ( not waspish , not mad  | as a hornet ) , it sank its stinger through the fine papery skin behind the nail . I shook away grape and wasp and sauntered back with set jaw to the little ladies . " Remember where the nest is , " I said , " and go around it . " Now , a few years later , I sat by the iced juice vat at the day camp and ruminated . People had been getting stung . Great tears had run down the face of Jo Sally , and everyone wanted to comfort her . Ronald , stung once on a hike , vowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days before I had trudged back up the dusty road in the company of teary children and remarked to Hurdle , " If I were a platoon leader I 'd be courtmartialed . " Why ? " We came under fire and I lost control of my group , also I do n't know where some of them are . " They came back . Which was no surprise . What had happened , I 'd taken the troops , with the three " missing " men foraging on ahead in the creek bed , right into an ambush . Taking a page from General Giap , the wasps let me and a few others pass , then opened up . Scream , jump , flap , flail , scatter , panic . The young lady who shrieked the loudest and thrashed the most desperately while crying for help came through untouched , of course . . . made me want to go back and sic one on her . So there I was counting the casualties while sitting at the picnic table . The bees and wasps were thronging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searched out the laboratory-flavored mechanical fruit juice we often served . I showed to myself and anybody who would watch how you could let them land on you , even push one ( just do n't lean on him ) , or gesture dismissively at one flying around . Many of the counselors would squeal and swing at them ? bad practice , a sure way to get stung , I kept saying ? but in all the days around the juice vat , with children and bees and wasps lined up together , there was only a single sting , and in that case the insect had definitely been leaned on . The idea of what was happening came with no great flash of light . Obviously , the wasps are triggered to sting anything that causes commotion close to the nest . What had been happening was the kids at the head of the column were alerting the nest and , by the time the wasps had scrambled up and out , it was the kids in the middle of the column who got hit . The squealing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . Some kids will run ahead , others retreat . It 's a massacre . I ruled out massive retaliation as contrary to the spirit of things but developed some sound defensive doctrine that I delivered to the counselors : at the first sting , yell out and everybody turn sharp left or sharp right and scatter . Disperse . In subsequent engagements , whether or not the casualty figures went down , I ca n't say . Come to think of it , it was n't any great crisis to begin with . Waterfall The big rain ... water sweeping beer cans , boxes , bottles across roads , the cars blinded , all colors grayed out by the curtains of water except for the bright orange that the gullies spewed into new lakes . Ninety kids crowded into the lodge , everything steamy wet , the electricity out and no water unless you wanted to face skyward and drown in it . If ever they were going to turn on us , then was their chance . Songs and dances and skits and any minute they were going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no sense or order in it . " Why do n't you take them down and show them what a waterfall really looks like , " Mulvihill suggested . It seemed one dubious idea . We called for men of unquestionable courage to face rain , cold , flood , wind , almost certain death . And stripped to shorts , we splashed off down the path . The rain through the trees was cold ; they knotted their bodies tight against it . You cold ? Naw ! Yeah , I cold . Scared ? No . Near the falls , they stopped in some consternation . What 's makin that noise ? Jet plane . Naw . Trucks ? The wind in the trees ? Uh uh . One kid shouted the truth : " It 's the waterfall . " Slow down , gentlemen . I meant to lead the column but a few piled on past me , for which I 'm glad , because I got to see them react . I seem to remember each child doing the same thing , although in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and what I did myself was similar , because the torrent of water was a lot more than I had expected . Each child half bent his body , clenched fists , flexed @# flexed arms at sides , and , wide-eyed , wide mouthed , jittered and yelled into the face of the cataract , Eee-yah ! Coemterphobia I remember no storm within the past two or three years that could have broken so thick and sound a hickory tree but there it was . An oak had caught it by the crown before it could lay it out . You could walk up this straightened rainbow , or crawl , or worm , until you were higher off the ground than most people like to be with nothing to h on to . At nine feet high a young ma crossed within easy reach . On discov ering the fallen tree , in a daze of co age , I simply walked up as far as maple , seized hold of its limbless tru and shinnied to the ground . Most my squad that day followed , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , confidence and coordination keeping them as secure on that round a railingless bole as on stairs . Others fro had to be coaxed and herded and tou talked . Some did not want to try . M self , at that age , I was not the kind child to go capering no-hands up a thing . Consequently , today everyone w going to try it . Just take a few step then jump off . . . a few steps and I lift you down just as soon as you scared . And so every last one made it . Falling is the purest of fears , and one was or another each small face reflected t fact ? some , by its mirror image , arro gance and show-off . The good momen the big moment , comes when the frigh ened child lurches from the high trun to cling to the fire-pole maple and in grip of hands and legs is able for a fe seconds to hang up there before sliding down . One sees on the face any mixtu of pride , relief , glee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M of them go around until told to quit , it 's time to head on in . Another group , and another . ( Not the next two , however ? those two expeditions out , I failed to find the tree . ) Deryl is heavy , slow-moving and has too little muscle for the load . He took . few steps up and wanted to quit . AI : fours then . O.K. A few more feet up Ca n't . Yes . Ca n't . Hug it and squint : ' your way up . O.K. . . no . . . I going back down . No . You 're there , you 've : plorer had to do was to head south to save himself and the little folk . Therefore , in that sense , 1 was never lost . But , well , let me put it this way : If one is not where one thinks one is , or is misled as to the time required to circle back to a designated spot , then I suppose , in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disoriented . I was often disoriented . Counselor Sprague , now , he got lost , although he might want to quibble with the word . Having set aside their chimes and tambours , he and his crew impulsively headed off somewhere and ended up in a patchwork wasteland of old fields . briar patch , uneasy in his subsequent journey , glad to get back and gutsy enough to tell about it . On such occasions when one becomes disoriented , there 's a certain amount of , well , face to be maintained . I do n't care if you call it front . The children ought to be on the buses by now . Behind you , the line straggles like a drugged brown centipede that has lost the famous centipede coordination . Ahead , the blank green wall . " Is we lost ? " the wrong kid asks . You are not lost , you just do n't know where the hell you are , nor does it much matter because at this rate , this slow crawl , it 's going to take until sunIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those washed-out , wrung-out soils ? stands of splintery pines crowded like toothpicks , rolling waves of honeysuckle , prickabriars in abundance . The children do not like the prickabriars . Partly as warning , partly as malediction , they yell " prickabraa " at the sight or touch of any of the four plants that bear the name . A few in Sprague 's group were becoming peevish even before it was time to return . He then made what turned out to be an error in judgment and a failure in image maintenance . He let it be known that they were going back to the lodge . When , 10 minutes later , they ended up in what was clearly the same field of prickabriars , the mood shaded toward the mutinous . Now whether in the 10 bad minutes between visit and revisit to the briar patch Sprague was lost or disoriented is mere definition . It was definite , though , that he was woeful at the second sight of the down , by which time you are going to be sweating and in administrative troubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong kid who asked , " Yes we 're lost . You 'd better start yelling for help . " They yell . With sincerity and despair , they yell . Some of the little ones must have lost their faith . It is a harder job to get them to shut up than you expect or want . But then , finally , cracks in the green wall and splinters of light up ahead and off to one side . Subtly , you shave a few degrees off your original bearing and line in on the light . You step out briskly into the sun and home . The children shout relief and joy . You 're not where you thought you 'd be , it 's a picnic area and not anywhere in sight of the ball field , but it 's home . Probably not , but possibly some kid will ask if next time he can be the leader , and you have to be careful not to misconstrue what he has said .  | get it made , keep coming . The fine , expressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The other kids coaxed , or goad-I impatiently . Then Barry , also overweight but who had made it one time , ho had been sitting off to one side ad shaping up what he had to say as if packing an ice ball , let it fly : " You so scared you would n't fight even if you and somebody was messin with your girl . " Now the situation had been cranked up one notch . Deryl was going to have to make it . He nodded assent . He would keep trying . He strained , humped , pulled at bark . " He slippin back even so ! " I cleared the kids off the trunk behind him and went up to where he was . Now what ? Straddling the trunk I leaned forward to give that great butt a push . Deryl moved his limbs inconclusively . I looked down ? against all wisdom ? and at the maple a few feet away . One had to reach out and fall to it with trust , and once on it considerable agility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself up on it , or would it tear through his hands as he fell ? Around about then , Deryl 's weakness and weight and fear came over me . For a time , we both weighed hundreds of pounds dead weight , clinging with spindly , numb , jelly arms and legs to a willow branch over a cliff . " I 'm comin back down , " Deryl said . " O.K. " We get the message slowly . It required one more child from a later group . Enticed stepwise , the girl Sheba had made it up to right beside the maple . On hands and knees , she could reach out sideways and just touch it . That was all . She would not make the move . Because she was facing down , the tears dropped straight from her eyes to the bark . I tried to jolly her with something about making it slippery for the children behind het ; then finally I reached up and brought her down . The grin of mastery they get and my puff of pleasure at seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which child has to pay how much .
