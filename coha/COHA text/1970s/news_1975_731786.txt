txt U.S. consumers hoping that the current flurry of antitrust activity in the food area will lead to lower supermarket prices may be in for a long wait . Such is the sober assessment of some of the economists , lawyers , and consumer advocates keeping close watch over the food-oriented investigations launched by both the Justice Department 's antitrust division and the Federal Trade Commission FTC . " Much as I wish otherwise , I just do n't think anything is going to come of it all , " says one economist . " For every complaint Issued in the food industry , there 's been one dismissed . " Also , there is wide agreement these days on the theory that all along the distribution line for food ? even at the beginning stages ? much of the job is concentrated in the hands of a few firms and that such concentration almost always breeds higher prices . But President Ford has pledged " vigorous " enforcement of antitrust laws ? recently made tougher by Congress ? as an Important weapon in the fight against inflation-recession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity . // *Food price cuts doubted // ? The FTC is in the midst of legal action against the nation 's largest cereal manufacturers ? Kellogg , General Mills , General Foods , and Quaker Oats ? for monopolistic practices . ?

A decade ago , for instance , an FTC suit against bakers in Seattle charging 24 cents a loaf for bread brought the price back to the 20 cent price prevalent elsewhere , saving consumers an estimated $3.5 million a year .

Those who are skeptical about the current antitrust activity say the problem is one of money , manpower , and the determination to withstand political pressure . The combined budget of both government antitrust divisions for instance is less than $30 million for fiscal 1975 . Far from all of it will go for the food probe . In Justice , for instance , it is widely assumed that the bulk of the legal antitrust staff will be fully occupied with the recently filed case against American Telephone and Telegraph Company and the coming trial of the International Business Machines suit . Political will ' doubted " I do think all the activity could lead to a difference in food prices but I do n't think the agencies have the political will to carry it all through ?
