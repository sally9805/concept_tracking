When Monopoly was first marketed 40 years ago , its manufacturer was certain that a complicated , long-running game centered on the acquisition of Atlantic City real estate would have a short run for its funny money .

Sounding like Monopoly 's J.P . Morgan , Brady suggests ways of driving competitors out of business by bluff , capital acquisition or snapping up cheap properties that will appreciate in value .
