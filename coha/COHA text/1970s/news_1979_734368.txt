txt Q. &A.; Soviets will expand Cuba force : Stone Troop buildup is a test , says Florida senator By John Maclean Chicago Tribune Pre " ser , WASHINGTON  --  The disclosure that there are several thousand Soviet combat troops in Cuba has caused a political controversy , which endangers Senate ratification of the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty SALT Ill . Sen. Richard Stone ID. , Fla. ) , long a leader in expressing concern about Soviet activities in Cuba , said the troops clearly represent an open challenge to the Carter administration . Here is an edited version of an interview with Stone : Q ? What Is the danger to American interests from 2,000 to 3,000 Soviet troops in Cuba ? A ? Well , there was a similar size force of Soviets which turned out to be guarding the missiles the last time we had a crisis in Cuba . I am not asserting that this force is there to do that . But the size is not as important as the nature of the force . It is a combat-organized force with artillery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it constitutes a base . To have a Soviet military base in this hemisphere and to operate it is to abandon the letter and spirit of the Monroe Doctrine , the Rio Treaty , and the President 's public commitment of last year that the U , S. government would oppose // Soviets testing U.S. in Cuba , Stone says // any Soviet direct or indirect effort to establish a military base in the Western Hemisphere . Q ? Who is threatened ? Should Central American countries be concerned about it ? A ? Yes , and we should , too . Q ? How do you mean , " We , too " ? A ? Well , in the absence of a firm response to this test , which clearly is a test , we would face further escalations by the Soviets in this hemisphere , possibly in the targeted countries in Central America of El Salvador , Guatemala , and Honduras , possibly in other Caribbean Islands such as Grenada , possibly , not directly , by the Soviets in any other area in Latin America , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviets increasing froces within Cuba . Q ? So you are saying that if we do n't ship it now , that the Soviet presence will increase ? A ? I think there is no doubt about that . Q ? What is your judgment on how the Soviet combat troops came to Cuba ? is this something that has happened in the last six months ? Is it something that happened Di years ago and we have only now notided it ? A ? The best evidence I have is that it happened in a substantial way in 1976 . In addition to direct and indirect bits and pieces that I have learned about in the last month or so , we have the testimony of Gen. Daniel Graham last week in the SALT hearings . When ' I asked him when he left as chief of the Q. &; A. Defense Intelligence Agency , the date he told me was Jan. 1 , 1976 . I then asked him , did you have any evidence for the existence of this brigade prior to that ? He said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , it seems clear that the introduction of the main force at the very least is after Jan. 1 , 1976 . Q ? Yeu do nt ' think it is possible or probable that these are units which have simply been pulled together in recent times from various parts of the island ? A ? It is not likely . Q ? What motive do the Soviets have with a small combat force at a base in Cuba ? Why are they doing It ? A ? Well , if the introduction of the units was early 1976 , then one main feature is to test the resolve of this administration in the same way that earlier administrations have been tested in Angola and elsewhere . That is one very possible motivation for doing it . Secondly , there is the belief , which is current in the Cuban exile community in Miami , that for every " X " number of Cuban soldiers sent abroad , the Soviets commit to send " V " Soviet troops or commit themselves to send " Y " number of Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the commonly held belief in the South Florida Cuban community is a proper measurement of this but it is widely held . Q ? Is it their belief that Soviets come to replace Cuban troops as a means of making sure that there is no domestic revolt ? A. That is a third possibility . The second one that I have just mentioned to you has to do with buttressing both their own Cuban regime resolve and providing visible evidence of Soviet support for those overseas efforts . All these are possible motives until the Soviets either say what their motives were or it emerges as to what their motives really were . Q ? In other words , we do n't know ? A ? We really do n't . Q ? Do you think there has been a failure of American intelligence in this case ? A ? I think there has been an insufficiency of devotion of resources to the gathering of intelligence regarding Soviet efforts and Cuban efforts , particularly in and about Cuba . Q ? Can you he specific ? A ? I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , and that when I asked for an increase in gather . ing efforts and the administration wanted to and they did , that is when they were able to get the confirmation of the brigade size force . That is in the last three weeks . So when we have extra resources , we get extra information and it turns out to be crucial . Q ? Well , at one point , the administration voluntarily suspended spy plane flights over Cuba . A ? Yes . That is public . Q ? Do you think that was a mistake ? A ? I think aerial surveillance ought to be a resource that we can use and it does n't even have to be overflights strictly . It still can be aerial surveillance of one kind or another and other types of surveillance . But in the light of the more assertive Cuban positions in this hemisphere and elsewhere , I think that increased surveillance is a must . Q ? Let 's clear up a couple of points . The letter you got from Secretary of State Cyrus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of August ? A ? July 27 . Q ? And this said that there was no Soviet combat unit ? A ? It said there were no military forces other than the MAG , the Military Advisory Group , and there was no base . Q ? You do n't feel , or do you , that that was a lie ? A ? Let me just say that that was wrong and it was incorrect . Q-There have been accusations from Fidel Castro and others that the administration timed the disclosure of the information with the opening of the nonaligned nations conference in Havana . A ? I think that is not the case in any way , shape or form . What happened was that some intelligence information and some rumors have leaked , and the issue had been publicly raised . Whereupon , we increased our intelligence surveillance , and that produced the confirmation . It took several weeks to get it , and it took at least a week to be sure we had it . That is why it took that long . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am positive that the administration would have much preferred not to have this conjunction of events .
