VRDOLYAK , powerful chairman of the City Council 's Buildings and Zoning Committee , Sunday denied any wrong doing in helping to approve a zoning change for property that he sold for $80,000 just 10 months after purchasing it for &beat; $16,000 . Vrdolyak said that he has not committed any Improprieties in the transactions and denied that the sale price was contingent on the rezoning . Vrdolyak issued a written statement Sunday night in response to a story , in SUnday'a editions of The Tribune disclosing Vrdolyak 's land dealings . Vrdolyak was not available to answer questions about the statement , which was read to reporters by an attorney from his law firm . The attorney said Vrdolyak would be available 41 his aldermanig office Monday morning to answer questions . In his statement , Vrdolyak said that he had been out of town on a fishing trip with two of his sons at the time The Tribune tried unsuccessfully to contact him before printing the story . Vrdolyak said in his statement that " I am quite confident that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed or suggested that any impropriety had occurred . " The land in question is on the southeast corner of Avenue 0 and 16th St. in Vrdolyak 's 10th Ward , not tar from his home at 11445 Avenue J. VRDOLYAK CONFIRMED The Tribune report printed Sunday that he made a huge profit by buying 12 Southeast Side lots from a group of women in June , 1977 , for $32,000 , or $2,667 per lot , and then selling 6 of the lots last April to the First Savings and Loan Association of Hegewisch for $50,000 , or $10,000 a lot ( Vrdolyak had earlier helped the women who sold him the land by getting a rezoning for some other nearby proerty they owned . The savings and loan recently came before Vrdoiyak 's committee , and the city council and got zoning for ' the six lots changed from residential to business use . IN EXPLAINING the sudden Jump In the value of the lots , Vrdolyak said that in July , 1977 , a month after he bought the land , Burger King , Inc. , sent him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build a fast-food franchise sin ' the 12 lots they would value the land at // $100,000 . They also guaranteed Vrdolyak a $10,000 a year profit . Vrdolyak admitted that Burger King could not erect a restaurant on the land unless It was rezoned . Nevertheless , when the savings and loan subsequently inquired about buying six of the lots , Vrdolyak said he based his /taking price on the Burger King appraisal . Ho said he offered the six lots to the savings and loan for $00,000 , and the savings and loan accepted . As an explanation of why the savings ' and loan paid $80,000 for six lots when they were still zoned for residential and not commercial use , Vrdolyak said it was " reasonable for Hegewisch to assume that it would obtain the zoning . " TWO OTHER financial Institutions made similar zoning requests earlier that had been granted , Vrdolyak said . The president of the savings and loan , Vincent Ginalski , told The Tribune that he was not aware the land was zoned residential when he purchased it for the association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Ginalski said he purchased the land for a savings and loan office , and that the land had " no value " to the association without the rezoning . In his statement Sunday night , Vrdolyak also confirmed that at no time during the hearing before his committee on the proposed rezoning , nor during the City Council meeting Tuesday , did he make public his past ownership of the land or abstain from voting . City Council Rule 14 says that an alderman shall not vote in a matter in which he is personally interested , and a state law bars a public official from receiving  --  either directly or indirectly ? anything of value to influence his vote . Vrdolyak said that he did not violate the council rule because he had no interest in the property at the time of the rezoning from residential to business for the savings and loan , the First Savings and Loan Association of Hegewisch . " There was a six-month hiatus between the binding purchase contract for the land and Hegewisch 's zoning request , " he said . Vrdolyak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rule 14 would have been " unfair to the savings and loan . " VIID0LYAK SAID that his sales contract with the savings and loan contained " no contingencies as to zoning . " He said , " I could have died or run for higher office or left politics and gone into the newspaper business and liegewisch would still be the owner regardless of what happened to the zoning after the purchase .
