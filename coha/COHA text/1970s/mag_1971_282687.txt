About three centuries after the concept of a free press was first postulated , the Vatican got around to endorsing it last week . A 20,000-word " pastoral instruction , " circulated to Roman Catholic bishops throughout the world , condemned censorship in mass communications ( except as a " last extremity " ) and decreed that " freedom of speech for individuals and groups must be permitted so long as the common good and public morality be not endangered . " The document , which was approved by Pope Paul , also contended that the relationship between the church and the press should " be distinguished by integrity , truth and openness . " There should be " a steady two-way flow of information between the ecclesiastical authorities at all levels and the faithful as individuals and as organized groups . " Newsmen in Rome , who have long suffered under the Vatican 's own restrictive information policy , now hope that the Holy See will practice what it preaches .                 @ @ @ @
