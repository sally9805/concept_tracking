CREVE COEUR by Tennessee Williams <P> Tennessee Williams was lionized this past week at the second annual Spoleto Festival U.S.A. in Charleston , S.C. , but there was more to it than celebrity worship . Williams was on the receiving end of a wave length of personal affection that surely extends far beyond Charleston . It is not difficult to guess why . Over many years , and in all of his plays , Williams has brought to his characters , who are wounded in heart and bruised in spirit , the healing hands of a dramatic poet of great compassion . <P> That compassion is evident once again in his newest work , Creve Coeur . Unfortunately , some of the gifts that have made Williams such a formidable dramatist are sadly in abeyance . The pulse of conflict beats feebly . The surge of musical eloquence , which was once like a river cresting in flood , is in Creve Coeur little more than a ripple on a placid pond . <P> While the play might qualify as tragicomedy , it is more closely related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Louis in the mid- ' 30s , though that means more in attitude than in geography . The plot is bare-bones simple . Dorothea ( Shirley Knight ) is a blonde schoolteacher who has read the handwriting on the blackboard . She is spooked by incipient spinsterhood . A recent brief liaison with the school principal , a flighty socialite named Ralph T. Ellis , has lodged the romantic hope in her mind that she is his intended . Bodey ( Jan <P> Miner ) , her best friend and a kind of Falstaffian mother-hen realist , knows better , partly because she has read the morning society news announcing Ellis ' fiancee . It is not Dorothea . <P> Bodey hides the paper to spare Dorothea , but she can not , of course , hide it from the audience- thereby spiking any hope of dramatic surprise . The second act brings in the bad-news girl , Dorothea 's fellow teacher Helena . Helena ( Charlotte Moore ) is an antiseptic snob with faintly lesbian leanings who wants Dorothea to abandon her tacky flat and move in with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the situation is that these are women alone , who at best are merely pooling their losses . <P> Yet humor salvages their plight . Some of it is sheer vaudevillian antics - Dorothea doing body-wrenching calisthenics in her negligee , the half-deaf Bodey fidding with her hearing aid and trying to camouflage it with an outlandish flower , or Miss Gluck ( Barbara Tarbuck ) , on whom coffee acts as an emetic , rushing to the bathroom to throw up . But more of the comedy springs from Williams ' absurdist juxtapositions and mocking putdowns . <P> With the actresses he has at his disposal , Williams does not have to send in the Marines . Like a magnifying glass , Knight can turn a role into a pinpoint of fire . With glares , hand signals and gusto , Miner kneads her part like the earthy dough of life , and if there is such a thing as cancer of the temperament , Moore displays a terminal case . <P> The theme of Creve Coeur , finally , is valor . Toward the end of the play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go on , go on - that 's all life seems to offer or demand . " That has always been Tennessee Williams ' credo , and he is scarcely likely to abandon it now now . <P> <P> - T.E.Kalem
