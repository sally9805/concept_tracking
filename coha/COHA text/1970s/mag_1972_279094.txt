Richard Nixon has often insisted that jawboning particular industries to hold down prices is not an effective way to fight inflation-but last week he resorted to it anyway . The President opened a campaign to persuade automakers to cancel a proposed price boost on 1973-model cars , even though the increase seems justifiable under the guidelines of the Government 's own Price Commission . By week 's end he had won a partial victory . General Motors , whose price moves are usually followed by the other automakers , offered to trim its increases by more than a third , to an average $59 per car or truck . Ford soon followed suit , offering to roll back its price hike to $59 also . <P> Whether that will satisfy the Administration remains to be seen . Cost of Living Council Director Donald Rumsfeld , who managed the White House side of the confrontation , had pronounced himself " encouraged " by G.M. 's offer . But he had also pointedly added that he hoped that Ford would withdraw its proposed price increases entirely . The Government also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public hearings on car prices Sept. 12 , at which it will hear such industry critics as Ralph Nader and United Automobile Workers President Leonard Woodcock . By the time the Commission finishes sifting the testimony , Rumsfeld predicted , it will be mid-October before any price boosts can be approved . That would be a full month after the first 1973 models go on sale . <P> The idea of supplementing formal price controls with White House jawboning came from Rumsfeld . Like other Administration officials , he worries that the public still does not believe that inflation is being defeated , even though the rate of price increases is coming down ( see following story ) . The President is known to share this concern , and apparently thinks that he needs some spectacular victory over inflation to talk about in the campaign . At any rate , he gave Rumsfeld the go-ahead to set up meetings in the White House with chiefs of the auto companies . They were invited by telegram to discuss " the impact " of the price increases that they sought , then urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked to reply by week 's end . <P> The increases , which in G.M. 's case would average $90 a vehicle , seem solidly grounded on cost data . Most of the money would go to cover the expense of installing new equipment that is required under federal law on ' 73 cars . The mandatory improvements include stronger bumpers , fire-resistant upholstery fabrics and devices to lessen the amount of smog-producing oxides of nitrogen in auto exhausts . In addition , the companies tacked on new costs for improvements in plant safety and factory antipollution controls , also required by law . Finally , the proposed price rises include a small amount covering product improvements initiated by the companies ; G.M. , for example , will install stronger hood latches on its ' 73 cars . Under Price Commission rules , companies usually can pass on to their customers increases in real costs , and the automakers ' applications appeared to meet that test . In an oddly timed announcement late last week , the Government 's Bureau of Labor Statistics calculated the factory value of improvements on ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
