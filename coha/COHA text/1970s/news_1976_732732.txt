txt Senator Walter F. Mondale , the Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate , assailed United States foreign policy today as one that is frequently " indifferent to people seeking greater justice " and that feels " threatened by movements demanding greater equality . " Mr. Mondale , in a speech to the Time magazine leadership conference here , called for a readjustment of American foreign policy toward a " proper concern for the so-called third world " and away from the support of governments " such as the military junta in Chile . " He said that the United States could no longer impose its viewpoint on the world but " can not escape the role of leadership . " Any " new definition of American leadership , " he said , , " must involve a commitment to change " and must be one " that deals effectively with the global problems " that affect all mankind . This country , he said , must make clear " in every international forum , that we are on the side of democracy and social justice . " Returning to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Mondale said that at present , that policy is not truly representative of American purposes and ideals . He also spoke briefly about two subjects to which he devoted an entire speech in San Francisco at the beginning of his campaign : United States arms sales and the growing danger of nuclear proliferation . He said he did not believe that the United States had " anywhere near put forth the pressure that we should on our allies " to discourage the sale of nuclear technology such as recent sales by West // Germany to Brazil and by France to Pakistan . But the stress in this speech was on the necessity  --  both moral and pragmatic - for the United States to assert its leadership in humanitarian areas , particularly among the less-developed coun-tries , who , he warned , " otherwis may become implaccable enemies . " - Mr. Mondale said that the approximately half-billion people now living on the eidg , e of starvation " will not just die quietThe United States . he said , " does riot have to rank 12th in per capita .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is , he went on , " no excuse for giving 50 percent more aid to middle-ince:Tie nations " than to less-developed ccuntries. - 'Senator Mondale did not mention that Congressional reluctance has been a major factor in inhibiting United States friVolvement in assisting the third world in the last few years , but spoke always of " leadership " and " the Government " in criticizing policy . r , , The reference to the United States ' 12th-ranking status , an adviser said , was to , its membership in the 17-country Development Assistance Committee , a group of the world 's major aid-dispensing countries . , Mr. Mondale echoed Jimmy Carter , the Democratic Presidential candidate , in calling for " new trade and commodity arrangements that help protect countries living on the margin from the boom-andbust cycles of the past , while assuring ciyr own access to vital supplies . " " We can vevitalize our aid efforts and our participation in international development organizations , " he said .

We can and should stimulate the production of food so that other nations may become more self-sufficient . " The speech was Mr. Mondale 's second venture into the specifics of foreign policy , although he has frequently criticized American policy as expedient and lacking in idealism . This speech , like all of his major addresses , was written in the Carter-Mondale headquarters in Atlanta , although Mr. Mondale rarely sticks to a text and always makes extensive changes in any speech written for him . It was reportedly decided in Atlanta that this speech on these particular aspects of foreign policy would be given by Mr. Mondale rather than by Mr. Carter . Global Environment Discussed Mr. Mondale also talked about the deterioration of man 's environment on a global scale as one of the urgent foreign policy problems facing the country . " As a nation we can no longer afford to be guided by leaders whose vision of America 's security is so insensitive to the profound changes which pose an everdeepening crisis on this planet  --  lack of food , polluted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development , destruction of the environment , and the pressing need to create a more stable , more productive system of international economic security .
