Ashland Oil Inc . Chairman Orin E. Atkins recently hung on his office wall a color portrait of Cartoonist Al Capp 's renowned detective , Fearless Fosdick , Swiss-cheesed by bullet holes . Says Fosdick : " Fortunately , these are merely flesh wounds . " <P> Atkins ' fondness for the painting is easy to understand . During the past two years , Ashland has been convicted twice of violating the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 by making illegal corporate political contributions in the U.S. , and also had been charged with filing misleading reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission that concealed payoffs to overseas politicos . In January , Ashland even adjourned its annual meeting for fear that the SEC would invalidate the election of directors . Last week , though , the agonies of Ashland finally may have ended . At the meeting reconvened with SEC approval at company headquarters in the river town of Ashland , Ky. , stockholders voted 97% in favor of re-electing the entire board and defeated by 93% a proposal that the company formally affirm its political nonpartisanship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ashland signed a consent decree admitting to no guilt but promising , in effect , not to make illegal political donations in the future . It also bared many secrets . In June the company submitted a 539-page report , prepared by a special committee of the board , containing exhaustive information on how Ashland executives had managed to divert corporate assets into an $800,000 U.S. political slush fund that was kept hidden in a safe . The report also indicated that from 1967 to 1972 a CIA operative was on Ashland 's payroll , and that the CIA reimbursed the company for part of his salary . <P> The SEC was not totally satisfied . Hoping to set a precedent for other corporations that have refused to disclose who got political payments , the agency further insisted that Ashland publicly reveal the recipients of all the payments made between 1967 and 1973 , when its illegal contributions first came to light . Reluctantly , Ashland earlier this month made public through the SEC a list of domestic and foreign payments totaling $1.2 million . Democrats received the largest cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included . Among the larger payments : <P> &gt; $100,000 to Richard Nixon in 1968 for his election campaign . <P> &gt; $50,000 all together to Democratic National Committee Chairman Robert Strauss in 1970 and 1972 for use by the committee . <P> &gt; $50,000 to Arkansas Democratic Congressman Wilbur Mills hi 1972 to help elect Democratic candidates to Congress . <P> &gt; $100,000 to Nixon 's Committee to Re-Elect the President in 1972 . <P> The company also reported nearly $400,000 in previously disguised and therefore suspect payments , made in countries where the company has had major interests in oil exploration or production . Samples : $100,000 in 1970 to a Libyan consultant , and $150,000 to President Albert-Bernard Bongo of Gabon in 1972 for oil exploration permits .
