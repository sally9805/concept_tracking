 | An Open Letter to My Son 's Teacher He is four now , this son of mine , and I watch him more closely these days than ever , sensing that soon I will half-lose him to friends , to school , to neighborhood . We sit , the two of us , at our big , sun-dappled table , our lunch plates shoved aside to make room for books and paints and paper . We read together , taking turns . We laugh and savor the sunlight and our full stomachs . It is a rare and peaceful moment . We think up rhymes . We draw . Painstakingly he makes a lineup of his special men , all wearing hillbilly hats over frowzy mounds of hair , square mouths packed full with teeth , neckties dangling to their toes . The Partridge Family , he explains . Who else ? More drawings : ferry , boats , tanks , cranes , cowboys . I think back to when he was two and accidentally penciled an H. He blinked several times , lowered his head to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he screamed , " An H , an H , an H , " and fell off his ( continued on page 184 ) 93 ... .. .. s. . .. 1 i warm and safe and happy . Does n't sound like an itinerant bandsman , Snowflake . " " My kind of home goes with you anywhere . I was n't asking for the future wrapped in a package . But I need a love I can believe in . " Mitch 's smile began in his eyes , and lit his face with a warm current of love and laughter . " Am I supposed to make rash promises to a woman who cuts her hair and refuses to talk to me and who has never once said . .. . " I love you , " said Sharon carefully . " And I 'll let my hair grow . " " I do n't think I can wait . Better marry me now . Ah , Sharon , I love you ! Please believe me ... . " And Sharon , believing , lifted her lips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page 93 chair . He filled the paper with H 's , dashed off to tell others about the H , and for weeks thereafter I found great , crooked H 's in books , on toys , sidewalks , fences , and unfortunate walls . Last summer I took to sitting silently at windows and under our pear tree watching my boy , Brad , and his friends : Leo , who is four ; Robert , six and already having trouble in school ; Maureen , a motherly nine ; Sonny , seven and mentally retarded ; Bobby , nine ; Amy , Kelley , and Susie , six , three , and seven . No homogeneous grouping this ! I watched them climb trees , build forts and rocket ships and sand castles , produce puppet shows , hammer wooden boats , sell lemonade , collect leaves and insects , dismantle an old motor , chat with the postman , inspect the work of repairmen . I heard them sing songs , coin words , shout riddles , and sometimes scream epithets at one another . I marveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination , at their " everything is possible " attitude . I watched them as they wondered . . . where the squirrels sleep , where the baby birds went , why the leaves turn , how you build a butterfly net . I helped them to plant seeds , make pudding , mix paints , organize a parade , find answers in books . But mostly I just watched . And thought . About children . About learning . About schools . And about you , the teachers . On the first day of school , I met one of Brad 's friends ( Maureen , the nine-year-old ) , and asked her what her class was like . " Oh , okay , " she said . " Any good stuff there ? " I asked . " Like what ? " " Oh , games , puzzles , animals , that sort of thing . " She gave me one of those are-you-putting-me-on ? looks that children are famous for . " School 's not for playing , " she said . " It 's for learning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could go to school , " real school , not nursery school . " " Next year , " I told him . That did n't satisfy him . How wilt . I ever learn anything if I do n't go to school now ? I wondered if he 'd ever learn as much in school as he and the others had learned this summer . I have been a teacher . I have also visited scores of schools , as a writer : street schools , ghetto schools , multiunit schools , open schools , educational parks , segregation academies ? in Harlem and Scarsdale , North Dakota and New Mexico . I know how schools , and sometimes whole communities , can hem teachers in ; how teaching guides and plans and schedules and tests can turn them into little more than clerks and often entirely erase their creative energies and daring . One morning I followed Brad 's older friends to school . It is a pleasant school compared to some I have seen ? large , airy , quiet and clean , with smiling , efficient teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the posters , the cutouts , the nameplates on the children 's lockers were teachers ' creations , and the few pieces of children 's artwork hanging in the halls looked oddly cramped and uniform . Large groups of children walked in silent double-file along the right sides of the corridors . I peeked in at Susie and Robert and a few of the others in the classrooms and found them sitting 4 5 quietly at their desks , dutifully following teachers ' instructions or listening , eyes glazed , to lectures . The only laughter I heard was in the gym , and even there the children 's play seemed automatic and rote , carefully teacher-directed . I saw the faces of those children who had delighted my summer days , but I did not see those children , their eyes alight with wonder , their minds and hands wrestling and waltzing with life . And so I write this letter . . . to say what ? Not to beg of you to turn your classrooms into summer backyards where children can chase butterflies and lie with their bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible . But I also know that it 's impossible to nurture a child 's natural thrust toward learning in a room stripped clean of the stuff of life , where there 's no time for what is happening in a child 's heart and head . The message in most schools is unmistakable and indelible : Knowledge is what 's in books and teachers ' heads . Be quiet ; be still ; be obedient : come up with Right Answers , and you will succeed . The things you care about ? your friends , your play , your innermost dreams ? have nothing to do with this place . School is something that someone does to you . I do not come to you asking , as some parents do , that you teach my son to read immediately , that you teach him French in the first grade , that you help him " adjust to a group situation , " that you make him smart so he 'll be a winner . I only ask that you protect what he is and give him a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ask you to know him and respect him and learn from him and his life , so that he will learn from you and yours . Do n't " motivate " Brad , " behavior modify " him , pigeonhole him as a Bluebird , his friend as a Robin . Do n't groom him for Yale or General Electric . Do n't tell him his trees do n't look like trees . Do n't tell him that English is one thing and Science is something else and Math another thing entirely and that none has anything to do with riding bicycles and going camping . What I 'm asking is that you find a way to treasure and delight in Brad 's crazy and troublesome questions , his need to touch and talk with his fellows , his digressions , his depths , his total lack of sequence . No simple request , this ! But it 's what I want for my child ? for all our children . One of the questions that preoccupies me is that of the parents ' " place " in the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show up for conferences , raise money for band instruments . In some cities , we help design curricula , hire and fire teachers , serve as classroom volunteers . Perhaps there is something more crucial and ultimately more valuable that all of us can do . Perhaps we must begin to truly reveal our children to their teachers , especially when they are very young and we know them so well . Reveal them not boastfully , not defensively , but openly and honestly . But we also must help teachers find a way to create rich and responsive environments in which our children can reveal themselves , and grow . This may mean taking on teachers ' tedious and time-consuming chores . Scrounging classroom materials . Protecting them from administrative wrath . Marshaling support of other parents . Refusing to accept grade cards , ability grouping , and other life-destroying gimmicks . Demanding that teachers be treated as people and professionals . I suppose that much of this letter sounds presumptuous . I , a parent , telling a teacher how to teach ! And yet that is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describe a way of thinking about children and learning that can manifest itself in a variety of classroom forms . I am saying that I , like most parents , believe my child and his childhood to be a rare and precious thing . He has but one childhood and it is filled with wonder and curiosity and adventure and optimism . If these qualities are protected and nourished he will grow into a healthy , creative man . I believe that classrooms which respect and provide for these qualities of childhood are warm and exciting places to be . For children . And for teachers . 1 S S S C
