silence of about twenty seconds followed . Then the Neanderthal said , " Yes , I remember now . ' " Very good , Kazz . Now , forget it again , though what I told you then still is a command . Is n't that right ? ' " Yes , that 's right . ' " Now , Kazz . Has Burton ever said anything to you about this Ethical ? Or about anyone , man or woman , who claimed to be one of those who brought us back from the dead ? ' " No , Burton-naq never told me anything like that . ' " But if , in the future , he does tell you , you will come to me at once and tell me . You will only do this , however , when no one else is around . Where no one can overhear us . Do you understand that ? ' " Yes , I understand . ' " If for some reason I am not available , if you can not get hold of me because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell Peter Frigate or Lev Ruach , instead of me . Do you understand ? ' " Burton said , in a low voice , " Ruach , too ! " " Yes , I understand . I will tell Peter Frigate or Lev Ruach instead of you. , " And you will tell them only when no one is around , where no one else can overhear you two . Understand ? ' " Yes , I understand . ' " And you will not tell anyone else about this , you will only tell Frigate , Ruach , or myself . Understand ? ' " Yes , I understand . ' " Very good , Kazz . That 's fine . We will go now , and when I snap my fingers twice , you will not remember this or the first time . Understand ? ' " Yes , I understand . ' " Kazz , you will also ... oh , oh ! Someone 's calling for us ! No time for an excuse now . Let 's go ! ' " Burton had to guess what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell Kazz what he should say if anyone asked him what the conversation had been about . That was a lucky break for Burton . If Kazz had had a reasonable story , then Burton would never have become suspicious.  |p151BURTON  SAID , " SIT DOWN , KAll . MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE . YOU SITthere for a minute . I 'm leaving . Monat will be coming in , and he will talk to you . " " I understand . " Burton walked out of the hut and stood for a minute . He should have posed as Monat when he first started the session . That might have overcome Kazz 's resistance more quickly , and Burton would not have had to resort to the trickery of the bear and Besst . He re-entered , and said , " Hello , Kazz . How are you ? " " I 'm fine , Monat . How are you ? " " Great ! Very well , Kazz . I 'll take over from where your friend , Burton , left off . We 'll go back to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had noticed that Frigate and I had no marks on our foreheads . You now remember that time , Kazz , because I , Monat , tell you to do so . " You will go back to the second after you had told Monat . Are you there ? " " Yes , I am there . " " Where are you , Monat , and Frigate ? " " We are near a grailstone . " " What day , or night , is that ? " " I do not understand . " " I mean , how many days was it after Resurrection Day ? " " Three days . " " Tell me what happened after you spoke to them about the lack of the mark . " Kazz , speaking in a monotone , described the events immediately after . Monat had said that he and Frigate wanted to speak to him privately . They had walked across the plain and gone into the hills . There , behind a giant irontree , Monat had fixed his eyes upon Kazz 's . Without the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was doing , Monat had hypnotized him.  | " It was as if something dark flowed from him to me , something dark and overpowering . " Burton nodded . He had seen Monat demonstrate this power , this " animal magnetism " as it was known in Burton 's time . He was a stronger mesmerist than Burton , which was one reason why Burton had never permitted the Arcturan to attempt hypnotizing him . In fact , Burton had taken precautions against getting caught unawares by Monat . In an elaborate self-hypnosis , he had told himself that he must never allow himself to be mesmerized by Monat . However , Monat could be powerful enough to break down that command , so Burton had been extremely cautious about being alone with him . That forearming had been based on the fear that Monat might stumble across the time when he had been visited by the Ethical . That was Burton 's secret , one he wanted no one to know . He had had no idea then , of course , that Monat was one of Them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fellow had never given any indication that he was . However , he had refused to let Burton try mesmerism on him . His plea had been that he could not endure the thought of losing his self-control . Kazz remembered that , during the course of the session , Monat had remarked to Frigate about the Neanderthal 's ability to see the symbols . " We never knew about that . We 'll have to tell HQ as soon as we get a chance . ' " So , Burton thought , Monat and Frigate were in communication from time to time with the Ethicals . How did they manage that ? Were prearranged landings of the flying machines , which Burton had once glimpsed , one method of communicating ? Those machines which flickered into and out of visibility as they flew along ? Those two must have been watching him closely . That was one of the reasons the Mysterious Stranger had visited him at night during a storm . The Ethical must have known that Monat and Frigate were in Burton 's party . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his guard . Perhaps he had meant to do so , but he had been hurried . He 'd said that the Ethicals were coming soon in their flying machines . And he had left abruptly . Even so , he surely would have mentioned so grave a matter . A few words would have warned him . Why had he not done so ? Was it possible that he did not know that Monat and Frigate were with him ? And Ruach , too . He must not forget Ruach . Why had three agents been assigned to him ? Would n't one have been enough ? Also , why was one so conspicuous as the Arcturan given the job ?  |p153Whatever  the reasons for this , the matter of the lack of signs on the heads of the three agents was more pressing . Evidently , Ethicals , firstorderor second-order , did not have such marks . Now that they were aware that Neanderthals could observe this , they had made sure that Kazz would not say anything about it . Moreover , Monat had then told Kazz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the foreheads of himself and his two colleagues . Why had he not then installed a command that Kazz would see these signs on everybody who did not have them ? Perhaps he thought that it would not be necessary . The chances of running across other Neanderthals , never a numerous people , were slight . Still , it would have eliminated any exposures of agents from then on . The explanation might be simple . Monat would have had to describe the marks of every agent in the valley . Inasmuch as there might be hundreds , or thousands , for all Burton knew , that would have been impossible . Monat had not been too wrong in thinking that encounters with Neanderthals would be rare . In fact , Burton had never seen more than a hundred . All of these except Kazz and Besst had been passed by swiftly and at a distance during the day . Yet , they had come across Besst . He tried to recollect the exact circumstances under which she had been met . It was three years ago that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populated largely by fourteenth-century A.D. Chinese and ancient Slays . Besst was living with a Chinese , but she had made it evident from the first that she wished to go on the boat with Kazz . It was dark , so she would not have noticed anything unusual about Frigate and Monat  --  aside from the latter 's being nonhuman , of course . The two had gotten together and talked until late that night . When her liutmate had ordered her to come with him , she had refused . There was a tense moment when it looked as if the Chinese were going to attack Kazz . Discretion won . He realized that , though he was bigger than the Neanderthal , he was also much weaker . Though very short , Kazz 's massive bones and muscles made him stronger than any but the most powerful of modern men . In addition , his brutal face was enough to scare anybody . The two had gone aboard to spend the night together . Yet they must have gone to sleep before dawn . Could Monat have gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he had done it . But Besst had never said anything about Frigate 's and Monat 's marks.  |p154Kazz  finished his account of the session . It was short and what Burton had expected . He sent Kazz after Besst , telling him to be very quiet . In a few minutes he was back with her . Burton told her he would satisfy her curiosity later . For the time being , would she let him hypnotize her ? Sleepily , she agreed , and she sat down on the chair Kazz had occupied . After telling her he was Monat , he took her back to the mesmerizing by Monat . As he had thought , it had been done after she and Kazz had gone to sleep . Monat had simply described to her the marks which he had hypnotized her mate into seeing on the three agents ' foreheads . Then he had ordered her to see the same marks . The whole process would have been done very quietly and quickly . Monat and his colleague had been lucky . Before Kazz had encountered Spruce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , the first time had been on Resurrection Day . He had called out to the man , asking him why he had no mark . The man had fled , probably not because he understood what Kazz was saying but because he had misunderstood the Neanderthal 's intentions . Later , after meeting Burton , Kazz had tried to tell him what he had seen , but neither could speak the other 's language yet . And Kazz had simply forgotten about it in the days following , when they were all busy trying to survive . The second person he 'd seen lacking a mark was a woman , a Mongolian . This had happened at high noon , and the woman had just come out of The River , where she was bathing . Kazz had tried to talk to her , but her hutmate , who did have a mark on his head , had taken the woman away . Evidently , he was jealous . Once more , Kazz 's intentions were misunderstood . At that time , Burton and the others had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kazz had stayed behind to watch their boat . After the woman had gone , Kazz was offered some drinks of lichenalcoholby several people who wanted to talk to him . These had never seen a Neanderthal before , and the liquor was an inducement to get him to talk . Kazz , easily induced and seduced by free booze , was half-drunk by the time his crewmates returned . Burton had reproached him so harshly that Kazz had never again drunk while on guard duty . He also forgot about the woman . After bringing Besst out of the trance , Burton sat for a while in thought . Besst and Kazz shifted uneasily and gave each other wondering looks . Finally , he made a decision . There was no longer any use keepingp155them in the dark . Nor would he exclude Alice from now on . He owed the Stranger nothing , and the fact that he had not reappeared again could mean that he , Burton , had no reason to keep silent . Besides , though he was naturally secretive , he longed now to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he took over an hour . Both Besst and Kazz were amazed , and they had many questions . He held up his hand for silence . " Later ! Later ! As of now , we must question them . The Arcturan 's a much tougher customer , so we 'll tackle Frigate first . " He told them what they must do . Kazz said , " But would n't it be best to knock out Monat and tie him up ? What if he wakes up while we 're getting Frigate ? " " I do n't want to make any more noise than we have to . If Loghu and Alice hear us , we 'll have a brouhaha . " " A what ? " " An uproar . Let 's go . " The three of them made their way through the fog . Burton thought of some more questions he would ask Frigate . For instance , Monat , Frigate , and Ruach must have known that Spruce was an agent . There had been plenty of opportunity for them to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had opportunities after the revolt to hypnotize Kazz so he would see a mark on Spruce . Why had he not done that ? If Monat had not been able to get to Kazz after the revolt , he should then have told Spruce to leave the area at once . Or , at least , to wear a cloth around his head when conditions were favorable for seeing the mark . Could Spruce not have known that they were his fellow agents ? They might be so numerous that each was familiar only with a few others . But surely all would know of Monat . He stopped , and drew in his breath . The Mysterious Stranger had never said anything about having his own agents . Yet , he was a renegade , and he might have enlisted a few highly trusted people . Could Spruce have been one ? And could Monat somehow have found this out ? And so gotten rid of him by not telling him about Kazz 's visual abilities ? That did not seem probable . If Monat had found out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would he ever be able to do that ?  --  would he not then have hypnotized Spruce ? That would enable him to identify the Stranger , supposing , of course , that Spruce knew who he was . There was another possibility . Monat knew of Spruce 's ability to kill himself by means of the sphere on his forebrain . Thus , he was not worriedp156that Spruce would be forced to divulge any information at all . Also , he may have used Spruce as a messenger . He would have given him some information to pass on when Spruce was resurrected at HQ  --  if HQ meant headquarters . Monat had taken part in Spruce 's inquisition . How amused he must have been at that . Also , it was Monat who had given Spruce some leading questions . Had Spruce been prepared by Monat to give the answers he had made ? Were they all lies ? If so , why should he lie ? Why were all resurrectees kept in the dark ? It was quite possible that Spruce , acting on Monat 's orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By then , the three had boarded the Shark . The Neanderthals stayed above . Burton felt his way to the cabin , down the companionway , and , counting the compartment doors , stopped outside Frigate 's and Loghu 's . He opened the door slowly and stepped inside . It was a very small space , just large enough to hold two bunks against the bulkhead and room to climb down from them . The bunk-chambers were the only places whereany privacy was available . Even defecation was done in them , in thebamboo chamber pots which were stored in a rack to one side . Frigate usually slept in the top bunk . Burton moved forward , his hand outstretched . He would wake him gently , whisper that it was his watch , and then he would follow him to the deck . There Kazz would knock him out , and he would be carried to the hut . Since it would be impossible to keep him from killing himself once he was fully conscious , Burton had decided to try to mesmerize him as he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he would have to try it . Frigate , unlike Spruce , might not be so willing to commit suicide now that there were no more resurrections . However , Burton was not sure that the Ethicals ' agents were not resurrected . His fingertips felt the smooth sideboard of the bunk . They moved up onto the cloths that served as a mattress . They stopped . Frigate was not in his bunk . Burton felt along the cloths though he knew that nobody was on the bunk . They were warm . Then he stood for a minute . Had Frigate gone above to relieve himself because he did not want to awake Loghu ? Or had he awakened early and decided to talk to his captain a few minutes before going on guard duty ? Or had he ... ? Burton felt furious . Had he sneaked out of bed and now was with Alice ?  |p157Feeling  ashamed of himself , he rejected that idea . Alice was honest . She would never betray him . If she wanted another lover , she would have said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Nor did he believe that Frigate would ever do anything like that to him , though he may have contemplated it in his mind . He bent down and reached out until he touched cloth . His fingers moved along , traced a curve  --  Loghu 's breasts under the cloth  --  and he backed out and closed the door . Silently , his heart thudding so fast he could almost believe that it could be heard throughout the cabin , he moved to Monat 's partition . His ear against the door , he listened . Silence . He straightened , opened the door , and felt into the upper bunk . Monat was not there , but he could be sleeping in the lower bunk . If so , his breathing was not audible . His hand slid over unoccupied cloths . Cursing softly , he groped back to the deck . Kazz stepped out of the fog with his fist raised . " Wallah ! What 's the matter ? " " They 're both gone , " Burton said . " But ... how could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe Monat knew that something was wrong . He 's the most sensitive person I 've ever met ; he can read your slightest expression , detect the feeblest nuance in your voice . Or perhaps he heard you wake up Besst , investigated , and guessed the truth . For all I know , he may have been listening to us outside the door of the hut . " " Neither Besst or me made any noise . We was as silent as a weasel sneaking up on a rabbit . " " I know . Look around . See if our launch is missing . " He met Kazz coming around the other way . " The boats 're all here . " BURTON ROUSED LOGHU AND ALICE . WHILE THEY DRANK HOT COFFEE , HEoutlined everything that had happened to him in connection with the Ethicals . They were stunned , but they kept silent until he had finished . Questions hailstormed him then , but he said that he would answer themp158later . It would be dawn shortly , which meant that they had to put their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one who had not said anything . It was evident from her narrowed eyes and tight lips that she was furious . " I am sorry that I had to keep all this from you , " Burton said . " But surely you can see how necessary it was ? What if I told you everything and then the Ethicals had grabbed you , as they did me ? They could have read your mind and discovered that they had erred in thinking they had erased relevant portions of my memory . " " They did n't do so , " she said . " Why should they have even thought of that ? " " How do you know they did n't ? " he said . " You would n't remember it if they had done it . " That gave her another shock . Nevertheless , she did not speak again until after breakfast . This took place in unusual weather . Normally , the sun quickly burned off the fog . The sky was clear the rest of the day in the tropical zone or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clouds quickly gathered , rain fell for fifteen minutes or so , and then the clouds disappeared . This morning , however , black masses rolled between sun and earth . Lightning flickered as if chips of the bright sky above the clouds were falling through . Thunder was the muttering of a giant behind the mountains . A pale light spread over the land , staining it brownish-yellow . The faces around the grailstone ' looked as if a blight had settled upon them . Kazz and Besst hunched down uneasily over their food and looked around as if they expected an unwelcome visitor . He muttered in his native tongue , " **29;4286;TOOLONG is walking . " Besst almost whined . " We must find a hut to hide in . It is not good to be near the water when he walks . " The others looked as if they were going to seek shelter , too . Burton stood up and said loudly , " One moment , please ! I 'm interested in finding out if any of you are missing a boat ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my crew deserted last night , and it 's possible that they stole a boat to get away . " Forgetting about the coming storm , the party scattered to look along the bank . Within a minute , a man reported that his dugout was gone.  | " They 're far away by now , " Kazz said . " But did they go up or down ' 1 hr River ? " " If there was a signal system in this area , we could find out quickly enough , " Burton said . " Unless , of course , they beached their boat and went into the hills to hide . " Alice said , " What do we do now , Dick ? If we stay here to look for them , we 'll not be able to get on the Rex . " Burton stifled the impulse to tell her not to point out the obvious to hicn . She was still simmering ; no sense in making her boil again . " Monat and Frigate can hole up today and sneak out tonight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to catch them . No , we 'll try to get aboard the paddlewheeler . But those two will come along some day , and when they do ... " " We 'll tear them apart ? " Kazz said . Burton shrugged and spread his palms upward . " I do n't know . They 've got the advantage . They can either drop dead on us or lie to us . Until we get to the tower ... " Alice spoke then , her eyes dark with accustomed reverie : " If at his counsel I should turn asideInto that ominous tract which , all agree , Hides the Dark Tower . Yet acquiescingly I did turn as he pointed ; neither prideNor hope rekindling at the end descried , So much as gladness that some end might be . " For , what with my world-wide wandering , What with my search drawn out thro'years , my hope Dwindled into a ghost not fit to copeWith that obstreperous joy success would bring -- I hardly tried now to rebuke the springMy heart made , finding failure in its scope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To view the last of me , a living frameFor one more picture ! in a sheet of flameI saw them and I knew them all . And yetDauntless the slug-horn to my lips I setAnd blew , Childe Roland to the Dark Tower came . ' "  |p160Burton  grinned savagely . " Browning would have thought ... must think ... that this world is even stranger than the setting of his outre poem . I appreciate your sentiment , even if he said it first , Alice . Very well , we will go to the Dark Tower . " " I do n't know what Alice was talking about , " Kazz said . " Anyway , just how 're we going to get on that boat ? " " If King John has room for us , I 'll offer him our treasure trove , our free-grails . That should appeal even to the ungreediest heart . " " And if he does n't have room ? " He was silent for a moment . That tickle in the back of his brain , that feeling that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alice was speaking . And now he saw , or thought he saw , the means for scratching the itch , the kind of chain binding the agents together . How did they recognize each other ? Monat was no problem ; he did not need identification . But what kind of secret signal would the human agents use to identify each other ? If they possessed a Neanderthal 's ability , they could see the negative signal , lack of a sign , in their colleagues ' foreheads . Suppose , though , they did not have this ability ? Spruce had been surprised when he found out about Kazz 's optical talent . Though he had not said so , his manner had indicated that he had never heard of such a thing . Evidently , machines were used to detect and translate the symbols into whatever meaning they had . That would probably be done in the PR bubble or whatever HQ was . If , then , they could not see the symbols with the naked eye , they would have another means of identification . Suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A period of time at which no more people from Earth were resurrected , not , at least , on this planet . According to Monat , Frigate , Ruach , and Spruce , that cutoff date had been 2008 A.D.What if that was not the true date ? What if it were earlier than 2008 A.D. ? He had no idea what the true date would be , though he had never met anyone , except the agents , who claimed to have lived past 1983 A.D. From now on , he would question every late-twentieth-centurian he met . And if 1983 was the latest at which anybody had died , then he would be fairly certain that that was the cutoff point . So ... perhaps the Ethicals had contrived a fiction which would enable them to identify each other instantly . That was that they had lived duringp1612008 A.D. And , of course , there would be a fixed story about events from 1983 , or whatever date it was , to 2008 . Which meant that perhaps it was untrue that the Arcturans had killed most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have happened . In fact , anything he had heard about the years 1983-2008 might be a lie . Yet , there was Monat . He was not a Terrestrial . There was no reason to believe that he had not come from a planet of the Bear Watcher . For the present , there was no way to explain his presence on The R iverworld . Meanwhile , Burton had two means for catching an Ethical . Kazz was one ; the 2008 story was another . However  --  humanity lived not only in an as-if world , it was a but-if world , too  --  however , just possibly the agents had been recruited from a time past 1983 . So , their stories could be true . There were so many possibilities . For instance , how did he know that Monat , Frigate , and Ruach had told him the truth about what had happened to them when they were away from him ? There was that incident when Frigate had claimed he had met the publisher who had cheated him on Earth . Frigate said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nose . There were bruises on Frigate , supposedly gotten during the fight with Sliarkko and his gang . Those could have come from conflict with others , though . Frigate 's nature was such that he dreaded violence , physical or verbal . He might fantasize revenge , but he would never carry it out . Suppose , just suppose , that the agents adopted disguises based on reallifeTerrestrials . What if there was an actual Peter Jairus Frigate somewhere on this planet ? The pseudo-Frigate could be pretending to be the man who had had such an intense interest in Burton 's life . That would be one means of getting close to Burton , of making sure that Burton would let him attach himself to Burton . After all , if would be bard for any man to be indifferent to his biographer , to a person who seemed to worship him . Yet , why would it be necessary for an agent to adopt such a disguise ? Why not make up one from whole cloth ? Perhaps it was not necessary , it was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person he was pretending to be , that was highly unlikely . " There were so many potentialities , so many questions to be answered.  |p162Alice  said , " Dick ! What 's the matter ? " He came out of his reverie with a start . Everybody except his crew and the man whose boat had been stolen had fled . The man looked as if he would like to ask for reparations but was hesitating because he had no one to back him up . A wind was whipping the waves of The River and ruffling the thatches of the huts . The Snark thumped against the bumpers of its dock . The light had gone from brownish-yellow to pale grey , making the faces around him even more ghastly . Across the water lightning flashed its fiery tooth , and thunder bellowed like a bear in a cave . Kazz and Besst were obviously longing for him to give the word to look for shelter . The others were only somewhat less nervous . " I was thinking , " he said . " You asked what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us ? Well , monarchs have means for making room if they wish to do so . And if he refuses , I 'll find some way to get aboard . I 'm not going to be stopped by anything or anybody ! " Lightning struck nearby , cracking as if the back of the world had broken . Kazz and Besst led the headlong flight for the nearest building . Burton , standing in the heavy rain that had immediately followed the bolt , laughed at them . He shouted , " On to the Dark Tower ! " IN THE DREAM , PETER JAIRUS FRIGATE WAS GROPING THROUGH A FOG . HEwas naked ; somebody had stolen his clothes . He had to get home before the sun rose and burned the fog off and exposed him to the derision of the world . The grass was wet and scratchy . After a while he got tired of walking on the shoulder of the road , and he stepped onto the asphalt pavement . Now and then , as he trudged along , the fog would thin a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . Somehow , he knew that he was far out in the country . Home was a long way off . But if he walked fast enough , he could make it before dawn . Then he 'd have to get into the house without waking his parents . Thep163doors and windows would be locked , which meant that he 'd have to throw pebbles against the second-story window in the back . The rattle might wake his brother , Roosevelt . But his brother , though only eighteen , was already a heavy drinker , a skirt chaser , roaring around on his motorcycle with his sideburned , leather jacketed dese-and-dem pals from the Hiram Walker Distillery . This was Sunday morning , and so he 'd be snoring away , filling the small attic bedroom he shared with Peter with stinking whiskey fumes . Roosevelt was named after Theodore , not Franklin Delano , whom his father hated . James Frigate abominated " that man in the White House " and loved The Chicago Tribune , which was delivered on the doorstep every Sunday . His oldest son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except for the comics . Ever since he had learned to read , he 'd eagerly awaited every Sunday morning , right after the cocoa , pancakes , bacon , and eggs , for the adventures of Chester Gump and his pals in quest of the city of gold ; Moon Mullins ; Little Orphan Annie and her big Daddy Warbucks and his pals , the colossal magician Punjab and the sinister The Asp , and Mr. Am , who looked like Santa Claus , was as old as the Earth , and could travel in time . And then there was Barney Google and Smilin ' Jack and Terry and the Pirates . Delightful ! And what was he doing thinking about those great comic-strip characterswhile walking naked along a country road in dark , wet-with-evil clouds ? It was n't difficult to figure out why . They brought a sense ' of warmth and security , happiness even , his belly filled with his mother 's good cooking , the radio turned on low , his father sitting in the best chair reading the opinions of " Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room floor with the comics page spread out before him , his mother bustling around in the kitchen feeding his two younger brothers and his infant sister . Little Jeannette , whom he loved so much and who would grow up and go through three husbands and innumerable lovers and a thousand fifths of whiskey , the curse of the Frigates . All that was ahead , fading now from his mind , absorbed by the fog . Now he was dwelling in the front room , happy ... no , it too faded away ... he was outside the house , in the backyard , naked and shivering with the cold and the terror of being caught without his clothes and no way of explaining why it happened . He was throwing pebbles against the window , hoping their rattle would n't wake up his little brothers and sister sleeping in the tiny bedroom below and to one side of the attic bedroom . The house had once been a one-room country schoolhouse outside the mid-Illinois town of Peoria . But the town had grown , houses sprang up allp164around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mile to the north . A second story and indoor plumbing had been added sometime during the growth of this area . This was the first house he had lived in in which there had been an indoor toilet . Somehow , this once-country house became the farmhouse near Mexico , Missouri . Here he , at the age of four , had lived with his mother , father , and younger brother and the family of the farmer who 'd rented out two rooms to the Frigates . His father , a civil and electrical engineer ( one year in Rose Polytechnic Institute in Terre Haute , Indiana , and a diploma from the International Correspondence School ) had worked for a year at the generating plant in Mexico . It was in the farmyard behind the farmhouse that Peter had been horrified to see a rooster swallow a mouse caught in a trap in his bedroom the night before and then tossed into the barnyard . He had been even more horrified on realizing that chickens ate animals and he ate chickens that ate animals . That had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cannibalism . That was not right , he thought . A cannibal was a creature that ate its own kind . He turned over and passed back into sleep , vaguely aware that he had been half-waking between segments of this dream and mulling over each before passing on to the next . Or he had been redreaming the entire dream each time . In one night he would have the same dream several times . Or a dream would recur a number of times over several years . The series was his specialty in dreams or in fiction . At one time , during his writing career , he had twenty-one series going . He 'd completed ten of them . The others were still waiting , cliff-hangers all , when that great editor in the skies arbitrarily canceled all of them . As in life , so in death . He could never  --  never ? Well , hardly ever  --  finish anything . The great uncompleted . He 'd first become aware of that when , a troubled youth , he had poured out his torments and anxieties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be his psychology teacher . The professor , what was his name ? O'Brien ? He was a short , slim youth with a fiery manner and even fierier red hair .. And he always wore a bow tie . And now Peter Jairus Frigate was walking along in the fog and there was no sound except for the hooting of a distant owl . Suddenly , a motor was roaring , two lights shone faintly ahead of him , then brightly , and the motor screamed as he screamed . He dived to one side , floating , slowly floating , while the black bulk of the automobile sped slowly toward him . As he inched through the air , his arms flailing , he turned his head towardp165it . Now he could see , beyond the glare of its lights , that it was a Duesenberg , the long low , classy roadster driven by Cary Grant in the movie he 'd seen last week , Topper . A shapeless mass sat behind the wheel , its only visible features its eyes . They were the pale-blue eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaiser . Then he was screaming because the car had swerved and headed directly toward him and there was no way he could escape being hit . He woke up moaning . Eve said sleepily , " Did you have a bad . . . ? " and she subsided into mumbles and a gentle snoring . Peter got out of bed , a short-legged structure with a bamboo frame and rope supports for a mattress made of cloths magnetically attached around treated leaves . The earthen floor was covered with attached cloths . The windows were paned with the ising-glasslike intestinal membrane of the hornfish . Their squares shone faintly with the reflected light from the night sky . He stumbled to the door , opened it , walked outside , and urinated . Rain still dripped from the thatched roof . Through a pass in the hills , he could see a fire blazing under the roof of a sentinel tower . It outlined the form of a guard leaning on the railing and looking down The River . The flames also shone on the masts and rigging of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard was n't on the tower , which meant that he would lx. down by the boat . He 'd be questioning the boat 's skipper . It must be all right , since there were no alarm drums beating . Back in bed , he considered the dream . Its chronology was mixed up , which was par for dreams . For one thing , in 1937 , brother Roosevelt had been only sixteen . The motorcycle , the distillery job , and the peroxided blondes were still two years away . The family was n't even living in that house anymore . It had moved to a newer , larger house a few blocks away . There was that amorphous , sinister dark mass in the car , the thing with his grandmother 's eyes . What did that mean ? It was n't the first time he had been horrified by a black hooded thing with Grandma Kaiser 's almost colorless blue eyes . Nor the first time he 'd tried to figure out why Rhr appeared in such horrendous guise . Ile knew that she had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother take care of him just after he 'd been born . His mother had told him that his grandmother had also taken care of him when he was five . He did n't remember , however , ever seeing her before the age of twelve , when she had come to this house for a visit . But he was convinced that she had done something awful to him when he was an infant . Or it a as something which had seemed awful . Yet she was a kindly old lady ,  |p166though  inclined to get hysterical . Nor did she have any control at all over her daughter 's children when they were left in her care . Where was she now ? She 'd died at about seventy-seven after a long and painful siege of stomach cancer . But he 'd seen photographs of her when she was twenty . A petite blonde whose eyes looked a lively blue , not the washed-out red-veined things he remembered . The mouth was thin and tight , but all the adults in her family were grim lipped . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very tough time but would never break under the strain . The Victorians , judging by their photographs , were a hard-nosed , stiffspinedlot . His German grandma 's family had been made of the same stem stuff . Persecuted by their Lutheran neighbors and the authorities because they had converted to the Baptist church , they left Oberellen , Thuringia for the land of promise . ( Peter 's family on both sides had always opted for the religion of the minority , usually a somewhat crank religion . Maybe they were trouble seekers . ) After years of moving from one place to another , never finding a single street paved with gold , after backbreaking labor , soul-searing poverty , and the deaths of many children and finally of parents and grandparents , the Kaisers had made it . They had become well-to-do farmers near , or owners of machine shops in , Kansas City . Was it worth it ? The survivors said that it was . Wilhelmina had been a pretty , blue-eyed blonde of ten when she had come to America . At eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probably to escape poverty . It was said that old Bill Griffiths was part-Cherokee and that he had been one of Quantrill 's guerrillas , but there was a lot of malarkey in Peter 's family on both sides . They were always trying to make themselves look better , or worse , than they really were . Whatever old Bill 's past , Peter 's mother never wanted to talk about it . Maybe he was just a horse thief . Where was Wilhelmina now ? She 'd no longer be the wrinkled , bent old woman he 'd known . She 'd be a good-looking , shapely wench , though still with the vacuous blue eyes and still speaking English with a heavy German accent . If he should run across her , would he recognize her ? Not likely . And if he did , what could he find out from her about the traumas she 'd inflicted on her infant grandson ? Nothing . She would n't remember what would have been minor incidents to her . Or , if she did , she surely was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If indeed the dark deed had ever been done . During a brief stint of psychoanalysis , Peter had tried to break through the thick shadows of repressed memory to the primal drama in which hisp167grandmother played such an important role . The effort had failed . More extended attempts in dianetics and scientology had resulted in zilch also . He had kept on sliding past the traumatic episodes , like a monkey on a greased pole , on past his birth and into previous lives . After being a woman giving birth in a medieval castle , a dinosaur , a prevertebrate in the postprimal ocean , and an eighteenth-century passengerin a stage coach going through the Black Forest , Peter had abandoned scientology . The fantasies were interesting , and they revealed something of his character . But his grandmother evaded him . Here , on The Riverworld , he had tried dreamgum as a weapon to pierce the thick shadows . Under the guidance of a guru , he had chewed half a stick , a heavy load , and dived after the pearl hidden in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrible visions , he found his guru , battered and bloody , unconscious on the floor of the hut . There was no mystery about who had done this deed . Peter had left the area after making sure that his guide would live without serious aftereffects . He could not stay in the area nor could he feel anything but guilt and shame whenever he saw his guru . The fellow had been very forgiving , had , in fact , been willing to continue the sessions  --  if Peter was tied up during them . He could not face the violence that he felt dwelt deep within him . It was this fear of violence in himself that made him so afraid of violence in others . The fault , dear Brutus , lies not in the stars but in our lousy genes . Or in failure of one 's conquest of one 's self . The fault , dear Brutus , is in our fear of knowing our self . ' Ile next , almost inevitable , scene in this drama of recollection was the seduction of Wilhelmina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teal , since it was possible that he would meet her . After some mutual questioning , they would discover that they were grandmother and grandson . Then the long talk with her telling what had happened to her daughter and her husband ( Peter 's father ) and her grandchildren and prat-grandchildren and **25;4317;TOOLONG . Would she be horrified when she found out that a great-granddaughter had married a Jew ? Undoubtedly . Anyone of rural stock born in 1880 was bound to be deeply prejudiced . Or what if he told her that his sister had married a Japanese ? Or that a brother and a first cousin had married Catholics ? Or that agreat-granddaughter had converted to Catholicism ? Or that a greatgrandsonhad become a Buddhist ? On the other hand , The Riverworld might have changed her attitudes ,  |p168as  it had done to so many . However , many more were as psychologically fossilized as when they had lived on Earth . To get on to the fantasy . After a few drinks and long talk , bed ? Rationally , one could not object to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when did people ever think rationally in such situations ? No , the thing to do would be to say nothing about their relationship until after they 'd been to bed . The construction crumbled then . To reveal that would make her grievously ashamed . It would be cruel . And no matter how much he wanted revenge , he could not do that to her . To anyone . Besides , it would be revenge for some act that he only thought might have been committed . Even if it had occurred , it might have been something only a child would have thought terrible . Or something misinterpreted in his infant mind . Or something that she , being a product of her times , would have thought only natural . It was exciting to think about laying your grandmother . But , in reality , it just would n't happen . He was sexually drawn only to intelligent women , and his grandmother had been an ignorant peasant . Vulgar , too , though not in an obscene or irreligious way . He remembered when she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd sneezed , the snot had landed on her blouse , and she had wiped it off with her hand and deposited it on her skirt . His father had laughed , his mother had looked stricken , and he had lost his appetite . There went the whole fantasy , dissolved in disgust . Still , she might have changed . To hell with it , he told himself , and he turned on his side and went to sleep . DRUMS BEAT , AND WOODEN TRUMPETS BLEW . PETER FRIGATE WOKE UP IN THEmidst of another dream . It was three months after Pearl Harbor , and he was an air cadet at Randolph Field being chewed out by his flight instructor.  |p169The  lieutenant , a tall young man with a thin moustache and big feet , was almost as hysterical as Grandma Kaiser . " The next time you turn left when I tell you to turn right , Frigate , I 'm bringing us in right now , cutting the goddamn flight , and I 'm refusing to go up with you ! You can get an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student kills him or not ! Jesus Christ , Frigate , we coulda been killed ! Did n't you see that plane on your left ! Are you suicidal ! That 's all right with me , but do n't take me and two others with you ! And do it on your own time , off the field , and not with government property ! What the hell is the matter with you , Frigate ! Do you hate me ! " " I could n't hear you , sir , " Peter said . Though he was sweating in the heavy flight clothes in the warm room , he was shivering and he felt a painful urge to urinate . " I just ca n't seem to hear through those tubes . " " There 's nothing wrong with the tubes ! I could hear you all right ! And there 's nothing wrong with your ears ! You had a medical checkup only two weeks ago , did n't you ? All you pissy-assed cadets are examined when you transfer here ! Are n't you ? " Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were . " The lieutenant , his face red , eyes bugging , said , " What do you mean by that ? Are you saying I was a pissy-assed cadet ? " " No , sir , " Peter said , feeling the sweat pour out from his armpits . " I would never say pissy-assed ' in reference to you , sir . " " What would you say ? " the lieutenant said , almost screaming . Peter looked from the corners of his eyes at the other cadets and instructors . Most of them were paying no attention or pretending not to . Some were grinning . " I would never mention you , " Peter said . " What ? Because I 'm not worth mentioning , is that it ? Frigate , you try me ! I do n't like your attitude on the ground or in the air . But to get back to the subject despite all your efforts to avoid it ! Why in hell ca n't you hear me when I can hear you ? Is it because you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dangerous , Frigate ! It 's frightening , too . You scare the hell out of me ! Do you know how many of those stubby-winged BT-12 's spin in every week ? Those sons of bitches have got a builtin spin , cadet . Even when an instructor tells his ape-brained student to spin it deliberately , and he 's got his hand on the stick , ready to take over , the sons of bitches tr , tnietimes still keep on spinning ! " " So I sure as hell do n't want to tell you to turn right and have you think I 'm telling you to spin her and catch me off guard . You could have us twenty feet deep in the ground before I could take to the chute ! Okay , wh.it is the matter with your ears ? "  | " I do n't know , " Peter said miserably . " Maybe it 's wax . Wax builds up in my ears . It 's a family trait , sir . I have to have the wax blown out every six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wax out of another place than your ears , mister ! Did n't the doctor check out your ears ? Sure he did ! So do n't tell me it 's wax ! You just do n't want to hear me ! And why ? God knows why ! Or maybe you hate me so much you do n't care if you die just so you take me with you ? Is that it ? " Peter would not have been surprised to see the lieutenant foaming at the mouth . " No , sir . " " No , sir , what ? " " No , sir , to any of that . " " You mean you 're denying everything ? You did turn left when I said turn right , did n't you ? Do n't tell me I 'm a liar ! " " No , sir . " The lieutenant paused , then said , " Why are you smiling , Frigate ? " " I did n't know I was , " Peter said . That was true . He was really in mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're crazy , Frigate ! " the lieutenant shouted . A captain , standing behind him , frowned . But he made no move to interfere . " I do n't want to see you again , Frigate , until you have a written testimonial from a doctor that your ears are okay . Do you hear that ? " Peter nodded . " Yes , sir , I hear you . " " You 're grounded until I get that report . But I want it at flight time , tomorrow , when I take you up again , God help me ! " " Yes , sir , " Peter said and almost saluted . That would have been another excuse for the instructor to ream him out . Saluting was not done in the flight room . He looked back as he checked in his parachute . The captain and the lieutenant were talking earnestly . What were they saying about him ? That he ought to be washed out ? Maybe he should be . He really could n't hear his instructor . Only half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tubes . It was n't because of wax . Or the high altitude . Or anything physically wrong with his hearing . It would be years later before he knew that he just did not want to hear the lieutenant . " He was right , " Peter said.  | " Who was right ? " Eve said . She was sitting up in bed , leaning on one arm , looking down at him . Her body was covered with thick varicolored towels tabbed together , and the hood still shrouded her face . Peter sat up and stretched . The inside of the hut was dark ; the drums and bugles along the bank sounded faintly . Nearby , a neighbor was banging on his fish-skin-and-bamboo drum as if he were trying to wake up the whole world . " Nothing . " " You were groaning and mumbling . " " Earth is always with us , " he said , and he left her to figure that out for herself . With him he took the thunder mug to the neighborhood deposit hut which was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men and women , all on the same task . They dumped the contents of the pots into a large bamboo wagon . After breakfast , this would be hauled out of the building by a team of men into the foothills to the base of a mountain . There the excrement would be treated to make potassium for black gunpowder . Frigate worked two days a month there and four days on the sentinel towers . A grailstone was just on the other side of the hill on which their hut stood . Usually , he and Eve took their grails to it . This morning , however , he wanted to talk to the crew of the boat that had arrived during the night . Eve would not object if he went by himself , since she had to finish stringing necklaces of hornfish vertebrae , varicolored helical bones in demand as ornaments . She and Frigate traded them for tobacco and liquor and flints . Frigate also made boomerangs and , occasionally , dugouts and canoes . Frigate carried his grail with his left hand and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his waist held a sheath containing a chert axe . A quiver of arrows , flint tipped and fletched with thin , carved bones , was slung over one shoulder . A bow of yew , wrapped in bamboo paper , was strapped to the quiver . The strings , made of riverdragon gut , were wrapped inside the quiver to protect them from the early-morning moisture . The little state of which he was a citizen , Ruritania , was not at war or under threat of war . The law requiring that all have their weapons handy was a hangover from the old days of turbulence . Obsolete laws had almost as hard a time dying here as on Earth . Social inertia was everywhere , though its resistance to change varied from state to state . Frigate walked among the huts spread out over the plain . Hundreds , covered like him from foot to head against the chill , joined him . About ap172half-hour after the sun rose , they began to shed their cloths . While eating breakfast , Frigate looked for new faces . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Razzle Dazzle . They sat in a group , eating and talking to those interested in the newcomers . Peter sat down by them to watch and listen . The captain , Martin Farrington , also known as the Frisco Kid , was a muscular man of medium height . His handsome face looked Irish . His hair was reddish-bronze and curly ; his eyes , large and deep blue ; his chin , strong . He talked energetically , smiling often , cracking jokes . His Esperantowas fluent but not perfect , and it was evident that he preferred English . The first mate , Tom Rider , also known as Tex , stood about 5.08 centimeters or 2 inches shorter than Frigate 's 1.8 meter or 6 feet . He was what the pulp magazine writers of Frigate 's youth called " ruggedly handsome . " Not as muscular as the captain , he moved quickly though gracefully with a confidence that Frigate envied . His dark hair was straight and if his tanned skin had been two shades browner , he could have passed for an Onondaga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farrington , he was pleased to find some English-speakers in the crowd . His voice was a pleasant baritone which combined a Southwestern drawl with a Midwestern pronunciation . Frigate learned much about the crew just by listening to their uninhibited account of themselves . They were the usual motley collection met on the larger boats that wandered up and down The River . The captain 's woman was a nineteenth-century South American Caucasian ; the first mate 's , a citizen of the Roman city of Aphrodita of second century A.D. Frigate remembered that its ruins had been discovered by archaeologists in Turkey sometime around the 1970 's . Two of the crew were Arabs . One was Nur el-Musafir ( The Traveler ) . The other had been the wife of a captain of a South Arabian ship which had traded with the southwest African empire of Monomotapa in the twelfth century A.D.The Chinese crewman had ended his Earthly life by drowning when Kubla Khan 's invasion fleet was destroyed by a storm enroute to Japan . There were two eighteenth-centurians , Edmund Tresillian , a Cornishmanwho lost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the French Bellona off Cape Finisterre . Pensionless , and with a wife and seven children , he was reduced to begging . Caught stealing a purse , he died in prison of a fever while waiting for his trial . The second man , " Red " Cozens , had been a midshipman on the Wager , a rebuilt Indiamanp173merchant accompanying Admiral Anson 's flotilla on its voyage around the world . It had been wrecked off the coast of Patagonia . After innumerable sufferings and hardships , part of its crew had gotten to civilization , where the Spanish government of Chile imprisoned them for a while . However , poor Cozens had been shot and killed by a Captain Cheap a few days after the wreck in the mistaken belief that he was a mutineer . John Byron , the poet 's grandfather , also a midshipman then , had criticized Cheap for this in The Narrative of the Honourable John Byron ( Commodorein a Late EXPEDITION round the WORLD ) Containing An Account of the Great Distresses Suffered by Himself and His Companions on the Coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arrival in England , 1746 , etc. , London , 1768 . Frigate had owned a first edition of this book , in which he had found a description of an animal encountered by Byron which had to be a giant sloth . He would have liked to have run across Byron . The little man had to have been incredibly tough to survive his experiences . Later , he had become an admiral , nicknamed " Foul Weather Jack " by his sailors . Just about every time he put out to sea , his fleet was hit by a bad storm . Other interesting crew members were a late-twentieth-century Rhode Island millionaire and yachtsman ; an eighteenth-century Turk , a bos'n 's mate who had died of syphilis , a common sailor 's disease then ; and Abigail Rice , Earthly wife of an early-nineteenth-century second mate on a New Bedford whaler . Binns , the yachtsman , and Mustafa , the Turk , were obviously in love with each other . As Peter would find out later , Cozens , Tresillian , and Chang shared Abigail Rice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband was spending two to three years chasing whales . Perhaps nothing she should n't have been doing . Perhaps she had been so sexually xtarved on Earth that she had exploded here . And then there was Umslopogaas . Pogaas for short . He was a Swazi , ion of a king of that South African nation which had been enemies of the great Zulu people . He had lived during the expansion of the British and the Boers and the conquests of the bloody military genius , Shaka . On Earth , he had killed twelve warriors in duels ; here , at least fifty . He would have been unnoticed by history , despite his fighting prowess , it he had not happened to be attached in his old age to the mission of Sir Theophilus Shepstone . With Shepstone was a young man , H. Rider Haggard , who had been much attracted by the stately figure and the tallstories of the old Swazi . ( laggard was to immortalize Umslopogaas in  |p174three  novels , Nada the Lily , She and Allen , and Allan Quatermain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which must have disturbed his model . Now Pogaas lounged near the ship , leaning on a long-handled war-axe of flint . He was tall and slim and his legs were extraordinarily long . His features were not Negroid but Hamitic , thin lipped , hawk nosed , and high cheekboned . He seemed friendly enough , but there was something about his bearing that told all but the most insensitive that he was not to be trifled with . He was also the only person on the crew who did not help handle the ship . His specialty was fighting . Frigate was tinkled pink when he discovered the identity of this man . Imagine that ! Umslopogaas ! After talking to various crew members , Frigate went back to a spot near the two officers . From what he heard , they were in no hurry to get to any particular place . The captain did , however , comment that he would like to get to the headwaters of The River some day . Which was , to say , in a hundred years or so . Frigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Terrestrial origins . Farrington said he 'd been born in California , but he gave no birthdate or place . Rider said he 'd been born in Pennsylvania in 1880 . Yes , he had spent a lot of time , most of his life , in fact , in the West . Frigate swore softly . He had thought the two looked familiar . However , they wore their hair longer than on Earth and the lack of Terrestrial clothes gave them a different appearance . What Rider needed was a big white ten-gallon hat and a flashy pseudo-Western coat and breeches and a pair of ornamented cowboy 's boots . And a horse to sit upon . As a child , Frigate had seen him in just such garments and on a horse . That had been during a parade preceding a circus  --  Sells and Floto ? Never mind . Frigate had stood with his father on Adams Street , just south of the courthouse , and waited eagerly for his favorite Western film hero to ride by . And so the hero had , but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unhurt , he had swung into the saddle again , riding off to the mingled laughter and cheers of the crowd . He must have sobered up after that , for he gave a great demonstration of riding and roping in the Wild West Show following the main events . At that time , Frigate regarded drunkards as moral lepers and thus should have been completely disillusioned about Rider . But his worship of Rider was so intense that he was willing to forgive him . What a little prig he 'd been ! Frigate was well acquainted with Farrington 's portrait since he 'd seen it so many times in biographies and on the back of dust jackets . Frigate had begun reading his works at the age of ten , and when he was fifty-seven hep175had contributed a foreword to a collection of Farrington 's fantasies and science fiction . For some reason , both his heroes were traveling under false names . He , Peter Frigate , was not going to expose them  --  not unless he had to . No , he would n't da it even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with exposure , he would do so . He 'd do almost anything to get aboard theRazzle Dazzle . After a while , the Frisco Kid announced that he and Tex would now interview anyone who 'd like to sign on as a deckhand . Two folding chairs were set up on the end of the dock , and the " employment " line formed in front of the seated officers . Frigate immediately got into the line . Three men and a woman were ahead of him . This gave him a chance to listen to the questioning and to decide what he would tell his prospective employers . THE FRISCO KID , SITTING ON A FOLDING BAMBOO CHAIR AND SMOKING Acigarette , ran his eyes up and down Frigate . " Peter Jairus Frigate , heh ? American . Midwest . Right ? You look strong enough , but what 's your nautical experience ? " " Not much on Earth , " Peter said . " I used to sail a small boat on the Illinois River . But I 've done a lot here . I sailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in a year on a two-masted schooner like yours . " That was a lie . He 'd only shipped on the two-master for three months . But that was enough for him to know , literally , the ropes . " Hm . Did these ships make short local trips or were they on long voyages ? " " Long ones , " Frigate said . He was glad he had n't referred to the vessels as boats . Some sailors were very touchy about the distinction between " boats " and " ships . " For Frigate , anything on a river was a boat . But Farrington was a seafaring man , even if there were no more seas . " In those areas , " he added , " the wind was usually from up-River . So we were sailing close-hauled most of the time . " " Yeah , anybody can sail with the wind , " Martin Farrington said.  | " Why do you want to sign up ? " Rider asked suddenly . " Why ? I 'm fed up with life here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old thing day after day . I ... " " You know how it is on a ship , " Farrington said . " It 's cramped , and you spend most of your time with just a few people . And it 's pretty much the same old thing day after day . " " I know that , of course , " Frigate said . " Well , I 'd like to travel to the end of The River , for one thing . The catamaran I was on was going there , but it got burned during an attack by slavers . The schooner was sunk by a dragonfish while we were helping some locals fish for it . It was Moby Dick and the Pequod all over again . " " You were Ishmael ? " Rider said . Frigate looked at him . Rider was supposed to have been able to quote great chunks of Shakespeare , to be well read indeed . But that could have been Hollywood publicity crap . " You mean , was I the lone survivor ? No , six of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Was . . , ? " Farrington stopped , cleared his throat , and looked at Rider . Rider raised thick , dark eyebrows . Farrington was evidently considering how to rephrase the question . " Who were the captains of these two crafts ? " " The catamaran captain was a Frenchman named DeGrasse . The schooner captain was a rough son-of-a-bitch named Larsen . A Norwegian of Danish birth . He 'd been captain of a sealer , I believe . " Nothing he said about Larsen was true . But Peter could n't resist testing Farrington 's reaction . The captain 's eyes narrowed , then he smiled . He said slowly , " Was Larsen nicknamed Wolf ? " Peter kept his face blank . He was n't falling for that trap . If Farrington thought that he was trying to tell him circuitously that he recognized him , Farrington would not take him on . " No . If he had a nickname , it was Bastard . ' He was about six and a half feet tall and very dark for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . Did you know him ? " Farrington relaxed . He dubbed out his cigarette on a baked-clay ashtray , and lit up another . Rider said , " How good are you with that bow ? " " I 've been practicing for thirty years . I 'm no Robin Hood , but I can shoot six arrows in twenty seconds with reasonable accuracy . I 've studieditp177the martial arts for twenty years . I never look for a fight and I avoid one if it 's possible . But I 've been in about forty major actions and a lot of minor ones . I 've been badly wounded four times . " Rider said , " When were you born ? " " In 1918 . " Martin Farrington looked at Rider , then said , " I suppose you saw a lot of movies when you were a kid ? " " Did n't everybody ? " " And what about your education ? " " I got a B.A. in English literature with a minor in philosophy and I was a compulsive reader . Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , " Farrington said . There was a pause . Rider said , " Well , our memories of Earth get dimmer every day . " Which meant that if Frigate had seen Rider in the films and Farrington on the dust jackets of books , he did not remember them . The captain 's question about his education might , however , have a double interest . He would want a crewman who could talk intelligently about many matters . On Earth , Farrington 's forecastle companions had been brutal and illiterate , not exactly his soulmates . So , for that matter , had been most of the people he knew until he had gone to college . " We seem to have about ten in all to interview , " Farrington said . " We 'll make our choice after we 've talked to everybody . We 'll let you know before noon . " Peter wanted desperately to be chosen , but he was afraid that too much eagerness might put them off . Since they were , for some reason , traveling under pseudonyms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to sign on . Why , he did not know . " One thing we forgot , " Rider said . " We do n't have room for more than onr hand . You ca n't take your woman along . Is that okay ? " " No problem . " " You can take turns with Abigail , " Rider said . " If you do n't mind sharing with three others . And if she likes you , of course . But she has n't shown many antipathies so far . " " She 's a luscious woman , " Peter said . " But that sort of thing does n't Nppx  --  al to me . " " Mustafa kind of likes you , " Farrington said , grinning . " He 's been ryring you . " Frigate looked at the Turk , who winked , and he blushed . " ' That appeals even less . "  | " Just make that plain , and you wo n't be bothered by him or Binns , " Farrington said . " I 'm no homo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sails under the mast has ; every ship , naval or commercial , has been a viper 's nest of sodomy since Noah . Those two are real he-men , aside from their lack of interest in the fair sex . And they 're damn good sailors . So just tell them to back off . If , that is , we accept you . But I do n't want any bitching about being hard up . You can catch up when we go ashore , and if we lose a man you can get a woman for your bunkmate . She has to be a good sailor , though . Everyone pulls his weight on this ship . " " Abigail 's looking more appealing by the second , " Frigate said . Farrington and Rider laughed , and Frigate moved on . For a while , he stood by the dock area . This was a shallow bay which had been hacked with much labor out of the bank . Stone cut from the base of the mountains had been carried down here and used to line the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but these held mainly small catboats , lugboats , and catamarans . Two giant rafts with masts were tied up here , too . These were used for dragonfishing . A number of warcanoes , capable of holding forty men each , were beached near the rafts . Canoes and rowboats were putting out now for fishing . By noon , The River would be heavily salted with small and large boats . The Razzle Dazzle was too large to fit within the piers . It was anchored near the mouth of the bay behind a breakwater of large black rocks . It was a beautiful ship , long and low , built of oak and pine . There was n't a nail in it , and the pegs had been cut with flint . The sails were made of treated outer skin of the dragonfish , so thin they were translucent . The oaken figurehead was a full-busted mermaid holding a torch . The ship was a wonder , and the wonder was how its crew had managed to avoid having it taken from them . Many had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked past Farrington and Rider . The interviews were by no means over . Word had gotten around , and now there were about twenty men and ten women waiting in line . If this continued , the questioning might take all day . There was nothing he could do about it , so he shrugged and went back home . Eve was gone , which was just as well . There was no need to tell her what he was doing until he found out if he was leaving . If he was turned down , he 'd say nothing to her . Part of his duty as a Ruritanian citizen was to assist in alcohol-making . He might as well work off a half-day today . The labor would help keep him from worrying . He walked through the passes between the hills until these gave out . There were four more hills to climb , each increasinglyp179higher . The trees were thicker here ; the huts , fewer . Presently he was on top of the highest hill , which was at the base of the mountain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meters or about 6000 feet . A waterfall thundered about 91 meters or 100 yards away , spilling thousands of liters a minute into a pool . From this , the water ran in a broad channel which would thread a course through the hills to The River . Frigate passed by the fires , the wooden , glass , and stone equipment , and the odor of alcohol . He climbed up a bamboo ladder until he was on a platform placed against an area of stone from which lichen had not yet been removed . He reported to a foreman , who gave him a chert scraper . The foreman took from a rack a pine stick with Frigate 's initials cut into it . It bore alternating horizontal and vertical lines , the former indicating the days he 'd worked , the latter the number of months . " Next year you 'll be using a stick to scrape off the stuff , " the foreman said . " We 'll be saving the chert and flint for weapons . " Peter nodded and went to work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Technology on The Riverworld would go backward . Instead of progressing from a wooden to a stone age , humanity would reverse the procedure . Frigate wondered how he was going to get his flint-tipped weapons out of the state . If he sailed on Farrington 's craft he would , according to the law , have to leave his precious stones behind . The time put in by Frigate on this work was estimated by the foreman . Except for the sun , there were few clocks of any type . The little glass available was used in the alcohol-making process , so there were not even hourglasses . For that matter , the sand used to make the glass had been imported from a state 800 kilometers down-River . That had cost Ruritania several boatloads of tobacco and booze and piles of dragonfish and hornfish skins and bones . The tobacco and alcohol had been contributed by the citizens from their grails . Frigate had given up smoking and drinking for two months during this time of sacrifice . When It was over , he continued his abstinence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , as had happened on Earth and heir. , he had slipped back into the arms of Demon Nicotine . He worked hard , scraping off the thick green-blue plant growth from the black rock and stuffing it into the bamboo buckets . Others lowered the buckets on ropes to the ground , where their contents were dumped Into vats . Shortly before noon , he knocked off for the lunch hour . Before going down the ladders , he looked out over the hills . Far below , the white hullp180of the Razzle Dazzle shone in the bright sun . Somehow , he was going to be on it when it up-anchored . Peter walked back to the hut , noted that Eve was n't there , and went on down to the plain . The line of interviewees did not look any shorter . He passed along the edge of the plain where its short grass abruptly stopped and the long grass of the hills began . What made for the line of demarcation ? Were there chemicals in the hill soil that halted the encroachment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both ? And why ? The archery range was about half a kilometer south of the dock area . He practiced shooting at a target of grass on a bamboo tripod for about thirty minutes . Then he went to the gymnasium area and ran sprints and made long jumps and engaged in judo , karate , and spear-fighting for two hours . At the end of the time , he was sweating and tired . But he was bursting with joy . It was wonderful to have a twenty-five-year-old body , the tiredness and feebleness of middle and old age gone , the aches and pains , the fat , the hernia , the ulcer , the headaches , the long-sightedness , all no more . Replacing it , the ability to run or swim swiftly and far , to feel sexual desire every night ( and a good part of the day ) . The worst thing he had done on Earth was to get a desk job as a technical writer at the age of thirty-eight and then at fifty-one , to become a fulltime fiction writer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was monotonous work , but while his body was handling the hot , heavy work , his mind was busy dreaming up stories . At night he would read or write . It was when he had started to sit on his butt all day that he had begun drinking so heavily . And his reading had diminished , too . It was too easy after working on a typewriter eight hours a day to sit in front of the TV all evening and swill Bourbon or Scotch . TV , the worst thing that had happened to the twentieth century . After the atom bomb and overpopulation , of course . No , he told himself , that was n't fair . He did n't have to be a boob before the tube . He could have used the self-discipline which enabled him to write to turn the set off except at highly selected times . But the lotuseatersyndrome had gotten him . Besides , there were programs on TV which were really excellent , both entertaining and educational . Still , this world was good in that there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national production or paychecks or mortgages or medical bills . Or air or water pollution and almost no dust . And nobody gave a damn about communism or socialism or capitalism , because they did n't exist . Well , that was not quite true . Most states did have a sort of primitive communism.  |p181HE  WALKED TO THE RIVER AND PLUNGED IN , CLEANING OFF THE SWEAT . Then he trotted along the bank ( no huts allowed within 30 meters of it ) to the dock area . He hung around until dinnertime , talking to friends . In between , he watched the two from the Razzle Dazzle . They were sail interviewing , though lubricating their throats with frequent drinks . Was n't that line ever going to end ? Just before it was suppertime , Farrington stood up and announced in a loud voice that he was taking no more applications . Those still in the line protested , but he said that he 'd had enough . By then the head of Ruritania , " Baron " Thomas Bullitt , had appeared with his councillors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his day . In 1775 he had explored the Ohio River falls by the area which would become Louisville , Kentucky . Commissioned by the William and Mary College of Virginia , he surveyed the area . And thereafter disappeared from history . His aide-de-camp , Paulus Buys , a sixteenth-century Dutchman , was with him . Both invited the crew of the Razzle Dazzle to a party in their honor that night . The main reason for the invitation was to hear the adventures of the crew . River-dwellers loved gossip and exciting tales , since their fields of entertainment were limited . Farrington accepted , but said that six of the crew would have to stay on the ship as guards . Frigate followed the crowd to a large roofed-over area , the Town Hall . Torches and bonfires drove back the darkness , and an orchestra played while the local variety of square-dancing began . Frisco and Tex stood around for a while , talking to the chief statesmen and their wives and close friends . Frigate , as one of the hoi polloi , was not admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the event would bet ome much less formal later on . While he was standing in line to get the free liter of pure alcohol allowed per person at such functions , he was pined by his hutmate . Eve Bellington waved at him and then got into line twelve persons IKhind him . She was tall , full figured , black haired , blue eyed , a Georgiap182peach . Born 1850 , died two days before her one hundred first birthday . Her father was a wealthy cotton planter with a distinguished record as a major in the Confederate cavalry . The Bellington plantation was burned down during Sherman 's march through Georgia , and the Bellingtons had become penniless . Her father had then gone to California and found enough gold to buy a partnership in a shipping firm . Eve had loved being wealthy again , but she still had not forgiven him for leaving her mother and herself to struggle through the occupation and the early years of Reconstruction . During her father 's absence , Eve and her mother had lived with her father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eve . He had raped her ( without too much resistance , Eve admitted ) when she was fifteen . When her mother had found that her daughter was pregnant , she had shot the uncle in the legs and the genitals . He survived a few years as a crippled eunuch in prison . Mrs. Bellington then moved to Richmond , Virginia , where her husband joined them . Eve 's son by the uncle grew up to be tall and handsome , dearly beloved by his mother . After a furious quarrel with his unclegrandfather , he left to seek his fortune in the West . A letter from Silver City , Colorado , was the last Eve ever heard from him . He 'd disappeared somewhere in the Rockies , according to a report sent by a detective . Her mother had died in a fire , and her father had died of a heart attack while trying to rescue her mother . Eve 's first husband died of cholera shortly thereafter , and before she was fifty she had lost two more husbands and six of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a novel on which Margaret Mitchell and Tennessee Williams might have collaborated . She did n't think it was very funny when Peter had told her that . After thirty-plus years on The Riverworld , Eve had gotten over her prejudice against niggers and her hatred of bluebellies . She had even fallen in love with a Yankee . Peter had never told her that his greatgrandfatherhad been with an Indiana regiment on that " infamous " march with Sherman . He had n't wanted to strain her affection . Peter moved on up the line and received the alcohol in his soapstone mug . He mixed one part of alcohol with three parts of water in a bamboo bucket and walked back to talk to Eve , who was still in line . He asked her where she had been all day . She replied that she had been wandering around , thinking . He did n't ask her what her thoughts had been . He knew . She was trying to think of a way to break off their relationship without pain.  |p183They  'd been drifting apart for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter had done some thinking on this subject himself . But each was waiting for the other to take the initiative . Peter said he would see her later , and he pushed through the noisy crowd toward Farrington . Rider was on the dance floor , whooping and whirling with Bullitt 's woman . Peter waited until the captain was through telling about his adventures in the 1899 Yukon gold rush . Farrington 's tale , which involved losing some of his teeth from scurvy , somehow became a hilarious experience . Peter said , " Mr. Farrington , have you made up your mind yet ? " Farrington paused , his mouth open to launch on another story . His reddened eyes blinked . He said , " Oh , yes ! You 're ... ah ... urn ... named Frigate , right ? Peter Frigate . The one who 's read a lot . Yes , Torn and I 've made up our minds . We 'll announce our choice some time during the party . " " I hope it 's me , " Peter said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Enthusiasm counts for a great deal , " Farrington said . " Experiencecounts for even more . Put the two together , and you have a fine jack-tar . " Peter breathed deeply and took the plunge . " This uncertainty is getting me down . Could you at least tell me if I 've been eliminated ? If I have been , I can drown my sorrow . " Farrington smiled . " It really means that much to you ? Why ? " " Well , I do want to get to the end of The River . " Farrington cocked his eyebrows . " Yeah ? Do you expect to find the answers to all your questions there ? " " I do n't want millions , I want answers to my questions , " Peter said . " That 's a quotation from a character in Dostoyevsky 's Brothers Karamazov . " Farrington 's face lit up . " That 's great ! I 'd heard of Dostoyevsky but I never had a chance to read him . I do n't think there was an English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I never ran across any . " " Nietzsche admitted that he 'd learned a lot about psychology just from reading the Russian 's novels , " Peter said . " Nietzsche , heh ? You know him well ? " " I 've read him in both English and German . He was a great poet , the only German philosopher who could write in anything but waterlogged prose . Well , that 's not fair , Schopenhauer could write stuff that would n't put you to sleep or give you a nervous breakdown while you were waiting for the sentence to end . I do n't go along with Nietzsche 's conception of the Ubermensch , though . Man is a rope across an abyss between animal andp184superman . That may not be the exact quotation ; it 's been a hell of a long time since I read Thus Spake Zarathustra . " Anyway , I do believe that man is a rope between animal and superman . But the superman I 'm thinking of is n't Nietzsche 's . The real superhuman , man or woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudices , neuroses , and psychoses , who realizes his full potential as a human being , who acts naturally on the basis of gentleness , compassion , and love , who thinks for himself and refuses to follow the herd . That 's the genuine dyed-in-the-wool superman . " Now , you take the Nietzschean concept of the superman as embodied in Jack London 's novel The Sea Wolf " Peter paused , then said , " Have you read it ? " Farrington grinned . " Many times . What about Wolf Larsen ? " " I think he was more London 's superman than Nietzsche 's . He was London 's idea of what the superman ought to be . Nietzsche would have been appalled by Larsen 's brutality . However , London did kill him off with a brain tumor . And I suppose that London meant to show by this that there was something inherently rotten about Larsen as superman . Maybe he meant to tell the reader that . If he did , it went over the heads of most of the literary critics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . Then , too , I think London was also showing that man , even superman , has his roots in his animal nature . He 's part of Nature , and no matter what his mental attainments , no matter how much he defies Nature , he ca n't escape the physical facts . He is an animal , and so he 's subject to disease , such as brain tumors . How are the mighty fallen . " But I think that Wolf Larsen was also , in some respects , what Jack London would have liked to be . London lived in a brutal world , and he thought that he had to be a superbrute to survive . Yet , London had empathy ; he knew what it was to be one of the people of the abyss . He thought that the masses could find relief from their sufferings , and realize their human potential , through socialism . He fought for it all his life . At the same time , he was a strong individualist . This conflicted with his socialism , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was n't any Emma Goldman . " In fact , his daughter Joan criticized him for that in her study of his life . " " I did n't know that , " Farrington said . " She must have written it after I died . Did you know much about her , what happened to her after London died , how she died ? " " I knew a London scholar who knew her well , " Peter said.  |p185Actually  , the scholar had only corresponded with her a little and had met her briefly . Peter did n't mind exaggerating if it would get him a berth on the ship . " She was a very active Socialist . She died in 1971 , I think . Her book about her father was very objective , especially considering that he had divorced her mother for a younger woman . " Anyway , I think that London wanted to be a Wolf Larsen because that would have made him insensitive to . the world 's woes . A man who does n't feel for others ca n't be hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Actually , he 's hurting himself . " London may have realized this and was , in fact , trying to put this idea across . At the same time , he wished to be a Larsen , even if this meant being frozen inside , that is , a superbrute . But writers have countercurrents in their psychic sea , as all humans do . That 's why , when the critics have done with them , great writers are still enigmas . When skies are hanged and oceans drowned , the single secret will still be man . " " I like that ! " Farrington cried . " Who wrote that ? " " e.e . cummings . Another line of his that 's a favorite of mine is : Listen ! There 's a hell of a good universe next door ... Let 's go ! " Peter thought that he might be pouring it on too thick . Farrington , however , seemed to be enjoying it . Once Frigate was on the ship , he could bring up subjects which might anger and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of Nietzsche had been gotten mostly from dialogs with a friend , Strawn-Hamilton . He had apparently made some attempt to read the philosopher in English . But he had been so taken by the poetic phrases and the slogans that he had not taken in the full philosophy . He had picked what he liked from Nietzsche and ignored the rest  --  as Hitler had done . Not that Farrington was any Hitler . What was it his daughter had said ? " The glad perishers , ' the Superman , " live dangerously !  --  these were more potent than wine . ' " As for Farrington 's knowledge of socialism , he had not read anything of Marx 's except The Communist Manifesto . But , as his daughter had said , ignoring Marx was a common practice among American Socialists then . There were many other things to discuss  --  and contemn . London had wanted socialism only for the benefit of the Germanic peoples . He firmly believed that men were superior to women . Might made right . And he was not , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wrote only for money , and if he had enough money would have quit writing . At least he had claimed he would . Frigate doubted this . Once a writer , always a writer.  | " Well , " Peter said , " whatever else can be said against London , Fred Lewis Patton probably had the final word . He said it was easy to criticize him , easy to deplore him , but impossible to avoid him . " Farrington liked that even more . But he said , " Enough of London , though I would like to meet him some day . Listen . Your idea of the superman sounds a lot like the ideal man of the Church of the Second Chance . It sounds even more like that of one of my crew , you know , the little Arab , though he is n't really an Arab . He 's a Spanish Moor , born in the twelfth century A.D. He 's not a Chancer , though . " He pointed to a man Frigate had seen among the crew of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a circle of Ruritanians , holding a drink and a cigarette . His speech seemed to be amusing ; at least those around him were laughing . He was about 163 centimeters or a little less than 5 feet 5 inches tall , thin but with a suggestion of wiry strength , very dark , and big nosed . He looked like a young Jimmy Durante . " Nur-ed-din el-Musafir , " Farrington said . " Nur for short . " Frigate said , " In Arabic that means Light-of-the-Faith the-Traveler . " " You know Arabic ? " Farrington said . " I never could get the hang of any foreign language except Esperanto . " " I picked up a lot of words from Burton 's Arabian Nights . " He paused . " Well , what about it ? Am I eliminated ? " Farrington said , " Yes and no . " He laughed at Frigate 's puzzled expression , and he clapped him on the shoulder . " Can you keep your mouth shut ? " " Like a Trappist monk . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had picked out that big Kanaka there . " He pointed at Maui , a giant Marquesan , looking very Polynesian in a white cloth around his waist and a big dark-red bloom in his thick , black , curly hair . " He was top's'l man in a whaler and then a harpooner for thirty years . He looks like he 'd be a hellcat in a fight . Tom and I agreed that he was easily the best qualified . But he does n't know anything about books , and I need educated people around me . That may sound snobbish , but so what ? " I 'll tell you now . I just changed my mind . You 're signed up  --  as far as I 'm concerned . No , wait a minute ! Do n't look so happy . I have to talk to Tom about this . You wait . I 'll be right back . " He plunged among the dancers , caught Rider by the hand , and dragged him off protesting to one side . Peter watched them talking . Rider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be arguing . Peter was glad that he had not had to play his trump card . If he had n't been chosen , he would have told the two that he knew their truep187identities . What would have happened then , he could n't guess . The two had some good reason to go under fake names . Perhaps they would have rushed off , leaving him behind if he had threatened to expose them . Or perhaps they would have taken him along , just to keep his mouth shut , and then thrown him overboard far up The River . Possibly Farrington had caught on to what he was doing . He must have wondered why a man so familiar with London 's works would not recognize him . He would know that Frigate would have seen photographs of him . In which case , Farrington would have decided that Frigate was playing some kind of game . He would go along with it until they were well up The River and then find out just what he was up to . However , Peter did not think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farrington nor Rider were murderers . Still , if some changed for the better on this world , others changed for the worse . And he had no idea how deep and desperate this game was . Rider came over , shook his hand , and told him he was welcome aboard . A few minutes later , Farrington stopped the music and announced his choice of the new deckhand . By then , Peter had taken Eve outside and given her the news . Eve was quiet for a while . Then she said , " Yes , I knew you were trying to get on that ship . It 's not easy to keep a secret here , Peter . I do feel bad , though mostly because you had n't told me you were going to go away . " " I tried to get hold of you , " he said . " But you had gone off without telling me where . " Eve began to cry . Peter 's eyes were moist . But she wiped the tears , sniffled , and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete . I 'm full of sorrow because our love died . I once thought that it would last forever . I should have known better , though . " " I 'm still fond of you . " " But not fond enough , is that it ? Of course it is . I 'm not blaming you , Peter . I feel the same way . It 's just that ... I wish we could have gone on feeling like we first did . " " You 'll find someone else . At least , we did n't part with hatred . " " It would have been better that way . It 's bad enough when you love each other but ca n't get along . But to have love just die out , cold ! I ca n't stand indifference . " " You 've stood a lot more than that , " he said . " If we 'd still been in love , I would 've stayed here or I would 've tried to get them to take us both . " " And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be the best way , but it 's the only way . " He pulled her to him to kiss her , but she gave him her cheek  | " Goodbye , Peter . " " I wo n't forget you . " " A lot of good that 'll do us , " she said , and she walked away . Peter went back under the roof . People crowded around to congratulate him . He did n't feel happy . Eve had upset him , and he felt uncomfortable when he was the focus of public attention . Then Bullitt was shaking his hand . " We 'll be sorry to see you go , Frigate , " he said . " You 've been a model citizen . However , there is one thing . " He turned to the sergeant-at-arms next to him and said , " Mr. Armstrong , please confiscate Mr. Frigate 's weapons . " Peter did not protest , since he had sworn to give them up if he quit Ruritania . However , he had not given his word not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still dark , he did just that . He told himself that he had put in too much labor making the weapons to give them up . Besides , he had been wounded once in the service of this state . Ruritania owed him those weapons . He had not gotten more than a kilometer up The River when he felt like going back and surrendering the weapons . That fit of honesty lasted for a day , and then he was cured . Or he thought that he was . The recurring dream came back again . This time it progressed past the point where he was standing naked outside the house . He threw pebbles against the window of the bedroom but repeated casts failed to wake Roosevelt . He went around trying the doors and windows , and when he got to the front door , he found it unlocked . He crept in through the front room , into the small kitchen , and he took the two steps needed to get to the door opposite the bathroom . This led up a steep stairway to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a tiny bedroom . He would have to go slowly , walking on the ends of the steps . They squeaked abominably if he stepped in their middle . It was then that he saw that the doors to his parents ' bedroom and the younger children 's were open . Moonlight came in . ( Never mind that it had been dawn just as he opened the front door . This was a dream . ) By its bright light he saw that his parents ' big old-fashioned brass bed was empty . And so was his little sister 's . He looked around the corner and saw that the bunkbeds of Mungo and James , Junior were also deserted . Nor was Roosevelt in his bed . In a panic , he looked out the back window . The doghouse in the backyard was empty . Everybody , even the dog , had gone off without a word . What nameless crime had he committed ?  | " THE TRAINING BLIMP WILL BE COMPLETED WITHIN A MONTH , " FIREBRASSsaid . " Jill Gulbirra is the most experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the training . In fact , I 'm making her captain of the trainer . How about that , Jill ? If you ca n't be commander of the big ship , you will be unchallenged chief honcho of the little one . Do n't ever say I never did anything for you . " The other men offered her their congratulations , though some did so sourly . Cyrano seemed genuinely delighted , and if he had not been aware of her dislike for being touched , would doubtless have embraced her tightly and kissed her . On impulse , Jill pulled him to her and gave him a quick hug . After all , he was trying to make up for his offensive behavior on the Riverbank . Twenty minutes later , she , Firebrass , Metzing , Piscator , and ten engineers began working on the blueprints for the big airship . The specifications had been determined during three weeks of hard work , usually twelve to fourteen hours a day . Instead of drawing lines on paper , however , they made blueprints on the cathode-ray tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or alterations were erased quickly , and the computer itself double-checked the proportions . Of course , the computer had to be programmed first , and Jill participated in this . She loved this sort of work . It was creative and gave her a chance to play with mathematical relations . Nevertheless , it did cause nervous tension . To relieve this and to stay in good physical shape , Jill fenced for two hours almost every day . Sword exercise here was not what it had been on Earth . The light , supple foil was discarded for the heavier , stiffer rapier . Moreover , every point of the body was a target , requiring that the fencers wear padded garments on their legs . " We are not playing now , " Cyrano told her . " You will be learning to fence for more than just points . The time may come when you will be striving in deadly earnest to keep your opponent from running you through while you try to pierce him from front to back . " She had been an excellent fencer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that she could become a top contender in world competition if she would devote enough time to training . That had been impossible since her job required too much time away from the fencing courts . But when she had a chance to practice , she had taken it . She loved fencing ; it was in some respects a very physical form of chess , which she also loved . It was a joy to take a blade in hand again and to relearn all the longunused , but not quite forgotten , skill . It was an even greater joy to find that she could beat most of her male opponents . Though she lookedawkward , once she had gripped the handle of the rapier , she became all grace and liquid speed . There were two men she could not master . One was Radaelli , the Italian master , author of Istruzione per la scherma di Spada a di sciabola , published in 1885 . The other , the indisputable champion , was Savinien Cyrano de Bergerac . Jill was surprised at this . For one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a fine art . It was not until near the end of the eighteenth century that the art neared its apex of technique . Cyrano had died in the middle of the seventeenth century before the foil had been invented , when men fought , often to the death , with techniques somewhat primitive , if spectacular . The Italians had put together the basic structure of modern swordplay by the early seventeenth century , but not until the beginning of the nineteenth century had the techniques reached the ultimate . Thus Cyrano had established a reputation as the greatest swordsman of all times without having to compete with the more sophisticated fencers of a later age . Jill had believed that his reputation had been wildly exaggerated . After all , no one knew if the famous incident of the Porte deNesle was true or not . No one except the Frenchman himself , and he would not talk about it . However , he had learned all later refinements from Radaelli and Borsody . Within four months of starting his education , he was steadily outscoring his mentors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , at least . Though rusty at first , Jill soon gained polish and began to give him a better battle . Never once , however , did she win more than one point of the total five within the six-minute limit of a match . And he always made four points before she got one . This led her to believe that he was giving her the one point to soften the defeat . Once , after a match in which she became furious because of her frustration , she accused him of patronizing her . " Even if I were in love with you and desired very much to keep from hurting your feelings , " he said , " I would not do that ! It would bep191dishonest , and while it is said that all is fair in love and war , it is not so for me . No , you have gotten your points fairly because of your quickness and skill . " " But if we were playing for keeps , " she said , " with unblunted points , you would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He raised his mask and wiped his forehead . " True . But surely you are not thinking about challenging me to a duel ? You are still not angry with me , are you ? " " About that incident on the bank ? No . Not about that . " " About what , then , if I may be so bold to ask ? " She would say nothing then , and he would raise his eyebrows and shrug his shoulders in a completely Gallic manner . Cyrano was better than she . No matter how much she practiced , no matter how hard her determination to best him , because he was a man , because she did not like to lose to anybody , male or female , she always lost . Once , when she had jeered at his ignorance and superstitions and so had made him furious ( she had done it on purpose ) , he had attacked her with such vigor that he had touched her five times in one and a half minutes . Instead of losing his head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moving with certitude and swiftness , doing everything exactly right , one hundred percent anticipatory of her every movement . It was she who was humiliated . Rightfully so , she told herself , and she apologized , though it was a double humiliation to do so . " I was terribly wrong to sneer at your lack of knowledge of science and at your mistaken beliefs , " she said . " It is not your fault that you were born in 1619 , and I should not have taunted you with that . I did so just to make you so mad I 'd get an edge on you . It was a rotten thing to do . I promise not to do it again , and I most abjectly beg your pardon . I did not really mean it . " " Then you said those nasty vicious things merely as a trick ? " he said . " A verbal device to gain points ? There was nothing personal in those socuttingremarks ? " She hesitated a moment , then said , " I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose your head . But I was not so cool myself . At the moment , I did feel that you were an ignorant simpleton , a living fossil . But that was my own anger speaking out in me . " Actually , you were far ahead of your time . You rejected the superstitionsand the barbarisms of your time , as far as anybody is able to reject his culture . You were an exceptional man , and I honor you for being that . And you 'll never hear such words from me again . "  |p192She  hesitated again , then said , " But is it true that you repented on your deathbed ? " The Frenchman 's face became red . He grimaced and said , " But yes , Ms. Gulbirra , I did indeed say that I was sorry for my blasphemies and my unbelief and I asked the good God for His pardon . I , who had been a violent atheist since the age of thirteen ! I , who hated the fat , smug , oily , stinking , ignorant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cruel God ! " But you do not know , you who lived in a freer and more permissive age , you do not know the horrors of hellfire , of eternal damnation ! You can not know what it was to have the fear of hell soaking you , drowning you ! It was taught us from earliest childhood , ground into our flesh , our bones , our deepest mind ! " And so , when I knew for sure that I was dying from a combination of that filthy disease with the lovely bucolic name of syphilis and a blow on the head from that beam , fallen accidentally or dropped by an enemy of mine , and I who only wanted to love all of mankind , and womankind , too ... where was I ? " Ah , yes , knowing for sure that I was to die , and with the terrors of the devils and of eternal tortures swarming around me , I gave in to my sister , the toothless bitch and withered nun , and my good , too good friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I repent , I will save my soul , and you may rejoice , dear sister , dear friend , I will probably go to purgatory , but you will pray me out of it , wo n't you ? " Why not ? I was frightened as I had never been in all my life , and yet , and yet , I did not wholly believe that I was destined for damnation . I had some reservations , believe me . But then , it could not hurt to repent . If Christ was indeed available for salvation , not costing a centime , mind you , and there was a heaven and a hell , then I would be a fool not to save my worthless skin and invaluable soul . " On the other hand , if all was emptiness , nothingness , once one had died , what had I to lose ? I would make my sister and that superstitious but kind-hearted Le Bret happy . " " He wrote a glowing panegyric of you after you died , " she said . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he edited two years after you died . " " Ah ! I hope he did not make me out to be a saint ! " Cyrano cried . " No , but he did give you a fine character , a noble if not quite saintly one . However , other writers ... well , you must have had many enemies . " " Who attempted to blacken my name and reputation after I was dead and could n't defend myself , the cowards , the pigs ! "  | " I do n't remember , " she said . " And it does n't actually matter now , does it ? Besides , only scholars know the names of your detractors . Unfortunately , most people only know you as the romantic , bombastic , witty , pathetic , somewhat Don-Quixotish hero of a play by a Frenchman written in the late nineteenth century . " There was a belief for a long time that you were insane by the time you had written The Voyage to the Moon and The Voyage to the Sun . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the churchly Grundies had slashed your texts , much of it made no sense . But the text was eventually restored as much as possible , and by the time I was born , an unexpurgated text had been published in English . " " I am happy to hear that ! I knew from what Clemens and others said that I had become a literary Olympian , if not a Zeus at least a Ganymede , a cupbearer in the ranks of the exalted . But your sneering remark that I was superstitious hurt me very much , mademoiselle . It is true , as you observed , that I believed that the waning moon did suck up the marrow from the bones of animals . Now you say that that is sheer rot . Very well , I accept that . And I was wrong , along with millions of others of my time and God knows how many before my time . " But this was a minuscule , a harmless error . What did it matter , what injury did it do to anyone , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that really harmed people , many millions of human beings , I assure you , was the stupid , barbarous belief in sorcery , in the ability of human beings to wreak evil through spells , chants , black cats , and the enlistment of devils as allies . I wrote a letter against that ignorant and vicious belief , that social system , rather . I contended that the grotesque legal sentences and the savagely cruel tortures and executions inflicted upon insane or innocent people in the name of God and the battle against Evil were themselves the essence of evil . " Now , it is true that this letter I speak of , Against Sorcerers , was not published while I was alive . With good reason . I would have been tortured and burned alive . It was , however , circulated among my friends . It did show that I was not as ignorant or as blackly superstitious as you made me out to be . I was ahead of my time in many respects , though I was not , of course , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know this , " she said . " And I apologized once . Would you have me do it again ? " " It is not necessary , " he said . His broad smile made him look handsome , or at least attractive , despite his large nose . Jill picked up her grail by its handle and said , " Just about dinnertime . " Jill knew something about the man called Odysseus , having heardp194occasional references . He had appeared without notice , seemingly from nowhere , when Clemens ' and King John 's forces were battling invaders who wanted to seize the meteorite ore . He had killed the enemy leader with a well-placed arrow , worked havoc among the other officers , and so had given the defenders the advantage they needed for victory . Odysseus of Ithaca claimed to be the historical Odysseus on whom Homer 's mythical character was based . He was one of the host who had fought before the walls of Troy , though he stated that the real Troy was not where the scholars said it was . Its location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia Minor . Jill , first hearing about this , had not known whether to believe that the man was truly Odysseus or not . There were so many impostors on the Riverworld . But there was one thing that made her think that he might actually be the historical Ithacan . Why should he say that Troy VIIa , which even the archaeologists and Hellenists of her day had said was the true Ilion , was not the genuine site ? Why would he claim that the historical Troy was some place else ? Whatever the reason , he was no longer around . He had disappeared as mysteriously as he had appeared . Agents sent to track him down had failed . Firebrass had continued to search for him after Clemens left on the Mark Twain . One of the searchers , Jim Sorley , had finally found some trace of the Greek , though it showed only that he had not been murdered by John 's men . Jill had wondered several times why Odysseus had volunteered to fight for Clemens ' side . Why would a stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force and risk his life for it ? What had he to gain , especially since it seemed that he had known none of the participantson either force ? She had once asked Firebrass about this , and he had said that he just did not know . Sam Clemens might be able to enlighten her , but he had never volunteered a word on the subject . Firebrass had added , " However , Odysseus may have been here for the same reason that Cyrano and I were . We wanted to get on the paddlewheeler so we could get to the polar sea . " She thought it was strange that no one had thought of building a dirigible until shortly before the second riverboat was completed . Why take decades traveling to the arctic region on a surface vessel when an airship could get there in a few days ? Firebrass said , grinning , " Just one of those mysteries of life . Man , pardon me , humanity , sometimes ca n't see the nose on his own face . Then somebody comes along and holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mankind had a nose like mine , " Cyrano said , " he would never have that trouble . " In this case the person with the mirror had been August von Parseval . On Earth he had been a major in the German Army , and he had also designed airships for a German company . His type of dirigible was used by both the German and the British governments between 1906 and 1914 . Shortly before the Mark Twain was ready to leave Parolando , von Parseval had come along . He was amazed that no one had suggested that a Luflschiff would be a faster means of transportation than a boat . After Firebrass had mentally kicked himself for this oversight , he had hastened to Clemens , taking the German with him . Surprisingly , Clemens said that he had long ago considered building a dirigible . After all , had he not written Tom Sawyer Abroad ? Had not Tom , Jim , and Huckleberry traveled from Missouri to the Sahara in a balloon ? Amazed , Firebrass asked him why he had not mentioned this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drop all the work on the boat faster than a burglar drops his tools when he sees a policeman ! He 'd want to abandon the Riverboat and put all work and materials into a flying machine ! " No , siree ! This boat takes precedence over everything else , as Noah said when his wife wanted to knock off work to go to a rain dance . " By the blazing balls of the Bull of Bashan , there 'll be no dirigible ! It 's a chancy thing , a dangerous device . Why , I would n't even be allowed to smoke a cigar on it , and if I ca n't do that , what 's the use of living ? " Clemens gave additional objections , most of them more serious . Firebrass , however , perceived that Clemens was not going to voice his main reason . Getting to the tower was not genuinely important to Clemens . It was the voyage itself that mattered to him . To build the greatest Riverboat that had ever been built , to be its captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the splendid vessel , to be admired and adored and wondered at by billions , that was what Sam Clemens desired . Moreover , he wanted revenge . He wanted to track and then to catch up with and destroy King John for having robbed him of his first boat , his first love , the Not For Hire . It might take forty years to get from Parolando to the mountains that ringed the polar sea . Sam did not care . Not only would he be the revered owner and operator of the biggest and most beautiful Riverboat mankind had ever seen , he would be going on the longest voyage any vessel , bar none , had ever taken . Forty years ! Put that in your pipe , Columbus , Magellan , and smoke it !  |p196Also  , he would be seeing and talking to hundreds of thousands . This delighted Sam , who was as curious about human beings as a housewife was about new neighbors . If he went in an airship he would have no strangers to talk to . Though Firebrass was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not understand this attitude . He himself was too eager to solve the mystery of the tower . The key to all that puzzled humanity might be there . He did not point out to Clemens what he believed to be his real reason for his objections to the airship . It would do no good . Sam- would look him straight in the eye and deny everything . However , Sam did know that he was in the wrong . And so , sixty days before the Mark Twain was to depart , he called Firebrass in . " After I leave , you can build your highly inflammable folly , if you insist on it . Of course , that means you 'll have to resign as chief engineer of the most magnificent creation of man . But you must use the dirigible for observation only , as a scout . " " Why ? " " Now how by the brass balls of burning Baal could it be used for anything else but that ? It ca n't land on the tower or anyplace else , can it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there 's no beach . And ... " " How would Joe know there 's no beach ? The sea was covered by fog . All he saw was the upper part of the tower . " Sam had puffed smoke that looked like angry dragons . " It stands to reason the people that made that sea would n't make a beach . Would they make a place from which invaders could launch a boat ? Of course not . " Anyway , what I want you to do is to find out the lay of the land . See if there 's a passage through the mountains other than what Joe described . Find out if the tower can be entered otherwise than by the roof . " Firebrass had not argued . He would do what he wished to do when he got to the pole . Clemens would have no control of him then . " I took off then , happy as a dog that 's rid of his fleas . I told von Parseval about Sam 's decision , and we had a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallowed by a dragonfish . I barely missed going down its gullet with him . " At this point in his story , Firebrass revealed a secret to Jill . " You must swear by your honor not to tell anyone else . I would n't be telling you , except that the boat is long gone , and there 's no way you could get the information to King John . Not that you would , of course . " " I promise to keep it to myself  --  whatever it is. "  | " Well ... one of our engineers was a Californian scientist . He knew how to make a laser with a range of 404 meters . Within that distance , it could slice the Rex in two . And we had just enough materials to make one . So Sam had it done . " It was a highly secret project , so secret that there are only six men on the Mark Twain who know of its existence . The laser is concealed in a compartment known only to these six , of whom Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe , does n't know about it . " When the Mark Twain catches up with the Rex , the laser will be brought out and mounted on a tripod . The battle ought to be short and sweet . Sweet for Sam , bitterly short for John . It 'll also cut down the casualties tremendously for both sides . " I was in on the secret because I was one of the engineers on the project . Before it was completed , I asked Sam if it could be left behind . I wanted to take it on the airship and use it to burn an entrance into the tower if we could not get in otherwise . " But Sam flat out refused . He said that if anything happened to the airship , the laser would be lost . I would n't be able to return it to the Mark Twain . I argued like mad , but I lost . And Sam did have a strong point . There 's no way of knowing what dangers we 'll run into , meteorological or otherwise . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABOUT TO ASK HIM IF HE HAD NOT SENT SCOUTS OUT TO LOOK FORmaterials to make another laser . At that moment Firebrass ' secretary knocked at the door . Would Mr. Firebrass see Piscator ? Firebrass said he would . The Japanese entered and , after inquiring about their health , said that he had good news . The engineers making the synthetic diesel-oil fuel would be able to deliver the first supply a week ahead of time . " ' That 's great ! " Firebrass said . He grinned at Jill . " That means you can take the Minerva up tomorrow ! Start the training seven days ahead of schedule ! Fabulous ! "  |p198Jill  felt even happier . Firebrass proposed a drink to celebrate . The skull-bloom had no sooner been poured , however , than the secretary entered again . Smiling broadly , she said , " I would n't interrupt if it were n't so important . I think we 've got a new airshipman for you , one with much experience . He just got here a few minutes ago . " Jill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ruptured cell . Her chest seemed to be caving in on her . So far , she had seemed to have the post of first mate secured . But here was a person who might have as much , or even more , experience than she . A male , of course . He might even be an officer of the Graf Zeppelin or the Hindenburg . A veteran of the large rigid dirigibles would have more clout , in Firebrass ' estimation , than one with only blimp experience . Her heart beating hard , she looked at the man who followed the secretary into the office . She did not recognize him , but that meant little . There were scores of airship personnel of her day and of the pre-Hindenburg era whose photographs she had not seen . Besides , those pictures had been of middle-aged men who wore civilian clothes or uniforms . And many of them had facial hair . " Chief Firebrass , " Agatha Rennick said . " Barry Thorn . " The newcomer wore fish-skin sandals , a bright red- , white- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the throat . The handle of his grail was in one hand and the neck of a large fish-skin bag in the other . He stood about 1.7 meter tall , and his shoulders seemed to be almost half that wide . His physique was massive , irresistibly evoking in Jill the image of a bull . Yet his legs , though thickly muscled , were long in proportion to his trunk . His chest and arms were gorillalike , but he had almost no pectoral hair . Short , curly yellow hair framed a broad face . The eyebrows were straw colored ; the eyes , a dark blue . His nose was long and straight . The lips were full . Smiling , he revealed very white teeth . The jaw was thick , ending in a prominent rounded , deeply cleft chin . The ears were small and close to his head . At Firebrass ' invitation he put down the grail and bag . He flexed his fingers as if they had been carrying a load for a long time . Probably , though , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite the broadness of his hands , the fingers were long and slim . He seemed very much at ease despite being with strangers and facing an interview on his qualifications . In fact , he radiated a well-being and ap199magnetism that inevitably made Jill think of that much overused and often inappropriate word " charisma . " Later , she would find that he had a curious gift of being able to shut , that off as if it were light from a lamp . Then , despite his obvious physical qualities , he seemed almost to become one with his background . A psychic chameleon . Jill , glancing at Piscator , saw that he was intensely curious about the stranger . His black eyes were narrowed , and his head was cocked slightly to one side , as if he were listening to some soft , faraway sound . Firebrass shook hands with Thorn . " Wow ! What a grip ! Glad to have you aboard , sir , if you are what Agatha claims you are . Sit down , take a load off your feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Forty thousand stones ? Would you care for food ? Coffee ? Tea ? Booze or beer ? " Thorn declined everything except the chair . He spoke in a very pleasant baritone without the usual pauses , hesitations , and incomplete phrases that distinguished the speech of most people . Finding that Thorn was a Canadian , Firebrass switched from Esperanto to English . In a few minutes of questioning , he got a capsule biography of the newcomer . Barry Thorn was born in 1920 on his parents ' farm outside Regina , Saskatchewan . After getting a degree in electromechanical engineering in 1938 , he enlisted in the British Navy while in England . During the war , he was the commander of a naval blimp . He married an American girl and after the war went to the States to live because his wife , an Ohioan who wanted to be close to her parents , had insisted . Besides , the opportunities were better there for blimp pilots . He picked up a commercial pilot 's license also , intending to work for the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a bush pilot for several years in the Yukon . Then he had returned to Goodyear and married again . After his second wife died , he had gotten a job with a newly formed British-West German airship company . For some years he had captained a great blimp-tug which towed floating containers of natural gas from the Middle East to Europe . Jill asked him a few questions in the hope that his answers would jog her memory . She had known a few airshipmen at Thorn 's company , and some of these might have mentioned him . He replied that he remembered one of them  --  he thought . He was n't sure because that had been so long ago. lie had died in 1983 while on leave in Friedrichshafen . He did notp200know the cause of his death . Heart failure , probably . He had gone to sleep one night and when he had awakened he was lying naked on a bank of The River  --  along with everybody else . Since then he had been wandering up and down the Valley . One day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built down-River , he had decided to find out for himself if the tale was true . Firebrass , beaming , said , " This is luck ! You 're more than welcome , Barry . Agatha , will you make arrangements to house Mr. Thorn ? " Thorn shook hands with everybody and left . Firebrass almost danced with delight . " We 're coming along famously . " Jill said , " Does this change my situation ? " Firebrass looked surprised . " No . I said you 'd be the head instructor and captain of the Minerva . Firebrass always keeps his promises . Well , almost always . " Now , I know what you 're thinking . I made no promises about who 'll be first mate of the ParsevaL You 're a strong contender for the post , Jill . But it 's too early to decide on that . All I can say is , May the best man win . Or the best woman . ' " Piscator patted her hand . At another time , she would have resented the gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had left the office , Piscator said , " I am not certain that Thorn is telling the truth . Not all of it , anyway . His story may be true as far as it goes . But there 's something that rings falsely in his voice . He could be concealing something . " " Sometimes you frighten me , " she said . " I could be wrong about him . " Jill got the impression that he did not believe that . EACH DAY , BEFORE DAWN , THE Minerva LIFTED FOR A TRAINING FLIGHT . Sometimes it stayed aloft until an hour after noon . Sometimes it cruised all day , landing at evening . For the first week , Jill was its only pilot . Then she let each of the trainee pilots and the control gondola officers handle the controls.  |p201Barry  Thorn did not enter the blimp until four weeks after aerial training started . Jill insisted that he attend ground school first . Though he was experienced , he had not been in an airship for thirty-two years and it could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object . She watched him closely while he was in the pilot 's seat . Whatever Piscator 's suspicions of him , Thorn handled the ship as if he had been doing it steadily for years . Nor was he any less competent at navigation or at dealing with the simulated emergencies which were part of the training . Jill felt disappointed . She had hoped that he was not all he claimed to be . Now she knew that he was the stuff from which captains could be made . Thorn was , however , a strange man . He seemed at ease with everybody and he could appreciate a joke as much as anybody . Yet he never cracked one himself , and off duty he kept to himself . Though he was given a hut only 20 meters from Jill 's , he never dropped in on her or invited her to visit him . In a way , this was a relief to Jill , since she did not have to worry about advances from him . Inasmuch as he made no effort to get a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homosexual . But he also did not seem interested , sexually or otherwise , in either gender . He was a loner , though , when he wished , he could open up and be very charming . Then suddenly his personality would close like a fist , and he became pale neutral , almost a living statue . The entire potential crew of the Parseval was under intense surveillance . Lich had to undergo psychological tests for stability . Thorn passed both the observation and the tests as if he had made them up himself . " Just because he 's a little odd in his social life does n't mean he is n't a first-class aeronaut , " Firebrass said . " It 's what a man does when he 's aloft that counts . " Firebrass and de Bergerac proved to be natural dirigible pilots . This was not surprising in the American 's case , since he had many thousands of hours in jetplanes , helicopters , and spacecraft . The Frenchman , however , came from a time when not even balloons had existed , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had handled then were matchlock , wheel-lock , and flintlock pistols . He had been too poor to afford a watch , which , in any case , required the owner only to Wind it . Nevertheless , he quickly absorbed the instruction in ground school and aerial flight , nor did he have much trouble with the necessary mathemat-icsFirebrass was very good , but de Bergerac was the best pilot of all . Jillp202reluctantly admitted that to herself . The Frenchman 's reactions and judgment were almost computer-swift . Another surprising candidate was John de Greystock . This medieval baron had volunteered to be part of the crew that would man the semirigid Minerva when it attacked the Rex . Jill had been skeptical about his ability to adapt to aerial flight . But , after three months of flight , he was considered by both Firebrass and Gulbirra to be the best qualified to command the ship . He was combatwise , ruthless , and utterly courageous . And he hated King John . Having been wounded and thrown overboard by John 's men when the Not For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to Parolando near the end of the month called Dektria ( Thirteenth in English ) . Parolando had adopted a thirteen-month calendarsince this planet had neither season nor moon . There was no reason except sentiment to keep the year at 365 days , but sentiment was good enough . Each month was made of four seven-day weeks , twenty-eight days in all . Since twelve months only made 336 days , an extra month had been added . This left one day extra , which was generally termed New Year 's Eve Day , Last Day , or Blow-Your-Top Day . Jill had landed three days before this in 31 A.R.D.Now it was January of 33 A.R.D. , and though work on the big airship had started , it would be almost another year before it was ready for the polar flight . This was partly due to the inevitable unforeseen difficulties and partly due to Firebrass ' grandiose ideas . These had caused many revisions of the original plans . As of now , the crew had been chosen , but the appointment of the officers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the list was fairly definite  --  except for the posts of first and second mate . One would go to Thorn and the other to herself . This had not caused her much anxiety  --  except in her dreams  --  since Thorn did not seem to care which position he got . On this Wednesday of January or First-Month , she was happy . The work on the Parseval was going so well that she decided to quit early . She 'd get her fishing pole and cast for some of the " chub " in the little lake near her hut . As she climbed the first of the hills , she saw Piscator . He was also carrying fishing tackle and a wickerwork basket . She called to him , and he turned but did not give her his usual smile in greeting . " You look as if you 've got something on your mind , " she said . " I do , but it is not my problem , except that it concerns one whom I like to think is my friend . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " I think I do . It concerns you . " She stopped . " What 's the matter ? " " I just learned from Firebrass that the psychological evaluation tests were not finished . There is one more to go , and every one of the flight crew will have to take it . " " Is that something I should worry about ? " He nodded . " The test involves deep hypnosis . It 's designed to probe for any residue of instability which previous tests might have overlooked . " " Yes , but I ... " She paused again . " I 'm afraid that it might disclose these ... ah ... hallucinations that have disturbed you from time to time . " She felt faint . For a moment , the world around her seemed to dim . Piscator held her elbow and her arm to support her . " I am sorry , but I thought it best that you be prepared . " She pulled away , saying , " I 'm all right . " Then , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight months ! I 've had no dreamgun since that time you found me in the hut , and I 'm sure that any residual effects are gone . Furthermore , I 've never had those hallucinations except late at night when I was home . You do n't really think that Firebrass would eliminate me , do you ? He does n't have enough reason to do so ! " " I do n't know , " Piscator said . " Perhaps the hypnosis might not uncover these attacks . In any event , if you will forgive me for trying to influence you , I think that you should go to Firebrass and tell him about your troubles . Do so before the tests are made . " " What good would that do ? " " If he finds out that you have been holding back on him , he probably would discharge you immediately . But if you are candid , confess before you get official word of the test , he might listen to your side of the case . I myself do not think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But my opinion does n't count . " " I wo n't beg ! " " That would n't influence him anyway  --  except negatively . " She breathed deeply and looked around , as if there might be an escape route to another world nearby . She had been so sure , so happy only a moment ago . " Very well . There 's no use putting it off . " " That 's courageous , " he said . " And commonsensical . I wish you luck . " " See you later , " she said , and she strode off , her jaw set.  |p204Nevertheless  , by the time she had climbed the stairs to the second story , where Firebrass ' apartment was , she was breathing hard , not from poor physical condition but from anxiety . Firebrass ' secretary had told her that he had gone to his suite . She was surprised at this but did not ask Agatha why he had quit work so early . Perhaps he , too , felt like relaxing . The door to his apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodyguard that usually accompanied him . Two assassination attempts in the last six months had made this necessary . The would-be killers had been slain themselves and thus could give no information . No one knew for certain , but it was believed that a ruler of a hostile state down-River had sent the men . He had made no bones about his desire to get hold of Parolando 's mineral wealth and marvelous machines and weapons . It was possible that he had hoped that , if he removed Firebrass , he might be able to invade Parolando . But this was all speculation by Firebrass . Jill walked up to the ensign in command of four heavily armed men . " I 'd like to talk to the chief . " The ensign , Smithers said , " Sorry . He gave orders he was n't to be disturbed . " " Why not ? " Smithers looked curiously at her . " I would n't know , sir . " Anger caused by her fear overcame her . " I suppose he has a woman in there ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is any of your business , sir . " He grinned maliciously and said , " He 's got a visitor . A newcomer named Fritz Stern . He just got here an hour ago . He 's a German , and , from what I heard , a hotshot Zeppelin man . I heard him tell the captain he was a commander for NDELAG , whatever that means . But he 's got more flight time than you . " Jill had to restrain herself from hitting him in his teeth . She knew that Smithers had never liked her , and no doubt he enjoyed needling her . " NDELAG , " she said , hating herself because her voice was trembling . " That could be Neue Deutsche **33;4344;TOOLONG . " Now her voice seemed to be coming from far away , from someone else . " There was a Zeppelin line called DELAG in the days before World War I. It carried passengers and freight in Germany . But I never heard of an NDELAG . " " That would be because it was formed after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoying her obvious distress . " I did hear him tell the captain that he graduated from the Friedrichshafen academy in 1984 . He said he ended his career as commander of a super-Zeppelin named Viktoria. "  |p205She  felt sick . First Thorn and now Stern . There was no use staying here . She squared her shoulders and said , in a firm voice , " I 'll see him later . " " Yes , sir . Sorry , sir , " Smithers said , grinning . Jill turned away to go back down the stairs . She whirled around as a door banged and somebody shouted . A man had run out of Firebrass ' apartment and slammed the door behind him . He stood for several seconds , frozen , facing the guards . These were pulling their heavy pistols from their holsters . Smithers had his sword halfway from its sheath . The man was as tall as he . He had a beautiful physique , broad shouldered , slim waisted , long legged . His face was handsome but rugged ; his hair , wavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But his skin was unhealthily pale and blood was flowing from a wound on the shoulder . lie held a bloodied dagger in his left hand . Then the door opened , and Firebrass , a rapier in his hand , appeared . His face was twisted , and his forehead bled . The ensign shouted , " Stern ! " Stern whirled and ran down the hall . There was no stairway at its end , only a tall window . Smithers cried , " Do n't fire , men ! He ca n't get away ! " " He can if he goes through the window ! " Jill screamed . At the end of the hall , Stern leaped with a shout , whirling so that his hack would strike the plastic and holding an arm over his face . The window refused to give way . Stern hit it with a thud and bounced back , falling flat with another thud on his face . He lay there while Firebrass , the ensign , and the guards behind him , ran toward Stern . Jill followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , Stern got to his feet . He stared at the men racing toward him , looked at the dagger , which he had dropped on the floor when he had hit the window . Then he closed his eyes and crumpled to the floor.  |p206BY  THE TIME JILL GOT THERE , FIREBRASS WAS FEELING THE MAN 'S PULSE . " He 's dead ! " " What happened , sir ? " the ensign said . Firebrass stood up . " I wish I could say why it happened . All I can tell you is what happened . We were getting along fine , drinking and smoking , joking , and he was giving me the details of his professional career . Everything was Aokay . And then all of a sudden he leaps up , pulls a dagger , and tries to stab me ! " He must have gone crazy , although he seemed quite rational until the moment he attacked . Something went wrong in him . Otherwise , why would he drop dead of a heart attack ? " Jill said , " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a heart attack here . Have you ? " Firebrass shrugged and said , " There 's always a first time . After all , the resurrections have stopped , too . " " He looks bloody cyanotic for a heart attack , " Jill said . " Could he have swallowed a poison ? I did n't see him put anything in his mouth . " " Where would he get cyanide or prussic acid or any poison except here in Parolando ? " Firebrass said . " He has n't been here long enough to do that . " He looked at Smithers . " Wrap up the body and take it into one of my bedrooms . Take it out after midnight and drop it into The River . The dragonfish can have him . " " Yes , sir , " Smithers said . " What about that cut on your forehead , sir ? Should I get a doctor ? " " No , I 'll patch it up myself . And not a word about this to anybody . Have you got that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not a word . I do n't want to upset the citizens . " They all nodded . Smithers said , " Do you suppose that that bastard Burr sent this man , too ? "  | " I do n't know , " Firebrass said . " Or care . I just want you to get rid of him , okay ? " He turned to Jill . " What 're you doing here ? " " I had something important to talk about , " she said . " But I 'll do it later . You 're in no condition to talk . " " Nonsense ! " he said , grinning . " Sure I am . You do n't think this is going to shake me up , do you ? Come on in , Jill , and we 'll talk after I fix up this scratch . " Jill sat down in an overstuffed chair in the living room of the luxurious suite . Firebrass disappeared into the bathroom , returning after a few minutes with a white tape slanting across his forehead . Smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " What about a drink ? It might settle your nerves . " " My nerves ? " " Okay . Both our nerves . I 'll admit I 'm a little shaken up . I 'm no superman , no matter what people say about me . " He poured purplish skull-bloom into two tall glasses half-filled with ice cubes . Neither the ice nor the glasses , like the band-aid , were available anywhere but in Parolando  --  as far as she knew . For a minute they sipped on the cool , tangy drink , their eyes meeting but neither saying a word . Then Firebrass said , " Okay . Enough of the social amenities . What did you want to see me about ? " She could scarcely get the words out . They seemed to jam in her throat , then come tumbling out , broken by the pressure . After pausing to take a long drink , she continued more slowly and smoothly . Firebrass did not interrupt but sat immobile , his brown eyes , flecked with green , intent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there you are . I had to tell you about this , but it 's the hardest thing I ever did . " " Why did you finally decide to spill it ? Was it because you heard about the hypnosis ? " For a second , she thought of lying . Piscator would not betray her , and she would look so much better if she had not been forced to admit the truth . " Yes . I heard about it . But I 'd been thinking for some time that I should tell you about it . It was just ... it was just that I could n't bear the thought of being left behind . And I really do n't think I 'm a danger to the ship . " " It would be bad if you had an attack during a crucial moment of flight . You know that , of course . Well , here 's the way I look at it , Jill.  |p208Barring  Thorn , you 're the best airshipman  --  I mean , person  --  that we have . Unlike Thorn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his whole life , you 're a fanatic . I honestly think you 'd pass up a roll in the hay for an hour 's flight . Myself , I 'd try to combine both . " I would n't want to lose you , and if I had to , I 'd worry about your killing yourself . No , do n't protest , I really think you would . Which makes you unbalanced in that respect . However , I have to consider the welfare of ship and crew first , so I 'd discharge you if I had to , no matter how much it would grieve me . " So I 'm putting you on probation . If you do n't have another attack or hallucination from now until the ship takes off for the big voyage , then you 'll be in . " The only trouble with this is that I 'll have to depend on your word for it that you 've not had an attack . Well , not really . I could put you under hypnosis to find out if you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do that . It 'd mean I do n't trust you . I do n't want anybody on the ship I ca n't trust one hundred percent . " Jill felt like running over to him and throwing her arms around him . Her eyes filmed , and she almost sobbed with joy . But she stayed in her chair . An officer did not embrace the captain . Besides , he might misinterpret her behavior and try to take her into his bedroom . She felt ashamed of herself . Firebrass would never take advantage of any woman . He would scorn using his influence . At least , she thought he would . " I do n't understand about this hypnosis , " she said . " How could you make all the others go through with it but omit me ? That 's discrimination which the others ... " " I 've changed my mind about that . " He got up and walked to a. rolltop desk , bent over it to write on a piece of paper , and then gave it to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'll take an X-ray of you . " She was bewildered . " Whatever on earth for ? " " As your captain I could tell you to shut up and obey my order . I wo n't because you 'd be resentful . Let 's just say it 's something the psychologists learned in 2000 A.D. It would defeat the purpose of the test if I told you what it was all about . " Everybody else will have to be X-rayed , too . You have the honor of being the first . " " I do n't understand , " she murmured . " But I 'll do it , of course . " She rose . " Thank you . "  | " No thanks necessary . Now get your tail down to Doc Graves . " When she arrived at the doctor 's office , she found him talking on the Rhone . He was frowning and chewing his cigar savagely . " All right , Milt . I 'll do it . But I do n't like it that you wo n't confide in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " Hello , Jill . You 'll have to wait until Ensign Smithers gets here . He 'll pick up the X-ray photos as soon as they 're made and run them up to Firebrass . " " He has a darkroom ? " " No . They do n't need developing . Did n't you know ? They 're just like other photographs , electronically processed at the moment they 're taken . Firebrass himself designed the equipment . It 's a process developed about 1998 , he said . " Graves began striding back and forth , biting hard on the cigar . " Damn it ! He wo n't even let me see the X-rays ! Why ? " " He said he did n't want anyone but himself to see the X-rays . It 's part of the psychological evaluation tests . " " How in hell could X-rays of the head tell you anything about a man 's psyche ? Is he nuts ? " " I suppose he 'll tell us all about it when he 's seen all the photos . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not a man . " " I was speaking in the abstract . " He stopped and scowled even more fiercely . " I wo n't be able to sleep nights worrying about this . Man , I wish I 'd lived longer . I shuffled off this mortal coil in 1980 , so I did n't get to see the later developments in medical science . Just as well , I suppose . I could n't keep up with the deluge of new stuff as it was . " Turning to Jill , and stabbing the cigar at her , he said , " Something I 'd like to ask you , Jill . Something that 's been bothering me . Firebrass is the only one I 've ever met who lived beyond 1983 . Have you ever met anyone who did ? " She blinked with surprise . " No-o-o . No , I have n't , now I think about it . Firebrass excepted . " For a moment , she had been about to tell him about Stern . That was going to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar . " " Not really , " she said . " Of course , I have n't been all over The River , but I have traveled several hundred thousand kilometers and talked to thousands of people . The twentieth-century people seem to have been scattered thinly everywhere . If they were resurrected in clumps , as it were ,  |p210I  never heard of any . So that means that anywhere in the Valley you 'll likely find a few , but most of the population segments will be from other centuries . " So there 's nothing remarkable in the rarity of people born after 1983 . " " Yeah ? Maybe so . Ah , here comes Smithers and two other thugs . Step into my X-rated parlor , my dear , as the spider said to the fly . " 36EXTRACTS FROM VARIOUS EDITIONS OF The Daily Leak .

As all but new citizens know , he entered Parolando two months ago and was immediately signed up for training . He has an illustrious though tragic history , having been chief motor engineer on the airship Norge and then on the Italia under Umberto Nobile . ( See page 6 for a minibiography of this son of Rome . ) The Norge accomplished its primary mission to fly over the North Pole on May 12 , 1926 . It also established that there was no large land mass between the North Pole and Alaska as reported by that great explorer , Commodore Robert E. Peary ( 1856-1920 ) , the first man to reach the North Pole ( 1909 ) . ( Though Peary was accompanied by a Negro , Matthew Henson , and four Eskimos whose names we do n't remember , actuallyHenson was the first man to stand on the North Pole . ) The Italia , after passing over the Pole , found itself bucking a very strong headwind on its way to King 's Bay . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , the ice melted , and the airship proceeded . Some time later , the vessel began to fall slowly . The helpless crew was forced to stand by while the queen of the skies struck the surface ice . The control gondola was torn off , a fortuitous event for those in it . These scrambled out and then looked up in shock as the dirigible , freed of the weight of the gondola , rose again . Ettore Arduino was last seen standing on the gangway to the starboard engine gondola . Asp212reported by a crew member , Dr. Francis Behounekof the Wireless Institute of Prague , Czechoslovakia , Arduino 's face was a mask of utter disbelief . The Italia floated away , and nothing of it or the men still aboard was ever seen again . On Earth , that is .

His complete account of this horrendous experience will be printed in next Thursday 's issue . After this blood-chilling event , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel . But he is undaunted by this and expresses eagerness for another polar expedition . We do n't care what people say about Italians , and we have nothing but contempt for the attitude prevalent in Tombstone , where it was stated as a fact that all wops were yellow .

Metzing had been chief of the Naval AirshipDivision of Imperial Germany in 1913 . He was Korvettenkapitan of the Zeppelin L-1 when it went down on September 9 , 1913 , during maneuvers . This was the first naval Zeppelin to be lost . The crash was not due to any deficiency on the part of crew or vessel but to the ignorance at that time of meteorological conditions in the upper air . In other words , weather forecasting was then a primitive science . A violent line squall lifted the L-1 up past her pressure height and then dashed her down . With propellers still spinning and ballast ejecting , the ship smashed into the sea off Heligoland . Metzing died with most of his crew ... We welcome this experienced officer and likeable gentleman to Parolando but hope he brings no bad luck with him . ... Flash ! Just arrived ! Another airship veteran , Anna Karlovna Obrenova from up-River some 40,000 kilometers . In the brief interview allowed before Ms. Obrenova was taken to PresidentFirebrass ' HQ , we learned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logging 8584 hours of flight time in this and other airships . This exceeds Ms. Gulbirra 's 8342 hours and Mr. Thorn 's 8452 hours . A complete account of Obrenova should be in tomorrow 's issue . All we can say at the moment is that she is a peach , a real pipperoo !  |p214IT  WAS FUNNY , THOUGH NOT LAUGHING-FUNNY . She had been worried that a man with more airtime than herself would show up . One had , but he had not been aggressive . His only ambition was to be on the ship , and he did not seem to care what rank he got . Somehow , she had never thought of being displaced by a woman . There were so few female airship officers in her time . And so few people who had lived past 1983 had come by  --  only one , in fact  --  that she had not worried about dirigibilists of that era . From what Firebrass said , post-1983 had been the great age of the large rigid airships . But the odds against aeronauts of that era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so here was Obrenova , a woman who had 860 hours flight time as captain of a giant Soviet airship . So far , the officers ' positions had not been announced . No matter . Jill knew that the little blonde newcomer would be first mate . Realistically , she should be . If Jill were in Firebrass ' place , she would have had to appoint Obrenova as first mate . On the other hand , there were only two months left before the Parseval took off for the polar voyage . The Russian might need more retraining than that . After thirty-four years of ground life , she would be rusty . She would have a month reacquainting herself with gasbags in the Minerva . Then she would have a month of training in the big ship with everybody else . Could she do it ? Of course , she could . Jill would have been able to do it in that time . She had been in the conference room with the officer candidates when Anna Obrenova was brought in by Agatha . On seeing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sluggish motor . Before she heard Agatha 's excited announcement of the newcomer 's identity , she had known what it would be . Anna Obrenova was short and slim but long legged and full breasted . She had long , shining yellow hair and large , dark blue eyes , a heartshapedface , high cheekbones , a cupid 's bow mouth , and a deep tan . She was , to quote another newspaper article , a " beaut. "  |p215Disgustingly  delicate and feminine . Unfairly so . Just the type that men simultaneously wanted to protect and to bed . Firebrass was on his feet , advancing toward her , his face aglow , his eyes seeming to drip male hormones . But it was Thorn 's reaction that surprised Jill . On seeing Obrenova enter , he had jumped to his feet and opened his mouth , closed it , opened it , then closed it again . His ruddy skin was pale . " Do you know her ? " Jill said softly . He sat down and covered his face with his hands for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " No ! For a second I thought I did ! She looks so much like my first wife ! I still ca n't believe it . " " Thorn remained shaking in his chair while others crowded around Obrenova . Not until the others had been introduced did he get up and shake her hand . He told her then how remarkably she resembled his wife . She smiled  --  " dazzlingly " was a clich6 , but it was the only adverb appropriate  --  and she said , in heavily accented English , " Did you love your wife ? " That was a strange thing to say . Thorn stepped back a pace and said , " Yes , very much . But she left me . " " I am sorry , " Obrenova said , and they did not exchange another word while in the room . Firebrass sat her down and offered her food , cigarettes , and liquor . She accepted the former but declined the rest . " Does that mean you have no vices ? " Firebrass said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obrenova ignored this . Firebrass shrugged and began questioning her . Jill got depressed while listening to the account of her experience . She had been born in Smolensk in 1970 , had been educated as an aeronautical engineer , and in 1984 had become an airship trainee . In 2001 she had been made captain of the passenger freighter Lermontoa . Finally , Firebrass said that she must be tired . She should go with Agatha , who 'd find quarters for her . " Preferably in this building , " he said . Agatha replied that no rooms were available . She would have to be satisfied with a but near those of Ms. Gulbirra and Mr. Thorn . Firebrass , looking disappointed , said , " Well , maybe we can find a place here for her later . Meantime , I 'll go with you , Anna , and make sure you 're not given a dump . " Jill felt even lower . How could she expect objectivity from him , when he was so obviously smitten by the Russian ? For a while , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tying her up in a hidden place just before the Parseaal was to take off ? Firebrass would not hold up the flight until she was found . Jill Gulbirra would then become first mate . If she could do that to Obrenova , why not to Firebrass ? Then she would be the captain . The images evoked were pleasing , but she could not do that to anyone , no matter how strongly she felt . To violate their human rights and dignities would be to violate , to destroy herself . During the week that followed she sometimes beat her fists on the table or wept . Or both . The next week she told herself that she was being immature . Accept what was unavoidable and enjoy what was left . Was it so important that she should finally be captain of an airship ? To her , yes . To anyone else in the world , no . So she swallowed her resentment and disgust . Piscator must have known how she felt . Frequently , she caught him looking at her . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he knew ! Six months passed . Firebrass gave up trying to get Obrenova to move into his apartment . He made no secret of his desire nor did he hide the fact that she had finally rejected him . " You win some , you lose some , " he said to Jill with a wry smile . " Maybe she does n't go for men . I know a score or more who 've been panting after her , and she 's as cool to them as if she were the Venus de Milo . " " I 'm sure she is n't a lesbian , " Jill said . " Takes one to know one , heh ? Haw , haw ! " " Damn it , you know I 'm ambivalent , " she said angrily , and she walked away . " Indecisive is the right word ! " he had shouted after her . At that time Jill was living with Abel Park , a tall , muscular , handsome , and intelligent man . He was a Rivertad , one of the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of five . Abel did not remember what country he had been born in or what his native language had been . Though resurrected in an area the majority of whom were medieval Hindus , he had been adopted and raised by a Scots couple . These were eighteenth-century Lowlanders of peasant origin . Despite his poverty , the foster father had managed to become a medical doctor in Edinburgh . Abel had left his area after his parents had been killed and had wandered down-River until he came to Parolando . Jill had liked him very much and had asked him to be her hutmate . The big fellow had gladlyp217moved in , and they had had some idyllic months . But , though he was intelligent , he was ignorant . Jill taught him everything she could : history , philosophy , poetry , and even some arithmetic . He was eager to learn , but eventually he accused her of patronizing him . Shocked , Jill had denied this . " I just want to educate you , to give you knowledge denied you because you died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so impatient . You keep forgetting that I do n't have your background . Things which seem simple to you , because you were raised among them , are bewildering to me . I do n't have your referents . " He had paused , then said , " You 're a knowledge-chauvinist . In short , a ... what 's the word ? ... a snob . " Jill was even more shocked . She denied this , too , though reflection showed her that he was perhaps right . By then it was too late to make reparations . He had left her for another woman . She consoled herself by telling herself that he was too used to the idea of the man being the boss . He found it difficult to accept her as an equal . Later , she realized that that was only partly true . Actually , she had , deep down , a contempt for him because he was not , and never would be , her mental equal . That had been an unconscious attitude , and now that she was aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she felt ashamed of it . After that , she made no effort to have anything but the most impermanent liaisons . Her partners were men and women who , like her , wanted only sexual satisfaction . Usually , she and they got it , but she always felt frustrated afterward . She needed a genuine affection and companionship . Obrenova and Thorn , she observed , must be doing the same thing as she . At least , no one moved into their huts . For that matter , though , she never observed them taking any interest in anybody which could be interpreted as sexual . As far as she knew , they were not even having onenightstands . Thorn did , however , seem to like Obrenova 's company . Jill often saw them talking earnestly together . Perhaps Thorn was trying to get her to be his lover . And perhaps the Russian refused because she thought she would only be a substitute for his first wife . Three days before the final liftoff , a holiday was declared . Jill left the plains area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and clown The River . She estimated that there were already several hundred thousands camping in Parolando and that there would be over twice that number by the time the Parseaal left . She retired to her hut , leaving it Wily for a little fishing . The second day , as she was sitting on the edge ofp218the little lake , looking emptily into the water , she heard someone approaching . Her irritation at the invasion died when she saw Piscator . He was carrying a fishing pole and a wickerwork basket . Silently , he sat down beside her and offered her a cigarette . She shook her head . For some time they stared at the surface , rippled by the wind , broken now and then by a leaping fish . Finally , he said , " It wo n't be long before I must reluctantly say goodbye to my disciples and to my piscatorial pursuits . " " Is it worth it to you ? " " You mean , giving up this pleasant life for an expedition that may end in death ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' After another silence , he said , " How have you been ? Any more experiences such as that night ? " " No , I 'm fine . " " But you have been carrying a knife in your heart . " " What do you mean ? " she said , turning her head to look at him . She hoped her puzzlement did not look as faked as it felt to her . " I should have said three knives . The captaincy , the Russian , and most of all , yourself . " " Yes , I have problems . Do n't we all ? Or are you an exception ? Are you even human ? " He smiled and said , " Very much so . More than most , I can say with seeming immodesty . Why is that ? Because I have realized my human potentiality almost to its fullest . I ca n't expect you to credit that . Nor will you , unless , some day ... but that day may never come . " However , regarding your question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people we have met are human . I mean , do they belong to Homo sapiens ? " Is n't it possible , even highly probable , that the Whoevers responsible for all this have agents among us ? For what purpose , I do n't know . But they could be catalysts to cause some kind of action among us . By action , I do not mean physical action ; such as the building of the Riverboats and airships , though that may be part of it . I refer to psychic action . To a , shall we say , channeling of humanity ? Toward what ? Perhaps toward a goal somewhat similar to that which the Church of the Second Chance postulates . A spiritual goal , of refinement of the human spirit . Or perhaps , to use a Christian-Muslim metaphor , to separate the sheep from the goats . " He paused and drew on his cigarette.  | " To continue the religious metaphor , there may be two forces at work here , one for evil , one for good . One is working against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . Then , " Do you have any evidence for that ? " " No , only speculation . Do n't get me wrong . I do n't think that Shaitan , Lucifer if you will , is actually conducting a cold war against Allah , or God , whom we Sufis prefer to name The Real . But I sometimes wonder if there is n't a parallel to that in some sense ... well , it is all speculation . If there are agents , then they look like human beings . " " Do you know something I do n't ? " " I have probably observed certain things . You have , too , the difference being that you have not put them into a pattern . A rather dark pattern it is . Though it is possible that I am looking at the wrong side of the pattern . If it were turned over , the other side might be blazing with light . " " I wish I knew what you were talking about . Would you mind letting me in on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stub into the lake . A fish rose , swallowed it , and splashed back . " There are all sorts of activity going on beneath that mirror of water , " he said , pointing to the lake . " We ca n't see them because water is a different element from the air . The fish know what 's going on down there , but that does n't do us much good . All we can do is to lower our hooks into the darkness and hope we catch something . " I read a story once in which a fish sat down on the bottom of a deep , dark lake and extended his fishing pole into the air over the bank . And he caught men with his bait . " " Is that all you 're going to say about that ? " He nodded , and said , " I presume you are coming to Firebrass ' farewell party tonight . " " It 's a command invitation . But I hate going . It 'll be a drunken brawl . " " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their swinishness . Be with but not of them . That will enable you to enjoy the thought of how superior you are to them . " " You 're an ass , " she said . Then , quickly , " I 'm sorry , Piscator . I 'm the ass . You read me correctly , of course . " " I think that Firebrass is going to announce tonight the ranking of the officers and pilots . " She held her breath for a moment . " I think so , too , but I am not looking forward with pleasure to that . "  | " You prize rank too , highly . What is worse , you know it but will do nothing about it . In any event , I think you have an excellent chance . " " I hope so . " " Meanwhile , would you care to go out in the boat with me and participate in the angling ? " " No , thanks . " She rose stiffly and pulled in the line . The bait was gone off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brood a while . " " Do n't lay any eggs , " he said , grinning . Jill snorted feebly and walked away . Before she reached her hut , she passed Thorn 's . Loud , angry voices were issuing from it . Thorn 's and Obrenova 's . So , the two had finally gotten together . But they did not seem happy about it . Jill hesitated a moment , almost overcome with the desire to eavesdrop . Then she plunged on ahead , but she could not help hearing Thorn shout in a language unknown to her . So  --  it would have done her no good to listen in . But what was that language ? It certainly did not sound like Russian to her . Obrenova , in a softer voice , but still loud enough for Jill to hear her , said something in the same language . Evidently , it was a request to lower his voice . Silence followed . Jill walked away swiftly , hoping they would not look outside and think she had been doing what she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As far as she knew , Thorn could speak only English , French , German , and Esperanto . Of course , he could have picked up a score of languages during his wanderings along The River . Even the least proficient of linguists could not avoid doing that . Still , why would the two talk in anything but their native languages or in Esperanto ? Did both know a language which they used while quarrelingso that nobody would understand them ? She would mention this to Piscator . He might have an illuminating viewpoint on the matter . As it turned out , however , she had no chance to do so , and by the time the Parseual took off , she had forgotten about the matter.  |p221Discoveries  in DisJan. 26 , 20 A.R.D.Peter Jairus FrigateAboard the Razzle DazzleSouth Temperate ZoneRiverworldRobert F. Rohrig Down-River ( hopefully ) DEAR BoB : In thirteen years on this ship I 've sent out twenty-one of these missives . Letter from a Lazarus . Cable from Charon . Missive from Mictlan . Palaver in Po . Tirades from Tir na nOc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Styx . Issues from Issus . Etc . All that sophomoric alliterative jazz . Three years ago I dropped into the water my Telegram from Tartarus . I wrote just about everything significant that 'd happened to me since you died in St. Louis of too much living . Of course , you wo n't get either letter except by the wildest chance . Ilere I am today in the bright afternoon , sitting on the deck of a twomastedschooner , writing with a fishbone pen and carbonblack ink on bamboo paper . When I 'm done , I 'll roll the pages up , wrap them in fish membrane , insert them in a bamboo cylinder . I 'll hammer down a disc of bamboo into the open end . I 'll say a prayer to whatever gods there be . And I 'll toss the container over the side . May it reach you via Rivermail . The captain , Martin Farrington , the Frisco Kid , is at the tiller right now . Ilis reddish-brown hair shines in the sun and whips with the wind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's an American ofp222English and Welsh descent , born in Oakland , California in 1876 . He has n't told me that , but I know that because I know who he really is . I 've seen too many pictures of him not to recognize him . I ca n't name him because he has some reason for going under a pseudonym . ( Which , by the way , is taken from two of his fictional characters . ) Yes , he was a famous writer . Maybe you 'll be able to figure it out , though I doubt it . You once told me that you had read only one of his works , Tales of the Fish Patrol , and you thought it was lousy . I was distressed that you 'd refuse to read his major works , many of which were classics . He and his first mate , Tom Rider , " Tex , " and an Arab named Nur are the only members of the original crew left . The others dropped out for one reason or another : death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the only two people I 've met on The River who could come anywhere near being famous people . I did come close to meeting Georg Simon Ohm ( you 've heard of " ohms " ) and James Nasmyth , inventor of the steamhammer . And to and behold ! Rider and Farrington are near the top of the list of the twenty people I 'd most like to meet . It 's a peculiar list , but , being human , I 'm peculiar . The first mate 's real surname is n't Rider . His face is n't one I 'd forget , though the absence of the white ten-gallon hat makes it seem less familiar . He was the great film hero of my childhood , right up there with my book heroes : Tarzan , John Carter of Barsoom , Sherlock Holmes , Dorothy of Oz , and Odysseus . Out of the 260 western movies he made , I saw at least forty . These were second or third runs in the second-class Grand , Princess , Columbia , and Apollo theaters in Peoria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) His movies gave me some of my most golden hours . I do n't remember the details or the scenes of a single one  --  they all blur into a sort of glittering montage with Rider as a giant figure in the center . When I was about fifty-two years old , I became interested in writing biographies . You know that I had planned for many years to write a massive life of Sir Richard Francis Burton , the famous or infamous nineteenth-century explorer , author , translator , swordsman , anthropologist , etc . But financial exigencies kept me too busy to do much on A Rough Knight for the Queen . Finally , just as I was ready to start full time on Knight , Byron Farwell came out with an excellent biography of Burton . So I decided to wait a few years , until the market could take another Burton bio . And just as I was about to start again , Fawn Brodie 's life of Burton  --  probably the best  --  was published.  |p223So  I put off the project for ten years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite childhood film hero ( though I ranked Douglas Fairbanks , Senior , as my other top favorite ) . I 'd read a lot of articles about my hero in movie and western magazines and newspaper clippings . These depicted him as having led a life more adventurous and flamboyant than those of the heroes he played in films . But I still did not have the money to quit writing fiction long enough to travel around the country interviewing people who 'd known him  --  even if I could have found them . There were some who could have given me details of his careers as a Texas Ranger , a U.S. Marshal in New Mexico , a deputy sheriff in the Oklahoma Territory , a Rough Rider with Roosevelt at San Juan Hill , a soldier in the Philippine Insurrection and the Boxer Rebellion , a horse breaker for the British and possibly as a mercenary for both sides in the Boer War , as a mercenary for Madero in Mexico , as a Wild West show performer , and as the highest-paid movie actor of his time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even those who claimed to have known him well gave differing accounts of his life . His obituaries were full of contradictions . And I knew that Fox and Universal had put out a lot of publicity stories about him , most of which had to be checked out for exaggeration or downright lies . The woman who thought she was his first wife had written a biography of him . You 'd never know from it that he had divorced her and married twice thereafter . Or had two daughters by another woman . Or that he had a " drinking problem . " Or an illegitimate son who was a jeweler in London . She thought she was his first wife , but , as it turned out , she was his second or third . Nobody 's too sure about that . That he was still a flawless hero to her even after all this says much about the man , though . It says even more about her . A good friend of mine , Coryell Varoll ( you remember him , a circus acrobat , juggler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan ) wrote me about him . In 1964 , 1 think . " I remember the first time I met him I thought I was meeting God ... over the years , being on the same lot with him many times " ( in the circus , he means ) " the awe fell apart but he was always liked by most people and always idolized by the kids even after he quit making pix ... I know that sober he was a swell guy , drunk he 'd fight at the least excuse and do some of the damnedest things ( do n't we all ? ) ... I 've a few dozen stories aboutp224him that never made the publications . I 'll tell them the next time we get together . " But somehow Cory never did . Even his birthdate was in doubt . His studios and his wife claimed he was born in 1880 . The monument near Florence , Arizona ( where he died doing 80 mph on a dirt road ) , says 1880 . But there was contrary evidence that it was 1870 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked like a young fifty . He always kept himself in great shape . Also , a friend who saw him off on his fatal trip said he was driving a yellow Ford convertible . His wife said it was white . So much for eyewitnesses . The studio publicity departments claimed he was born and raised in Texas . I found out myself that that was a lie . He was born near Mix Run , Pennsylvania , and he left there when he was eighteen to enter the Army . Just as I was about to write to the War Department to get a copy of his military record  --  and find out for myself just what he had done in the Army  --  a novel by Darryl Ponicsan came out . I was stymied again ; again , too late . Though the book was semifictional , its author had done the job of research that I 'd been planning to do . So  --  my hero was n't the grandson of a Cherokee chief . Nor was he born in El Paso , Texas . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been severely wounded at San Juan Hill nor wounded in the Philippines . Actually , he 'd enlisted the day after the Spanish-American War started . I 'm sure  --  as was Ponicsan  --  that he hoped to get into action . There is no doubt that he had great courage and that he desired to be where the bullets were the thickest . Instead , he was kept at the fort , then honorably discharged . He thereupon reenlisted . But still , no action . So he deserted in 1902 . He did not go to South Africa , as the studios claimed . Instead , he married a young schoolteacher and went with her to the Oklahoma Territory . Either her father got the marriage annulled or she just left him and a divorce was never filed . Nobody 's sure . While working as a bartender , shortly before he went to work for the 101 Ranch in Oklahoma , he married another woman . This did n't work out , and he apparently failed to divorce her , too . Most of what the studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These tales were made up to glamorize a man who did not need it . Rider went along with these tales , maybe made up some himself for the studios . After a while he got to believing them himself . I mean , really believing them . I should know . I 've heard him relate almostp225all of the prevarications , and it 's evident that by now the fiction is as genuine as the reality to him . This blurring of distinction between reality and fantasy in no way interferes with his competency in real life , of course . He did , however , reject Fox 's wish to advertise him as the illegitimate son of Buffalo Bill . That might have started inquiries which would have exposed the whole truth . And he never says a word about having been a great movie star . He does tell stories about his film experiences , but in these he 's always an extra . Why is he using a pseudonym ? I do n't know . His third wife described him as tall , slender , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been considered a tall man , though he 's shorter than I am . His slim body does contain steelwire muscles . Farrington is shorter than he but very muscular . He 's always after Tom to Indian wrestle him , especially when he ( Farrington ) has been drinking . Tom obliges . They put an elbow on the table , lock raised hands , and then try to force each other 's hand down to the table . It 's a long struggle , butW Tom usually wins . Farrington laughs , but I think he 's really chagrined . I 've wrestled with both of them , coming out about fifty percent winner ( or loser ) . I can beat both of them in the dashes and the long jump . But when it comes to boxing or stick fighting , I usually get licked . I do n't have their " killer instinct . " Besides , this macho thing never was important to me . Though that may be because I suppressed it from some unconsciousfear of competition . It 's important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows it . Anyway , it was a thrill to be with these two . It still is , though familiarity breeds , if not contempt , familiarity . Tom Rider has been up and down The River for hundreds of thousands of kilometers and has three times been killed . Once he was resurrected near the mouth of The River . By near I mean he was only about 20,000 kilometers distant . This was in the arctic region . The River 's mouth is , like its headwaters , near the North Pole . However , the two seem to be diametrically opposite , the waters issuing from the mountains in one hrinisphere and emptying into the mountains in the other hemisphere . From what I 've heard , there 's a sea around the North Pole , and it 's walled by a circular mountain which would make Mount Everest look like wart . The sea pours out of a hole at the base of the mountains , winds back and forth in one hemisphere , finally curving around the South Pole to the other hemisphere . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the arctic and back again a thousand or so times , and finally empties into the north polar mountains . ( Actually , it 's one mountain  --  like a volcanic cone . ) If I drew a sketch of The River , it 'd look like the Midgard Serpent of Norse myth , a world-girdling snake with its tail in its mouth . Tom said that the areas near the mouth are populated chiefly by Ice Agers , ancient Siberians , and Eskimos . There 's a scattering of modern Alaskans , upper Canadians , and Russians , though . And some others from everywhere and every time . Tom , being the adventurer that he is , decided to travel to the mouth . He and six others made some kayaks and paddled downstream from the land of the living into the wasteland of the fog shrouds . Surprisingly , vegetation grew in the mists and the darkness all the way to the mouth . Also , the grailstones extended for a thousand kilometers into the fog . The expedition had its last grail meal at the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread and what they 'd saved from the grails , they paddled on , the ever increasing current speeding them toward their goal . The last hundred kilometers was in a current against which there was no turning back . They could n't even try for the shore ; sheer canyon walls soared up from the edge of the water . The voyageurs were forced to eat and sleep sitting up in their kayaks . It looked like curtains , finit , for them , and it was . They plunged into a great cave the ceiling and walls of which were so far away that Tom 's torchlight could not reach them . Then , with a horrible roaring , The River entered a tunnel . By then the ceiling was so low that Tom 's head was knocked against it . That 's all he remembers . Undoubtedly , the kayak was torn to pieces against the ceiling . Tom woke up the next day somewhere near the south polar region . ( Frigate 's letter continued ) " There 's a tower in the middle of a sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A lower ? " I said . " What do you mean ? " " Have n't you heard about that ? I thought everybody knew about the tower . " " Nobody ever mentioned it to me . " " Well , " he said , looking somewhat peculiar , " it is a hell of a long River . I suppose there are plenty of areas where nobody 's heard the tale . " And he proceeded to tell me that that was just what it was , a tale . No proof . The man who told Tom about it may have been a liar , and God knows there are just as many here as there were on Earth . But this was n't an account heard from a man who 'd heard it from another who 'd heard it from still another and so on and so on . Tom himself had actually talked to a man who claimed to have seen the tower . Tom had known this man for a long time , but he 'd never said a word about it until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sobered up , he refused to talk about it . He was too scared . He was an ancient Egyptian , one of a party led by the Pharaoh Akhenaten or Ikhnaton , as some pronounced it . You know , the one who tried to found a monotheist religion about the thirteenth century B.C. Apparently , Akhenaten was resurrected in an area of people from his own time . The teller of the tale , Paheri , a nobleman , was recruited by Akhenaten along with forty others . They built a boat and started off , not knowing how far they had to go . Or , indeed , what their goal was , except ( lie source of The River . Akhenaten believed that Aton , God , the sun , would live there and that he would receive any pilgrim with great honor . Would , in fact , pass him on to paradise , a place better than The 1tiverworld . Paheri , unlike the Pharaoh , was a conservative polytheist . He believed in the " true " gods : Ra , Horus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his Pharaoh , thinking that he would Iead them to the seat of the gods and would then get his just deserts for having abandoned the old religion on Earth . Poetic justice . But he , Paheri , would be suitably rewarded for his faith . Fortunately for their quest , the area in which they 'd been first rrstirrected was in the northern hemisphere , far up The River . Also fortunately , they passed through areas mainly inhabited by **34;4379;TOOLONG . These were comparatively peaceful , so the boat 's crew was n't enslaved , and there was no problem using the grailstones . As they got closer to the polar mountains , they came into an area populated by giant subhumans . These seem to have been a species the fossils of which were never found on Earth . Eight to ten feet high ( 2.45 top2283.048 meters ) , believe it or not . With noses like proboscis monkeys . Language users , though their speech was simple . Any one of these behemoths could have wiped out the whole crew singlehanded , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monster , a dragon . Apparently , their area , which extended for several thousand kilometers , was cut off from the area below them by a very narrow valley . The River boiled through it at great pressure , making a current against which a boat could not be rowed . The Egyptians were n't stopped by this . It took them six months , but they made it . Using flint tools and some iron tools  --  there was some iron in this area for which they traded booze and tobacco from their grails  --  they chopped out a narrow ledge about 3 meters above the water . They disassembled the boat and , carrying the parts on their backs , they crawled the kilometer or so to the end of the narrow part . In the land of the giants , the Egyptians recruited an individual whose name they could n't pronounce . They called him Djehuti ( the Greek form of this name was Thoth ) because his long nose reminded them of that god . Thoth had the head of an ibis , a long-beaked bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grailstones ceased . This area was in perpetual fog . Though The River had given up much of its heat while going through the sea behind the polar mountains , it still had enough left to form clouds when it encountered the colder air . They came to a cataract that was wide enough to float the moon on , or so said Paheri . The boat had to be left behind then , and for all anybody knows it is still on a platform in a sheltered cove . Rotten by now , what with all that moisture . Now , here comes one of the strangest parts of the tale . The expedition came to a cliff which seemed insurmountable . But they found a tunnel which someone had cut through the cliff . And then , later , at the bottom of another insurmountable cliff , they found the end of a rope made from cloths . Up it they went , and though their path was anything but smooth from then on , they did get to the polar sea beyond the mountains . Who made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It seems obvious to me that someone prepared the way for us Earthlings . I doubt that it was Riverdwellers who cut the tunnel and who planted the rope . The mountain which contained the tunnel was made of hard quartz . The tunnel would have worn out a large number of steel tools , which would not in any event have been available in large numbers . Moreover , Paheri said that there was no debris , no cuttings and shavings which would have to be piled outside the tunnel . Even with iron tools , a party would notp229have time enough to cut the tunnel . They could n't possibly have brought along enough food for the time it would take to do the job . In addition , how could anyone have gotten up the aforementioned cliff ' without a rope ? Maybe some mysterious party preceding the Egyptians fired a rocket trailing a rope ? But there was only one projection , a tall , thin spire of rock , for the hypothetical rope with hypothetical grapnels to catch on . The chances of the rocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and the grapnels catching on it are highly remote . Also , there was no empty rocket case around . Whoever had lowered the rope had tied the end of the rope around the projection . And Paheri said that it looked as if the projection had been cut out of a larger spire . Anyway , after crawling on a ledge through a dark cave through which a cold wind howled , they came out onto the sea . Clouds covered the sea from rim to rim of the unbroken range circling the sea . Only it was n't really unbroken . On the other side there must have been a great gap between two mountains . Djehuti saw it first ; he went around a corner just as the sun broke through for a moment . Those behind him heard a cry , then a bellow , and then a long , dwindling wail . They inched around the corner and got to the edge of the ledge just in time to see Djehuti 's body disappear in the clouds below . Afterward , they reconstructed what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grail a few paces before him . Yes , a grail . Someone had preceded them . Apparently , Djehuti saw it , too , and then the sun shone through the gap in the mountain . Blinded , or startled , he had stepped backward and tripped over the grail . There was just enough light from the passing sun to give a glimpse of something in the middle of the sea . It looked like the upper end of a colossal grail sticking from the clouds . Then the sun passed the gap and the clouds rolled back up and covered the big grail . You 're probably asking , how could the Egyptians see the sun ? Even if the break in the mountains extended to the horizon , would n't the clouds still cover it ? The answer is , yes , the clouds would cover it under normal circumstances . But there was a combination of wind which cleared the clouds away momentarily just as the sun passed the gap . An unhappy combination of circumstances , for Djehuti , anyway . The winds are peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away so that the Egyptians could see , briefly , the upper portion of the tower . Without the direct rays of the sun , in the gloomy twilight of reflection from the skies , they could see only a dark bulk . But it was enough . There was an object out there , a vast object . Not necessarily ap230manmade object , since we do n't know if the owners and operators of this planet are human . But it was an artifact ; it was too smoothly cylindrical to be anything else . Though , at that distance , it could have been a spire of rock , I suppose . But here 's another clincher . Several hours later the Egyptians saw an object rise up from the clouds around the tower . It was round , and for them to see it from where they stood , it must have been enormous . When it got far up , it reflected light from the never setting sun . Then it rose so high it became invisible . That really excited me . I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Whomever is behind all this ? " " That 's what Frisco and I think . " The Egyptians had become fond of Djehuti . Despite his ogreish appearance , he had a good heart , and he liked to joke . He was n't above making puns in Egyptian , which shows a considerable intelligence on his part . Humankind is unique in the animal kingdom ; it 's the only species that can pun . Homo agnominatio ? I do n't know . My Latin gets weaker by the day . If I could find an ancient Roman or a Latin scholar I 'd take a refresher course . Back to Paheri 's tale . And Djehuti . If it had n't been for his gorillan strength , the Egyptians would n't have gotten as far as they did . So they said some prayers over him and pushed on down the path . The narrow ledge inclined , generally , at a 45-degree angle and was slippery with moisture . It was just wide enough for one man to walk along , his shoulder brushing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face the cliff and slide along it , their chests against the rock , their heels hanging over the edge , their fingers clutching every tiny roughness . Halfway down , Akhenaten almost fell off . He 'd stumbled in the fog over a skeleton . Yes , a skeleton , undoubtedly the one who 'd abandoned the grail . None of his bones seemed to be broken , so they guessed that he had died of starvation . The Pharaoh said a prayer over the bones and cast them into the sea . After a while they came to the end of the path . This was at sea level . They despaired then , but Akhenaten grabbed hold of an outcropping with one hand and with a torch in his other hand looked around the projection . On the other side was an opening , the mouth of a cave . He eased around the outcropping , the sea up to his knees , his feet on the underwater continuation of the ledge . His torch showed him a smoothp231rock floor that slanted upward at a 30-degree angle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead , they walked up the slope . Their hearts beat hard , their skins were cold , their teeth chattered . One man  --  our Paheriwasso scared that he had nervous diarrhoea . Was this the entrance to the hall of the gods ? Was jackal-headed Anubis waiting to conduct them to the great judge who would balance their good deeds against the bad ? It was then that Paheri got to thinking about the mean and unjust things he 'd done , his pettinesses and cruelties , his greed and treachery . For a moment he refused to go on . But when the others kept walking , and the darkness began to press in on him , he resumed walking  --  though at a distance behind them . The cave became a tunnel , the rock walls evidently worked by tools . It began curving gently and then , after a hundred meters , it entered a very large circular chamber . This was lit by nine black metal lamps on tall tripods . The lamps were ball shaped , and they burned with a cold , steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonish them . The nearest , though , was another skeleton . Like the other , it was still clothed . The right arm was fully extended as if it had been reaching out for something . Beside it was a grail . At the moment , they did n't examine the bones , but I 'll describe it now . It was the skeleton of a female , and the skull and some still unrotted patches of hair showed that it was a Negress 's . She had probably died of starvation . That was tragically ironic , since she had died a few meters from food . After her companion had died , she 'd gone on , probably crawling part of the way , summoning enough strength to stand up and edge around the very narrow places . Then , with salvation in sight , she had died . I wonder who she was ? What drove her to take that perilous journey ? How many of her party died or turned back before they got through the vast cave through which the waves of the polar sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , big-nosed colossi ? What was her name , and why was she so fiercely determined to drive on into the heart of darkness ? Perhaps she may have left a message inside her grail . However , its lid was closed , and so only she could open it . Anyway , it 's very unlikely that the Egyptians could have read her writing . This was before the Chancers spread Esperanto around the world . Furthermore , billions who can speak this language do n't know how to read it.  |p232The  Egyptians said a prayer over the bones and then silently inspected the largest objects in the chamber , metal boats . There were eleven , some large , some small , all in low , metal V-shaped supports open at both ends . There were also supplies of food . They did n't know that at first , since they 'd never seen plastic cans . But diagrams on plastic sheets indicated how to open them , which they did . They contained beef , bread , and vegetables . They ate heartily , and then they slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey . But they felt that the gods ( in Akhenaten 's view , The God ) had provided for them . A path had been prepared for them , though it had not been an easy one . The road to immortality had never been easy , and only the virtuous and hardy would traverse it . Perhaps Djehuti had sinned in some way and so had been hurled from the ledge by the gods . There were diagrams , how-to-do-it sketches using signs , in the boats . They studied these and then carried one of the large boats through the tunnel . It could hold thirty people , but four people could lift it easily or one strong man could drag it . It was shoved over the ledge into the sea , which was moderately rough , and the party got into it . There was a small control board by the wheel . Though he was a Pharaoh and so above work of any kind , Akhenaten nevertheless took over the controls . Following the diagrammed instructions , lie punched a button on the board . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tower appeared on it . He punched another button , and the boat moved of its own accord outward into the sea . Everybody was scared , of course , though their leader did not show it . Yet they felt that they were in the right place and were welcome  --  in a sense . The boat they likened to the barge in which , in their religion , the dead journeyed across the waters of the Other World , Amenti . ( Amenti comes from Ament , a goddess whose name meant " the Westerner . " She wore a feather , as did the Libyans , the people to the west of Egypt . She may have been a Libyan goddess borrowed by the Egyptians . A feather was also the sign or hieroglyph for the word " Western . " In later times , " the West " meant the Land of the Dead , and Ament became the goddess of the country of the dead . She it was who welcomed them at the gate of the Other World . She proffered them bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became " friends of the gods . " ) Naturally , the food they 'd found in the cave reminded them of this , just as the boat was an analog of the barge used by the dead in the Other World . The Egyptians , like many people , had been upset , not to mention outraged , when they woke from death upon The Riverworld . This was notp233what the priests had said would happen to them after death . Yet , there were parallels here , physical analogs , to the promised land . Also , that there was a River was comforting . They had always been a riparian folk , living close to the Nile . And now they had been guided by a divine being to the heart of the Other World . They wondered if they should have named the giant subhuman Anubis instead of Djehuti . Anubis was the jackal-headed god who conducted the dead in the Underworld to the Double Palace of Osiris , the judger , the Weigher of Souls . Still , Djehuti was the spokesman of the gods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shape of a dog-headed ape . Considering their companion 's features and his hairiness , he did look like that avatar of Djehuti . Note : These two aspects of Thoth ( Djehuti ) indicate that there may have been a fusion of two different gods in early times . This world did have some similarities to the Other World . Now that they were in the Abode of Osiris , the similarities were even more striking . The Riverworld could be that country between the world of the living and the dead vaguely described by the Priests . The priests had told confusing , contradictory stories . Only the gods knew the full truth . Whatever the truth was , it would soon be found . The tower did n't look like their picture of the Double Hall of justice , but perhaps the gods had changed things . The Riverworld was a place of constant change , a reflection of the state of mind of the gods themselves . Akhenaten turned the wheel so that the orange tower was bisected by the vertical line splitting the screen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of the speed , he would squeeze the bulb fixed to the right side of the steering wheel . The boat 's speed would increase or decrease according to the force of the squeezing . The boat headed straight through the choppy , fog-shrouded sea for the tower at a speed frightening to its passengers . Within two hours the image on the screen had become enormous . Then the image burst into a flame which covered the entire screen , and Akhenaten let the boat proceed very slowly . He punched a button , and they all cried out in fright and wonder as two round objects on the prow of the boat shot forth two bright beams of light . Ahead lay a vast bulk  --  the tower . Akhenaten punched a button indicated by the diagram . Slowly , a large , rrurnd door , a port , swung open from what had been a smooth , seamless surface . Light sprang into being . Inside was a wide hall , its walls of the uric grey metal.  |p234Akhenaten  brought the boat alongside the entrance . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the button which shut off the invisible power that moved the boat . He stepped onto the side of the boat , which was just below the threshold . After jumping inside the hall , he took the ropes attached to the inside of the hull and secured them around hooks set into the hall . Apprehensively , silently , the others followed him . All , that is , except for Paheri . The terror was now almost unendurable . His teeth clicked uncontrollably . His knees shook . His heart beat in his frozen flesh like a frightened bird 's wings . His mind moved sluggishly , like winter mud flowing down a hillside warmed by the sun . He was too weak to get up from the seat and step into the corridor . He was sure that if he could go on , he 'd face his judge and be found wanting . I 'll say one thing for Paheri . Two . He did have a conscience , and he was n't afraid to admit to Tom Rider that he 'd been a coward . That takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear from The One God , walked steadily toward the end of the corridor . The others were bunched behind him at a dozen paces . One looked back and was surprised that Paheri was still in the boat . He gestured for him to come on . Paheri shook his head and hung on to the gunwale . Then , without a single cry from anyone , those in the corridor slumped to their knees , fell forward on their hands , tried to rise , failed , and sagged onto their faces . They lay as still and limp as putty models . The door swung slowly shut . It closed silently , leaving no evidence that there was a door , not even a thin seamline , and Paheri was alone in the dark fog and the cold sea . Paheri wasted no time in getting the boat turned around . It moved at its former speed , but now there was no signal on the scope , no bright image , to direct it . He could not find the cave , and so he went up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up trying to locate the cave . Finally , he directed it alongside the cliff until he came to the archway through which the sea rams into the mountains . He got through the long and giant cave there , but when he came to the great cataract , he could find no place to beach the boat . It was carried over the falls . Paheri remembered the bellowing of the waters , being turned over and over , and then ... unconsciousness . When he awoke from his translation , he was lying naked in the dark fog under the overhang of a grailstone . His grail  --  a new one , of course  --  and a pile of cloths lay by him . Presently he heard voices . The dim figuresp235of people coming to place their grails on the stone approached . He was safe and sound  --  except for the terrible memory of the hall of the gods . Tom Rider was translated to Paheri 's area after he 'd been killed by some fanatical medieval Christians . He became a soldier , met Paheri , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rider worked up to a captaincy and then he was killed again . He awoke the next day in an area where Farrington lived . Several months later they went up-River together in a dugout . Then they settled down for a while to build the Razzle Dazzle . What 's my reaction to all this ? Well , Paheri 's story makes me want to go see for myself if it 's true or not . If he was n't making it up , and Tom says Paheri was as stolid and as unimaginative as a wooden cigarstore Indian , then this world , unlike Earth , may have answers to the Big Questions , a mirror to the Ultimate Reality . Towerward ho ! ( Frigate 's letter continued ) There 's more to the story than what Rider told me . I chanced to overhear Frisco and Tex several days ago . They were in the main cabin , and the hatch was open . I had sat down , my back against the cabin , and had lit up a cigar . ( Yes , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ole Devil Nicotine . ) I really was n't paying much attention to their voices , since I was occupied with thoughts resulting from a conversation with Nur el-Musafir . Then I heard the captain , who has a loud voice , say , " Yes , but how do we know he is n't using us for some reason of his own ? Some reason beneficial to him but not so good for us ? And how do we know we can get into the tower ? That Egyptian could n't . Is there another entrance ? If there is , why did n't he tell us ? He did say he 'd tell us more about the tower later on . But that was sixteen years ago ! Sixteen ! We ai n't seen him since ! " I mean , you ai n't seen him . Of course , I never did see him . Anyway ,  |p236maybe  something happened to him . Maybe he got caught . Or maybe he does n't need us anymore ! " Rider said something I could n't catch . Farrington said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I think he did n't have the he talked to you . " Rider said something . Farrington replied , " The tunnel and the rope and the boats and probably the path must have been prepared for us . But others got there first . " The wind strengthened then , and I could n't hear anything for a minute or two . I moved closer to the companionway well . Farrington said , " You really think some of them , one , anyway , might be on this ship ? Well , it 's possible , Tex , but so what if it is ? " Why were n't we told who the others were so we could recognize each other and get together ? When are we going to be told ? Where do we all meet ? At River 's end ? What if we get there and nobody shows up ? Do we wait a hundred years or so there ? What if . .. " Rider broke in once more . He must have talked a long time . I was straining my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shone with a sort of St. Elmo 's fire . Mustafa , at the wheel , was looking at me with a strange expression . He must have known , or guessed , that I was eavesdropping . This made me uneasy . I wanted desperately to hear the rest . But if the Turk told those two I 'd been listening to them , I might get tossed off the ship . On the other hand , he could n't know that they were discussing anything I should n't be hearing . So I puffed on my cigar , and when it was out , I pretended to fall asleep . The situation reminded me of Jim Hawkins ' experience in the apple barrel in Treasure Island , when he overheard Long John Silver plotting with his pirate cronies to take over the Hispaniola after the treasure was found . Only , in this case , Farrington and Rider were n't planning anything evil against anybody at all . They seemed to be more plotted against . Farrington said , " What I 'd like to know is why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a dozen gods , and if he 's going against his buddies , what help can he get from mere mortals like us ? And if he wants us in the tower , why does n't he just ferry us to it ? " There was another interruption , followed by the clink of grail cups against each other . Then Rider spoke loudly . " ... must have damn good reasons . Anyway , we 'll find out in time . And what else do we have to do ? " Farrington bellowed laughter , then said , " That 's right ! What else ?  |p237Might  as well use our time for some end , good or bad . But I still feel like we 're being exploited , and I 'm fed up with that . I was exploited by the rich and the middle class when I was young , and then when I became famous and rich , I was exploited by editors and publishers and then by my relatives and friends . I ai n't going to let anybody exploit me here on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit for nothing but shoveling coal or canning fish ! " " You did some self-exploiting , too , " Rider said . " Did n't we all ? I made plenty of money and so did you . And what happened ? We spent more'n we made on big houses and fast cars and bad investments and booze and whores and putting on a big front . We could 've played it smart and tight and saved our money and taken it easy and lived to ripe old ages in ease and plenty . But ... " Farrington exploded into laughter again . " But we did n't , did we ? That was n't our nature , Tex , and it ai n't now . Live it up , burn the candle at both ends , spin off fire and beauty like a St. Catherine 's wheel instead of trudging along like a steer turning a mill wheel ! So the deballed beast gets turned out to pasture instead of going to the glue factory ? So what ? What does he have to think about while he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , grey future ? " More clinking . Then Farrington started to tell Rider about a train trip he 'd taken from San Francisco to Chicago . He had introduced himself to a beautiful woman who was accompanied by her child and a maid . It was n't more than an hour after meeting her that he and the woman went to his compartment , where they coupled like crazed minks for three days and nights . I decided that then was a good time to leave . I got up and strolled to the foremast where Abigail Rice and Nur were talking . Mustafa apparentlynever suspected me of eavesdropping . Since then , I 've been wondering . Who was the he referred to ? It 's obvious that he must be one of Those who have made this world for us and then raised us from the dead . Could it really be ? The idea seemed so tremendous , so difficult to grasp . Yet  --  Somebody has to have done this , Somebodies , I should say . And they are truly gods , in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a tower in the north polar sea . And by implication it 's a base for Whomever made this world , our secret masters . Yes , I know this sounds paranoid . Or like a science fiction tale , mast of which were paranoid , anyway . But , except for the very few who got rich , science fiction writers were convinced that their secret ( or not sop238secret ) masters were the publishers . Even the rich ones questioned their royalty statements . Maybe the tower is inhabited by a cabal of superpublishers . ( Just kidding , Bob . I think . ) Maybe Rider is lying . Or his informant , Paheri , was lying . I do n't believe so . It 's obvious that Rider and Farrington have been approached by one of these Whomevers . They were n't just making up this story to fool an eavesdropper . Or were they ? How paranoid can you get ? No , they were discussing something that had really happened . If they were careless , left the hatch open , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those years , who would n't get careless ? As far as that goes , why should n't they tell everybody ? Somebody might be looking for them . Who ? Why ? My mind yaws , pitches , and rolls . So many speculations , so many possibilities . And I think , wow ! What a story ! Too bad I had n't thought of something like this when I was writing science fiction . But the concept of a planet consisting of a **28;4415;TOOLONG river along which all of humanity that ever lived had been resurrected ( a good part of it , anyway ) would have been too big to put in one book . It would have taken at least twelve books to do it anywhere near justice . No , I 'm glad I did n't think of it . In light of those developments , what do I do now ? Should I mail this letter or tear it up ? It wo n't fall into your hands , of course , not a chance of that . Into whose , then ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even read English . Why am I afraid it might fall into the wrong hands ? I really do n't know . But there is a dark , secret struggle going on under the seemingly simple life of this Valley . I intend to find out just what it is . I 'll have to proceed cautiously though . A small voice tells me that I might be better off if I do n't know anything about this . Anyway , to whom am I really writing these missives ? To myself , probably , though I hope hopelessly that just possibly impossibly one might drift into the hands of someone I knew and loved or at least was fond of . And yet , this very moment , as I stare across the water at the many people on the bank , I might be looking directly at the person to whom I 've written one of these letters . But the ship is in the middle of The River just now , and I 'm too far away to recognize anyone recognizable . Great God , the faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than Ip239ever saw on Earth . Some of the faces came into being three hundred thousand years ago or more . Undoubtedly , the faces of many of my ancestors , some of them Neanderthals . A certain number of Homo neanderthalis was absorbed by miscegenation into Homo sapiens , you know . And considering the flux and reflux of large groups through prehistory and history , migrations , invasions , slavery , individual travel , some , maybe many , of the Mongolian , Amerindian , Australoid , and Negro faces I 've seen belong to my ancestors . Consider this . Each generation of your ancestors , going back in time , doubles its number . You were born in 1925 . You had two parents , born in 1900 . ( Yes , I know you were born in 1923 and your mother was forty when she bore you . But this is an ideal case , an average . ) Your parents ' parents were born in 1875 . That makes four . Double your ancestors every twenty-five years . By 1800 , you have thirty-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , but they were " destined " to be your **30;4445;TOOLONG . In 1700 A.D. , you have five hundred twelve ancestors . In 1600 A.D. , 8192 ancestors . In 1500 A.D. , 131,072 ancestors . In 1400 , 2,097,152 . In 1300 , 33,554,432 . By 1200 A.D. , you have 536,870,912 ancestors . So do I. So does everybody . If the world population was , say , two billion in 1925 ( I do n't remember what it was ) , then multiply that by the number of your ancestors in 1200 A.D. You get over one quadrillion . Impossible ? Right . I just happen to remember that in 1600 the estimated world population was five hundred million . In I A.D. , it was an estimated 138,000,000 . So , the conclusion is obvious . There was a hell of a lot of incest , close and remote , going on in the past . Not to mention the present . Probably from the dawn of humankind . So , you and I are related . And , in fact , it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How many Chinese and black Africans born in 1925 were distant cousins of you and me ? Plenty , I 'd say . So , the faces I see on both banks as I sail along are my cousins ' . Hello , Jiang Chow . Yiya , Bulabula . What 's happening , Hiawatha ? Hail , Og , Son of Fire ! But even if they knew this , they would n't feel any more friendly toward me . Or vice versa . The most intense quarreling and the most vicious bloodletting take place in families . Civil wars are the worst wars . But then , since we 're all cousins , all wars are civil . Mighty uncivil , at the same time . The paradox of human relations . I 'll shoot your ass off , brother . Mark Twain was right . Did you ever read his Extract from Captainp240Stormfleld 's Visit to Heaven ? Old Stormfield was shocked when he got past the Pearly Gates because there were so many dark people . Like all of us pale Caucasians , he had envisioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there a few yellow , brown , and black ones . But it was n't that way . He 'd forgotten that the dark-skinned peoples had always outnumbered the whites . In fact , for every white face he saw there were two dark ones . And that 's the way it is here . My hat is off to you , Mr. Twain . You told it like it was gon na be . So , here we are in the Rivervalley , knowing not why and whence . Just like on Earth . Of course , there are plenty of people who say they know . There are the two dominant churches , the Chancers and the Nichirenites , and a thousand sects of reformed Christians , Moslems , Jews , Buddhists , Hindus , and God knows what all . The former Taoists and Confucianists say they do n't give a damn ; this is a better life , on the whole , than the last one . The totemists are in a bit of a bind , since there are no animals here . But that does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the savage I 've run into who sees his totem in dreams or visions . The majority of them , though , have been converted to one of the " higher " religions . There 's also Nur el-Musafir . He 's a Sufi . He was just as shocked as anybody to wake up here . He was n't outraged , however , and he reorderedhis thinking tout de suite . He says that whatever beings have made this world have done so with only our eventual good in mind . Otherwise , why go to all this great expense and trouble ? ( In this , he sounds like a barker for a circus . But he 's sincere . Which does n't mean he knows what he 's talking about . ) We should n't concern ourselves with the Who or the How , he says . Just with the Why . In this respect , he sounds like a Chancer . But I see I 'm about to run out of my quota of paper . So , adiau , adios , selah , amen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English so long is from selang , the Moslem Malayan 's pronunciation of the Arabic salaam . ) Amicably and didactically yours in the bowels of Whomever , PETER JAIRUS FRIGATEP.S . I still do n't know if I 'll mail this in toto , censor it , or use it for toilet paper.  |p241ON  THE AVERAGE , THE RIVER WAS 2.4135 KILOMETERS OR A MILE AND Ahalf wide . Sometimes it narrowed into channels always lined by high hills ; sometimes it widened into a lake . Whatever its breadth , its depth was everywhere about 305 meters or a trifle over 1000 feet . Nowhere along The River was there water erosion of the banks . The grass on the plains merged into an aquatic grass at the water level , and the latter flourished on the sides and bottom of the channel . The roots of this fused with the roots of the surface grass to form an interconnected mass . The grass was not separate blades ; it was one vast vegetable entity . The water plants were eaten by a multitude of fish life from surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stratum , where the sunlight penetrated . Others , paler creatures but no less voracious , swarmed in the middle layer . In the darkness of the bottom many weird forms scuttled , crawled , wriggled , jetted , swam . Some ate the leprous-white rooted things that looked like flowers or were in turn enfolded and digested by them . Others , large and small , slid steadily along , mouths gaping , collecting the microscopic life that also lived in the fluid strata . The largest of all , vaster than the blue whale of Earth , was a carnivorous fish called the riverdragon . It shared with a much smaller water dweller the ability to roam the bottom or skim the surface without harm from change in pressure . The other creature had many names , but in English it was generally called " croaker . " It was the size of a German police dog , as slow as a sloth , and as undiscriminating in appetite as a hog . The chief sanitation engineer of The River , it ate anything that did not resist it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the human turd . A lungfish , it also foraged ashore at night . Many a human had been liightened on seeing its huge goggle eyes in the fog or when stumbling over its slimy body as it crawled around seeking garbage and crap . Almostp242as scary as its appearance was its loud croak , evoking images of monsters and ghosts . On this day of year 25 A.R.D. , one of these vilely stinking scavengers was near a bank . Here the current was weaker than in the middle . Even so , its fin-legs were going at near top speed to keep it from being moved backward . Presently , its nose detected a dead fish floating toward it . It moved out a little and waited for the carcass to drift into its mouth . Along came the fish and another object immediately behind it . Both went into the croaker 's mouth , the fish sliding down the gullet easily , the larger object sticking for a moment before a convulsive swallow drew it in . For five years , the watertight bamboo jar containing Frigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast numbers of fishers and voyagers , it should have been picked up and opened long before . However , it was ignored by all creatures except for the fish whose primary object had been the delectable rotting chub . Five days before the container came to journey 's end , it had drifted past the area in which its intended recipient lived . But Rohrig was in a hut , surrounded by the stone and wood sculptures he fashioned for trade in booze and cigarettes , snoring off the effects of a big party . Perhaps it was just coincidence , perhaps some psychic principle was responsible , a vibratory link between the addresser and the addressee . Whatever the cause , Rohrig was dreaming of Frigate that early morning . He was back in 1950 when he had been a graduate student supported by the G.I. Bill and a working wife . It was a warm , late-May day ( Mayday ! Mayday ! ) . He was sitting in a small room , facing three Ph.D.s . This was the day of reckoning . After five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would gain or lose the prize , a Master of Arts in English literature . If he passed his oral defense of his thesis , he would go out into the world as a teacher of high-school English . If he failed , he would have to study for six months and then try for a second and final chance . Now the three inquisitors , though smiling , were shooting questions at him as if they were arrows and he was the target  --  which was the case . Rohrig was not nervous since his thesis was on medieval Welsh poetry , a subject he 'd chosen because he believed that the professors knew very little about it . He was right . But Ella Rutherford , a charming lady of forty-six , though prematurely white haired , had it in for him . Some time ago they 'd been lovers , meeting twice a week in her apartment . Then one afternoon they had gotten into a furious drunken argument about the merits of Byron asp243a poet . Rohrig was n't crazy about his verse , but he admired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true poetry . Anyway , he liked to take the opposite side of an argument . As a result , he had stormed out of the apartment after saying some very cruel things to her . He had also shouted at her that he never wanted to see her in private again . Rutherford believed that he had seduced her just to get a high grade in her course , that he was using the argument as an excuse to quit making love to a middle-aged woman . She was wrong . He was compulsively attracted to older women . However , he was finding her demands too great a strain . He could no longer satisfy her , his wife , two female sophomores , two of his friends ' wives , a female bartender who gave him free drinks , and the superintendent of the apartment building in which he lived . Five , he could handle ; eight , no . He was being drained of time , energy , and semen , and he was falling asleep in class . Thus , he had craftily started violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was rumored that she had the clap ) , and the wife of a friend ( she was too emotionally demanding , anyway ) . Now , Rutherford , her watery blue eyes narrowed , said , " You 've done very well in your defense , Mister Rohrig . So far . " She paused . He felt suddenly chilled . His anus tightened . Sweat poured down his face and from his armpits . He had visions of her sitting up late nights thinking of some way to get him , some horrible , peculiarly humiliating way . Doctors Durham and Pur quit drumming their fingers . This was getting interesting . Their colleague was burning bright , like the eyes of a tiger about to spring on a tethered lamb . Lightning was going to strike , and the unfortunate candidate was without a grounding rod , unless it was up his ass . Rohrig gripped the arms of his chair . Sweat popped out on his forehead like mice scared from a Swiss cheese ; sweat , acid sweat , nibbled at the armpits of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You seem to know your subject thoroughly . You 've given a remarkable demonstration of knowledge of a rather obscure field of poetry . I 'm sure we 're all proud of you . We have n't wasted our time with you in the classroom . " The sly bitch was telling him that she had wasted her time outside of the classroom with him . But this was only a sideswipe , a remark meant to injure but not to kill . She was setting him up for the big fall . It was w1dom , if ever , that the examining professors congratulated the candidatep244during the torture . Afterward , perhaps , when the board had voted that he be passed . " Now ... tell me , " Rutherford drawled . She paused . Another turn of the crank of the rack . " Tell me , Mister Rohrig . Just where is Wales ? " Something in him lost its hold and slid bumping down to the bottom of his stomach . He clapped his hand on his forehead , and he groaned . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor Pur , dean of women , turned pale . This was the first time in her life she had ever heard that vile word . Doctor Durham , who wept when reciting poetry to his students , looked as if he was about to swoon . Doctor Rutherford , having hurled her thunderbolt , smiled without pity or compassion upon the remains of her victim . Rohrig rallied . He refused to go down without his flags flying , the band playing Nearer My God to Thee . He smiled as if the gold in the pot at rainbow 's end had not suddenly been transmuted into turds . " I do n't know how you did it , but you got me ! O.K. I never said I was perfect . What happens now ? " Verdict : failed . Sentence : six months of probation with another and final inquisition at its end . Later , when he and Rutherford were alone in the hall , she said , " I suggest you study geography , too , Rohrig . I 'll give you a clue . Wales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help you . You could n't find your ass if it was handed to you on a silver platter . " His friend , Pete Frigate , was waiting at the end of the hall for him . Pete was one of the group of older students dubbed " The Bearded Ones " by a sophomore girl who liked to hang around them . They were all veterans whose college education had been interrupted by the war . They and their wives or mistresses led a life which was then called " Bohemian . " They were the unknown forerunners of the beatniks and the hippies . As Rohrig drew near , Frigate looked questioningly at him . Though Rohrig was near tears , he put on a big smile and then began laughing uproariously . " You wo n't believe this , Pete ! " Frigate did find it difficult to believe that anyone past the sixth grade of grammar school did not know where Wales was . When he was finally convinced , he too laughed . Rohrig shouted , " How in hell could that white-haired fox have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know , but she 's magnificent . Listen , Bob . Do n't feel so bad . I know a distinguished surgeon who does n't remember if the sun goes around the earth or the earth goes around the sun . He says it 's not necessary to know that when you 're digging into people 's bodies . " But an English major ... he ought at least to know ... ooh , haw , haw ! " In one of those non sequiturs the Dream Scripter so often writes , Rohrig found himself elsewhere . Now he was in fog and chasing a butterfly . It was beautiful , and what made it so valuable was that it was the only one of its kind and only Rohrig knew that it existed . It was striped with azure and gold , its antennae were scarlet , its eyes were green emeralds . The king of the dwarfs had fashioned it in his cave in the Black Mountains , and the Wizard of Oz had dunked it in the waters of life . Fluttering only an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mists . " Hold still , you son of a bitch ! Hold still ! " He plunged after it for what seemed like miles . Dimly , out of the corner of his eye , he could see shapes in the clouds , things standing as motionless and quietly as if they were carved from bone . Twice he distinguished a figure ; one wore a crown , the other had a horse 's head . Suddenly , he was confronted by one of the objects . He stopped since it seemed impossible for some reason to go around it . The butterfly hung for a moment above the top of the thing , then settled down upon it . Its green eyes glowed , and its front legs shook the antennae mockingly . Moving forward slowly , Rohrig saw that it was Frigate who was blocking his path . " Do n't you dare touch it ! " Rohrig whispered fiercely . " It 's mine ! " Frigate 's face was as expressionless as a knight 's visor . It always looked deadpan when Rohrig was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight . That had made Rohrig even more angry , and now it rocketed him to the point of utter madness . " Out of the way , Frigate ! Step aside or get knocked down ! " The butterfly , startled by the outburst , flew off into the fog . " I ca n't , " Frigate said . " Why not ? " Rohrig thundered as he hopped up and down in frustration . Frigate pointed downward . He was standing on a large red square . Adjoining it were other squares , some red , some black . " I got misplaced . I do n't know what 's going to happen now . It 's against the rules to put me on a red square . But then , who cares about rules ? Besides the pieces , I mean . "  | " Can I help you ? " Rohrig said . " How could you do that ? You ca n't help yourself . " Frigate pointed over Rohrig 's shoulder . " It 's going to catch you now . While you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Rohrig suddenly felt utterly terrified . There was something after him , something which would do something horrible to him . Desperately , he tried to move forward , to go over or around Frigate . But the red square held him as it held Frigate . " Trapped ! " He could still see the butterfly , a dot , a dust mote , gone . Forever . The fog had thickened . Frigate was only a blur . " I make my own rules ! " Rohrig shouted . A whisper came from the mists before him . " Quiet ! It 'll hear you ! " He awoke briefly . His hutmate stirred . " What 's wrong , Bob ? " " I 'm drowning in a surf of uncease . " " What ? " " Surcease . " He sank back into the primal ocean down to where drowned gods leaned in the ooze at crazy angles , staring with fish-cold eyes under barnacled crowns . Neither he nor Frigate knew that he could have answered one of the questions in the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north . His neighbors were prehistoric Scandinavians , Patagonian Indians , Ice Age Mongolians , and late-twentieth-century Siberians . Rohrig was quick at learning new languages and was soon fluent in a dozen , though he never mastered the pronunciation and he murdered the syntax . As he always did , he made himself at home , and he was soon friends with many . For a while , he even set himself up as a sort of shaman . Shamans , however , must take themselves seriously if they would succeed , and Rohrig was only serious about his sculpturing . Also , he began to tire of the cold . He was a sun worshipper ; his happiest days had been in Mexico where he was the first mate on a small coastal ship transporting frozen shrimp from Yucatan to Brownsville , Texas . He had been briefly involved in gun-smuggling there but had quit it before spending a few days in a Mexican jail . He had also quit Mexico . The authorities could not prove his guilt , but they suggested that he leave the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warm climate when along came Agatha Croomes . Agatha was a black woman , bornp2471713 , died 1783 , a freed slave , a backwoods Baptist preacher , a holy roller , four times married , mother of ten children , and a pipe smoker . She had been resurrected a hundred thousand grailstones away , but here she was . A vision had come to her , a vision in which God told her to come to His dwelling at the North Pole , where He would hand her the keys to kingdom come , to glory and salvation forever , to understanding of time and eternity , space and infinity , creation and destruction , death and life . She would also be the one to cast the devil into the pit , lock him up , and throw the key away . Rohrig thought she was crazy , but she intrigued him . Also , he was n't so sure that the solution to the mystery of this world did not lie at the beginning of The River . He knew that no one had ventured into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party of eleven , he would be among the first to reach the North Pole . If he had anything to do with it , he would be the very first person to get there . When their goal was in sight he was going to sprint ahead and plant on the site of the North Pole a stone statuette of himself , his name incised at the base . From then on , anybody who got there would know that he 'd been beat out for first place by Robert F. Rohrig . Agatha would n't take him , however , unless he believed in the Lord and the Holy Book . He hated to lie , but he told himself that he was n't really deceiving her . Deep down , he did believe in a god , though he was n't sure whether its name was Jehovah or Rohrig . As for the Bible , it was a book , and all books told the truth in the sense that their authors believed they were writing a kind of truth . Before the expedition reached the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to the enormous cave out of which The River fell , four decided that they would starve to death if they kept on going . Rohrig went on with Agatha Croomes and Winglat , a member of an Amerind tribe that had crossed from Siberia to Alaska sometime in the Old Stone Age . Rohrig would have liked to turn back , but he was n't going to admit that a crazy black woman and a paleolithic savage had more courage than he . Besides , Agatha 's preachings had almost convinced him that she had had a true vision . Maybe Almighty God and sweet Jesus were waiting for him . It would n't do to hold up the schedule . After they had crawled along the ledge in the cave and Winglat had slipped and fallen into The River , Rohrig told himself that he was as crazy as Agatha . But he went on . When they came to the place where the ledge sloped downward intop248the fog , the fog that covered a sea the sounds of which faintly reached them , they were very weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they did not find food within the day , they would die . Agatha , however , said that all they could eat was close at hand . She knew it was so because she had had a vision while they slept on the ledge within the cave . She had seen a place where meat and vegetables were in abundance . Rohrig watched her crawl away from him . After a while , he followed . But he left his grail behind because he was too weak to drag it . If he survived , he could always come back for it . The statuette was in the grail , and for a few seconds he considered removing it and taking it with him . To hell with it , he thought , and he went down the path . He never made it . Weakness overcame him ; his legs and arms just would not obey his will . Thirst killed him before starvation did its job . It was ironic that The River had rushed by him , and he could pot drink because he had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious fluid . A sea was booming against the rocks at the base of the cliffs , and he could not descend to it . " Coleridge would appreciate this , " he thought . " I wish I did . " He muttered , " Now I 'll never get the answers to my questions . Maybe it 's just as well . I probably would n't have liked them anyway . " Now Rohrig was sleeping uneasily in a but by The River in the equatorial zone . And Frigate , standing watch on the deck of a cutter , was chuckling . He was recalling Rohrig 's ordeal while defending his thesis . Perhaps it was telepathy that evoked the incident in their minds at the same time . It 's preferable to use Occam 's razor , that never dull but seldom used blade . Call it coincidence . The croaker placed itself directly in the path of the floating dead fish . The body went into the wide mouth of the amphibian . Frigate 's letter and its container , only a centimeter behind the carcass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gullet and became lodged in the croaker 's belly . Its stomach could easily handle garbage , excrement , and rotting flesh . But the cellulose fibers of the bamboo case were too tough for it to convert into absorbable form . After feeling sharp pain for a long time , the croaker died trying to pass the container . The letter often kills the spirit . Sometimes , the envelope does it.  |p249ALMOST  EVERYBODY WAS CHEERING . PEOPLE WERE CROWDING AROUND JILLand hugging and kissing her , and for once she did not mind . Most of the display of affection was due to booziness , she knew , but she still felt a warm glow within herself . If they had not been pleased , their very drunkenness could have resulted in open hostility . Perhaps she was not as disliked as she had thought . Here was David Schwartz , whom she had once overheard calling her " Old Frozen Face , " patting her on the back and congratulating her . Anna Obrenova was standing by Barry Thorn , though neither had spoken much to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased that Jill Gulbirra had been chosen over her . Perhaps she really did not care . Jill preferred to believe that the little blonde was seething with hate , though she could be wrong . Anna might have a rational attitude toward her . After all , she was a Johnny-come-lately , and Jill had dcvoted thousands of hours to the construction of the ship and the training of the crew . Firebrass had shouted for silence . The loud chatter and singing had finally stopped . Then he had said that he was announcing the roster of officers , and he had grinned at her . She had felt sick . His grin was malicious , she was sure of that . He was going to pay her back for all the cutting remarks she had made to him . Justified remarks , because she was not going to allow anyone to run over her just because she was a woman . licit he was in a position to get revenge . Yet , he had done the right thing , and he seemed to be happy about doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd , threw her arms around Firebrass and burst into tears . He thrust his tongue deep into her mouth and then patted her fanny . This time , she did not resent unasked-for familiarities . He was n't taking advantage of her emotions or being condescending . He was , after all , fond of her , and perhaps he was sexually attracted to her . Or perhaps he was just being ornery.  |p250Anna  , still smiling , held out her hand and said , " My sincerest congratulations , Jill . " Jill took the delicate and cool hand , felt an irrational , almost overpowering impulse to yank her arm out of its socket , and said , " Thank you very much , Anna . " Thorn waved to her and shouted something , congratulations , probably . He did , however , make no effort to come to her . A moment later , she stumbled weeping out of the ballroom . Before she had gotten home , she hated herself for having shown how strongly she felt . She had never cried in public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tears dried as she thought of her father and mother . Where were they ? What were they doing ? It would be nice if she could see them . That was all : nice . She did not want to live in the same area with them . They were not her old mother and father , grey haired , wrinkling , and fat , their main concerns their grandchildren . They would look as young as she , and they would have little in common with her except some shared experiences . They would bore her and vice versa . It would be a strain to pretend that the child-parent relationship had not died . Besides , she thought of her mother as a cipher , a passive appendage to her father , who was a violent , loud , domineering man . She did not really like him , though she had grieved somewhat when he had died . But that was because of what might have been , not because of what had been . For all she knew , they might be dead again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then why the second flood of tears ? " WELL , FOLKS , HERE WE ARE AGAIN . THIS TIME IT 'S THE BIG ONE . THE FINALtake-off . Heigh-ho for the Big Grail , the Misty Tower , the house of the Santa Claus at the North Pole , the Saint Nick who gave us the gifts of resurrection , eternal youth , free food , booze , and tobacco . " There must be at least a million people here . The stands are full , the hills are crowded , people are falling out of the trees . The police are having a hell of a time keeping order . It 's a beautiful day , is n't it always ? Thep251uproar is really something , and I do n't think you can hear a word I 'm saying even through this PA system . So , folks , up yours ! " Aha ! Some of you heard that . Just kidding , folks , just trying to get your attention . Let me tell you again about the Parseval . I know that you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are illiterates . Not that it 's your fault . You speak Esperanto , but you 've never had an opportunity to learn to read it . So here goes . Only , wait a moment while I moisten my parched throat with some skull-bloom . " Ah ! That was smoo-oo-ooth ! The only trouble is that I 've been quenching my thirst since before dawn , and I 'm having trouble seeing straight . I hate to think of tomorrow morning , but what the hell . You have to pay for everything good in this world , not to mention the others . " There she is , folks , though it 's hardly necessary to point her out to you . The Parseval . Named by Firebrass for the man who first suggested that the airship be built though there was a lot of argument at first about what name 'd be painted on her silver sides . " Third mate Metzing wanted to name her the Graf Zeppelin III , after the man who was responsible for the first airship commercial line and chiefly responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ought to be called Adam and Eve , after the whole human race , since she represents all of us . She also suggested Queen of the Skies and Titania . A little bit of female chauvinism there . Titania sounds too much like Titanic , anyway , and you know what happened to that ship . " No , you do n't . I forgot most of you never heard of her . " One of the engineers , I forget his name at the moment , he was a crewman on the ill-fated Shenandoah , wanted to name her Silver Cloud . That was the name of the airship in a book called Tom Swift and His Big Dirigible . " Another wanted to name her the Henri Gffard after the Frenchman who flew the first self-propelled lighter-than-air craft . Too bad old Henri could n't be here to see the culmination of the airship , the acme of dirigible art , the last and the best and the greatest of all aerial vessels . Too bad the whole human race ca n't be here to witness this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of the powers on high ! " Pardon me a moment , folks . Time for another libation to the gods to be poured down this dry throat instead of being wasted by pouring on the ground . " Aaah ! Mighty good , folks ! Drink up ! The liquor 's free , compliments of the house , which is the nation of Parolando.  | " So , folks , our esteemed ex-president , Milton Firebrass , ex-American , exastronaut , decided to call this colossus the Parseval . Since he 's the chief honcho , the big enchilada , the boss , that 's what she 's titled . " So ... oh , yeah , I started to give you her statistics . Captain Firebrass wanted to build the biggest dirigible ever built , and he did . She 's also the biggest that will ever be built , since there wo n't be any more . Maybe he should have called her The Last Is the Best . " Anyway , the Parseval is 2680 feet or 820 meters long . Its widest diameter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 120,000,000 cubic feet or 6,360,000 cubic meters . " The skin is of stressed duraluminum , and it contains eight large gas cells with smaller cells in the nose and tail fairings . Originally , she was to have thirteen gondolas suspended outside the hull , the control gondola and twelve motor gondolas , each containing two motors . This exterior mounting was required because of danger from the highly flammable hydrogen . But tests of the gas-cell material , the Riverdragon intestinal layers , showed that it did pass some gas  --  that 's a joke , folks !  --  and so Firebrass ordered his scientists to make a plastic material that would n't  --  in a manner of speaking  --  break wind . " They did so  --  when Firebrass says jump , everybody sets a new record  --  and ... ? What ? My assistant , Randy , says everybody ca n't set a record at once . Who cares ? Anyway , the hydrogen leakage is nil . " So , the control room and all the motors are inside the hull except for those in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , is 99.999 percent pure . " In addition to the crew of ninety-eight men and two women , the Parseval will carry two helicopters , each with a thirty-two person capacity , and a two-man glider . " But there wo n't be any parachutes . One hundred parachutes makes a heavy load , so it was decided not to carry any . That 's sheer confidence for you . More than I 'd have . " Look at her , folks ! Ai n't she something ! The sun shines on her as if she 's the glory of God herself ! Beautiful , beautiful , and magnificent ! " A great day for mankind ! There goes the orchestra , playing The Lone Ranger Overture . Ha ! Ha ! Just a little joke that 'd take too long to explain to you folks . It 's really the William Tell Overture by Rossini , I believe . Chosen by Firebrass as the take-off music , since he 's hung up on that fiery piece . Not to mention a few others , some of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another glass of ambrosia , Randy . Randy 's my assistantp253M.C. , folks , a writer of fantasies on Earth and now Parolando 's chief quality-control inspector for the alcohol works . Which is like appointing a wolf to guard a steak . " Aah ! Great stuff ! And here comes the Parseval now , moving out of the hangar ! Her nose is locked into the only mobile mooring mast in the world . The take-off will occur in just a few minutes . I can see through the windscreen of the control room or bridge , which is set in the nose . " The man in the middle , sitting at the control panel  --  you can see his head , I 'm sure  --  is chief pilot Cyrano de Bergerac . In his day he was an author , too , wrote novels about travel to the moon and the sun . Now he 's in an aerial machine the likes of which he never dreamed of , just as he never envisioned himself on such a voyage . Flying to the North Pole of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as far as I know , had described in the wildest of tales . Soaring in the wild blue yonder in the greatest zeppelin ever built , the greatest that will ever be built . Headed for a fabled tower in a cold , foggy sea . An aerial knight , a post-Terrestrial Galahad , questing for a giant grail ! " Cyrano 's running the whole operation all by himself . The ship 's completely automated ; its motors and rudder and elevators are tied into the control panel with electromechanical devices . There 's no need to have ruddermen and elevator men and telegraph signals to the motor engineers as they did in the old dirigibles . One man could pilot the ship all the way to the North Pole , if he could stay awake three and a half days , the estimated flight time . In fact , theoretically , the ship could fly itself there without a soul aboard . " And there by Cyrano 's right is the captain , our own Milton Firebrass . Iie 's waving now to the man who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benjamin , late of Louisiana and ex-attorney general of the late but not necessarily lamented Confederate States of America . " What ? Get your hands off me , friend ! No offense intended to any excitizenof the C.S.A . Take the drunken bum away , officers ! " And there , standing at the extreme left , is pilot third officer Mitya Nikitin . He promised to be sober during the flight and not hide any booze behind the gas cells , ha ! ha ! " To Nikitin 's right is first mate Jill Gulbirra . You 've given some of us a - hard time , Ms. Gulbirra , but we admire .. . " " There go the trumpets again . What a blast ! There 's Captain Firebrass , waving at us . So long , mon capitaine , bon voyage ! Keep us informed by radio . " And there go the cables from the tail . The ship is bobbing a little , butp254she 's settling down . I saw the balancing done a couple of hours ago . The ship 's so equili-bub-bub-rated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass could lift it with one hand . " Now her nose is uncoupled from the mobile mooring mast . There goes a little of the water ballast . Sorry about that , folks . We told you to stand back , not that some of you could n't stand a shower . " Now she 's rising a little . The wind 's carrying her backward , southward . But the propellers have already been swivelled at an angle to drive the ship up and northward . " There she goes ! Bigger than a mountain , lighter than a feather ! Off to the North Pole and the dark tower ! " My God , I 'm crying ! Must have had too much of the cup that cheers ! " UP ABOVE THE WORLD SO HIGH , THE AIRSHIP TWINKLED , THREADING THEneedle eye of the blue . At an altitude of 6.1 kilometers or a little over 20,000 feet , the crew of the Parseval had a broad view of The Riverworld . Jill , standing at the front windscreen , saw the twisting parallels of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking a great bend to the east about 20 kilometers ahead . Then the lines ran for 100 kilometers like thin Malayan krises , wavy blades , side by side , before turning northeastward . Now and then , The River bounced back a ray of the sun . The millions along its banks and on its surface were invisible from this height , and even the biggest vessels resembled the backs of surface-cruising dragonfish . The Riverworld looked as it was just before Resurrection Day . A photographer in the nose dome was making the first aerial survey of this planet . And the last . The photographs would be matched against the course of The River as reported via radio by the Mark Twain . However , there would be large gaps in the map made by the Parseval 's cartographer . The paddlewheeler had traveled far south , to the edge of the south polar regions , several times . So the airship 's cartographer could only comparep255his pictures with the maps transmitted by the surface vessels in the northern hemisphere . But he could make one sweep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would travel some day . The radar was also making altitude measurements of the mountain walls . So far , the highest point was 4564 meters or 15,000 feet . At most points , the mountains were only 3048 meters or 10,000 feet . Sometimes the walls dipped as low as 1524 meters or 5000 feet . Before coming to Parolando , Jill had assumed , along with everybody else she knew , that the mountains were from 4564 to 6096 meters high . These were eyeball estimates , of course , and no one she had known had ever tried to make a scientific measurement . Not until she was in Parolando , where late-twentieth-century devices were available , did she learn the true altitude of the mountains . Perhaps it was the comparative closeness of the walls that deceived people . They reared straight up , sheer , so smooth after the first 305 meters that they were unscalable . Often they were thicker at the top than at the bottom , presenting an overhang that would daunt any would-be climber even if he had steel pitons . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew . At the top , the width of the mountains averaged 403 meters or a little more than a quarter of a mile . Yet that relatively small thickness of hard rock was impenetrable without steel tools and dynamite . It would be possible to sail north up The River until it curved for one of its southward travels . There , with enough drilling and blasting equipment , a hole could be bored through the mountain wall . But who knew what invulnerable ranges lay behind that ? The Parseval had bucked the northeasterly surface winds of the equatorialzone . Passing through the horse latitudes , it had picked up the tailwinds of the temperate latitudes . In twenty-four hours it had traveled approximately a distance equal to that from Mexico City to the lower end of Hudson Bay , Canada . Before the second day was over , it would run into headwinds from the arctic region . Just how strong these would be was not known . However , the winds here seldom matched the winds of Earth because of the lack of differential between land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley width between the equatorial and temperate zones was apparent . The mountains were generally higher and the valleys narrower in the hotter region . The narrowness of the valleys and the height of the mountains madep256for conditions comparable to those in the glens of Scotland . Generally , it rained every day about 15:00 hours or 3 P.M. in the temperate areas . Usually , a thunderstorm accompanied by rain occurred about 03:00 hours or 3 A.M. in the equatorial zone . This was not a natural phenomenon in the tropics or at least it was believed that it was not . The Parolando scientists suspected that some sort of rain-making machines concealed in the mountains caused this on-schedule precipitation . The energy requirements for this would be enormous , colossal , in fact . But beings who could remake this planet into one Rivervalley , who could provide an estimated thirty-six billion people with three meals a day through energy-matter conversion , could undoubtedly shape the daily weather . What was the energy source ? No one knew , but the best suspect was the heat of the planet 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shield lay between the crust of the earth and the deeper layers . That there was no volcanic activity or earthquakes tended to strengthen this hypothesis . Since there were no vast ice or water masses making a temperature differential comparable to that of Earth , the wind conditions could have been different . But , so far , the pattern seemed to be Terrestrial . Firebrass decided to take the ship down to 3600 meters altitude , a little over 12,000 feet . Perhaps the wind there might be weaker . The mountaintops were only 610 meters or about 2000 feet below the vessel , and the effect of the up- and downdrafts were strong at this time of the day . But the ability to change the angle of the propellers swiftly compensated somewhat for this roller-coaster motion . The ground speed increased . Before 15:00 , Firebrass ordered that the vessel be taken up above the rainclouds . He brought it back down at 16:00 , and the Parseval rode majestically above the valleys . As the sun descended , both the horizontal and vertical winds would weaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evenly . When night came , the hydrogen in the cells would cool , and the vessel would have to lift its nose even higher to give it more dynamic lift to compensate for the loss of buoyancy . The pressurized control room was warmed by electric heaters . Its occupants were , however , in hea vy cloths . Firebrass and Piscator were smoking cigars ; most of the others , cigarettes . The fans sucked the smoke away but not quickly enough to remove the cigar odor which Jill so detested . Hydrogen-emission detectors placed by the gas cells would transmit ap257warning if there were any leaks . Nevertheless , smoking was permitted only in five areas : the control gondola or bridge , a room halfway along the vessel 's axis , the auxiliary control room in the lower tail fin , and rooms attached to the quarters of the crew fore and aft . Barry Thorn , first officer of the tail section , reported some magnetic readings . According to this , the North Pole of The Riverworld coincided with the north magnetic pole . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , so slight , in fact , that it would have been undetectable without the use of instruments known only in the late 1970 's . " Which means , " Firebrass said , laughing , " that there are three poles on one spot . The North Pole , the magnetic pole , and the tower . Now , if only one of our crew was a Pole , we could have four on the same place . " Radio reception was excellent today . The ship was high above the mountains , and the transceiver of the Mark Twain was carried by a balloon towed by the boat . Aukuso said , " You can talk now , sir . " Firebrass sat down by the Samoan 's side and said , " Firebrass here , Sam . We just got word from Greystock . He 's on the way , heading northeastward , ready to alter course the moment he gets wind of the location of the Rex . " " In some ways I hope you do n't find Rotten John , " Sam said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so have the pleasure of sinking him myself . That 's not a very practical attitude , though it 's mighty satisfying . I 'm not a vindictive man , Milt , but that hyena would make St. Francis himself long to kick him off a cliff . " " The Minerva 's carrying four forty-six-kilogram bombs and six rockets with nine-kilogram warheads , " Firebrass said . " If only two of the bombs make a direct hit , they could sink the boat . " " Even so , that royal thief might get away safe and sound to shore , " Clemens said . " He has all the good luck of the wicked . How would I ever find him then ? No , I . want to see his body . Or if he 's taken alive , I want to wring his neck myself . " I ) e Bergerac spoke softly to Jill . " Clemens talks big for a man who 's appalled by violence . It 's easy to do as long as the enemy 's sixty thousand kilometers away . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't twist his head off , Sam , Joe 's the man to do the job . " An unhumanly deep voice rumbled , " No , I 'll tear off hith armth and Irgth . Then Tham can turn hith head around tho he can thee vhere he'th been . He vo n't like where he'th going . "  | " Tear off an ear for me , " Firebrass said . " Old John almost hit me when he shot at me . " Jill presumed that he was referring to the fight aboard the Not For Hire when John had seized it . Firebrass said , " According to calculations , the Rex should be in the area we 'll be over in about an hour . You should be in the same area but about one hundred forty kilometers to the west of the Rex . Of course , we could be way off . For all we know , the Rex may not be traveling as fast as it could , or King John could 've decided to dock for repairs or a very long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clemens talked to some of the crew , mostly those he had known before he 'd left Parolando . She noticed that he did not ask to speak to de Bergerac . Just as Sam was about to sign off , the radar operator reported that the Rex Grandissimus was on the scope . STAYING AT 452 METERS ALTITUDE , THE Parseval CIRCLED THE BOAT . FROMthat height it looked like a toy , but photographs , quickly enlarged , showed that it was indeed King John 's vessel . It was magnificent . Jill thought that it would be a shame to destroy such a beautiful craft , but she did not say so . Firebrass and de Bergerac felt very strongly about the man who had hijacked their fabulous Riverboat . Aukuso transmitted the location to Greystock , who said that the Minerva should reach the Rex the following day . He also checked the location of the Mark Twain . " I 'd like to fly over her so that Sam can get a good look at the ship that 's going to sink the Rex , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your way to do that , " Firebrass said . " And it 'll give Sam a big thrill . " After he had quit talking to Clemens , Firebrass said , " I really think Greystock 's on a suicide mission . The Rex is loaded with rockets , and it carries two planes armed with rockets and machine guns . It all depends on whether or not Greystock can catch the Rex by surprise . Not muchp259chance of that if John 's radar detects the Minerva . Of course , it might be off . Why should it be on ? The sonar is good enough for daytime navigation . " " Yes , " Piscator said . " But the people on the Rex must have seen us . They 'll be wondering about us , though they wo n't know who we are , and they might start using the radar because they 'll be suspicious . " " I think so , too , " Jill said . " They can figure out easily enough that only Parolando could build a dirigible . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the Minerva gets to the Rex , we 'll be behind the polar mountains . I do n't think we can expect good radio reception there . We 'll have to wait until we come back over them . " Firebrass looked thoughtful , as if he were wondering if the Parseval would return . The sun sank behind the ground horizon , though at this altitude the sky remained bright for a long time . Finally , night came with its blazing star clouds and gas sheets . Jill talked for a few minutes with Anna Obrenova before going to her cabin . The little Russian seemed warm enough , but there was something in her manner which indicated that she was not at ease . Was she really resentful because she had not been given the first mate 's position ? Before going to her quarters , Jill took a long walk through the semipressurized passageway to the tail section . Here she drank some coffee and chatted briefly with some of the officers . Barry Thorn was present , but he , too , seemed a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought , he was still unhappy at being rejected by Obrenova . If , indeed , that had been the cause of their argument . At that moment , she was reminded that the two had spoken in a language unknown to her . Now was not the time to ask him about that . It was possible she might never be able to bring up the subject . To do so would be to admit that she had been eavesdropping . On the other hand , she was very curious . Some day , when there were not more pressing things to consider , she would ask him about it . She could claim that she just happened to walk by  --  which was the truth  --  and had heard a few words of the dialog . After all , if she did not understand what they were saying , she could not be eavesdropping , could she ? She went to her cabin , where she crawled into the bunk and went to sleep almost at once . At 04:00 hours a whistle from the intercom awoke her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the third mate . He stood around a while , talking about his experiences as commander of the LZ-1 , then left . Jill did not have much to do , since Piscator was a veryp260competent pilot and the atmospheric conditions were normal . In fact , the Japanese had set the automatic controls on , though he kept a close watch on the indicator panel . There were two others present , the radio and the radar operators . " We should see the mountains at about 23:00 , " she said . Piscator wondered aloud if they were as high as Joe Miller had estimated . The titanthrop had guessed them to be about 6096 meters or 20,000 feet . Joe , however , was not a good judge of distances , or , at least , not good at converting distances into metrics or the English system . " We 'll know when we get there , " Jill said . " I wonder if the mysterious occupants of the tower will allow us to return ? " he said . " Or even to enter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous ones . Jill did not comment . " Perhaps , though , " Piscator said , " they may allow us to survey it . " Jill lit a cigarette . She did not feel nervous now , but she knew that , when they were close to the mountains , she was going to be at least a little spooked . They would be entering the forbidden , the tabu , the area of the Castle Perilous . Piscator , smiling , his black eyes shining , said , " Have you ever considered the possibility that some of Them might be on this ship ? " Jill almost strangled as she sharply drew in cigarette smoke . When shewas through coughing , she said , wheezing , " What in hell do you mean ? " " They could have agents among us . " " What makes you think that ? " " It 's just an idea , " he said . " After all , is n't it reasonable to believe that They would be watching us ? " " I think you have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? It wo n't hurt to tell me . " " It 's just an idle speculation . " " In this idle speculation , as you call it , is there someone you think could be one of Them ? " " It would n't be discreet to say so , even if there was someone . I would n't want to point the finger at a possibly innocent party . " " You do n't suspect me ? " " Would I be stupid enough to tell you if I did ? No , I am just thinking aloud . A most regrettable habit , one which I should rid myself of . " " I do n't remember you ever thinking aloud before . " She did not pursue the subject , since Piscator made it evident he was not going to add anything . The rest of the watch she tried to think ofp261what he might have observed and then put together to make a pattern . The effort left her head buzzing , and she went back to bed feeling very frustrated . Perhaps he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only two minutes short of the time she had predicted , the tops of the polar mountains were sighted . They looked like clouds , but radar gave a true picture . They were mountains . Rather , it was one continuous mountain wall circling the sea . Firebrass , reading its indicated height , groaned . " It 's 9753 meters high ! That 's taller than Mount Everest ! " There was good reason for him to groan and the others to look disturbed . The airship could not go higher than 9144 meters , and Firebrass would hesitate to take it to that altitude . Theoretically , that was the pressure height of the gas cells . To go above that meant that the automatic valves on top of the cells would release hydrogen . If they did not do so , the cells would explode , having reached their inflation limit . Firebrass would not like to take the vessel near the pressure height . An unexpectedly warm layer of air could cause the hydrogen in the cells to expand even more , thus making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Parseval would rise swiftly . The pilot would have to act swiftly , pointing the vessel 's nose down and also tilting the propellers to give a downward drive . If this maneuver failed , the gas , expanding under the lessened atmospheric pressure , would stretch the cell walls to the rupture point . Even if the ship got through this situation , its loss of valved-off gas would mean that it would become heavy . The only way to lighten the ship would be to discharge ballast . If too much ballast was dropped , the Parseval would be too buoyant . Firebrass said , " If it 's like this all the way around , we 're screwed . But Jae said ... " Ile stood for a moment , thinking , watching the dark , ominous mass gradually swell . Below them the Valley wriggled snakily , eternally covered with fog in this cold area . They had long ago passed the last of the double line of grailstones . Yet the radar and the infrared equipment showed that thick , high vegetation grew on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flourish in the cold mists ? Firebrass said , " Take her down to 3050 meters , Cyrano . I want to get a wsxl look at the headwaters . " By " look " he meant a radar view . No one could see through the massive , boiling clouds covering the mighty hole at the base of the mountains . But radar showed a colossal exit for The River , an opening 4.9p262kilometers or a little over 3 miles wide . The highest point of the arch was 35 kilometers . The mighty flood rushed straight for 3 kilometers , then tumbled over the edge of a cliff and fell straight for 915 meters , over 3000 feet . " Joe may have been exaggerating when he said you could float the moon on The River where it comes out of the cave , " Firebrass said , " but it is impressive ! " " Yes , " Cyrano said , " it is indeed grand . But the air here is almighty rough . " Firebrass ordered the Parseval to a higher altitude and on a course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kilometers . Cyrano had to crab the dirigible and swivel the propellers to keep from being blown south , and it crept alongside the towering range . Meanwhile , the radio operator tried to get into contact with the Mark Twain . " Keep it up , " Firebrass said . " Sam 'll want to know how we 're doing . And I 'm interested in finding out how the Minerva made out . " To the others he said , " I 'm looking for that gap in the mountains . There has to be one . Joe said the sun momentarily flashed through a hole or what he thought was a hole . He could n't see the break , but since the sun never gets more than halfway up the horizon here , it could n't shine inside the sea unless there 's a break that starts at ground level . Jill wondered why They would have erected such a mighty barrier only to leave an opening . At 15:05 , radar reported that there was a break in the verticality . Now the airship was over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the continuous process surrounding the sea but were peaks , some of which reached 3040 meters . Then , as they came closer to the break , they saw that between the lesser mountains and the wall was an immense valley . " A veritable Grand Canyon , as you have described it to me , " Cyrano said . " A colossal chasm . No one could get down its walls unless he used a rope 610 meters long . Nor could he ever get up the other wall . It is of the same altitude and its sides are as smooth as my mistress ' bottom . " On the other side of the lesser mountains reared the mountain that walled The River . If a man could get over the nearer height and out of the Valley , he would then have to cross a rugged precipitous range for 81 kilometers or over 50 miles . After which , he would be confronted by the uncrossable valley . " Ginnungagap , " Jill said.  | " What ? " Firebrass said . " From Norse mythology . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , the ancestor of the evil race of giants , was born . " Firebrass snorted , and said , " Next you 'll be telling me that the sea is populated by demons . " Firebrass looked cool enough , but she thought that this was a facade . Unless he had superhuman nerves , his body was under stress , the juices of the adrenals pouring out , his blood pressure up . Was he also thinking , as she was , that a much more experienced pilot should be at the controls ? The Frenchman 's judgment and reflexes were probably swifter than anybody else 's . They had been tested scores of times in simulated emergencies during training . But  --  he just did not have thousands of hours of airship travel under Terrestrial , that is , swiftly changing , conditions . So far , the voyage had been uneventful . But the polar environment was unknown , and passing over these mountains might bring the ship into sudden unexpected forces . Not might . Would . Here at the top of the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colder . The River emptied into the polar sea on the other side of the circular range where it gave up the heat remaining after thousands of kilometers of wandering through the arctic region . The contact of cold air with warm waters caused the fog reported by Joe Miller . Even so , the air was relatively colder than that outside the mountains . The high-pressure cold air inside the ring of mountains would flow outward . Joe had described the wind that howled through the passes . She wanted desperately to ask Firebrass to replace Cyrano with her . Or with Anna or Barry Thom , the only other persons with much experience . Both were , objectively considered , as good as she . But she wanted to be in control . Only then would she feel at ease . Or as much at ease as the situation allowed . Firebrass might have been of the same opinion . If so , he was not going to act on it , just as she was not going to express it . An unwritten , in fact , unspoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To order him to give it up for a more qualified pilot would humiliate him . It would show a lack of confidence , make him seem to be less a " man . " Ridiculous . Absolutely ridiculous . The entire mission and one hundred lives were at stake . Despite which , she would have said nothing even if she had thought she might be needed . Like the others , she was bound by the code . Never mind how antisurvival it was . She could not shame Cyrano . Besides , for her to suggest that he be replaced would shame her , too.  |p264Now  they were opposite the gap . It was not the V-shaped notch they had expected . It was a perfect circle cut into the mountain wall , a hole 3 kilometers across and 1000 meters above the base . From it sped clouds , driven by a wind which , if they could have heard it , would be " howling . " Cyrano was forced to point the dirigible directly into the hole to keep it from being blown southward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Parseval could advance into it at only 16 km/ph or less than 10 mph . " What a wind ! " Firebrass said . He hesitated . The air flowing down from the top of the mountain would add its force to that streaming through the hole . And the pilot would have to rely on radar to sense the nearness of the sides of the hole . " If the mountains are n't any thicker than they are along The River , " Firebrass said , " we can get through the hole faster than a dog through a hoop . However ... " He bit down on his cigar , then said through clenched teeth , " Let 's take her through the gates of hell ! " 46CONVERGENCE OF PATHS THROUGH CHANCE FASCINATED PETER FRIGATE . Pure chance had brought his in potentio into essens . His father was born and brought up in Terre Haute , Indiana ; his mother , in Galena , Kansas . Not much chance for them to get together and beget Peter Jairus Frigate , right ? Especially in 1918 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the handsome , affluent , gambling , womanizing , boozing William Frigate , was forced to take a business trip to Kansas City , Missouri . He thought his eldest son , James , should learn the details of handling his various interests throughout the Midwest . So he took the twenty-year-old along . Instead of driving in the new Packard , they took the train . Peter 's mother was in Kansas City , living with her German relatives while she attended a business school . The Hoosier and the Jayhawk had never heard of each other . They had nothing in common except beingp265human and living in the Midwest , an area larger than many European countries . And so , one hot afternoon , his mother-to-be had gone to a drugstore for a sandwich and a milkshake . His father-to-be had gotten bored listening to a business conference between his father and a farm machinery manufacturer . When lunch hour came , the two older men had headed for a saloon . James , not wanting to start boozing so early , had gone into the drugstore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice cream and vanilla extract and chocolate , the swishing of two big overhead fans , a view of the long marble counter , magazines on a rack , and three pretty girls sitting on wire chairs around a small marble-topped table . He eyed them , as would any man , young or old . He sat down and ordered a chocolate soda and a ham sandwich , then he decided he 'd look the magazine rack over . He leafed through some magazines and a paperback fantasy about time travel . He did n't care much about such romances . I le 'd tried H.G. Wells , Jules Verne , H. Rider Haggard , and Frank Reade , Jr . but his hard Hoosier head rejected such implausibilities . On the way back , just as he passed the table at which the three giggling girls sat , he had to leap to one side to avoid a glassful of Coke . One of the girls , waving her hand while telling a story , had knocked it off . If he had n't been so agile , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his shoe was stained . The girl apologized . James told her that there was nothing to be concerned about . He introduced himself and asked if he could sit with them . The girls were eager to talk to a good-looking young man from the faraway state of Indiana . One thing led to another . Before the girls had gone back to the nearby school , he had arranged a date with " Teddy " Griffiths . She was the quietest of the trio and not quite the best looking , but there was something about the slim girl with the Teutonic features , the Indian-straight , Indian-black hair , and large dark-brown eyes that attracted him . Elective affinity , Peter Frigate called it , not above borrowing a phrase from Goethe . Courting in those days was not as free and easy as in Peter 's day . James had to go to the Kaiser residence on Locust Street , a long trip by . streetcar , and be introduced to her uncle and aunt . Then they sat on the front porch with the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight o'clock , he and Teddy went for a walk around the block , talking of this and that . On returning , he thanked her relatives for their hospitality and said goodbye to Teddy without kissing her . But theyp266corresponded , and , two months later , James made another trip , this time in one of his father 's cars . And this time they did a little spooning , mostly in the back row of the local movie house . On his third trip , he married Teddy . They left immediately after the wedding to take the train to Terre Haute . James was fond of telling his eldest son that he should have named him Pullman . " You were conceived on a train , Pete , so I thought it would be nice if your name commemoratedthat event , but your mother would n't have it . " Peter did n't know whether or not to believe his father . He was such a kidder . Besides , he could n't see his mother arguing with his father . James was a little man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a domestic Napoleon . This was the concatenation of events that had slid Peter Jairus Frigate from potentiality into existence . If old William had not decided to take his son along to Kansas City , if James had not been more tempted by a soda than by beer , if the girl had n't happened to knock over the Coke , there would have been no Peter Jairus Frigate . At least , not the individual now bearing that name . And if his father had had a wet dream the night before or had used a contraceptive on the wedding night , he , Peter , would not have been born . Or if there had been no mating , if it had been put off for some reason , the egg would have drifted off and out and into a menstruation pad . What was there about that one spermatozoan , one in 300,000,000 , that had enabled it to beat all the others out in the race to the egg ? May the best wriggler win . And so it had been . But it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . And then there was the horde of his brothers and sisters in potentio , unhoarded . They had died , arriving too late or not at all . A waste of flesh and spirit . Had any of the sperm had the potentiality for his imagination and writing talent ? Or were those in the egg ? Or were they in the fusion of sperm and egg , a combination of genes only possible in that one sperm and that one egg ? His three brothers had no creative and little passive imagination ; his sister had a passive imagination , she liked fantasy and science fiction , but she had no inclination to write . What had made the difference ? Environment could n't explain it . The others had been exposed to the same influences as he . His father had purchased that library of little red pseudoleather-bound books , what in hell was its name ? It was a very popular home library in his childhood . But they had n't been fascinated by the stories in them . They had n't fallen in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bohemia , or sympathized with the monsterp267in Frankenstein , or battled before the walls of Troy with Achilles , or suffered with Odysseus in his wanderings , or descended the icy depths to seek out Grendel with Beowulf , or journeyed with the Time Traveller of Wells , or visited those wild weird stars of Olive Schneider , or escaped from the Mohegans with Natty Bumppo . Nor had they been interested in the other books his parents bought him , Pilgrim 's Progress , Tom Sawyer and Ilucklebery Finn , Treasure Island , The Arabian Nights , and Gulliver 's Travels . Nor had they prospected at the little library branch , where he first dug the gold of Frank Baum , Hans Andersen , Andrew Lang , Jack London , A. Conan Doyle , Edgar Rice Burroughs , Rudyard Kipling , and H. Rider Haggard . And do n't forget the lesser , the silver , ore : Irving Crump , A.G. llenty , Roy Rockwood , Oliver Curwood , Jeffrey Farnol , Robert Service , Anthony Hope , and A. Hyatt Verrill . After all , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rassendyll ranked almost with Tarzan , John Carter of Barsoom , Dorothy Gale of Oz , ' Odysseus , Holmes and Challenger , Jim Hawkins , Ayesha , Allan Quartermain and Umslopogaas . It tickled Peter at this moment to think that he was on the same boat with the man who had furnished the model for the fictional Umslopogaas . And he was also a deckhand for the man who had created Buck and White Fang , Wolf Larsen , the nameless subhuman narrator of Beyond Adam , and Smoke Bellew . It delighted him also that he talked daily with the great Tom Mix , unequaled in cinema flair and fantastic adventure except by Douglas Fairbanks , Senior . If only Fairbanks were aboard . But then it would also be delightful to have Doyle and Twain and Cervantes and Burton , especially Burton , aboard . And ... The boat sure was getting crowded . Be satisfied . But then he never was . What had he drifted off from ? Oh , yes . Chance , another word for destiny . Ile did n't believe , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were rigidly predetermined . " From the time when the first atom of the great Laurentian sea bumped into the second atom , our fates were fixed . " Twain had said something like that , probably in his depressing What Is Man ? That philosophy was an excuse for escaping guilt . Ducking responsibility . Nor did he believe , as had Kurt Vonnegut , the late-twentieth-century avatar of Mark Twain , that we were governed entirely by the chemical makeup of our bodies . God was n't the Great Garage Mechanic in the Sky or the Divine Pill Pusher . If there was a God . Frigate did n't know what God was and often doubted that He existed . God might not exist , but free will did . True , it was a limited force ,  |p268re|pressed  or influenced by environmental conditioning , chemicals , brain injuries , neural diseases , lobotomy . But a human being was not just a protein robot . No robot could change its mind , decide on its own to reprogram itself , lift itself by its mental bootstraps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and these did determine to some extent our intellect , aptitudes , leanings , reactions , in short , our characters . Character determines destiny , according to the old Greek , Heraclitus . But a person could change his/her character . Somewherein there was a force , an entity , that said , " I wo n't do it ! " Or  --  " Nobody 's going to stop me from doing it ! " Or  --  " I 've been a coward but this time I 'm a raging lion ! " Sometimes you needed an outside stimulus or stimulator , as had the Tin Woodsman and the Scarecrow and the Cowardly Lion . But the Wizard only gave them what they had had all the time . The brains of mixed sawdust , bran , pins and needles , the silk sawdust-stuffed heart , and the liquid from the square green bottle marked Courage were only antiplacebos . By thought you could change your emotional attitudes . Frigate believed that , though his practice had never matched his theory . He 'd been reared in a Christian Scientist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sent him to a Presbyterian church , since they were having a fit of religious apathy then . His mother cleaned up the kitchen and took care of the babies Sunday mornings while his father read The Chicago Tribune . Like it or not , he went off to Sunday School and then the sermon . So , he had gotten two contrary religious educations . One believed in free will , in evil and matter as illusion , in Spirit as the only reality . The other believed in predestination . God picked out a few here and there for salvation and let the others go to hell . No rhyme or reason to this . You could n't do a thing to change that . Once the divine choice had been made , it was done . You could live purely , agonizedly praying and hoping all your life . But when the end of life on Earth came , you went to your appointed place . The sheep , those whom God for some unexplainablereason had marked with His grace , went up to sit on His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious reasons , slid down the prearranged chute into the fire , sinner and saint alike . When he was twelve , he had had many nightmares in which Mary Baker Eddy and John Calvin had fought for his soul . It was no wonder , when he was fourteen , that he had decided to blazesp269with both faiths . With all faiths . Still , he had been the epitome of the prudish puritan . No foul words escaped his lips ; he blushed if told a dirty joke . He could n't stand the odors of beer or whiskey , and even if he 'd liked them , he would have rejected them with scorn . And he 'd have luxuriated in a feeling of moral superiority for doing so . His early puberty was a torment . In the seventh grade he would be called on to stand up and recite , his face red , his penis thrusting against his fly , having risen at the trumpet call of his teacher 's large breasts . Nobody seemed to notice , but he was sure every time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he accompanied his parents to a movie in which the heroine wore a low-cut dress or displayed a flash of garter , he put his hand on his pants to hide the swelling . The flickering light from the screen would reveal his sin . His parents would know what his thoughts were , and they would be horrified . He 'd be ashamed to look in their faces forever after . Twice , his father talked to him about sex . Once , when he was twelve . Apparently , his mother had noticed some blood on his bath towel and spoken to his father . James Frigate , with a good deal of hemming and hawing and a twisted grin , had asked him if he was masturbating . Peter was both horrified and indignant . He had denied it , though his father acted as if he really did not believe him . Investigation revealed , however , that , when bathing , Peter had not been feeling back his foreskin to wash under it . He had not wanted to touch his penis . As a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How this could cause a bleeding neither he nor his father knew . But he was advised to wash thoroughly every time he took a bath . Also , he was told that jacking-off rotted the brain , and he was given the example of the village idiot of North Terre Haute , a boy who publicly masturbated . With a grave face , his father told him that anybody who jerked off would become a drooling imbecile . Maybe his father believed that . So many of his generation did . Or maybe he 'd just passed on that horrifying tale , purveyed for only God knew how many centuries or even millennia , to is are his son . Peter would find out that that was superstition , a reasoning from effect to cause , totally invalid . It was in a class with the belief that if you ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich while you were sitting in the outhouse , thr devil would get you . Peter had n't lied . He had not been indulging in the sin of Onan . Though why it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't masturbated . Onan had just used what Peter overheard his father
