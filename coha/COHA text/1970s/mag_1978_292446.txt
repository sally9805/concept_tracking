Huxleian World <P> To the Editors : <P> In all fairness to Gilbert and Lesley Brown , let 's stop treating their new baby daughter as a medical oddity . Like every child ever conceived and born , the so-called test-tube baby July 31 spent about nine months in utero and entered the world in a manner acceptable to society and medicine . Louise Brown was conceived in a Petri dish , not a test tube , and she developed and was born from within her natural mother 's womb . To herald this girl as a test-tube baby only perpetuates the myth that we are entering a Huxleian world of callous indifference to childbirth and motherhood . It 's a glorious day for women afflicted with the type of sterility Mrs. Brown has overcome . <P> Stuart Kunkler <P> Columbus <P> While Dr. Steptoe may be applauded in scientific circles for his work in helping Mrs. Brown achieve pregnancy and normal delivery , his performing multiple abortions-that is , destroying pregnancy and life-takes much of the glamour from his achievement . <P> James T. Murphy , M.D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detected irony in the fact that Drs . Steptoe and Edwards financed the research that culminated in the birth of the first test-tube baby by doing legal abortions . In fact , the two activities spring from the same basic belief : that parenthood should be a matter of choice . <P> Margaret Wood <P> Milan , N.H. <P> By turning the birth of their child into a media event , the Browns have most probably guaranteed that their child , whom they so desperately wanted , will never have a chance at a normal childhood or even adulthood . They have degraded and institutionalized the child , and for that act , not for their act of medically assisted birth , the Browns should be viewed as symbols of the degeneration of Western morals . <P> Grant Parsons <P> Ann Arbor , Mich . <P> <P> Cambodian Experiment <P> Hats off to David Aikman July 31 , who has the clarity of mind , the moral sense and the courage to expose the blind cruelty of Marxism when that atheistic , deterministic system runs its course unrestrained by Christian principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Something is so grotesquely out of focus that I am in a state of awed disbelief . It is in the birth of one child and the slaughter of millions that an imbalance seems to make a mockery of humaneness . <P> Such a development of a child is of course newsworthy ; but when we are told about the destruction of 1 million lives we turn the page and sigh , " They are at it again . " No outrage , no days of prayer in churches , no outcries from protesters - nothing . <P> One child was awaited with great anticipation . Heaven 's gates alone heard the stampeding of the million . <P> Ellen J. Marinucci <P> Houston <P> The statement that the situation in Cambodia is " the deadly logical consequence of an atheistic " system of values suggests that theistic value systems have never allowed or encouraged such atrocities . One need only cite the brutalities committed in the name of God , from the Inquisition to the " Kill a Commie for Christ " mentality , to demonstrate that intolerance , bigotry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more common to " religiously oriented " societies than to the few genuinely secular ones . <P> James Anding <P> Waterloo , Ont . <P>
