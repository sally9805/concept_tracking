Corps Delicti <P> Sir / The incredibly inhumane ostracism leveled against Cadet Pelosi by fellow West Pointers June 18 has answered my question of whence originated the inhumane treatment of some Vietnamese . The whole academy class should be tested psychologically to detect dormant sadism that might result in future Viet Nams . <P> <P> JOSEPH M. GALEOTA <P> Mount Rainier , Md . <P> Sir / What we admittedly biased West Point graduates know are two facts : first , that although the honor system , like any legal machinery designed to protect specific ideals , has now , as in the past , imperfections , nevertheless it belongs entirely to its proper subjects , the corps of cadets , who are constantly concerned with its equitable and just operation ; and , second , that the honor code which that system serves has given to us all one of the most precious gifts of our lives -a mutual respect based entirely upon the shared notion of the ineffable power of a man 's integrity . <P> <P> THOMAS H. JOHNSON <P> Walnut Creek , Calif . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of West Point graduates should be dismissed from the Army immediately . <P> <P> R.F. MUNZENRIDER <P> Gainesville , Fla . <P> Sir / I ca n't believe it . What a bunch of self-righteous brats . <P> <P> MARY ANNE HOWE POSNANSKI <P> Milwaukee Sir / It is devoutly to be hoped that the self-righteous members of the cadet honor committee will , as officers , maintain the same rigid standards for themselves-an honor system that has some meaning in their military careers . That includes extreme honesty in the efficiency reports they dole out to others whom they command , and precludes deals with medical officers who will determine their " disabilities " at retirement in order to qualify them for tax-free pensions . <P> <P> M.V. NEWMAN <P> Arlington , Va . <P> <P> Untrue Grit ? <P> <P> Sir / I 've just read your People item June 18 about my recent return from China and was amazed to find I 've turned into John Wayne . <P> From overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic comments , you chose to excerpt out of context a quote critical of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discredit this extraordinary country . <P> <P> CANDICE BERGEN <P> New York City <P> Domestic Gravediggers <P> Sir / Your cover on the dollar June 18 was very impressive , but it gives the impression that foreign countries are destroying the mighty dollar while Washington tries to defend it . <P> Who flooded the world with dollars , beginning with the Marshall Plan , followed by foreign aid , overseas bases and American investments abroad-all to the tune of untold hundreds of billions of dollars ? <P> Much could be done with the dollar domestically to benefit this country-and other countries of the world , by leaving them alone to solve their own problems . It seems to me that your cover picture failed to show the principal gravediggers for the dollar . <P> <P> PETER LANGE <P> Topeka , Kans . <P> Sir / I think you should put the shoe on the correct foot . Until the American public decides to change its ways of spending its dollars , it can not be called " Nixon 's crisis " - it must be labeled " America 's crisis .
