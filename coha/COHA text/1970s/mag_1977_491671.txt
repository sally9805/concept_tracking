I was born on February 3 , 1894 , in a shabby brownstone-front house on 103rd Street and Amsterdam Avenue in New York City . My family moved to an apartment on 147th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue when I was two years old . It was narrow and gloomy , with few windows . My father had to carry coal for our two stoves up four flights from the basement . But the flat was uptown from 103rd Street and , in those days , that meant we had risen in the world . When I enrolled at the National Acade  --  my School of Fine Arts I was 16 years old . In the morning at art school we studied the work of the great illustrators . Thomas Fogarty , who taught the class , was slim , polite and practical about teaching . One day he found me sitting alone in the lunchroom at the League , staring listlessly at my coffee cup . He asked if anything was wrong . " I just do n't seem to be getting any  --  where , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked . I told him I was 17 and three quarters . He laughed , and tipped me off that the Paulist Fathers on 59th Street needed a few drawings for a Christmas booklet  --  Santa Clauses , angels , cherubs with trum  --  pets . After I did that job , Mr. Fogarty steered me to others . I had a secret ambition:a cover on The Saturday Evening Post . The cover of the Post was the greatest show window in America for an illustrator . One day , as I was mentally rolling on my cot in the flophouse , my friend Clyde asked what I was muttering about . I told him . " Why do n't you do a cover and show it to them ? " I set to work the next morning on a painting of a handsome Gibson man in white tie and tails , leaning over the back of a sofa to kiss a gorgeous Gibson girl in evening dress . The next day I left that painting to start another : a beautiful bal  --  lerina curtsying in the glare of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them near  --  ly finished . I was pretty well pleased with myself . " They 're terrible , " said Clyde . " You ca n't do a beautiful , seductive woman . Give it up . " He grabbed one of the illus  --  trations I had just completed for a story in Boy 's Life . " Do that , " said Clyde . " Do what you 're best at . Kids . Just adapt it to the Post . " Norman Rockwell So I called in model Billy Paine and set to work . I thought up six or seven ideas : two boys in baseball uniforms scoffing at another boy who was dressed in his Sun  --  day suit and pushing a baby carriage ; a kid 's circus , one kid in long underwear as a strong man , another in a top hat as bark  --  er , and so on . I made finished paintings in black , white and red of two of the ideas and rough sketches of three others . Meanwhile , I 'd been making other prep  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of The Saturday Evening Post . I bought a new suit , a gray herringbone tweed , I remember , and a new hat , a con  --  servative black one . Usually when I went to see an editor I tied up my paintings and sketches with brown paper and twine . It made a neat package , but after I 'd shown my work I had to rewrap , and while I struggled with the pictures , paper and string , the editor would have to wait , making ex  --  asperated attempts to help me . I felt it would be bad busi  --  ness to keep the great Mr. Lorimer waiting ; I wanted everything to go smoothly . So I went to a harness maker in New Rochelle and asked him to make me a suitcase . " I want it big , " I told him , " about thirty by forty inches and a foot thick . And inconspicuous ; I guess black would be best . " He followed my instructions conscientiously . The case was long , thick , tall and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was actually a grue  --  some affair , but I was satisfied . So one cold morning in March of 1916 I set out for Philadelphia and the Post . As I sidled up the broad steps of the Curtis Publishing Company building  --  white marble pillars gleaming in the sun , imposing , magnifi  --  cent  --  I felt my Adam 's apple sink beneath my collar . Maybe I 'd better work on the paintings some more . Then I thought of Clyde ? " You mean you did n't Of Rockwell 's 317 Post covers , Hibbs said Homecoming was " the greatest in history . " even go into the office ? " I asked the lobby receptionist which floor Mr. Lorimer 's office was on . Sixth . When I asked to see Mr. Lorimer , the receptionist asked my business . I explain  --  ed , and she said she 'd call Mr. Walter H. Dower , the art editor . There were two men in the reception hall . The secretary had greeted them as Mr. Cobb and Mr. Blythe . Golly , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G. Blythe , the famous writers . Pretty soon Mr. Cobb came over to where I was sitting , stared quizzically at my box , tapped it lightly with his fist , and listened intently . Then he looked at me and walked back to Mr. Blythe . They put their heads together , whispering . Mr. Blythe came over and examined my box . Finally Mr. Cobb said to me , " Young man , will you answer a question ? " " Oh , yes , Mr. Cobb , " I said . " Tell me , " he said , looking hard at my box , " is the body in there now ? " Mr. Dower took my paintings and sketches in to Mr. Lorimer and brought word back that Mr. Lorimer would accept the two finished paintings and had O.K. 'd the three sketches for future Post covers . He added that I was to receive $75 for each cover . Wow ! All my problems , I thought , were solved . I might even get married ; after all , I was n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of experience and mature judg ment . I had arrived .
