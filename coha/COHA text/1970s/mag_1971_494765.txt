Bogus Reform Campaign Funding by Walter Pincus A basic problem with campaign reform legislation - as proposed this year - is that no one has taken the trouble beforehand to lay out for the legislators and the public the actual ways in which presidential , senatorial and congressional campaigns are run . As a result , what the public is being given as disclosure reform may turn out to be next year 's loophole . And proposals designed to limit the amount of money put into campaigns may turn out to have increased the money available for use by the same candidates through other committees . One case in point is the Democrats ' proposed $1 checkoff plan for financing the 1972 presidential election campaign . In the five days of often sarcastic , sometimes bitter Senate debate that preceded passage of the measure , there was not one carefully detailed presentation of the complex manner by which such campaigns have actually been financed in the past . A Democratic National Committee official who followed the matter closely later suggested that none of the senators involved in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , would include two senators , Goldwater and Humphrey , who themselves had been presidential candidates . Failure to understand presidential campaign financing does n't stop at the doors of the Senate . I would guess there are fewer than a dozen men living today - Democrats or Republicans - who fully understand the intricate processes of loans , debts , cash , multiple committees , and contribution techniques that have supported national campaigns in the past . Among them would be Attorney General John Mitchell and Commerce Secretary Maurice Starts ( Nixon 1968 ) ; Minneapolis trucking tycoon Robert Short ( Humphrey 1968 ) ; Washington lawyer Richard Maguire ( Johnson 1964 ) ; US Ambassador to the Netherlands , J. W. Middendorf ( Goldwater 1964 ) When the time came to talk of campaign reform , although most of them spoke of the need , none ever came forward to " tell it like it was " so that legislative changes now before Congress and the President could be based on , practice rather than on assumption . Thus the public was forced to accept as true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the checkoff legislation that a presidential campaign is run and financed solely from a national headquarters . Such , however , is not the case . An American presidential campaign is a highly integrated total election effort that stretches from the national candidate 's headquarters through a myriad of party and presidential candidate state-level groups down in one form or other to the congressional districts , county , city , ward , and finally precinct levels . And the money to pay the bills for a presidential campaign goes far beyond the highly publicized reports made by the national party committees in Washington . For example , when a presidential candidate appears in New York City at Madison Square Garden , chances are some state or local organization paid for the hall , the bands , the decorations , the tickets , the ushers , the local advertising , the local television time ( if any is purchased ) , the cars for the candidate and his entourage , even the buses that brought the party supporters in from the suburbs . And when you add up the costs of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stretch , over a two-month campaign , you come up with a substantial total in just this one category of locally-assumed presidential campaign costs . In 1968 , the Nixon campaign organization reported raising some $25 million at the national headquarters level . That figure does not include expenses of Nixon-Agnew committees in every one of the 50 states . Since the total for one statewide Florida committee ran to $380,000 , one could guess that at least another $10 million nationally was involved for such " citizen " committees at the state level . The Senate-passed checkoff legislation , to which the President objects , would provide $20.4 million in federal funds to a national-party candidate who would agree not to raise any additional private contributions . Despite assurances from Democratic senatorial proponents that this sum would be all that is needed , such an amount would not be enough under today 's normal campaigning procedures to finance in its entirety a national presidential campaign . If you talk about the true nature of such a campaign to Democratic professionals , they will readily concede that additional funds would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in at the state or local levels is the only question . Already there is talk about how to evade the complete prohibition of outside funds by making a presidential candidate 's appearance part of the local candidates ' effort rather than the national presidential campaign . In several key areas - public reporting , enforcement , and limitations of unauthorized committees - the checkoff bill shows the same type of weakness that permitted the current campaign fund legislation to become " more loophole than law . " Take reporting . Although responsibility for this is given the Comptroller General , his reports on federal funds disbursed by the presidential candidates are not required by the legislation to be made public at regular periods prior to the election . The only public reports are scheduled ' for after the election and then in summary form . Enforcement shows the same type of **35;2294;TOOLONG that we have today . The Comptroller General who finds that a candidate 's party benefited from outside contributions - after saying it would accept none - must return the amount involved to the US Treasury . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President-elect or a defeated presidential candidate would be indicted or convicted in such circumstances ? Finally , the unauthorized committees supporting a candidate are not barred - out of fear of raising the constitutional freedom-of-speech issue . They are limited , however , to raising only $1000 . Such a provision will only guarantee the creation of several hundred or even thousand committees to meet whatever expenses need to be covered . These basic weaknesses are magnified by the Democrats ' promotion of the checkoff as a major answer to the publicized campaign fund problem . In a way it is too bad they have sought to oversell their product , for it has within it some practical and useful reforms . First there is the idea of a federal subsidy - but it should be one for specific limited expenses . Instead of seeking $20.4 million , which is substantially abovethe $11 million they raised with difficulty in 1968 , the Democrats should have sought a lesser amount - a sum that would guarantee them a reasonable staff , reasonable travel and communications and a basic national television exposure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have better served their own purposes and those of real reform . The reform bills that passed the Senate in August and the House last week have some of the same weaknesses in the details of their enforcement of limits and public disclosure provisions . Of course the main input to a reporting law is the manner of enforcement . If the person or persons responsible for that enforcement fail to perform , then any law becomes useless . Today neither the Clerk of the House nor the Attorney General shows any interest in enforcing the law currently on the books . As lax as is its language , there is , for example , no review for accuracy or completeness of the reports that are filed . No one has taken the responsibility to see that all present national political committees as defined in the act are in fact reporting . Under the proposed new legislation , limits on the amounts to be spent on behalf of federal candidates are made , but will not apply to so-called " unauthorized committees " - those which are established without a candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups as well as unions are moving more and more into campaign financing through just such committees , their exemption from the limitation rules opens a potentially wide loophole . The House , furthermore , would require identifying contributions of more than $100 . Big contributors , to remain anonymous , would merely have to make multiple hundred-dollar contributions . The comprehensive reporting provisions of the new legislation open up a slightly different problem . Under the proposed law , every committee in any state which raises or spends $1000 or more on federal candidates will have to file a report . Such committees could easily run into the thousands . Thus the enforcement - if you call it that - of timely disclosure will be for all practical purposes passed on to the local news media . The general lethargy of the media in seriously reporting campaign finances as part of the overall election story hopefully will change with the availability of detailed information on money in politics . Otherwise , the object of disclosure in informing the electorate before the election probably will be lost . Today 's campaign reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past . But the crescendo of charges on all sides that today 's campaign funding system is corrupt has deeply sunk into the public mind . The Republicans are well fixed and appear to have no desire to ease the financing problems that will face a Democratic nominee . Thus the checkoff proposal faces a presidential veto . ( Ironically if Mr. Nixon signed the measure and enforced its provisions on the Democratic candidate who took federal financing , the President might have a better issue . ) But the Republicans want no strict accounting made of the money they have raised or will raise next year . Time , however , is running out on the promise to reform the system . In fact , the promise and failure to pass and implement reforms may contain more danger to our political system than the ills that have been so19 publicized about the system they want to change . Thus , although the individual party stakes seem high , they do not compare to what could be lost by failure of any measure to emerge this year . Both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of these two contending party pressures is not just the proposition of campaign fund reform , but also the American public 's filth in its own political process .
