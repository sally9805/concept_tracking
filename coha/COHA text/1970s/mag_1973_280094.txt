THEATRE OF BLOOD is the giddy tale of a sugar-cured Shakespearean actor named Edward Lionheart ( Vincent Price ) who sets out to eliminate the London critics who have mocked and vilified him during his career . He kills each of them in a quite elaborate and grisly fashion , every slaughter based on a scenario provided by the Bard : one hapless critic , for example , has his heart cut out ( the pound of flesh in The Merchant of Venice ) , another is stabbed to death on the Ides of March . Worst torture of all , perhaps , is that the poor struggling wretches must listen to Lionheart declaim passages from the pertinent play before he kills them . Besides Price , who is at his most enjoyably fulsome , the large cast includes a bounty of fine British players : Diana Rigg , Ian Hendry , Milo O'Shea , Eric Sykes and , as those viperous but ill-fated critics , Harry Andrews , Coral Browne , Robert Coote , Jack Hawkins , Michael Hordern , Arthur Lowe , Robert Morley and Dennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal of the time , quite funny . It is farce as broad as Shaftesbury Avenue , but its high spirits are not entirely consistent with the great gobs of gore that Director Douglas Hickox leaves smeared about . Violence , under the circumstances , ought to have been a charade , but often it is so brutal and lingering that it spoils the joke . <P> FISTS OF FURY is such a shambles that Five Fingers of Death , the other Chinese battle hymn to Kung Fu that is currently cleaning up in the U.S. ( TIME , May 14 ) , looks by comparison like The Seven Samurai . The fights , which are plentiful but somehow lackadaisical , are all generated by the disappearance of several brothers who work down at the icehouse , where envelopes of white powder are frozen in the middle of each cake . Pressed to explain this , the plant manager says guilelessly : " There 's no profit in ice . In dope , plenty .

While they kick , chop and clobber each other , the road right beside the field of battle is fairly clogged with traffic . No one bothers to take a look , much less stops to help , an inadvertent suggestion of how quickly boredom can beset the martial arts . <P> L'AMOUR Paul Morrissey-Andy Warhol movies are always something of a stalemate . It is impossible to determine exactly who receives more contempt and abuse , the people in the movies or the ones watching them . L'Amour ( " presented " by Warhol , written and directed by Warhol and his protege Morrissey ) features the wrecking crew from The Factory , Warhol 's New York homestead , transported to Paris , where they scratch and stammer through a plot that might be a low-camp rewrite of La Ronde . Michael ( Michael Sklar ) and Max ( Max Delys ) are lovers . Michael , wanting to get married for appearances only , becomes involved with Donna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Jane ( Jane Forth ) . All have been encouraged to play someone approximating themselves , which does not mean there is any recognizable humanity to be seen . Warhol and Morrissey specialize in an especially vicious kind of ridicule , to which the actors eagerly sacrifice themselves .
