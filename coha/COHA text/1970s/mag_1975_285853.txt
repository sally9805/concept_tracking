Saigon is gradually becoming a stereotypic city under Communist control . All newspapers except those authorized by the Communist Party have been suppressed . A detailed census is being taken , presumably to facilitate supervision of all activities . Political and military officials who served under the old Thieu regime have been ordered to report to " reeducation " centers . Martial music and Communist slogans blare from street-corner loudspeakers . <P> <P> The easygoing mood that marked the first days of the Communist occupation of Saigon is quickly vanishing , according to Western observers who have recently left South Viet Nam 's capital . " The smiles of those days have faded , " says Dieter Ludwig , a West German photographer who was expelled from Saigon when the new rulers decided to reduce drastically the number of non-Communist journalists . Saigon has been plagued by a near epidemic of theft and lawlessness . At first the Communists were quite casual about patrolling the streets ; soon they began making rounds heavily armed and only in groups of at least five . Lawbreakers , when caught , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the only newspaper authorized to be published in the capital , has reported cases of soldiers capturing a thief , quickly questioning eyewitnesses , and then summarily executing the prisoner . <P> The Western-influenced life-style of Saigon has become a target of Communist ire . Blue jeans , nail polish , lipstick and miniskirts have been condemned as vestiges of the defeated capitalist society . Young men have been pressured to trim their long hair , while girls have been urged to wear " clothes that are simple and not stimulating . " As a result , more Saigon women these days are wearing the traditional slit-skirt ao-dai , which , ironically , many Westerners regarded as extremely stimulating indeed . <P> So far , there has been no evidence of the kind of violent mass reprisals that some U.S. officials predicted would accompany a Communist victory in South Viet Nam . Still , many Saigonais still fear a crackdown . Liberation Daily , in fact , may have hinted that such a terror campaign is in the offing ; a recent article noted " a popular movement to discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their puppet Saigon government . " <P> According to most reports , the administration of South Viet Nam is completely dominated by the North Vietnamese . So many bureaucrats have apparently left Hanoi for posts in the South that journalists in North Viet Nam 's capital complain that many of their best sources are now in Saigon . Despite the influx of cadres from the North , Saigon 's new rulers have problems running the city . Banks remain closed , the telephone system is hi chaos , and some offices remain unstaffed . <P> Gunfire Exchanges . Outside Saigon , the Communists also have problems . A Tass dispatch from South Viet Nam last week confirmed that there have been frequent exchanges of gunfire a few miles north of Saigon between Communist troops and holdout ARVN units . This last-ditch resistance is likely to be short-lived ; one member of an anti-Communist army group , in a letter to his family in Saigon , conceded that " we know we have no chance of winning , but we will fight anyway .
