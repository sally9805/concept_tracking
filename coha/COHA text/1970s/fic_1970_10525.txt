MILITARY PLANE crashed that winter on Mount Vesuvius . The plane had taken off from Naples in fog ; some hours afterwards , it was reported missing . The search went on for hundreds of miles around  --  over the Ionian Sea , and at Catania , at Catanzaro . Two days later , when the fog lifted , we could see the wreck quite clearly , crumbled against the snow-streaked cone of the volcano , overlooking the airfield from which it had set out . No one had thought of looking close to home . Since that time , so they say , we have developed better methods of keeping in touch . For it is twelve or fifteen years , now , since the accident took place . When I was a child I used to be filled with envy when adults recalled events of twelve or fifteen years before . I would think it must be marvellous , to issue those proclamations of experience  --  " It was at least ten years ago " or " I had n't seen him for twenty years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't be shed ; it increases moment by moment , day by day , pressing itsp4honours on you until you are lavishly , overly endowed with them . Until you literally sink under them . A centenarian has told me that memory protects one from this burden of experience . Whole segments of time dropped out , she said : " Of five or six years , say , around the turn of the century , all I can remember is the dress that someone wore , or the colour of a curtain . " And I would be pleased , rather than otherwise , at the prospect of remembering Naples in similar terms  --  a lilac dress Gioconda wore one morning driving to Caserta , or the Siena-coloured curtains of the apartment in San Biagio dei Librai . But memory , at an interval of only fifteen years , is less economical and less poetic , still clouded with effects and what seemed to be their causes . The search is still under way in unlikely places  --  too assiduous , too attenuated ; too far from home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NATO establishmentat Naples organized around the United States Sixth Fleet , with token components from other countries . When I was brought there from London to translate documents from Italian into English and to do some clerical sifting and sorting of coloured papers , there were already a number of English girls at the base doing similar things  --  Angelas and Hilarys and Rosemarys who had wanted to get away from Reading or Ruislip or Holland Park . For the most part those fugitive girls were in their twenties ; and over them hung an immanence , a palep5expectancy , as if their youth were yet to come to them . What passion they possessed for change had , in getting them to Naples , expended itself ; once there , they relapsedinto their natural obligingness . Breathlessly polite , they made among the drab or primary colours of military life their tender , uncherished strokes of pastel . My work , though much like theirs , took place in a different building ; my life , while no more nourishing , had been lived on a different continent . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a child when that took place , there was always an implication to it , if not of defection at least of something regrettable . Even my brother used to say , " Jenny spent the war in Africa , " in a way that at once apologised for and excluded me . I arrived at Naples in autumn , a belatedly inserted item on the budget of a joint mission to study docking and airport facilities with a view to extending them . With it view to extending them , for no such mission ever pronouncedthe existing state of affairs to be adequate . The airfield  --  the same airfield that lay to the south , at the foot of the volcano , far from our offices  --  was to be , for example , enlarged to receive jet planes , which were tootling into military use then . In addition , there were rockets , there were higher and higher explosives , there was the prospect of the nuclear submarine . Even in IAmdon , where over translations of preliminary papers I learnt the terms I had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibilities shouldp6have devolved on Naples . Ignorant of the Mediterranean , hesitantly speaking an Italian sporadically acquired in Somaliland , I prepared to take the city 's part with the loyalty of the native-born . Our offices were part of a modern complex at Bagnoli , on the northern outskirts of Naples . Modern , I say , but the buildings now have dated in a remarkable way : it is their characterlessness that identifies them , and their resolute unawareness of place . In and around these buildingsthousands of NATO personnel and their families lived out their term of exile , requiring nothing of Italy or its language , passing among themselves stale , trumpery talismans of home , recreating a former existence from the shelves of the PX until such time as they should  --  on other , equally alien shores  --  speak with nostalgia and authority of the Bay of Naples . Having arrived with the advance segment of the mission , I was installed along with them  --  by one of those errors that are the mark of the highly organized  --  into a hotel in Naples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was error , then , that set me apart from the first . In the early weeks , when a car fetched us from the hotel before it was light and brought us home each evening after dark , when orders obliged us to idle weekends away in our empty office , we did not live in Naples so much as merely sleep in it . Yet I waited for the city , and its intervention , much in the way that those pale companions of mine awaited life itself.  |p7In  the fourth week I was lent  --  was detailed , as they said , for military precision runs to many syllables  --  for the day to a British civilian . A marine biologist having letters from Whitehall , he too needed pages translated while he waited for the Naples Aquarium to take him tinder what my Colonel repeatedly and delightedly called its wing . In the office next to ours a telephone was put down , a name was called . The name was out , sick with a virus ; for it , mine was substituted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vehicle , as the Colonel called it  --  in the dark to Bagnoli , but walked in winter sunshine the few steps from the Hotel Vesuvio to the Hotel Royal , and sent up my name through the concierge . Of the morning I remember little : sitting with a pad and pencil in a glassed-in , blue-rugged hotel room  --  a room that was not , with its aquatic reflections , unlike an aquarium in itself  --  turning my eyes time and again to the bay ; seeing it , because of what I was writing about , not as a blue surface filling a curve of land but as a dense and teeming jungle in which weeds and rocks and wrecks and a million creatures reproduced in strange counterpartthe city of Naples itself . Echinoderms , I wrote of , and the Mysidae and the Squillidae , and compiled a list of publications on the Mollusca  --  these unknowns appearingmore familiar in kind than did the accustomed daily litanies of troops and materiel ; just as my companion , civil and aloof , seemed more compatible than thep8sullen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not yet noon when my scientist gave up his silent assemblingof the papers that were divided into rows across his bed , and said , " You have caught me up . " With a wad of completed pages in my hand , I rose  --  to show willing , a sort of coming to attention . He took the finished sheets and put them in a folder without checking them  --  a courtesy , I thought , like not seeming to count one 's change . " Can you go and play for a while ? I have to put the next lot together , and something is missing . Could you be back here , say , at three ? " In this way I was set at liberty , and left the hotel as , full of joyful purpose as if I had been going to an assignation . Until then I had not been once in the city in the middle of the day . But after weeks of surveillance the sense of freedom came as much from the fact that no one knew where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before noon on a fine December morning . The three hours at my disposal  --  a space of time that now , when all days are my own , often passes unnoticed  --  seemed then a gift , a luxury beyond which one need not forecast . I did not doubt that I would turn up again at the Hotel Royal at three . The only thing to be thought of was how to spend these hours of one 's own . I possessed a single introduction to Naples  --  one letter provided by a London acquaintance who had encouragedme to present myself at the address on the envelope . " Somewhere in the thick of Naples , " said thisp9well-wisher , who had never himself been there . The addresswas that of a woman whose name had become known  --  and was by then becoming forgotten  --  in connection with one of the post-war films from Italy . There was Bicycle Thieves , you remember ; there was Shoeshine , there was Open City . And then there was a film called Del Tempo Felice that was made from an obscure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the author of this book whose name was on my envelope . I had never read it , her book . I had seen her film , but I was then very young and had remembered its darkly photographed interiors and flickering close-ups for two reasons  --  because it was the first time I had been to a film that used sub-titles ; and the first time that I saw the lines of Dante from which the title was taken and which appeared , off-centre , on the screen along with the other credits , duly translated in sub-title but carrying , as sometimeshappens , in their own , then unfamiliar language , the physical aspect of poetry that sends a shiver across the sight and skin . And now that there was time to call myself to her attention , I could only think : a woman of this kind , with work , friends , admirers  --  a public , even  --  would hardly welcome a stranger with no better credentials than a note ( a note which I had seen for myself began " Dear Signorina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The name  --  her Christian name , that is  --  had struckp10me ; also the address , for there was a street number , then simply " San Biagio dei Librai " : Saint Biagio of the Booksellers . I had remarked on this address when the letter was handed to me . And the friend at Ealing  --  who had known the lady , it now came out , only outside Italy  --  said , " Let 's hope I got it right . I rather gather this is the good old family palazzo . I hope she 'll do you proud . " All had , in fact , been in the realm of aspiration or surmise . It occurred to me , as I walked back to the Hotel Vesuvio , that I might telephone this Signorina at once and see if she would have me . But the prospect of picking up the telephone and shattering her unsuspecting morningwas more than I could face for her ; and when I got up to my room I took out , instead of her address , a guidebook that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The traveller who would know Naples "  --  so the guidebook dictated , open on the hotel counterpane  --  " must take himself to Spaccanapoli , the split of Naples , the street that traversed the city 's nucleus in classical times , and is now called San Biagio dei Librai . " Nevertheless it took some time to make the call . First I got cut off , and in the wire a low voice asked , though not of me , " Tu , come giudici ? " Then I heard the telephone ringing , ringing , and was about to hang up at the instant when the ringing exchanged itself for a voice . Tracing the hotel 's stitched monogram with a nervous finger , I madep11myself known ; and in English the voice cried , " Good . Good that you called . Yes , come , come . Come now . Come for lunch . Are you coming in a taxi ?  --  my street is up , you ca n't enter , it 's the drains . Tell him to let you out at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's only a few minutes on foot from there . " Below the Gesu Nuovo there is a ramp of a street that rises to a corner where Degas once lived with his Neapolitanrelatives . The ascent , oblique , suggests the piazza a hove by giving , as if through a door ajar on a high landing , a glimpse of the exorbitant , gem-cut facade of a church , with to the left a flash of red stucco , to the right an ornate obelisk , before it catapults you on to a scene that appears , from this method of approaching it , more bizarre than ever . I fad I been accompanied , I might have laughed out loud at the profligacy of imagination expended there ; but solitude , which is held to be a cause of eccentricity , in fact imposes excessive normality , at least in public , and I crossed the piazza with no outward sign of interest and placed myself against the faceted stones of the church . From there one looked , then , across at the bombed shell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campanile on the one hand and a massive palace on the other ; and this I did for some moments , only showing it wits new to me by enquiring , of the priest who came to close the church , the way to San Biagio dei Librai.  |p12The  day had deteriorated , it was winter again , and the piazza was abandoned for the siesta . One pre-war Fiat , as lonely , as historic as the single car on an antiquated postcard , had been parked in the middle of the square . And I , perhaps , walking away from the church door , would have something now of the same anonymous , arrestedlook  --  captured , as the saying goes , in the picture ; serving to show , merely , by human contrast , the dimensions of buildings , to date the photograph unwittinglywith my clothes and hair ; somebody purloined from a crowd to act as an example . The light itself had dwindled to the joyless sepia of an old photograph . The picture is re-animated  --  rather , it dissolves to life  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow channel that flows out from the farther side of the square . Past a hundred shops and stalls that sold , as they are selling still , song records , coloured nylon sponges , the gauze and sugar paraphernalia of christenings and first communions , plastic Bambis , bolts of print material , gold jewellery and silver representations of arms and legs to be offered up to departmental saints ; past open sacks of coffee beans , stacks of books new and seventhhand , and barrows piled with hand-tools  --  through this I came , that afternoon , into San Biagio dei Librai . What could be closed was closing in a savage drum-roll of descending grilles ; what could be wheeled was being trundled away . Over cobbled blocks  --  that were posted here and there with stone bollards intended to keep outp13the cars that expertly slid between them and rushed on to st raddle a long trench of drainage repairs  --  I walked by palaces of stone and stucco , rusticated or red , white with grey facings , brown , orange , rose or ochre , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corridor as monumentallyas if they had been rising , isolated , in some open place that did their proportions justice. on to the flanks of those palaces , smaller buildings had been grafted in every age except our own  --  in any unlikely opening , on any precarious ledge , apparently H ittt the sole provision that they bear no resemblance to one another . Forgotten or overlaid , antiquity had been Innu ried in the walls , making its laconic signal  --  a sunken column , Greek , dark , smooth as silk , with acanthi'scapital ; a Roman inscription , traces of a fortification , or crenellations that , centuries since , had been surmounted by a rooftop . In one vast courtyard was planted a colossal sculpture , Roman or Renaissance , of a horse 's head ; another ended in galleries of disintegrating frescoes . I t was a deep square of a building , hers ; pale stucco , divided into a dozen apartments , or a hundred . Theportiere , coming out from his lunch with his fork , pooled with pasta , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the courtyard to point out , in aold of that flaking parchment , the inner staircase Ishould take . There were several flights of deep stoneus , unlit , uncarpeted . Only on the last landing , in thep14spot where one paused to draw breath before ringing the bell , an oblong of shredding crimson had been placed before a pair of dark doors and carried dusty , tapering impressions of several days ' shoes . I rang the bell , heard nothing , rang again . The excitement of the street receded . Anticlimax brought back the sense of intrusion , as I stood there with the letter in my handbag like a warrant to search , to root out secrets . From far off , as if it had been beyond the building , a woman 's voice called , " Tosca ! " There was silence , there was movement , and the same voice calling , " Tosca , Tosca . " The voice approached the door , so full and musical that it might have been introducing an aria . A bolt was drawn , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's appearance has become merged now with knowledge of her , with moods and events and questions , so that in describing it I feel I am giving a false impressionand introducing , even to myself , a woman I do not know . If one says that she was rather tall , dark-haired , dark-eyed , with in winter a pale colouring , paler than apricot , one has described nothing more than a woman who is in all probability good-looking . Even in giving these few facts I am getting off the track , for I myself would hardly recognise her from such a description : it is almost as if I were describing her skeleton , without the intercostal tissue that gave it life and singularity . Yet her physical beauty was as strong a part of her character asp15though she were personally accountable for the deep set-t ing of the eyes or the long rise of the cheekbone . Its first and lasting impression was one of vitality and endurance . That is to say , of power : a power as self-contained , as unoppressive as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled both doors apart , and stood for an instant with a hand raised along each of them . A coiled weight of hair was prefigured in the upward , backwardcarriage of the head . She wore a sweater of some dark colour , and a flannel skirt divided into pleats as was then the fashion , and round her feet a heavy white cat was making the figure eight . As we greeted one another and she stood aside , trippingthe cat , to let me enter , Tosca  --  presumably it was Tosca  --  appeared at last from the furthest corner of a dim hallway and stood for a moment there like a figure barely discerned in the background of some dark canvas  --  a presence made mysterious , perhaps , simply by the fact that it is indistinct . Gioconda brought me into a high room closed off from light and air by outer and inner shutters , and by the custom of southern cities unalterable on the coldest days ; smelling of wax , of winter , of mildew and precautions against mildew . The walls were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and topped with a twofootfrieze of a grey geometrical design whose regularity was flawed here and there by age or damp . There were thick curtains , thin carpets , worn velvet chairs and foot/stools . There were pictures , and a mesh-fronted bookcase of bound books paired with a glass-fronted cabinet of porcelain . Two small sofas were ranged by an immense cold fireplace that , like a dormant Vesuvius , presided over everything . I took note , that first time , of all these fittings and fixtures I was never to notice again ; imagining them , then , to have some bearing on her life as I was to know it . But she led me through the room as if it had been no more than a passage , into a small study filled with light and littered with papers and books . Plants and vases , pencils and matchboxes had arranged themselves there with a look of purposeful incongruity , like objects for still-life grouped about an artist 's studio . The windows were unshuttered , and a maltreated Empire desk , from which some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a cushioned chair , in bad shape , on which the cat at once circled itself ; and a striped divan on which we sat , she and I , speechless and inquisitive like children at first school . " So here you are , " said Gioconda , as if she had been awaiting my arrival for a long time  --  or as if , entering into my own point of view , she could regard my presence in her room as the fulfilment of an intention , even though not her own . It was curious to think , then , how I had for weeks been aware of her , while she had not known of my existence . " Your street , " I said to her . " Your street is mar-vellous. "  | " Oh  --  this street . . . " She thought so too  --  so much so that good manners called for her to depreciate it . " They 're always telling me  --  my friends  --  Why do n't you move ? Because it 's rough round here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not squalor exactly  --  " " Not squalor ! " she cried . " If this street is n't squalor , I 'd like to know what is . " We both laughed at her indignation , she putting her hand up to her mouth in a gesture so completely hers that the picturing of it brings her more before my eyes than any photograph could do  --  it was as if she were , quite irrationally , self-conscious about her mouth or her teeth , or unavailingly wished to he more moderate in her responses . " This is Naples with a vengeance  --  and literally so , since we have the vendettaround here : I 'm always hearing the grocer was stabbed , or that they 're on the lookout for the drycleaner . But there it is  --  it 's what I 'm used to , I could n't live elsewhere . " Saying this , her expression clouded , as i f being bound to that place was a disturbing rather than a stabilising attachment . " I was born here . " She turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchanging information , " Where were you born ? " It is n't so much where one was born ( as a matter of fact , in my case , it was in Notting Hill Gate ) , but what one remembers . I told Gioconda how , as a child , I had been sent with other children on a ship to Cape Town to escape the Blitz . How my mother died at the end of the war and my brother came out to Africa to work inp18Somaliland , and I moved there with him , and at last went back to London . " London is nice , " she said . " I was there not so long ago . We 'll talk about it another day , when there 's more time . " This assumption of our friendship moved me , in my loneliness , with a sort of joy  --  that this lovely , vital creature was to attach her life , however lightly , to mine . I was touched , but showed no pleasure  --  just as when I had stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of San Biagio dei Librai . In fact I was often , later on , to act out with Gioconda a circumspection I did not feel : her abundance made others reticent ; her opennessevoked discretion . " I 'm called Jenny , " I told her , in answer to her question  --  for we were pursuing our child-like exchange , as if we might at any moment have come out with " How old are you ? " or " What does your father do ? " " It 's not your name , then ? " " Jenny is a bureaucratic accident . My name is Penelope . When I was put on board the ship for South Africa at the beginning of the war , I was called Penny . But there were so many of us  --  so many little Mollies and Timmiesand Patties  --  that the woman in charge of us got the names mixed up . Jenny was as close as she ever came to mine . I was not of an age to make an issue of it . I went on board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing  --  imagining , I knew , the jour/ney . Whenever the matter came up , people expressed anguish over that uprooting of mine . Yet  --  although the sufferings of children are the worst , being inextinguishable  --  children themselves seldom have a proper sense of their own tragedy , discounting and keeping hidden the true horrors of their short lives , humbly imagining real calamity to be some prestigious drama of the grown-up world . Other , unconfided things were worse to me , at the time , than the actual fact of my removal to South Africa  --  for that searing displacement at least bore official sanction in the minds of adults and was shared with hundreds of others . The loss of my name , and for such a reason , did not offend me until much later ; indeed  --  for even a child can wish for the illusion of a new identity , arriving in a strange country , purged of the past , starting afresh ; in fact a child is more entitled to the delusion  --  I fancied , as I landed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin what , with no sense of comedy , I identified to myself as a new life . A double life , rather , for in my letters and my homesickness I remained Penny . As a little girl , however , I saw myself as such , insignificant in the convulsions of war , and believed I had no cause for complaint in a world where soldiers died and cities were devastated . It is only in retrospect I know myself to have been among the victims of war , and dare not mention that at the time I suffered , more grotesquely , over exclusion from a school party , or from the fear of punishment in connection with a torn blazer.  |p20That  stranded childhood comes back to me in curious ways , with unlikely associations . The sea , for instance  --  in those years of war children were greatly aware of the sea and of those imperilled on it . It was the ocean , its impassability , that lay between me and the natural course of my life ; between me and home . The ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the City of Benares , the Jervis Bay , the San Demetrio , the Ark Royal , the Graf Spee . We used to see ships , shabby , painted grey , put in at Cape Town harbour , to disappear in the night and perhaps forever . We knew their shapes and tonnages , we accumulated stories of the Atlantic crossings and the Arctic convoys . We knew that the Queens could outpace any U-boat and carried eight thousandtroops , and that you could stay fourteen days in a neutral port . By contrast it seems now that the sea has almost retired from our lives , and that ships are leadinga marginal , twilight existence , like senior officials who resist being pensioned off . Gioconda said , " Yet I think you look more like Jenny than Penelope . I could never picture Penelope with that colour hair . " " Sometimes , though , I still feel like Penelope . When I fill out a form , it feels appropriate . " I remarked on her own name . " It is not uncommon in Italy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , completing the game of names , was called Iocasta : had been thus renamed , from Innocente , afterp21conceiving kittens with its own son . In commendation or sympathy she snatched it up  --  round the middle , with both hands , as a child might  --  gave it a squeeze and set it down again on its chair , where it smoothly resumed a wash interrupted in mid-lick . " Come on to the terrace and tell me if it 's warm enough to lunch out there . " That room of hers gave on to a terrace , long and wide and sheltered at one end by a pergola draped with the wintry skeletons of vines and by wistaria that still showed , here and there , a purple tassel or a frond of green . At the other end there were stone boxes of marigolds . A table had been laid for us in the pale sun , and one of its legs was lengthened with a wedge of paper to meet the uneven tiles . " It 's heaven , " I said . We leant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the cortile there were two or three small businesses  --  a woodworker 's , a printer 's giving out a clackety rhythm , and a narrow archway marked " Autoscuola . " " Yes , truly , it 's a garage , a driving school . " Gioconda'shand went to her mouth . " I suppose you qualify for the licence if you can get the car out of this court-yard . " It was not , after all , the good old family palazzo . Her father had owned a larger part of it until the war . " What I have now  --  they made an entrance , broke up the enfiladeof main rooms  --  it 's just what you 've seen , with another room or two . . . The thing was to keep this . "  |p22She  meant the terrace , patting the stone railing with the flat of her hand . She still had relatives in Naples  --  " too many by far "  --  but they were cousins and second cousins . She had a sister she was fond of , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She married a Frenchman . Before the war . He was killed in ' 44 . " She broke off to lead me to the end of the terrace . " From here you can see every-thing . " It was almost true , this everything , for the arches and towers and polychrome domes were stacked there beside and behind each other like so much scenery backstage at a theatre , all painted by Monsu Desiderio . There was no tracing the streets that unrolled like ribbons among them , no accounting for the cloisters and vast gardens that appeared at intervals , like optical illusions in the foreshortenedscene  --  the congested , backstage effect heightened by the fact that we were looking into the city and away from the sea . There was no outlook , in any usual sense ; except to our left where , painted by a different hand , a segment of the Vomero rose up in tiers of fields and buildings . " That red curve of houses follows the wall of the theatre where Nero sang . " The big thing below the cathedralhad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Dioscuri , that church was the site of the Roman basilica . The question " What is it ? " took on , here , an aspect of impertinence ; one might only learn what it had successively been.  |p23Gioconda  told me that San Biagio was the patron saint of throats ; little children prayed to him about their tonsils , he had an attraction for singers with laryngitis . I recalled a variety of labral discs among the silver offeringson sale in the street , and knew these , now , to be throats . When we sat down to our lunch , she asked me , " How did you arrive in Italy ? " and I told her how I had been flown to Milan with my military men for a conference there , and sent on by train . I was grateful to her for mentioning the journey .

She filled our glasses , and said , " I hope you 'll be happy here , " as though she were responsible . That struck her too , for she remarked , " I talk like a landlady who is taking in a new lodger . " I told her I had seen nothing of Naples until that day , how it had come about that I was free to telephone her , and I looked at my watch . At once she asked when I could come again . I had to go to the airport on an errand the following Friday afternoon , and I said I could drop in on the way back . " Yes , of course , come , come , " she said , as she had onp24the telephone . " Friday , a friend arrives . . . from Rome . He 'll be so pleased to meet you .

The name she now said was new to me ; though her glance , tentative , enquiring , might have suggested otherwise . I thought , the map of her existence is soon to be flagged , for me , with these encampments and shrines , these centres of interest ; and again the notion gave pleasure . When I got up to go , she held out her hand . She surprised me by asking , " What is he like , your biologist ? " " He 's a Scotsman . " " A , sandy , bristly little chap , then ? " " Not at all .

"  |p25MY  BROTHER 'S WIFE is an emphatic little woman . When I first knew her , she could look delicious even so , an infuriated kitten . " Oh , it 's outrageous , " she would say , flashing neat little teeth in her rage . " One has to take a stand . " Or " I do n't have to put up with this sort of thing .

My mother came out to South Africa to see me , during the terrible English winter of947 . I had grown up without her , and now I was old enough to be touched by what I recognised in her as thep26ravages of war . She was exhausted , from sleepless nights , from fearing death , from longing for me and grieving for others , from standing in queues and mending old clothes . It showed in her distinctly , it would set her apart at once from others in a Cape Town street , even though she was an ordinary , fair , little woman .

During her last days at Cape Town I remember plying her with extra nourishment and setting her in the sun , as if she were a shrivelled plant one was attempting to coax back to life . They wrote me , " Her heart gave out "  --  her heart that had , I suppose , been giving out always , to everybody , with no revitalising intake of grievances or selfpity . For some time after that it seemed I could not urge reconsideration of my future  --  a future that was being consumed in its very abeyance : they had too much on their hands , must not be asked to think about more ; so I reasoned , as if I had no existence other than as an extra item for someone else 's consideration , a potential last straw . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we lived as a foil for the concerns of our elders . When I was told that in another year , a year orp27two , I would be sent for , I simply began to put that time behind me . Time is said to seem long to the young , but it is only the young who can be so prodigal of it , looking forward to far-off events and wishing away the interveningweeks or months as if they were no more than an impediment to a goal . When , eventually , recall was settled on , it was not easy to get passage . And the same week that the ticket was written out by the Shaw Savill Line , my brother cabled me to stay where I was , for he was coming out to Africa . He had taken a post as an irrigation engineer in Italian Somaliland , as we called it then , with a new developmentagency , and the idea now was that I should go with him to Mogadiscio and keep house there . And so it happened that I spent three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came home to England  --  more , as my father ( remarried now , and keepingclear , in Yorkshire ) remarked , like Ulysses than Penelope . It was when my brother married Norah that I came back . Edmund had been recalled from Somalia to Londonin connection with a possible promotion . During his absence I ran our little house , did some typing for an import-export firm , and saw the few people we were in the habit of seeing . When I was asked about my brother 's return , I would say , " Very soon " or " Any day , " believingI had the information to give . All this time , change was heading for me unapprehended , like a torpedo or ap28crocodile : while I was typing out somebody 's invoice , or going to the beach in someone 's Land Rover , or fishing the wedge of orange out of my Pimm 's Cup , Edmund was taking Norah to the pictures , or to see the London productionof South Pacific , or kissing her goodnight ( for couples , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallway of her parents ' house in S.W.7 after a family Sunday of roast lamb and denunciation of Sir Stafford Cripps . When Edmund decided to remain in England , it was assumed that I too would settle there  --  just as it had earlier been assumed that I would stay with him in Africa . I do n't know why it was taken for granted ; like so many arrangements that should have been contested , it was described as a foregone conclusion . Returning to England had lost its initial meaning and taken on another . If it could no longer assuage a homesicknessthat , after its heart-splitting genesis in childhood exile , had not so much abated as become a permanent sense of lack , it gave , in compensation , unlooked-for , adult pleasures . It pleased me , for instance , that the plants and seasons now corresponded to literature ; that Nature was not the sole index of age ; that the rewards of one 's surroundings were rendered in architecture , rather than in the unearned prestige of Table Mountain . I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me near their first flat in Sloane Avenue , and now I partook of their own Sunday lamb , served up on wedding presents , while Norah described to me her plansp29for carpets and curtains , or showed me the sample of bedspread material she had hung over a chair to see if she could live with it . When I began to know her , I wondered if their courtship had been , for her , something of the same  --  my brother draped over a chair for the statutory length of time , to see if she could live with him . In that case she might have noticed that he did not really go with the surroundings ; perhaps she did see this , but knew that he would fade to a better match . To me it was quite incredible that they should be married and have a private life of lovemaking , of confidencesexchanged and silences shared , of bills and latchkeys  --  their personalities converged so little and so seldom . Even Norah 's married name , Norah Unsworth , struck one as unlikely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounding as if it belonged to the heroine of a schoolgirl 's story . The thing was , my brother adored her . That was the great and touching thing . The strength of his passion had somehow carried them both through the forms of betrothaland marriage , and continued to make a synthesis of their disparate personalities . He did not require of her that she be sympathetic to him , or intelligent about others : it was enough for her to sit there on one of those cretonne-covered chairs , holding up her Minton cup and saucer , for him to feel satisfied with his choice . For her part , Norah showed no more curiosity about Edmund than she did about anyone else  --  never asking his opin/ion or encouraging him to reveal himself ; but she too was borne along by her effect on him  --  it was as if the active force of his love kept her upright on her flowered chair and stabilised the cup in her hand , like some proposition in physics . She was exceedingly pretty , with fair , silky hair that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine little features . Her skin was pale , but she had vivid pink cheeks and would refer to " my English complexion , " as if she might have had some other kind . ( Only her hands were strangely broad and strong , with a vehement , wrenching grip ; as a fat woman will have trim , delicate feet , so did fragile Norah have these masterful large wrists and grasping fingers . ) Girls are not now described as dainty , but dainty was the word for Norah . Edmund loved to look at her : I had not realised , in Africa , how much he felt the lack of England . At the same time , he had still , then , other requirements . That was where I came in  --  literally , since I took to coming in as often as they asked me and supplyingmissing links . It was not that my brother and I talked about our own concerns in Norah 's presence , but there was always the silent assumption that I would overlook Norah 's triviality and would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and self-centredness , enough indulgence to absorb them . And this made it appear , for a time , as if Edmund and I were in league with one another , not against Norah but in her favour ;  |p31almost  as though he and I were the married couple , and she some third party whom we had agreed to humour . I have never spent so much time with a being who had no interest beyond herself . Norah talked a lot about human relationships , as she called them ( for she had picked up some kind of jargon and was always saying " identify " and " communicate , " could scarcely look at Edmund and me without the word " siblings " popping out ) , but spoke as if these were a special subject , like lepidoptery or tropical plants , of which one could hardly hope to encounter interesting examples in daily life . Like many English people she passionately wished to attach herself to the well-born and well-known . Adulation of the royal family was too commonplace for her , and she had amassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from magazines and newspapers . Once in a while , at some large cocktail party or benefit performance , her life did glancingly touch this coveted sphere , and it was as if she spent the long intervals preparing for such moments . She had never been to Cap Ferrat or Corfu , but knew who had villas there and where one ought to stay . She could tell you which Honourable Amanda was going with what younger son , and how the parents felt about it . As a scholar might value some revelation that extended his concept , so did she receive the discovery that the Belvoir Hunt was pronounced " Beaver , " or that the name Leveson-Gower should be said " Looson-Gore " ; her joy in such details was thep32measure of her relief at the revelatory gaffe she had been spared . She clung to these social canons and cyphers as desperatelyas if she had been raised among anarchists . With all this went an obsession for getting behind the scenes , being shown over by someone in the know . With her I went to television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrace at Westminster  --  and even , once , up narrow stairs and down long corridors to the board room at Paddington Station , a large white oblong containing , like one of those oriental sets of diminishing boxes , a green baize oblong only slightly less large , and lined with huge , faded photographs of locomotives with names like the Windsor Castle and the Lancashire Witch . One day , poor Norah , she would get behind the scenes once and for all , lost for good . Only my brother 's patient love drew her out by its thread , time after time , from those labyrinthine inner circles where she sought to investherself with the trappings of authority or of social standing ; to enter a company to which she felt herself  --  perhaps rightly  --  entirely qualified to belong . They were an odd lot , Norah and her family . No , that 's not it  --  they were n't odd enough , and that 's the truth . They belonged to the pre-war British middle class that feels itself in ambush in this world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the local legends of bad deeds . They had no friend whom they did not , in absence , constantly and treacherously deride.  |p33They  suspected me of being odd , and tried to settle me down , down , with bachelors from their own circle . These young men also existed in a continual state of righteous exasperation , saying things like " That could have been foreseen , " and being " fed to the teeth . " They were of that type described by Gogol , men who " itch to maintain discipline everywhere and to enforce their views on station-mastersand cabmen . " One of them , I remember , wrote a letter to The Times urging that Teddy-boys be " firmly suppressed . " Yet decency nagged at their reluctant hearts ; and they acknowledged that , too , in unconscious phrases  --  " I fail to understand . . . , " " I can not bring myself to overlook . . . , " " Tolerance is all very well up to a point . . .  --  as if they had tried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was an aspect of the England I had left , it was by no means the one to which I most wished to return . We put up with our state of affairs , Edmund , Norah , and I , for nearly three years ; I suppose that is a short time , really , for it is in the nature of such things to go on for a lifetime . For a while Edmund truly welcomed it because , as long as I would complement his marriage , it was a happy , even an ideal , one . Like other persons who are described as weak , he rigorously commanded protective services from others . Norah put up with it because she enjoyed having me to patronise , and having those requirements of Edmund 's  --  humour , curiosity  --  thatp34she could not meet supplied by me ; in the way that a frigid wife might have unconsciously encouraged her husband to take a mistress . And I put up with it because I was in love with my brother . In the telling , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If one says that one was young at the time , that alters nothing . One is always something , after all , at the time : one is old , one is young , one is in love , or in trouble , or poor or over-worked . It does not much matter what the extenuating circumstance is , and youth is mentioned here merely as the key to this particular piece of obtuseness . It was when this love dawned on me  --  as it literally did , one grey sunrise , while I stood at my window looking at the brick backs of the houses on the Fulham Road  --  that Edmund began to wish me away ; in becomingaware , I had outlived my usefulness . Now he must go on , take different measures , take a mistress , collect stamps , stay late at the office . It was then that I resigned from my job at Pascoe and Wingrove ( Norah 's father 's firm ) , and applied to be sent to Naples.  |p35IT  WAS a surprise , after Gioconda 's photographs , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a worn camel's-hair coat and a blue woollen scarf . Yet there was in Gianni 's attitude , as he appeared in her doorway a moment after my own arrival , so much of the triumphant , fish-catching stance that I should truly have known him anywhere . Though his face , with high forehead and high-bridged nose and expressive contours , was that of a city person , there was an athletic proficiency about his body . There were always certain borderline aspects to Gianni 's style : his proud walk might , on a bad day , almost have been called a strut ; his litheness was the professional grace of someone who keeps himself in what is called " condition . " Gianni , then , was forty-eight years old . At once I found myself mildly resenting , on Gioconda'sbehalf , the way in which he made himself at borne . I had understood he was Gioconda 's lover ( that very evening it was made known to me that he was sepa/rated from his wife and could not get an annulment ) ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had been a rival for her affections . Letting Tosca , who was half his height , take his coat , he asked her what there was for dinner . In no time he was making drinks for us on the marble-topped chest that served as the bar , unerringly reaching  --  as he turned his head to talk to me  --  for the right bottle , or placing his hand on a dish of lemons . If something was in his way he moved it without hesitation  --  chucking a magazine on to the sofa , dumping a pot of cyclamens on Gioconda 's blotter . While these confident gestures were not quite made for one 's benefit , it was evident that Gianni enjoyed the resolute exercise of his limbs and the accurate , unapologetic placing of his well-shod feet on the earth . I slouched more than ever into my chair in defiance of his good example . In a way I liked watching it , all the same . As I was to learn , it was not hard to entertain Gianni ; for he loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he never tired of illustrating , by cretini and anal f abetiGianni always triumphed , one gathered , with crushingripostes or by reckless action . The catalogue of his victories was like a comic-strip serial , always following the same pattern : Gianni , intrepid , took arms against envy , stupidity , or cowardice , and routed them . The forces of envy , stupidity and cowardice , endlessly returning , were endlessly put to flight . Bulletins of the campaign were interspersed with accounts of the grati/tude of fair women , of feats of physical strength , or of the manifestly misplaced confidences of the celebrated . A lot of this was funny stuff , and the whole made tolerable by the same stylish self-assertion that showed in Gianni 's bearing and gestures . Nevertheless , watching him that first day in Gioconda'sroom , I wondered how she put up with him . Later , when I saw more of Gianni , his attraction for Gioconda was to become more of a puzzle . Where Gianni was concerned it was as if she forfeited her critical faculties  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his boasting and his magisterial ways . He liked , for instance , to humiliate Gioconda in small things  --  " Your nails need doing " or " It turns out you were quite wrong about . . . "  --  but when , once or twice , I protested these remarks and took Gioconda 's part , she herself upheld him , saying , " Well , he 's right after all " or " I must have got it wrong , then , " and Gianni would give me a smug glance , like a child that has scored over another child with the grown-ups . He would even , at his worst , lead her on , encouraging her to speak of some incident or impression in order to demolish all the more conclusively her point of view ; or her affectionate mood would be developed so that it might be all the more grossly ruptured : he was kind , in fact , in order to be cruel . The likeable side of Gianni was inextricable from all this , and made itself felt in flashes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted his work . For Gianni made films , and it was Gianni who had directedthe film made from Gioconda 's book : in this way they had met . There was a compensating generosity in his nature that would rush in to fill the cavities gouged out by his own unkindness . Unexpectedly he would remembersome interest you had expressed , or some small object admired in a window would turn up for you in his pocket . The mention of an injury you had suffered would instantly have him crying down the imbecile who had offered it  --  and in this respect he was a true friend , never once indulging the fiction that there are two sides to every question . That first evening when we had our drinks and I got up to go , it was his generosity  --  and I think , too , a sense of not having been a success with me  --  that moved him to take me by the hand and ask me to spend the following day with them ; for the Colonel had given me , for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out my new car , " Gianni said . " Driving to Herculaneum , and on to Sorrento for lunch . Gioconda , tell her to come . " Gioconda looked pleased , as if he did not always approveher friends . " What a good idea . Of course . " " There you are . You must . " Gianni let go of my hand . " It 's a Maserati . " At the front door I said to Gioconda , who had come to let me out , " It 's kind , . but I won't. "  | " If you 're free , why ever not ? " " Because this is your time together . " I had learnt that Gianni came at weekends , and drove back to Rome on Sunday evenings . " Oh , if it 's only that  --  " Now Gioconda took my hand , as Gianni had done , and then released it . I was reminded of how she had quickly squeezed the cat . " We 'll pick you up at ten , say . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you might be alone together ? " Gioconda considered this , then said reasonably , " Of course I could not bear it if , at the end of the day , it was you who were to go to bed with him . " She laughed at my surprise as she closed the door . " About ten , then . " On my way back to the hotel I bought a bunch of yellow roses from a stand in Via Santa Lucia . A strong , gritty wind had blown up , and it snatched out of my hand the fragments of change I had been given . The five- and ten-lire pieces came , then , in wrinkled miniature banknotesinstead of coins , and two or three of these wheeled about the footpath , creating false opulence around me and giving desperate exercise to a group of urchins with fierce , elderly faces . When I unwrapped the roses in my nmmm , I found I had been given only the broken heads of ( lowers , discards of some florist ; but these had been fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intricately wired and laced , so ingeniously sheathed In green  --  that one seemed almost to have profited fromp40the deception . They lasted few days , these ironic flowers of Naples , though perhaps as long as any roses at that season . The same evening I wrote to my brother , " All the bananas in Italy are from Somaliland . Every day , somewhere , I pass a stall of Somali bananas  --  the fruits , quite literally , of your labours . " When I wrote this sort of thing to Edmund I had to wonder if I were not excludingNorah , still invoking the existence that Edmund and I had once shared . Yet  --  so I thought  --  it might be as well to leave them a little something to put up with : I knew , and the knowledge gave pain , how often Edmund would assure himself that my disappearance was the best thing for everyone concerned  --  it is what people always say when they have arranged something exclusively to suit themselves . If he no longer wanted to learn about himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had been young enough to enjoy my influence over him without recognising that it originated in his weakness . This reasoning covered the wish to hurt him . But resentment begets perception , of a kind , and the reason itself was true  --  the part about Edmund 's not wishing to know himself . He was catching slogans from Norah and , if he did ever speak of his own character now , it was to inter it in a heap of abstractions . " I 'm something of a masochist , " he would write me , as casually as he might have said , " I 've joined the Athenaeum " ; or " I 'm in myp41manic phase . " Thus , gratefully , he renounced uniquenessfor a textbook anonymity . " That 's just people " had become his favourite phrase . His opinions too had taken on much of Norah . She put words into his mouth ; and they emerged , lightly colouredlike litmus paper by his own mild reaction . The habit of meeting Edmund 's requirements was strong in me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general as bland as the replies that came back . " I have been befriended here by an Italian woman . . . , " thinkingas I wrote how Norah and her circle , with their conventionalanglicised idea of all south Italy , would imagineGioconda , if they imagined her at all  --  picturing her squat , voluble , perhaps with a light moustache . I even played up , involuntarily , to this misconception  --  it is useless to offer true impressions of one 's life to those who actively desire not to learn of it in other than untroublesometerms ; one might as well subscribe to whateverfiction is imposed . Beyond this was the instinct , of self-preservation , to keep this tentative new existence to myself . My sister-in-law 's letters were vehement in their wish to forestall any suggestion of infelicity on my part . If this was to be the best thing for everyone , there was to be no possibility of second thoughts . " Good to know you are so happy , " she would say in every letter . Assiduously she built up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formless and solitary as mine could never intrude . " Youp42must be very happy , " she would direct me ; " I tell everyonehow happy you are , " she would warn , producing witnesses . These letters arrived without mercy at every crisis of my life , and they do so still . On the other hand , she got edgy if , compliantly , I spoke of genuine pleasure . When I wrote of the white steamers setting out for Capri , she replied , " Capri must be very spoilt now . " If I mentioned the streets of Naples , she wrote back , " I can never forget that American gangsterismoriginated there . " My smallest achievement must be minimised : " Lucky you . " With Norah the unconsciouswas always uppermost : you had to dig down to find the conscious . Of true homesickness  --  the longing for the habitual  --  I suffered little , for I had never acquired or been provided with familiar things ; mine , from childhood , had been an existence improvised among the unfamiliar . Nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply alien as that life of indignation and Sunday roasts that I had left behind . For my brother , however , and our lost companionship , our lost intimacy of thought and look and word , I suffered what one does for love , assailed  --  in a shop or at my desk , while continuing to talk of other things  --  by anguish , as by the pang of some mortal but concealed infirmity . A postcard from Edmund , sent to me from Stockholm where he had briefly gone on business , moved me to desolate tears  --  so separate did we seem from one another then , each in ap43place unimaginable to the other , each irrevocably set on his tangential course , the dividing ocean once more between us . . . 0 Seigneur , que tant de mers me separentde vous . Nonetheless I knew , hating to know it , that our conditionwas not the worst , since one of us wished it that way . It is when both desire it otherwise that logic is violated , and the course of events seems uselessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sang rather well , and quite a lot . When very young he had the idea of becoming a professionalsinger , but abandoned it because of the battles one had to fight . There were the teachers , the impresarioswho did not recognise talent , or were jealous of it ; there was the now celebrated cellist who , auditioning together with the youthful Gianni , had talked throughoutGianni 's performance . " Dunque  --  Maestro , ' I asked him . What would you think of someone who talked while you performed ? ' And , giving me that smile  --  with his mouthful of white teeth which were not then exclusively false  --  he said , Ah , but you see , when I perform , no one talks ' ' Then , ' said I , the difference is that your audience is composed only of civilised persons . ' " Gianni sang as he drove us to Herculaneum in his new car . He could sing arias , and knew Neapolitan songs by the dozens  --  " Libero Bovio , Salvatore di Giacomo , those are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ladislas , or Joachim Murat . " When we approachedp46the royal palace at Portici he slowed down . " Look at this . Who but a Neapolitan would have a country retreat with the road going right through the house ? And at the foot of an active volcano . " He laughed , and thumped his hand on the wheel , highly satisfied with the folly of the Bourbons . Gianni was something of a patriot . That is to say that all foreigners , and particularly Anglo-Saxons , came in for a mauling . " The names these people have , " he remarked , although my name was practically the same as his . " Where do they get them from . I had an actress once  --  I mean , in a film I directed  --  a skinny-looking thing like you , English , called Sally . Imagine , salt . A fine name for a girl . " I leant forward , my elbows along the back of their seat , my chin bumping on my enlaced knuckles . The nape of Gioconda 's neck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her throat , as if in summer her hair had hung down over it ; above this whiteness , twisted glossy ropes of hair were secured by a comb of curved tortoiseshell . " Your comb . I never saw anything like it . " Her fingers came up to touch it . " How old is it , do you think ? Or an old copy of something old ? Here  --  and here  --  there must have been stones ; diamonds , even , for the rest of the work is so fine . I found it on a barrow in San Biagio  --  one of those barrows , you must have seen them , where they sell , or try to sell , cracked saucers and broken keyrings , rubbish scavenged from here and there.  |p47I  took it home and cleaned it . And Gianni liked it . " Here Gianni gave a possessive , endorsing nod . " I 've worn it for years . " It was a pale , cold day , quiet as a weekday . We were almost alone on the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we came into a country market where a dozen stunted donkeys , each dragging its own teetering Vesuvius of ill-corded bales , applied their muzzles humidlyto the Maserati as it inched among them . Not long afterwards this little town founded on the lava was submergedunder the eruption of skyscrapers flung up by a housing project . At Herculaneum we were the only visitors , wandering unaccompanied through vacant Roman rooms , like guests who have arrived on the wrong day and can take stock of things without having to be polite . Gianni loved my pleasure in the ruins , proud as if the town were his own creation , explaining the arrangement of the houses , the changes of situation caused by volcanic action  --  " Here was the sea , then , with gardens and cypress alleys leading down to it . All that land down there came much later . " Every so often he would tell us , " It was a marvellouslife , " as if he himself had been plucked out of it . " Look at this , for instance . " Gianni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corridor-like streets and into an ornate room that had served , possibly , as a private theatre  --  one end giving a sense of proscenium , decorated with a stone mask set above mosaics of animals and garlands . " What could be more charming . " He followed me up thep48room to examine the decorations and , taking me by the shoulders , stood me in the niche intended for some statue . He then kissed me  --  or attempted to , his mouth roughly glancing over my chin and throat as I spun my head away , dodging his caress like a blow . He dropped his hands from my shoulders but still stood blocking the way , looking at me and smiling , and repeating in a normal voice , " What could be more charming . " I stood in the niche where he had placed me . Even to push him away seemed too much like a response . In an undertone he complained to me , " Why the fuss . I am only , so to speak , observing the conventions . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Gioconda'sproximity somewhere in this labyrinth obliged me to lower my voice to him like an accomplice . " Damn you and your conventions . " Gianni walked away . Having stepped down through the narrow doorway he turned back , one hand raised and resting on the outer wall , to look at me with the same bright eyes and hard , humorous compression of the lips . " Just one moment , " said Gioconda , out of sight . Gianni stood quite still . In the street beyond there was a tiny sound , and Gioconda appeared beside him winding her camera . " It was so natural , " she said . " So like you . " Gioconda later gave me this photograph , along with one or two others she took that day . I have it still , and there is Gianni , smiling ironically out of the picture at something that has momentarily taken his fancy.  |p49I  remained some minutes more in that small Roman theatre  --  that had , I daresay , seen a lot of this kind of thing played out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reference to this incident , in the car as we drove on around the gulf to Sorrento  --  observingto Gioconda that he found me young for my age . " Strange to think , " he said , as if I were not present , " that there are only six or seven years between you two . You seem like my contemporary , while she  --  " tipping his head back in my direction  --  " might just be leaving school . Or entering it . " Over his shoulder he gave me , too  --  again as if the matter were crucial and personal to him  --  accounts of the great eruption , quoting Pliny to us as though to back up his own testimony , citing like fresh evidence the letters of the poet Statius . " You see how it is with us , " he said  --  meaning Italians , or perhaps the human race . " The ships were waiting to take them off . Ash and lava were streaming down on them . But they had dinner , they talked , they went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too late . " I could see that he thought well of them for this , just as he had commended the impracticality of the Bourbons ; and quite expected him to add , as he did , " There is something to be said for it , after all . " And when I , still sulking , made no reply , he most unfairly shrugged at Gioconda as if to give me up as a bad job . Of that journey , with Vesuvius slowly turning us on itsp50flank , then releasing us for the long arc of the bay , there remains a childhood sensation of disappointment : my outing had been spoilt , the expedition had shifted characterin an unlooked-for way . In memory there is a blur of cold sea and silver fields , and then we are at Sorrento and I am cheerful again , having had my lunch and being excited by the pretty restaurant , the romance of the slopes above and cliffs below , and the great view out to Capri . It is as Gianni has just said , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied the usual pair of musicians , small elderly wielders of accordion and fiddle , one of whom  --  the one with the wall eye  --  sang in a voice reedily tender , shaken with infirmity . There was also a fortune-teller , who had little to do in the winter months when the clientele were off seeking their fortunes by other means . She fell on us the moment we entered . Gianni purchased our freedom with a few coins , and we watched her go to work  --  her gypsy costume topped by a worn grey cardigan  --  on the only other patrons of the restaurant , a ravishing blonde girl and her white-haired escort , who interrupted the process with bursts of delightedlaughter in which the fortune-teller joined herself from time to time , the gold hoops in her ears bouncing joyfully on the neck of her cardigan . " That 's the kind of future to have , " Gioconda said to us . " It 's got them laughing already , just the idea of it . " " It 's not difficult to imagine what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly along Gioconda 's arm resting on the tablecloth . Gioconda and I watched the other table . The affair grew more serious , the couple drawing together as they listened , sometimes glancing at one another and halfsmilingto assure themselves that it was fantasy . Gianni was bored . " It 's utterly transparent . They pick out a few things that happen to everybody , and make a revelation of it . " " Psychologists too , " Gioconda agreed , " will often explain the most obvious things to you as if they were professionaldiscoveries . ' What 's alluring is the illusion , not even of power , but of authority . Is n't that what we want , from gods , priests , poets , even from those columns in the newspaper that answer letters ? The possibility that someonereally knows , and has got the upper hand of it all . " I said , " Some people do know more than others . That contributes to the impression that someone , somewhere , knows the whole thing . " " Neapolitans know a lot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Break them up , take them away , and they 're hopeless , just as stupid as anyone else . It 's the city , the phenomenon of Naples itself , that knows something . It 's like an important picture , or a book  --  once you 've taken it in , you ca n't believe there was a time when you did n't know it . " He turned to me . " This will change everything for you , being here . Naples is a leap . It 's through the looking-glass . " And I looked out at the oval mirror of the bay.  |p52There  was no more laughter from our companions . In the end their fortunes proved sobering . They parted from the seer in low voices , and a few more coins changed hands . When they got up to go , the man put his arm around the girl , and drew her to him and kissed her cheek  --  in consolation , perhaps , or with a premonitionH of loss . Shortly after these meetings with Gioconda , I moved out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along the foot of the Posillipo . In the sea , one might have said , since the apartment was in one of the villas that stand outin the bay all along the northern arc of Naples , and have a water life of their own . Beginning at Mergellina with a crumbling seventeenth-century colossus , they end at Gaiola with a Roman ruin ; their names alone are an inventory of the eccentric . These buildings look on to the gulf of Naples , and are interspersed with grottoes and declivities of the pale gold stone of which that shore is composed , and even with shreds of a disappearing countrysideand surviving groups of umbrella pines . Above them rises the headland of the Posillipo  --  already then encumbered with a ridge or two of the modern blocks that were to deface it completely over the next few years . An open-air nightclub , wedged into the tufa near my building , lay in wait for its season ; and a bedraggled restaurant or two commanded , from scruffy terraces , the incomparable , lake-like prospect of the bay. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different building , that stood higher on the hillside , above and behind . From this one went down , in a tiny bathysphereof an elevator , through rock , and arrived at one end of a long corridor roughly tunnelled from solid stone , painted and tiled dark red . The corridor could be lit by a series of electric buttons whose sequence , timed for a loping run , provided a certain claustrophobic excitement . This deep crossing passed under Via Posillipo and through the tiny promontory of which my villa formed the prow . It ended in a flight of steep steps and a grilled door , beyond which were light , sky , and the sea . A glassed-in catwalk had been attached to the villa 's side , leading past the doors of the many apartments into which the house had been divided . Nothing could have been more canny , more uncanny , more Neapolitan , than this means of access . " Romantic , " I wrote of it to Norah  --  and it did have something of the sinister that is an authentic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , disembarking at a landing stage of stone steps glossy with moss , being admitted to the house through another green-grilled door . The building itself was red stucco , lifted clear of the water on foundations of grey stone ; seen from a distanceit floated forward in air like a rusty boat in the slips . I had two big rooms there , and they were the most beautiful rooms , by far , that I had lived in . Like mostp54missionaries , we lived better than those we had come to save ; immunities and allowances broke our fall into this new ambience , we had cars to drive us and maids to keep us clean . My rooms gave on to a narrow terrace that , in turn , looked directly across the sea to the volcano : the rooms , the terrace , were like antechambers to the spectacle , their purpose was to disclose it . That view of the Bay of Naples has passed the point where it can ever find its master , its Guardi or its Canaletto ; has become virtuallya comic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those who have never seen them , now to be revealed . It gives an impression of indifference to the role humanly assigned to it  --  as if it will go on lending itself to posters , to chocolate boxes , without ever giving itself away ; just as Vesuvius goes on absorbing the tributes of those it clearly intends to exterminate . There was another floor of apartments , then the water . One might have fished from the terrace . At the rear , where the apartment was entered from the glass walk , there was a wide hallway , and an inner room lined with immense wardrobes and camphor-saturated chests . The whole place was densely , darkly furnished , with great bed and mighty chairs , long table , carved sofa ; a flimsier note occasionally struck , like the triangle in an orchestra , by a black tripod plant stand from UPIM or a gilt magazine holder , like an outsize toastrack , from the Rinascente . In the kitchen , small stove and smaller sink flanked a huge old splay-footed refrigerator ; while be/neath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here a cheese-grater , there a corroded colander , or a corkscrew still impaling its wine-dark cork . On the bathtub , an imported fitting hailed you in your own language : WASTE . Of the heavy dark chests and chairs , several were subsequently stacked in a box-room beyond the kitchen , while others were dragged away at my request and made their way into various unprotesting flats in the building . There was a long stairway like a stone ladder , without turns or landings , leading from the sea right up to the road , and any object too large for the elevator was heaved up or down this cliffway . So that one might at any time observe a packing case or a bureau coming painfullydown on somebody 's hooped back ; and once , lookingfrom the kitchen window , I saw a great rubber tree in a pot , moving in this way , among the pines , to Dunsinane . Gianni and Gioconda came to see my flat one evening , bringing with them a tub of narcissus . Since Gianni had never been known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small boy who arrived behind them with his face buried in the suffocating flowers . To my surprise Gianni praised everything  --  he was delighted with the house and with the strangeness of the approach to it . " You 're beginning to get the idea , " he said , as if I had shown myself an apt pupil . It was a freezing night : Gianni tried to light the singlep56fireplace , but the flue would not draw and we sat in our coats in front of a tiny electric stove that scorched the tiles , and our feet , and was otherwise heatless . They drank to my new life in whisky I had obtained that day , duty-free , from the PX . The sight of this unmanned , woman 's enterprise moved Gianni at once to take command . " You could have the chimney altered to make it work , " he said . " But that takes brains . In Rome it might be worth doing , even though it 's not your own place , but here . . . When it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colour , and there it stops . They ca n't hang a picture without knocking the wall down . " After they had gone I put the lamps out and looked through the flawed , icy glass of the terrace doors at the lighted city to the left . Behind my back the radiator put out its ineffectual red tonguetips . The window returned my breath , slightly steamy with PX whisky and merged with the smell of narcissus and of the charred fire that Gianni could not light . It was in this confusion of the ignominious and grandiose that I experienced the first moments of pure happiness.  |p57THE  MISSION I had accompanied from England was composed , for the most part , of military men . When I joined it I knew nothing of the professional soldier in modern times . Seething is the word I find for them : many of those people , particularly the officers , were perpetuallyseething  --  with fury , with fear , and with the daily necessity of striking out before they could be felled by inapprehensible foes . Of this seething , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , their attitude to their authorised enemies  --  Soviets , socialists , and agitators of all breeds  --  was tinged with a wistful worship : " Catch them putting up with a mess like this " or " They would n't tolerate this set-up for a second . " ) My London life , deficient as it had been , had not included those who perceived solutions in the violent deaths of numberless others , and who passionately advocatedthis view . Their cruelty could not be shamed . No revelation of its origins or its consequences abashed them . Armouredp58with the most brutal of emotions , self-pity , they were invulnerableto the human claims of others . These days I would be more comprehending of them , and less tolerant ; but then I was baffled by all the seething and tried , quite mistakenly , to make allowances for it . I should never have got mixed up with them . But on the whole , having the compensations of the city , was more contented than any of them ; and vaguely suspect for being so . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose office I sat . A great seether , he had been military attache at any number of British embassies , whose superior organization he often cited to us . He was small and trim , with a thin mouth beneath a thin bristle of moustache , shiny little shoes , and an upright bearing ; taken together , these attributes conveyed a state of continual defiance . As a child he must have been impressed with the merit of looking people in the eyes , and had in consequence developed a fixed glare that so revealed him that , out of common humanity , one could only look away . He had been divorced , and lived alone on the Posillipo , in a building next to mine . It was arranged that the car that called for him each morning should bring me , too , to our offices at Bagnoli , and in this way I started the day with him a full half-hour earlier than might otherwise have been the case . One morning , as we stood side by side in wintry sunshine , he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our silence , J. P. Tulloch drew up to the curb in a dark green M.G.He threw the door open for me . " I 'm going to Bagnoli . Hop in . " When I was in and had closed the door , he waved to the Colonel  --  whom he did not know  --  made a U-turn , and we set off down the hill towards Mergellina . " So light to the croupe the fair lady he swung , So light to the saddle before her he sprung , " he recited , sing-song . I said , " I hope he does n't mind . The Colonel . " " How can he mind ? There are only two seats  --  and he would hardly expect me to take him instead . How can he mind ? " " You 'd be surprised how he can mind . " I was pleased with the turn my morning was taking , riding along in the sharp air without the Colonel . The man was breezy too  --  I had not seen him since the day of first meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described it to her , tightly furled . " Much has been said and written about the military mind . Nothing , however , harsh enough . " " They 're appalling , " I agreed . Then went on , mealymouthed , " I suppose one ought to be more tolerant . " " Why , pray ? I am a man , and everything inhuman is alien to me . All right , giggle away then . What 's he doing there , straddling your , doorstep ? " I wondered how he knew about my doorstep . I ex/plained how we lived , the Colonel and I , side by side . " He 's divorced , " I said . " So am I , " said Justin Tulloch . " Well . . . you 'll marry again . " " But will it be any different ? " He was more of an oddity than I 'd imagined , telling me these serious things in a kind of banter that made it difficult to know how to take them . I had a sense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I twisted round in the seat . " He 's right behind us . The Colonel . " The M.G. went faster . " She is won ! we are gone , over bank , bush , and scaur ; They 'll have fleet steeds that follow , ' quoth young Lochinvar . I hope that 's your favourite poem , " he said , " as it is mine , and that of every thinking person . " " I do n't like the part where he says about there being better-looking women who 'd be glad to marry him . " " There are maidens in Scotland more lovely by farWho would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar . ' Well , it was only a ruse . " " The sort of ruse , " I said , " that one would n't be likely to forget . " " True love , " said Justin Tulloch , " is the cultivation of forgetfulness . And do n't you forget it . In any case , I wo n't hear anything against Lochinvar . Listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took it up , He quaffed off the wine , and threw down the cup  --  ' No , I 'll not hear a word against it . As a Scottish Nationalist , which I happen to be . " I said nothing , and he went on , " You do n't believe it , but I am . " " I do believe it . " In fact it seemed very likely he might follow some unexpected cause of the kind . I fanciedhe was disappointed that I showed no surprise . " Have you moved from the hotel ? How did you happen to come past at this hour ? " Then it occurred to me that it was indiscreet to ask him this . " I expect to be in that hotel for months . I 've been at my Italian lesson , and was going  --  am going  --  to Nisida , about my lawful business . " On the enisled cape of Nisida , off Bagnoli , there were other offices , other officials . He said , " Write down your telephone number for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right : please write down your telephone number , I implore you to write down your telephone number . " " I do n't have a pencil and paper . " He took his left hand off the wheel and reached in his pocket . " There . As a matter your po-faced Colonel wants to keep you for himself . I did get your address . " He took the paper back from me . " What do you do in the evenings ? Do you have friends here ? " I told him about Gioconda , and how I had met them both on the same day.  |p62Justin  often drove me to work after that , and we began to see one another now and then in the evenings . There was a studied irregularity to our meetings , and if at any of them we particularly enjoyed each other 's company he would then stay away for a week , or two , or three , it was part of his neurosis of self-protection . I think that his anxiety to remain uncommitted had been aroused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment of his taking an interest in me , the one operating in conjunction with the other ; and made it impossible for him to be natural . The reserved , unaffected person with whom I had worked that December morning at the Hotel Royal was never again revealed to me : the more I was to know Justin , the further we were to get from his spontaneous , direct self , and the more enmeshed in badinage and circumlocution . Even his appearance was altered somewhat by dissimulation . I minded this only moderately . What I minded most was its being manifest and yet unmentionable . I was not as ready as his caution suggested to offer him , or anyone , the devotions of love : for that , I was at least as unready as he . The offence to my vanity in his casual exploitation of my company would , so I coolly felt , be avenged the first time he attempted to make love to me . Meantime I rather enjoyed his erratic companionship . I enjoyed something else , too  --  the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have just said ; the knowledge that I had ceased to be accommodating . I supposep63this is what is known as the loss of innocence . I had no cause to regret my lost innocence , for it had never done me any good : I have lived a much more virtuous life without it . It was extraordinary , though , the way Justin 's defensive , flippant tone imposed itself . One would find oneself falling into line , making elaborately absurd under- or overstatements to meet the mocking tone he set , using antiquated schoolgirl phrases to amuse him , describing a colleague as " a juggins , " saying " ripping " or " spiffing " or " jolly-dee . " Even to die was to " keel over , " just as to live was to " press on regardless . " This ironic jargon becamethe bond between us ; we operated , the two of us , in code . Cosy private jokes of language , used against themselves , were the sort of thing that , in leaving England , I had wished to escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a nostalgic  --  almost an anthropological  --  interest . That is something one does not foresee in wishing to elude one 's traditions : that the threat , once its fangs are drawn , may become transfiguredinto intimacy , a frame of reference . In the same way that the forms of social class , or of an oppressive religion , are retrospectively regarded with sentimental longing when  --  and simply because  --  their influence has been extinguished . Justin , when alone with me , talked quite a lot , often incorporating an instructive note into his whimsicalp64speeches . If he wished to terminate a conversation , he would wait till I began to deliver my own views and then cut me off in mid-sentence : it was one of his man-made defences , part of his plan of attack . Irritated at the beginning , I later would lead him on in order to observe his technique . One day he noticed , I think , from my smile that this was so , for he turned my face to his and said , " To grow older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shunned . " And when I did not answer , he urged me , " Do n't turn into a cool customer , Jenny . I do n't like it . " I told him , " When I was a warm customer , I was asked to cool off . " His greatest compliment was that I was " old-fashioned . " " There you go again , " he would say , but approvingly , of some judgment of mine , some turn of phrase . " What an old-fashioned girl you are , Jenny . " This was , I suppose , a tribute to the lost innocence ; but I looked on that , with my interesting new detachment , as something of which I still possessed merely the physical attributes  --  as at school , when I noticed that teachers found me particularly attentive and would sometimes address themselves exclusively to me , though my thoughts were all the time elsewhere : it must have been some accident of expression , or the unblinking nature of my adolescent stare . So with that impression of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to be no more than a habit I was beginning to grow out of . It would takep65time  --  a lifetime perhaps  --  to lose the outward aspect of an ingenuousness I no longer completely possessed . It was a deception I did not seek , but which I did nothing to dispel . My new awareness had not extended , as yet , to finding in all this anything to mourn , on his side or on mine . There was a larger reason for not minding this casual courtship of Justin 's , and that was the city itself . In our office , in those days , I was always aware of the city , like someone compelled at a dinner table to be attentive to a boring neighbour while listening all the time for the voice of a loved one at the other end of the room . Since I was willing to do any errand that took me into town , they sent me out every so often in the back of the Vehicle to buy cameos or corals for visiting generals , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called themselves the Culture Vultures . By these means I was able to meet Gioconda occasionally in the centre of town . Standing up at a counter we would have coffee , fierce black coffee , a spoonful apiece , served in tiny cold cups that were always wet from the draining board . Or she would take me , on some general 's behalf , to a source of table-cloths , or gloves , or tortoise-shell boxes . We made an expedition of the kind one bitter day towards the end of that year , when the Colonel sent me out to find him a genuine Christmas tree to replace the miniature nylon one that had been issuedp66to him . I do n't suppose the Colonel 's commission was as hilarious as it appeared to us , but I remember that Gioconda and I went together to Via Foria , where the trees were sold , giggling all the way like schoolgirls and wiping away tears of joy . The slain trees , niggard and meridional , lay about in dismal heaps in a little park there , and we walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands over an improvised brazier was astounded by our request for a better specimen , flinging his hands apart then quickly re-aligning them over the coals . He reminded us this was not Canada and advised me to take what was going  --  which I did , luggingit back to Bagnoli in the Vehicle . I had not had a female friend since childhood , and novelty made this one the more singular . Perhaps it was something the same for her . At her house , from time to time , I was to meet women she had gone to school with , a relative who lived at Vico Equense , two plump girls , twin sisters , with a curious English name that derived from the Napoleonic wars . She might recount to me a conversationshe had had at some dinner party or on the telephone , but the very diversity of these connections suggested that she had no single close friend  --  no friend , in fact , closer than I.For my part , I kept Gioconda to myself , as I had in writing to Norah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted her . I could have introduced her to Justin , but I feared his comments on Gianni  --  whom he quickly char/acterised , from my accounts , as a blatherskite . In the same way , Gianni would refer to this unknown acquaintanceof mine as " lo Scozzese , " as if a Scotsman were scarcely entitled to a name of his own . For Gianni , who was always urging me to extend my experience , resented even so mild a show of interest in any man other than himself . Gioconda 's English was excellent , though she had little use of it in Naples . Gianni spoke English poorly and rarely , though priding himself on idiomatic phrases that he always got wrong  --  the crucial word getting omitted or mispronounced  --  and which he would preface accusinglywith " as they put it in England , " or " as the English say . " ( Gioconda , on the contrary , would occasionallymake over-literal renderings into English , saying " belfry " for campanile , or " Saint Januarius " for San Gennaro ; and once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) They both spoke good French , and once in a while , curiously , they spoke it to one another . I suppose they wished sometimes to escape from the succession of trenchant ironies that are the conversational fate of cultivated Italians , but I noticed that this usually happened when they were in some way agitated  --  Gioconda , who detested the telephone , would call out , " Sois un ange , prends le telephone " if she heard the bell from an adjoining room ; or Gianni , berating her for some imagined shortcoming , would cry , " Mais to es bete , "  |p68reserving  for tenderer moments his Italian endearment , " Cretin . " There are things one will not say in one 's own language , they carry too much weight ; to have said them in another tongue is an extenuating circumstance , like being drunk or demented . So Justin , too , if he admired the style of my hair or the colour of my shawl , would be foolishly italianate , crying " Bellissima " or " Un amore " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Che bel colore . " Entering Gioconda 's flat late one Friday , I passed from room to room without finding her , at last hearing voices from the terrace . It was January and the days were then as fine as spring , but that was the first night mild enough to sit outside . The sight of the doors open to the evening expanded the terse , wintry sense of darkness instantly , luxuriously , into summer . On the threshold I heard their voices more clearly  --  but low , insistent , and speaking French . They were leaning on the balustradewith their backs to me , side by side but not , it was clear , together . Gioconda 's head was the lower ; Gianni 's was slightly turned to her as he talked . I could tell that they were quarrelling . And I realised that Gianni was asking something of Gioconda , and she was refusing him . It was dismaying to come upon them like that . A loss of equilibrium , frightening , like overhearing one 's parentsquarrel . For I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide me with a measure of stability . Of course Gianni gave Gioconda a hundred reasons a day to quar/rel with him , but the fact was that she never accepted the provocation , her love apparently directed to some idea of Gianni  --  some misconception as I saw it  --  more profound , more entire , that allowed her to overlook his irascibility as no more than a bad habit . I had got used to this imbalance , this counterpoise of their relations , and was beginning to depend on it as something immutable . More distressing still was the glimpse of Gianni as supplicant . As long as he had continued to antagonise me with his dictatorial ways , I had been required to consider him in no other light . Besides , there had been an infuriatingconsistency to him . Now I felt I might have to take account of something more , even to feel humiliated for him as one would not have felt for someone less committed to self-assertion . " Ne dis pas non , " he said to her , and put the flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Penses-y un peu . " Gioconda shook her head . I heard few words of what she said . " . . . deja .. . pourrait pas durer . " She trailed her forefinger along the convex railing in a preoccupiedyet conclusive gesture ; as she might have drawn it down the keyboard of a piano before closing the lid . Tosca , quietly letting me out , said merely , " Ah Signorinamia "  --  whether addressing me , or speaking of Gioconda , one could not know.  |p71HAVING  CLEARED my rooms , I started to add to themsmall objects of my own . Most Saturday afternoons were free now , and I would take a bus across the city to junkstalls ( the " junkies , " as Gianni in his English called them ) in Piazza Francese , or to antique shops in Via Costantinopoli , to buy a little painting on glass , or a shelf of flowers painted on gesso , or a piece of fissured majolica . Afterwards I might walk down into San Biagio dei Librai and spend an hour or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gianni was often there  --  usually dismissing my jugs and plates as rubbish ; at other times approving them but ridiculing the price which , according to him , no Italian would have dreamt of paying . " You might as well go to the swellies in Via Chiatamone , " he would cry , saying " swellies " in English and mispronouncing the name of the street to make an obscene pun , an allusion to the prostitutes who patrolled in the evening . " If you go to the junkies , you should payp72the junky price . " I could hardly conceive of paying less than I did  --  for the prices of these meaner fragments of the eighteenth century had not then begun to climb  --  and throughout that winter continued to visit the rigattieri , letting Gianni rave on about my gullibility . It was strange how one did let him rave on : one found oneself letting his complaints pass uncontested , just as Gioconda did . He had a knack of eliciting indulgence  --  or perhaps it was merely that Gioconda 's indulgence of him was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  with his fault-finding , his bragging , his ludicrousEnglish  --  quite as if , in return , he were making some immeasurable , compensating addition to our lives . One weekend of that New Year I came into Gioconda'shallway carrying my Castelli saucer , or jug of Montelupo wrapped in newspaper . The weather had turned cold again and I had walked down slippery streets through a bleak drizzle . Gioconda had a fire in her little room , and a streaked saucepan of coffee stood on the tiles in front of it . She had on an old polo-necked pullover blotched with paint ; her hair was uncombed , and she kept lifting wisps of it out of the neck of the sweater with her forefinger . " Gianni is n't coming this weekend , " she told me . " He has a big wheel there from America . " She briefly describedthis pezzo grosso , whom she had met once or twice when she travelled with Gianni to California  --  " sentimental , efficient , a cultured man who makes an affectation of crassness. "  |p73I  said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I liked it , " she said . " Though less than Gianni did . " " Gianni 's always saying he hated it . " " Well . . . you know . " Gioconda obviously consideredit a lapse of taste on my part , this holding of Gianni to his words . She said , " I liked the monuments . " I thought she must mean the sights , the landmarks  --  redwoods , Chrysler Building  --  but she went on , " The statues , I mean , of the national heroes . In Italy they 're usually riding chargers and brandishing swords . There , they are often in armchairs . " I thought this outrageous from a woman who had given herself to a man of action . She lifted her chin towards the window , indicating her own street . " In New York the buildings are silver , or white , or yellow , so smooth , so glossy , as if they were made of wax . " " All the same , I do n't see you living there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . That 's it  --  what we quarrel about , " she added , acknowledging my presence on that previous evening . " It 's too late for me to live in those countries , away from the discomforts of home . . . But I like the humour , the common sense . And there are so many harmless people : Italians are seldom harmless . And when they are at ease , those northernpeople , it means more than it does with us , it 's so pleasant that one wants to encourage them , to say , Smile , be natural '  --  the way one does taking a photograph , urging as natural the rarest expression of all . "  |p74She  fingered a loose stitch of her sleeve , drawing it out until it started to shred . " Gianni wants me to live in Rome . " Now she began to work the thread back into its place . " It 's logical , " she went on , as usual defending Gianni 's point of view . " If we could be married , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " " And since you ca n't be married , this is what you have . Being here is all you have . " " There you are . " She raised her eyes to mine . She smiled . " One stays here out of self-preservation . " She had expressed it precisely , for only by some extreme instinct of self-defence could she have resisted the natural wish for a common life with her lover . Apparentin their conversation  --  in the simplest enquiry , " Do you take mushrooms ? " or " Are these your gloves ? "  --  was the lack of a shared domestic life that all their greater intimacy could not replace . " And yet , " she said , " who would not wish , at times , to leave this place of poverty , to live where a street is not a corridor of want and filth and suffering ? Of course I would like to change , to get away : I too . " " You would miss it , then . " " Yes . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , or a person . To miss it . In fact , to go away , to put yourself in the state of missing , is sometimes the simplest way to preserve love . " " It seems to me something that Gianni would understand , your staying here . "  | " He does understand it . " " Then why does he make a quarrel of it ? " Gioconda looked at me . " You see , I am the one who quarrels . Because in Rome there are other women . . . There are other women . . . And he says that would stop if I came to Rome and lived with him . " She went on at once , to check her own distress , " Let 's have our coffee . " I brought over the tray that stood on her desk , and she poured coffee from the battered saucepan . The cups were veined , like my finds in Via Costantinopoli , but heavy with Victorian roses . Along Gioconda 's cheek , as she leant to fill them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine fracture in porcelain . " Luciana  --  my sister  --  lives at Nice in one of those flats , a glassed-in crow 's nest , that were the latest thing in the Thirties , modern by my standards , with heating and faultless plumbing , and a machine that does the washing . . . Her son attends the lycee , she has the day to herself . In the morning , walks to the esplanade , reads the paper in the cafe ; stops in , on the way home , at a lending library behind the Hotel Ruhl . In the afternoon , plays cards with a friend ; in the evening , watches television . Incredible as it may seem , none of this causes her to miss Naples . When she comes here , one sight of San Biagio is enough to have her longing for the shiny shop fronts of Nice , one day in this house has her yearning after her well-fitting windows and fuses that do not blow.  |p76Growing  up here , and the war , have been too much for her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her life . " After a moment she said , " That 's all wrong . I make it sound like nothing . " She sighed as though remonstrating with , as though patiently correcting , someone other than herself . She handed me my cup , and held the pot poised above her own . " Luciana 's husband belonged to a Resistancegroup that was formed in 1940 , at the fall of France . They called themselves Les Quarantes . In ' 43 he was taken by the Germans . She went to the prisons , trying to find where he was , if he was alive , if he was still in France . She did find him , at the prison in the BoulevardRaspail . They would n't let her see him , but she could take his washing and bring it back . She opened the seam of a shirt and put in the lead of a pencil and a slip of paper . The paper came back to her in another shirt : he had written on it , simply , J'ai /aim ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washing , and the guards laughed and told her , He wo n't need those any more . ' She fainted away on the floor , and they put her in the street . " She said , " Forgive me , it 's terrible . But I made it sound trivial before  --  the way she lives , and why . Sometimesit seems easier to cheapen things than remember them . " We were quiet . She poured her coffee , exactly as though the gesture had been arrested while she spoke andp77might now continue . I held my cup in both hands and sat back on the divan with my legs beneath me . I looked up at the opposite wall . " Gioconda , " I asked her , " who painted those white flowers ? " Gioconda stared up at the picture as if she sought the information from it . She sat back on the divan alongside me , and let the cat climb on to her knees . She drank , and each time she lowered her cup the cat peered shortsightedlyinto it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a street in Rome , centuries ago , long before the war . And he saw that painting through a doorway , it was inside a gallery . At first he thought it might be by De Pisis , but as he looked at it through the open door he could see it was not , and he went in to ask who the artist was . The dealer told him it was a young painter , very poor , who had a studio in a slum out near Porta Portese . My father wrote to the artist but there was no reply . He then went and called on him . " Gioconda began to stroke the cat , softly , downward , until it purred , as if it were a stringed instrument from which she could draw responses . " He found a young man , twenty-two , solitary as a scarecrow , with the speech of a poor Roman . . . He was entering a new phase of work , he said , and when my father told him he had bought the painting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished he had destroyed it . He showed my father some drawings , and a few canvases that werep78on stretchers against the wall , but he would part with nothing . He had a reason for keeping everything  --  this was from a series , that was unfinished , and so on . When my father left he seemed glad to see the last of him . " Gioconda tipped her head back against the wall , and went on , slowly strumming the cat . " The following day he came to the hotel where my father was staying and asked him to sell the picture back . My father took him to lunch in a restaurant , where they spent most of that afternoon . The picture was not mentioned again , and soon after that the painter came and spent some weeks here , at Naples . My parents made a studio for him in another part of this house . After a while he disappeared back to Rome , but always came again , turning up without a word , installing himself in the studio , seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while talking with my father all through the night . On the stairs or in the courtyard he would pass us , my sister and me , without a glance . Not proudly , you know , or humbly , but absorbed and apart . He was like a character from Turgenev , without postures , with no sense of role . " " What did he look like ? " She pursed her lips as if trying to remember . " Tall , for an Italian , particularly a poor one . Dark hair , even then receding . Clean-shaven . Dark eyes  --  dark , that is , and bright at the same time . He wore workman 's clothes , anything at all , and in winter a coat he had salvaged off some rubbish dump . Again , there was no pose in it , onlyp79poverty ; later on , when he began to have money , he ate more , bought himself warm clothes . . . Gradually he became less separate from us , using our names , occasionallyletting me run an errand for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bundle of rags . He used to borrow my father 's books , and that brought him into these rooms . He had two exhibitions , after a while , in Rome ; he was written about a bit in magazines . His became a name  --  not famous , but one of those names that people mention to show they are a la page ; that sort of thing , that world , was not so obvious then as it is now , at least to us , but he knew what it was and he kept clear of it . With those people , even one 's indifference to them has cachet ; for them , integrity itself must be a pose . " Eventually he was able to buy part of a fisherman 's house , south of Rome , at the tip of a long peninsula , and he went there to live . He still came here once in a while , and my father occasionally went to see him , sometimes taking me along . Now they are building a road to that peninsula , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could only go with difficulty , doing the last part of the journey by foot or on a donkey , or hiring a boat and going round the coast . You would n't believe how wild it was  --  isolated , beautiful . A warren of white houses , the sea in front , the hills behind , on either side a long empty shore of white sand , cactus , rocks , and Roman ruins . " My father and he were friends , in an outdated , an antiquated sense . They had a friendship of the kind menp80can no longer have . It would be too simple to introduce complexities , to say he was the son my father did not have , or the artist my father could not be , or to dwell in other ways on his attraction for my father . When I try to describe now , to you , their affection for each other , the only phrase I find is brotherly love . " She had ceased to accompany herself on the cat , which gathered itself up with its paws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thud , and stalked to the fire . Gioconda picked a few white hairs off her lap , lit a cigarette , and sat up cross-legged on the sofa , balancing her elbow on her knee and her cheek on her left hand . " He lived there at the sea in four great rooms like caverns , with rough , whitewashed walls , domed roof , stone floor . With no comforts , with luxuries of silence and time . The rooms were damp , bad for the pictures  --  and for him , since he had a history of tuberculosis . He had a stove in one room , and high up round the wall a sort of wooden gallery where the canvases were stacked . A worktable , a bed , a lamp , a chair . " Gioconda bent forward to shake her cigarette in an ashtray . " It came to me that my father would like us to marry . That is , he hoped I would fall in love . He encouragedit  --  not crudely , but in ways that were evident to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking only of such things  --  and I resented it . It put me off , as it must , always , as a matter of course . I would n't go with my father any more on those excursions that he made . "  | " And did he , the painter , did he care about you ? " " Those things are n't orderly , or precipitate , like stories . It all took time , too much time , to come about and then to reveal itself . I still saw him when he visited us , but I was distant with him . Ridiculous , I daresay . " How had she looked , that Gioconda of fifteen years before  --  a reserved girl with a dark , tender beauty , fatter or thinner than now , pensive or gay ? Looking at her , hunched forward at my side with the cigarette between her fingers , I dressed her in the fashion of the period , spreading her hair in wide little curls about her shoulders , squaring her sleeves and bodice , trying to divest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it adult . " Mussolini had declared war in the spring of 1940 . My father was dismissed from the university . Having detested the regime for years , he now became obsessed with it , it was his only subject . If we went to the cinema to divert him , there would be a newsreel , my father would be convulsed with rage , calling out in the theatre , " Ca f one ! Ca f one ! " The sight of me in school uniform  --  on which I had to wear , like other children , the fascist insignia  --  made him desperate . You will imagine the result of this . Anything might have happened . He was warned once or twice . Then his property was confiscated and we were sent into exile  --  one of those domestic exiles that were popular then , a species of detention in a remote part of Italy . What they were doing a century agop82in Russia under the Tsars  --  and are doing still ; what Mussolini called going forward . . . We were sent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contorted shapes of mountains and valleys seemed to have been intended as background for the convulsed lives we were living . We had a shanty at one end of the town , and helped on the land . Even such a place as that had its representatives of the secret police . " Gioconda was silent , and then began again almost loudly , as if reverting to a central theme from which she had strayed . " It was before this that they quarrelled , my father and the painter of this picture . Throughout the Thirties , during the time when they had perpetually discussed the prospect of horrors that were now coming to pass , they had conceived themselves , I suppose , to be in agreement . If he had told my father that he was un obiettore di coscienza  --  what 's the English expression , opposed to taking arms ? " " Same . Conscientious objector . " " Yes , if he had said that before , as he probably did , many times , then my father had not taken it seriously  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time came it would be different . When war broke out , he  --  the painter  --  was in any case exempt from military service because of having had tuberculosis ; at that time there were not these new drugs , of course , and he had never been completely cured . He stayed on at the sea working , perhaps more troubled even than my father by what wasp83taking place . He turned to himself again and became more as he was when we knew him first . Still he visited us while we remained at Naples , and now that was because of me . Are you cold ? " Gioconda got up and added a log to the fire , rasping it into position with jabs of the poker . She dusted her palms together and came back to me . A car started up in the courtyard , failed , and began again . " My father and he began to disagree . To my father it was indecent , in those circumstances , to shut oneself in a room . Any resistance , organized or futile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was the only course  --  to stay in one 's room and go on painting . He said , I am in the resistance ' . . . Then we were sent to the mountains , and we did n't see him for over a year . Not until my mother 's death . " The cat sat up on its haunches , showing its long , tufted underside , and sharpened its claws on an upholstered chair  --  plucking away as delicately and accurately at each of the upraised threads as if it were now , in its turn , pursuing the musical theme . " When my mother died , in our shack in the mountains , he somehow got word of it . He had been in Naples and heard of it through Tosca 's brother , whom he met in the street . He came to our village there  --  a fearful journey at that time , what with the war and the winter , and he did most of it on foot . " Gioconda lit another cigarette , and over it looked directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was describing . " We saw him coming from far off , like a pilgrim  --  truly like a pilgrim , for the word means one who approaches across the fields . . . We knew it was he . No one else ever walked like that , without the need to make any impression on the world , not even for the worse . " I thought of Gianni  --  his lordly strut , his straddling stance . " Of course it was reported . That he came . By then the authorities had more to think about and he got off with a warning , although when he returned to the house at the sea his studio had been torn to pieces . All through that year , while the war was changing , we had no word of him . When it became obvious that Italy would be invaded , my father tried to negotiate secretly , with a bribe , a passage for me through Italy into Switzerland , but that autumn the Germans closed the frontier . They put great nets there , against which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allied invasion came in the south , everything was confusion , at first we had to stay put . But the bombardment of Naples was unbearable . When we heard Salerno had fallen , we escaped from that village and made the journey , a hideous journey , home . " " How could your father bring you back here  --  my God , at that moment ? Was n't he afraid ? " " He was afraid of leaving me behind , afraid of what might happen if we stayed . I was older by then and would n't have remained without him anyway . When wep85reached Naples the worst was over  --  that is to say , the bombardment itself , for every other worst was to come . The city had been through all forms of privation , batteredfrom both sides . Degradation , wretchedness  --  you wo n't want to hear it again : for our generation , yours and mine , it is commonplace . Not only what was suffered , but what suffering brought people to . The terribledetails , that have always been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city was under blackout , you know that the Vesuvius was in eruption , the entire region irradiated with a red glow that could be seen for a hundred miles . . . It was a real hell we were in , bathed in red , overhung by a sky of ash , smelling of fire and brimstone . The mountain was weird , wonderful , the slopes flickering with the sparks thrown up by molten lava . Oh Jenny , while all this was going on , thousands of the poor got into little boats and rowed out to Capri . There was nothing for them there , no way to keep themselves , nothing to eat , they had to come back . It was just an instinct , immemorial , useless , as an animal might step to a mound of higher ground in a tidal wave . " We lived through it , more easily than most . When the occupation of Rome was completed , the painter came to Naples , came to see us again . . . on a bicycle . He stayed some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not credit he would still keep outside of what was happening . The resistance in Italy had taken on enormous proportions by then . The countryside north of Rome wasp86infiltrated with saboteurs , with soldiers who had deserted the Axis , with escaped Allied prisoners . My father could not believe in any scruple that would exempt a young man from taking part in this . Ultimately  --  they spoke bitterly to . one another , and they parted . " " And you  --  what did you think ? " " I was young , on those matters I only played at thinking . I had always thought what my parents thought . Now , it seems to me as if time , and other wars , and other wickedness , are on the painter 's side . But retrospect is not the same as the event , and that was not like other wars , except in some final , historical perspective ; and there is something chilling in a historical perspective consistently applied to daily life . " So it was , " Gioconda went on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " just at the time when my father never wanted to see this man again , that his original wish was fulfilled and I fell in love . These consequences , these fulfilments , Jenny , these hopes that turn back and terrify you with their consummation . We could hardly ever meet , we could n't correspond , yet by the end of the war we were lovers . " " And your . father ? " " My father came to hate him . For him it was passivity that had allowed Mussolini to have power , and this  --  premeditated  --  inaction was inexcusable to him . Perhapshe was right . One can not live one 's own posterity . " Her voice accelerated , as if there remained only one itemp87to conclude the story . " I went there , to that place on the sea  --  I went there to live with him . I broke with my father . We lived there together for a year , just over a year , the whole year of ' 46 . " She had made a cradle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " One day he took a boat , and went to Gaeta . For some errand . It was easiest to go there by boat , as I have said . The boat had a small engine , but half-way there it must have failed . " Must have ' released a thrill of fear in me , like the prospect of physical pain . " There were oars in the boat . He had to row to shore . He found a sandy place among the rocks where he could land . He pulled the boat up the shore  --  and on to a mine . " In the early darkness the room was contracting . On the window-ledge a pigeon was winding itself round and round and round like a top . " Gioconda , " said I. " Gioconda . " She lifted her hand from her breast to make a show of her own acceptance ; to make her history bearable to me . At last she continued , " I think that killed my father , the war reaching back like that and taking him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seemed , once more , intended , ordained , after the refusal to engage in it . How it lay in wait for him , that violence , the useless death he had shunned for others and for himself . Another terrible fulfilment . My father came there and took mep88away . I have never been back . He saw to everything . There were the paintings  --  some belonged to a dealer , others went to the family  --  for he still had his family in Rome , his father serving at an osteria in Trastevere . Some I kept . My father did everything . We went on , for a dreadful year , together , here in this house . Then he took sick . At first it was said to be an ulcer , but it was cancer , I suppose , from the beginning . In a few months he was dead . The war  --  in its way , it killed him too . " She said , in another of these asides that were like a drawing of the breath she needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it this way , now , to you , it all comes out as if there were some sequence , some logic , instead of moods , contradictions , alternatives . The design imposes itself afterwards . And is false , must be false . " Then I wrote that book , you know , Del Tempo Felice . During the last months of my father 's life . I only knew I must live as long as he was alive . So it was , in a way , as though we both were dying , my time running out along with his . In sleep I would tell myself all that had happened so I would n't wake up thinking myself still there  --  at that place  --  because remembering happiness was the worst of all , just as the poets say . In suffering , everything is as the poets say . . . Memory was intolerable , I had to set it down , even though that engendered more memories , more and more memories . It was as if I had to get it all done before some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bed at the hospital writing it on my knee ,  |p89unwilling  to stop even when he asked me to read a book or a newspaper to him . . . " Tears at last flowed over her face and she inclined her cheek to her woollen shoulder to rub them off . " I would write it while I ate , while I was falling asleep , while I sat in the bus . It was finished just after my father 's death . " She looked at me again . " It was then that Gianni came . And saved my life  --  as they say . " Gioconda , in adding this last phrase , sought to detract from the drama , the melodrama , of what she said enough to allow of its yet being uttered . " What you see  --  is nothing . No more than a dress of mine is me . He understood entirely . . . entirely . It was a rescue . I had transmitted my message , like a castaway , without hope . Then I was sent for and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She repeated , as she had of her father , " He did everything . " She said , " He devoted himself to me , to that work of mine . How can one explain ?  --  it did not happen in spite of my loving someone else , it was because of my experience that we loved each other . " " Like Othello , " I said . " Only the other way round . She loved me for the dangers I had passed , And I loved her , that she did pity them . ' " Gioconda got up and crossed the room . She took an envelope out of a drawer of the desk and brought it back to me . There was no trace of her tears at all . She might have been an acquaintance casually showing me the snapshots of some holiday , so expertly had she controlledp90herself . In the envelope were three photographs of a cadaverous man in a heavy sweater leaning against a chalky wall . There was one picture of Gioconda , the Gioconda of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , standing on a beach with her hands behind her back and her bare feet together : it was the stance of a prisoner , but the fresh young face was alight with laughter . Gioconda replaced the photographs in the envelope , keeping back for an instant the clearest of them and holding it for me to see . " Gaetano , " she said . " His name was Gaetano . " She put the envelope back and closed the drawer . She switched on the lamp that stood on the desk , and we looked at each other anew in the light of her experience . I was convinced she had not spoken like this before , at least not at such length , or dispassionately . Words would have been as presumptuous as an embrace : yet the inadequacyof silence was painful . Trapped in our thoughts and our afterthoughts , we have no impulses left to serve us on such occasions . She said , " When people say of their tragedies , I do n't often think of it now , ' what they mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colours everything . Because the idea of Gaetano is always with me , I 'm less shocked now , when I suddenly come upon some reminder of him , than I was long ago when he still seemed a grief I must get over . Even a few years back it could still bep91terrible . In New York , one day , I went into a gallery  --  one of those dealer 's shops with lots of light and carpet . I had really gone in to get warm  --  it was a freezingday . And on the wall there was a picture of his , painted just after the war . La Ginestra  --  what 's that , in English ? " " The gorse . No , the broom . " " I had been buying things  --  you know , presents from America . I was carrying all the packages in a big paper bag . The girl at the desk kept saying , Check your shoppingbag . Check your bag , Miss , ' and I was staring at his yellow canvas across the room . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they should forbid the paintingsto touch you . " She turned her palm outward to me . " It was nothing unpredictable , was it , after all ? But then I felt it like violence done to me . Gianni and I had just become lovers . Oh God , now I 've upset this ashtray  --  it 's all right , nothing 's alight . It 's all gone out by now . Well , I wanted to pay some tribute . I could n't leave ' without  --  as it were  --  laying my wreath at this MadisonAvenue shrine . . . " " What , then ? " She smiled . " I asked the price . Such are the gestures of modern love . It was a means of recognition  --  to have the girl take her eyes off my shopping bag for a moment and consult a list , stumble over Gaetano 's name , pronounceginestra ' as if it were a hospital for women 's diseases . . . For a moment I made them defer , un/knowingly , to my grief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gallery even swam out of the wings somewhere , on hearing my question , and came up to me as though I were a bride . " She got to her feet , began to brush at her skirt with both hands . She said , " It 's all wrong , what I 've told you , " as she had said of her sister 's story . " But I can come no closer to it . "  |p93I  HAD BEGUN by then to treat the city with a show of familiarity ; pretending , as people do with a celebrated acquaintance , to know it better than I did , inserting myselfinto its landscape , another figure in its vast presepio ; acquiring habits of cafes and buses and hairdressers , uttering casual observations that sounded on my own ears exotic as examples from a phrase-book : " There is snow on the Apennines " or " Capri is always clearer in bad weather . " The assets of Naples are so secret , they give the impression of having been deliberately concealed ; lodged away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some squalid recess , they partake of the city 's poverty . Rarely do they give the sense , as do the historic sights of other cities , of having died and been resurrected : from that illustrious after-life their own vitality , their capacity for adaptation has excluded them ; they are engulfed in their own continuity . It is the people , not the monuments , of Naples who arep94blatantly featured , every face a subject for study  --  physiognomyevincing , like architecture , here the Spanish influence , there the Arab or the Greek . Civilisation has come upon them like one of their own cataclysms , flowingwith ungovernable impetus down channels of its own creation  --  in some respects total , all-permeating ; in others leaving inexplicable areas of innocence , of rusticity . For there would occur , in that immensity of independentactions , incidents that might have taken place in a village , or in some small town cut off from any novelty or tide of history . I remember that one evening I was looking in a shop window in Piazza dei Martiri  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velvet , scarves of satin flowers , Parisian stuff at odds with its southern setting  --  and turned to find at my back a young couple , modestly though not poorly dressed , the girl in grey , the man wearing a broad black armband . Like a deputation they awaited me , timidly excusing themselves before coming out with their question , " Are you Norwegian ? " And , when I was not , excused themselvesonce more  --  " Only we heard  --  you know  --  that Norwegian women were all fair , and with light eyes . . . " It was inoffensive curiosity of the kind one might feel on finding a rare bird in one 's garden  --  merely the desire to fix its identity before it disappeared forever . Yet it was , mysteriously , this same simplicity that grandly , gracefully expressed itself in the hairdresser'sp95sturdy little shampoo girl when , sweeping my hair back into the washbasin with her plump arms , she praised its colour and abundance with the comment , " Come la Maddalena "  --  this " Like the Magdalen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flattering comparison with some film star . The history and geography of calamity had so worked on these people that the excitement attending any public disaster was fundamentally devoid of surprise  --  if anything , there was an element of relief in the rupturing of an apparently continual suspense . Once , walking in a narrow street ( it was Via Carlo Poerio , that has since blossomed into a rank of boutiques but then was strung with greengrocers and salumerie , dealers in wrought iron and kapok , and any number of minor junkies ) , I had crossed to look into an antique shop , when the ground was shaken by a tremendous crash , and I spun round to find that the entire facade of an old palazzo had collapsedinto the street , flattening a parked car . From premonition , or from some preliminary sound , I had turned at the very moment of the impact , in time to see the shower of fragments sparking upward in a cloud of plaster-dust . No one was hurt . The car  --  so instantly and totally crushed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore on its hollowed roof a heap of mortar , gesso , and masonry , topped by one of the stone garlands that had decorated an upper window and now lay on the summit of the pyre like a wreath on . a tomb.  |p96There  was an interval of complete , cautious silence before the street 's inhabitants came out to look . Far from causing indignation , the catastrophe produced any numberof shrugs . " Che hub ? " they enquired of one another , " What do you expect ? " What might be expected , apparently , was just this  --  that the front of a building might fall off at one 's feet . Somebody at last went off to telephone the fire brigade , children started to scale the eminence of masonry and car . When interest had all but subsided , a placid-looking matron revived it by suddenly waving her arms and shrieking , " Danger , danger ! "  --  the word pericolo uttered exactly as if it were spelt " breegolu . " It was this sense of catastrophe , impending and actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alleviation out of every small diversion or absurdity . The background of adversity , against which all else was to be posed , manifested itself involuntarily in attitude and gesture , in figures of speech , or in the mannerism , habitual as a tic , of warding off the evil eye ; in the endless invoking of a patience with which they had been over-endowed in the first place , and which they pronouncedalmost as if it were the word for madness ; in an old woman crying after a boy who had jostled her , " A fine consolation you are . " The city itself was marked by a volcanic extravagance . Its characteristics had not insinuated themselves but had arrived in inundations  --  in eruptions of taste and pe/riod , of churches and palaces , in a positive explosion of the baroque ; in an outbreak of grotesque capitals , or double geometrical staircases ; in a torrent of hanging gardens poured down over terraces and rooftops , spilt along ledges and doorsteps . The very streets were composed of blocks of lava , dark rivers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sea of ceramic tiles and marble intarsia : the word lava itself , in its volcanic sense , had originated at Naples . The Neapolitan painters had flashed through every considerable edifice of the town , leaving the place awash with Solimenas and Luca Giordanos and Lanfrancos , a flood-tide of decoration that rose over walls and across ceilings . Nothing in moderationmight have been the motto of these people ; who were yet , like their city , ultimately a secret . Ordinariness , the affliction and backbone of other cities , was here non-existent . Phrases I had thought universal  --  the common people , the average family , the typical reaction , ordinary life  --  had no meaning where people were all uncommon and life extraordinary ; where untraceable convulsions of human experience had yielded up such extremes of destitution , of civilisation . Throughout the city there were inexhaustible sources of this or that  --  little fonts and geysers of commodity or personality : one street provided all the stringed instruments , another all the holy pictures , another all the funeral wreaths , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ macabre jokes ; the Albergo deip98Poveri of the grimmest legends . And on New Year 's Eve , in a revolting ritual , every window flung forth its annual accumulation of major garbage , burying the city under tons of broken utensils , plastic ornaments , cracked bottlesand empty tins , from which , each January , it was slowly re-excavated by the street cleaners . After I moved to the Posillipo I employed a girl called Serafina , who came to me each morning and stayed half the day , returning sometimes in the evening , if I had guests . For this slender Serafina , the word was wiry . Her flat figure and reedy arms suggested tough fibres and filaments , her hair was tightly crinkled from the scalp into resilient spirals . Her handsome , Semitic profile never smiled , but full-face she expressed a tenacious , embittered humour . There had been , still was , a husband to whom Serafina had been married at fifteen ; who now lived and worked at Salerno . To the question as to whether she ever visited him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " La grana "  --  that the journey was too expensive ; but she seldom spoke of him and I think that there was also lack of inclination . In order to arrive before I left for work , she came very early , and many of our conversations took place through the bathroom door  --  or as I dressed , carrying my coffee about with me from room to room and searching for my earrings or my shoes . I would call out remarks and questions , and back would come her responses soft and de/liberate as in church . She felt herself under an obligation to modify my opinions  --  as if , as a foreigner , I were not qualified to form definite views , even on the weather . If I commented on the cold , she would reprove me , " Not so bad " or " It 's the season for it , " and a moment later I would hear her calling out the kitchen window to a workman or a neighbour , " Cold enough to split your nails . " If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landing stage below , Serafina would counter my groans with " Si divertono , poverini , " at the very instant that she opened the terrace doors to bawl down at them " Tant'ammuina ! " In the same way she was a confusion of experience and naivete . Product of a one-room upbringing in a family of the bassi , survivor of war at Naples , yet she was favourably impressed by the fact that I did not smoke , and shocked that I treated animals as if they were Christians ; and would fearfully cross the road when approaching the church that housed the exorcised Devil of Mergellina . Gianni complained a lot about Serafina , as if in engagingher I had been short-changed on the Neapolitan character . " How did you manage to have the only maid in Naples with no personality ? Why do n't you get yourselfsome nice Concetta or Mafalda  --  " he indicated with both hands what shape this replacement would take  --  " instead of this length of string ? Women can be divided , more or less , into cows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wondered if , on one of his trips to my kitchen for ice or soda , he had tried to kiss her and been repulsed . No amount of female receptiveness could have propitiatedGianni , no revenge appeased him . The story of his mother , who had consigned him at the age of nineteen to a five-year term among the merchants , civil servants , and cannibals of Africa was told again and again , always as if for the first time as the sense of outrage sprang up freshly in his heart . " The diseases , then . The climate , the conditions  --  I am speaking of thirty years ago . When people say of such a life It was murder , ' they are only speaking the truth . This was murder , she tried to kill me . " His eyes would become bright with tears ; and I thought of Rimbaud . Gianni 's parents had separated when he was a , baby , the mother remaining at Rome with two children , the father sailing for Argentina where he had inherited some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy for the first time , coming from New York to Palermo on a cruise ship , and Gianni went to Sicily . to meet him . " It was damned queer , I can tell you  --  standing there on the dock thinking you were about to see your father for the first time . And then the odd thing of seeing him not as your father but as just another person  --  in a way that practically nobody ever does see their own parents  --  as if he were simply an acquaintance one might have made . Getting much the same impression asp101anyone might get meeting such a man . Thinking of him as somebody one might do business with , someone a woman might love . Oh it was queer , all right . Damned queer . " " What was he like ? " " Good-looking . Bold . Debonair , you might say  --  courtly . He was over seventy , in marvellous shape . His clothes were n't right  --  but that was America . He was moved , coming back to Italy . Palermo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could tell he was horrified , not having seen war . We went to have lunch at that hotel on the sea , outside the town . It was March , trees were in leaf , flowers were blooming , the sea was blue . He put his napkin over his eyes and cried . " Gianni 's father had spent some weeks in Italy and returned to Argentina , where he died the following year . " Having seen him only in old age , I ca n't picture him any other way  --  if I imagine him as a student , or courtingmy mother , or at my christening , he is always seventyfiveyears old . I ca n't help it . " Gianni had one brother , much older than he . " A horror . I have n't seen him in five years . " Something extraordinary was that Gianni never mentioned his wife . Once in a while he would speak of his children , two adolescent boys and a little girl , and I knew from Gioconda that he saw them constantly . But of his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to his former life with her . On the other hand ,  |p102he  often mentioned his mother-in-law , whom he fiercely hated , pointing out a harsh-faced woman in the street as resembling her , or telling me , if I gave a sharp response to one of his admonitions , " You 're getting to be like my mother-in-law . " I came to wonder whether this mother-inlawwas not in fact his own wife in disguise , and if he had transferred to her the character of his wife in order to speak of her so often and in such derogatory terms . Never mentioning his wife made her seem , inevitably , more secret , more sacred . Of his work , too , he would speak only indirectly . " This thing , " he would say . " This thing that I do . " Duringthe war , for example , the air force had set him to making documentary films , " as I had already started , then , to do this thing . " Wildly authoritative on every other subject , about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of introducing his stories , setting the scene like a playwright or a poet  --  or a director of films . " Place des Ternes. 1949 . June , cold and wet . " Or " Milan , high summer , a city deserted . Via Melzi d'Eril  --  a boulevard whose trees disappeared in a single night of the war , cut down for fuel : the street now  --  too wide , too bare , you sense something missing , eliminated . A fourth-floor apartment , shuttered , silent , like all the Sundaysof the world combined . . . " Occasionally these stories led to something more  --  more , that is , than their foregone conclusion , which wasp103the conquest of a woman or the exposing of some pretension ; and one felt then precisely the same agreeable surpriseone feels at an unexpected show of talent during a trite play.

My firm sent me to Munich to learn German , which they already foresaw as a useful language  --  looking ahead , you might say , though not quite far enough . I never could learn it , but that 's another story . I was boarded with a family in Munich , the wife half Italian , the husband German . When I had been there a few days , utterly lost , bored to death , I went alone one evening to the theatre . I forget the play . In the interval , something happened . The lights went up more strongly , people got to their feet excitedly , began talking , gathered in groups in the aisles . Armfuls of newspapers were brought in and passed around . I saw the headline , right across the page : ROEHM VERHAFTET . ' I had n't the remotest idea what it meant . ROEHM VERHAFTET . ' It was Hitler 's coup , the beginning of a massacre . I could n't ask anyone , not speaking a word of German . I knew something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sense of vast calamity that makes itself felt like a chemical agent , even to those who are cheering it on . " Well , that was what the whole war was to me . Anp104unnatural light , the performance suspended , and people milling about in an atmosphere of disaster uttering crucialwords that I found incomprehensible . In 1940 I was called up , I went into the air force . " Gianni shrugged at me , and added belligerently , " What else was I to do . Not being a hero , you might say , I had to go and fight . I did n't have money to buy my way out , as some did , and you had to be a fascist to get yourself a protected occupation . " " Figlia mia , " he would say , laying his hand on my arm or my knee . " I am not yet an old man , and in my time I have lived through  --  " now raising his hand and striking his fingers one by one  --  " the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war of Italy with Ethiopia ; Italian intervention in the Spanish Civil War ; and the Second World War . I have seen allies alternate with enemies , sometimes within the same war . Are you asking  --  " ( I was not ) " that I should continue to take these events seriously ? " When Gianni dealt with matters of this kind  --  when he told his stories , or sang , or came to grips in any other way with human feeling  --  he wept . That is to say that his eyes filled , and tears sometimes appeared on his face . He was proud of these tears , making no attempt to concealor remove them , even exhibiting a little this irrefutableevidence of his tender heart . It was as if he said to us ; Well , there you are : you think me callous and egotistical , yet here are the springs of compassion wellingup before your , very eyes.  |p105But  tears are not , like blood , shed by all involuntarily and according to the same determinants . And I had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions then , whether those who have suppressed or diverted the course of strong feeling are sometimes left immune , with nothing more than just such superficial traces of what was once a great affliction . If , for instance , at this time when all my faculties seemed blunted  --  not only by grief and change , but by the very effort of surviving them  --  if , as I say , I recalled a poem or a piece of music , a choking emotion might prevent me from completingthe passage , even in my head ; this happened automatically , as if the words or notes were some signal that drew up passionate response without reference to my own sensibilities . I would , uselessly , attempt to arouse the same reaction for a more immediate cause , for my own troubles or for sorrows witnessed : but I was like a person who has come down from a mountain or a long air journey , and is slightly deafened . Yet a line from a sonnet , a phrase from a sonata , drew tears as involuntary as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I concluded that Gianni 's tears were the refined product of a conditioning that was similar , but self-imposed and lifelong . Gioconda , for instance , had an astonishing memory for verse  --  I have never heard anything like it ; and would sometimes say lines to us , or whole poems , that were unknown to me : it was through her that the Italian poets entered my consciousness  --  or , rather , that I en/tered theirs . It was the one thing in which Gianni allowed her to shine , never interrupting unless to offer a word if she hesitated , sitting back with his hands locked under his head and one foot crossed over the opposite knee . And throughout these brief recitations of hers , he would always . weep . Afterwards , if we went late to dine together , perhaps , in one of the trattorie around Piazza Dante , he would  --  with his eyelids still reddened from crying  --  drive me crazy by abusing the waiter , sending back the carafe of wine , and criticising Gioconda 's dress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he also shed tears at the cinema , and showed a disproportionate concern for insects.  |p107SPENT  most of the war in England . That was the frightening part . It was a relief to get to safety , when they sent me on active service  --  when I went to Mombasain ' 44 . Up till then I was getting blitzed at a naval station in the south of England , at Hove . When I was called up I filled out a form . It asked me where I would like to be sent if I had a choice , and I put HOME . ' Perhapsthey mistook the handwriting , because I was sent straight to Hove and got stuck there for three years . Or perhaps some Johnny was having a joke  --  there were still a few humorous types around in those days . It was the war wiped the smile off our faces once and for all . " At the very end of it , in ' 45 , they sent me to the Falkland Islands . That was the worst  --  though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . There 's a freezingwind there that comes straight from the South Pole and never stops blowing . The place has a demeaning kind of desolation , the flat , bleak kind , not dignified by drama . There was one single tree there , a stunted , heel/ing wretch of a tree , that had become the focus of attention  --  I think we had all transferred our identities to that tree , and its survival in such a place was bound up with our own . There were a few women , Englishwomen who had been stranded there throughout the whole war  --  war was like a great syphon that sprayed human beings all over the globe ; as you know , Jenny . These women were reduced to lining the perishing remnants of their clothes with newspaper . . . Of course no one could get interested in these kinds of hardships , with what had been going on elsewhere in the world . And the worst hardship was exactly that  --  the knowledge that one 's sufferings were of no interest . " When Justin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass it off merely with a word or a look of agreement , and would have liked to recognise his wish of being , for once , serious with me . But he had so accustomed me to flippancy that I scarcely knew how to make the transition with him  --  and , having made it , might find him already reverted , no longer in earnest , so that my spontaneity was humiliated . More than that , I resented it  --  that it should be he , always , who set the tone of our relations . I forget , on this occasion , what I said , but I remember his taking exception to it . " You tell me I must talk sense , and when I do you dismiss me . " " Having imposed the climate of non-sense , you ca n't expect to be taken in earnest the moment you ring thep109bell . You treat me  --  things  --  us  --  lightly , then expect us to reverse ourselves the one time you choose . You want us to be accessible , indefinitely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be . " " His jaw dropped , " said Justin , at once relapsing into banter . " It is the price I pay , he said heavily . " I said , " It is one of the prices he pays . " We were walking down a dark street paved in uneven blocks , and had to keep our eyes on the ground  --  I think that Justin had come with me on one of my shoppingexpeditions , and we were going to see a church that was on our way home . It was often this way when we talked  --  we were driving or walking , instead of facing one another in a quiet room , or in a bed . Because of that , anything we had to say was transmitted with involuntary sidelong looks that heightened the glancing , facetious character of our friendship . It might have been different face to face , when expression would have counted , and less would have had to be spelled out , or evaded , in words . In the church , unexpectedly , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their heads prayerfullybowed over guidebooks , like so many Hamlets on their way to encounter Polonius . This also was part of our fate , Justin 's and mine  --  just as we were often in motion during our conversations , so too we were bound to arrive at destinations and to part , or be otherwisep110distracted . The church itself , a veritable grotto of the rococo , mocked all indignation . I smiled to close the subject  --  though not quite , for I remarked , " We are always at cross purposes , then . " Justin , looking around at the gilded and encrusted interior that was tipped inwards with its weight of decoration , remarked of it , " Hardly a case of less is more '  --  would you say ? " Then turning to me , " Asyngamy , my dear Jenny , " he said ; and repeated it . " Asyngamy . The inability of two plants to achieve cross-pollination , owing to their unsynchronised development . That is our case  --  a matter of bad timing , nothing more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the altar , we turned and slowly walked back down the aisle . " Since , in spite of this nuptial march you and I are taking , neither of us appears to wish at this time to enter into any **26;11177;TOOLONG . " We paused , looking about us , and he said , " These frescoes are by a painter whose nicknamewas Quick-Work , ' did you know that ? " and we left the church . It was an evening of late winter , charged with the smell of wood-smoke , shiny with wet streets . Women came past us , covering their mouths against the mild air with the edge of a shawl or a coat lapel , hauling along short schoolboys with long bare legs . A man came by with his hands in the air , telling his companion , " She was so lovely , he so much in love . . . " There was  --  as there often was , there  --  the sense of an earlier time : itp111was not merely the lack of modernity  --  the chaste black dresses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient places  --  but truly as if the city had not caught up , had no interest in catching up , was dawdling in some previous era , the turn of this century perhaps , or of any century . In silence we climbed a straight street lined with cavelikelittle dwellings of single ground-floor rooms , each scarcely accommodating its vast bed ; each marked by Mussolini twenty years before as unfit for habitation  --  his incontestable plaque now rotting , half-effaced , on the pitted outer wall . At the top of the street , Justin hailed a taxi . When we had found our niche in a traffic jam , Justin asked me , " Am I right ? " " About the frescoes ? " " About the cross-pollination . " " Once again , the very way in which you speak about these things affects one 's reaction . How could one love  --  " I saw that he did not like this bold word , and repeatedit  --  " that is , fall in love with , such an exponent of the arm's-length technique ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking . " It would have to be , would it , straight from the heart ? Someone who would bring you armfuls of flowers , and be cut in pieces for you ? " " That 's it . " " A modest enough requirement , " he agreed . " Youp112deserve nothing less , Jenny , a lass like you . And try to get that into your head . " There was something about this that recalled Norah 's way of trying to undermine your confidence  --  " You must believe in yourself more , " she would say ; " If only you knew how interesting you are , " exhortations with which , by imputing to me an ineptitude of manner , she assigned to herself as always the superior role . For a moment I forgot about Justin , and thought of Norah and how sometimes , when Edmund was away , she would come round in the evening to look over my life , running a metaphorical finger around the edges of my existence to examine it for dust . " It is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget that love does not come from the head . In fact , some of it gives the impression of being painstakingly mindless . " But in sayingthis I was thinking not of Norah but of Gioconda . It was inconceivable to me that she , who might have commandedanything from life , should be glad of the sort of love that Gianni gave her . In telling me her story Giocondahad said of Gianni , " He saved my life . " And there are debts of this kind  --  if debts they be , since Gianni 's intervention was not disinterested , nor was Gioconda 's feeling for him solely one of gratitude - that in a literal sense can never be paid ; one may have performed a hundred services greater than the original one ; yet the initial obligation , being spontaneous and unaccountable , will go perpetually , monstrously , undischarged . Thus thep113pain that Gianni caused Gioconda was , in her view at least , the sort of remedial destruction one can scarcely complain of  --  like damage done by the water used to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Municipio , and reached the rise behind the Royal Palace  --  an intersectionwhich , with the combination of castle , palace , opera house , and arcade , is as close as Naples ever comes to the civic and historic coherence of other large cities : a relief to tourists , and an anomaly to the inhabitants who feel themselves exposed there on that tract of open ground , and tend to avoid it . Justin asked , " Is there a possible restaurant round here ? Let 's hop out . " " You know they 're all terrible . " We stopped the car and made our way through the traffic and into the Galleria . Couples milled about us , arm in arm . Justin 's hand at my elbow was lifeless , worse than dutiful . We were early  --  first , in fact  --  in the little place where we went to dine . The owner scraped out our chairs for us , crying " Buona sera , buona se , " as if he had hardly expected the pleasure of having customers ; as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeting in return . " Now come Jenny , " he said . " Even Shakespeare made fun of the Neapolitan accent . " Pouring purple wine into thick , clouded tumblers , he remarked , " The thing is , Jenny . The thing is . Much of what we discuss is currently meaningless to me . Not human affairs alone ,  |p114but  other matters as well . The seasons , for instance  --  even the seasons bore me . . . And the very word Love which just now you so brashly used  --  that word is the greatest bore of all to me . At this moment , as one might say , women delight not me . " I thought of his hand on my arm and wondered , was he passionless , perhaps ; or effeminate . " Nor men either , though by your smiling you seem to say so . " The menu came , a limp paper elaborately illegible in mauve ink , enclosed in soiled plastic . We shared it , leaningacross our tiny table , and Justin touched his head companionably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees around is not encouraging . The doomed attractions , impossible unions . Though I do n't really call those love . " " Then you do wrong , Jenny . " For the moment abandoninghis quotations , he said , " You are mistaken . All that which you deplore  --  the blind obsession , the unequalsacrifice , the punishment invited and inflicted  --  that is love . Believe me . It 's pointless to call upon perfect harmonies and deathless romance . For love , you must look closer to home . " We ordered our meal . Justin broke a hunk of bread and gave me half of it . " Those in love  --  do they ever talk about it in this way  --  as we are doing , as if it were susceptible of logic ? Of course not . It is like the exemplarytreaties on whaling  --  ratified by everyone whop115is not involved . Those concerned are not signatories , and the whale will be exterminated as a matter of course . I believe the Japanese will knowingly harpoon the last blue whale . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though all manner of laws and arguments be ranged round to prevent it . " His plate arrived , a dish of rubbery seafood becalmed in red sauce . I said , " You 're too much influenced by your own ex-perience . " " Not the whole story , eh ? " " By no means . " " What do you know about it ? " He smiled , but it was an unworthy answer . He wished to conclude , now , this talk of love . He took up his fork and probed the contents of his plate . " Good stuff , this . I most willingly partake of it . " " You try to make me partake of your disillusionment , " I said . " However , I do n't hold it against you . " " His brow  --  as they say  --  cleared . " But when we came out of that place , and started to walk past the palace in the direction of the seafront , Justin reverted to the nature of our friendship . " We are both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that it ? Have been deprived of something and are in a state of abeyance . Can afford to be fastidious , having insufficient courage , at present , to be otherwise . " I agreed . Though he was more like someone who hasp116had an operation and waits to see whether the disease is cured , or mortal . And love not being , as he had just pointed out , rational , might he not at any time have becomeits victim over again , the more unguardedly for all this interim rationalisation ? Turning into Via Santa Lucia we stopped on the slope to watch the passage of a truck stacked high with refuse , from the summit of which a pair of seated urchins pontifically saluted us . " Oh Jenny , how will we explain it to anyone , when we get out of here ? " " We never will . No one ever has . " We walked on , our shoulders touching . " I was brought up to think of Naples , if at all , as superstition , sentiment , glee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cynicism , gloom , amorality  --  is just as much a myth , only a more pretentious one . The sort of platitude that calls itself a theory . Simply to know the worst about a place is not to know it . What is it then ? Civilisation , curiosity completely satisfied , style , irony , magnanimity . . . Being able to greet the world like a king from the top of a dunghill . " We stopped again , at the curb , and looked back up the street , and Justin laughed . " The tourist who comes and sees this shambles , has his camera swiped , is swindled by the taxi drivers and persecuted by old codgers flogging cameos , how can he know all that is just , so to speak , a show of civilities ?  --  the surface pleasantries of a reality which is infinitely worse , un/answerably better ? " He put his arm around me suddenly and squeezed me . " Why Jenny , " he said , seeing my eyes full of tears . " You old bubblyjock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Only pleasure . " " Call that nothing , do you ? " Justin let me go . " So there you are , there is something that moves you . Said he cannily . This place . " " Even that is muted . " " Places take more time than people . There is no real love at first s-i-t-e . " He spelt it . " Yet with people I do believe in it  --  instant attraction . " " So do I. " " We ca n't have our way so much with places . " What kept our odd acquaintance going , Justin 's and mine , was something more than the state of suspension that he claimed we shared . It mattered to us both to have some point of reference in that strange place , some means of attesting to the effect it had on us . We used each other as the army wives used the PX  --  not only as a convenient source of supply , but as a source of the totally and reliably familiar . Between our separations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we met it was as if to measure , against the supposedly fixed point of the other , the distance it had brought us ; to compare , without discussing them , our unwritten notes . I seldom spoke , for instance , to Gioconda of my brother and his wife . When I did mention them it wasp118usually to Justin . In the first place , Gioconda would have understood too quickly , instinctively , without absorbing the circumstances . An incestuous passion , consummated or otherwise , was an everyday affair at Naples , and she would never quite grasp what recognition of it in myself had meant to me . Whereas Justin saw it against the **27;11205;TOOLONG of post-war England and did not discount my distress , even for purposes , of giving comfort . Something else that inhibited me in talking of these matters with Gioconda was the scope and drama of her own tragedies . Whereas the excavations of Gioconda 's past brought to light temples , palaces and tombs , with ornate interiors worthy of grand gestures and heroic renunciations , my own archaeology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site  --  a hilltop encampmentof the Hittites , say , or some beehive village of the Picts  --  yielding nothing more than a heap of domesticutensils and a handful of weapons , few intact and none beautiful . Gioconda herself , however , could not bear any suggestion of drama in her past . It was one of the few things that discomposed her . " No , no , no , you ca n't conceive the dreariness of it , the indignity , the crushing daily items of an unhappy life , how endless time is when one wishes it past for no object , when one is continually afraid . I can hardly believe now that the war lasted only five years . One did n't know then how any of it might end , if it wouldp119ever end . Now it appears to have had a beginning and a conclusion , but we could not know then the form it would take , and assumed only the worst . . . And the physical hardship  --  hunger , cold , being dirty , the time wasted searching for food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of suffering , and the knowledge of the worse sufferingthat is unseen . " And she would spring up and walk about her room . Gioconda showed anger rarely . But the way in which she avoided certain subjects  --  government , religion , world events  --  and made light of other ones suggested the control of strong feeling rather than the absence of it ; even , that there was violence in her which she recognised and disciplined , and that whenever this got the better of her , as it occasionally did , she was ashamed . Once , when we drove to Rome in her little car , I remember that we crossed a narrow river-bed , mostly stones ; and I , seeing the sign on the bridge , cried out with the memory of the war , " The Volturno  --  but it 's such a little river ! " And Gioconda turned to me  --  turned on me , you might say  --  and almost shouted , " They were all little rivers , all of them , always . Ca n't you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apologetic laugh and glanced at me , and said , " Wait until you see the Rubicon . " But for the rest of the journey she was subdued and defensive , as if she had exposed herself and regretted it . She gave , in talking , a number of these clues to pas/lions that , had she not contended with them , might have ruled her  --  as when she had described herself writing at her father 's deathbed , or when she said to me , " Italians are seldom harmless . " But I , having established my own idea of her , was unwilling to let her extend herself into complexities , and disregarded these promptings . " People resort to violence , " she said  --  to us , one eveningwhen Gianni had taken us to dinner , " not to relieve their feelings , but their thoughts . The demand for comprehensionbecomes too great , one would rather strike somebody than have to go on wondering about them . " I noted the transition from " people " to " one . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of striking Norah ; but then she was not a person one was required to wonder about . " In my youth , " said Gianni , " I did some amateur boxing . But I would never have made a real pugilatore . My guard was too high . I had conceived some idea  --  mistakenly , no doubt  --  of my good looks , and I tried to protect my face . Yes , my guard was rather high ; and that kept me from being really good . " " What I mean is , in anger . Or in some culmination of resentment . " On the other hand she could not be roused , as almost any Anglo-Saxon can be , to vocal indignation ; she sensed its falsity and would have no part of it . In the warm early spring of that year the garbage collectorsof Naples went on strike ; their wages had notp121been paid , due to a disappearance of departmental funds . Rubbish piled up on pavements that were coated with grit , drains were blocked , refuse blew back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon I spotted a great ginger rat with prominent teeth hanging about behind the Hotel Excelsior . " Una zoccola , " Gioconda said , when I described it . " That 's what they call a rat like that in Neapolitan . " " Well , it 's disgraceful . " " The word also means a prostitute  --  in fact , the sayinghere is that the last straw for a cat would be to lie in the arms of its mistress without realising that she was una zoccola . " Gioconda giggled . " The rat 's nest , that 's what Leopardi called Naples , La Topaia . " " It 's a scandal . " But these matters went too deep with her , she wouldnot be drawn into them casually and merely shrugged tosummarise twenty centuries of civic disillusionment . " What will happen ? " " Oh  --  they say the mayor will have to pay the garbage-menout of his own pocket , the old devil . He 's rich , , he owns a shipping line . Whoever took the money kept that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a state of affairs . " " The scogliere are full of them  --  those white rocks , you know , piled up along the shore . " " Full of what ? " " Of zoccole. "  |p122The  mayor , who was off in Sardinia , flew home and paid the garbage collectors from his private fortune ; and Naples was cleaned up in time to hold a series of huge official receptions , in full dress , for a congress of the International Chamber of Commerce . Conversely Gioconda would puzzle , unpredictably , over matters that I easily absorbed or dismissed . Once in a while she reverted to the manner of our meeting , as if it continued to exercise her . I had written to the young man from Ealing , and forgotten him . But every so often Gioconda would pay him tribute for bringing us together  --  saying " Think of it " or " How unlikely , " as if there were something there to he unravelled . She called him " the Pharmacist , " after an episode in a poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance meeting in a chemist 's shop . It was as though she dwelt on these freakish , unresolved influences of our existence , wondering if they were coincidental or supernatural . Gioconda , moreover , had substance and territory of her own , while I earned a weekly living and was without even those resources that continuity of place and persons might have given me . When she told me how her book had enabled her to pay off the accumulated taxes on her flat , the fact of having a flat to be taxed on , and access to such a solution , made her , for me , a person of means and set her at liberty . These aspects of independence engendered passivity in me . The conviction from which she expressed herselfp123was too pleasing  --  too reassuring  --  for me to challengeit : I took note of her affinities and opinions in a way I had done with no one else . When she said one day , in talking of my family , " They will recede , " I felt assured , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Even your brother . You will think less about him , not seeing him , seeing others . " " My love , " I primly answered her , " is not condi-tional . " She was standing on a chair , putting a book hack , and did not look down . " Love is the most conditional thing there is . A word , a tone of voice , a moment 's silence can change it irrevocably . I did n't mean your feeling for your brother would completely dissolve . But it will lose its prominence and become a more and more distant landmark . " When she spoke this way I felt more than simply the truth of what she said . It was all natural to me , just as the sounds of Italian had seemed natural when I first began to learn them , and I wished I might always have been with people who thought and spoke like this . It did not occur to me to remind her of the contradiction in her own case . And what of your love , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions and silencesthat might have changed it , and yet apparently immutable ?  |p125Gioconda  spent the month of April on Capri . At Easter I saw her there when , for the long weekend , I too crossed to the islands . She was thinner  --  or seemed so , in grey trousers and a crimson pullover . The collar of a white shirt rising round her throat made her look at once younger and more womanly . Gianni was coming down from Rome , reaching the island by the last boat on Good Friday . " Il vaporetto del cornuti , " Gioconda remarked of it , as we watched the boat approaching from Naples . " The boat of the cuckolds . That 's what they call it in summer when the rich take houses here  --  this last boat on Friday that brings the husbands over to join their wives for the weekend . " " With us it would be the other way round . In the summer it 's assumed the husbands have been having adventures all week in town . " " That too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on her way to the port to meet Gianni , and we were waiting for the funicular to take her down.  |p126She  was often nervous , now , when Gianni was coming ; once he was there she became calm , imperturbably so . " But that 's of course . It 's the other way round that 's significant , humiliating , frightful . " " I do n't see it , " I said ; and she laughed and flicked at me with her ticket , and said , " If you do n't see that , you do n't see , anything . " " Truly , it always seems to me , " I said , although I had not considered the matter before , " that women are rather more faithful than men wish them to be . " " You mean that a man will call a woman neurotic if she is faithful one moment beyond the time when he desires her love . When he himself has ceased to love . " I had not meant this , and wondered if she were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retains what matters to him  --  the initiative . " After Gioconda had gone down to the port , I sat at one of the cafes in the piazza , rejoicing in liberty as I had done that December afternoon outside the Hotel Royal . I dwelt with almost physical pleasure on the evening that lay ahead to spend as I wished , with no need to be up early next day to meet the Colonel at the car . As I was enjoying these thoughts , the Colonel came out of the post office in a sports jacket and sat down at my table . " Enjoying the Isle of Capri , I see . " He said it " Ca-pree , " as in the song . After a while he said , " You had better have dinner with me . " He had this way of expressinghimself in unfinished threats.  |p127I  submitted to everything , having , as I thought , no excuse for doing otherwise , and not at that time realising that my own preference was a justification . I went to dinner with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked at length , savagely  --  and stupidly , for it is stupidity that makes people cruel  --  about Naples , about Italians , about our colleagues , and about a wider state of human affairs that he identified as " this mess . " When he went into the kitchen of the restaurant to complain about his fish , I dropped into his white wine a small sleeping pill I had put in a box in my handbag to be sure of sleeping long on my holiday . And by the time the wild strawberries arrived the Colonel had begun to doze . Recounting my evening to Gianni and Gioconda in the piazza next day , I spotted the Colonel blearily reading his newspaper . ( He could not know the whole cause of our laughter , but must have sensed the trend , for the following week he kept me late at work each evening for no purpose . He never came to Capri again , so far as I know , and often spoke of it as being full of degenerates . ) I noticed too that Gianni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a roar of delight at my story , became quieter at the sight of Gioconda with her hand to her mouth and tears of laughter brimming over her eyelids . It made him uneasy , not only the revelation of female duplicity , but her pleasure in it . Weeks later , when the Colonel cropped up in some other connection , Gianni went so far as to say that he felt " sorry for that man , with all you women baiting him . "  |p128Gianni  had hired a small boat in which he proposed to row us to an inlet , away from the holiday crowd . That morning on Capri we bought a picnic in the sooks of the town , and I got a bathing suit , not having known it would be warm enough to swim . Straddling a chair in a white shop that hotly smelt of the next-door bakery , Gianni pointed out the costume that would suit me best and , to punish me for having got the better of the Colonel , made a scene when I almost chose another . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . Stop sulking . You got the one that 'll look best on you . " " That 's beside the point , " I said , enraged by the uproarhe had made . Gianni stared . " It 's the only point , " he said . Taking us to the beach to claim the boat , he imagined himself , so it seemed , in possession of every lovely woman we passed . " Legs like that  --  my God " or " I 've always fancied women with that curly , carrotty hair "  --  in each case his admiration was unrelated to , undiminishedby , those that had gone before or would immediatelycome after . It was something of the same spontaneousand faithless pleasure with which Gioconda herselfwould remark of almost any flower that she saw  --  iris or freesias , roses or ranunculus , wild or growing in a pot or gathered in sheaves on a barrow  --  " That 's my favourite flower . " Gianni took credit for the island , as he had done with Herculaneum  --  for the Judas trees in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luridlyp139streaked between slopes of oak and juniper . Foreign tourists were doing their best to ruin it  --  " When I knew it first there was one car on Capri , one only , and it belonged to Ferrari . " He told me that Capri had been taken by the English ( luring the Napoleonic wars , though not for long , thank God  --  " Otherwise , can you imagine ?  --  another little Malta . " Gioconda and I floated in the boat while Gianni swam beneath us , monstrous in a rubber mask . " That great rock in the sea , the one all by itself . On that the Romans built a funeral pyre for a follower of Augustus Caesar . " Gioconda pointed , and I shaded my eyes to look . " The Monacone , they call it , because a monk lived there in the time of Tiberius . " " A monk , in the time of Tiberius ? " " I mean a priest , a sacerdote  --  whatever they had then . So they say , anyway . Gianni and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a hole through the middle of it , like a chimney . You can squeeze up , planting your feet on the sides . " " It sounds awful . " " So it was . The whole thing was somewhat awful  --  there was no place to land there from the boat , only a jagged shelf covered with sea-urchins . Then this vertical tunnel , wet , black , maggotty . . . On top , though , it was nice  --  like a big rough tabletop , covered with stunted bushes and flat , circular nests of sea-birds . But going upp130was horrible . I thought I was going to fall back through the rock and be killed . " " Why ever did you do it ? " I asked her , knowing well enough . " Oh  --  to be companionable , you know . I 'm unathletic , in general , for a person like Gianni . " I could imagine it all  --  the abuse , the remonstrances , Gianni shouting , " Su , su , idiota  --  not like that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At that momentGianni surfaced alongside . Holding on to the boat with one hand he blew out his snorkel and shook the water from his goggles . " What a pair  --  lolling here while there 's all this to be seen below . It 's marvellous down there . I do n't know what 's the matter with you . " Gioconda leant over , took the goggles from him and dried them on a towel . Gianni floated on his back beside the boat . " See that rock , Jenny  --  I got Gioconda to the top of that one day . What a job . It 's marvellous up there . Beautiful , is n't it , Gioconda ? " She agreed . " All kinds of plants , flowers , coloured lizards . Like a desert island . If it had n't been for me she would never have been up there . " We had our lunch among the rocks , on an arrow of sand that , once the boat was beached there , scarcelyp131allowed us to stretch ourselves in its shadow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cones of fruit and cheese . When we had eaten he lay down in the sun beside Gioconda ; but , with his hand shading his eyes , watched me while I sat up recorking bottles and pushing garbage into a bag . " Jenny , " he said . " You really do have a cat 's eyes . Amber , are they ? Or topaz ? " I told him , " My sister-in-law says they 're yellow . " He nodded . " That 's the sort of remark I get about my Maserati . Envy makes people desperate . " He yawned . " These flies . That 's the trouble about being on holiday , you can never rest . You never really take your afternoon snap , as the English call it . " I looked at Gioconda , who lay with eyes closed , as wakeful as he . Sand had dried on her arms and legs , and gilt was whitely grained into her brows and lashes . Years later at the Piraeus I saw an Athena , one of two great la @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excavations of a drain , lying flat on a stone floor with clay-caked eyes , bringing to my mind Gioconda as she lay motionlessnear the Saracen Beach that afternoon . While I watched she opened her eyes . Turning on her side towards Gianni and raising herself on one elbow , she laid her other hand almost tentatively on his midriff . " My God , " she said , " you 're roasting . You 'll be developingthe bronze disease . " He had been so petulant , so unpredictable , that day ,  |p132with  each of us , that I should not have been surprised to see him brush her hand away ; and was almost embarrassedwhen instead he tenderly covered it with his own . " I 'm told that goes away with handling , " he said . Gioconda 's hair , which floated around her when she swam , falling like a stain over her shoulders or drifting about her like some fringed sea-plant , was bound now to one side in a single thick cable . " Quite a dish , " a youth had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Which one ? " asked his friend . " The Long Plait , " the boy replied . " La lunga treccia , " I echoed now , as Gianni reached up and ran the heavy damp pigtail through his hand . " It 's what used to be called tresses . " " Yes , " said Gianni . " The sort of hair people could cherish locks of . " I told them how , on one of my sister-in-law 's excursionsto the inner circle , I had gone to John Murray 's in London and been shown the locks of hair clipped by Byron from his loves . " On one he had put Whose it is I do not recollect . But it is of 1812 . ' Then there was one  --  identified by Byron as something like Lisbon , 8  --  10 P.M. , October 17th '  --  incredibly long , coarse , straight , almost like a horse 's tail . " " How Byronic , " said Gioconda , " in the truest sense , if he had clipped a horse 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a souvenir of the Romantic era . Gianni said , " I can think of a still more Byronic explanation , but decency forbids . " With his free hand he killed a sandfly that had settled on his stomach , and remarked , " Un salaud de moms . Byron , " he went on , rubbing his palm in the sand to clean it , " Now there 's a great man . You know , he wrote to his friend , My mother-inlawhas been dangerously ill , and now is dangerously well again . ' " He passed the heavy braid of Gioconda 's hair through his hand again , allowing her enough rope . She leant away from him , laughing , letting him hold the taut pigtail by its tip . " I 'm at the end of my tether , " she said . One wet morning at the beginning of May , Germani , our driver , made known to the Colonel and me a Neapolitansaying  --  " Rain on the fourth of May , rain for four weeks . " As this cheerless maxim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distract our attention from some near miss to a barrow or a bicycle , proceeded to fulfill itself to the letter , the Colonel 's daily greeting to me was transformed from his unintelligible rendering of " Buon giorno " into " Sunny Naples . " And there he would stand , day in , day out , in a dripping doorway on Via Posillipo , saying " Sunny Naples " to himself and me and never tiring of it  --  so relieved was he to be confirmedin his suspicion that the fame of Naples wasp134groundless and that he need not trouble himself over its origins . Through the words one could retrace his military past , picturing the successive theatres of service in which he had snorted " Sunny Spain , " or " Sunny Egypt , " or " Sunny Palestine , " as the spring rains poured down on him in absolution . In the third week of that month , as we stood , the Colonel and I , looking over a rucked and slatey sea to the blurred cone , rising on its buff-coloured pediment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation of his when Justin Tulloch 's car drew up beside me , followed by the Vehicle . " Just in time , " I told him , climbing in . " That 's what they called me at school . " " What ? " " Justin Time . " " That man sends me up the wall . " " They called my brother Ethelred the Unready . " " Is his name Ethelred ? Really ? " " No . It was just to make a pair of us . Symmetry is not constructed out of logic . Come for a drive . " " You know I ca n't . I 'm late already . " " He 's later than you are , " said Justin , swerving out and passing the Vehicle . Just as it had been easy to imagine him a Scottish Nationalist , so too I could picture him with the hectic cheeks and plunging walk of the British schoolboy . " Now Jenny , " Justin said to me . " Know this . I grow to be quite fond of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee . " Do n't grow to be anything of the kind . " " Listen , " he said , copying the gesture but leaving his hand on my knee . " As yet I ask nothing . " He went on at once , " On our left , the tomb of Virgil . " The car slowed down to merge with the morning traffic of the tunnel that led out of Naples . " Fittingly placed at the gates of Bagnoli . " He said , " Good old Virgil . I salute thee , Mantovano . " Removing his hand from me he raised it before him , to the great interest of a young man who drew alongside us in a dented Topolino . " About my middle name , now  --  Jenny , why do you never show any curiosity about my middle name ? " " Well , what is it for heaven 's sake ? " " That P  --  for whose meaning affection would have prompted you to enquire long ere this  --  that P , my dear , stands for Pericles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . as the saying goes , no bounds . " " It 's nice . I hope you 're not joking . " " I 'm not joking . I like it myself . " " I knew someone at Cape Town whose middle name was Vercingetorix , for the same reason . " " I 'm jealous of him already . " " Do n't be . He 's twelve . " This sort of talk could continue through the tunnel and out the other side , past blocks of fascist sport pavilionsand dopoguerra housing , until Justin left me at my office . " Yabbling away , " Justin himself used to call it . I suppose we both knew that something would come of itp136eventually  --  felt that it was up to circumstances , having brought us together in the first place , to draw conclusions from so much banter . My own detachment , so far as it was pleasantly conscious , continued to interest me ; Justin 's , of course , was merely exasperating . Some time before this I began to have weekends to myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunchtime on Saturday and need not return to it until Monday morning . I made short , rainy trips  --  down to Paestum , over to the islands , up to Rome . In Rome that May the weather was better . Mostly I went up by train , but Gioconda several times drove to Rome to visit Gianni , and once or twice took me along in her car  --  a tearing , hooting journey among fields yellow with mustard and trees damp with rising sap ; among the little clouds of the olives , and the lyre-shaped ranks of budding vines . They were a relief , those trips to Rome . In the south the rain had begun to dilute our spirits . Even my sister-inlawhad read of it in The Times , and wrote , " What a shame you are having such frightful weather . " In Naples we had given up looking for wedges of clear sky or diagnosing signs of change . At Bagnoli we dodged from building to building tenting our heads with raincoats , and on one of the cameo-hunting expeditions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at a shop that called itself the Fountain of Rubber . At first merely a symptom of the sirocco , the rain was now being attributed to the atomic bomb , as if so maddening a phe/nomenon must of necessity be man-made . In the middle of May the British obligingly detonated a hydrogen bomb in the Pacific , and this  --  though coming after weeks of rain  --  was taken as proof by the faction that supported the theory of the bomba atomica . " For all I know , " I said to Gianni , " they may be right . " Gianni looked pained , and raised his palm at me like a traffic policeman . " Figlia mia . At the end of the First World War , when I was a boy , there was a lot of bad weather in Europe . And why was that ? It was the guns on the Western Front , they said ; it was the disturbance in the atmosphere caused by poison gas ; it was  --  I forget what other fantasies . Then there was the rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bombardment too , as I recall . Now it 's the atomic bomb , is it ? Let us congratulate ourselves , my dear . It may be that the least we have to fear from shelling , gas , or the atomic bomb is a shower of ruin . Rome was a relief , most of all , from poverty . As Gioconda had said , the collective indigence of Naples bore down sometimes in a begrimed and desperate sadnessthat all the city 's compensations could not outweigh . Rome , poor as it was  --  poorer then than now  --  could never crush you with its poverty as Naples did ; alleviatedby well-groomed , floodlit monuments , by tourism , by a middle class , and by the opulence of church and mate , it could never convey the same sense of unremittingp138daily hardship . I loved , then , these excursions into the comparative well-being of the Romans  --  the evidence of comfort or of luxury glimpsed through the windows of apartments and displayed in the velvet vitrines of dress shops or art dealers or jewellers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beggars ; it was a pleasure to sit outdoors at a cafe without watching the envelope of sugar disappear from my saucer into the lightning grasp of a ragged infant . ( The few outdoor cafes of Naples likely to provide such refinementsas separate , sealed sugars were haunted by these swift children in the way that , at Rome , the restaurantswere patrolled by cats . ) After the impoverished provinciality with which , at Naples , individual sophisticationwas invariably countered , Rome  --  though with its own , less vital brand of provincialism  --  seemed grandly cosmopolitan to me . One Sunday morning I sat having coffee beside one of the kiosks in the Borghese Gardens and , in this mood of relief , watched  --  as if I could never get enough of it  --  husbands and wives and children , fresh from Mass , washed , starched , and ironed , in white shirts and pink dresses and hats heavy with flowers ; accompanied by well-fed babies in high-sprung prams and little silky dogs on red leather leashes . So many of these comfortable , comforting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else in Rome  --  nothing more distressing , nothing more interesting.  |p139Gianni  's apartment was at the top of an old house near Piazza del Popolo , with a long , tawny view of Rome . It was a beautiful and , to me , disturbing place . The rooms were white , and plate glass had been let into some of the deep walls . There were teak tables in front of long sofas , and leather chairs beside Swedish telephones ; a high fidelity system was concealed in the bar . Along with this went a pair of eighteenth-century tables in scagliola and a French mirror almost as high as the high room where it hung . There were walls of books , and paintings by Morandiand Derain . In a recess between two windows there was an Attic vase on which Hector and Menelaus contendedfor the body of Patroclus . In Gianni 's bedroom there was a great picture : a landscape seen through tears of joy . I had never seen such things in a private house until then ( for my expeditions with Norah had broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and was ranch moved by them . Gianni , curiously enough , took less credit for my pleasure than he had done at Capri or I Herculaneum , quite modestly asking , " You really like it then ? " or saying , " You know he painted several versions of this . " There was a study , other bedrooms  --  I do n't think I ever saw all the rooms in Gianni 's flat . When I said this to him he answered , " In Italy one should try to have some rooms one does n't have to enter . Like undeveloped aspects of one 's personality . "  |p140I  never saw a sign of children , not even a photograph . But once on Gianni 's crowded desk I saw stamps , torn off and put aside in a pile , as if for a child . The beauty of this flat of Gianni 's was the most troublingof his inconsistencies . It reflected not only an unfeignabledegree of intellect and feeling , but even  --  for its main impression was of clear surfaces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : qualities that one must exclude from Gianni 's compositionin order to make his daily self comprehensible . Unlikethe abrupt suggestions of discord in Gioconda , **25;11234;TOOLONG were disturbing in an expansive , favourable sense  --  like the wide , modern light that came into his rooms from the window-surgery he had performed on that ancient building . I liked him better on this home ground of his  --  he was kinder and less dictatorial there ; and , with Gioconda , even loving . Just then it was as though he could not let her out of his sight . If she went on to his terrace or disappeared into another room ( and she wandered about that place pullingout books and touching plants like a nosy child that seeks , in strange surroundings , the sources of home ) , he would shout her name ; and at once she would call back to him , " So ' qua , " or appear in a doorway , " Eccomi . " I remember that they had asked me to lunch one Sunday  --  it was that Sunday of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room to fetch somethingp141from her coat or her handbag . Gianni suddenly got up from the table and went after her ; and in that long mirror that went from floor to ceiling I saw him take her in his arms without a word . The apartment was open for business at all hours . Even on Sundays the phones were ringing and people were let in and out carrying briefcases and big flat portfolios . Gianni had a secretary , a soft , quiet , humorous man called Bindi who wore glasses ( he had a chronic eye infection ) and was prematurely bald . Bindi 's pinkrimmed , unshockable appraisal missed nothing . Since he was always present , always overworked , I assumed he lived in the building ; but later found out that he had a wife and many children and an apartment of his own quite far away , near Piazza Bologna . It was hard to see how he had contrived to create these ulterior circumstances . At night there were always friends who dropped in  --  screenwriters , actors , businessmen , foreigners who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These women of the fi I m world were fascinating to me . I was hypnotised by their lifted hair ( hair then was beginning to be teased , though not yet into those conical towers that were to be erected the following year ) , or curled sideburns sleekly Battened to the cheek , their marvellously pencilled eyelads , and silvered lame breasts deflecting , like so many armoured plastrons , any remark not exclusively concerned with themselves . There were other women , too ,  |p142brought  by men and no less notable in their capacity for total preoccupation with a new scarf or bracelet , and in their total incuriosity regarding the world  --  or even the room  --  around them . Their white-blonde or blue-black heads carried high , never inclining to any expressive attitude , they reminded me  --  as they stood about on Gianni 's terrace or his Persian rug  --  of those columns that support the mosque at Cordoba , each with its diversifiedcapital , serving extravagantly to show how many varieties of a single object can be put to a common purpose . Coming from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even married couples  --  or , rather , especially married couples  --  affected to ignore their sexual connection , or to treat it as something apart and almost irrelevant to their shared life , I liked to see the forthrightly sexual pairing of woman with man . On the other hand , it struck one that the women were required only to be vain , and the men to be proud , any attributes beyond these being unlooked-for , and not always welcome . Their talk was like their appearance  --  well expressed and without intellect . " What did you expect ? " said Gioconda , when I remarked on this . " Italians do n't say interesting things  --  everyone knows that . You 're not in Paris , after all . " This circle of Gianni 's exasperated her . In one way , though , their talk affected me with homesickness , for I envied the intimacies of language andp143upbringing , all the puns and jokes and local allusions t h a t even such a gathering as this could generate  --  and in which I could never truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These regional code-words should come forth naturally or not at all , if one is not to sound over-accommodating in one 's own ears . The Americanin England who treats himself to an occasional broad A and talks about draught Bass , the Englishman who in Paris takes up gallic mispronunciations of Englishwords , abjectly relinquishes his identity without gainingan authentic substitute ; thus in Naples I could not speak of Via Roma by the old name  --  Via Toledo  --  by which I had never known it , though to everyone else it might be the " Tuleto . " It was of course the very game of language that with I ustin I resisted  --  because in his case I felt that it was being played against me . Of Gianni 's colleagues , or collaborators , or rivals , whom I met there - men whose names , like his own , were associated with the post-war films , I could rarely get him to say a good word : their work was " sciocchezze " or " cafonaggine " ; this one had run out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an imbecile . " But Gianni , he seems a literate man , at least . " " As long as you do n't talk to him about literature . " Or " Nothing special , " he would declare . " As the English say , very run of the mile . " Gioconda took me to see her own friends in Rome  --  ap144young antiquarian , an ancient physicist , a prolific novelist , and a journalist who almost succeeded in shaming , on one or two occasions , the Government of Italy with his pitilessly documented revelations . I remember how we went , she and I , to faceless modern buildings near Piazza Vescovio or off Via Salaria and squeezed ourselvesinto tiny lifts that ascended , shuddering , to these shrines where the high priestess  --  wife , mistress , or mother , always beautiful , always anxious  --  would usher us down the dim corridor to the darkened sanctum murmuring her warning , " X is a a bad mood today " or " You will find Y a little distraught " ( these women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last name ) . X or Y , sunk in gloom , immobile as the Buddha , sometimes suffering the intrusion with barely a greeting , would receive our opening remarks with an expression of excruciating ennui . The first morose , monosyllabic responses , like the heavy , separate drops preceding a great storm , would be followed at length by the inundation  --  castigation of the government , of the church , of modern art , modern literature , modern Italy : " Italians hate beautiful things  --  look how they are destroying Rome , " X or Y would thunder , gripping the arm of his ugly modern chair or pounding his plywood table . Or " They worry about the bandits in Sicily , but the real bandits are in Rome , sitting in Parliament . " " As to the Front Populaire . . . " With outmodedexpressions they expounded dated causes  --  orp145was it we who were more and more successively dated , passing from one timely issue to the next , while they had remained constant , unfashionably , untopically altruistic ? The ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passions not yet turned to slogans , of gifts not deployed for gain , of goodwill not turned to selfimportance . Artists , then , had not yet begun to talk of their influence , nor journalists of their artistry . When he spoke , X or Y , wistfully of New York or Paris or London , as places where one could be free of cliques and jealousy and parochialism , one could only feel protective towards this moving belief in the existence , on the earth , of some wider and loftier society in which human nature was represented only by its virtues . Of them Gioconda said to me , " They do n't have to justify themselves , and that gives them less to talk about than other people . In the war we all had to choose , there are no hypothetical positions left to be taken . In this country , everything has been demonstrated . That 's why the talk is often about trivialities  --  who has the malocchio , who is stingy , who is homosexual ; whereas in other countries people can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never be called on to live up to them by sacrificing their means , or their standing , or their children , or their lives . These friends of mine are rather disliked for having done the right thing . And for choosing obscurity afterwards . " Another time she told me , " I think that 's why filmsp146were such a big thing in Italy after the war . It was somethingfresh , untainted  --  an art whose practitioners had n't as yet disgraced themselves . " All these friends of Gioconda 's were men . And watching them lean forward to talk to her , to bend over her hand as she arrived , or embrace her on her departure , I would think any one of them more eligible than Gianni to be her lover.  |p147JUNE  CAME , and there was no more rain . Gianni was making a film at Tripoli  --  " One of those films , you know , " Gioconda told me , " that take place in Siberia but are filmed in Africa . " He was to be there some weeks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it got too hot . He wrote that there was a plane to Tripoli from Naples once a week . " Why should Gianni want to make a film like that ? " On some days I was more unkind to her about Gianni than on others . " I suppose he wants to get rich , " she said , as if it had no more meaning than if she 'd said , " For his health " or " For a joke . " Gianni , apparently , had not chosen obscurity . She went on about the journey : " It would only be for ten days or so . " We were sitting in the sun at a cafe on the seafront of Naples , and it was the first fine weekend of that summer . She put Gianni 's letter away in her handbag . I could see she wanted to go.  | " Of course you ought to go , " I urged her , giving the right response . " It 'll be fascinating . " " What will be fascinating ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled . " One does n't leave Italy to see Roman ruins . Then there 's all that crowd  --  " She disliked the prospect of appearing there as Gianni 's mistress . Still she wanted to go . " I 'll have to have a dress made . " She and I had coffee together again , on the day of her departure . I was bringing some documents to the airfield that noon , and we arranged to coincide . Arriving hot and nervous in a taxi , Gioconda joined me in the civil airport , at a little bar that no longer exists , and we waited for her flight to be called . She put perfume on a handkerchief and touched her ears with it , the scent at once evaporating into the smell of espresso and of the solution used to wash the terrazzo floors . She was more agitated than I had seen her . She had been delayed at the hairdresser  --  her too rigidly dressed hair was strained back and lacquered ; her brow was pink and shiny from the electric dryer . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite matronly in its self-effacement , its good sense . It hurt me to see this suit with its instinctive repudiation of her position ( a wife , I suppose , might have decked herselfout like a courtesan for such a reunion ) . A gesture of pressing her forehead , then tucking the handkerchief into her sleeve was prim , even spinsterish . I was moved , too , to see her excited as a child  --  butp149no , for there is no childhood excitement to equal the adult journey to the beloved . She held out her hands to me over the coffee cups . " My nails . There was no time to have my nails done . " I see her , upright in that pale linen suit , holding her hands out over the stained table . " It will be the first thing he 'll notice . " " Then he wo n't be very observant . " Childishly , I could not bring myself to send love to Gianni . " I 'll send you a card , Jenny . Of the Roman ruins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I felt anxiety  --  that the plane might crash , that something else might go wrong . I felt as if I were being let down : nothing connected with Gioconda had ever seemed inauspiciousuntil this . For the instant of our farewell , the roles were reversed and I was playing her protector . I watched her pass through a railed enclosure banked by eucalyptus , and across a field of glittering concrete to the plane . Her thoughts already on Gianni , she did not look back and wave . That day was the beginning of a heat wave that lasted till Gioconda 's return . The days were hot at dawn . My bed faced double doors that gave on to the terrace , and I would be wakened at five by rails of scalding light that spilt through the shutters . When I looked out the sea would be still as a lake , the sky blindingly red , and the volcano against it black and enormous . Serafina , arrivingp150from a sleepless night , had always the same cynical gesture of supplication , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morire . Un caldo da morire . " Combinations of colour flared out , in spontaneous combustion , like fires all along the Posillipo  --  plumbagoand oleander , bougainvillea heaped on vermilion walls : the sun made everything possible . Germani had flowered too , as at a signal , into large , shockingly white shoes that came above his ankle . In the car he kept a tube of cleaner with which , at stop lights , he was forever furtivelychalking off small blemishes from these feet of clay . The Colonel , who had given up " Sunny Naples " just when it would have meant most , was revelling in his new disenchantment : he had been in the tropics , in the desert , in the jungle , so it turned out , without ever experiencing worse heat than this . " But there , " he would say as we stood in the shade of the portone , or perspired in our boiling car , " there life was arranged for it , they knew how to handle it . Here they have n't a clue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Naples framed some pale woman or trio of exhausted children leaning out for air . The waterfront , the park below the palace , every street in the city was a refuge from rooms that heated throughout the long day ; and the population of Naples walked about all night , unsurprised , as if of all their afflictions this was the one they were most prepared for . Small boys with over-large , over-knowledgeable Nea/politan heads trotted up Via Chiaia on bare feet , wearing wet bathing slips and carrying here a fishing rod improvisedfrom a curtain rail , or there a float consisting of a patched inner tube . A week after Gioconda 's departure a postcard came from Tripoli  --  the arch of Marcus Aurelius in pink and yellow , with a chartreuse minaret in the background . " Roman ruins , just as you said , " Gioconda wrote , and concluded , " So here we are  --  en fin . " " Killing heat , " Gianni had added . " Un caldo da morire . Be glad you 're in Italy where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " en fin . " A second card  --  Sciara Adrian Pelt from the Castle  --  showed a flat and windy shore , office buildings , and a corniche lined with palms . " Back no later than the 18th , " and Gioconda had signed herself " tua Gioconda . " Underneathwas scrawled , " Bacetti  --  tuo Giannino . " Gioconda came to see me one evening , a week or so after her return . I was just back from work when she arrived and was changing my dress . On the way home I had bought a carton of milk at the PX . For hygienic reasons this milk was brought down from a NATO installationin West Germany , where its waxed container had never entertained the possibilities of Neapolitan high mummer : in the heat of the taxi the container melted entirelyaway , leaving the floor of the car awash with purified milk . I consoled the stupefied driver with bank/notes and squelched into my flat a few minutes before Gioconda came to the door . She was deeply sunburnt , to a high colour that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an immaculate white dress , a dress that no one would launderfor themselves . Because of the milk I had come to the door in bare feet , and she seemed to me statelier and taller than before . She laid down on my hall table a wide hat of stitched blue linen she had carried in her hand . She stretched out on a long chair on my terrace , saying little , turning her head against the cushions to look at the bay , languidly , like a convalescent . Crowds of children were swimming off the rocks along the Posillipo , or from packed rowing-boats , shrieking at one another in summer ecstasy ; every evening they shrieked there as long as the light lasted . Turning on their backs , kicking frantically , they sometimes looked up to us and waved , and she waved back or called out " Ciao , " while I set out a jug and glasses on a table between us . She leant forward to slap at an insect on her bare leg . Along her shoulders , above the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flecks . The imperfection was a relief , making her beauty human , vulnerable . " When it gets dark , I 've got a candle that keeps the insects away . A chemical thing . " " What a good idea . Where did you get it ? " " At the PX . " I told her the story of the milk . She laughed , and her own laughter seemed to enlivenp153her . She looked at the city and at the sea . " What a good place to be . " " And Tripoli ? " I asked her . She spread her hands . I filled our glasses . " Do you wish you had n't gone ? " " If I had n't gone , I would have had to wonder whether I ought to have gone . Something else would have happened  --  gone wrong  --  and I would have wondered if it was my fault for not going . . . The thing is  --  one should n't have to wonder this much about everything . " She took her cold tumbler in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ah Jenny , I beg your pardon . I am always telling you my sagas . " " Tell me the Tripoli saga , if you like . " " It was awful . Ciao , ciao , divertiti ! " She lifted her hand to the shriekers and splashers . " Awful . Oh God , do you remember when we said goodbye at the airport and I was going on about my fingernails ? Well , that 's how it began . " To my surprise she began to laugh again , shaking her head . " Disastrous . That plane stopped at Malta , supposedly for an hour , and I went off to look for a place  --  a hairdresser 's or something  --  in the airport there that would do those bloody nails of mine for me . There was n't one  --  or if there was I never discovered it . But in the meantime they must have called the flight early , and it took off without me . " " Oh no . " My hand went to my mouth in her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had gone  --  Oh Jenny , I tell you . It seemed so much worse at the time too . Is n't it exactly the kind of nitwitted thing that women get the name of doing ?  --  I was furious with Gianni for terrorisingme about things like fingernails and for turning me into the sort of person , to whom this could happen . Well , it was n't so bad  --  fortunately there was another plane to Tripoli within the hour , by mere chance . It was a private affair , chartered for some congress of economists , but I flung myself on their mercy and very kindly they took me with them . " I imagined the delight of the kind economists . It was the sort of thing only an innocent might have done , someone who had not taken the sacrament of officialdom . " So I got to Tripoli , and there was Gianni at the airport . By then the other plane had come in without me , and he was raising hell with the airline . . . He was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another , just stood and shouted questions . When he heard what had happened  --  you can imagine . " At this " you can imagine , " with its first reference to my own idea of Gianni , its first suggestion of complicity , I felt the compunction one feels when one has ultimately converted  --  corrupted  --  another to one 's point of view at the expense of some deep conviction of their own . With this phrase Gioconda acknowledged not only my reservationsabout Gianni , but their validity as well : there was no gratification in getting my own way ; only , much graver , more crucial , the pang at her surrender.  | " I was this , I was that , it was the temperament of the Mezzogiorno , undisciplined thinking , no thinking at all . . . We drove to town in an open car , and people looked at us  --  you know , Gianni shaking his fist into the air and roaring Paresse mentale ! Paresse mentale ! ' " We had both ceased to laugh . " After that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to being exasperated , and I to apologising . I could think only of boring things to say , I looked wrong , felt I had brought the wrong clothes  --  how infantile it sounds  --  the things we did turned out badly and I felt responsible , even for the heat . . . Everything I did seemed to be the last straw for Gianni . One day he said to me , You would understand me better if I spoke Chinese to you . ' I thought it would never end . " Turned from me in the dying light , her profile was regal , uplifted , oddly matched to what she was saying . But she suddenly looked round at me with eyes of grief . " Oh Jenny , " she said in a lower voice , " for the first time I had to wonder  --  I mean , to fear  --  what it might be like if I were to marry him . " She rested her head back on the cushion and closed her eyes to suppress tears . She added , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself a swift , punishing blow on the temple and said , " Mosquito . " Then " Maybe Gianni is right , " allowing him the last word . " I 'm becoming the sort of woman who misses aeroplanes , and recounts her grievances . " I lit the insect-repelling candle and put it on the table.  |p156Gioconda  lay with her arms by her sides , not opening her eyes , her body relapsed as an animal 's . Over the end of the wicker chaise-longue her sunburnt feet were extended in delicate blue sandals , the toenails painted pink . These well-tended feet looked  --  as she lay there in pain  --  pathetic , irrelevant , furbished for pleasures from which she had been drastically diverted ; as they might have looked had she been lying on a stretcher after an accident . Music came up to us from a cockle-shell strung with coloured lights and headed out to Marechiaro . The accordionistwas squashed in the stern among lovers , cousins , and aunties who rocked out and in with the rhythm of his arms in a form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As soon as the song was finished they sent up their shouts for others . " It is so good to be home , " Gioconda said . She sat up . " Let 's drive to Marechiaro and have dinner . If the car 's still there , that is , for I parked in a forbidden place  --  in conformity , I suppose , with the new role of female nit-wit . " While I was carrying the tray to the kitchen I heard her come inside . When I returned I found her seated at the dressing-table fixing the tortoise-shell comb into the coil of her hair and singing the song that had come up to us from the boat  --  " Those who are right , Let 's admit they 're right ;  |p157As  for those who are wrong  --  Let 's admit they 're right too . . . " As I watched she rested her fingertips on the table 's edge and sat looking into the mirror . I saw in the poise of her head something I had not noticed before  --  that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that long-sufferingwomen do , so that you can practically see the blows that have been rained on them , to which they have not bowed , that they have disciplined themselves to withstand . This staunch , dedicated attitude saddened me the more for having about it the expectation and acceptance of future suffering . When she saw my reflection , however , she sprang up and came over , skating across the tiles like a child . " What a good floor for sliding on . It 's the glaze . It looks like a quilt . " It was true  --  the tiles were diamondshapedand slightly convex as if they had bubbled in the baking , and the effect was a lustrous , copper-coloured eiderdown . In a few places a tile had cracked , from something dropped or from the pressure of heavy furniture , giving more of a patchwork impression than ever . Gioconda laughed and , with her hand on the doorpost , skidded past me into the hallway , the air of mute stoicismnow unimaginable in her . She stood at the front door swinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my handbag and switched off a light or two . " Such a risk to say , What would I do without you , ' but I offer you thep158words all the same , Jenny . " When I opened the door she flapped her hat with a silencing motion at the thudding of drums that came down from the kraal of the nightclub on the hillside . " If , as Gianni says , only an unworthy friend tells troubles , then I am the most unworthy friend you ever had . " Again the incongruity of words and bearing  --  as she stepped out over my threshold lightly , proudly , proclaimingherself " l'amica pia indegna the to abbia mai avuto . " " I do nothing for you . I wish I could . " I slammed the door behind us . " Why a risk ? " " Why , the evil eye , my dear . It 's the sort of thing that gets said before . . . " As we went down into the dark tunnel , Gioconda made the gesture of exorcism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her white shape as it drew ahead of me along the corridor . " Does that exist for you ? " She tilted her head as if she were truly considering , and then we were in darkness until I pressed the next button . " You know what Croce said about it . " " Of course I do n't . " " That it does n't exist . And that it is a most terrible thing . " When Gianni came back from Tripoli , Gioconda gave a party . At her house from time to time I had met those friends of hers  --  the relative who lived near Sorrento , the plump twin sisters , and two or three couples , young/ish , quietish , who dropped in to leave a message or borrow a book . One could not say that her life was solitary ; yet it lacked any current of companionship , other than Gianni 's . Once , in talking to Justin about Gioconda , I spoke of this absence , in her life , of close attachments , blaming Gianni for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very associations that would have freed her from him . I said , " She should be meeting others . " " Granted , " said Justin , " that he 's the prize bounder of all time , just as you say  --  a howling cad . Still , consider a little the life here of such a woman , if she 's as you describe her . " Justin always put in phrases like " if she 's all you say " or " according to you , " to indicate to me that I was over-enthusiastic about Gioconda , the victim of a schoolgirl crush . " A city like this  --  that has never had a middle class till now , and now that they do exist the middle class are precisely the people who wish to preserve the myth of their own non-existence and perpetuate the gulf between rich and poor . Assuming she needs a lithe human society  --  this friend of yours is free to choose companions from bigots , fascists , provincials , reactionariesof all kinds : rich foreigners playing at living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mantelsheif in July the Christmas card signed Umberto . ' She can hearken indefinitelyto matrons on the subject of silverware and pelmets , and in the evenings she can go out to playp160bridge and hear the local scandal about someone who spoke in favour of divorce . . . If you and I are refugeesfrom the nit-picking and name-dropping of our native land , think what the comparable tuft-hunting circlesmust be round here . The fact is that life as a permanentfixture of a town like this can be a pretty lonely business . And you are the best thing that 's happened to La Gioconda in years . " Justin liked to be sceptical about Gioconda , and after a while I stopped talking to him about her , for I felt that my admiration generated antagonism in him . Now and then , when Justin and I discussed our war wounds , compared our respective theatres of service , I would think that he might have this bond , at least  --  the horrors of war  --  in common with Gioconda , and was tempted to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are got together at a regimental dinner . Ultimately , however , it had pleased me to know them separately . Yet it was odd that they had never met , not even by chance . Several times Gioconda asked me to bring Justin to dinner or to tea , or on some drive we were taking , but at first these invitations coincided with Justin'strips or appointments ; and later I did not even relay them to him , for I felt that he was prejudiced against her . In other matters , too , Justin made a habit of pitting reason against my enthusiasms , somewhat after the fashionof Serafina . Though he urged me to remain artless , he would invariably point out flaws in my spontaneousp161judgments ; it made him feel sound , judicious . I too wished to be governed by reason  --  to a reasonable extent  --  but not to be used as a foil for someone else 's rationality . One can not wish to be a sort of flint off which reasonable observations are struck like matches . " Of course you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me of the party she was giving , and I agreed of course I would . I did ask Justin if he would come , but he was flying to Rome that same day for the opening of an international conference on fisheries . " We 're fated , he and I , " said Gioconda , when I told her . But she went on , " Perhaps it 's for the best . You do n't want to give all your time to one . You should be meeting others . " Gioconda hung lanterns from the pergola at one end of her terrace , and at the other end she installed a group of musicians  --  two youths and a dark , lovely girl  --  whom she had hired for the evening . Inside , her study was almost untouched , but the salotto had been rearrangedto allow for a long table where the supper was served  --  " a lavish supper , " as I shamelessly described it to Norah in a letter , with so many dishes of rice and lobster and chicken , of shrimp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sweets : zuppa inglese in a white dish , tiny cakes sugared in green or pink ; and ices in the form of fruits delivered that afternoon by Caflisch in a tub of dry ice , each with its strong or delicate colouring , its bloom of frost that dissolved to a gloss as soon as the platter was set on the table . The women were all like that  --  like smooth , coolp162fruit  --  that evening . Dresses then were full-skirted and came below the knee , but the impression was all of lightly drawn forms and clear colours . I remember the shining hair , drawn back , or falling forward over summer-colouredskin , the slender shoulders and wrists , and slim brown legs ; and the cat crouching rodent-like under a sofa , fiercely watching . Of the men , all were personable , confident , in the way of Italian men ; each one interesting to himself . None was of Gianni 's age , though none was very young . Several couples  --  the majority perhaps  --  were married ; but the atmosphere was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came among us in a dress the colour of poppies , with a narrow crimson ribbon threading the coils of her hair . The summer night , the house , the antiquated music , all increased the untopicalitythat attended the events of Naples  --  the sense that this might be any year , any era , and that only the season was essential . One particular thing remains with me of that evening . Late , we went outside to dance . The terrace was cleared of its usual furniture , but along the sides a few low tables and rattan chairs had been set . The orchestra , which until then had played " airs "  --  the music of old songs , most of them Neapolitan  --  as a background to . our talking and eating , changed character . The beautiful girl with the guitar had been to Brazil , it turned out , and had brought back music to dance to ; and over Gioconda'sp163terrace the couples circled and parted , then drew together , sprang forward or retreated , with steps of such calculated vitality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times almost formal and part of some ritual long-determined , much rehearsed . What I particularly remember is this . Many of the women had taken off their sandals , kicking them away to the edge of the terrace , and were dancing on bare brown feet  --  this and the savage reverberations of the music contrasting violently with the smooth lips and elegant dresses , arched eyebrows and immaculate hair . As we danced , a glass was swept from one of the little tables , by the swirl of a skirt or a shawl , and smashed on the tiles , the fragments going everywhere , indistinguishable from the coloured tessellations . No one stopped . No one even looked down . The dancers spun back and forth under the lanterns and the bare feet went flying in and out among the spikes of glass . It was only when the musicians paused that Tosca came out with a brush and swept the pieces away . I do n't think that anyone was hurt ; yet the incident , with its sensation , though unexperienced , of glass biting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ; and the memory is tinged with horror.  |p165ONE  LAST TIME we met by chance , Justin and I , on a hot Saturday afternoon of July , when I was on my way up Via Duomo . Justin was coming down , on foot , but he turned back to walk with me . And I was going to see Gioconda . " I 've been in a museum . This place here . " He took my arm , but released it because of the heat . " Armaments and porcelain , the bull-and-china shop . Dreary , as a matter of fact  --  everything good was lost in the war or has gone somewhere else . Even the palazzo is a reconstruction . " In passing he thumped his fist on the cliff of rusticated stone , as if to expose its essential flimsiness . We strolled up the hot street , he in no hurry because he was at a loose end , morose , and glad to have run into me ; I hanging back because I was undecided whether or not to take him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ter little shop of wedding dresses , the mannequins with their over-optimistic post-war faces and their bodies tautly glazed in cheap satin , stiffly winged with tulle ,  |p166attended  by trappings for bridesmaids , mountainous hats for mothers-in-law . Justin was enchanted with the windows . " This is a plot . You lured me here . " He began to sing  --  " Why am I always the bridesmaid , Never the blushing bride ? Ding , dong , wedding bells Only ring for other girls  --  " getting approval from the passers-by . " Jenny me dear , " he said , " let 's buy you an outfit and marry you off . But to whom ? " " Look , " I said . " Always ordering me to look or listen . Influence of the Italian language  --  Guarda , " Senti '  --  assuming you 'd address me familiarly , which is doubtful . " " Look . Listen . Come with me . I 'm turning in here , at San Biagio . " " Oh . Your friend . " He looked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all like a photograph by Man Ray . " Now that he hesitated , I pressed him . " Come on . " " All right , " he said , and we entered San Biagio dei Librai . " But I preferred her as a legend . " It went as badly as it was bound to do . I was too anxious that they should get on with one another , Ip167wanted them to show to advantage for my sake . But Gioconda was having one of her untidy days , with her hair straggling down uncombed ; she was wearing an unbecomingstriped dress , and sandals with broken straps . She lit cigarette after cigarette , narrowing her eyes against the smoke in a fiendish grimace I had never seen before . Justin was colourless , incurious , monosyllabic  --  the very picture of scepticism fully confirmed . I wanted to prompt them , to say to her , " Go on , be beautiful , be original , as I described you , " or to him , " Be witty , be charming , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked so decrepit to me , and as Justin 's eyes passed over threadbare rugs and cushions , and rested on the water-colour of Procida in 1902 , everythingtemporarily lost colour and character , even Gaetano'smarguerites . When at last we came out of the palazzo and set off in the direction of the Gesu Nuovo , the street itself seemed excruciatingly squalid , and nothing more . " Oh my God , " said Justin , glancing into a soiled courtyard . I told him , " It 's not all neglect . Some of it 's the war , still . The bombardment . " He smiled . " Naples always looks as if it had just been under bombardment . " We walked on , not speaking , just as on the winter evening when we had gone together to San Gregorio Armeno ; and I thought how little these passing monthsp168had added to our intimacy . It was as if we had known each other since childhood and had nothing left to disclose . Carried along in the early evening crowd , or pushing our way against it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church of Sant'Angelo a Nilo , where there was , opposite the monument to the Alexandrians , a stand that sold cool drinks . The stand , like a thousand others in Naples , was decorated with swags of immense lemons and oranges , and with the tapering fronds of their leaves . On its counter , crescents of coconut floated in bowls of water , and around its base stood classical amphorae of terra cotta , some of them unmarked , some of them inscribed with serpentine designs in red or black  --  amphorae that in the past carried miraculous , iron-bearing " acqua f errata , " and now hold mere water for the drinks pressed from the overhanging fruit . " Jenny . " Justin took my hand and led me across in front of a fast car . " Have some lemonade . " We leant on the counter . " Why all these amphorae , I wonder ? Why not a tank of some kind ? " He asked the plump girl who was squeezing the lemons , and she told him , There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool . She said , " We call them e'mmummarelle . ' " " Think of that , " said Justin to me . " Reflect a little , Jenny , on the origins of such a word . " The girl was rosy , dressed in pink  --  immaculate , she appeared to me , after slatternly Gioconda  --  and her arm , as it rose lightly up and moved powerfully down top169crush the fruit on the small machine she used , was itself like some fascinating piece of equipment , smooth , unerring , its manipulations perfectly meshed : something that might have won an award for functional design . " A woman like that , " said Justin . I looked back from the girl to him . He set down his glass . " I 'm saying  --  a woman like that . Superb , phenomenal . " " I 'm sorry ? " " Your friend , I 'm saying . Gioconda . " It 's annoying , when you are putting things together in this way and have made them ; fit , to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For instance , I recall now that Gianni and Justin actually met  --  they did meet once , for a few minutes , a week or two after that , when Justin and I called one evening on Gioconda . As we were leaving , Gianni came in . I had not seen him since the night of Gioconda 's party . He was suntannedand looking well  --  looking fit , the expression would be , athletic and resilient . He was in a good mood , too  --  I remember dreading that he would talk his inane English to Justin , or come out with jokes about kilts and porrans ; I was apprehensive of Justin 's opinion of him , once more as if I were responsible . Instead it went well  --  the very reverse of the uneasy afternoon when I introduced Justin and Gioconda . They were civil with one another , and even exchanged some marine observa/tions connected with Gianni 's fishing expeditions off Libya . It turned out , too , that Justin had spent some weeks of war in a part of Africa once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in my time , " Gianni declared . " Three only . A German , a Dane , and me . We spoke Swahili with one another . " What a lie , thought I.Justin , laughing , came out with some throaty words , and added in English , " It 's all I remember  --  all I ever knew , in fact . " Gianni at once responded with what must , from his attitude , have been some little speech of complimentsor greeting . And I felt , at this unexpected , authenticaccomplishment , the same unwilling astonishment I had felt on first seeing Gianni 's apartment in Rome . Nothing more than that . They shook hands , and parted . It is only the fact that they met that surprises , cropping out in retrospect . It is one of those little dependenciesof memory that suddenly demand self-government . One is unreasonably angered with such a fact for existing , for making one wonder , as it does , what else has been forgotten . It spoils everything , and ought to be abolished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to death because he pointed out an unaccountableflaw in the mathematical theory of universal harmony ? Another missing item is the report  --  the one I was at work on all this time . The report is missing not for anyp171reason that alarms or touches me , however , but because it is not interesting enough to mention . The seasons I have described , the moods and incidents that shaded or illuminedour four lives , occupied a tiny fraction , only , of the many hours and days given over to my work on that report  --  hours and days during which I , along with others , converted sheaves and rolls and heavy piles of paper from a foreign language into a form of English that was in its way more alien to us . Yet , while I know exactly where , in Via Calabritto , I bought a pink silk shirt I sometimes wore to work , or can recall at will the jingle chanted by my portiere 's child when he brought me my letters , not a phrase of that report comes back to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and indented appendices on which , with technical dictionariesspread open under paperweights and annotated pages overflowing on to window-sills and chairs , I expandedthe greater part of my energies and days . The importance of our work was constantly brought home to us . That was one reason why we doubted it . But mainly it was the level of its presentation  --  in the narrowest , the most belligerent context  --  that repelled our confidence ; and the pathos of our superiors , their self-laudatory defending of the world from perils into which just such mentalities as theirs had plunged it . Lacking human reference , they reduced the most imperativematters to boredom : they might kill us , but they could never engage our interest.  |p172That  summer the city was less of a daily distraction than it had been at the start , for I had come to accept its apartness and its continuity  --  in the way that , in the course of a frightening dream , one comforts oneself , without waking , with the knowledge of reality and the certainty of returning to it . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more as they wished me to be ; never speaking now of the city or of my life in it , except to grumble companionably once in a while about a dishonest taxidriveror a disastrous dry-cleaner ; standing drinks at the Officers ' Club on the Queen 's Birthday and helping decoratethe corridor for the Fourth of July . As a show of good faith one might work up indignation over a telephonebreakdown , or because some folder of statistics arrived with a page missing . It was by the signs of dissatisfactionthat we were bound together . When our mission first came to Naples there had been continual talk about the necessity of adjusting to the area  --  the word adjusting reiterated as if we were nothing more than a set of short-wave radios that could , with a bit of fiddling , be tuned in to foreign programmes . The desirability of bearing up , or at least of not breaking down , had been impressed on us . It had never for a moment been intended that we should come to like the place . It was at Bagnoli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the habit of those warriors to deride as ineffectual the pleasures of the mind , a dynamism wasp173implied in the conduct of their own unspeculative lives . Yet I would pass them , those men of action , huddled over milk shakes in the American restaurant in Santa Lucia as I set out for Spaccanapoli , or would see them gloomily slumped there at the bar on my return from an expeditionto the islands . The pastel girls might take a bus to Amalfi or Ravello , Germani would escort his children into the crater of Vesuvius , " for an outing " as he said , but the timid activists seldom ventured far from the base . They spoke of food , and of losing weight ; some took photographs , some followed the stock market . Their clubs , their PX , and a flat in a streamlined building within striking distance of these  --  that was , ideally , the pattern of the life of adventure : supine , incurious , complaining , they awaited the command that would animate them . There were exceptions  --  which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , if pronounced , the subject of a dossier . Even the locally recruited clerks and couriers preferred , I think , the unexceptional , rather than have confusingelements in so consistent an establishment . By that summer I had given up using their real names of Gennaroor Carlo or Luigi , and was calling them Gerry and Louie and Charley just as everyone else did , and making them presents of cartons of Lucky Strikes bought at the I'X for the purpose . " You must do something very secret out there , " Gio/conda remarked once , and Gianni agreed , " God knows what she 's up to . She never says a word about it . " " If you knew , " I told them . " If you only knew how boring it is . " It was again the contrast between their lives and mine . They , who spent their days freely using their intelligence , could never conceive of work such as mine . " You could n't even imagine it . " Gianni groaned . " God almighty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And Gioconda said , " Will she never understand ? " Of all the Mezzogiorno , only the report did not recognisethe summer that year . As July came to a close , everything else slackened and changed . Those who could leave the city did so  --  the hot , dry , dirty streets were inhabited now only by the poor . The poor took the city over , appearing in big families or small battalions on Via Caracciolo or in Piazza dei Martiri  --  places where in winter they seldom showed themselves , or came as single spies . Along the seafront , any polluted point of access was alive with bathers , and a horde of near-naked childrenflapped and thrashed around the walls of Lucullus 's castle . The heart of the city became an interior , a dark centre of discomfort . Progress , in ripping out tracts of vineyard or vegetable garden , had only sealed that congested labyrinth more completely with concrete and bitumen , only made it the more unfit to bear its breathless summer . A portion of Spaccanapoli was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of San Gennaro , " though street was laid on street there , and house on house , as if they had been tangled together in an earthquake . Still they had their seasons , the pavements of Naples , those square stones of Via Tribunali or San Biagio dei Librai . In winter , nespole ripened there , pale spheres like unyielding apricots ; in summer figs , green or magenta ; and later there would be walnuts and lavender , and the fruit of the cactus . Heaped in cartons or baskets , spread on newspaper or simply on the ground , they burgeoned alongside piles of second-hand clothes and underclothes , beside mounds of threadbare blouses and discoloured corsets and all the other doubtful merchandisethat bloomed there perennially . Near Gioconda 's house , in summer , a man in a wheelchairused to sell goldfish , which were displayed swimmingabout in a blue plastic baby-bath . And once in a while near the Porta Capuana , I would come across a salesman of ordinary sparrows , fifty lire each , squatting on the steps of Santa Caterina and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cage . Gioconda was away a lot , spending the weekdays in the islands when the crowds were less . She made arrangements to visit her sister at Nice , then postponed them . " I ca n't face travelling at this time of year . At least not till after Ferragosto . At Nice , too , it 's frightful  --  crowds , you can imagine . Even Luciana writes me that Ip176should wait . " The truth was that she was unwilling to go so far from Gianni , and that she disliked leaving home . When I asked her what she would do in the summer , if she could freely choose , she laughed . " Perhaps in our old age , who knows , Gianni and I will be able to take trips to Assisi or Viareggio  --  come le coppie cafoni . " Gianni himself had been in Zurich on business , and at Venice ; had spent a fortnight at Portofino with his children . Returning , he had an accident  --  not a serious one , though he hurt his head and his knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Genoa and would be out of commissionfor a couple of months . " It must be a wreck , then , " I exclaimed , when Giocondatold me . " Not at all . It 's August  --  that 's the thing . Nobody works , nothing can be done . " Some days later , arriving at Naples in a rented car , Gianni joined Gioconda on Capri . Justin was to fly to Gibraltar at the end of the summer , and go on to Spain . From there he might go home to see his parents . In the autumn , he said , he would be back at Naples to finish his work with the Aquarium . I wondered whether , once away , he would return so soon , or ever . It pleased me to hear their plans , to think of them all going in different directions . It made me feel stable , settled , at peace , at home ; in a place , for the first time , that was not a preparation for another setting or a wider experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was immune to the mid-August holiday and its shiftingp177guises of calamity and release ; and to the endless repetition , " Before Ferragosto , " " After Ferragosto " . . . Only the report went on accreting , piling up , it seemed , more pages than we produced , being carried away in teetering loaves to be mimeographed into innumerablecopies all marked TOP SECRET . When we had dealt with displacement and dredging and docking , there was refuelling and provisioning and logistics , and when those had been cleared up there was always security to fall back on , for there was never enough of that . The Colonel , who had got hold of a small sailing boat and a Swedish girl friend , was genial these days and even went so far as to praise my industry , remarking that I seemed to be getting adjusted to Naples at last . Just before Ferragosto I fell ill . That morning Serafina went up to the street in my place and told the Colonel to go on to Bagnoli by himself . Finding Justin there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both . During his solitary drive the Colonel must have reflected on the coincidence of my illness with the approaching holiday , for he telephoned from the office to say that he was sending Germani back with the car to take me to the doctor . Although it meant getting dressed and making a winding journey up to the American Naval Hospital behind Naples , I was feeling sick enough to be glad of going there . A young officer took my temperature and diagnosed the Asian flu . " What 's your superior 's name ? "  |p178I  had learnt to recognise the Colonel in this description . From his office the doctor telephoned the Colonel and told him I must stay in bed until after the holidays . The Colonel having planted the seed of deception , I felt as grateful to this young man as if I had been malingeringand he had abetted me . Even Germani , helping me back into the car , assured me I did n't look well , as if there were some doubt about the validity of my case . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in full sight of the gulf of Naples . That high , open part of the city , the top tier of its arena , is a suburb , now , of identical modern blocks in pastel colours ; hypocrite officialdom , seeking to minimise its guilt by implicating others , has named for the poets the avenuesthat spawn these parti-coloured cubes ( " Like all those Piazza Mussolinis , " Gioconda used to say , " that became Piazza Matteottis overnight , and could change back some other night just as fast ; convenient , even to the number of letters " ) . But then it was still a countryside that looked to Naples on the one hand , and on the other across Pozzuoli to Cape Misenum . It was a fierce day , clear , hotly coloured , every rise and declivity of the city dryly distinct . Slums , fields , churches , mountains and sea unfurled themselves around the volcano as on the plan of some extravagant place that could exist only in fancy . Germani drove more and more slowly , he leaning forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected some climax to this great scene , might see it seized by some vast convulsion.  |p179We  came down to the shore at Mergellina , into streets already decorated for the festival of Piedigrotta , lankly strung with coloured bulbs as separate as ill-strung beads , melancholy in the midday sun . A hundred summercafes had flowered around the tiny port , and stalls decorated with shells were selling oysters and mussels and the mossy , shapeless seafood called " carnummola . " Red and purple , strung with floats of cork , the nets were spread there across the footpath and the road and , over it all , the children scrambled and darted with no sign of belonging , except to the city itself . At home , Justin called me . I told him , " I 'm ghastly sick . They say it 's Asian flu . " I told him about going to the hospital . " I really do feel seedy . " " Shall I come ? Can I do something ? " " Thanks , no , absolutely nothing . I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come tomorrow . " It was an appointmentwe had , to go to a concert in the amphitheatre at Pompeii . " Oh  --  the concert , that 's nothing . I 'll give the tickets to somebody or other . Only sorry you 're feeling seeders . " " No , do n't be silly . Of course you should go . . . Take someone else . " " For instance ? " " Well  --  I do n't know  --  there must be someone . A female colleague . " " They 're all married . Or unmarried . " " Someone from Bagnoli , then . " I was like a mother urging an unsociable child.  | " Your friend , " he said . " Shall I ask your friend ? " " My . . . ? Well of course . A good idea . " " I 'm only joking . " " But of course you could call her . Just the job . " " You think so ? Just the job ? Wo n't Don Giovanni put his stiletto in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Bloody , bold and resolute . That 's me . " We were silent , then he laughed . " What are you laughing at ? " " At the bare idea . Do you think that expression means bare in the sense of mere , or that the idea is being exposed to us , naked and undisguised ? " " Goodbye , " I said . " Look , I will come over this evening . See how you are . About seven , say . " I asked him , " Are you trying to redress the balance ? " " No . I am redressing the bare idea . " Justin came that evening to see me , and stayed for an hour or so . He made a jug of orange juice , and we sat in the living-room and drank it in the half-light because it was still too hot to open the shutters . Gioconda 's name was not mentioned between us  --  then , or ever again . Gioconda herself came to visit me a few days later . By then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , was empty ; while the sea , as I saw , was teeming with life . I had got up for her visit , and she begged me to go back to bed.  | " It 's too hot , " I told her . " Because I had to raise the shutters . I ca n't lie all day in a dark , room . " She remarked , " I suppose in America we would have air conditioning . " " In Africa we had ceiling fans . " It was the first time we had talked about the weather with one another . I turned my head to say this to her , but found her staring at me . " What 's the matter ? " " You look so sick . You told me it was only the flu . " " So it is . There 's an epidemic . I 'll be better in a few days . " " In a few days I 'll be gone , to Nice . It 's all arranged . . . Look after yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're really going ? " " Yes , I must . It 's time . I 'll be back soon  --  three weeks or so . " I wondered about Gianni , whether he would visit her there , whether he had come to Naples over the holiday ; but for once she had not mentioned him . When she got up to go I put my hand on her arm , and said , " How different from when you were leaving Naples last time , for Tripoli . " But the recollection hurt her , for she covered my hand with hers and did not smile , and I was sorry to have spoken of it . She leant forward to embrace me , but I told her , " Keep away , " and she drew back instantly . " I do n't want you to come down with anything . " After she had gone I realised I had been expecting Justin , who sometimes came by at that time of day , and was glad that he had not come  --  because , illogically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . But when he did arrive , late and in a hurry , then perversely I wished I might have seen them together ; as it would not be the same another time , afterwards , when the summer was over . When I was discovered to have hepatitis , even the Colonel came to see me . It was the only time he ever came to my flat , and Serafina was proud of my having him there and completely taken in by his moustache and by the campaign ribbons pinned to his summer uniform . I remember nothing of what I said to him , being by that time very ill and forgetful of his existence , let alone his presence ; but I do recall that he urged me not to worry about the report , which he felt must be on my mind . Serafina impressed him , too , and because of that I was not made to go to hospital as everybody wished , but remainedat home throughout the confused weeks that followed . When , after Ferragosto , I had got no better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brought me home re-diagnosed as a serious case . There was no one now for me to pass on this news to , other than the Colonel  --  for that morning Justin had flown to Spain in a plane belonging to the United States Navy . I did write a calm note to Norah telling her I had jaundice , and she wrote hysterically back saying I must be very careful and that this was prevalent in Italy . She and Edmundp183had tried to ring me up , but the telephone system of Naples was one too many for them . In fact the telephone seldom rang during those weeks , except for enquiries that came from the office . Even in the worst of the illness I would think of Bagnoli and the PX and the report and the Colonel , and be glad to be free of them and at home , nauseated , feverish , and turning deep yellow . When you are ill you can only be yourself  --  whereas in an office one is required always to be somewhat false , at least when one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office life struck me , even at the time . Mostly my thoughts were not so coherent , and once or twice visited by passages of delirium . In the jumble of those indistinguishable nights and days , two things grotesquely predominated . One was the festival of Piedigrotta , whose songs surged into my rooms from Mergellina and from every radio on the Posillipo . All night the celebrations flared red and green around my walls in fireworks and floodlighting , recreatingan active volcano at the other  --  the wrong  --  end of the harbour ; in the day , causing foreign contestants ( for no Neapolitan would have contemplated so useless an expenditure of energy , and the race was always won by a Dane or a New Zealander ) to swim out to Capri , and skiffs to tack back and forth around a series of buoys . The festival was of the same official duration as the active period of my illness : it reached its own climax , and enteredits own decline.  |p184The  other thing was an ineradicable scent , exotic , sickening , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from where . Until I was quite recovered I was always conscious of that sweet smell , and never found out where it came from , how it had infiltrated the mind , perhaps , or the imagination , rather than the nostrils . Perhaps it lingered from some tuberoses Justin once brought me ; or from the perfume , with one of those names  --  Sin , or Scandal , or Woman  --  that Gioconda always wore.  |p185MI  GIOCONDA GONE , Justin in Spain , I had no visitors . Thefew casual acquaintances who might have come were off to islands or mountains . Each morning Serafina let herself in , and that was the only interruption in identical days that I passed in bed or , when the disease began to ebb , out on the terrace . The mere fact of growing less ill , the privacy and silence of those high rooms , the emancipation from bureaucracy , brought pleasure of a kind I had never known ; pleasure that was far from negative , though it owed so much to lack ; that , in lookinginward rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even of youth but of childhood . Below the windows there was always something going on . In the earliest morning there were boats below , on a sea at that hour indistinguishable from inflamed sky ; one lone boat , or a pair , or a group of them drawing up nets or lobster pots . No sound ever came landward from these boats except sounds of the sea  --  soft plashings of their work , or the mild collisions of hull and tide . If the fisher/men spoke to one another , it was in voices too low to reach the shore . The men , like the boats , were weathered , single-purposed , uncolourful . In each of their practised movements there was the intentness , the restraint , that suggest not an industry but an existence . They were always there . Throughout the day , when the water near the rocks was logged with swimmers and with rafts and sailing boats , there on the periphery would be one of these boats , a wedge of grey or brown in that kaleidoscope , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to be seen rocking on the wash of a pleasurelaunchor in the wake of the fast white ferry bound for Ischia . In the night , no matter what hour one looked for them , they were out with acetylene lamps and you could see the single figure standing in the stern with the oars , and the other kneeling at the prow and bending into a circle of clear green light . At first during that convalescence I could do nothing but watch . Walking from one room to the next was exhausting , a few pages of a magazine or a book brought tears of fatigue . Sometimes I slept right through the morning and woke to find a tray on the bedside table and Serafina gone . But nothing intruded on my new pleasure ; all this time was mine . One morning it rained . Waking late I found the room dim , and the bathers ' screams suspended . The gulf was grey with rain that fell steadily , discreetly , without thunder . There was no wind , but for the first time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I pulled up a chair and sat at the terrace doors in an immense relief : I 'd had no idea how much I had missed the rain . The hills , the buildings , the boats looked refreshed and grateful . The sea itself seemed to be thirsty . I greeted Serafina with " The rain ! " as if it were a development that vitally affected both of us . She at once reproved me , it was a sprinkling only : " Sghizzichea . " And over the breakfast dishes she loudly sang a tragic song , " How it rains . Ggiesu , how it rains . " The next day was fair again , the bathers were back . But the break was there , you felt it . We had got to the end of summer and there had been a change . I began to sleep less and to be interested in food . Germani drove me up to the hospital two or three times for blood tests in which a dye was injected into my vein to illuminate the declining course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and a Get Well card signed by all the office  --  the local staff having inscribed their names dutifully at the bottom , surname first , one neatly under the other like a petition . With an eye to conditions at Naples , the PX must have stocked up heavily with Get Well cards , for any number of these , each one different , ultimately reached me . The first Saturday after the rain everybody was out using up what now remained of the good weather . Some were there at sunrise , lining the rocks like early risers getting first place for a spectacle . It was September , ap188ripe , flawless day . I was lying on the bed in a dressinggown , reading . Serafina had said goodbye to me and gone to the door . I heard her talking to someone as she let herself out , and a man 's voice said impatiently , " That 's all right . Go , go . " " No " was repeated two or three times , and the door closed loudly . And the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jenny . " Strangely , I thought at first that it might be my brother standing there so unexpectedly , or even Justin , and I could not take in the fact of its being Gianni . I had not been thinking much about Gianni , and it took a second or two to get the idea of his being there . But it was Gianni  --  Gianni was standing in the doorway of my room with a sheaf of flowers , wrapped up , beneath his arm . He himself looked bewildered , as if I had taken him by surprise . He had a light-coloured suit on and a blue shirt , and looked very well dressed , almost dandified . Then I saw it was all wrong , the way he looked and his turning up like that . And even before I absorbed that realisation , I had said , " What is it , what 's happened ? " One talks of being speechless with shock , but there are times when the comprehending words are uttered before the brain has formed their meaning . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself : if there had been a calamity , a death , he would n't have stopped to get me flowers . He was looking at me in that way , puzzled and alarmed . I raised myself against the pillows as he camep189across the room and stood beside the bed . He suddenly dropped his bunch of flowers  --  that is , he just moved his arm as if the flowers were not there , and they fell to the floor with a paper crash . At the same moment I put my book face-down on the sheets . This laying down of our weapons occurred as he seated himself on the edge of my bed  --  not greeting me or taking my hand , but trembling all over like a domestic animal that has seen something wild . Awareness of a sick-room , of my condition , seemed to work on him vaguely and to introduce some echo of restraint over whatever it was he had to tell me . " You do n't know , " he said . " Gianni , my God , what is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Spain . " " To Spain ? " " Gioconda 's left me . " But he gave , in stating this , no impression of delivering himself of what he had to say . He had information for me , I could see it . He hesitated again , and then he said , " She 's with the Scotsman . " It was bizarre , his saying it like that , " lo Scozzese "  --  the comic name he had used for Justin , uttered in this context devoid of comedy . The knowledge was both physicaland mental , like an electric shock . I could feel it entering my ears and breast and fingers , circulating in me . " Do you understand me , Jenny ? " Gianni 's impulse to break the news gently was transfigured , as I stayed silent ,  |p190into  the need to urge the situation on me and obtain a response comparable to his own . " With your friend . " It came to me how Justin had said , " Your friend . Your friend Gioconda . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Gioconda . I felt the same new , frightening surprise I had experienced on learning that I had a recognised , serious disease , not just a passing ailment that the system would absorb and forget within hours or days . I felt knowledge , as I say , coursing in my body , making everything different . Gianni leant forward for a moment , his elbows on his knees , his hands over his eyes . I thought he must be weeping , but he looked up dry-eyed , as if he had merely been trying to concentrate on a complicated matter . He looked terrible , his face whitely disarrayed ; one could not say that he suddenly looked like an old man , but you could see how he would be in age , the fullness turned to folds , the eyes more fixed . At the same time he looked better too , more like a real person . I still had not spoken to him . I could hear his breathing , heavy and regular , like a patient in anaesthesia . " Tosca told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's been lying there ten days . " " What do you mean ? Lying where ? " " San Biagio . She telephoned me , Gioconda , almost three weeks ago , and said she was n't going to Nice . She asked me to come to Naples . " " You did n't come . "  |p191He  shouted , " No . " He controlled himself , laid his hands , now , on his knees to steady them , to steady himself . " I came only this morning . I 've come this moment from San Biagio . I thought she would still be there . " So there had been a calamity after all . The flowers were for Gioconda . " You had n't been in touch with her ? " He shook his head . " You were punishing her , " I said , punishing him . " We had a quarrel . " Gianni made a pronouncement of this , as if their relations had been otherwise unclouded . " Over my life in Rome . Over a woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her letter has been there all this time , right there on the table in the hall . " This fact of the letter lying there like an undetonated explosive was the last straw for him . I knew what he felt : to me too the tranquillity of my convalescence now appeared to have taken place in grotesque ignorance of this . " You can read it . It says nothing  --  I mean , nothing more . She mentions you . She says she has n't been able to write it to you  --  but I thought at first you might have known . From him . " I took Gioconda 's note from him and read it . They may be married by now , I thought , handing it back . Gianni folded it and put it into his wallet , carefully , as though conserving a piece of evidence . He put the wallet back into his trouser pocket , stretching out his leg to do so , his foot grazing the paper cone that contained the flowers . He said to me , " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the caption of a silent film . He got up distractedly and walked round the bed . Coming back and standing beside me he put his palm against his breast . " A blow . Just what people say  --  I 've had a blow . That 's how it feels . As if I 'd been struck by force . " He turned away once more and walked over to the terrace doors and stood there , a violet shape against the light . I heard the shuddering sounds of his tears . It was appalling , this humbling of Gianni  --  as once before , when I had seen him plead with Gioconda and be refused ; and compounded by the contrast with his accustomedfacility for tears . I lay listening to him , so exquisitely aware of his grief that every detail on which my eye fell  --  the crease of a sheet , the fissure in a tile , the slight stain around the doorknob  --  commanded attention and became significant , as if my perceptions were trying to divert me out of self-preservation , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I swung my legs down from the bed to go to him , but as I got to my feet he turned abruptly and was at my side again . Gianni 's sudden presence , and the effort of rising , affected my balance . Standing barefoot on the little rug by the bed , I swayed slightly and took a step aside . He put out his hand to steady me , grasping my arm above the elbow , his fingers completely circling the flesh through the cotton gown . The contact recalled me to him  --  recalled me , that is ,  |p193as  my self rather than as , simply , the recipient of his news  --  for he stared into my face with a shifting of sights , and again with the look of puzzlement and recognition . " You 're so thin , Jenny . " Without changing its pressure , his hand on my arm acknowledged this , and his voice altered . " Almighty God , you 're thin . " It is hard to convey , now , why it was touching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . It was like the rain  --  I had not realised , until it fell , how deprived of it I had been , how greatly life had been lacking in this perfectly ordinary element . Tears  --  of weakness , loneliness , self-pity  --  rose to my own eyes . But most of all it was moving , this digression of Gianni 's , by its show of a spontaneous human concern . The simple physical fact of Gianni taking hold of my arm and noticing how thin it had become gave us back for a moment our sense of existing outside of Gioconda 's departure , and of being subject to human sensations other than suffering . Far from giving a sense of proportion , as it is said to do , disaster throws everything out of perspective : and this exchange of ours was hopelessly bound up with the disruption , the detail of my thinness merely thrown into relief by it  --  enhanced by it , in fact , like the cracked tile or the stain on the door . Gianni still held my arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs touching the cool metal frame of the bed . We said nothing . The cries from the sea , whichp194throughout this time had gone unheard , were all at once raucous and urgent , as if someone had unthinkingly turned up their volume . " So thin , Jenny , " Gianni repeated , to pass the time , it might have been , while we entered into another stage of experience . Without slackening his encircling fingers  --  as though my arm represented some source of meaning  --  Gianni embraced me , and I leant against him . His face , wet with tears shed for Gioconda , was lowered to mine . And when at last we lay down together , his hand , then releasing me , reached up from habit to the back of my head , to grope for the tortoise-shell comb he was accustomed to unclaspingthere . Gianni and I sat by my windows in the dark , I in a deep chair with my legs beneath me , he on a stool alongside . My hand , over the chair-arm , rested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspense . " She wo n't stay with him . " " That 's it , " said Gianni . " Tell me she 'll come back . For it 's all I can stand at the moment . " " She will , " I obediently answered . As Gianni pointed out , it was necessary to get him through this day . " For him , it must be . . . " " A grand passion . " " Yes . For her , it can only be  --  " I was going to say " despair " ; but left it , again , unfinished . This time Gianni did not supply the word.  | " Perhaps she has already left him . " " Perhaps . " Gianni said , " The poor bastard . " Then , simply , " The bastard . " He lit a cigarette and threw the match out over the terrace into the sea . When the cigarette was finished , he did the same with the end of it . " Gianni , " I said at length . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use blaming her . " It was my turn , now , to tell him things . Gianni touched his head against my shoulder . " Sweet . " " It might even be that you would be different with her . " " What you mean is , it might be a lesson to me , " said Gianni , but not smiling . " It might make you kinder . " " Perhaps . " Gianni looked doubtful . " The thing is , I do n't think I could keep it up . It would be all right for a while , and then it would all be the same again . I do n't know that I could change . " " On the contrary . I 'm talking about your becoming more like yourself . " " That might be worse , in the end . " We were talking about him as we might have done behind his back . " Besides , I have no desire to turn into one of those men you see about  --  reformed characters , you know ; who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the lights lifting and sinking inp196the water , the lights strung up the side of Vesuvius , the lighted curve of the town tapering away to darkness . Gianni moaned , thinking I suppose that Gioconda might not come back , and that if she did he might never see her . " Let me stay tonight . " And he added ingenuously , " I ought not to be by myself . " I thought of how Gioconda had said to me , " Of course I could not bear it if , at the end of the day , it was you who were to go to bed with him . " I had put Gianni 's flowers in a big glass vase , and they stood on a table near the windows , immense snapdragons , dozens of them , fierce and velvety , purple and orange and red . They had lain all afternoon on the bedroomfloor . " They 'll revive , " I said . " The flowers . Tomorrow they 'll be fine . " I began to dread tomorrow and how this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " They 're Gioconda 's favourite flower . " In this way it came about that on the following SaturdayGianni returned to Naples and did not go to San Biagio dei Librai.  | " TODAY I WENT OUT , some few miles above Seville , to see the ruins of Italica . Do you remember I laughed , Jenny , at the idea of leaving Italy to visit Roman ruins  --  yet there I was walking a rough path among long dry grass , as grateful as any legionary for these familiar sights . Civis Romanus sum , it would appear . Because the walls are all down , and the site on high ground , there is an open , windswept atmosphere up there  --  difficult to imagine that the mosaic pavements were ever enclosed in houses or that the skyline was ever obscured by something more than the few cypresses that stand today . At the gate of the place , where one pays to enter , there was a poem inscribed that I thought you would have liked  --  a Spanish poet , and all I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruins like a public insult . In contrast with such astringency , such light and air , Herculaneum seems claustrophobic , a dense , decadent little enclave  --  too pleasurable , too ingrown . Too much like home.  | " Otherwise  --  I have been in a great cathedral here in Seville , and walked under screens of vines in charming streets , visited the Alcazar . The avenues are lined with orange trees , the parks are still filled with flowers . It is all as mournful to me as if it were draped in black . Once I stopped at the edge of a garden to look at an inscription on a pretty house , thinking it perhaps another poem : insteadit announced the headquarters of the Falange . Spain seems all like that  --  you never know whether it is to be poetry or horrors , or the two combined . Something evil is always turning up to remind me how things are , how I am . " What I would like is  --  to come home . Instead , tomorrow , I am going to Madrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will be back at Naples before the end of the year . If you can bring yourself to regard this as what it is  --  a low point in life , in my life  --  perhaps we shall meet . . . This evening I spend sitting here with the potted palms in a huge , glassed-over courtyard of the hotel  --  cold in spite of heating and in spite of a tumbler of Spanish scotch . There are two or three other people in a far corner who are whispering as if this were the cathedral itself , and the air of sobriety would be total were it not for a poor mad girl in beautiful clothes who sits talking to herself and occasionally gets up and wandersround the empty tables pulling the flowers out of their little vases as if she were rehearsing Ophelia . She is fair and quite lovely , though emaciated , and the mostp199dreadful thing of all is the gravity with which the waiters answer her preposterous questions , conspiring against her with her infirmity . What else can they do ?  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When this is no longer bearable , I 'll go and have dinner  --  in a vast restaurant off the courtyard , in which at this season only one or two tables are occupied though all are laid  --  then go upstairs . My room has a solemn luxury  --  dark wood , double doors with polished fittings , exquisite linen : being comfortable is not something taken lightly here . It is all wonderfully dated , yet wonderfullykept up to date , like one of those antiquated motor-cars that has never been bettered and is in perfect running order  --  you know the kind , when you lift up the bonnet the engine is immaculate , its caps and taps glittering , all bronze and brass . . . In fact this hotel seems to be expecting , even to merit , something better than human guests  --  as if it had been intended for some superior order of being . I feel it must regard us , poor crazed and muddled mortals trailing over its marble floors , as a public affront , like the weeds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home ; and to have familiar things , things that would make me less unfamiliar to myself . Today the hairdresser told me that my hair is ' may castigado ' from the summer teasing : I too am much punished from the summer teasing , and wish I were leaving for Naples , not for Nice . . . "  |p200Years  later I arrived one spring evening in Seville , not alone , and sat in the glass-domed courtyard of Gioconda'sletter , among the ferns and palms . Watched over by a sombre waiter and one or two wintry guests , the two of us made up , from a dish of salted crackers formed in letters of the alphabet , love-words that we spread out on our little table . We had managed to compose an indecent phrase or two before the waiter 's approach forced us to eat our words . Looking out our bedroom window before dawn we saw a group of cab-drivers in the street below warming themselves at a bonfire lighted on the pavement , while one of their number read to them from an outstretchednewspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had died . Walking out in the city for the first time , we found it swathed in black , draped , wreathed , shuttered , depopulated : grotesquely adapted to the image of Gioconda in her sorrow walking these same streets , as if the city were , nightmarishly , living out one 's private associations with it . What stayed with me after reading Gioconda 's letter was the completeness of Justin 's disappearance from our lives . She asked nothing better than to take up her life as if he had never entered it ; just as I wished now to go on , leaving him behind . Her chaotic flight had freed Giocondafrom unnatural sacrifice ; it had freed me from idealisation of her . Even Gianni , according to my rea/soning , stood , in his grief , to regain himself . Only Justin remained unaccounted for , not a beneficiary under this distribution of spoils . He seemed fictitious , a sort of subplot , something that had no existence other than to augmenther experience and mine , to contribute to our legend . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language , of manner , of making love  --  he had constructed ; had become their victim , like those heavily fortified towns that invite their own downfallby suggesting that there is something within to be assaulted . He had made himself appear , in retrospect , too easily elucidated  --  more so than Gianni , who was constantly exposing and betraying himself , and of whom there had yet remained something to discover . Folding Gioconda 's letter and putting it carefully back  --  as carefully as Gianni had done  --  into its envelope , I said aloud the name not mentioned in it : " Justin Tulloch . " The words made no change , did nothing to bring him to life ; unless by leaving , echoless , the sense of incompletion . Justin , if I hoped to exorcise you by pronouncing your name that day , for the last time , I was unsuccessful . For no name has haunted me as yours has . Why  --  when a single properly directed enquiry would have provided the answer  --  have I looked for and failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thin or weighty , from Brussels to Chicago ; and once in Hollywood , bal/ancing the flopping volume on my knee and turning pages while a voice droned on in the receiver about the creative impulse . Justin Tulloch  --  Tulloch , Justin ; Tulloch , Justin P. ; Tulloch , J. P.  --  it was your name that came to find me , after all , one day . This summer  --  the summer , that is , of this year that has just passed  --  my husband , who is a lawyer , had business to do at Pinner . Pinner was once a pretty , village-likeplace , and not , as it has now become , a suburb of London . It was a Saturday late in August when , after weeks of icy rain , the weather had suddenly turned hot , brilliant and dry . While the business was being done , I walked through the town . The High Street ( I suppose it was a High Street ) ran down a short hill , and boasted , as the quite inappropriate saying goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into was , like all the tea-rooms of childhood , a combination of dun distemper and darker varnish . No arrow of that bright afternoon could pierce its leaded dark-grey panes , glassily dimpled as though by the impression of innumerable fingertips ; or illumine the pinched lady  --  counterpart of a thousand others  --  who with a schoolroom gesture of her furled menu pointed out an empty chair at the end of the low , close room . The place was hot with summer and humanity . In tearoomsin England one must often share a table . Tea and cakes for the three other women at my table  --  there was not one man in that crowded place  --  had just beenp203brought on a wooden tray . The ringleader of the three dispensed cups and saucers , forks and plates to her friends , reaching out in constricted gestures . She wore a sleeveless cotton dress printed with pink flowers , and her middle-aged , sunless white arms were too prominent  --  vulnerable and touching ; she herself seemed conscious of the exposure as she repeatedly extended and withdrew them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from the floor by my chair somebody 's discarded copy of that day 's newspaper . By pushing the chair back a little against the mustard wall , I could open the paper in my lap . Flowered woman set hand on flowered teapot . " Shall I be Mother ? " Cups , not matching , were extended . " Just as it comes . " I turned pages of the newspaper , in the total privacy of these few inches that were my inviolable claim on our table . We exchanged no looks , no words ; unaffectedly they spoke , as if I were not there . I liked their ability to carry this off . " I heard they went to Venice for the honeymoon . " " But only for a week . " When the tea came I managed to re-fold the newspaper , my elbows gouging my sides , and propped it between me and the table . It was placed so that the lower section of a page was visible . I helped myself to tea , and to a yellow cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know all about Pavlov and his robots I care to know , namely , that every time a dog salivates a behaviorist psychologist has to ring a bell . ) ( All right . Boss ? Can we spend a little more money ? ) ( Go ahead , buy the Pyramids . What do you want , dearest ? ) ( Let 's have a Triple-A-One snoop search run on me . Eunice Branca , I mean  --  the me ' that used to be . ) ( Why , beloved ? If you 've been selling government secrets , they ca n't touch you now . ) ( Because . It might fill some of those holes I think I have in my memory . . . and it might turn up something you 've heard from me since I came back but which was not in the security report you got on me originally . Then you would know , dear . . . and could stop worrying that I may be only a figment of your imagination . ) ( Eunice , if I 'm crazy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrink might cure me . Then you would go away . ) ( That 's sweet of you , Boss . But I wo n't go away ; I promised . ) ( And even if I am crazy , it just makes me fit that much better into the present world . Eunice , do n't you remember anything between being killed and waking up here ? ) The inner voice was silent a moment . ( Not really . There were dreams and I think you were in them . But there was one that does not seem like a dream ; it seems as real as this room . But if I tell you , you 'll think I am crazy . ) ( If so , it does n't detract from your charm , dear . ) ( All right but do n't laugh . Joan , while I was away , I was in this  --  place . There was an old , old Man with a long white beard . He had a great big book . He looked at it , then He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a naughty girl . But not too naughty , so I 'm going to give you a second chance . ' ) ( A dream , Eunice . Anthropomorphism , straight out of your childhood Sunday School . ) ( Maybe , Boss . But here I am and I do have a second chance . ) ( Yes , but God did n't give it to you . Eunice my own , I do n't believe in God nor Devil . ) ( Well . . . you have n't been dead  --  and I have . Truly I do n't know what I believe ; I guess I was n't dead long enough to find out . But do you mind if we pray occasionally ? ) ( Jesus H. Christ ! ) ( Stop that , Joan ! Or I 'll use every one of those words you consider unladylike . ' It 's not much to ask . ) ( I 'm henpecked . Okay . If it 's a beautiful church , with good music , and the sermon is n't over ten minutes . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Can'tp117stand ' em . Filled with bad vibrations . I mean pray by ourselves , Joan . I 'll teach you . ) ( Oh . All right . Now ? ) ( No , I want to get these search orders in . You think about something else ; I do n't want centipede trouble  --  think about Winnie all slickery with soapsuds . ) ( A pious thought . Much better than prayer . ) ( Dirty old man . how do you know  --  I ' 11 bet you 've never prayed in your life . ) ( Oh , yes , I have , dearest  --  but God had gone fishing . ) ( So think about Winnie . ) She was busy for several minutes . Then she patted the machine affectionately and switched it off . ( Well , did you ? ) ( Did I what ? ) ( Did you think about Winnie ? Lecher . ) ( I took advantage of the unusual peace and quiet to contemplate the wonders of the universe . ) ( So ? ) ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I was right with you . Joan , for a girl who is , in one sense at least , a virgin , you have an unusually low and vivid imagination . ) ( Aw , shucks , I 'll bet you say that to all the girls . ) ( The stark truth , Joan sweet  --  with your imagination I can hardly wait for you to start us on that actively female ' career . In all the wrestling I 've done I 've never had a man  --  or a girl  --  grab me the way you were thinking about . ) ( Oh . Learned that one from a respectable housewife , clear back in my teens . A most charming lady . ) ( Hmm ! Perhaps I was born too late for the real action . ) ( So I 've been trying to tell you . Did you get those orders in ? ) ( Certainly , Boss , when did I ever miss ? Let 's get back to our chair ; our back is tired . ) Joan Eunice negotiated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had kicked off her pumps to handle the lower controls of the stenodesk more easily ; the rug simply felt good to her bare feet . Then she did notice as she sat down in the big easy chair and folded her legs in the awkward , elegant , and surprisingly comfortable Lotus position . But it did not seem worthwhile to go get them . The door buzzer sounded . " It 's me , Winnie . " " Come in , dear . " The nurse entered . " Mr. Salomon asked me to tell you that he will be in to see you in a few minutes . But he ca n't stay for dinner . " " He 'll stay . Come here and kiss me . What did you tell Cunningham ? " " Dinner for two , in here , just as you said  --  to be served when you rang . But Mr. Salomon seemed quite firm about leaving . " " I still say he 'll stay . But if he does n't , you come eat dinner with me . Would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piano . " The nurse looked , fetched the pumps , stood over Joan Eunice , andp118sighed . " Joan , I do n't know what to do about you . You 've been a bad girl again . Why did n't you ring ? " " Do n't scold me , dear . Here , sit on the stool and lean against my knees and talk . There . Now tell me- By any chance were you ever a lady 's maid before you took nurse 's training ? " " No . Why ? " " You did such a fine job of taking care of me in the bath and getting me pretty . Well , it was just a thought . I do n't suppose a nurse-a professional woman-would consider a job as a maid . No matter how high the salary . But Dr. Garcia is going to insist that I have a nurse after he leaves . I do n't need a nurse and you know it . But dear Doctor will insist . I do need a maid ; I wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . Not to mention knowing nothing about makeup . Or buying women 's clothes . What are you paid now , Winnie ? " The nurse told her . " Goodness ! No wonder they 're always saying there 's a shortage of nurses . I ca n't hire an in-house guard at that price . What would you think of staying on as my nurse-but actually doing things for me that a maid would do and I do n't know how to do-at three times your present salary ? With whatever you wish paid in cash so that you wo n't have to report it ? " The redhead looked thoughtful . " How would you want me to dress , Joan ? " " That 's up to you . Your white nurse 's uniform , if you prefer it-since you 'll be my nurse in Dr. Garcia 's eyes . Or what you wish . There 's a bedroom through that door where my valet used to sleep . With a nice bath- and another room beyond it which we can redo as your living room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private apartment . " ( Boss , what was that about not shooting ducks on water ? ) ( Stuff it , Eunice . If she takes the bait , it 's better than hiring some illit and having to train her-and then have her steal the jewelry and drop out about the time she 's some use . ) ( Oh , I see advantages . But you place Winnie one unlocked door away and she 'll be in bed with you before you can say Sappho . ' You may not want men in our life-but I do . ) ( Oh , nonsense ! She 's already thinking about the money . If she takes the job , she 'll be more standoffish-she'llstart calling us Miss ' again . ) " Miss Joan ? It 'll really be my own apartment ? I can entertain ? " " Of course , dear . Private . Oh , Cunningham 's staff will clean and so forth , any service you want . Breakfast tray , whatever . Or never enter it if you prefer it that way . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with two other girls . . . at a rentp119that 's horrid because it 's inside an enclave . Safe  --  but I never have anyprivacy . " " Winnie . Look at me , dear , and lay it on the line . The bed in there now is , I believe , a single . Would you like to have it replaced with a big , big double bed ? " The girl blushed . " Uh , it would be nice . " " So stop blushing . I wo n't know you have a visitor unless you tell me ; that door is soundproof . Of course visitors have to be identified and checked for weapons , just as visitors to an enclave have to be  --  but that simply means you must vouch for a visitor to my chief guard the first visit . But I wo n't know it unless you choose to tell me . The in-house staff all have visitors . But security is my chief guard 's worry , not mine . " " But he does have to show his I.D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to Chief O'Neil but  --  Hold the countdown . Did you mean he would rather not show an I.D. ? Is he married , or something ? " Winnie blushed again , did not answer . Joan Eunice went on , " Nobody 's business , dear . This is a private home , not a government compound . You vouch for him , that 's enough . Chief O'Neil does n't trust I.D.s ; they 're often faked . But he has a photographic eye . Are you going to stay with me ? As nurse in residence , or lady 's companion , or social secretary , or whatever you want to call it . " " Lady 's maid . If I 'm to be your maid , Miss Joan , I 'd rather that your staff knew it and no pretense . And dress as your maid . What sort of uniform ? Traditional ? Or Acapulco ? Or something in between ? " " Oh , not traditional , surely ; you have such pretty legs . All-out Acapulco , if you like . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A girl gets tired of these white coveralls . " ( Joan ! Tell her not to use an all-out Acapulco paint job . Bad for her skin . ) " Suit yourself , dear . But do n't use a lot of paint . Bad for your skin . " " Oh , I know ! I 'm a real redhead , you probably noticed . I ca n't even sunbathe . I was thinking of a little black frill skirt with a white lace apron about the size of a saucer . Little perky maid 's cap , white on a black ribbon . Cling-On cups , in black . Transparent ? Or opaque ? " " Whichever suits you , Winnie . High heels ? " " Uh , translucent , I guess , like the panels in that nightie . High heels , certainly , or the effect is lost -- I can wear real stilts if I 'm barefooted most of the time . Then just enough paint for accent . There are lovely decals that go on in no time and come right off with cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything I mentioned I can buy in disposables . I 'll look like a proper lady 's maid , yet not spend more time getting dressed than I do in pulling on this smock and tights . " " You 'll look cute , dear . Going to dress up in a maid 's outfit and model it for your friend ? " Winnie started to blush again , then grinned . " I certainly am ! And let him take it off me , too ! " ( Cheers ! ) ( Eunice , you have a one-track mind . ) ( You should know , dearie  --  it 's your mind . ) A few moments later Winnie announced Mr. Salomon , then left . The lawyer came toward Joan solemnly , took the hand she extended and bowed over it . " How are you feeling ? " he asked . " Disappointed , " Joan answered soberly . " Because my oldest and dearest friend has n't time to dine with me my first day up . But physically I feel fine . Weak , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not overdoing ? " " I 'm sure . My respiration and heartbeat are being telemetered  --  if I were n't all right , someone would come in and order me to bed . Truly , I 'm all right , Jake  --  and I wo n't get strong unless I do stay out of bed . But how about you , old friend ? I have been terribly worried . " " Oh , I 'm all right . Just made a fool of myself , Johann . " " You did not make a fool of yourself ... and I feel certain Eunice knows it , Jake . " ( Watch it , Boss ! ) ( Pipe down . ) " You could have paid her no finer tribute than those honest tears . " Joan found her own tears starting ; she encouraged them while ignoring them . " She was a sweet and gallant lady , Jake , and it touched me more than I can say to learn that you appreciated her wonderful qualities as much as I did . Jake  --  please sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something I must ask you . " " Well . . . all right . Ca n't stay long . " " Whistle that chair closer , and face me . Uh , a glass of sherry ? Doctor says I may have it -- and I find that I need it . That Spanish cocktail sherry , dry as your wit . Will you do me the honor of pouring for us ? " Joan waited until the lawyer had filled their glasses , and had seated himself . She raised her glass and at the same time raised her chest , letting those " wicked " panels do their best . " A toast , Jake  --  no , do n't get up . The same toast , Jake  --  always the same toast from now on whenever you and 1 drink together . . . but silently . " She took a sip and put her glass down . " Jake " " Yes . . . Johann ? " " Joan , ' please  --  I ca n't be Johann ' any longer . Jake , you know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a  --  device . A legal device . " " Yes , Jolla  --  Yes , Joan , I knew . That 's why I helped . " " I knew . The most generous act of friendship I have ever known . What is it the Japanese name it ?  --  the friend who helps , when it is necessary to die . Never mind . Jake , look me in the eye . Do you know , deep in your heart , that I would rather be dead . . . than to have lived through it by this incredible circumstance ? Be alive . . . at her expense ? Do you know that , Jake ? Or must I live still another life , hating myself ? " Salomon raised his eyes , met hers firmly . " Yes  --  Joan . I know it . It was no fault of yours . . . you must not hate yourself . Uh . . . Eunice would n't want you to ! " " 1 know ! Weep , dear Jake ; do n't hold back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . Just try not to go to pieces , or I will , too . Jake , each of us would happily have died rather than let this happen . I am as certain of it about you as I hope you are about me . I do n't think I could stand it if you had not reassured me . Look at me  --  a lovely body and young  --  yet I am almost ninety-five years old and have not one friend left alive . . . but you . " " You 'll make more friends . " " I wonder if I can . The span is great , perhaps too great . I feel as the Wandering Jew must have felt , alive beyond his allotted time . His name  --  Aha  --  something . My memory is not as good as this young body . But I ca n't forget one question which I must ask . Jake , is there any possibility that Eunice 's husband had something to do with her death ? That prize I put up , that blood money  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're way off base . I know ! ) ( Sorry , beloved , more sorry than I can say . But I must have proof . ) " Jake ? Did I entice a murder ? " The lawyer shook his head . " I 'm astounded . But of course you do n't know the circumstances . You enticed nothing . I wrote that offer most carefully . Were there any guilt I would share it . There was none . " " How do you know ? " ( Drop it , Boss . Please ! ) " Mr. Branca was in Philadelphia , visiting his mother . " ( You see , Boss ? ) " I had to find him to get the post-death ratification . Took three days , while both of you were kept ready for surgery . Joe Branca did n't know she was dead . Hell of a job even to find him . Three long days . " " Three days . ' Why was n't I told ! " " And waste Eunice 's death ? Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as I notified him that a body was going to be ready . Then that dreadful wait . I need your forgiveness , too , for  --  Joanp122no , Johann ! ' I hated you . . . for being alive when she was dead . But I pushed on  --  for her sake . Oh , I got over it , it was a sick hate . I knew better . " " Do you hate me now ? " " Eh ? " Salomon looked at her , in sorrow . " No . You are not only my old friend , who has always been honest and decent under his crusty exterior  - -  whose virtues outweighed his faults . " Salomon managed to smile . " Though sometimes just barely . But also you are the only tie I have left to her . " " Yes . You may find me better-tempered now , Jake . It 's easier to smile , easier to be patient , than it was in that old wreck of a body I had . But , Jake , about Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But could he have arranged it ? " " No . " " You 're certain ? " " Certain . Joha -- Joan , it 's that million dollars that worries you , fear that it might have started a chain of events . When they located Joe Branca , I had to jet there and get that piece of paper . He was dazed . Could n't believe it . But accepted the fact . But not the money . I could n't get him to sign the post-death authorization without first preparing another document , waiving the money . The escrow trustee  --  Chase Manhattan  --  was instructed by Joe to pay it to the Rare Blood Club  --  his idea  --  as a memorial to Eunice Evans Branca . " ( Oh , Boss ! I 'm crying . ) ( We all are . ) ( But , Boss  --  Joe must be starving . ) ( We 'll take care of it . ) She sighed . " I 'll be damned . " " Perhaps . And perhaps myself . But I do n't think Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joan . From a slum family . A flower in the muck . I could n't even get him to accept a lesser sum . He insisted on paying for witnessing and notarizing his mark , and the tax stamp on the assignmentand it took almost every dime he could dig up . He just shook his head and said , Broke do n't scare me . ' " " Jake , we must take care of him . " " I do n't think you can , Joan . In his own odd way he is as proud as she was . But I did one thing . In searching for him I had to get a court order to open their studio  --  indispensable it turned out , as an old letter from his mother gave us the clue that located him . But I learned that the rent was almost due . . . the corporation 's rent agent wanted to know how soon the lease was going to lapse- he assumed that , with her dead , the rent would not be paid . So I covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I bought the lease . As long as Joe chooses to stay , he wo n't be asked for rent . Then I checked around and located her bank account and arranged with a friendly judge to let me guarantee the matter and had it assigned to Joe without bothering him with legal formalities . The little dear was smart about money  --  a nice sum , enough to keep him eating a couple of years , I think . " ( All gone in a couple of months , I think . Boss , Joe does n't understand money . A bank account is n't real , to him . ) ( Do n't worry , darling . Jake and I will handle it . ) She sighed . " I feel reassured , Jake . But distressed about her husband . We must look into it . If he 's that unworldly , then there must be some way to subsidize him without his knowing it . " " All right , Joan , we will try . But Joe Branca taught me  --  at my age ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not if the prospective seller is indifferent to money . " " Will you have more sherry ? And may I have another drop ? If you ca n't stay , I think 1 'll ask to be put to bed and right to sleep . Skip dinner . " " Oh , but you must eat , Joan . For your strength . Look , if I stay , will you eat ? " She gave him Eunice 's best sun-coming-up smile . " Yes ! Yes , Jake dear ! Thank you . " Dinner was informal , service only by Cunningham and two assistants . Joan did her best to simulate a charming , gracious hostess  --  while trying not to appear greedy ; everything tasted so wonderful ! But she waited until coffee had been served and Jake had refused a perfecto and accepted a glass of port , and she then could say , " Thank you , Cunningham , that will be all , " before returning to personal matters . Once they were alone she said , " Jake , when will I be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any time you feel well enough . Are you in a hurry ? " " No . I would be utterly content to be your ward the rest of my life . " Her lawyer smiled slightly . " Joan , by the actuarial tables you now have a life expectancy of about sixty years ; mine is more like ten or twelve . " " Well ... that 's hard to answer . But will you go on as before as my de-facto manager ? Or am t asking too much ? " Salomon studied his glass . " Joan . . . once the court dissolves this guardian-and-ward relationship , there is no reason why you should not manage your affairs . " ( Joan ! Change the subject ; he 's trying to leave us ! ) ( So I know ! Keepp124quiet ! ) ( Tell him your middle name ! ) " Jake . Jake dear . . . look at me . Look hard and keep on looking . That 's better . Jake  --  is it that you would rather not see me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said nothing . She went on , " Is n't it better to get used to what is . . . than to run away from it ? Would n't she  --  Eunice -- want you to stay ? " ( Keep slugging , Sis  --  he wants to stay . ) " It is n't that simple . . . Joan . " " Nothing ever is . But I do n't think you can run away from it any more than I can  --  for I wo n't stop being what I am  --  her body , my mind  --  and you will always know it . All you accomplish by leaving is to deprive me of my one friend and the only man on earth I trust utterly . What does it take to change my name ? " " Eh ? " " Just what I said . I changed my surname from Schmidt ' to Smith ' when I enlisted on December eighth nineteen-forty-one simply by spelling it that way to a recruiting sergeant . No one has bothered me about it since . This time perhaps it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my signature appears . It is technically a sex-change case , is it not ? A court takes judicial notice , or some such , and it 's made a matter of record ? " Salomon slipped into his professional persona and relaxed . " Yes , of course ; I had not thought about that aspect  --  too many other details on my mind . Joan , your earlier name change was legal  --  although informal  --  becauseany person is free to call himself by any name , without permission of a court , as long as there is no criminal intent  --  to defraud , deceive , evade responsibility , avoid taxes , whatever . You can call yourself Joan '  --  or Johann '  --  or Miniver Cheevy '  --  and that is your name , as long as your purpose is innocent . And pronounce it as you like . Knew of a case once of a man who spelled his name Zaustinski ' and pronounced it Jones ' and went to the trouble of publishing the odd pronunciation as a legal notice  --  although he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any fashion its owner chooses . " " Why did he do it , Jake ? " " His grandmother 's will required him to change his name in order to inherit  --  but did not specify how he must pronounce it . Joan , in your case a formal change of name is advisable , but it might be best to wait until you are no longer my ward . But de facto your new name is already what you say it is . " " Then my name is now  --  Joan Eunice Smith . ' " Salomon knocked over his glass of port . He made quite a busyness of mopping it up . Joan said , " Jake , let it be , no importance . I did not meanp125to shock you . But do n't you see the necessity ? It 's a tribute to her , a public acknowledgment of my debt to her . Since I can never pay it , I want to publish it , place it on the wall for all to see , like a Chinese man 's debt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Eunice . . . and only five percent is old Johann now named Joan ' and even that fraction no one can see , only surgeons have seen it . Last but by no means least  --  Jake dear , look at me  --  if you ever forget that fraction and call me Eunice , ' it wo n't matter ; it 's my name . And if you intentionally call me Eunice , ' it will matter , for I shall be pleased and flattered . And any time it suits you to call me Joan Eunice , ' it will make me happy , as I will be certain you have done it intentionally  --  and accepted me as I am . " " Very well . . . Joan Eunice . " She smiled . " Thank you , Jake . I feel happier than I have felt since I first knew . I hope you do . " " Urn . Yes . I think so . It 's a good change  --  Joan Eunice . " " Did you get wine on your clothes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is there any reason for you to go clear out to Safe Harbor tonight ? I 'm sure Cunningham can find you clean socks or whatever . " " Goodness , Joan  --  Joan Eunice  --  I 've been here two nights already . " " Do you think three will wear out your welcome ? You ca n't wear it out . " " And the drive is n't that far , as I placed my house for sale with the enclave trustees months ago . I have rooms at the Gibraltar Club now . Good service , central location , none of the fiddlin ' worries of a house-holder . " " I see your point . Hmm , must remember to resign from the Gib myself . " She smiled . " They 'll never let me past the ladies ' lounge  --  now . " The lawyer said dryly , " I took the liberty of withdrawing you from membership shortly after I became your guardian  --  Joan Eunice . " She laughed in delight . " And me a founding member ! This is delicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . but females are second-class citizens . Jake dear , I 'm going to have to get used to a lot of things . " " I suppose so  --  Joan Eunice . " " So I 'll need you more than ever . Where have you been sleeping ? " " The Brown Room . " " Cunningham must be slipping . He should have put you in the Green Suite . " " Well ... the Green Suite has been used for hospital equipment and supplies . I authorized it . " " Then you can just unauthorize it , as that is your suite . They can storep126that stuff somewhere else . Or remove it , as little of it will be needed from now on . " " Hedrick had most of it removed the middle of the day . " " All right , you stay in the Brown Room tonight ; then tomorrow Cunningham can get the Green Suite in shape for you . " " Joan Eunice , what leads you to think I 'm moving in here ? I 'm not . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Green Suite is yours . Whether you stay a night or a year . Yours without invitation , yours to come and go without bothering to say hello or good-bye . Although I hope it will suit you to say hello to me frequently . Is Hubert , my former valet , still around ? " " Yes . He 's tended me the last two nights . " " From now on he 'll tend the Green Suite and take care of you whenever you honor us with your presence . Jake , you had better move some clothes here . " " Dann it  --  Pardon me , Joan Eunice . " " For saying Damn it ' ? It 's a strange day when my oldest friend must curb his language in my presence . Jake , I 've heard you use language that would blister paint at forty yards  --  and at me , not merely in my presence . " " True . But I must now remember that you are a lady , Joan Eunice . " " Please yourself . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you will have in remembering that I am supposed to be one . If you slip , ignore it  --  for you know that I never took a back seat to any muleskinner in other days . You were saying ? " " Well , I was saying , Damn it , we must remember your reputation '  --  Joan Eunice . " " My what ? My reputation as a woman ? I doubt if I have one -- other than as a sideshow freak . Does n't worry me . " " You 're not in the news , Joan Eunice , since shortly after the operation . Oh , you will be again when we go into court ... and perhaps sooner , when someone in your household staff or Dr. Hedrick 's staff spills the fact of your recovery . " " So I 'll be a sideshow freak again and who cares ? A nine-day wonder lasts only a couple of days now ; they wear out faster than they did when I was a kid . Jake , I have n't worried about what anyone said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our P.R . men built up was for the company , not for me personally . As for Mrs. Grundy  --  I think she 's dead . The present generation does not care about her opinion  --  a change for the better in a world otherwise deteriorating . I doubt if Eunice ever heard of Mrs. Grundy . " ( Sure have , Boss . My fourth-grade teacher . Used to shackp127with the vice-principal until his wife found out . We kids giggled over it - but you would have liked her . . . you dirty old darling . Keep working on Jake , dear  --  time to back away closer . ) ( Who 's driving this car ? ) ( I am . ) Mr. Salomon said thoughtfully , " I think you are right about this younger generation , Joan Eunice . Only people my age and older give such matters a thought . But you know that I should not live under your roof now . And so do I. " " Jake , I am not trying to force you . Nor am I trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your reputation I am thinking of . With your servants , at least . " ( Why , the old hypocrite . Ask him about the time he crowded me into a cloak closet with Cunningham almost breathing down our necks . Go on , I dare you . Oh , he 's a one , that one  --  courage under fire . ) " Jake , that is sweet of you but I do n't give a triple damn how my servants gossip in the kitchen . But I am able to protect you from gossip , sir . I have acquired the most conventional of Victorian chaperonage  --  a respectable lady 's maid . She 'll sleep just through that door , where Hubert used to sleep . If it frets you , she can always be present when you and I are together . " ( Hey , what is this ? Trying to get Winnie into the act ? She might go for it  --  Jake wo n't . Watch it , dear . ) ( Quit kibitzing , Eunice . ) The lawyer raised his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surprising . Though you never were one to dillydally . Or did you shift around part of your in-house staff ? " " Some of both , Jake . I anticipated that Dr. Garcia will insist on my having a trained nurse . . . so I persuaded one of the nurses to stay on , in both capacities . Winnie . You 've seen her , the little redhead . " " Possibly I have . " ( Possibly ' he says . All you men are hypocrites . If he has n't patted her butt , he 's thought about it . ) " I 'm lucky to get her . Intelligent . Educated . Able to teach me things I must know and , being a nurse , used to caring for people even more than a maid does . I used the usual argument  --  money  --  but I was careful to respect her professional pride ; she 'll still be my nurse , she 'll lady's-maid me as a friendly favor . I think she may be in bed . But she would get up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " What ? Oh , do n't be silly , Joan Eunice . You 're making a mountain of a molehill . " " It seemed to me that you were , Jake . I do feel defenseless as a woman ... even though I was far more vulnerable as a sick old man than I am nowp128in this strong young body . But I feel safe with you present  --  and not at all safe when you are away . Jake , I ca n't urge you to live here . . . but ca n't you see what a favor it would be to me ? As well as  --  How many rooms do you have at the Gib ? " " Two . Adequate for my needs . " " The rooms there are n't large . . . whereas the living room of the Green Suite is as large as this room . We could cut a door from it into the upstairs library and it could be your study . Move anything into it you need for my affairs or your own  --  plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't need this big mausoleum any more than you needed your house . But if I tried to sell it , I could n't get ten percent of what it cost ; I built it during the worst of the Riot Years and the cost does n't show ; it 's a prettied-up fortress , stronger than police barracks . Well , we may have such years again ; I may yet be glad I spared no expense . In the meantime it 's big and safe and comfortable , and you might as well use it . When you wish , I mean , especially when you work on my affairs . " " Well , I have been working on some of your affairs here in the house . Uh , Joan Eunice , as your guardian , I had to take over management of your household . " " Has n't Cunningham saved you from such picayune worries ? I must speak to him . " " Well ... yes , he has and I 've let him go on as before ; I 've made no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household books and authorize charges and confound it , they 're stealing you blind . Cunningham especial-1y. , , " Good ! " " What 's good about it ? " " Jake , you told me that it was impossible to spend my income . If my butler is black-marketing two-thirds of what he buys for me and pocketing the proceeds  --  and he always has  --  then he 's anxious to keep his job . Which means that he has to please me . Jake , can you think of a cheaper way to buy the nearest thing to loyalty that can be bought ? Let him steal . Do not bind the mouths of the kine who tread the grain . The good horse must always get his lump of sugar . " " Bad precedent . Corrupts the country . " " The country is corrupt . But it is the only game in town ' ; we have no choice . The problem is always how to live in a decadent society . Jake , I want you to live here . I hope you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe for you to be under the same roof . But do n't worry about my reputation  --  and Winnie is here to protect yours . Most certainly do n't thinkp129about such trivia as household expenses ; just close your eyes and sign . But do n't hesitate to chew out Cunningham if the service is less than perfect ; that 's the price he must pay for the privilege of swindling me . By the way , my chief guard steals , too ; I think he has a fifty-fifty split with Cunningham . I 've never tried to find out the arrangement ; it would rinharrass them . " Salomon smiled . " Joan Eunice , for a young  --  and beautiful  --  woman , you sound remarkably Iike a cynical old man I used to know . " " Do 1 , Jake dear ? I must learn not to sound that way . I must now leave the ' cynical old man ' things to you and try to behave like a lady . If I can . But please do n't disrupt a smooth household by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a reform administration : less efficient and still more expensive . Did n't your servants steal from you ? " The lawyer looked sheepish . " Well ... yes . But I had the best cook in Sate Harbor enclave . If I had fired her , I might have wound up with one just as expensive  --  who put sugar in gravy . I think I was groused that they were stealing from you -- when you were helpless . But I did n't want to tamper with your household while there was any chance that you might recover . Wanted to hand it back as it was . And I have . Or shall . " " Thank you , Jake . At the moment , while I may not yet be a lady , I feel not at all like a cynical old man . I find that I feel like a woman who has been ill and is not yet fully recovered . I had best go to bed . Will you help Inc ? " " IJI , I 'll call the nurse . " " Jake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must quit being jumpy about it . there , lend me your arm . I can stand if you 'll help me ... and walk to the bed if you 'll let me lean on you . " Salomon gave up , offered her both hands to help her out of the chair , steadied her with his arm to the bed . Joan Eunice got into it quickly , slid hri negligee off as she slid under the sheet . " Thank you , Jake . " " My pleasure  --  Joan Eunice . " " Will you have breakfast with me ? Or lunch if you want to sleep late ? " " I Ili ... lunch . " " in looking forward to it . " She put out her hand . He took it , bowed over ithesitated only slightly and kissed it firmly . Joan Eunice kept his hand and pulled . " Come closer , Jake dear . " She leached up , took his face between her palms . " You loved her . " .. Yes . ' " I loved her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my name . My new name . " " Joan  --  Joan Eunice . " " Thank you , Jake . " Unhurriedly , she pulled his face down , kissed him softly on the lips . " Good night , dear friend . " " Good night  --  Joan Eunice . " He left quickly . ( Joan you bitch , you 're pushing him too hard . ) ( I am not ! ) ( The hell you are n't . For a second I thought you were going to drag him right into bed . ) ( Ridiculous ! ) ( And you 're pushing yourself too hard , too . ) ( Eunice , quit crabbing . I could have backed out up to the last split second . I found that I did not mind it . After all , there are many cultures in which men kiss men , as a gesture of friendship . ) ( In case you have n't noticed , you are no longer a man  --  you 're a mixed-up chick . ) ( I 've noticed . Look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show Jake that he could touch me , even kiss me good-night . . . and not have it be tragic . And it was n't . Reminded me of my father kissing me good-night . . . which he did until I was a big boy . ) ( Well . . . perhaps Jake is going to settle for being fatherly . But do n't count on it , Joan . Let me warn you , Sis  --  Jake can kiss much better than that . He can kiss so well that your insides melt down , starting at your belly button and spreading in all directions . ) ( A possibility . A remote one . Now will you shut up , and let us sleep ? I really am tired . ) ( Love me , Boss ? ) ( I 've never stopped loving you dear  --  and never will . ) ( Me , too  - -  and wish I could kiss you good-night . Sleep , Boss  --  everything 's going to be all right . ) Before she could get to sleep , Winifred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joan ? " she said softly . " Yes , dear ? Put the floor lights on . " " Mr. Salomon said that you had gone to bed  --  " " And you look as if you had . Did he wake you ? " " Oh , no . I was chatting with Mrs. Sloan ; she 's on watch . But Dr. Garcia left word that your bed was to be all the way down  --  and I see that it is n't . How do I put it down ? " " I do it myself , right from the bed  --  down , like that  --  or back up , like that . I was n't asleep yet . It 's all right , 1 ' 11 put it all the way down before you leave . . . and you can tell Doctor that I was a good girl . " " Fine ! You can have this capsule if you want it . You do n't have to take it , Mrs. Sloan says that Doctor says . " " I 'll take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll hand me the water there ... and kiss me good-night . If you wo n't , I 'll sulk and ring for Mrs. Sloan and ask her to kiss me good-night . " The little nurse grinned . " 1 ' 11 force myself . "  |p131Winifred  left about sixty seconds later . ( Well , Eunice ? How did that one stack up ? ) ( Quite well , Butch . Say eighty percent as well as Jake can do . ) ( You 're teasing . ) ( You 'll find out . Winnie is sweet  --  but Jake has had years more practice . I 'm not chucking asparagus at Winnie . I thought you were going to drag her right in with us . ) ( With Mrs. Sloan outside and watching our heart rate ? What do you think I am ?

Tell me , hon  --  have you been fretting about those negative reports ? ) ( No , you have been fretting ; they were what I expected .

Joan Eunice , we agreed that it was not smart to go into court until you were discharged as well in all respects . He thinks it may be possible , now . " " Oh . Oh ! How about that platoon of psychiatrists ? " " We 'll have them . We may never need them . But we 'll be ready to offset their expert witnesses . You will have to put up with long and searching interviews ; our own experts must go into court prepared . " ( Prepared to justify their fancy fees .

G-Y-N ? " " Not unless you ask for it . Trouble ? " " Not a bit . I feel healthy enough to whup a grizzly bear . " " And you check out that healthy , too . Nevertheless your case worries me . " " Why , Doctor ? " " Because your case is unique . I know almost as little about it as you do . Joan , when you left this house  --  as Mr. Smith  --  I never expected to see you alive again . When you were brought back , I did not expect you to regain consciousness . When you regained consciousness , I felt sorry for you . . . as I never expected you to be other than paralyzed from the neck down . Yet here you are , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Doctor ? " " I do n't know . We know little enough about any transplant  --  and nothing about a brain transplant other than what we have learned from you . Joan , for the past two weeks there has been no reason  --  other than caution  --  why you needed more supervision than any other young woman in good health . Say Winifred here , for example . " He shrugged . " Of the two you seem to be somewhat more ruggedly healthy than she is . Nevertheless I would bet that Winifred , barring accidents , will live out her normal span . . . whereas you do n't fit any curve ; you 're unique . Please , I 'm not trying to frighten you , but only a fool makes predictions based on ignorance ; I am not that sort of fool . " " Doctor , " she answered calmly , " you 're saying that this body could reject the brain  --  or vice versa , it 's the same thing . Or that I could drop dead , heart failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read a great deal onp137transplants , while I was still Johann Smith . I am not afraid . If it happens  --  well , I 've had a wonderful vacation from old age , with its pain and boredom . " She smiled happily . " It 's been like dying and going to Heaven  --  and even a few weeks of Heaven can be eternity . " " I 'm glad you accept it so philosophically . " " Not philosophically , ' Doctor . With wonder and joy and reaching out greedily for every golden second ! " " Well ... I 'm pleased that Winifred is going to stay with you and I hope that you will keep her a long time  --  " " As long as she will stay ! Always , I hope . " "  --  because , otherwise , I would worry . But Winnie can do in an emergencyanything I could do , and she 'll have everything here with which to do it  --  and she knows and I want you to know that I will get here fast if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let 's get that transmitter off you ; you wo n't be monitored any longer .

" Slight erythema , and a faint circle of mechanical dermatitis . With your amazing repair factor I 'm betting you wo n't be able to find where it 's been by tomorrow . But I 'm going to miss my morning movie . " " Sir ? " " I do n't suppose anyone has told you but I have watched the monitors every morning , while you exercised . . . waiting for your heart to pound . Or your respiration to warn me . Nothing . Never anything abnormal , I mean ; I could tell that you were exercising . Very mild exercise , I concluded . " " Why , yes , I suppose so . Yoga . " " Well ! I would not class yoga as mild . ' If we mean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a hundred-yard dash , or weight lifting . But I  --  well , both of us  --  have been doing the classic poses .

" " Doctor , I have n't been building muscles for show ; I am simply trying to get perfect control over my new  --  wonderful !  --  body . Here , let me show you . " Joan stood up , letting the negligee fall , stood on the floor six inches from the exercise mat  --  shifted her weight onto her left foot , brought her right leg up behind her in perfect extension while she leaned slowlyp138forward . . . deep . . . deeper . . . until she clasped her left ankle with both hands and pressed her cheek against her shin , with her right leg arrow straight above her in a perfect split .

But , if Winnie did n't teach you , where did you learn it , Joan ? " ( Oh , oh ! Watch it , Boss  --  he smells a mouse . ) " How old are you , Doctor ? " " Eh ? Thirty-seven . " " I learned it about forty years before you were born . But did n't have time to keep it up , " she went on . " Then for many years did n't have the physique even to try .

" She took it and held it , instead of presenting her back for him to put it on her . " Doctor , Mr. Salomon will be settling your fees and expenses . But , to show my great appreciation , I want to add something . "  |p139He  shook his head . " A doctor should not accept more than his fee .. . and , I assure you , mine are high .

He hesitated about one heartbeat , then put his arms around her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came open , and she flowed more closely against him . ( Do n't faint ! Let 's not miss any of this . ) ( Do n't bother me , Eunice ; I'mbusy ! ) The Doctor broke from it , caught his breath , and looked at her soberly . Then he reached down , recovered her robe and held it . Joan let him put it on her , then said , " Thank you , Doctor . " She turned and smiled . " Urn . I think I can honestly report that you are in excellent physical condition . Mr. Salomon is waiting . " " Please tell him I 'll be out in a moment . " Joan waited until the door closed . Then she went into Winifred 's arms and giggled against her shoulder . " Winnie , did you turn your back ? Did n't you peek a little ? I hope . " " I turned my back .

I have no way to judge . Dear darling Jake kisses me ; you 've seen him -- but just uncle ' sort of pecks . And you kiss me  --  and yours are n't pecks . But you 're a girl and smaller than I am . Doctor is the first man who has really kissed me . . . and it made me feel so little and helpless that 1 darn near dragged him down onto the mat . You 've never kissed him ? " " Him ? Joan honey , if I told any of the nurses about this , I would not be believed . Dr. Garcia does n't even pat bottoms ; he just growls . " " He patted my bottom . 1 think he did . Things were fuzzy right then . " " I know he did . I saw it and did n't believe it . Joan ? You would n't have made me skin down . Would you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you 're a patient .

"  | " I told him to come back in two weeks and you 'd be able to . Shall I remind him ? " " Oh , Joan ! You 're teasing me again . " The redhead added thoughtfully , " Do you really think I could , by myself , in only two more weeks ? " " I know you can . But not in clothes , not even tights . So if you are going to blush and go chicken , I had better not remind dear Doctor . " " Uh . . . that did look like quite a kiss . But Paul would n't like it . " " Would n't like what ?

Asyou pointed out , sex is not a sport , it 's for being happy . ) " Uh . .. Doctor would n't kiss me , anyway . He does n't even know I 'm female . " " Never believe it . You are and he 's not stupid . He 'll kiss you if I suggest that it 's the applause expected for a perfect performance .

Counsel , are you suggesting that Miss Smith  --  this young lady at whom I am pointing  --  is not Johann Sebastian Bach Smith ? " " Counsel suggests nothing , Your Honor . I merely note that we have nothing in the record to show that the person at whom the Court pointed is Johann Sebastian Bach Smith  --  and that the question of competency can not be considered until proof of identity is indubitably established . " " Is Counsel attempting to instruct this Court in the law ? " " Oh , not at all ! " " It sounded like that . May I remind Counsel that this Court sits today in equity , not in law  --  and that the procedures are what the Court says they are . " Most certainly , Your Honor . I regret if I inadvertently sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from contempt , and do n't let it happen again . " " Yes , Your Honor . " as I am sick and tired of the behavior of about fifty percent of the spectators and at least ninety percent of the press , I order the Bailiff to clear the room .

Jake , every rich man wants to hear his will read  --  and I may get the chance . " " Hmm .

" " It 's there . If you 're not Johann , then you have to be Eunice . It 's an either-or ' " ( Nope ! It 's both . ) ( Eunice , this is going to be fun ! ) ( I think so , too , Boss . ) The part of his chambers selected by Judge McCampbell was a comfortablelounge . Once in it he looked around .

Oh , not at all , Judge . " " Good . Because we 're going to cut through the fog on this silly business . Who needs a fog cutter ? " The Judge stepped to a corner bar . " Alec ?

And how about your sister ? And your cousins ? Miss Smith ? I recall what you used to order at the Gib some years back . Are your tastes the same now ? " ( Watch it , Boss ! It 's loaded . ) ( Relax , Eunice . ) " Judge , with a new body my tastes have changed in some respects . But I remember fondly Glenp143Grant on the rocks  --  back before my doctors put a stop to it . But I have n't tasted anything with that much authority since those days , and , since this is a competency hearing , I 'll settle for coffee . Or a Coke , if you can twist its tail for that . " The Judge rubbed his nose and looked thoughtful . " I 'm not sure it 's a competency hearing until we settle this matter of identity . Jake could have told you about Glen Grant . The idea of Johann Smith ordering a Coke shakes me . " Joan smiled at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My doctors made me quit carbonated drinks long before they made me give up whisky . Back about the time you entered law school . If I 'm Johann Smith , that is . If I 'm not , I 'll ask to be excused  --  as in that case I 'm not a ward of the Court and should n't be here . Is n't that correct ? " McCampbell looked still more thoughtful . " Jake , do you want to caution your client ' ? No , not your client , ' your  --  no , not that either . Blessed if I know what you are ; that 's what we 've got to find out . Young lady , sit down and I 'll fetch you a Coke . Alec , get drink orders from your four ladies and serve them .

Alec , confound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this young lady ? " " Well  --  Judge , are you going to talk about contempt if I suggest that your question is not properly put ? " McCampbell sighed . " Young lady , pay no attention to him . He was my roommate in college and gives me a bad time whenever he comes into my court . Someday I 'm going to give him thirty days to think it over  --  and about four-thirty tomorrow morning I 'm going to trip him into some very cold water . Accidentally . " " Do that , Mac , and I 'll sue . In Canada . " " I know he was your roommate , Judge ; you were both Big Greens '  --  Dartmouth seventy-eight , was it not ' ? Why not let him ask me questions and find out for himself who I am ? " Mrs. Seward said shrilly , " That 's not the way to go about it ! First you must take the fingerprints of that -- -that impostor  --  and  --  " " Mrs. Seward ! " " Yes , Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shut up ! " Mrs. Seward shut up . Judge McCampbell went on , " Madam , simply because it suits me to be informal in my chambers do not think that this isp144not a court in session or that I would not find you in contempt . I would enjoy it . Alec , you had better convince her of that . " " Yes , Your Honor . Mrs. Seward , any suggestions you have , you will make through me , not to the Court . " " But I was just going to say that  --  " " Mrs. Seward , keep quiet ! You 're here only by courtesy of the Court until this matter of identity is cleared up . I 'm sorry , Judge . I advised my clients that , at the most , this was a holding action . I know that Jake Salomon would not risk bringing a ringer  --  sorry , Miss Smith  --  a ringer into court . " " And I know it . " " But they insisted . If Mrs. Seward wo n't control herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case . " The Judge shook his head and grinned . " No , sirree , Alec . You fetched them here , you 're stuck with them  --  at least until Court adjourns . Jake ? Is Ned still fronting for you ? Or will you speak for yourself ? " " Oh , I think we can both speak up from time to time , without friction . " " Ned ? " " Of course , Judge . Jake can speak for himself and should . But I 'm finding it interesting . Novel situation . " " Quite . Well , speak up if you have anything to contribute . Alec , I do n't think we can get anywhere today . Do you ? " Alec Train stood mute . Joan said , " Why not , Judge ? I 'm here , I 'm ready . Ask me anything . Bring out the rack and the thumbscrews  --  I ' 11 talk . " The Judge again rubbed his nose . " Miss Smith , I sometimes think that my predecessors were overly hasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can settle to my own satisfaction whether or not you are the person known as Johann Sebastian Bach Smith , of this city and of Smith Enterprises , Limited . But it is not that simple . In an ordinary identity case Mrs. Seward 's suggestion of fingerprints would be practical . But not in this case . Alec ? Do Petitioners stipulate that the brain of their grandfather was transplanted into another body ? " Petitioners ' counsel looked unhappy . " May it please the Court , I am under instructions not to stipulate anything of the sort . " " So ? What 's your theory ? " " Uh , Missing and presumed dead , ' I suppose . We take the position that the burden of proof is on anyone who steps forward and claims to be Johann Sebastian Bach Smith . " " Jake ? "  | " I ca n't agree as to the burden of proof , Judge . But my client  --  my ward who is also my client , Johann Sebastian Bach Smith  --  is present in court and I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named individual . Both of us are ready to be questioned by the Court in any fashion in order to assure the Court as to her identity . I was about to say that both of us are willing to be questioned by anyone  --  but on second thought I can not concede that there is any interested party other than my client . " " Judge ? " " Yes , Miss Smith ? Jake , do you want her to speak ? " " Oh , certainly . Anything . " " Go ahead , Miss Smith . " " Thank you . Judge , my granddaughters can ask me anything . I 've known them since they were babies ; if they try to trip me , I 'll have them hanging on the ropes in two minutes . For example , Johanna  --  the one you called Mrs. Seward '  - -  was hard to housebreak . On her eighth birthday  --  May fifteenth nineteen-sixty , the day the Paris Conference between Eisenhower and Khrushchev broke down  --  her mother , my daughter Evelyn , invited me over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evelyn shoved Johanna into my lap and she cut loose  --  " " I did no such thing ! " " Oh , yes , you did , Johanna . Evelyn snatched you off my lap and apologized and said that you had a bed-wetting problem . Ca n't say as to that  --  my daughter lied easily . " " Judge , are you going to sit there and let that  --  that person  --  insult the memory of my dead mother ? " " Mrs. Seward , your counsel cautioned you . If you do n't heed his caution , this Court is capable of nailing you into a barrel and letting you speak only when I say to pull out the bung . Or some such . Squelch her , Alec . Suppress her the way they did in the trial in Alice in Wonderland '  --  which this is beginning to resemble . She 's not a party to this ; she is here only to give evidence in case the Court needs it . Miss Smith  --  " " Yes , sir ? " " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not evidential . Can you think of anything that Johann Smith would know and that I would know or could check on -- but which Jake Salomon could not possibly have briefed you on ? " " That 's a tough one , Your Honor . " " So it is . But the alternative  --  today  --  is for me to assume that you are an impostor most carefully coached and then to question you endlessly in anp146attempt to trip you . I do n't want to do that . . . because final identification  --  now that the matter has been raised  --  will have to be by evidence as conclusive as fingerprints . You see that , do n't you ? " " Yes , I see it but I do n't quite see how . " She smiled and spread her graceful hands . " My fingerprints  --  and everything about me that can be seen  --  are those of my donor . " " Yes , yes , surely  --  but there are more ways of killing a cat than buttering it with parsnips . Later . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Judge , in the interests of my client I can not concede that physical means of identifying this body are relevant . The question is : Is this the individual designated by Social Security number 551-20-0052 and known to the world as Johann Sebastian Bach Smith ? I suggest that Estate of Henry M. Parsons v. Rhode Island , ' while not on all fours , is relevant . " McCampbell said mildly , " Jake , you are much older than I am and I 'm reasonably sure you know the law more thoroughly than I do . Nevertheless , here today , I am the Judge . " " Certainly , Your Honor ! May it please the Court , I  --  " " So quit being so damned respectful in my chambers . You sat on my orals and voted to pass me , so you must think I know some law . Of course the Parsons case is relevant ; we 'll get to it later . In the meantime I 'm trying to find a basis for a pro-tern ruling . Well , Miss Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm identified or not . In the words of a gallant gentleman : Broke do n't scare me . ' " She suddenly chuckled and glanced at her granddaughters . " May I tell you something funny  --  private-ly ? , " Mmm ... I could clear the room of everyone but you and your counsel ; nevertheless you had better save any jokes until after we adjourn . " " Yes , sir . May I address one irrelevant remark to my granddaughters ? " " Hmmph . I may strike it from the record . Go ahead . " " Thank you , Judge . Girls -- Johanna , Marla , June , Elinor  --  look at me . For thirty-odd years you have been waiting for me to die . Now you hope to prove that I am dead , else this silly business would never have come up . Girls , I hope you get away with it ... for I ca n't wait to see your faces when my will is read . " ( You zapped ' em , Boss ! Look at those expressions ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ; we 're not home free . ) " Your Honor  --  " " Yes , Alec ? "  | " May I suggest that this is not relevant ? " Joan cut in . " Rut I said it would be irrelevant , Mr. Train . Just the same , they had better start thinking about how to break my will , instead of this nonsense . " She added thoughtfully , " Perhaps I had better set up alifetime trust that will make them slightly better off with me alive than dead . . . to protect myself against patricidal assassination . Judge , is ' patricidal ' the right word ? Now that I 'm female ? " " Blessed if I know . Better make it avicidal '  --  no , avicide ' already means the killing of birds and has nothing to do with avus . ' Never mind , Miss Smith , take up such matters with your attorney and let us return to our muttons . Have you thought of anything which Jake Salomon could not have coached you on ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for most of a generation . Mmm , Judge , will you shake hands with me ? " " Eh ? " " We had best do it under the table , or out of sight of anyone but Mr. Train . " Looking puzzled , the Judge went along with her request . Then he said , " Be damned ! Excuse me . Miss Smith  --  shake hands with Alec . " Joan did so , letting her body cover it from spectators . Mr. Train looked surprised , whispered something to her which she answered in a whisper . ( Boss , what was what ? ) ( Greek . Tell you later , dear  --  though girls are n't supposed to know . ) McCampbell said , " Mr. Salomon could not have coached you ? " " Ask him . Jake was a Barb , not a Greek . " " Of course I was a Barb , " Salomon growled . " I had no stomach for being the exhibit Jew in a chapter that did not want its charter lifted . What is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Miss Smith is a fraternity brother of the Judge and myself . Mmm . . . sister , ' I suppose . Judge , it 's easy to check this on both Johann Smith and Mr. Salomon . In the meantime I find it persuasive . " " Perhaps I can add to it , " Joan said . " Mr. Train  --  Brother Alec  --  of course you should check on both Jake and myself . But look me up in our fraternal archives under Schmidt ' rather than Smith ' as I changed my name in forty-one . Which my granddaughters know . But you both know of our fraternal Distress Fund ? " " Yes . " " Certainly , Miss Smith . "  | " The fund did not exist when I was pledged  --  my senior year it was , after I made Phi Beta Kappa and because our local chapter needed a greasy grind and had an alumnus willing to pay for my initiation . The fund was started during World War Two ; I helped augment it some years later and was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I dropped most outside activities . Judge , you tapped the fund for fifteen hundred in the spring of seventy-eight . " " Eh ? So I did . But I paid it back , eventually  --  then donated the same amount at a later time , according to our customs . " " I 'm glad to hear it . The latter , I mean ; you were off the hook before I resigned as a trustee . I was a hard-nosed trustee , Judge , and never okayed a loan until I was certain that it was a distress case and not just a convenience to a lazy undergraduate . Shall I relate the circumstances which caused me to okay your loan ? " The Judge blinked . " I would rather you did not , at least not now . Alec knows them . " " Yes , " agreed Train . " Would have lent him the money myself if I had had it . " ( What is this , Boss ? ) ( Case of rheumatic fever , ' sweet . ) ( Abortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl  --  and here I am digging up the skeleton . ) ( Bitch . ) ( No , Eunice  --  my granddaughters do n't know what I 'm talking about , nor does Jake . ) " I see no reason to discuss it , " Miss Smith went on , " unless the Judge wants to question me privately  --  and if you do , Judge , do remind me to tell you a real giggle about the ancestries of my so loving granddaughters . Odd things happen even in the best families  --  and the Schmidt family was never one of the best . We 're a vulgar lot , me and my descendants  --  our only claim to prominence is too much money . " " Later perhaps , Miss Smith . I am now ready to hand down a decision- - temporary and conservative . Counsels ? " " Ready , Judge . " " Nothing to add , Your Honor . " McCampbell fitted his fingertips together . " Identity . It need not depend on fingerprints or retinal patterns or similar customary evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have both eyes gouged out , be so scarred and damaged that even his dentist could not identify him  --  and he would still be John Doe , with the same Social Security number . Something like that happened to you , Miss Smith , assuming that you are indeed Johann Sebastian Bach Smith  --  though I am happy to see "  --  he smiled  --  " that no scars show.  | " This Court finds persuasive the evidence of your identity brought out in this hearing . We assume , pro tern , that you are Johann Sebastian Bach Smith . " However "  --  the Judge looked at Salomon  --  " we now get to the Parsons case . Inasmuch as the Supreme Court has ruled that the question of life or death resides in the brain and nowhere else , this Court now rules that identity must therefore reside in the brain and nowhere else . In the past it has never been necessary to decide this point ; now it is necessary . We find that to rule in any other fashion would be inconsistent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Parsons v. Rhode Island . ' To rule in any other way would create chaos in future cases in any way similar to this one : Identity must lie in the brain . " Now , Jake , I am in effect going to shove the burden of the proof over onto you and your client . At a later time you must be prepared to prove beyond any possible doubt that Johann Sebastian Bach Smith 's brain was removed from his body and transplanted into this body "  --  McCampbell pointed . Jake nodded . " I realize that , Judge . A person who wants to cash a check must prove his identity  --  this is on all fours . But today we were taken by surprise . " " So was the Court  --  and , Alec , I 'm going to take you by surprise someday . . . with something better than a pie bed or an exploding cigar . Damn it , you should have warned Court and Counsel . " " I apologize , Your Honor . I received my instructions quite late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a continuance , not let this hearing open . You know better . Never mind , the hearing has been instructive . Miss Smith  --  Miss Johann Sebastian Bach Smith subject to remarks above  --  you were made a ward of this Court and placed under the guardianship of Mr. Jacob Salomon for one reason alone : You were at the time not competent to manage your affairs by reason of post-operative incapacity . Let the record show that neither insanity in the legal sense nor mental illness in the medical sense had anything to do with it ; you were in an extended condition of unconsciousness following surgery and that was all . You are no longer unconscious , you appear to be in good health , and the Court takes judicial notice that during this hearing you appeared always to be alert and clearheaded . Since the sole condition  --  unconsciousness  --  on which you were made a ward no longer obtains , you are now no longer a ward and Mr. Salomon is discharged of his guardianship  --  what 's the trouble , Alec ? "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Petitioners I must ask to have an objection entered into the record . " " On what grounds ? " " Why , lack of expert witnesses as to , uh , Miss Smith 's ' competence . " " Do you have expert witnesses ready to examine her ? " " Of course . " " Jake ? " " Certainly . Waiting on call . " " How many ? " " Harrumph ! One more than Alec has , however many he qualifies . " " So I expected , and if we start qualifying expert witnesses now and let each one exercise his little ego , those fish in Nova Scotia would die of old age . Keep your shirt on , Alec . No expert witnesses were used to show this person 's incompetence ; the gross condition of unconsciousness was stipulated  --  andnow no longer exists . Alec , Your objection goes into the record but Iam putting you on notice that your claim of need for expert witnesses lacks foundation  --  and this time the burden of proof is on you. 11 Petitioners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get their hands on the large sums of money at stake in this matter . Every citizen , every person , is conditionally presumed to be competent  --  and that means everyone  --  you , me , Jake , Miss Smith , Petitioners , and the illiterate who fills that bar and cleans out the empties . This Court will not set the extremely bad precedent of allowing you , or anyone , to conduct a fishing expedition into the matter of a person 's competency without proper foundation . However  --  Jake . " " Yes , Judge . " " We all know what this hearing is really about . Money . Lots of money . You might explain to Miss Smith that her competence may be challenged at some later time . " " We 're prepared for it . " " While I 've discharged you as her guardian , you will stay on as conservator of the property of Johann Sebastian Bach Smith pending positive proof of identity  --  and I do mean positive ; you 've got to trace Smith 's brain into this body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that surgeon ? Boyle ? I suppose you 'll need him . And several others . I 'm not going to take anything for granted , nor permit any stipulations ; there is too much at stake and I do n't intend to be reversed . Alec , if you are going to challenge competency , you will have to wait until after that time and  --  if it 's in my court  --  show foundation for such challenge . That satisfy you ? "  | " I guess it will have to . " " I guess so , too . Court 's adjourned . " Mrs. Seward stood up , red-faced , and said to Alec Train , " You ' re fired ! " M cCampbell said coldly , " Madam , consider yourself lucky that you waved that outburst until after Court adjourned . Now , get out of my chambers . You other three ladies may leave , too . " Johanna 's sister June said as she stood up : " Judge , may I ask a question ? " " Certainly , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that 's all right , I 'm not criticizing . But are you leaving her in our grandfather 's house ? I think you ought to know Iha t it is loaded , simply loaded , with valuable works of art . What is to keep her from gutting it while we are proving that she ca n't be our grandfather ? " " Oh . Madam , Mr. Salomon knows the duties and responsibilities of a conservator . However  --  Jake , it would be prudent not to permit any objects of sentimental or artistic value to leave that house during this waiting period . " " No problem . Since I 've had to manage the household , I 've been staying there much of the time . But I 'll have a word with Johann 's chief guard . " " Judge , may I say something ? " " Certainly , my  --  Miss Smith . " " I 'd like protection against them . June does n't know what objets d'art I own . Not one of them has been inside my house since it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them called on me or sent flowers or anything . And the same for my post-surgery convalescence  --  except that I learned that Johanna  --  Mrs. Seward  --  tried to crash in right after my operation . I do n't trust them ; I 'd like the Court 's protection . " Jake ? ' " I was n't there but I heard it from Johann 's chief guard . " " Mrs. Seward ? " She sniffed . " I had a perfect right ! Next of kin . " " I think I understand it . All right , you four ladies  --  listen carefully , then leave . You will refrain from visiting the home or offices or other properties of Johann Sebastian Bach Smith . You will refrain from making any attempt to see or to speak with this young lady I have been addressing as ' Miss Smith . ' If you need to communicate with her or with the Court 's appointed conservator , Mr. Salomon , you will do so only through this Court or through your attorney , whoever he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith . This is an order to all four of you and each ofp152you will obey under pain of severe penalties for contempt . Do you understand ? Are there any questions ? " McCampbell waited , then went on , " Very well . Now all four of you leave . " The Judge remained standing while they filed out . When the door sealed , he sighed . " Whew ! Miss Smith  --  or should I say Brother Schmidt ' ?  --  will you have that Glen Grant on rocks now ? Glenlivet actually , I do n't have Glen Grant . " She smiled . " Truly , I have n't tried anything that potent on this new body . Jake and I should leave  --  you and Brother Alec have a date with a fish . " " Oh , do sit down . Alec has his gear in his car in the basement and my copter is picking us up from the roof in about an hour . Another Coke ? " " Is there sherry ? I get a very pleasant buzz on just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not drink at all . " ( Almost never , Boss  --  and you 're giving me a taste for the stuff . ) ( Quiet , darling  --  later . ) ( All right .. . but ask him about our name . Is n't Judgie Wudgie a darling ? Wonder what he 's like in bed ? ) ( You and your one-track mind ! I 'll ask him about our name . Now shut up ! ) " Sherry it shall be . Jake ? Ned ? Alec ? " " Judge , since Jake does n't need me , I 'll ask to be excused . " " Okay , Ned . Alec , serve yourself and take care of Jake ; I want to stare at Brother Schmidt . I probably wo n't be seeing you again , Miss Smith . Your granddaughters are almost certain to try to move it into a higher court . That business of proving who you are by our fraternity grip  --  that tore it . All I could do today was to give you a little protection in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here 's an odd thing about this sex change . When I was an old man , frail and helpless , I was afraid of nothing . Now I 'm young and healthy and strong . But female . To my surprise I find that I want to be protected . " Alec Train said over his shoulder from the bar , " I 'll protect you , Brother Schmidt ! Do n't trust Brother McCampbell  --  he was the worst wolf in our chapter . Step aside , Brother Wolf  --  it 's my turn to stare at our new brother . " " Boys , I am not a new brother , ' I was pledged years before you were born . But I 'm not surprised that you like to stare at me , as my donor  --  Jake , do they know ? " " It 's not much of a secret , Johann . Judge McCampbell knows , I think Alec knows , too . " ( Joan , if he does n't know , tell him . And do n't forget our name ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ? )  | " All right . My donor , Eunice Branca , my former secretary and the sweetest , loveliest girl I 've never known , was not only a perfect secretary ; she was a beauty contest winner not many years back . I know what a treasure I inherited from her . I do n't wear her body with the charming grace she gave it  --  but I 'm trying to learn . " ( You 're learning , Boss . ) " It is the opinion of this Court that you have learned . " " Shut up , Mac . Brother Schmidt , I agree with him merely because he 's right . " " Thank you both  --  on behalf of Eunice Branca . Jake ? Now that Court has adjourned do I have to wear this Mother Hubbard ? It 's too warm . " " That 's up to you . I suppose it depends on how much you have under it . " " Mmm . . . perhaps I 'd better not . Minimum decency under the customs of today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back when I was a youngster . " ( Exhibitionist . You 're asking to be coaxed . ) ( Certainly . And who taught me ? At least the bra is n't just paint , like that mermaid outfit you zapped me with . ) Alec Train said , " Brother Schmidt , in identity cases it is sometimes necessary to require the challenged individual to strip completely . Birthmarksand scars and such  --  tell her , Judge . " " Ignore him , Brother Schmidt . I would n't call that lovely Grecian robe a Mother Hubbard . ' But I can see that it was intended for outdoors and I 'll happily hang it up for you . " " Uh . . . oh , goodness , I 'm having trouble shucking off my **33;11297;TOOLONG . Jake has seen me in the nothing-much girls wear today , and he 's seen Eunice in even less than I have on under this ; Eunice was n't shy about sharing her beauty . " ( You milked that , did n't you , dearie ? Which one are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a finger down the magnostrip , let the robe fall open ; Alec Train hurried to claim it ahead of the Judge . Then she posed . " See ? This is almost the way Eunice Branca looked  --  except that she walked in glory , always . . . while I am an old man who is trying to learn to wear her body . " Besides Eunice 's body , Joan was wearing some of Winnie 's clothes  --  black frill skirt , translucent black Cling-On cups , six-inch Sticktite stilt sandals that left her pretty feet in view  --  no paint , just restrained enhancement with rouge and shadow . She posed , they stared . Jake cleared his throat louder than usual . " Joan , had I known what you were wearing  --  not wearing , rather  --  under that robe , I would have advised you to keep it on . " " Oh , pooh , Jake , you would n't have scolded Eunice for dressing thisp154way . But that brings up something I must ask . Judge , I ca n't go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my name ? " " That 's not properly put , Brother Schmidt . You can have any name you like . At most a court confirms it . You mean that you need a girl 's name now . Helen , perhaps ? Or Cleopatra ? " " Thank you  --  for Eunice . " ( Boss , find out if Judge is still married . ) ( Go back to sleep ! ) " Not either of those names . I want to be known as Joan '  --  for Johann '  --  Joan . . . Eunice . . . Smith . ' " Judge McCampbell looked surprised , then smiled in approval . " A good choice . The flavor of your masculine name , plus , I assume , a tribute to your donor . But may I offer a word of advice ? You can start calling yourself that today  --  " " I already have . " " I noticed that Jake called you Joan . ' But let it be a family name , and keep your masculine name at other times  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth -- -until your identity has been finally established  --  in the Supreme Court if possible . Do n't cloud the issue . " " I gave her the same advice , " Salomon put in . " I 'm not surprised . Miss  --  Brother Schmidt , what do you want me to call you ? In private . " " Why , either Joan ' or Eunice . ' Both by preference , as I do not want anyone ever to forget Eunice Branca . Me least of all  --  I want to be reminded of my benefactor . Benefactrix . But do n't call me Miss ' in private . Look , brothers , as Brother Schmidt ' I am half a century older than you two . . . but as Joan Eunice ' I am only a few weeks old . However , Eunice 's body is that of a young woman , and that is what I am learning  --  must learn !  --  to be . You could have daughters my age . So please call me Joan Eunice ' and save Miss Smith ' for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schmidt ' if you wish  --  although Yonny ' was what I was called by our brothers in my chapter . " Alec said , " Joan Eunice Brother Yonny Schmidt , I 'm pleased to call you whatever you like , and I do n't have daughters your age and you make me feel younger just to look at you . But I 'm not speaking for my roommate and I 'd hate to tell you how old some of his offspring are ; he was the scourge of P.S. 238  --  stay away from him and let me protect you . And did I mention how happy I am that Mrs. Seward fired me ? Brother Joan Eunice , I would never have been in this case other than as a favor to Parkinson 's mother-in-law . But at first it did look like a straightforward case of protecting the interests of an invalid too ill to protect himself . Believe me. "  | " Do n't listen to him , " advised the Judge . " He 's an ambulance chaser . I throw legitimate business his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But back to this matter of identity . Joan Eunice , I do n't know how much law you know  --  " " Just what has rubbed off in the course of a long and evil life . I depend on experts . Such as Jake . " " I see . Well , your granddaughters probably think it is wrong of me to help you establish your identity . It is not . True , in a civil suit or a criminal action a judge must be impartial . But such a matter as establishing identity is neither one , and there is no rule of law or equity which prohibits a court from being helpful . The situation is like that of a citizen who has lost his passport and appeals to his consul . The consul does n't sit as a judge ; he tries to get the mixup straightened out . So  --  Jake , you 've been in the Law much longer than I have ; do you want my opinions ? " " I am always most happy to have Judge McCampbell 's opinions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court and slam you for contempt . After I 've finished this drink . All right , you 're going to get ' em anyhow . Do you anticipate any difficulty in proving that the brain of Brother Schmidt was moved into the body of Eunice Branca ? " " None . A nuisance but no difficulty . " " Or in showing that this body  --  this lovely body  --  was once that of Eunice Branca ? " " Same answer . " " What evidence ? " " Police reports , photographs , hospital personnel , and so forth . " " Let 's say it 's my court . I 'm going to make you go back and touch second at every opportunity . I intentionally got into the record today that ruling based on Parsons ' estate v. Rhode Island ' ; I think it 's important  --  " " So do I. " " Thank you . In following the principle that identity lies in the brain and nowhere else "  --  ( We could tell him something , could n't we , Boss ? ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ! )  --  " I am going to be as tough as possible . No depositions when it is possible to bring the witness into court . Photographs and other records not only allowed but required  --  but the originals must be brought into court , not copies , and photographers or record keepers must appear and identify same , and the surgeons or others whose work appears in those films , photographs , or records must appear and confirm each record . Do you know if each body was fingerprinted just prior to surgery ? "  | " Not of my own knowledge . Damn it , I was taken by surprise today  --  and at the time of Eunice Branca 's death I had other things worrying me . " Joan Eunice reached over and squeezed his hand . Alec Train said , " I can help on that . When Parkinson brought Mrs. Seward to see me , I checked on that point at once . Prints were taken from both bodies  --  so I gave identity no further thought . That 's why I was taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what chimney-corner lawyer put the idea in Mrs. Seward 's head  --  Parkinson , probably ; he 's stayed at her elbow all through  --  but I received instructions just as court convened . I 'm not spilling any privileged communication when I say that  --  nor do I know of any Canon which forbids me to say that I am damn sick of both Mrs. Seward and Parkinson . " " Hmm . Every possible bit of evidence , " McCampbell went on . " You will have to trace that brain out of that body  --  Joan Eunice  --  no , Jake . Jake , do you know what became of Johann Smith 's body ? " " That one I can answer . Here we have a unique case of a body becoming a chattel while the person who lived in it is still alive . I knew what Johann Smith- - Joan Eunice , that is  --  had wanted done with it , as his will contains the standard donated for medical research ' clause . But the will did not control because Johann Smith was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to do with it . I told them to hold it , in their morgue . I assume that it is still there . " Mr. Train said , " Counselor , I hope you 're right . But unless that cadaver was nailed down , two gets you ten that some eager medical student has chopped it up . " The Judge said , " I 'm afraid Alec could be right . Jake , it may be a matter of great urgency to perpetuate the evidence  --  all the evidence . Verb . sap . We all know how key evidence has a way of disappearing when big money is involved . And besides eager medical students  --  well , we all know that almost any illegal act is for sale at a price . Films and records can be stolen , others substituted , ostensibly respectable witnesses can be bribed . Let 's speculate for a moment that Brother Schmidt is opposed by nameless dishonest persons , persons willing to bribe , suborn , and so forth . Such crime is not cheap . Does anyone have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to destroy or change the evidence ? " Jake said , " I wo n't guess . But in the case of four nameless females I can find out . " Joan said , " I can help a little on this . Marla and Elinor lost their father before they were of age and his estate wound up minus and no insurancep157to speak of . So I supported my daughter Roberta until she died and kept her kids in school until they flunked out , then continued to support them until each married  --  one of their grievances against me is that I stopped their allowances when they married . But I continued a credit watch on them , as I did not wany any descendant of mine to become a charge on the taxpayers . Much the same with the other two girls except that Jim Darlington outlasted my daughter Evelyn , and both girls  --  Johanna and June  --  married while their parents were living . To put it briefly , unless one of them has come into some windfall , all four could not scrape together enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm glad to hear it , " said McCampbell . " Just the same , Jake , time is of the essence in preserving evidence  --  and I want you to know that this court will give you all possible legal help in protecting and perpetuating any evidence you dig up . Unh , Alec and I plan to be away four days  --  but I 'll leave my emergency wavelength with Sperling and will bounce back here if you need me . " " Thank you , sir . " " Wait a minute , " said Alec Train . " There is money in this case . Mac , you know how I am about fees . " " Yes . Larcenous . " " Ignore him , Brother Schmidt . I tailor my fees , all the way from zero up to outrageous . In this case I did not want the job , so I demanded an outrageous retainer against a , yes , larcenous per diem  --  and Parkinson paid without a quiver . Through Mrs. Seward but there was no question as to who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on paying . . . and is he willing to hire his friendly , neighborhood safecracker to go after some necessary link ? I do n't know  --  especially as it is n't his money , but his mother-in-law 's . " " I do n't know , " answered Jake , " but I always assume that my opponent might cheat if I fail to cut the cards . I 'm going after that evidence with all possible speed . Sorry , Joan , I should have anticipated this -- I 'm getting old . " ( He is not . Tell him so , Boss . ) Joan Eunice patted his hand . " Jake , you are not getting old and there was no reason to anticipate this . Gentlemen , let me say again , I do n't care a whit if my granddaughters win . If they win , they lose  --  because if they prove me legally dead , I have cut them off with that shilling . And , thanks to Eunice Branca and Dr. Boyle and Jake Salomon , I 'm young and healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing a fortune that has become a burden to me. "  |p158Alec  Train said , " Brother Schmidt Joan Eunice honey , do n't you realize that it is unAmurrican to talk that way about millions of dollars ? " She grinned at him . " Brother Alec , if I come out of this broke , I 'll bet you a million dollars that I can net a million dollars after taxes in the next five years , starting from scratch . Jake , will you back my bet ? Since it calls for me starting broke ? " " Certainly . " " Wait a minute ! " Train protested . " I 'm just a poor but honest lawyer . Will you make that bet fifty cents ? Mac , will you lend me fifty cents ? " " Not without security . Joan Eunice , listen , please . I do n't doubt that you are willing to tackle the world broke . But I know in my heart that you are indeed Brother Johann Schmidt . . . who okayed a loan to me when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me down . . . and I 'm not going to let Brother Schmidt down . " " Thank you , Brother Mac . " Jake growled , " You frat house aristocrats made me sick when I was in college and I do n't like it much better today . Judge , the only good reason for giving Joan Eunice a hand is because it 's the fair thing to do . Not because she -- he  --  okayed a loan years ago to some snot-nose fraternity brother . " " Counselor , your point is well taken . I think I can truthfully say that 1 have never allowed fraternal bonds -- -including Shriner , which you and I are  --  to affect my behavior on the bench  --  " " The hell it has n't , old buddy mine ; you rule against me just for the hell of it . Ask anybody . " "  --  even when I 've been forced to instruct this Irishman in the finer points of the law . I would have helped in this matter in any case ; both as a citizen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any help a court can offer in establishing her identity . But I confess that my emotions were aroused by a circumstance that I did not dream existed . Not that Joan Eunice is my fraternity brother  --  that is simply a pleasing coincidence  --  butthat she  --  he at that time  --  gave me a hand when it mattered . Uh "  - -  he stared at his glass  --  " no need to go into details . You know them , Joan Eunice ? " " Yes . " " You can tell Jake later . Let me list the things I think are necessary in this case ; both of you lawyers check me  --  and I 'm going to stick a fresh tape in this thing so that we can all have copies . " He turned to his clerk 's recording equipment . " That is I think I am going to . Damn ! Excuse me , Joan Eunice . I wonder if Sperling has gone home . "  |p159(Let  's look at that thing , dear . ) " I 'm Brother Schmidt ' any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at your recorder ? It 's a bit like one I have at home . " " Go ahead . I sometimes wish we still used shorthand reporters . " " Thank you . " ( How about it , Eunice ? ) ( It 's Betsy 's idiot baby sister , no huhu . You whistle Yankee Doodle or think about Judgie Wudgie and do n't bother me . ) ( Om Mani Padme Hum . Om Mani Padme Hum . Om Mani Padme  --  ) ( Got it , dearie . ) " Recording with a fresh tape , Judge ; set for three copies , and erase memory . " McCampbell said , " I 'm amazed every time I find someone who understandsmachinery . " " I do n't , really . But Eunice Branca taught me to run one somewhat like yours . " ( Boss , you 're learning how to lie just tell the truth but not all of it . ) ( Honey girl , I invented that way of lying way back when your great-grandmother was a virgin . ) First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was murder , we will assume extensive records with positive identification including fingerprints  --  andsince they are police records , we must also assume that they are vulnerable to any determined and well-financed attempt to destroy or replace them . Then Mrs. Branca 's body must be followed into surgery and positive identification of the body again established at that point . Johann Schmidt 's body must also be followed to that point and positively identified just before surgery . Then we must be certain beyond any doubt that the brain was removed from the Schmidt body  --  Joan Eunice , this must be distressing to you . Would you like to retire to my washroom ? There 's a couch in there . " " Please go ahead , sir ; I 've learned to live with it . " ( Makes me feel like throwing up , Boss . ) ( Me , too , darling  --  but we are n't going to ; we 're going to look solemnly serene . Om Mani Padme Hum . ) ( Om Mani Padme Hum . Let 's make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , darling . Om Mani Padme Hum. ) "  --  and finally , in court , we will take Joan Eunice 's fingerprints , have them compared by experts with each earlier set , and thereby forge the final link . Joan Eunice , do I simply switch this off now ? " ( After the three copies pop out , it will shut itself off . ) " When the three copies pop out , it will erase and shut off . Jake , we 're keeping these gentlemen from their fishing . " " Those fish are n't restless , " the Judge assured her . " Just a moment . " He stepped to his closed-circuit viewphone . " Evelyn . " " Yes , Judge . "  | " How are things outside ? Quiet ? " " Judge , how did you guess ? I 've got three men in the infirmary and the building is buttoned up . You might take a look on three and four , and then play back the sixteen o'clock spot news . " " How badly were your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lungful of sneeze gas when we had to clear the main entrance and seal the riot doors , one with a flesh wound on a cheekbone , and the third with cracked ribs . My guess is the newsies bought ' emselves a riot , as cameras were in position when the trouble started . " " I see . Are we going to need the Guard ? " " I would n't say so . The police have the streets around us pretty well patrolled and our own people are either staying overnight or being taken off the top by chopper . Message from Judge Anders  --  says there 's no reason for you not to go fishing and he 'll assume that he 's presiding judge pro tem . He 's staying in his chambers tonight . " " I 'll call him and thank him . Off . " The Judge switched to view three , studied it . " Does n't look too rough . Just the same they ought to tear this building down and build a stronger one farther from any Abandoned Area . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " The room filled with crowd roar , the screen showed a milling mob . Moving slowly through the crowd were two police Merrimac tanks , their loudspeakers monotonously repeating the warning-to-disperse . " Brother Schmidt , does your house have a copter landing ? " Joan shook her head . " No , it 's designed so that a copter ca n't land on it . It seemed the safer choice when it was built . " " Well . . . I could put you into any enclave by copter . Or you could stay here overnight . " Jake said , " Judge , my car is a Rolls-Skoda . We 'll be all right . " " I ca n't force you to stay . But let 's get a playback on the news and see what stirred up the lice . " McCampbell punched the time in , then punched for playback . " Headline of the Hour ! Brain Transplant Fraud ! Our earlier flash has been confirmed ; the sensational brain transplant of Tycoon Johann Smith was a hoax . The question is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he murdered ? The latter theory seems likely in view of today 's bald-faced attempt to steal his enormous fortune through claiming in open court that his alleged former secretary , a woman of doubtful reputation going by the name of Blanca '  --  "  |p161Salomon  growled , " Judge , would you mind shutting off that damned rot ? " McCampbell switched it off . " Seems I started something . Ca n't say I 'm sorry . I will not let my courtroom be turned into a circus . " Joan Eunice said meekly , " I 'm sorry , Judge . " " Eh ? Joan Eunice , you are not at fault . You were forced into court needlessly and against your will ; you did nothing . As for me , I hold to the old-fashioned ideal that a courtroom is where the Sovereign is present in person , dispensing equity and justice to all . . . not bread-and-circuses for the rabble . As long as I 'm on the bench I 'll run it that way , no matter how many news snoops get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm sorry your bailiffs were hurt . " " Well , so am I. But they are n't conscripts , they are career people who know it is hazardous . And they are necessary  --  if that bill ever passes to disarm bailiffs , that day I quit the bench . . . and the Law as well . Jake ? " " Yes , Mac ? " " You can risk your neck if you want to , but even a Rolls-Skoda is not a Merrimac . Enough people can tip it over , then they can build a bonfire around it and roast you like chestnuts . . . and there are characters out there who would do it just for kicks . No , not a word out of you ; I 'm not going to let her leave this building in a ground car even if I have to reconvene court for three seconds and make her a ward again . She leaves by copter . The question is : Where does she go ? You could sleep in my chambers , Joan Eunice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washroom is a complete bath and that couch opens into a bed . Lumpy , I 'm afraid . " ( Ask . ludgie Wudgie if he goes with the bed ! ) ( I did n't hear you  --  and pipe down . ) " I was going to say , " Jake said mildly , " that I have a house in Safe I ! arbor . Unstaffed and empty but it 's a safe rendezvous . You could have your Chief Bailiff tell my driver and Shotgun to wait until this quiets down , then pick us up there  --  although I would bet on those boys to drive through any mob and not let the car be tipped ; they 're mean . " " No doubt . And wind up with a hit-and-run , too ; we 'll do it the easy way . Either of you want to use my washroom while I phone Evelyn and the roof ' ? " A few minutes later Jake and Joan were about to leave ; the Judge 's copter was waiting for them , he having brushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I think you know I am grateful , but I would like top162show my thanks by doing something  --  money , I mean  --  for those men who were hurt . " " No . " " Why not ? Oh , I know it was not my fault but nevertheless they were hurt because of me . You know I can afford it . " " Because they are officers of the Court and I would have to treat it as constructive bribery . Tell her , Jake . " " He 's correct , Joan  --  although he 's being stuffy about it . " " Not too stuffy . Joan Eunice , there is an enclave home for dependents of police , bailiffs , firemen , and such , killed in line of duty . Jake can tell you about it . I would rather not hear what you do about it . " " I see . " Joan ignored the fact that Jake was waiting with her robe , stepped closer to McCampbell , turned her face up , and put her arms around his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think so , " McCampbell answered , putting his arms around her . " But I wo n't analyze it . " " Of course it 's bribery ! Get away from him , Brother Schmidt ! handle his bribes . " " Shut up , you noisy Mick . " Joan turned her face just as her lips were about to touch McCampbell 's . " You 're next on my bribe list , Brother Alex . " " So get back into line ! R.H.I.P. " McCampbell stopped any further words from her ; she let her lips come softly open , did not hurry him . ( Whee .. . 000 ! I thought so . ) ( Do n't let me faint , Eunice . ) Some seconds later she opened her eyes , looked up into the Judge 's face . " My goodness ! " she said softly . Alec Train tapped his shoulder . " Court 's adjourned , Judge . Be else-where . " Joan gave the Judge a quick , possessive squeeze , untangled herself and went into his former roommate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful to make this kiss as long and as warm as the other . ( Unh ! What do you think , Eunice ? ) ( They are both oral as hell and they kiss almost as well as Jake and if Jake were n't here they would have us down on the rug this instant  --  break it up , dear ; you 've kissed him as long as you did Judgie Wudgie and Jake is getting edgy . ) ( All right . Spoilsport . ) ( Not at all  --  but you do n't know how to handle men without upsetting them . Break ! ) A moment later Jake silently helped her into her street robe . She thanked him , clicked the magnostrip , arranged the shoulder drape , let the Judge hand her into his lift . They said good-bye , the lift closed . Alec Train turned to his friend :  | " Mac , kissing Brother Schmidt is more emphatic than spreading most gals . " " Amen ! " " What would it be like to be married to her ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm always out for a short beer ? " " The O.B . damaged your head with his forceps . That 's why they had to make a lawyer out of you . " " How about yourself ? " " Oh , me , too  --  stipulated . I was n't bright enough to be a lawyer ; I had to wangle an appointment to the bench . Christ , what a chick ! " " Passed by acclamation . Mac , having kissed her , do you really think she can be old Sell ' em Johann , ' the terrible-tempered tycoon ? " " Well . . . everything fits  --  and she did have the Grip . " " And the password ; I checked . But , Mac , any of our brothers , even ones whose bias hardly extends to girls , would sell our secrets  --  what am I saying ?  --  would give them to that one . If she kissed him . " " Stipulating that you are correct in your estimate of our brothers  --  and I agree  --  Joan Eunice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Jake has practically had her under house arrest , at my suggestion . And Jake himself  --  well , he sounded like a Barb , but you can check it in that bookcase , in Who 's Who in Law . ' " " I do n't think I can walk that far . But let 's assume that old Johann was a brother  --  easy to check  --  and she did know all about the Distress Fund and the fact that you needed a loan our senior year . " " Yes . That 's the convincer . " " No , it 's not . I mean that Johann would have been just as susceptible . She was his secretary ; it might have amused him to spill fraternal secrets to her - grip , password , even details about the fund . " " Oh , crap , you honkie bastard . Joan Eunice is just what she purports to he an utterly delicious girl who has Johann 's brain in her skull . Alec , I concede that Joan Eunice does n't seem much like Johann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sponge between your ears were placed in the brainpan of a creature as delectable as she is . " The Judge shook his head . " She 's enough to make a queen switch from A.C. to D.C. " " Man , she really got to you , did n't she ? " " And you , my friend . Who said we needed a vacation from women ? You , as I recall . But you drooled over her . You would give up boys for life if she were to phone and ask for you . Do n't try to fool your roomie ; I know you better than Ruth does . " " I wo n't argue . But you 're at least as far down the Street as I am , Mac ... and she affected you the same way . Uh , does Norma know how little fishing we plan to do ? " " Sure she suspects . But she 's always been tolerant . Alec , how disappointedwould you be if I called off our trip ? Jake may need a friendly judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shyster unscrupulous enough to buy some direct action . I 'd hate to be missing if Brother Schmidt needed me . " " My God , a soul with a soul . Oddly enough I was thinking the same thing . Ca n't let Brother Schmidt down . Mac , could it prejudice anything if I volunteered my services  --  free  --  to Jake ? If this gets sticky , he 's going to need to be several places at once . I could share the load . " " And share the wealth . It would give you an excuse to see Brother Schmidt again . " " Any law against taking a profit ? But Jake does need help . " " And you 're familiar with the case . Alec old dear , it 's a noble thought . While you did represent the Petitioners , not only have they fired you , but this was never an adversary situation ; theoretically those creeps are as anxious to arrive at the truth for the benefit of their beloved grandfather as Jake is . They do n't dare admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wonder if Jake has a phone in that empty house he mentioned ? If not , I can leave word at the Gibraltar Club  --  he has rooms there  --  and at Johann Smith 's town house . And with Jake 's answering service . " " Yes . But let the call be from me ; it might speed the service . We 'll stay and wait for it . Ruth 's not expecting you , Norma is not expecting me ; I 'll have dinner sent up from the basement . " " Clear thinking . So fix fresh drinks while I put in those calls . Hey ! You can reach them in your copter . " " Only via the piloting circuit . Not private . Better we keep this tight . Alec , it is unlikely that Jake will have anything for you to do before morning . But he might  --  a trip to the coast or such . You could stay on call by spending the night here . " " Well ! " Alec Train stopped with his hand near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had driven all other thoughts out of your mind . Or did I misunderstand ? " " Let 's phrase it this way : It would be pleasant to discuss Brother Schmidt in intimate detail with some sympathetic person who appreciates her as much as I do . " " In that case , mix those drinks and start a lukewarm shower . I 'll join you as fast as I can . "  |p165Jake  Salomon handed Joan Eunice into the Judge 's copter , got in beside her and locked the door . Quickly they were airborne . The passenger compartment was separate from the pilot 's space and well soundproofed ; conversation was possible . But he said nothing and tended to keep his eyes away from her . Joan let it go on only a short time . " Jake dear ? Are you angry ? " " Eh ? Heavens , no . What made you think so ? " " You seemed quite distant . I thought you might be annoyed with me for having kissed Judge McCampbell and dear Mr. Train . " " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't scold me even by your manner . I 've had a difficult day , especially the time I had to spend with my goddam granddaughters . It hurts , Jake , to be hated . To know that someone wants you dead . Yet I had to try to appear serene and ladylike . Be a credit to Eunice . Jake , it is n't easy to be a lady  --  after almost a century of being male . Do you know how I manage it at all ? I say to myself , What would Eunice do ? '  - -  then I try to do it . Kissing those sweet and helpful men  --  Jake , I 'm not used to kissing men . You could have trained me but you wo n't give me more than a good-night peck . I said to myself , I must thank them  --  and what would Eunice do ? ' I decided that she would kiss them the best she knew how . So 1 tried , even though I do n't know how . Well ? Is that what Eunice would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Eunice would have kissed them . " ( He knows darn well I would have , dear . ) ( I know . He 's being difficult . ) ( So keep punching . Tell him how wonderful he is . Joan , men always believe it when you tell them they are wonderful . ) " Then I do n't see why you are being cold with me , Jake . I thought you were truly wonderful all day long , the way you handled things and protected me . I wanted to kiss you for being so wonderful  --  and would have , and will !  --  if only you would let me . Was it because I did n't stop to put my robe on before I kissed thern ? "  | " Well . . . it would have been more ladylike . " ( Punch hard on this one , dearie  --  for Jake knows darn well that I spread skin on him the very first time I kissed him . . . and later I kissed him bare naked the first time it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager. ) ( 1 ' 11 try . ) Miss Smith looked worried , which did not suit her features . " I suppose so . But I do n't know how to be a lady , Jake ; the rules have changed so much . Eunice often startled me by what she did and how she dressed -- yet I am certain that she was always a perfect lady . Tell me this , Jake , honestly and candidly , and I 'll treat your answer as Gospel and use it as a yardstick for future behavior  --  because I do want to be a credit to Eunice ; I want Joan Eunice ' to be the perfect lady that Eunice was . Under those exact circumstances and being just as anxious to show appreciation to two sweet and wonderfully helpful gentlemen . . . would Eunice have put this street robe on first ? Or would she have spread her sweet skin on them and let them cuddle her a bit if they wanted to -- and they wanted to , I 'm sure you noticed . Think about it , Jake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that  --  so give me a straight answer , because I 'm going to use it as a guide in trying to be Eunice . Would she have played safe ? Or would she have given herself ? " Jake Salomon gave a sigh that was almost a groan . " Hell , you did exactly what Eunice would have done . That 's what upset me . " Joan sighed . " Thank you , Jake , I feel better . " She loosened her seat belt , moved closer to him , ran her thumb down the magnostrip of her robe . " Ca n't get this pesky thing off in here . Kiss me , Jake , kiss me better than they did . Kiss me and cuddle me and tell me that Eunice would be proud of me . " " Joan ! " " Do n't shame me , Jake . I 'm a girl now and I need to be kissed so hard we 'll forget I kissed those other two . Call me Eunice , ' dear ; please do , it 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and tell me I 'm a good girl . " He groaned . " Eunice ! " She turned her face up . " Kiss me , darling . " Trembling , he gave in . The kiss went on and on . It took Joan only seconds to turn it from tender to rugged , nor did he hold back . ( Eunice ? I 'm going to faint . ) ( I 'm not going to let you , sweetheart ; I 've waited a long time for this ! ) Eventually Jake broke , but she stayed close and he continued to hold her . She sighed and touched her hand to his face . " Thank you , Jake dear  --  for this , and for everything . " " Thank you . . . Eunice . Joan Eunice. "  | " Let me be Eunice ' a while longer . Am I a good girl ? Do I do credit to her ? " " Uh . . . yes ! " " I tried . Jake dear , do you believe in ghosts ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't have done that well without her help . It often seems so . " " Uh , it 's an interesting thought . " ( Hmmph ! We ought to tickle him for that . Joan , if you tickle him under his short ribs , he comes unstuck . Helpless . ) ( I 'll remember . But not today . ) " In any case , she would have been proud of you . You 're a sweet girl . " " I mean to be . To you . I love you , Jake . " He hesitated only a heartbeat . " I love you  --  Eunice . And Joan Eunice . " " I 'm glad you made it both of us . Jake dearest , you 're going to have to marry me . You know that , do n't you ? " " What ? Oh , heavens , dear , do n't be silly . I love you  --  but there 's too much age difference . " " What ? Oh , fiddlesticks ! I know I 'm almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it no longer shows . And you understand me and no other man possibly could . " " Huh ! I mean I am too much older than you . " ( Joan , do n't let him talk that way ! Tell him men and liquor improve with age . Or some such . Anyhow , he was feeling quite young a few minutes ago  --  I noticed . Did you ? ) ( Yes . Now quiet , please . ) " Jake , you are not old . Goodness , I know what old ' is ! You 're a classic , Jake  - -  and classics improve with age . And ... just minutes ago , you were feeling quite young . I noticed . " " Uh . . . possibly . But none of your sass  --  youngster . " She chuckled . " Jake , it 's nice to be a girl to you . I wo n't argue , I 'll wait . In time you will realize that you need me and I need you , and that no one else will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest woman of me . " " Harrumph ! That might be more than I could manage , even with a marriage license . " " Rude darling . I can wait . You ca n't escape me , Jake . Eunice wo n't let you . " Well ... I 'm durned if I 'll argue ; it would just make you stubborn . In either of your personae . My old friend Johann was as stubborn a man as I 've ever met  --  and Eunice was just as stubborn in her own sweet way . And , dear , I never know which one you are . Sometimes I think you 've acquired that split personality your doctors were afraid of . " ( Get him off this subject ! ) ( I will , dear  --  but not by being jumpy about it.  |p168Are  n't we ever going to tell him ? ) ( Yes , of course . But not soon , Joan . Not till we 're in the clear . Remember those straps . ) " Jake darling , I 'm not surprised that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . Oh , nothing psychopathic , just the odd situation I am in . You 've known me how long ? A quarter of a century . " " Twenty-six years , pushing twenty-seven . " " Yes . And while I was never given to copping feels from female employees -- would you say that horny old bastard ' was an honest description of me ? " " I 've never known your behavior toward women to be other than gentlemanly . " " Oh , come now , Jake ! You 're talking to Johann at the moment . Level with me . " Salomon grinned . " Johann , I think you were a horny old bastard right up to the day we took you in for surgery . " " That 's better . Years after I was benched in the matter . . . first for social reasons , the fact that an old man looks a fool if he behaves like a young stud , and later through illness and physical incapacity  --  years after I was benched my interest in a pretty face or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy young body . Female . Look at me Jake . Female . " " I 've noticed ! " " Not the way I have ! Even though you 've kissed me  --  a real kiss and I loved it , dear -- you ca n't have noticed the way I have been forced to . I 'm cyclic now , Jake , ruled by the Moon ; I 've menstruated twice . Do you know what that means ? " " Eh ? Natural phenomenon . Healthy . " " It means that the body controls the brain as much as the brain controls the body . I 'm tempery and inclined to tears just before my period . My feelings , my emotions , even my thoughts are female  --  yet I have almost a century of male emotions and attitudes . Take my pretty little nurse-companion , Winnie  --  and would you like to take her ? " " Uh ... damn you , Johann ! She 's a nice girl . Fifth Amendment . " " She is indeed a nice girl . But because I 'm Eunice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's as female as a cat in heat -- and you 're an old bull , Jake , and dominant , and if you wanted to take Winnie , she would n't put up more than token resistance . " " Joan Eunice , do n't talk nonsense . I 'm three times her age . " ( Boss , what are you getting at ? ) ( I 'm not sure but I 'm getting there . ) ( Well , do n't get Winnie knocked up on the way . I thought we were saving Jake for us. )  |p169(Do  n't be a pig , little piglet . Winnie 's a nurse ; she sees to her contras as carefully as she cleans her teeth . ) " Jake dear , I 'm not much older than Winnie in my body . . . and you 've known and loved this body , even though I have no memory of it . We know that Eunice was always a lady -- so how did you ever manage to get started with her ? Did you rape her ? " ( Hell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushover . ) " That 's a most unfair question ! " " It 's a very female question . Knowing you from many years of association  --  and knowing Eunice both from some years of association but most importantly from now having her body and glands and hormones and deepest emotions  --  I suspect that you were far too proud to make a pass at her so she found some way to make clear that you were welcome . Once you were certain that Eunice was not trying to make a fool of you  --  that settled it . Well ? Am I right ? " ( If he says No , he 's lying . It took five minutes , sister  --  and would have been all over in ten but we were interrupted . Had to wait till next day . Remember the mermaid getup ? Had to scrub it off before I went home ; Jake and I ruined it  --  and I had to tell Joe a sincere fib . ) ( Did he believe you ? ) ( I think so . He was painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) " Jake , are you going to answer ? Or let me draw my own conclusions  --  possibly mistaken ? " " I could answer that it 's none of your business ! " " And you would be right and Johann apologizes . But not Eunice . Jake , that 's what Eunice 's body tells me must have happened . But I ca n't be certain and I do want to be like her and if that is not what she would have done because it is not what she did  --  then tell me . I 'm not asking for intimate details . " ( Aw , get the juicy parts , dearie  --  I want to know how it seemed to him , every sweaty detail . I already know how it seemed to me and I 'll tell you . ) ( Do n't be so right-now , darling  --  I 'm trying to gentle ( thin . ) " Joan Eunice  --  no , Eunice ! ' You always have had the damnedest way of get t ing your own way . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have Eunice 's memory . " ( Says who ? Boss , I 've figured out something -- -and it 's not flatworms . Everyone has erasable memory and non-erasable memory , just like Betsy  --  and that non-erasable part is the me that 's still here now that I 'm dead . Soul ' maybe . Names do n't matter ; it 's the part that 's not just glands and plumbing . ) ( Save the philosophy until we 're alone in bed tonight , Eunice ; I 'll trying to cope with a man  --  and it 's heavy going . ) ( Do you think we 're going to be alone in bed tonight ? Want to bet ? ) ( I do n't know  --  and I'mp170scared . ) ( Do n't be scared . When it happens , you recite the Money Hum and I 'll drive . Once around the course and you 'll be ready to solo . Except that I 'll always be with you . Know sumpin , Boss honey ? It 's even nicer to be you than it was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on ground rations . ) ( Huh ? ) ( Soul talk , dear  --  means sex . I had it for fourteen years  --  and I 'm hungry . ) ( I had it over five times that long  --  I 'm at least five times as hungry . ) ( Could be  --  you 're a horny bitch , Boss . ) Jake finally answered , " Joan , I do n't think it 's fair to Eunice 's memory for me to tell tales about her  --  but I 'll concede your point , assuming that you want to learn , for your own guidance , as much as possible about how she behaved . Eunice was honest and straightforward "  --  ( I 'm devious as a snake  --  but that 's what I wanted Jake to believe. )  --  " and she apparently decided that she liked me that much . . . and made it easy for me . It was neither rape nor seduction . " ( It was both , but I did not want him to think so . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  slip the bit into his . mouth . But let him think he asked for it . ) ( I 'll try . Meantime I 'm still doing this emotional strip-down  --  and you listen instead of interrupting ; you might learn something about me. ) ( 1 ' 11 be good , Boss . Mostly . ) " I felt certain that it must have been that way , Jake  --  knowing you , knowing her . But that 's only one side of me as I am now  --  the Eunice ' side . The other side is Johann , with almost a century of male orientation . I told you I now understand Winnie , as a girl  --  because now I am a girl . But there is still Johann , alone with Winnie every day  --  and it 's all I can manage to keep my hands off her . " ( Hmmph ! You do n't keep your hands off her . ) ( I said , Shut up ! I have n't let it get past heavy cuddle . If you and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be dessert , not the piece de resistance . ) ( That piece wo n't resist ! ) ( Hush up ! ) " Do you understand , Jake ? Old Johann  --  me !  - -  thinks that Winnie is quite some dish . " " Well . . . I understand it  --  in Johann . " " I wonder if you would understand it in Eunice ? Jake , how do you feel about homosexuality ? " " I do n't feel anything about it . Never been interested . " " Not even curious ? Jake , I 'm a full generation older than you are . When I was a kid , homosexuality or perversion ' as it was called , was hardly even a myth ; I never heard of it until long after I was centered on girls . Oh , I do n't mean there was n't any ; I know now that there was , lots of it . But it was spoken of seldom and kept under cover . When I was fifteen , a man made a pass at me  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he just scared me . " Would a fifteen-year-old boy today be that innocent ? You know he would n't be ; there are books and magazines and pictures  --  and otherp171boys to make certain that he understands even if he does n't join in . The Government just misses endorsing it as a way to hold down our outlandish overpopulation  --  would endorse it openly , I feel sure , if it were not that a large percentage disapprove of it publicly while practicing it in private . It reminds me of that weird period in my youth when people voted dry and drank wet and the bootlegger was more sought after than the black-market butcher is today . How long has it been since the last sex offense ' was prosecuted ? " " Rape by violence is still prosecuted ; I ca n't recall any others in the last twenty years . Blue laws about sex are dead letters ; Supreme Court decisions have made them impossible to prosecute . Correction : Unlicensed pregnancy is a Federal offense under the General Welfare ' clause ... but I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to reach the Supreme Court . " " ' That 's the only sex crime ' which was not a crime when I was a kid , Jake . But I was talking about the crime against nature ' which is no longer a crime ; it is n't even a peccadillo , it arouses less disapproval than smoking . I lowever , by the time homosexuality was socially acceptable , my attitudes were long frozen . But I wonder what Eunice thought about it ? Did you ever discuss it with her ? " Jake snorted . " Believe me , Johann  --  sorry , Joan Eunice  --  that was not a subject we had time for ! " " I suppose not . Nor did she discuss it with me . " ( Fibber ! ) " But she gave me a gentle reprimand about it once . " " So ? How ? " " Oh , one day before I was bedfast , a messenger delivered something to my office . He was a real nancy-pants  --  lots of makeup , false eyelashes , curled hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lisp and oh so graceful in his gestures . After he was gone I made some intolerant remark and Eunice told me gently that , while she did n't find such one-way boys attractive , she did n't see anything wrong in a man loving man , or a woman loving a woman . " ( Hey ! I do n't remember any such conversation . ) ( So I 'm a liar . But you could have said it  --  and I 'm making a point . ) " Yes , that sounds like Eunice . She was tolerant of people 's frailties . " " My point is that , Eunice being the age she was , she was certain to be Indifferent to  --  perhaps I should say understanding about ' what Johann thought of as perversities . ' But here 's what I 'm getting at , Jake : I find 1Viunie sexually attractive . I also find Alec Train and Judge McCampbell sexually attractive . Startled me . And you  --  which did not startle me . But today was the first time I have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shook me . " ( How about dear Doctor ? ) ( None of your lip , sweet lips  --  we do n't tell Jake that one . ) Joan Eunice went on , " There is my dilemma . Which time am I being homosexual ? With Winnie ? Or with you three very male bulls ? " " Joan , you ask the damnedest questions . " " Because I 'm in the damnedest situation a man ever found himself in . I 'm not the ordinary sex change of a homo who gets surgery and hormone shots to tailor his male body into fake female . I 'm not even a mixed-up XXY or an XYY . This body is a normal female XX . But the brain in it has had a man 's canalization and many years of enthusiastic male sex experience . So tell me , Jake , which time am I being normal , and which time perverse ? " " Uh ... I 'm forced to say that your female body controls . " " But does it ? Psychologists claim that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in the genitals . My brain is XY . " " I think you are trying to confuse the witness . " " No , Jake , I 'm the one who is confused . But possibly not as confused as the young people today . You know they claim to have six sexes . " " Heard of it . Nonsense . " " Not entirely . I 've been doing lots of reading during my de-facto house arrest , trying to find out who I am , what I am , how I should behave . They label these so-called sexes both by behavior and physiology , with a new school of psychology  --  when was n't there a new one ?  --  to account for them . The six are ortho-male , ortho-female , ambi-male , ambi-female , homo-male , homo-female  --  and some list a seventh , the solos or narcissists . Even an eighth , the non-sex , the neuters , both physical and psychologi-cal . " " And I say it 's nonsense . " " I do , too , but not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both physiological sexes directly and not by hearsay , I say there is just one sex . Sex . SEX ! Some people have so little sexual drive that they might as well be neuters no matter whether they are concave or convex . Some people have very strong sexual natures  --  and again the shape of the body does n't figure . Such as my former self , horny long after sex had abandoned me . Such as you , darling  --  taking a lovely young married woman less than half your age as your mistress . Such as Eunice  --  happily married at home , I think  --  " " Yes , she was . I felt guilty about it . " " But not too guilty to share her riches . Jake , I would n't speak to you if you had scorned her . I was about to name Eunice as my third example of ap173person strongly sexed . Enough sexual drive in her body  --  I know !  --  for anything . Enough love in her heart  --  I feel certain  --  for any number . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too warmly empathic to mock me by offering me what I could not accept  --  and did give me , lavishly , the only thing I could accept  --  her beauty , for my eyes . Jake , I think Eunice was limited in her love only by time . She kept you happy  --  " She certainly did ! " " I 'm just as certain she did so without depriving her husband . Jake , do you have reason to believe that she limited herself to you  --  and her husband ? " " Uh - Damn you , Johann ! I do n't know . But I do n't think she had time . Ith , I used up all the sneak-out time she could manage . " ( Look , Boss , I 'll tell you about every time I struck a blow for equal tights . Do n't pester Jake . ) ( You 're missing the point , Eunice . I 'm forcing lake to move Saint Eunice off her pedestal  --  that 's the only way we 'll ever get him . ) " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did n't tell you the same sort of little white lies she told her husband ? For that matter , Jake , Joe may have been as proud of his antlers as an old buck deer  --  the percentage of husbands who are pleased by their wives ' adulteries has been climbing steadily in this country at least since nineteen-fifty  --  see any of the kinseys . Thal he loved her we both are certain . That does not prove he tried to keep her in a cage . Or wanted to . " " Joan , I would just as lief you did n't run down Eunice to me . " " Jake darling ! I am not running her down . I am trying to find out what you know about her , so that I can model myself more closely after her . I loved her - and love her still more today . But if you told me that you knew she was mistress to six other men , a whore on the side , and playing girl games in her spare time  --  well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I would try to go and do likewise . You have n't told me much but what you have told me confirms what I believed  --  that Eunice was a perfect lady , with enough love in her heart to love three men at once and give each of them exactly what he needed to make him happy . " ( Thank you , Boss . Shall I bow ? ) ( Quiet , little darling . ) " But not a wanton , never a slut , sod while she was n't prudish  --  I doubt if Winnie would have interested her . " ( Now wait one frimping minute ! ) ( I 'm telling him what he wants to hear , dear  --  if you want Winnie , we 'll keep it out of Jake 's sight . ) ( Who wants Winnie ? You dirty old man ! ) ( We both do  --  but it may be smart nrvel to let it hatch . Dearest , Winnie would n't look at us with a man mound . ) ( Want to bet ? ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inheritance it would be easy for me to turn ambi-female . I 'm not going to , because I do n't think Eunice would . With the deep female drive this body has  --  bloodstream brimming with hormones and gonads the size of gourds is the way it feels  --  1 could easily become No-Pants Smith , the Girl Most Likely To . ' Very easily  --  as Johann Smith was an old vulgarian who regretted only the temptations he had been forced to pass up . But I 'm not going to do that , either , as Eunice did not behave that way . But if I do n't get married fairly soon , I 'm going to find it hard to stay off the tiles . " " Joan , 1 love you  --  but I am not going to marry you . It 's out of the question . " " Then you had better help my granddaughters to swindle me . " " Eh ? Why ? " " You know why . A multimillionaire who is young and female stands as much chance of getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chasing that asbestos cat through Hell . Lots of them in our country  --  and all they ever got were Georgian princes , riding masters , and other gigolos . I do n't want one , wo n't have one . 1 'd rather be broke , like Winnie , and take what love I can find . Jake , besides the fact that you understand me and no one else can , you 'd still be in my top ten because my money does not impress you . Quite aside from wonderful fact that I love you and you love me , any marriage broker would call us a perfect match . " " Hardly . There 's still the matter of age  --  body ages . Joan , a man who marries at my age is n't taking a wife , he 's indenturing a nurse . " " Oh , frog hair , Jake ! You do n't need one and I 'll lay even money that you 'll stay strong and virile right through my breeding period . But when you do need one 1 ' 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Song ' you lead , I 'll harmonize . " " I sing bass . And I wo n't sing September Song . ' " " Jake ? We could buy you a new body . When you need it . " " No , Joan . I 've had a long run and a good one , most of it happy , all of it interesting . When my time comes , I 'll go quietly . I wo n't make the mistake you did , I wo n't let myself fall into the hands of the medics , with their artificial kidneys and their dials and their plumbing . I 'll die as my ancestors died . " She sighed . " And you called me stubborn . I 've taken you up on a high mountain and shown you the kingdoms of the earth  --  and you tell me it 's Los Angeles . All right , I 'll quit pestering you  --  and humbly accept any love you can spare . Jake , will you take me out on the town and introduce mep175to eligible young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eunice may he too naive , too inclined to think the best of people . " ( Rats , Boss , I bought me a gigolo with my eyes open . . . and , since I was n't kidding myself , I bought top quality . ) ( I know you did , darling  --  but the Joe Urancas in this world are as scarce as the Jake Salomons . ) " Joan Eunice , if you want me to escort you , I 'll be honored . . . and I 'll try to keep pascoodnyaks away from you . " " I 'll hold you to that , you not-so-very-old darling . Jake , I asked if you believed in ghosts . Do you have any religion ? " " Eh ? None . My parents were Orthodox , I think you know . My Bar Mitzvah speech was so praised that I had to fight to study law instead of being trained as a rabbi . But I shook off all that before I entered college . " " Parallels me , somewhat . My grandparents came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priests had a crack at me first . Then we rnoved to the Middle West before 1 started school , and Papa , who was never devout , decided it would be better  --  better for business , maybe  --  to be a Baptist . So I got the Bible-Belt routine , with hellfire and damnation and my sins washed away with full immersion . It was the Bible-Belt indoctrinationthat stuck , particularly the unconscious attitudes . " Rut , consciously and intellectually , I shucked off all of it when I was fourteen -- probably the only real intellectual feat of my life . I became an aggressive atheist  --  except at home  --  and scorned to believe in anything I could not bite . Then I backed away from that  --  atheism is as fanatic as any religion and it 's not my nature to be fanatic  --  and became a relaxed agnostic , unsure of final answers but more patient . I stayed that way three-quarters of a century ; I left religion to the shamans and ignored it . " " My own policy . " " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dead . " " What ? You were never dead , Joan  --  Johann , damn it !  --  you were merely unconscious . " " I was n't , eh ? With no body , and my brain cut off from the world and me not even aware of myself ? If that is not death , Jake , it is an unreasonable facsimile . I told you that I thought Eunice 's spirit has often given me a hand . " " I heard you . I ignored it . " " You stiff-necked old bastard . I have n't taken up seances and such . But here is what happens . When I am in a quandary  --  often , these days -- I ask in ' sell ' , What would Eunice do ? ' That 's all it takes , Jake ; I know at once . No ectoplasm or voices from a medium just instant knowledge not based tin my own experience . Such as this afternoon when I decided in a splitp176second to kiss Alec and Mac . No hesitation  --  you saw ! That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and yet you tell me I have n't missed behaving like Eunice even once . That 's why it feels as if her sweet spirit were guiding me . Any comment ? " " Mmm ... No . You do behave like her . . . other than when you tell me flatly that you 're speaking as Johann . But I do n't believe in ghosts . Johann , if I thought I had to go on being Jake Salomon throughout all eternity , I 'd  --  well , I would register a complaint at the Main Office . " " Let me tell you what happened to me at the Main Office . " " Huh ? " " While I was dead , Jake . I was in this  --  place . There was a very old Man with a long white beard . He had a big book . He looked at me , then consulted His book , then looked back at me . He said , Son , you 've been a bad boy . But not too bad , so I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't worry ; you 'll have help . ' What do you think , Jake ? " ( What is this , Boss ? Did it happen to you , too ? ) ( Eunice , if it happened to you , it happened to me ; it 's the same thing . And you are my help , beloved . My guardian angel . ) ( Oh , frimp you ! I 'm no angel , I 'm me . ) ( A very earthy angel , beloved darling  --  just what I need . ) ( Love you , too , you dirty old man . ) Salomon answered slowly , " Anthropomorphism . Right out of your Bible-Belt Sunday school . " " Oh , certainly . It had to be in symbols I could understand . If I had been a creature from around Proxima Centauri , the old Man and the beard might have been a Thing with eight tentacles and faceted eyes . Cliche symbols are nothing against it ; I 've never thought it was a physical experience . Men live by symbols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real to me as any physical experience . And allow me to point out that I do have a second chance and I have , and am having , lots of help  --  from you especially , from Mac and Alec , from doctors and nurses . . . and also from something inside that tells me instantly , in any difficult situation , exactly how Eunice would handle it . I do n't say it 's Eunice . . . but it 's not Johann ; he would n't know how . Well ? " Salomon sighed . " Of the inventing of gods there is no end . And almost always anthropomorphic . Joan , if you are going in for that sort of self-delusion , why not go whole hog and join a nunnery ? " " Because Eunice would not . Although she might enjoy revamping a monastery . " Jake chuckled . " She might , at that . " " Maybe I should try it  --  since you are so damn chinchy about making mep177an honest woman . More likely I 'll change my name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bombay . Will you come visit me , Jake ? " " No . Too hot . " " Chinchy . Mean old Jake . You would n't refuse to go see Eunice because of heat . " " Eunice would never wind up in a crib . " " No , she would n't . So I have to go on being a lady even though it 's quite a strain on old Johann . " " Poor you . All you have is youth , beauty , and half as much money as the I.R.S. " " And you , Jake . I could lose the rest and still be rich . " ( I was wondering if you would see that opening . Sister , you do n't need my advice ; I think I 'll take a vacation . ) ( You promised to stay ! ) ( Yes , Boss darling . I ca n't leave ; we 're Siamese twins . But even if I could , I 'd stay because I want to . ) ( Eunice beloved , I have never been happier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jake . " Jake dear , I have never been happier in my life . " A brassy voice from the cockpit said , " I am about to swing for landing . Please secure seat belts . " Salomon answered , " Seat belts fastened and now being tightened . Proceed with landing . " To Joan he said , " Straighten up , Eunice  --  and do snap up that magno . " Joan Eunice pouted her lip and obeyed.  |p178Security  check took little time ; Salomon was known to the enclave guards and the copter was expected . It was a short walk from the landing to Salomon 's house but , as in all upper-class enclaves , inhabitants in sight outdoors pretended not to see them . The door opened to Jake 's voice and again they were private . Joan Eunice took off her street robe and handed it to Jake , saying , " May I look around ? Jake , it 's been years since I 've been here ; you 've made changes . " " Some . Moved my personal gear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but furniture which I 'll sell with the house . Oh , I keep some clothing and toilet articles here , and I can find us a drink and a tin of biscuits . Perhaps smoked oysters or caviar ; we have to kill an hour or two . Or I could send out for dinner . " " Let me see what there is in your kitchen ; I would enjoy playing housewife . And I do want to look around . " " Look all you like , but tell me what you want to drink . Joan , have you ever been in a kitchen ? " " None of your lip , lad ; I 'm a good cook . Mama taught me to make Apfelstrudel  --  dough you could read print through and so light it melted in your mouth  --  before you were born . Sherry , or a Dubonnet highball  --  no Schnaps , I 'm not risking it yet . " " I 'll stack my kosher cooking against your Bavarian messes any day , girl . The Goyim ca n't cook the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pooh , you fake Jew . You have n't tasted my pot roast with noodles . I bached between wives  --  and cooks  --  and mistresses , and I always cooked . Jake , would n't it be fun to cook for each other and swap recipes ? We could do it here . I do n't dare enter my own kitchen ; Della would faint . " " Might be fun . We can eat my cooking when your boasts do n't pan out . Excuse me ; I 'll see what liquor there is . " Joan Eunice headed straight for the master bedroom . ( Eunice , is this onep179of ' the places ? ) ( Of course . See that sag in the bed ? Boss , this is the only ( place we managed an all-night . Heavenly ! ) ( All night ? ' Then his mobiles do more than suspect ; they know . ) ( Oh , they may suspect but it does n't : natter . Charlie is n't interested in women , and Rockford  --  well , he 's on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or dishonest  --  and my conduct was all three , by his standards . He 's an atavism . But the all-night  --  I doubt if they suspected . We used more fan-dancing to keep it ( lilt of their sight than Joe 's sight  --  things involving two hired Brink 's cars and a non-existent errand for you . ) ( How did you fan-dance it for Joe ? ) ( Did n't . I thought up a story and told Jake I would use it  --  then told Joe that I had met a man I wanted to spend a night with . . . did he mind if I was away Friday night ? ) ( As simple as that ? ) ( Yes , Boss . We both were free but we were careful never to hurt each other . Only a second-class contract  --  since I was licensed for children and Joe was not . Either of us could have registered a dissolution on three days ' notice . ) ( But what did Joe say ? ) ( Nodded and went on painting . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe was always sweet . But he may not have missed me . He was painting from a new model , a beautiful boy who was a frimp type . Joe may have been changing his luck ; he sometimes did . ) ( And you did n't mind ? ) ( That beautiful boy ? Boss , you 've got to move into the twenty-first century , now that you 're me . What possible harm ? I 've told you and told you that Joe and I were always careful of each other 's happiness ; what more could I ask ? Besides , I do n't know that Joe had his eye on him other than as a model but-well , if they had invited me to move to Troy with them , I would n't have minded , for a night or two . I 've always preferred older men  --  but the boy was pretty as a Palomino and clean as a sterilized cup I would n't have found it boring . Plus the fact that a woman is flattered if two males like her enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eunice my love , you continue to startle me . That angle I would never have thought of . Yes , I guess it would be a compliment , in a way . I think that men  --  even men today  --  are shyer about such things than women are . ) ( Men are horribly shy , Boss  --  whereas women usually are not . We just pretend to be , when it 's expected of us . Look , a woman is a belly with a tine bomb inside , and women know it and can never get away from it . I hey either quit being shy  --  no matter how they behave to please men  --  or they go crazy ; it 's the choice we have to make . And high lime you made that choice , dear . Accept your femaleness and live with it . Be happy . ) ( I think I have . ) ( You 're coming along . But sometimes it feels like thep180bravado of a little boy who says , I am not either scared ! ' when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightened . ) ( Well , maybe . But I 've got you holding my hand . ) ( Yes , dearest . Mama will take care of you . ) Joan went into Jake 's bathroom , primarily to snoop . She had just found something she half expected to find  --  when she heard Jake 's voice . " Hey ! Where are you ? Oh ! Coming , or going ? Fixed you Chablis over ice , best I could do . " " That 'll do fine . Jake . Was this hers ? " She held up a luxurious negligee  --  two ounces of cobweb . Jake gulped . " Yes . Sorry . " " I 'm not sorry . " Suddenly Joan stripped off the Cling-Ons , shoved down her frill-skirt panties and stepped out of them , leaving her bare from sandals to eyebrows , put on the negligee . " Do I wear it the way she would ? Wups , I wrapped it man-style . " She rewrapped the lap-over to the left . " Do I do her justice ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , let it slither to the floor , went into his arms , let him sob against her face . " That 's enough , darling , Eunice does n't want you to cry . Eunice wants you to be happy . Both Eunice and Joan Eunice . Hold me tight , Jake . We 're lost and lonely  --  and all we have is each other . " While she cuddled him and soothed him , she opened the zipdown of his shirt . ( Eunice , I 'm scared ! ) ( Easy does it , dear . Chant the Money Hum to yourself ; I 've taken over . Om Mani Padme Hum . ) ( Om Mani Padme Hum . Om Mani  --  ) Joan was jerked out of it by the telephone signal . She pulled her mouth from Jake 's and started to cry . " Oh , damn ! " Jake said huskily , " Ignore it . It 's a mistake , no one knows I 'm here . " " Uh  --  If we do n't answer , they 'll try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , dear . Where is the pesky thing ? Living room ? " " Yes , but there 's an extension over there . " " Keep thinking nice thoughts . " Joan hurried over , high heels tapping , stood close to the pickup so that only her face would be seen , flipped the switch  --  said in Eunice 's most crisp secretarial voice : " Mr. Salomon 's residence . Who is calling ? " The screen stayed blank . " Recorded . Urgent call for Counselor Salomon , third attempt . " " Urgency noted . Proceed . Who is calling ? " Another voice came on , screen still blank . " This is Mr. Salomon 's answering service . Judge McCampbell has placed an urgent call . I told the Judge that the Counselor was more likely to be at his club or at thep181Johann Smith residence , but he insisted that I keep trying this code , too . Is he there ? " " One moment . " Joan glanced back , noted with annoyance that Jake had closed his shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salomon . Can you reach Judge McCampbell ? I will hold . " ' Thank you . One moment . " Joan stepped still closer and tilted the pickup to make certain that it caught only her face . Jake stepped up d y her , handed her her clothes . She accepted them , did not put them on . The screen lighted . " Jake , we  --  Hey ! Brother Schmidt ! " " Alec ! How nice ! " " Step back so I can see you , dear . Mac , do n't shove , " Train added as the Judge 's face appeared by his in the screen . " Is Jake there ? " " Right beside me , boys . " " All I can see is his shirt . Stand on a box , honey , so that you 're both on % rcen this must be a four-way conference . Or back away . " " I Jere he is . " Joan tilted the pickup higher , reluctantly pressed the cups to her breasts , stepped into her frill-skirt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Can you see me now ? " " Not well enough , " the Judge 's resonant baritone answered . " Jake , back oil a little . Joan , you need a stool . Better yet , Jake , hold her up in your amts you lucky man . " " What 's the message , gentlemen ? And , thank you , Judge , for your flitter . We were delivered quickly and safely . " " De nada , compadre . Jake , my old roomie got a brilliant idea  --  no doubt tinough long association with me . " The Judge explained what each was willing to do in order to speed confirmation of Joan 's identity . " This can be our comm center . I am going to live in my chambers a few days  --  ready to issue a warrant , phone a judge in another jurisdiction or whatever . Then we 'll rush it through my court and crowd them into an appeal  --  get this milled down tight . Meanwhile Alec is your man Friday . Want him to go anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and losing a night 's sleep to Ilene. /one changes is good for him . " " Prohably not before morning . But I 'm relieved , gentlemen ; I 've been wuudrring how I could be everywhere I need to be . Since I 'm retired from everything but Joan 's personal affairs , I 'm without staff  --  and I 've beennudgeling my brain trying to think whom I could get who would be fellable and competent . As we all know , this is touchy . " We know ! " agreed Alec . " And we 're going to fix those harpies  --  aren'twe , Mac ?  | " Yes  --  but legally and so that it can not be reversed . Jake , you can reach us here  --  and do n't hesitate to wake us if you decide you want Alec to catch a midnight liner . Where will you be ? Your house ? " " Until my car arrives ; then we 'll be at Joan 's . Or on our way . My answering service can flip you into my car 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll be in touch . Do n't worry , Jake , and do n't let Joan worry . We 'll have her baptized before you can say missing heir . ' " " I 'm not worried , " said Joan , " but I feel like crying . Boys  --  Brothershowcan I thank you ? " " Shall we tell her , Mac ? Would she blush ? Thank me , that is , Brother Schmidt ; do n't thank Brother Mac ; he 's just doing his duty , what the taxpayers reluctantly pay him for . But you can thank me  --  I 'm a volun-teer . " " I 'll thank you both , in whatever way you wish , " Joan said simply . " You heard that , Mac ? Brother Schmidt committed herself  --  and you ca n't break a promise between Brothers , that 's the old Bita Pi law . Brother Schmidt Joan Eunice honey , back off and let us see all of you . Jake , get out of pickup ; you ruin the composition . Go have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's drunk , " advised his former roommate . " So 's Mac , we 've been working on it . But I 'm not too drunk to hop a guided missile , Jake , if you say to . " " Jake , " said the Judge , " this is getting out of hand . Not that I disagree with this low forehead 's enthusiasm . Good night , sir . Good night , Joan . Off . " Joan Eunice flipped the switch , made certain that the screen was dead , started undressing . " Joan . Stop that . " She went on removing her saucy , scanty clothing , heeled off her sandals , then stood facing him . " Jake , I refuse to be treated like a porcelain doll . You had me expecting to be treated as a woman . " He sighed . " I know . But the golden moment passed . " " Well ... I 'm not going to dress . You 've seen this body many times , we both know  --  and I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm shy , Jake ; I 'm only weeks old , as a woman , and not used to it . But I want to get used to it . With you . " " Well --  As you wish , dear ; you know how beautiful I think you are . What shall we do ? Read aloud to each other till my car arrives ? Watch video ? " " Beast . If you were a gentleman you would at least take your clothesp183off . Instead you are a difficult , stubborn beast and 1 do n't know why I love you . Except that Eunice loved you  --  loves you , wherever she is  --  so I have to love you . Jake , if you wo n't take me to bed , at least sit down in that big chair and let me crawl up into your lap . We can talk . We 'll talk ; shout Eunice. " lie sighed . " Girl , you 'll give me a heart attack yet . All right , come curl tip in my lap . On one condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll agree to any conditions . I 'm in a very unstable state . " " You certainly are , dear . But it 's my lap . No ticky , no washee . " " I should go back to the courthouse ; I do n't think Mac and Alec would insist on conditions . Might as well relax , Jake ; I 'm climbing into your lap with no more yatter . There ! That 's better . Arms around me , please . " " First the condition . That you not try to rape me in a chair  --  " " Do n't think I could . " " You 'd be surprised what can be done in a chair , Joan . " " Would not , I 've done ' em all . As Johann . But they require coopera-tion . " " Mmm , so they do .  --  and that , as soon as my car arrives , you dress at once and no nonsense , and we go home . " " All right -- since you made that we . ' I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . In which case I was going to have Rockford and Charlie take me straight back to Alec and Mac . Are n't they delightful wolves , Jake ? Hold me tight . The only way you can protect me from them is you-know-what . " " Hmm . Joan , can you keep a chuckle to yourself ? " " Well . . . I promise never to tell anyone but Eunice . " " Eh ? Okay , I do n't think you would break a promise made that way . lint , let me add that if you did tell , it would hurt Alec and Mac both  --  and Eunice would not like that . " " No , Eunice certainly would not like that . Jake , you 're going to be able to hogtie me with that phrase the rest of my life . " ( Do n't fret , Boss honey . Any time Jake is wrong , I 'll give you the ammo to change his tune . ) " All tight , I 'll tell no one but Eunice  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see Him . " ' Safe enough . Okay , here 's the chuckle . Your two charming wolves  --  and they are charming  --  are as gay as Julius Caesar . " " What ? Jake , I have trouble believing that . " " I wo n't offer proof but I assure you that I know it beyond any reasonable doubt . "  | " But  --  Look , dear , I 've kissed them . I may be an ersatz female ... but not where it matters , and I know those kisses were n't phony . They were hot over me . Shucks , darling , I could tell it by Braille . Besides , they are married . " " I said , As gay as Julius Caesar , ' dear  --  not Governor Arkham . " " Oh . Ambi gay , you mean . I still have trouble believing it . Does n't it show at all ? Even in a kiss ? " ( I spotted it , Joan , the potential at least . But they 're still wolves . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank them . ) ( Eunice , is that the only way a female can thank a man ? ) ( That 's the only convincing way , twin . This is news ? ) ( No , beloved  --  but it was possible that your generation had learned something mine had not . They have n't . Not in anything you 've told me . Just more open about it . ) " Joan , there is no way to spot it , if an ambi does not want it known . Either ambi , or clear over the line and no return . Look , when you were Johann , could you spot a virgin ? " " Jake , I 'm not sure I ever met a virgin . But you have . " " You must mean someone we both know . " " Of course . " " Who ? Winnie ? Would n't have thought so . But she does blush easily . " " Not Winnie . If she is one , I did n't have her in mind . " ( You crawled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own secrets . Honey girl ? Does Jake know about your baby ? ) ( No , and we 're not going to tell him ! ) ( Did n't intend to , darling just did n't want to be caught foolish . ) " Well , I ca n't guess . Who is this paragon ? " " Me , " " Uh  --  But  --  " Jake Salomon shut up . " Sure , sure , dear  --  Johann was not , and Eunice was married . Not to mention an old wolf who tripped her . " ( I tripped him . ) " But none of that applies to this new female in your lap . I 'm a virgin . But would not have been , by now  --  I think  --  if that goddam phone had n't sounded . Don Ameche should never have invented it . " " Who 's he ? Some Russian ? Alexander Graham Bell invented the tele-phone . " " An obsolete joke , Jake  --  sorry . Ameche played Bell in a movie , oh , about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's not talk about long-dead actors , nor my virginity that I ca n't get rid of ; let 's discuss Eunice . " ( My favorite subject ! ) " That overhead light is in my eyes ; where can I squeeze it down ? And will you keep your lap warm while I trot and do it ? " " I can do it from here . Is that better ? "  | " Oh , much ! I want to see you , darling  --  but floor lights are enough . Now tell me about Eunice . I not only want to be like her in other ways . . . but I would like to learn to make love the way she did . As much as you 'll tell me . " " Joan , you know I ca n't tell such things about a lady . " " But I am Eunice , Jake . I just do n't have her memory . So I need help . Eunice loved you , and still loves you , I feel certain  --  and Joan Eunice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fierce affection Johann always had for his one friend  --  Joan Eunice loves you with a love that comes also from Eunice 's sweet body that I wear so proudly . So tell me about her . Was she as eager as I am ? " " Uh  --  " ( Slide your hand inside his shirt , twin . Be careful not to tickle . ) " Joan , Eunice was eager . I had trouble believing it at first  --  me an old wreck and she so young and beautiful . But she managed to make me believe it . " " But you are not an old wreck , darling . You are in better shape than I was at your age . Oh , your face has character lines ; it has a granite majesty that impresses everyone . But your body is as firm and trim as a man half your age . Muscly . And your skin is smooth and elastic , not that distressing crepelike texture I remember too well . Darling . . . even if you divorce me later , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby ? " ( Hon , you 're knocking him out of the ring ! That 's one I never dared use . ) " Eunice ! Joan Eunice . " " Oh , I do n't mean soon enough for you  --  I mean soon enough for me . I may have fifteen more fertile years  --  but the sooner the better ; a woman ought not to have her first baby at past forty . But you will be making babies as long as you live . How many children do you have , Jake beloved ? " " Three . You met two of them once . And four grandchildren . " " I do n't mean those , I mean others . I 'll bet you have at least a dozen more , here and there . You 've been rich a long time ; you could afford it . I low many that you have n't mentioned ? " " Joan Eunice , that 's snoopy . " " Yes , and no one has to answer that sort of question . But did n't Eunice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fibbed . I want to hear what he says this time . ) " Uh  --  " " I wo n't tell anybody but Eunice . Not even the old Man with the book . " " You insidious little cuddle puppy . I think I have four more . Plus one by a married lady who may have been kidding me . Three I supported untilp186they were on their own ; the fourth  --  and that possible fifth  --  I could n't even offer to . But they were never in want . " " How was it handled , dear ? Three maiden ladies who moved elsewhere and became overnight widows ? " " Uh . . . only in one case . I offered to marry her  --  I was a grass widower then  --  but she elected not to , and did marry later and her husband adopted the child and I made a cash settlement . The other similar case I was married but the settlement was just as amicable . The other two were married . Some grief about one  --  she was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  and her husband had to be soothed with mucho dinero . The last  --  well , her husband was sterile  --  mumps  --  and together they picked a father . Me . Startled the hell out of me . But he offered to put it in writing and did . I tore it up and settled it with a handshake . " ( This is all news to me , Joan . But I could n't believe that such a virile and charming man had left no by-blows . Keep him talking . ) Jake grinned and caressed her sweet body . " That is the only one I 'm certain about , as I have never insisted on blood tests if a lady accused me and I could have been the man . But in that case I am certain , as we took a holiday together , by sailboat , with her husband as nominal chaperonage . So that time it was I , at the right time and place . Then  --  " He paused . " Joan Eunice , I do n't know whether Johann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . but I do n't want to shock the sweet girl you are now . " ( Honey , do n't let him stop there ! ) " Johann ca n't be shocked , Jake . If it 's rough , I wo n't tell Eunice . But do n't let me crowd you . " " Well . . . it was n't rough , it was sweet . They did n't use inc and drop me . I was welcome in their home thereafter ... and in their bed . " " Three in a bed ? " " Uh ... do n't be nosy ! Sometimes . " " But no more babies ? " " They were licensed for four and had them . But I think they picked a different father for each . I simply know that , in the several times I stayed in their home over about ten years , I never slept alone . I still get Christmas cards from them , each with a photograph of the family  --  and my daughter looks like her mother , not like me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are a respectable married couple , devout , and devoted to each other and to their children , and old-fashioned . . . except that , when they were faced with the need for a donor , they elected to pick donors themselves , then use the old-fashioned way rather than syringes and a clinical atmosphere . " " Uh . . . was she sweet in bed ? "  | " Quite . But unsophisticated . Not a patch on Eunice , if you were thinking about her . " " I was . " ( I was ! ) " Eunice  --  Eunice was the most glorious thing that could happen to any man . Sweet as an angel , and as skilled  --  and as uninhibited !  --  as the most famous courtesan in history . " ( I 'm purring ! ) " Jake . I prefer the old-fashioned way , too . " " Yes ? " " You were sweet to all those ladies and you got two unmarried ones pregnant and I 'm rich enough to get away with it and right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will you pick me up and carry me over there ? Or shall I walk ? " " Eunice . " " Let 's both walk . But hurry . " " Yes . Yes , darling . " She jumped up , took his hand . . . as the house intercom sounded with : " Mr. Salomon ! Rockford here . Your car is waiting . " Joan said , " Oh , my God ! " and started to cry . Jake put his arm around her and petted her . " I 'm sorry , darling . " " Jake . Tell them to go get dinner . Tell them to be back in , uh , two hours . " " No , dear . " She stomped her bare foot . " Jake , I wo n't , I wo n't ! This is unbearable . " He said quietly , " You promised . Look , darling , I 'm not nineteen years old and able to perform in back seats of cars or on back porches with a party going on in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( Do n't believe him , dear ! Though he might be scared off for a first time . ) Joan bawled and shook her head . He spoke loudly : " Rockford ! " " Yes , sir ? " " We 'll be out in a moment or two . Keep the reactor warm . " He stepped to the wall and squeezed down the intercom to zero , then said gently , " Get dressed , dear . " " I wo n't ! If we leave now , you 'll have to stuff me into the car bare naked . " He sighed and picked her up ; she stopped crying and looked suddenly happy . The expression did not last . He turned her in his arms as he sat down on a straight chair , got a firm grip on her , and walloped her right buttock . She yelped . And struggled . He got her more firmly , placing his right leg over both of hers , andp188applied his hand smartly to her left cheek . Then he alternated sides , stopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Get dressed , dear . Quickly . " She stopped rubbing the punished area . " Yes , Jake . " Neither said another word until he had handed her into the car , climbed in after her , and they had been locked in . Then she said timidly , " Jake ? Will you hold me ? " " Certainly , darling . " " May I take my robe off , please ? Will you take it off me ? " With the robe out of the way she sighed and snuggled in . After a bit she whispered , " Jake darling ? Why did you spank me ? " It was his turn to sigh . " You were being difficult . . . and it is the only thing I know of which will do a woman any good when a man ca n't do for her what she needs . And right then  --  I could n't . " " I see . I think I do . " She remained quiet a while , enjoying his arms around her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dear ? Did you ever spank Eunice ? " " Once . " " For the same reason ? " " Not quite . Well , somewhat . She teased me into it . " ( I tickled him , dear . ( I And got the surprise of my life . ) " Then I 'm glad you spanked me , too . But I 'll try not to tease you  --  though I 'll never be the angel she was . " ( Fallen angel , Boss . AndH1 enjoyed it all , clear down to the Pit . ) " Jake ? " " Yes , Eunice ? " " I did n't really mind being spanked by you . Even when I was crying . But  --  Well , I 'm padded now  --  Built to take a spanking . And when you are spanking me , you are n't ignoring me  --  and any attention is better than none . And besides  --  " She hesitated . " Besides what , Eunice ? " " Well , I do n't know  --  but I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orgasm . Well , maybe . I do n't know what one is supposed to feel like . But while I was crying  --  and hurting ; you have a heavy hand , sir  --  suddenly I felt very warm inside and something seemed to grow and explode  --  that 's the best I can describe it . And I was ecstatically happy and did n't mind the last few wallops , hardly noticed them . Was that a female orgasm ? " " How would I know , dearest ? Perhaps you 'll be able to tell me . Later . "  | " Later tonight ? " " Uh , I think not , Eunice . It 's late and we have had nothing to eat and I 'm tired even if you are n't  --  " " I am , rather . But happy . " " So tonight we 'll rest . When it does happen  --  and I 'm no longer fighting it  --  let 's make the first time absolutely private and quiet . No phones and no servants and no distractions . After that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not a kid . You know what I mean , darling ; you 've been old , too . " " Yes , dearest , much older than you are . Eunice can wait . Jake ? What was this teasing Eunice did that was so bad it got her spanked ? " He suddenly grinned . " The little imp tickled me until I nearly went out of my mind . So I spanked her . But we were alone , and that ended satisfactorily . Quite . " " How ? " " How do you think ? I excelled my usual mediocre performance , and 1 ? unice  --  there are n't words for it , but she excelled her utter perfection , impossible as that sounds . " ( He darn near split me like a melon , twin  --  and I wanted him to ! ) " So ? Someday I will tickle you  --  and get spanked for it . So take your vitamins , dear . Jake , you enjoyed spanking me . Did n't you ? " He was silent several moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you neither as hard nor as long as I wanted to . And started feeling young ' as you put it -- but knew that , if I did n't get you out of the house right then , you probably would n't leave at all . And I do n't care to advertise it to servants . " " You had better marry me . So we can ignore servants . " " You had better shut up . You 're still learning to be a girl , and I 'm still learning how to handle you . You 're Eunice  --  but you are n't Eunice . And we must clear up legal matters before we talk about such things . " " Old mean . Girl beater . Sadist . Hold me tight . "  |p190Jake  escorted Joan Eunice to her boudoir . Winnie was waiting there  --  to Joan 's annoyance as she thought it possible that Jake 's stern character might slip if the upper house was quiet . But she did not show it . " Hi , Winnie ! " " Miss Joan ! Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course I 'm all right ; Mr. Salomon was taking care of me . Why were you worried , dear ? " " Why , the dreadful things they 've been saying about you in the news and there was a riot at the Hall of Justice ; I saw it . And  --  " " Winnie , Winnie ! The idiot box is for idiots ; why do you look at it ? I was never in danger . " " But she has had a trying day , so you take good care of her , Winnie . " " Oh , I will , sir ! " " And I am tired , too , so I 'll say good-night and go to bed . After I find a sandwich , perhaps . " " Hubert put a tray in your suite , sir . " " Hubert gets another merit badge . Though to tell the truth , Winnie , I 've had a worrisome day myself , and it 's left me with little appetite and jangled nerves . I may dine on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , Eunice ? " " Do n't take a pill . And do eat . " " But  --  " " I know , I 'm a bundle of nerves myself . But I know what to do about it  --  and Winnie and I can soothe your nerves and restore your appetite and make you sleep like a baby . " He cocked one eyebrow , looked at Eunice , then at Winnie . " I think either of you could . But both ? " " Jake , you 're a dirty-minded old man ; you 'll have Winnie blushing . But we can  --  ca n't we , Winnie ? The Money Hum . "  | " Oh . Yes , we can , Mr. Salomon . " " Harrumph ! Does it involve blood ? Or broken bones ? " " Oh , no , sir ! It 's restful . Relaxing . " " I 'll try anything once . " Joan said , " But you have to strip for it to  --  " " I thought there was a catch . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can wear shorts . We strip for it ; the spiritual effect is better . It 's the way we warm up for our exercises . Go undress ; then put on shorts and a robe . We 'll join you in the Green Suite . Right after it you 're going to have a bite to eat and a tepid tub and straight to bed and right to sleep . " " Maybe I 'd better bathe first . A day in court leaves me smelling like a skunk . " " You smell all right . Anyhow , Winnie and I have such control by now that we can decide not to be able to smell  --  or to hear a distracting noise , or anything  --  if we choose to . " " That 's true , Mr. Salomon . " " Okay . Winnie , if she beats me , you protect me . Adios , dears . " " Five minutes , Jake . " As soon as they were alone Winifred said , " You 're going to make me strip down bare ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strip the first time . And dear Doctor certainly did notice that you are a girl . Looked to me as if the kiss he gave you was better than the one he gave me . Stop blushing . Winnie , you can sissy , too , if you want to  --  but I do need you present . Or Jake will think I 'm trying to make him . " " Oh , Mr. Salomon would never think that about you . " " He 's male . He 's as male as dear Doctor . I need chaperonage , as all I 'm after is to help him sleep without pills . The poor dear has had a dreadful day . Winnie , he was wonderful in court ; I 'll tell you about it . Later . Let 's get these duds off and grab negligees . Modest-ones . " Joan Eunice stopped suddenly . " Perhaps I 've goofed . Winsome ? Do you have a date ? " Miss Gersten blushed again . " Uh . . . not until later . " " Paul working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my business . " The little redhead continued to blush but she answered steadily , " My business is always your business , Miss Joan . Uh , I 'm supposed to take careof you  --  and I do try ! But you feel like a big sister to me . " " " Thank you , sweet Winsome . But big sisters should not snoop . " " I 've been meaning to tell you . Paul and I have split . " " Oh , I 'm sorry ! "  | " I 'm not . I do n't think Paul ever meant to get a dissolution ; he was stringing me . But  --  well , Bob is n't married . Not yet . " " Not yet . ' Planning on getting married , dear ? " " Well ... I do n't think getting married is something one plans . It just happens . Like thunderstorms . " " You could be right . Sweet , whether it 's getting married , or fun and happiness , I hope it 's perfect for you . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be tempted to guess . If I do n't see him . " " You probably wo n't . He comes up the service lift and into my rooms from the back corridor  --  nobody sees him but the guard on duty . And they do n't gossip . " " If any guard ever gossips about anything in this house , and I find it out , he 'll be on Welfare so fast he 'll be dizzy . Winnie , the rest of the staff can be human about it . But a guard is in a specially trusted position and must keep his mouth shut . Winnie , if you ever want to see Bob  --  or anyone  --  somewhere else , I 'll have my mobile guards deliver you and pick you up , and even I wo n't know where . " " Uh . . . thank you . But this is the safest place for us  --  so few places are safe today . The most that can happen here is that Bob might be embarrassed . l would n't be embarrassed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the way to feel , dear . As an ex-man I know that 's the attitude a man values most in a woman . Proud of him . ' But let 's hurry ; we 're keeping Jake waiting . If you 're going to wear pants , better find some with stretch in them . And thank you for lending me this outfit  --  turned out that , without the apron and cap , it was still most effective . I had the robe off a while . Tell you later . " In moments the girls were hurrying down the corridor to the Green Suite , each just in a negligee and barefooted . At the last instant Winifred had decided that , if her mistress was going to practice meditation in the correct uniform , she would also . They found the counselor in a bathrobe , looking sheepish . Joan said , " I hope we have n't kept you waiting . Is your tub ready ? If not , I 'm going to draw it before we start . Then into it and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I cheated . I took a quick tub  --  tepid , as you specified  --  and ate a little , too . " " Good . Then we 'll pop you straight into bed after this and kiss you good-night and you 'll be asleep before we 're out the door . Jake , this is the simplest of yoga , not exercise , just meditation . Controlled breathing , but the easiest sort . Inhale through one repetition of the prayer , hold itp193through one more , exhale through one , hold through one , and repeat . All of us together , in a triangle . Can you sit in Lotus ? Probably not unless you 've practiced . " " Eunice  --  " " Yes , Jake ? " " My father was a tailor . I was sitting in tailor 's seat before I was eight . Will that do ? " " Certainly if you are comfortable . If not , any position that lets you relax . For you have to forget your body . " " Squatted in a tailor 's position I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Joan Eunice slipped off her negligee , melted down onto the rug into meditation pose , soles upward on her thighs , palms upward in her lap . " It goes like this . Din Mani Padme Hum . " ( Om Mani Padme Hum . I should have taught Jake this long ago . ) " I know the phrase . The Jewel in the Lotus . ' But what does it mean to you , Joan Eunice ? " Winifred had followed Joan 's example as quickly as she set it , was bare and in Lotus  --  and not blushing . She answered , " It means everything and nothing , Mr. Salomon . It is all the good things you know of  --  bravery and beauty and gentleness and not wanting what you ca n't have and being happy with what you do have and trees swaying in the wind and fat little babies gurgling when you tickle their feet and anything that makes life good . Love . It always means love . But you do n't think about it , you do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think . You chant the prayer and just be - until you find yourself floating , all warm and good and relaxed . " " Okay , I 'll try . " He took off his bathrobe , had under it boxer 's shorts . " Joan Eunice , when did you take up yoga ? Winnie teach you ? " " Oh , no ! " said Winifred . " Miss Joan taught me  --  she 's much farther along the Path than I am . " ( Watch it , Boss ! ) ( No huhu , Lulu . ) " One learns many things , Jake  --  and loses them for lack of time . I used to play chess , yet I have n't set up a hoard for fifty years . But for longer than that I could no longer even at tempt a Lotus seat . . . until Eunice gave me this wonderful young body which can do anything . " ( Which shell is the pea under , Eunice ? ) ( It 'll be under you if you relax too much ; you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dear . I sha n't go under , must watch Jake . ) " Join us , Jake . You lead , Winnie ; start as soon as Jake is in position . " Salomon started to sit on the floor , suddenly stopped and got out of his shorts . Joan was delighted , taking it as a sign that he had decided to give in to it all the way . But she did not let her serene expression change norp194move her eyes . Winifred was staring at her navel ; if she noticed it , she did not show it . " Inhale , " Winifred said softly . " Om Mani Padme Hum . Hold . Om Mani Padme Hum . Breath out . Om Mani Padme Hum . Hold ( Om Mani Padme Hum . Dig that clamdigger , dearie ? ) ( Shut up ! You 'll ruin the mood . Om Mani Padme Hum . ) " Om Mani Padme Hum ! " said Salomon in a voice that would have graced a cathedral . " Om Mani Padme Hum ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fade and wake up wide . We 're going to have to wake Jake . " The redhead 's eyes fluttered , she whispered one more prayer and waited . " Jake darling , " Joan said softly , " Eunice is calling . Wake just enough to let us help you into bed . Eunice is calling you back . Jake dearest . " " I hear you , Eunice . " " How do you feel ? " " Eh ? Relaxed . Wonderful . Much rested but ready to sleep . Say , it does work . But it 's just autohypnosis . " " Did I even hint that it was anything else ? Jake , I do n't expect to find God by staring into my belly button . But it does work . . . and it 's better than forcing your body with drugs . Now let Winnie and me help you into bed . " " 1 can manage . " " Of course you can but I do n't want the relaxation to wear off . Indulge me , Jake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let them  --  slid onto the opened bed , let them cover him , smiled again when Joan Eunice gave him a motherly good-night kiss , seemed unsurprised when Winifred followed her mistress 's example -- turned on his side and was asleep as the girls left the room . " Do n't bother , " Joan said as Winifred started to put on her negligee . " It 's my house and no one comes upstairs after dinner unless sent for . Except Hubert and I assume that Jake sent him to bed , knowing that he was to be called on by two tarts in three quarter time and not much else . " She slid an arm around the redhead 's slender waist . " Winnie , much as I like to dress up -- is n't it nice to wear just skin ? " " I like it . Indoors . Not outdoors , l sunburn so badly . " " What about at night ? When I was a boy , ages and ages ago , it got unbearably hot in July and August where we lived  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bake ovens even at night -- no air-condi/tioning . An electric fan was a luxury most people did not have . Nights when I could n't sleep because of heat 1 used to sneak quiet as a mouse and bare as a frog out the back door , being oh so careful not to let my parents hear , and walk naked in the dark , with grass cool on my feet and the soft night breeze velvet on my skin . Heavenly ! " " It sounds heavenly . But I would be terrified of getting mugged . " " The word mug ' had n't been invented , much less any fear of it . I was a middle-aged man before I became wary of the dark . " They turned into the master bedroom . " Kiss me good-night , Winsome , and go keep your date . Sleep late in the morning ; I 'm going to . " " Uh , my date is n't until after midnight . Are n't you going to tell me what happened today ? " " Why , of course , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a bath with me ? " " If you want me to . I bathed after dinner . " " And you have your face on for your date . I bathed this morning but it seems a week ago . Sniff me and tell me how badly I stink . " " You smell all right . Luscious . " " Then I 'll let it go with toothbrush and bidet and a swipe at my armpits ; I 'd rather go to bed . " " You have n't had dinner . " " Not all that hungry . Just happy . Is there milk in my bedroom fridge ? Milk and crackers is all I want . Want to join me with a glass for yourself and get crumbs in bed and talk girl talk ? Things I ca n't mention to dear Jake now that I 'm a girl and not mean , old , cantankerous Johann . " " Joanie , I do n't believe you ever were cantankerous . " " Oh , yes , I was , hon. I hurt most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't fit to live with . But Joan Eunice is never depressed ; her bowels are too regular . Scrounge us two glasses of milk and a box of crackers while I take a pretend bath . Do n't go downstairs ; there will be something over there in the iron rations . Fig newtons , maybe , or vanilla wafers . " Soon they were sitting , munching , in the big bed while Joan Eunice gave an edited account of the day : "  --  so we visited in Judge Mac 's chambers and let the car go ahead , as Judge Mac the sweet darling would n't hear of my leaving through the streets . Even though the phony riot was over . Then we switched from copter to car at Safe Harbor and came home . " ( Protecting her innocence , ' twin ? ) ( Not bloody likely . Protecting Jake 's reputation. )  | " But the best part of the day was when I took off that street robe and let ' em look at the Acapulco outfit you dressed me in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ape ? ,  --  " Out-of-date slang . They dropped one wing and ran in circles , like a rooster about to tread a strange hen . " " It was n't the outfit , it was you . " " Both . Eunice Branca had a heavenly body and I 'm doing my best to justify it . With your help . As may be , both those darling men kissed me the nearest thing to rape I 've encountered . " " Better than Dr. Garcia ? " " I do n't think Dr. Garcia gave me his all-out best . I think he was inhibited by surprise and by the presence of a redheaded nurse I could name . But these two were n't inhibited and had a couple of drinks in them and each was doing his darnedest to do better than the other one . Whew ! Winnie , I do not exaggerate  --  if Jake had n't been there , I think they would have had me down on the rug for a gang bang in two seconds . " " Uh . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truthful , tart ? ) ( Who taught me to be a tart ? Any reason not to tell her , Eunice ? ) ( None . Except that she 's likely to rape you herself . ) ( Oh , pooh , she 's just killing time till her date . ) ( Do n't say I did n't warn you . ) " Winnie , if I were a real lady , I would be horrified . But I wo n't pretend with my chum . I do n't know much about being female but I seem to have strong instincts . Cross my heart , if either of those sweet men had given me a gentle shove , I would have landed on that rug with my legs open and eyes closed . Gang bang ? By then I felt ready to take on a regiment . " Winifred said thoughtfully , " It happened to me once . " " A regiment ? " " No . A gang bang . " " Well , Let 's shoo the crumbs out of bed and squeeze down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they mean to you ? " " Not really . Oh , dear , I 'm blushing already . Turn off everything but one floor light and let me tell it against your neck . " " That better ? " " Yes . " " Now tell Mama . " " Uh , it was the night I graduated from training . I was n't a virgin  --  I 'm not sure there was a virgin in my class . But this was something else . Some interns gave a party for some of us . That was fine and I expected one of them to get me alone . Interns are the horniest people and a girl didn'tp197accept a date with one unless she meant business . But the party was loads of champagne and no food . Joan , I had never had champagne before . " " Oho ! I can write the ending . " " Well . . . champagne does n't taste strong . I sopped up a lot of it. " ' then I was in bed and it was happening . Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vague . I noticed that he was n't dark-haired after all ; he had hair as red as mine . When I had been certain that he was dark-haired and had a mustache . When I noticed later that he was almost bald , I realized that something odd was going on . Joan , there were seven interns at that party . I think all of them had me before morning . I do n't know how many times . I knew what was happening after thick , curly red hair was replaced by mostly bald . But I did n't try to stop it . Uh . . . I did n't want it to stop . A nympho , huh ? " " I do n't know , dear , but that 's the way I felt late this afternoon . Wanted it to happen at last , wanted it to go on happening  --  and I do n't even know what it feels like . Go on . " " Well , it did go on . I got up once and went to the bathroom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stitch on and could n't remember having undressed . Did n't seem to matter . I went back to bed , and found that I was feeling lonely ; the party seemed to have stopped . " Only it had n't . A man came in and I managed to focus my eyes and kind , Oh , Ted ! Come here . ' And he did and we did , and it was worse than ever . " I woke up about noon with a dreadful hangover . Managed to sit up and here were my clothes , neatly folded on a chair , and on the bedside table a tray with a thermos of coffee and some Danish pastry and a glass with a note by it . It read : Drink this before you eat . You 'll need it . Chubby . ' Chubby was the one who was almost bald . " " A gentleman . Aside from his taste for mass rape . " " ( ' hubby was always nice . But if anybody had told me that I would ever be in bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Were you ever again ? " " Oh , yes . I really did appreciate the thoughtful little breakfast and especially the hangover cure . It put me back together . Not good enough to go on watch but good enough to get dressed and back to my room . " Were you all right ? I mean , uh , not caught or anything ? " " Not even sore . Not anything . Was n't my time , even if I had n't been protected with an implant , which I was . And one nice thing about going to lied with interns , almost no chance of picking up an infection . No , I was lucky all the way , Joan . Oh , no doubt the story went the rounds  --  but Ip198was n't the only graduate getting it that night , and that was n't the only party . Nobody teased me about it . But it was a gang bang , and I did n't make the slightest move to stop it . " She added thoughtfully , " The thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know I would . So I do n't drink at all anymore . I know I ca n't handle it . " " Why , Winnie , you 've had a drink with me , more than once . " " That 's not the same thing . Uh , if you wanted me to get drunk with you  --  I would . I 'd be safe . " ( Safe ! Little does she know . ) ( Eunice , we have n't done more than snuggle and you know it . ) ( She 's asking you to step up the pace . ) ( Well , I wo n't ! Not much , anyhow . ) " Winnie ! Winnie dear ! Look at the time . " " Uh ? Oh , my heavens ! Ten minutes after midnight . I  --  " The little redhead seemed about to cry . " Are you late ? He 'll wait . Oh , I 'm sure he will  --  for Winnie . " " Not late yet . He 's off duty at midnight and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dear , I do n't want to leave you . Not when we were  --  I was , anyhow  --  so happy . " " Me , too , darling , " Joan agreed , gently untangling herself from Winifred'sarms . " But big sister is always here . Do n't keep your man waiting . Check your lipstick and hair and such in my bath if there is any chance that he may already be in your room . " " Well . All right . Miss Joan , you 're good to me . " " Do n't you dare call me Miss ' at a time like this or swelp me , I 'll make you miss your date . Rush , rush , hon ; go get beautiful . Kiss me good-night ; I 'll be asleep before you are out of the bath . And , Winsome  --  no exercises tomorrow . " " But  --  " " Smile , I did n't break your dolly . I want to sleep late and I want you to sleep late so that I wo n't wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the classic postures you need in bed tonight . Stop blushing . Give him something special from me , only do n't tell him . Or do , I do n't give a darn . Kiss me quick and let me go to sleep . " Her maid-chum-nurse kissed her not too quickly and left hurriedly . Joan Eunice pretended to be asleep when Winifred walked silently from the bath through the room , on into her own room , and the door sealed behind her . ( Well , twin , you lucked through again , did n't you ? ) ( Eunice , I 've told you time and again that I am not going to stroll Gay Street while I 'm ap199virgin . Might be habit-forming . ) ( Could be , with our cuddly little pet who enjoys a gang bang . But I did n't mean her . I meant at Safe Harbor . ) ( You call that luck ? 1 call it the most frustrating thing that ever happened to me . Eunice , I needed the Money Hum as badly as Jake did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I may be dead but I can still read a calendar . I was steady on twenty-eight-and-a-half days for more than ten years  --  and we 've still been on it since we amalgamated . We 're fertile as a turtle , Myrtle , this minute  --  and will be , for two or three days . Jake has promised you that the next tune wo n't be frustrating . . . and you 'll be as carefree as a cheerleader I told you about . Scan me , Fanny ? So run do n't walk and get that implant  --  about ten o'clock tomorrow morning . Unless you plan to get us benched right away . Do you ? ) ( Eunice , you 're talking non  --  No , you 're not . I will do something about it . Tomorrow . But benched right away ' is an exaggeration . I 'm new at this while you 've been through one pregnancy . But your aunt probably watched you like a hawk  --  ) ( She did . Elsie Dinsmore had a livelier time. ) ( but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benched ' is just a short time , at the end . And pregnancy does n't kill a woman 's interest . My angelic first wife , Agnes , would have tried it on the way to the hospital if I had n't had more sense about it than she had . Just the same , I 'll be good . I 'll be careful , rather . ) ( Joan , I was n't trying to talk you out of it . I just did n't want us knocked up by accident . Say through a playful romp with Judgie Wudgie . Or Alec . But if you want to , that 's fine . Marry Jake and get pregnant at once . Or get pregnant by him and then marry him ; he might be more tractable . ) ( Eunice , I 'm not planning on getting married in any hurry if at all . ) ( So ? I 've heard you propose to Jake at least four times . ) ( Yes , yes ! If Jake agreed , I would ; I would n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until these legal finagles are cleared up . Which might take years . Do you remember how long it took to get the courts to okay the Sky Trails stock conversions ? That was clear-cut compared with this and ( lid not involve as much money . Eunice , I propose to Jake for his morale ; I do n't care whether he makes an honest woman ' of me or not , I just want him to take us to bed . Marriage does n't figure . ) ( Twin , your naivete surprises me . Did n't you hear Winnie ? Marriage is n't planned , it just happens . No girl is more likely to wind up in a hotel room , married to a man she did n't even know at sundown the night before , than a chick who is n't going to get married any time soon . ' Boss , you marry Jake . Marry him as soon as he will agree to it  --  for you were talking sensep200when you pointed out that no other man could both understand you and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's smart to go contra . ) ( All right . What are the girls using today ? ) ( Oh , most of them use implants . Some use pills , both the daily ones and the monthly ones . But if you miss with either sort , you are on a very short fuse . I never liked monkeying with my body 's economy ; I 'm not convinced that anything that changes a woman 's femaleness that much is a good idea . Not superstition , Boss , I did some careful reading after the time I got caught . There are hazards to all chemical methods . My body worked fine the way it was ; I did n't want to tamper with a successful organization  --  I 'm quoting you , only you were talking about business . ) ( I see your point , Eunice , even though we 're talking about monkey business . A body is far more complex than a corporation , and the one you turned over to me is a jewel ; I do n't want to tamper with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Self-restraint ? ) ( Never had any in stock , dearie . Oh , there are lots of other loving things you can do without getting pregnant  --  if you can shake off your early training and be twenty-first century  --  ) ( Look , infant , I knew about  --  and used  --  every one of those other things in high school . I keep telling you : You kids did not invent sex . ) ( You did n't let me finish , Boss . Those are emergency measures . A girl who depends on them alone is going to add to the population explosion . Joan , I looked into it carefully , when I turned eighteen and was licensed . . . and settled on one of the oldest methods . A diaphragm . They are still available ; any physician will fit them . I wore one six days every month , even at the office  --  because , as the doctor who fitted me pointed out , most diaphragm failures result from leaving them at home while you run out for a pound of sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right , Eunice . ) ( I 'm sure of it , Joan . I never liked them  --  I never liked any contraception ; I seemed to have a deep instinct that told me to get pregnant . Boss . . . the thing -- the only thing  --  that I really mind about being dead . . . is that I always wanted to have a baby by you . And that 's silly , as you were already too old -- or maybe almost too old  --  when I first met you . But I would.have tried , if you had offered . ) ( Darling , darling ! ) ( Oh , I 'm happy with what I have . Om Mani Padme Hum . I 'm not kicking about my karma . I 'm not just content , I 'm happy . . . to be half of Joan Eunice . ) ( Eunice , would you still be willing to have a baby by me ? ) ( What ? Boss , do n't joke about it . Do n't mock me . ) ( I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessary part of you is gone . Pickled in alcohol , or something . ) ( They use formalin , I think . Or deep freeze . I 'm not talking about that old wreck we discarded . We can go down and get an implant . ) ( Huh ? I do n't understand . ) ( Do you remember a tax-deductible called the Johanna Mueller Schmidt Memorial Eugenics Foundation ? ) ( Of course . I wrote a check for it every quarter . ) ( Eunice , despite the purposes set out in its charter , the only real purpose does not appear in the fine print . When my son was killed I was already fairly old . But I was still virile  --  potent  --  and tests showed that I was fertile . So I got married  --  I think I told you  --  to have another son . Did n't work . But I had my bet hedged and never told anyone . Sperm bank deposit . In the cryogenic vault of the Foundation is a little piece of Johann . Hundreds of millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not dead , just asleep . That 's what I meant by an implant . With a syringe . Or however they do it . ( Eunice ? Are you still there ? ) ( I 'm crying , Boss . Ca n't a girl cry happy ? Yes ! ) ( Tomorrow morning , then . You can change your mind up till the last minute . ) ( I 'll never change my mind . I hope you wo n't . ) ( Beloved. )  |p202Next  morning Joan found that Jake had left the house . before she woke ; there was a note on her tray : " Dear Joan Eunice , I slept like a baby and feel ready to fight wildcats  --  thanks to you and Winnie . Please extend my thanks to her and say ( to both of you ) that I will most gratefully join your prayer meetings any time I am invited  --  especially if I 've had a tiring day . " I will not be back until late  --  treasure hunting , locating links of evidence . Alec is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , call my answering service or Judge Mc Campbell 's chambers . " I 've instructed Jefferson Billings to let you draw against your petty expenditures account  --  about four hundred thousand in it , I believe  --  on your old signature and new thumbprint . He 'll pay drafts and hold them and I 'll " - countersign until you make out a new signature &; thumbprint card  --  he says he knew Eunice Branca by sight , no problem . If you wish , he will call on you with a new sig-print card-we assume that your signature is now somewhat changed . " ( Boss , I guess Jake does n't know that I sign your signature better than you do . ) ( I do n't think anyone knows , dearest . I do n't know how that would figure in court  --  for us , or against us ? ) " If you need more pocket money , let me make you a personal loan rather than have it show in my conservator 's report . Your ' Brother Mac ' is most helpful , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such time as he can , with full justification , relieve me as your conservator . Caesar 's wife , you know . " Speaking of Caesar 's wife , I told you a chuckle about two of our friends . This morning I phoned one of them and the other answered and , after the usual query as to sight &; sound security , they seemed unworried about what I saw or heard or might infer . I was flattered . Little imp , if youp203must misbehave , you can trust them  --  for they have your welfare at heart . Sorry I was stuffy yesterday . " ( I 'm glad to learn that , Boss . ) ( Eunice , I ca n't see that it 's our business what Alec and Mac do in their spare time . Jake should n't gossip about them , even to us . ) ( No , no , Boss ! Jake is telling you that he was being a cube yesterday  --  and he 's sorry  --  and now he 's granting you absolution in advance . We had best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he jealous . Possessive . His age , his background . Could be doom , twin  --  as you are a tart at heart and we both know it . ) ( Ott , nonsense , Eunice ! I would never rub Jake 's nose in it  --  and anyhow you 're wrong . A smart man  --  which Jake is  --  does n't get excited over a go cm the tiles ; what worries him is fear of losing a wife he values . If Jake mantes us , I will never let him worry about losing us . ) ( I hope you can make that stick , Boss honey . ) ( With your help I 'm sure I can . Let 's finish his letter  --  ) " Do n't count on me for dinner , as what I must do today is urgent  --  more Went than something that seemed dreadfully urgent yesterday . And was . And will be , I hope . " This was meant to be a love letter but I 've had to mention other matters and other people , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it flown the W.C. It is no accident that I am thumbprinting the seal and will hand it to Cunningham with a promise to have his head on a platter if it bares his person before it reaches you . I 've learned to like Cunningham ; hr ' c an ' honest thief " AN love to you , dearest , and the biggest kiss possible  --  so big that you sun break off a piece and deliver it to Winnie when you thank her for me . Mea charming girl , and I 'm pleased that she 's mothering you so well . " J. " ( Why , the horny old bastard . Joan , Jake has his eye on Winnie 's pretty lad while he 's patting ours . ) ( She 'll have to stand in line ! ) ( Jealous , twin ? ) ( No /tilt I repeat -- 1 'm going to scalp him first . Darn it , Eunice , I had him all set yesterday  --  and it 's been a long struggle . Not the **25;11332;TOOLONG managed with him . And all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes home tonight . ) ( Three hurdles even if he does , swill ) ( three ? ) ( Hubert ... and Winnie . . . and that implant . ' Boss dar/ling ? You 're not going to do me out of having your baby by letting Jake get at you first  --  are you ? ) ( Of course not , little stupid . I was coping with intrigues without getting shot long before your grandmother was born . Mmm  --  I 'll need cash . ) ( Jake told you how to get all the cash you want . ) ( Oh , sure  --  on my signature and his countersignature . Like a cat covering up on linoleum . Eunice my love , I 'll bet you never paid a bribe in your life . ) ( Well .... not with money . ) ( Do n't tell me , let me guess . Hon , what we 're sitting on might be worth a million  --  but today I need used bills in medium denominations from no recorded source . Come along , little snoopy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary  --  a sweetly deceitful girl named Eunice , remember her ?  --  did n't know about . ) ( Do you mean that safe hidden in your bath , Boss ? ) ( Huh ? How the hell did you know about that ? ) ( I 'm snoopy . ) ( Do you know the combo ? ) ( I ought to take the Fifth . ) ( Why bother ? You 'll know it in two minutes . Or can you pick it out of my mind ? ) ( Boss darling , you know by now that I do n't know anything in your memory until you think about it ... and you do n't know anything in mine until I think about it . But  --  Well , if I had to open that safe , I think I would start with the numbers that mean your mother 's birthday . ) Joan sighed . ( A girl does n't have any privacy these days . All right , let 's see if we 've been robbed . ) She went into her bath , sealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stack of towels from a lower cabinet , fiddled with the ceiling of the cabinet ; the back panel slid aside , disclosing a safe . ( You think my mother 's birth date will open it ? ) ( I 'd switch on the sun lamps over the massage table first , then run the cold water in the hand basin . ) ( No privacy at all ! Honey , did you really pay a bribe with your pretty tail once ? ) ( Not exactly . I just improved the situation . Let 's see if we 've been robbed . ) Joan opened the safe . Inside was money enough to interest a bank auditor . But the packets had not been packaged in a bank ; they were not that neatly jogged and the total for each was hand-printed . ( Plenty of moola , dear  --  and either nobody found this safe , or they never figured out the additional bolts . Either way , it settles one thing . We wo n't put Jake 's sweet note down the hopper . ) ( Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asks . ) ( Then cry on him later and admit that we could n't bear to part with it . ) ( Eunice , you have a mind like a pretzel . ) ( That 's why it fits so well into yours , twin . ) ( Could be . ) Joan put the letter inside , took out two packets , put them into a purse in the dressing room end  --  closed the safe , shut off the sun lamps , shut off thep205water , spun the dial , slid the panel back , replaced the towels , closed the cabinet . Then she stepped to the bath 's intercom , pressed a touchplate . " Chief O'Neil . " " Yes , Miss Smith ? " " I want my car , one driver , and both Shotguns in thirty minutes . " There was a short silence . " Uh , Miss Smith . Mr. Salomon apparently forgot to mention that you would be leaving the house . " " For excellent reason . He did not know it . Did he mention that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If not , have you learned it from some other source ? " " Miss , I have n't learned it from an official source . " " I sec . Then you are learning it from me . Officially . " " Yes , Miss . " ' Noll do n't sound happy , O'Neil . You could check by phoning Judge Mt Campbell . " " Wily , yes , of course . " " Are you going to , O'Neil ? " " Perhaps I misunderstood , Miss . Were n't you telling me to ? " " Are you recording ? " Certainly , Miss . I always do , with orders . " " I suggest that you play it back and answer your own question . I 'll hold . But first-how long have you been with me , O'Neil ? " " Seventeen years , Miss . The last nine as your Chief . " " Seventeen years , two months , and some days . Not enough for maxi-m retirement but it has been long , faithful , and unquestioning service . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you wish , O'Neil ; faithful service should be appreciated . Now please play back while I hold . " She waited . " Be switched , Miss  --  I must need a hearing aid . You did n't tell me to call the Judge . You just said I could . " " That is correct . I pointed out that you could check on what I told you officially by making such a call . You still can . " " Uh , Miss , I do n't see what you are driving at . " " I 'm sure you can figure it out . Do you wish to retire today ? If so , send Mentone ; I want to interview him . " " Miss I 've no wish to retire at all . " " Really ? You gave the impression that you were looking for another job . Perhaps with Mr. Salomon . If so , I do not want to stand in your way . Retirement at full pay is available to you , O'Neil . " " Miss I like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I hope you will stay for many years . O'Neil , have you ever discussed my comings and goings with anyone ? " " Only when you 've told me to , Miss . In which case I always have your order on tape . " " Fine . Wipe this tape and I 'll hold while you do so . " Shortly he said , " Wiped , Miss Smith . " " Good . Let 's start over . Chief O'Neil , this is Miss Johann Sebastian Bach Smith speaking . I want my car , one driver , and both Shotguns in thirty minutes . " " They will be ready , Miss Smith . " " Thank you . I 'll be shopping . Is there anything I can pick up for Mrs. O'Neil ? " " That 's most kind of you , Miss . I do n't think so . Shall I ask her ? " " If you do , it is only necessary to say that my car is going out . If she has a list , I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Off . " ( Boss , you scared the pee out of him . Was that nice ? ) ( Running a feudal enclave in the midst of a nominal democracy is n't easy , Eunice . When Johann said Frog , ' everybody hopped  --  my security boss especially . O'Neil has got to know  --  they 've all got to know  --  that Johann is still here . . . and that no one , not even darling Jake , reviews or vetoes what I say . Unless he marries us , in which case I 'll go female and let him decide everything . ) ( That 'll be the day ! ) ( I might , dear one . Tell me , did you obey Joe ? ) ( Well ... I never bucked him . I suppose you could say I obeyed him . Except that I fibbed , or sometimes kept my mouth shut . ) ( I 'd do just about the same . I think a perfect arrangement would be to do exactly what a man tells me to do . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what I 've already decided to do . ) Joan felt , rather than heard , her chuckle . ( Boss , that sounds like a recipe for a perfect marriage . ) ( I find I like being female . But it 's different . Now what shall we wear ? ) Joan settled on a bandeau , a knee skirt , an opaque cloak with hood and yashmak , plus low-heeled sandals , all in subdued colors . She was ready in less than thirty minutes . ( How 's our face , Eunice ? ) ( Okay for a shopping ' trip . No need to call Winnie ; the little baggage probably has n't had much sleep . ) ( Nor do I want to call her ; she might want to come along . Let 's go , sweet  --  we 're out to break a two-thousand-year record with no help from the Holy Ghost . ) ( Boss , that 's not a nice way to talk ! ) ( Well , I 'll be frimped ! Eunice , I thought you were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such . ) ( I 'm not any of those things , Boss . I simply know some useful spiritualp207disciplines . But it is rude to joke about anything someone else holds holy . ) ( Even in my mind ? Are you telling me what I must not think ? If I could reach you , I 'd spank you . ) ( Oh , you can say anything to me , Boss  --  just do n't say such things out loud . ) ( I did n't and do n't and never have . Quit nagging me . ) ( Sorry , Boss . Love you . ) ( Love you , little nag . Let 's go get knocked up . ) ( Yes ! ) She took the front lift to the basement ; O'Neil met her and saluted . " Car is ready , Miss -- and both drivers and both Shotguns . " " Why both drivers ? " " Well , Finchley should be on call . But Dabrowski is bucking my authority a touch . Claims he 's senior to Finchley . Do you wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must . But perhaps I can smooth some feathers . " " Yes , Miss . " He conducted her to her car ; both teams were lined up by it , they saluted in unison . She smiled at them . " Good morning , friends . I 'm glad to see you all looking so well . It 's been a long time . " Dabrowski answered for them , " It has indeed , Miss Smith  --  and we are glad to see you looking so well . " " Thank you . " Her eyes traveled across them . " There is one thing no one has told me . . . about the tragedy that started this strange sequence of events . Which team was driving the night Mrs. Branca was killed ? " For a long moment no one spoke . Then O'Neil answered , " Finchley and Shorty had the duty that night , Miss Smith . " " Then I must thank them -- for Mrs. Branca and for myself . Although I know that Dabrowski and Fred would have acted as bravely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Shorty , her face unsmiling but serene . " Which one of you avenged Eunice ? Or was it both of you ? " Finchley answered . " Shorty got him , Mrs.  --  Miss Smith . Bare hands , one chop . Broke his neck . " She turned to Shorty  --  six feet six of smooth-black soul , two hundred ninety pounds of sudden death -- and a preacher in his time off . She looked up at hun and said gently , " Shorty , from the bottom of my heart  --  for Eunice Branca -- I thank you . " ( I do thank him , Boss ! This is news to me . I was dead before that lift opened . ) " If she were here , she would thank you  --  not just for herself but for other girls that killer will never kill . I 'm glad you killed him in the act . If he had gone to trial , he might be out by now . Doing it again . " Shorty had said nothing up to then . " Miss  --  Finch got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rightly say which one got him first . "  | " Nor does it matter . Any of you four would have protected Mrs. Branca with your life . She knew it  --  and knows it , wherever she is . I know it , and Chief O'Neil knows it . " Joan felt tears start , let them flow . " I  --  all of us ! just wish to Heaven she had waited indoors until you two arrived . I know that each of you would rather see me dead than her . I ask you to do me the honor of believing that I feel the same way . Shorty , will you say a prayer for her tonight ? For me ? I do n't know much about praying . " ( Damn it , Boss , you 've got me crying . ) ( Then say a Money Hum . For Shorty . He 's still blaming himself for the unavoidable . ) " I will , Miss . I have every night . Although  --  Mrs. Branca  --  does n't need it . She went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boss . Though not the way Shorty thinks . ) ( And we sha n't tell him . Have I said enough ? ) ( I think so . ) Joan said , " Thank you , Shorty . For me , not for Eunice . As you say , Eunice does n't really need prayers . " She turned to O'Neil . " Chief , I want to go to Gimbel 's Compound . " " Certainly , Miss . Uh , Finchley , man the car . Both Shotguns . " O'Neil helped her in , locked her in ; she locked herself in . The armor door lifted and the big car rolled out into the street . ( Joan , what in the world are you going to buy at Gimbel 's ? ) ( A gag . For you . I 'll change that order in a moment . Eunice , where did you buy clothes ? You were the most smartly dressed gal in town  --  even when you were the nakedest . ) ( Pooh , I was never naked ; Joe 's designs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should never shop . ) ( Ca n't see why not . ) ( Johann might but you ca n't ; it would n't do . Mmm . . . while I could not afford the stylish places , I know of them . Come to think of it , two of them lease space inside Gimbel 's Compound . ) ( So that 's where we 'll go  --  second . I 'll tell Finchley the change ... and tell him to have Fred escort me ; I think Fred feels left out . ) ( Wups ! Fred can read . ) ( So ? Oh ! Well , Fred can guard me later . ) She thumbed the order switch . " Finchley . " " Yes , Miss ? " " I got so preoccupied that I forgot one other stop . Please drop Shorty and me at the unloading zone where State passes over Main . " " State and Main , Miss . " " Please have Shorty hang the radio link on his belt ; there 's no parking around there . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long has that been ? Over two years . " " Two years and seven months , Miss . Sure you do n't want both Shotguns with you ? "  | " No , they can take turns staying with the car . If you have to get out , I want you covered . " " Oh , I 'll be all right , Miss . " " Do n't argue with me . You would n't have argued when I was old Johann Smith ; I assure you that Miss Johann Smith still has his poison fangs . Pass the word along . " She heard him chuckle . " I 'll do that , Miss Smith . " When the car stopped , Joan hooked up her yashmak , concealing her identity  --  either or both of them  --  from the curious . Shorty unlocked her and handed her out . On the crowded pedestrian walk of Main Street Joan felt suddenly vulnerable ... except for the tower of strength beside her . " Shorty , the building I 'm looking for is in the thirteen hundred blockthirteen-oh-seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make him feel useful ; she knew where the Roberts Building was , she owned it . " Oh , sure , Miss  --  I read numbers real good . Letters , too just words bother me . " " Let 's go then . Shorty , how do you manage in your real profession ? Not being able to read the Bible , I mean . " " No trouble , I use talking books  --  and as for the Book , I got every precious word memorized . " " A remarkable memory . I wish I could say the same . " " Just takes patience . I had the Book down pat while I was still in prison . " He added thoughtfully , " Sometimes I think I ought to learn to read ... but I ca n't seem to find time . " ( The poor dear probably never had a teacher who could teach , Boss . ) ( Never tamper with a successful organization , Eunice ; he 's found his niche . ) " This must be it , Miss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thank you , Shorty . " She was not asked for her I.D . at the building entrance , nor did she offer it , for she had none , either as Johann Smith or Eunice Branca . The guard noted the " Licensed &; Deputized " shield ( which matched his own ) on Shorty 's uniform , released the cage turnstile , and waved them on through . Joan Eunice smiled at him with her eyes  --  and made note that security at the Roberts Building should be tightened ; the guard should have photographed Shorty 's I.D . and logged his shield number . ( Boss , he ca n't handle so many people that way ; he has to use his judgment . ) ( Look who 's talking ! If that apartment house you used to live in had had tight security , you would never have been mugged . If we ca n't stop violence outdoors , we must try to keep it from coming indoors . ) ( I wo n't argue , Boss darling  --  I 'm excited ! ) ( Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelfth floor they went to the suite occupied by the Johanna Mueller Schmidt Memorial Eugenics Foundation , H. S. Olsen , M.D. , Sc.D. , Director , Please Ring and Wait . The guard let them in , went back to his picture magazine . Joan noted with approval that there was a goodly number of women and couples in the waiting room . She ( Johann ) had jacked up Olsen about the ( public ) purpose of the Foundation  --  to offer superior anonymous donors to licensed and qualified females  --  in her last letter accompanying a quarterly check ; apparently it had had good effect . " Wait here , Shorty ; there 's video over there . " She went to the barrier desk separating the waiting room from the outer clerical office , avoided the sign " Applications " and got the reluctant attention of the only male back of the barrier , motioned him to her . " What is it , Ma'am ? If it 's an application , go to the far end , present your I.D . and fill out the questionnaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I want to see the Director . Dr. Olsen . " " Dr. Olsen never sees anyone without an appointment . Give me your name and state your business and possibly his secretary will see you . " She leaned closer , spoke softly . " I must see him . Tell him that my husband has found out . " The office manager looked startled . " Your name ? " " Do n't be silly . Just tell him that . " " Uh . . . wait here . " He disappeared through a rear door . She waited . After a remarkably short time he appeared at a side door of the waiting room , motioned her to him , then conducted her down a passage toward a door marked " Director  --  Keep Out " and to a door near it marked " Secretary to the Director , Ring &; Wait . " There he left her with a woman who reminded Joan of Johann 's third-grade teacher , both in appearance and authoritarian manner . The woman said frostily , " What is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ( Three fingers stiff into her solar plexus , Boss , and say she fainted ! ) ( Maybe . We 'll try my way first . ) Joan answered in still more frozen tones , " Not likely , Miss Perkins . Why do you think I 'm veiled ? Will you announce me ? Or do I call the police and the news snoops ? " Miss Perkins looked startled , left her stenodesk , and entered the private office behind it . She came out shortly and said angrily , " You may go in . " Olsen did not get up as Joan entered . He said , " Madam , you have chosen an unusual way of getting my attention . Now what is it ? Come to the point . "  | " Doctor , do n't you offer chairs to ladies ? " " Certainly . If they are ladies . A point you have gone to some trouble to render dubious . Speak up , my good woman , or I shall have you removed . " ( Boss , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bat in the next room it taking down every word . ) ( So I assumed , Eunice . So we wo n't talk yet. ) loan stepped close to the Doctor 's desk , unhooked her yashmak , let it fall to her left shoulder . I he Doctor 's expression changed from annoyance to startled recognition . Joan Eunice leaned across his desk , flipped off the dictation microphone . Then she said quietly , " Anything else still recording ? Is this loom soundproof ? How about that door ? " " Miss " ' Miss ' is enough . Are you ready to ask me to sit down ? Or shall I leave and return with my lawyer ? " " Do please sit down  --  Miss . " ' Thank you . " Joan waited until he got up and moved a chair to a correct " honored-guest " position near his own . She sat down . " Now answer the rest . Are we truly private ? If we are not  --  and you tell inc that we are  --  I will eventually know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I deem appropriate . " " Uh , we 're private . But just a moment . " He got up , went to his secretary 's door , bolted it manually . " Now , Miss , please tell me what this Is about . " " I shall . First , I 've been supplementing my original endowment with quarterly checks . Have you been receiving these during my incapacita-tion ? " " Eh ... one check failed to arrive . I waited six weeks , then wrote to Mr. Salomon and explained what your custom had been . It seems he checked the facts , for soon after we received two quarterly payments at once , with a letter saying that he would continue to authorize payments in accordance with your custom . Is there some difficulty ? " " No , Doctor . The Foundation will continue to receive my support . Let me add that the trustees are  --  on the whole  --  satisfied with your manage-ment . " " " That 's pleasing to hear . Is that why you came today ? To tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to the purpose . Are you quite certain that our pi iv:icy can not be breached ? Let me add that the answer is far more important to you than it is to me . " " Miss , uh Miss , I am certain . "  | " Good . I want you to go into the cold vault , obtain donation 551-20-0052  --  I will go with you and check the number  --  and then I want you to impregnate me with it . At once . " The Doctor 's face broke in astonishment . Then he regained his professionalaplomb and said , " Miss  --  that is impossible . " " Why ? The purpose of our institution , as defined in its charter  --  which I wrote  --  is to supply qualified females with donor sperm  --  on request , without fee , and without publicity . That 's exactly what I want . If you wish to give me a physical examination , I 'm ready . If you want to know whether or not this body is licensed for child-bearing , I assure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this case , a fine for unlicensed pregnancy means less than nothing . What 's the trouble ? Does it take too long to prepare the sperm to do it all in one day ? " " Oh , no , we can have it warmed and viable in thirty minutes . " " Then impregnate me thirty minutes from now . " " But , Miss  --  do you realize the trouble I could get into ' ? " " What trouble ? " " Well . . . I do follow the news . Or I would not have recognized you . I understand that there is a question of identity  --  " " Oh , that . " Joan dismissed it . " Doctor , do you bet on the races ? " " Eh ? I 've been known to . Why ? " " If we are truly private , you ca n't possibly get into trouble . But there comes a time in every man 's life when he must bet . You are at such a crisis . You can bet on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hedge your bet . And win . Or lose . As you know , the other trustees of this corporation are my dummies ; I am the Foundation . Let me predict what will come to pass . Presently this identity nonsense will be over and the real Johann Sebastian Bach Smith will stand up . At that time the endowment of this institution will be doubled . At that same time the salary of the Director will be doubled . If you bet on the right horse , you will be the Director . If not  --  you 'll be out of a job . " " You 're threatening me ! " " No . Prophesying . Old Johann Sebastian Bach Smith was a seventh son of a seventh son , born under a caul ; he had the gift of prophecy . No matter which way you bet , the endowment will be doubled . But only you and I will ever know what is done today . " " Mmmm . . . there are procedures to satisfy . I do have authority to permit any adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she qualifies  --  and let 's say that I am . Nevertheless there are routines to go through , records that must be kept . "  |p213(He  's ready to geek , Boss . So sing him a Money Hum , with a different tune . ) ( Eunice , a cash bribe is to push him over if he wo n't fall . Let 's see if Irr 'll sell it to himself. ) loan shook her head . " No records . Just do it to me and I 'll hook my veil over my face and leave . " " But , Miss  --  I do n't do these things myself . A staff doctor carries out the donation procedure , assisted by a nurse . They would think it strange if no records were kept . Very . " " No nurses . No assistants . You alone , Doctor . You are an M.D. and a specialist in genetics and eugenics . Either you can do this . . . or you do n't know enough to head this institution  --  which the trustees would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and check the number on that donation . and stick at your elbow until you place it inside me . Do we understand each other ? " Hie Doctor sighed . " I once thought a general practice was hard work ! We ca n't be sure that a placed donation will result in impregnation . " " If not , I 'll be back in twenty-eight and a half days . Doctor , quit stalling . or bet on the other horse and I 'll leave . No harsh words , now or later . Just that prophecy . " She stood up . ( Well , Eunice ? Will the frog hop ? ) ( Ca n't guess , dear . He 's seen so many female tails he 's bored with them . I ca n't figure him . ) Olsen suddenly stood up . " You 'll need a cold suit . " " All right . " " Plus the advantage that a cold suit covers so thoroughly that a man would not recognize his own wife in one . I have a spare here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class me as a V.I.P. , " Joan said dryly . Forty minutes later Dr. Olsen said , " Hold still a moment longer . I am placing a Dutch cap , a latex occlusive cervical pessary , over the donation . " " Why , Doctor ? I thought those things were for contraception . " " Usually . And it will serve that purpose , too  --  mean to say , some of our clients wish to be protected at once from any possibility of impregnation from any other source . But in your case my purpose in installing this temporary barrier is to make certain that the donation does impregnate you . To give those wigglers a chance to reach target and to keep them from swimming downstream instead  --  follow me ? Leave it in place until uunctime tomorrow -- or later , it does n't matter . Do you know how to remove it ? " " If I ca n't get it out , I 'll call you . " " If you wish . If you fail to skip your next menses , we can try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee supports , offered his hand . Shep214stepped down and her skirt fell into place . She felt flushed and happy . ( Eunice , it 's done ! ) ( Yes , Boss ! Beloved Boss . ) Dr. Olsen picked up her cloak , held it ready to lay around her shoulders . She said , " Doctor  --  do n't worry about that horse race . " He barely smiled . " I have not been worrying about it . May I say why ? " " Please . " " Urn . If you recall , I have met Johann Smith Mister Johann Smith on other occasions . " " Eleven occasions , I believe , sir , including a private interview when Dr. Andrews nominated you to succeed him . " " Yes , Miss Smith . I 'll never forget that interview . Miss , there may be some legal point to clear up concerning your identity . But not in my mind ! I do not think that any young woman of your present physiological age could simulate Mr. Johann Smith 's top-sergeant manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear ! " " Pardon me ? " " Dr. Olsen , this sex change I 've undergone is not easy to handle . It is fortunate  --  for both of us  --  that you were able to spot Johann Smith behind the face I now wear . But  --  darn it , sir !  --  I 've got to acquire manners to match what I am now . Will you call on me  --  oh , say three weeks from now when I hope to have cheerful news  --  and let me show you that I can simulate a lady when I try ? Come for tea . We can discuss how the Foundation 's work can be expanded under a doubled endowment . " " Miss Smith , I will be honored to call on you whenever you wish . For any reason . Or none . " ( Wups ! Hey , Eunice , I thought you said he was bored with female tails ? ) ( So 1 did . But we have an unusually pretty one , Joan , even from that angle . Gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat just one man impersonally ? ) ( I do n't know ; I 've never tried . Aw , do n't be chinchy ; he 's been a perfect lamb . ) ( Now you be a lamb , too  --  let 's get out of here . ) Joan let the doctor lay her cloak around her shoulders ; it brought his head close to hers . She turned her face toward that side , wet her lips and smiled at him . She could see him decide to risk it . She did not dodge as his lips met hers  --  but did not put her arms around him and let herself be slightly clumsy , stiffened a little before giving in to it . ( Twin ! Do n't let him put usp215hick on that table  --  make him use the couch in his office . ) ( Neither one , I ' nice . Pipe down ! ) Joan broke from it , trembling . " Thank you , Doctor . And you see I can he a girl if I try . How do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perkins ? " She hooked her yashmak.  |p216A  few minutes later Shorty handed her into her car , locked her in , and mounted into the forward compartment . " Gimbel 's Compound , Miss Smith ? " " Please , Finchley . " Once inside the compound Joan had Fred escort her to Madame Pompadour 's . The fact that she had a private bodyguard got her immediate attention from the manager , who was not Madame Pompadour even though he wore his hair in the style made famous by the notorious Marquise and had manners and gestures to match . ( Eunice , are you sure we are in the right place ? ) ( Certainly , Boss  --  wait till you see their prices . ) " How may I serve Madame ? " " Do you have a private viewing room ? " " But of course , Madame . Uh , there is a waiting room where  --  " " My guard stays with me . " The manager looked hurt . " As Madame wishes . If you will walk this way  --  " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't try , twin  --  just follow him . Or her , as the case may be . ) Shortly Joan was seated facing a low model 's walk ; Fred stood at parade rest behind her . The room was warm ; she unfrogged her cloak and pushed back its hood but left the yashmak over her features . Then she dug into her purse , got out a memorandum . " Do you have a model who comes close to these measurements ? " The manager studied the list  --  height , weight , shoulders , bust , waist , leg . " This is Madame ? " " Yes . But here is another specs list even if you ca n't match me . A friend for whom I wish to buy something pretty and exotic . She 's a redhead with pale skin to match and green eyes . " Joan had copied Winifred 's measurementsfrom the exercise records the two had been keeping . " I see no problems , Madame , but in your own case permit me to suggest that our great creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measurements or even to design directly on  --  "  | " Never mind . I am buying items already made up . If I buy . " " Madame 's pleasure . May I ask one question ? Will Madame be wearing her own hair ? " " If I wear a wig , it will be the same color as my hair , so assume that . " ( Eunice , should I buy a wig ? ) ( Be patient and let it grow out , dear . Wigs are hard to keep clean . And they never smell clean . ) ( Then we 'll never wear one . ) ( Smart Boss . Soap and water is the world 's greatest aphrodisiac . ) ( I 've always thought so . Though a girl should smell like a girl . ) ( You do , dearie , you do  --  you ca n't help it . ) " Madame 's hair is a beautiful shade . And now , since Madame indicated that her time is short , perhaps it would suit her convenience to let our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two models ? " ( Watch it , Boss ! ) ( I was n't a-hint the door , dearie . ) " I use credit cards with several names . Such as McKinley , Franklin , and Grant . Or Cleveland . " Joan reached into her purse , fanned a sheaf of bills . " The poor man 's credit card . " The manager repressed a shudder . " Oh , goodness , we do n't expect our clients to pay cash . " " I 'm old-fashioned . " The manager looked pained . " Oh , but it 's unnecessary . If Madame prefers not to use her general credit account  --  her privilege !  --  she can set up a private account with Pompadour in only moments . If she will permit me to have her I.D .  --  " " Just a moment . Can you read fine print ? " Joan pointed at a notice near a portrait of President McKinley . " This note is legal tender for all debts , public and private . ' I sha n't get tangled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Madame  --  we are n't set up for cash ! I 'm not certain we could make change . " " Well , I do n't want to put you to any inconvenience . Fred . " " Yes , Miss ? " " ' Take me to La Boutique . " The manager looked horrified . " Please , Madame ! I 'm sure something can he arranged . One moment while I speak to our accountant . " He hurried away without waiting for an answer . ( Why the fuss , Boss honey ? I 've bought endless things for you , against your personal-expenditures account . Jake said we could use it . ) ( Eunice , I 've despised those moronic machines since the first time I was trapped by a book club . But I 'm not just being balky . Today is not a day to admit who we are . Later -- after we 're out of court  --  we 'll set up a " Susan Jones "  |p218account  for shopping in person . If we ever do again . I can see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's fun ! You 'll see , twin . But , remember  --  I hold a veto until you learn something about clothes . ) ( Sho ' , sho ' , little nag . ) ( Who are you calling a nag , you knocked-up bag ? ) ( Happy about it , beloved ? ) ( Wonderfully happy , Boss . Are you ? ) ( Wonderfully . Even if it was n't romantic . ) ( Oh , but it was ! We 're going to have your baby ! ) ( Quit sniffling . ) ( I 'm not sniffling ; you are . ) ( Maybe we both are . Now shut up , here he comes . ) The manager beamed . " Madame ! Our accountant says that it is perfectly all right to accept cash ! " " The Supreme Court will be pleased to hear it . " " What ? Oh ! Madame is jesting . Of course there is a service surcharge of ten percent for  --  " " Fred . La Boutique . " " Please , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . . . and found the most wonderful solution ! " " Really ? " " Truly , Madame . Anything you choose to buy , I 'll simply charge against my personal account  --  and you can pay me cash . No trouble , I 'll be happy to . My bank does n't make the least fuss over accepting cash deposits . Really . " ( Watch it , Boss ; he 'll expect a fat tip . ) ( If he can show us something we want , he may get it . Cost is no huhu , Eunice ; we ca n't get rid of the stuff . ) ( It 's the principle of the thing , Boss . ) ( Forget it and help me spend money . ) ( All right . But we do n't buy unless we like it . ) For the next two hours Joan spent money  --  and was dazed to discover how expensive women 's clothes could be . But she suppressed her early upbringing and paid attention only to an inner voice : ( Not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't like it . ) ( How about this one , Eunice ? ) ( Maybe . Have her walk it around again , then have her sit down . Show some leg . ) ( Here comes Winnie ' again . Is that girl a real redhead , Eunice ? ) ( Probably a wig but does n't matter ; she 's almost exactly Winnie 's size : That would be cute on our Winsome . Twin , see what they have in fancy gee-strings  --  green , for a redhead . Winnie ought to have at least one outfit intended to be seen by no one but her new boy friend . ) ( Okay , we 'll give Bob ' a treat . Who do you think he is , beloved ? ) ( Have n't the faintest  --  and we do n't want to guess . Do we ? I just hope he 's nicer to her than Paul was . ) " Mr. duValle ? Do you have something exotic in a minimum-gee for a redhead ? Green , I suppose . And matching cups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present for a bride . " ( Bride ? ) ( Well , it might help Winnie become a bride , Eunice  --  and it steers him away from thinking I 'm buying it for my sweetheart . ) ( Who cares what he thinks ? ) " Jeweled perhaps ? Emeralds ? " " I would n't want a bride to be mugged over a wedding present . Nor do I wish to buy her something more expensive than her bridegroom can afford . Bad taste , I think . " " All , but these are synthetic emeralds . Just as lovely but quite reasonable . Yola dear  --  come with me . " Several thousand dollars later Joan quit . She was getting hungry and knew , from long experience , that being hungry made her unwilling to spend money . Her subconscious equated " hungry " with " poor " in a canalization it had acquired in the 1930 's . She sent Fred to fetch Shorty to help carry while her purchases were being packaged and while she paid the startling sum . ( Eunice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside this compound , Boss . ) ( Uh , darn it no , damn it !  - -  I ca n't eat through a yashmak . You know what will happen . Somebody who watched video yesterday will recognize us . Then the news snoops will be on us before you can say ' medium rare . ) ( Well .. . how about a picnic ? ) ( Wonderful ! Eunice , you win another Brownie point . But where can we go ?  --  a picnic with grass and trees and ants in the potato salad  --  but private so I can take off this veil ... and yet close enough that we wo n't starve on the way ? ) ( I do n't know , Boss , but I 'll bet Finchley does . ) Finchley did know . Shorty was appointed to buy the lunch at The I Iungry Man inside the compound  --  " Get enough for six , Shorty , and do n't look at the prices . Be lavish . But there must be potato salad . And a couple of bottles of wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't drink , wine is a mocker , and Finchley never drinks when he is on call to drive . " " Oh , think big , Shorty ; I may drink a whole bottle myself  --  you can save my soul tomorrow . Today is special  --  my first day of freedom ! " ( Very special , beloved . ) ( Very , very special , Boss ! ) Down into the crosstown chute , up onto Express Route South , out to the unlimited zone , then fifty miles at three hundred feet per second  --  a speed that Finchley did not use until Joan was protected by full harness plus collision net . The fifty miles melted away in fifteen minutes and Finchley eased it down and over , ready to exit . They were not shot at , even where Route South skirts the Crater . " Finchley ? Can I get out of this pesky cocoon now ? "  | " Yes , Miss . But I 'd feel easier if you would wear the Swedish belt . Some of these drivers are cowboys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant I can take it off . " ( Eunice , the engineer if-that's-the-word who designed if-that's-the-word these goddam straps did not have women in mind ! ) ( You 've got it rigged for a man , Boss  --  of course you 're pinching a tit . Move the bottom half closer in and shift the upper anchor point after we stop ; that 's the way they rigged it for me . Some man has used it since the last time I did . ) ( Jake , probably , sometime when his own car was laid up . Sweetheart , how many things do I have to learn about being a woman before I can avoid tripping over my feet ? ) ( Thousands . But you 're doing all right , Boss  --  and I 'm always here to catch you . ) ( Beloved . Say , this does n't look like picnic country . I wonder if Finchley is lost . ) They were passing through solid masses of " bedroom " areas  --  walled enclaves , apartment houses , a few private homes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car 's air-conditioning system still fought smog . But not for long  --  Finchley turned into a secondary freight route and shortly they had farms on each side . Joan noticed that one belonged to her  --  to a subsidiary of Smith Enterprises , she corrected , and reminded herself that she no longer held control . Nevertheless she noted that the guard at a corner watch tower seemed alert and the steel fence was stout and tall and capped with barbed wire and an alarm strand , all in good maintenance . But they were past without her seeing what was being cropped  --  no matter ; Johann had never tried to manage that slice of the conglom , he had known his limitations . ( Eunice , what are we raising back there ? ) ( Joan , I ca n't see if you do n't look  --  and you never looked . ) ( Sorry , dearest . Speak up if you do n't like the service . ) ( I will . I think it was a rotation crop . This soil has been farmed so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) ( What happens when the soil no longer responds to management ? ) ( We starve , of course . What do you expect ? But before that they 'll build on it . ) ( Eunice , it 's got to stop , somewhere . When I was a boy I was a city kid but I could walk in less than an hour to green fields and uncut woods . . . woods so private I could play Tarzan in my skin . I was n't just lucky '  --  even in New York City a boy with five cents could ride to farms and woods in less time than it took me to walk it . ) ( Does n't seem possible , Boss . ) ( I know . It 's taken a fast car and a professional driver to do what I used to do on bare feet  --  yet this is n't realp221farm country ; these are open-air food factories with foremen and time clocks and shop stewards and payroll deductions and house-organ magazinesand you name it . A dug well and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be justified ; those open wells and tin dippers spread disease . Just the same , the tin-dipper era was a good time in this country ... and this one is n't . Where do we go from here ? ) The inner voice failed to answer . Joan waited . ( Eunice ? ) ( Boss , I do n't know ! ) ( Sorry , just sounding off . Eunice , all my life I did the best I knew how with what I had . I did n't waste  --  shucks , even that white-elephant house keeps a lot of people off Welfare . But every year things got worse . I used to get sour consolation from knowing that I was n't going to be around when things fell to pieces . Now it looks like I will be . That 's why I say : ' Where do we go from here ? ' I do n't know the answer , either . ) ( Boss ? ) ( Yes , dearest ? ) ( I could see it , too . Moving from an Iowa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I did have plans , sort of . I knew you were going to die , I could n't help but know , and I figured that Joe would get tired of me someday  --  no kids and no prospect of any , and me someday no longer with a fine job that took care of everything Joe needed . I underrated Joe ; nevertheless I never forgot that he could hand me a pink slip anytime . So I had plans , and saved my money . The Moon . ) ( The Moon ! Hey , that 's a fine idea ! Take one of Pan Am 's package tours -- deluxe with private courier and all the trimmings . Do it before we bulge so big we ca n't climb through a hatch . What do you say , little imp ? ) ( If you want to . ) ( You do n't sound enthusiastic . ) ( I 'm not against it , Boss . But I was n't saving money for a tourist trip . I meant to put my name on the list and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay the difference , since I did n't have one of the subsidized skills . Out-migrate . Permanently . ) ( I 'll be durned ! You had this in mind  --  and never said a word ? ) ( Why talk about if and when ? I did n't plan to do it as long as you or Joe needed me . But I did have reason to be serious . I told you I was licensed for three kids . ) ( Yes , surely . I 've known it since your first security check . ) ( Well , three is a high quota , Boss  --  more than half a child over replacement . A woman can he proud of a three-baby license . But I wanted more . ) ( So ? You can , now . Fines are no problem , even though they 've uppedp222them again and made them progressive . Eunice , if you want babies , this one is just a starter . ) ( Dear Boss . Let 's see how we do with this one first . I knew I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no restrictions against babies . They want babies . I think we 're there . ) Finchley turned in at a gate  --  Agroproducts , Inc. , Joan noticed  --  a competitor . He parked so as not to block the gate , then got out and went to the guard post . He had parked at such an angle that Joan could not see what was going on , the armor between her and the control compartment cut off her view . Finchley returned , the car rolled through the gate . " Miss Smith , I was told to hold it under twenty miles per hour , so no safety belts is okay now . " " Thank you , Finchley . How much was the bribe ? " " Oh , nothing to matter , Miss . " " So ? I expect to see it on O'Neil 's Friday Report . If it is not there , I will have to ask you again . " " It 'll be there , Miss , " the driver answered promptly . " But I do n't know yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Administration Building and get us cleared through a back gate . To where you picnic . " " To where we picnic . " Joan stopped to think . It irked her to pay a bribe when her status as a major competitor ( retired , conceded ) entitled her by protocol to red-carpet treatment . But she had not sent word ahead , a minimum courtesy in visiting a competitor 's plant , to allow him time to sweep dirt under the rug or to divert the visitor away from things . Industrial espionage could not with propriety be conducted at top level . " Finchley , did you tell the gate guard whom you were driving ? " " Oh , no , Miss ! " Finchley sounded shocked . " But he checked the license even though I tell him it 's your car  --  best to tell ; he has a list of all private armoreds in the state , just like I have . What I tell him was , I 'm driving guests of Mr. Salomon . . . and let him think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yen to picnic in a safe spot . Did n't tell him anything really , except Mr. Salomon 's name . That okay ? " " Just fine , Finchley . " ( Eunice , I feel like an interloper , being inside without giving my name . Rude . ) ( Look at it this way , Boss . You know who you are . But the public does n't  --  not after that silly carnival yesterday . I think it 's best to be Jake 's guest ... which is true , in a way . ) ( I still feel that I should tell Finchley to give my name to the Chief Agronomist . But would the word get out ? Or , rather , how soon ? ) ( Thirty minutes . Long enough for some clerk to phone in and a news copter to fly out.  |p223Then  some snoop will try to interview you by loudspeaker because the boys wo n't let him land . ) ( Some picnic ! ) ( If he does land , Shorty and Fred will be elbowing each other for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boss , maybe you have n't noticed , but , while they call you Miss Smith , ' they treat you exactly as they treated me . In their heads they know you are you . . . but in their guts they feel you are me . ) ( That 's not far wrong , Eunice . In my head I am me . . . but in my guts  --  your pretty belly  --  I am you . ) ( Boss , I like that . We 're the only one-headed Siamese twins in history . But not everything in our belly is me . There 's one wiggler swimming faster than the rest  --  and he is Johann , ' not Joan , not Eunice  --  and if he makes it to the finish line , he 's more important than both of us put together . ) ( My love , you 're a sentimentalist . ) ( I 'm a slob , Boss . And so are you . ) ( Nolo contendere . When I think about Johann and Eunice  --  both dead , really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I come unstuck and want to cry . ) ( Better not , Joan ; the car is stopping . Boss ? How long does it take a wiggler to get there ? I know a spermatozoon has to move several inches to reach the ovum  --  but how fast does he swim ? ) ( Durned if I know , dear . Let 's leave that cork in place at least a couple of days . Give the little bastard every possible chance . ) ( Good ! ) ( Do you know how to take it out ? Or do we have to see Dr. O'Neil ? We do n't want to let Winnie in on this . ) ( Boss , I 've seated them and taken them out so many times bumpers than most girls have shoes . ) ( Bragging . Boasting . ) ( Only a trifle , Boss dearest . I told you I had always been an ever-ready . For years and years , any day I missed was not my idea . I knew my purpose in life clear back when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a virgin . ) Finchley returned to the car , spoke after he had buttoned in . " Miss ? " " Yes , Finchley . " " Farm boss sends greetings and says guests of Counselor Salomon are honored guests of Agroproducts . No bribe . But he asked if the main gate guard had put the squeeze ; I told him No . Correct ? " " Of course , Finchley . We do n't rat on other people 's employees . " " Do n't think he believed me but he did n't push it . He invited you both  --  assumed there was two and I did n't correct it  --  to stop for a drink or coffee on the way out . I let him think you might , or might not . " " Thank you , Finchley . " They continued through the farm , came to another high gate ; Fred gotp224out and pressed a button , spoke to the security office . The gate rolled back , closed after them . Shortly the car stopped ; Finchley unloaded the passenger compartment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , this is lovely ! I did n't know there were such places left . " The spot was beautiful in a simple fashion . A little stream , clear and apparently unpolluted , meandered between low banks . On and near its banks were several sorts of trees and bushes , but they were not dense and there was a carpet of grass filling the open spaces . From its lawnlike texture it had apparently been grazed . The sky was blue with scattered fair-weather cumulus and the sunshine was golden warm without being too hot . ( Eunice , is n't it grand ? ) ( Uh huh . ' Minds me of Iowa before the summer turns hot . ) Joan Eunice stripped off her sandals , tossed them into the car on top of her cloak . She wiggled her toes . " Oh , delicious ! I have n't felt grass under my bare feet for more than twenty years . Finchley , Shorty , Fred  --  all of you ! If you 've got the sense God promised a doorknob , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet a treat . " Shotguns looked impassive ; Finchley looked thoughtful . Then he grinned . " Miss Smith , you do n't have to tell me twice ! " He reached down and unclicked his boots . Joan Eunice smiled , turned away , and wandered down toward the stream , judging that Shorty would be less shy about it if she did not stare . ( Eunice , is Iowa this beautiful ? Still ? ) ( Parts of it , hon. But it 's filling up fast . Take where we lived , between Des Moines and Grinnell . Nothing but farms when I was a baby . But by the time I left home we had more commuter neighbors than farm neighbors . They were beginning to build enclaves , too . ) ( Dreadful . Eunice , this country is breeding itself to death . ) ( For a freshly knocked-up broad you have an odd attitude toward reproduction , twin . See that grassy spot where the stream turns ? ) ( Yes . Why ? ) ( It takes me back ... it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my alleged innocence . ) ( Well ! Nice place for it . Did you struggle ? ) ( Twin , are you pulling my leg ? I cooperated . ) ( Hurt ? ) ( Not enough to slow me down . No reason for it to . Boss darling , I know how it was in your day . But there is no longer any issue over tissue . Girls with smart mothers have it removed surgically when they reach menarche . And some just lose it gradually and never know where it went . But the girl who yells bloody murder and bleeds like a stuck pig is a rare bird today . ) ( Infant , I must again set you straight . Things have n't changed much.  |p225Exce|pt  that people are more open about it now . Do you suppose that water is warm enough to swim in ? ) ( Warm enough , Boss . But how do we know it 's clean ? No telling what 's upstream . ) ( Eunice , you 're a sissy . If you do n't bet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday ... but today we 're an expectant mother . A babbling brook can be loaded with nineteen sorts of horribles . ) ( Uh . . . oh , hell ! If it 's polluted , it 'd be posted . ) ( Back here where you ca n't reach it without being passed through two electric gates ? Ask Finchley ; he may know . ) ( And if he says it 's polluted ? ) ( Then we go swimming anyhow . Boss , as you pointed out , if you do n't bet , you ca n't win . ) ( Mmmm . . . if he bums it 's polluted , I 'm chicken . As you pointed out , beloved , we now have responsibilities . Let 's go eat , I 'm hungry . ) ( You 're hungry ? I was beginning to think you had given up the habit . ) ( So let 's eat while we can . I low soon does morning sickness start ? ) ( Who dat , Boss ? The other time the only effect it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and night . Let 's eat ! ) Joan Eunice trotted back toward the car , stopped dead when she saw that Shorty was laying the car 's folding table  --  with one place setting . " What 's that ? " " Your lunch , Miss . " " A picnic ? On a table ? Do you want to starve the ants ? It should be on the ground . " Shorty looked unhappy . " If you say , Miss . " ( Joan ! You 're not wearing parities . If you loll on the ground , you 'll shock Shorty  --  and interest the others . ) ( Spoilsport . Oh , all right . ) " Since it 's set up , Shorty , leave it that way . But set three more places . " " Oh , we eat in the car , Miss  --  we often do . " She stomped her foot . " Shorty , if you make me eat alone , I 'll make you walk home . Whose idea was this ? Finchley 's ? Finchley ! Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at the table . It was crowded as Joan had insisted that everything be placed on it at once  --  " Just reach , " ' he explained . " Or starve . Is there a strong man here who can open that wine bottle ? " I he dexterity with which Shorty opened it caused her to suspect that he had not always been a teetotaler . She filled her glass and Fred 's , then reached for Finchley 's . He said , " Please , Miss Smith  --  I 'm driving , " and put his hand over it.  | " Give it to me , " she answered , " for four drops . For a toast . And four drops for you , Shorty , for the same purpose . " She put about a quarter of an inch in each of their glasses . " But first  --  Shorty , will you say grace ? " The big man looked startled , at once regained his composure . " Miss Smith , I 'd be pleased . " He bowed his head . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down ! Om Mani Padme Hum . ) ( Oh ! Om Mani Padme Hum . ) ( Om Mani Padme Hum . ) ( Om Mani Padme Hum ) " Amen . " " Amen ! " ( Om Mani Padme Hum . Amen . ) " Amen . Thank you , Shorty . Now for a toast  --  which is a sort of a prayer , too . We 'll all drink it , so it must be to someone who is n't here . . . but should be . " ( Boss ! You must stop this  --  it 's morbid . ) ( Mind your own business ! ) " Will one of you propose it ? " Finchley and Shorty looked at each other  --  looked away . Joan caught Fred 's eye . " Fred ? " " Uh  --  Miss , I do n't know how ! " He seemed upset . " You stand up "  --  Joan stood , the others followed  --  " and say whatever you like about someone who is n't here but would be welcome . Anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honored . " She raised her glass , realized her tears were starting . ( Eunice ! Are you crying ? Or am I ? I never used to cry ! ) ( Then do n't get me started , Boss  --  I told you I was a sentimental slob . ) Fred said uncertainly , " A toast to . . . someone we all like . . . and who should be here . And still is ! " He suddenly looked frightened . " Amen , " Shorty said in sonorous baritone . " And still is . ' Because Heaven is as close as you 'll let it be . That 's what I tell my people , Fred .. . and in your heart you know I 'm right . " He poured down , solemnly and carefully , the symbolic teaspoonful of wine in his glass ; they all drank . Joan said quietly , " Thank you , Fred . She heard you . She heard you too , Shorty . She hears me now . " ( Boss ! You 've got them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit down . And eat . Tell ' em I said to ! You 've ruined a perfectly good picnic . ) ( No , I have n't . ) " Finchley . You knew her well . Probably better than I did . . . for I was a cranky old man and she catered to my illness . What would she want us to do now ? " " What would . . . Mrs. Branca ? ... want us to do ? " " Yes . Did you call her Mrs. Branca ' ? Or Eunice ' ? " ( They called me Eunice , ' Boss  --  and after the first week I kissed them hello and good-bye and thanked them for taking care of me . Even if Jake could see . He just pretended not to notice . ) ( Busybody . You 're a sweet girl , beloved.  |p227Anything  more than kiss them ? ) ( Heavens , Boss ! Even getting them to accept a kiss in place of the tips they would n't take took doing . ) ( I 'll bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ( Knocked-up broad . ) " Uh , I called her Mrs. Branca ' at first . Then she called me Tom ' and I called her Eunice . ' " All right , Tom , what does Eunice want us to do ? Stand here crying ? I are tears in your eyes ; I 'm not the only one crying . Would Eunice have us spoil a picnic ? " Uh- She 'd say , Sit down and eat . ' " " ' That she would ! " Shorty agreed . " Eunice would say , Do n't let hot things get cold and cold things get hot  --  eat ! " " Yes , " agreed Joan Eunice , sitting down , " as Eunice was never a spoilsport in all her short and beautiful life and would n't let anyone else be especially me , when I was cranky . Reach me a drumstick , Fred  --  no , do n't pass it . " Joan took a bite of chicken . ( Twin , what Shorty said sounded like a quotation . ) ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eaten with him before . ) ( With all of them . When a team drove me late at night , I always invited them in for a bite . Joe never minded , he liked them all . Shorty he was especially glad to see ; he wanted Shorty to model for him . At first Shorty thought Joe was making fun of him  --  did n't know that Joe rarely joked and never about painting . They never got to it , though , as Shorty is shy  --  was n't sure it was all right to pose naked and scared that I might show up while he was posing . Not that I would have . ) ( Not even once , little imp ? Shorty is a beautiful tower of ebony . ) ( Boss , I keep telling you  --  ) (  --  that nudity does n't mean anything to your generation . Depends on the skin , does n't it ? I would enjoy seeing our black giant  --  and that goes for Johann as well as fit Joan . ) ( Well  --  ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to make conversation . ) " Tom , do you have those mustard pickles staked out , or mar I have some ? Shorty , you sounded as if you had sampled Eunice 's cooking . Could she cook ? " Finchley answered , " You bet she could ! " " Real cooking ? Anybody can flash a prepack  --  and that 's what kids nowadays seem to think is cooking . " ( Boss , I 'll spit in your soup ! ) " But what could she have done faced with flour and lard and baking powder and such  --  " Eunice would have done just fine , " Shorty said quietly . " True , she mostly never had time for real cooking  --  but when she did  --  or whatever she done , anyways  --  she done just perfect . " ( My fan ! Boss  --  give him a raise . ) ( No . ) ( Stingy . ) ( No , Eunice . Shortyp228killed the vermin who killed you . I want to do something for him . But it ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) " She was an artist , " agreed Fred . " You mean artist ' in the general sense . Her husband was , I recall , an artist in the usual sense . A painter . Is he a good one ? I 've never seen any of his work . Do any of you know ? " Finchley said , " I guess that 's a matter of opinion , Miss Smith . I like Joe Branca 's paintings  --  but I do n't know anything about art ; I just know what I like . But  --  " He grinned . " Can I tell on you , Shorty ? " " Aw , Tom ! " " You were flattered , you know you were . Miss Smith , Joe Branca wanted to paint that big ape on your right . " ( Bingo ! ) ( Trouble , Eunice ? ) " And did he , Shorty ? " " Well , no . But he did ask me . He did . " ( Do n't you see , Boss ? This is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere else . . . and then had confirmed to the hilt . Now you know I 'm me . ) ( Oh , piffle , darling . ) ( But Boss  --  ) ( I 've known you were you all along , beloved . But this isn ' proof . Once I knew that Joe and Shorty had met , it was a logical necessity that Joe would want him to model  --  any artist would want to paint him . ) ( Boss , you make sick ! It 's proof . I 'm me . ) ( Beloved darling without whom life would not be worth living even in this beautiful body , I know you are you . But flatworms do n't matter , coincidences do n't matter , no mundane proof matters . There is no proof that some cocksure psychiatrist could not explain away as coincidence , or deja vu , or self-delusion . If we let them set the rules , we 're lost . But we sha n't . What does matter is that you have me , and I have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all so easy with me that they 'll call me Eunice . You say they used to kiss you ? ) ( Oh , sure . Friendly kisses . Well , Dabrowski used to put zing in it but you know how Poles are . ) ( I 'm afraid I do n't . ) ( Put it this way , Boss . With a Pole do n't advertise unless you mean to deliver  --  because his intentions are as honest as a loaded gun . With Dabrowski I was very careful not to let it go critical . ) ( I 'll remember . Just as well he is n't here . Because the situation is like that with Jake , only milder . Little baggage , you caused all my mobile guards to fall in love with you . So now I 've got to get them to accept that you are dead while feeling that you are still alive , equally . If they call me Eunice , ' I 'm halfway there . If they kiss me  --  ) ( What ? Boss ! Do n't try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you had n't played My Last Duchess ' to half the county , I would n't be having to repair the damage . ) ( Damage , ' huh ? You 're complaining ? )  | ( No , no , my darling ! Never . I was the prime beneficiary of your benevolence . But to lose something of value is a damage , and that is the damage I must repair . ) ( Well . . . I wo n't argue , dearest . But in this case you can let it be ; I never let it warm up that much . ) ( And I say you do n't know what you are talking about . Cool you may have meant to keep it . Unsexy  --  or as unsexy as you could manage which is n't very . But all four of my mobiles were willing to die for you  --  correct ? ) ( Uh  --  ) ( Let 's have no silly talk . Do you think the fact that I paid them had anything to do with their willingness ? Careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to answer ! Boss , what 's the use of stirring them up over my death ? ) ( Because , my darling , from now on they will be guarding me as I now am , inside your lovely body  --  just as they guarded you . They 've got to want to guard me , or they 'll never be happy in this weird situation . It 's either that , or fire them or retire them  --  ) ( Oh , no ! ) ( Of course not . To paraphrase Sherlock Holmes ; when you have eliminated what you ca n't do , what remains is what you must do . Besides , dearest and only , this is stern practice for the much harder case we still face . ) ( Jake ? But Jake is  --  ) ( Little stupid ! Jake has already accepted the impossible . I mean Joe . ) ( But , Boss ! You must never see Joe . ) ( God knows I wish I could avoid it . Never mind , beloved ; we wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we must . Now either shut up , or coach me in how to handle these brave men . ) ( Well . . . I 'll help all I can . But you 'll never get them as easy as they were with me  --  ' kissing-friends ' easy , I mean . I was an employee . You are the Boss . ) ( If that argument were valid , queens would never get pregnant . Sure it makes it harder . But you 've given me a lot to work with . Want to bet ? ) ( Oh , sure , I 'll bet you a billion dollars you ca n't kiss even one of them . Do n't be silly , Boss ; we can never make a real bet , there is no way to pay off . ) ( You do n't have much practice being an angel , do you , little imp ? You still think in earthy terms . Certainly we can make a bet and pay off to the winner . This baby in us  --  ) ( Huh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , Eunice . If 1 win this bet , I name our baby . If I lose , you have the privilege . Fair bet ? ) ( Oh . All right , it 's a bet . But you 'll lose . ) ( We 'll see . ) ( Oh , yes , you will , Boss . You 'll lose even if you win . Want to know why ? ) ( Planning on cheating ? ) ( Not necessary , Boss darling ; you 're going to find that you want to name the baby whatever name I want it to have.  |p230Because  you 're a sucker for a pretty girl , Boss , always have been and still are . ) ( Now wait a moment . I used to be , but now I am that pretty girl ' and  --  ) ( You 'll find out . Do you want coaching ? I 'll help you win if it can be done . It ca n't . ) ( Yes , but tuck your advice in edgeways ; I 've been chewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll trade you one of these Danish sandwiches for more wine . Then keep our glasses filled ; Shorty does n't drink and Tom wo n't and I want company in getting tiddly , this is my freedom celebration . " ( Fred might be easiest if you can get him over seeing ghosts when he looks at you . ) " I do n't mind another glass , Miss , but I must n't get tiddly , I 'm on duty . " " Pish and tush . Tom and Shorty will get us home even if they have to drag us . Right , Shorty ? " ( Shorty is your impossible case . I managed it only by being little girl ' to him  --  which you ca n't be , Boss . ) " We 'll certainly try , Miss Smith . " " Do I have to be Miss Smith ' on a picnic ? You called Mrs. Branca Eunice , ' did you not ? Did she call you Shorty ? ' " " Miss , she called me by my name . Hugo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's the name my mother gave me , Miss . " " That answers me , Hugo ; I will remember . But it brings to mind a problem . Anybody want to fight me for the last black olive ? Come on , put up your dukes . But that 's not the problem . I said I did n't want to be called Miss Smith ' under these circumstances . But I do n't want to be called Johann ' either ; that 's a man 's name . Hugo , you have christened babies ? " " Many times , Miss  --  uh , Miss  --  " Joan cut in fast . " That 's right , you do n't know what to call me . Hugo , having named so many babies you must have opinions about names . Do you think Joan ' pronounced as two syllables would be a good name for a girl who used to be a man named Johann ? ' " " Yes . I do . " " Tom ? What do you think ? " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you were n't his employer . I do n't think he ever did give up hoping to catch me alone . . . so I was as careful not to let that chance come up as I was with Dabrowski . All it took with Tom was to say , Tom , if you 're going to be stuffy about letting me pay for extra service '  --  it was an after-midnight run , Boss ; a rare-blood call  --  ' at least you can kiss me good-night . ' So he did , quite well . After which Hugo was too polite not to lean way down and give me a fatherly little peck . But what worked forp231Eunice ca n't work for Miss Smith . ' ) ( So watch me switch decks on them , young ' un . ) " It sounds like a good name to me , " the driver-guard agreed . " Fred ? Do I look like Joan ' to you ? " She sat up straight and lifted her chest . ( You look like you 're going to break that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pfui , little hussy ; it ca n't break . I want him to realize that I 'm female . ) ( He realizes it . Winnie ought to be here to take his pulse . ) " I do n't see why anybody should get a vote but you . But , sure , I like it . " " Good ! I still have to sign papers with my former name  --  but I 'm Joan ' to my mind . But , friends , this country must have a thousand Joan Smiths ' in it ; I need a middle name . But I want one for a much better reason . " She looked with solemn seriousness at the giant black . " Hugo , you are a man of God . Would it be presumptuous of me to call myself .. . ' Juan Eunice ? ' " ( Boss , if you make my friend Hugo cry , I 'll  --  I 'll  --  I wo n't speak to you the rest of the day ! ) ( Oh , quit nagging ! Hugo wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three who believes you 're here . He has faith . ) " I think that would be beautiful , " the Reverend Hugo White answered solemnly and sniffed back tears . " Hugo , Eunice would not want you to be sad about it . " She looked away from him , her own eyes bright with unshed tears . " That settles it . My new name will be  --  is !  --  Joan Eunice . I do n't want anyone ever to forget Eunice . Most especially I want you , her friends , to know this . Now that I am a woman , Eunice is my model , the ideal I must live up to , every hour , every minute , of my new life . Will you help me ? Will you treat me as Eunice ? Yes , yes , I 'm your employer ; somehow I must be both , and it 's not easy . But the most difficult part for me is to learn to behave and think and feel as Eunice ... when I 've had so many weary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are her friends  --  will you help me ? " ( Boss , did you ever sell real estate in Florida ? ) ( Damn it , if you ca n't help , keep quiet ! ) ( Sorry , Boss . That was applause . As Hugo would say , ' You done perfect . ) Tom Finchley said quietly , " We 'll help . That goes for Dabrowski , too . Ily the way , she called him Anton . ' First she called him Ski ' like the rest of us . Then she learned his first name and called him by it . " " Then I will call him Anton . ' Will you all call me Eunice ' ? Or at least ' Joan Eunice ' ? To help me ? Oh , call me Miss Smith ' when others are around ; I know you wo n't feel easy otherwise . You probably called her ' Mt Branca ' if other people were  --  " We did . "  | " So call me Miss Smith ' when it would be natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you called her Eunice , ' call me Joan Eunice ' and  --  dear and trusted friends !  --  any time you feel that I have earned it , please call me Eunice . ' It will be the highest compliment you can pay me , so do n't use it lightly . Leave off the Joan ' and call me Eunice . ' Will you ? " Finchley looked at her , unsmiling . " Yes . . . Eunice . " " Tom , I have n't earned it yet . " Finchley did not answer . Fred said , " Let me get this straight . Joan Eunice ' is for everyday . . . but Eunice ' means we think you 've done and said just what Mrs. Branca would have . " " That 's right , that 's what I said . " " Then I know what Tom meant . Uh , this has been a touchy day  --  worse for you , I 'd say , but not easy for any of us . Shorty  --  Hugo , I mean  --  said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ca n't argue ; Shorty is a preacher and knows more about angels and suchlike than I do . But if she was  --  is , I mean  --  still , she had a lot of salt and pepper in her , too . You remember an hour back when you snapped at Shorty and yelled for Tom ? " She sighed . " Yes , I remember . I lost my temper . I 've got a long way to go . I know it . " " But that 's just what I 'm saying . . . Eunice . She had a lot of spunk . If we had tried to make her eat by herself , she would have kicked the gong . Right , Shorty ?  --  I mean Hugo . ' " " Amen ! Eunice . " Finchley said , " Fred read my mind close enough ... Eunice . But I was thinking of other things , too . I never thought of her as an angel , partic'arly . She just treated us like people . " " Tom  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My name 's Shorty to you  --  and to you , Fred . Do n't put on any fancies . Hugo was Mama 's name for me . And hers . Yours , Eunice . But I near forgot what I had to say . Tom , that 's all anybody wants . To be treated like people . ' She done it that way  --  Eunice . And now you do , too . Like people . ' Mr. Smith did n't quite manage it . But he was old and sick , and we made allowances . " " Oh , dear ! I feel like crying again . Hugo  --  when I was Mr. Smith , I never meant to be anything but people . Truly I did n't . " " Sick people ca n't help being cranky . My Daddy got so mean before he passed on , I run away from home . Worst mistake I ever made . But I don'tp233fault him for it . We do what we do , then we live with it . Eunice  --  the first Eunice  --  is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head knows . But she had her little human ways , same as everybody . The dear Lord do n't fault is for that . " " Hugo ? If it had been me and not her , would I have made it ? To Heaven ? " ( Om Mani Padme Hum ! Watch it , Boss ! He 'll drag you over to that creek and wash your sins away . ) ( If he wants to , I 'll let him . Shut up ! ) " I do n't rightly know , " the preacher said softly . " I never knew Mr. Smith that well . But the Lord do move in mysterious ways . Looks like He give you a second chance . He always knows what He 's doing . " ( Oh , all right , twin . Try not to get water up our nose . ) " Thank you , Hugo . I think He did , too  --  and I 'm trying to justify it . " She sighed . " But it 's not easy . I try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second chance she gave me . I think I know what she would do now . But I 'm not certain . " ( I 'd knock off all this talk , that 's what I 'd do . ) Pipe down and give me a chance . ) She looked around . " I do n't know how well you knew her and I keep learning things about her . I think you three you four ; I include Anton -- -must have been her closest friends , at least in my household . Certainly you knew her better than I had thought . Tom ? " " Yes , Eunice ? " " Did you ever kiss her ? " Her driver looked startled . " Yes ... Joan Eunice . " " Meaning Eunice would never ask such a question ; she would just do what her heart told her to . I wanted to , Tom  --  but I was scared . Not yet used to being a girl . " She jumped up , stood by his chair , took his hands , pulled . Slowly he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders , put up tier face  --  waited . He sighed and almost scowled , then took her in his arms and kissed her . ( I win , he can do lots better . ) ( He will . The poor dear is scared . ) Joan let hmi go without forcing it beyond his willingness , whispered , " Thank you , Toni , " and quickly left his arms. went on to Fred , took his hands . Again Fred looked frightened but he got up promptly . ( What about Fred , Eunice ? Sexy or sisterly ? ) ( Too late , twin ! ) Fred embraced her with unexpected force , met her mouth so quickly that Joan was caught with her lips open and he at once answered it . savagely . But briefly . He broke from it and both were trembling . ( Eunice ! What isp234this ? You did n't warn me . ) ( So I goofed . Later , dear . Slow march now and say three Money Hums and be darn sure to be an innocent child with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long way , stopped by Hugo , waited . He got up from his chair , looked down at her . She moved closer , put her hands on his chest , looked up , face solemn , lips closed , eyes open . Gently he put his arms around her . ( My God , Eunice , if he really hugged us , he ' ud break us in two ! ) ( He never will , twin ; he 's the gentlest man alive . ) Hugo 's lips met hers in soft benediction , unhurried but quickly over . She stayed in his arms a moment . " Hugo ? When you pray for her tonight , will you add a prayer for me ? I may not deserve it . But I need it . " " I will , Eunice . " He seated her with gallant grace , then sat down again . ( High , low , jack , and game , twin  --  what are you going to name him ? ) ( Eunice , ' of course ! ) ( Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a boy , he 'll be named Jacob E.  --  for Eunice '  --  Smith . ) ( Johann E. Smith ' is better . ) ( I won the bet , so shut up . I wo n't wish Johann ' on a boy . Now what 's this about Fred ? ) ( You wo n't believe it . ) ( By now I believe anything . All right , later . ) " Fred , is there any wine in that bottle ? Hugo , will you open the second bottle ? I need it , I 'm shaky . " " Certainly , Eunice . Hand me the bottle , Fred . " " I 'm going to eat some more , too , and I hope all of you will . Tom , am I still Eunice ' ? Or am I a hussy who does n't understand how a lady behaves ? " " Yes , Eunice . I mean No , Eunice . ' I  --  Oh , hell ! " She patted his hand . " That 's the nicest compliment I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Oh , hell ' to Miss Smith ... but you know that Eunice  --  and Joan Eunice  --  is human . " She looked around the table . " Do you know how good it is to be touched ? Have you ever watched kittens snuggling ? For over a quarter of a century no one kissed me . Except for an occasional handshake I do n't think anyone ever touched me . Until nurses and doctors started handling me . Friends  --  dear friends  --  you have taken me back into the human race , with your lips . I am so very grateful to Eunice  --  to Eunice Branca  --  that she kissed you before I did , and won your friendship  --  your love ? I think so . For it meant that you let me in  --  treated me as people ' ! Uh , tell me this , I must know  --  even if it makes you , Tom , call me Joan Eunice ' again . Did Eunice kiss Anton , too ? " ( Boss , I 'm not going to tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask you , dear . ) " Wo n't anyone tell me ? Well , I suppose it 's an unfair question . "  |p235Finchley  said suddenly , " Teams shift around . I drive with Fred , and Shorty with Ski , and so forth . Been times when I rode Shotgun for Ski . Eunice , she treated us all alike . But do n't never think anything bad about it " I do n't ! " "  --  because there was n't any such . She was so warm and friendly  --  and good  --  that she could kiss a man friend just for , uh  --  " " For lovingkindness , " Shorty supplied . " For lovingkindness . ' Kissed us thank-you and good-night as quick with her husband there as any other time . Always did , if we stopped for a late bite o ' supper with them . " ( All right , twin . Fred and Anton . Not Tom and Hugo . Happened only once . Oh , Tom would have , but no chance , so I kept it cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never tried . He has moral character  --  something you and I do n't know anything about . ) " Thank you for telling me , Tom . I 'll never let Anton guess . But he 'll find me easy to kiss if he wishes to . . . now that I know that she shared lovingkindness with him . Abrupt change of subject : Tom , is that pretty little stream polluted ? It looks so clean . " " It 's clean . Clean as a creek can be , I mean . I know because I found out about this place through the company lending it to our guild for a picnic . Some of us went swimming after the farm super told us it was okay . " " Oh , wonderful ! Because I want to swim . I last went swimming in natural water  --  old swimming hole style , I mean  --  let me see ... goodness ! More than three-quarters of a century ago . " " Eunice , I do n't think you should . " " Why ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not all the dropouts are in the A.A.s ; any wild countryside attracts them . Like this . I did n't make a fuss but when you walked down to the bank by yourself , Fred had you flanked one side and me the other . " " Well , heavens , if you can keep me safe on the bank , you can keep me safe in the water . " " It ai n't quite the same , truly it ai n't . I was a few seconds late once , I wo n't be again . Some dropouts are real nasty weirdos , not just harmless nuts . " " Tom , why argue ? I want to get into that water , feel it all over me . I intend to . " " I wish you would n't ... Joan Eunice . " She jerked her head around at the last two words . Then she grinned
