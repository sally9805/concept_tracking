Even as rescuers were searching for the victims of Europe 's latest avalanches ( see THE WORLD ) , scientists atop an Alpine mountain were continuing the work that may some day prevent such disasters . They are members of Switzerland 's Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research , the world 's first and foremost scientific establishment dedicated to the study and forecasting of avalanches . Before the institute was established 26 years ago , high above the resort town of Davos in the eternal snows of the 8,000-ft . Weissfluhjoch , knowledge of avalanches consisted mostly of folklore . Now , thanks to the institute 's physicists , crystallographers , engineers and foresters , science has come closer to understanding the mysterious mechanisms that tumble torrents of snow down the mountainsides . <P> Jagged Beauty . At the core of all avalanche research is snow itself . Often hexagonal-shaped , the tiny crystals that make up snowflakes are as exquisitely formed as the finest man-made jewelry . As the crystals alter their beautiful structure under the influence of wind , temperature change , icy vapors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to interlock . They degenerate into coarser , larger crystals and sometimes even into lumps of ice . Such " old " snow can not maintain a good grip on the soil or underlying layers of snow . The slightest disturbance may tear it free : the sonic boom of a passing aircraft , the stresses created by a pair of skis <P> even a loud shout by a solitary skier . <P> As a result of their studies , Avalanchologist Andre Roche and other institute scientists now classify avalanches in two basic groups . One is the dreaded Staublawine ( German for dust avalanche ) , which may occur , for example , when heavy new snowfalls fail to cling to the older foundation and begin to slide in billowing masses down the slope . It can be set off by a sudden shift of wind . Literally riding on a cushion of air at speeds of up to 150 m.p.h. , dust avalanches create such enormous pressure differentials that they have been known to pull people out of their homes or knock down scores of trees without actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the giant slab avalanche , or Schneebrett ( snow board ) , in which a huge mass of snow may come sliding down , as at Reckingen in Switzerland last week . Highly unpredictable , slab avalanches occur when one cohesive layer of snow breaks free of the ground or of other snow layers . They can be caused by rising temperatures that send lubricating water between layers of snow , letting the white blanket slip like a quilt from the bed of a tossing sleeper . Exerting forces as great as 100 tons per square yard , such avalanches have been known to upend steel locomotives , push small bridges hundreds of feet from their pilings and rip up vast reaches of forest .
