txt The weight of the primary processes now falls squarely on the shoulders of California Republicans : Theirs will not be just another primary ? it will be " the " primary . How Republicans vote here could well decide whether the President gets the nomination or is deposed by home-stater Ronald Reagan Until now many Republicans across the nation have been registering a protest vote when marking their ballots for Mr. Reagan . Many voters , including disgruntled Democrats in crossover primaries , have not necessarily been saying they wanted Mr. Reagan to be president when they vote for him , over Mr. Ford . Instead , Monitor soundings have shown that often these were simply protest votes ? a protest against government in general , against high taxes , against inflation , against U.S. foreign policy , against Washington . But now Republicans here are confronted with making a choice that could well decide who will sit in the White House after 1976 . And knowledgeable observers of the California political scene say this new weight of voter responsibility may help the President . The President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // * California to be the ' primary // New York Republican delegation pledged 119 of its 154 votes to him . The additional New York delegates mean Mr. Ford now has 697 delegates to Mr. Reagan 's 540 . The important elements in the Ford-Reagan battle here now can be seen in perspective : ? For Mr. Reagan the outcome is even more crucial than it is for the President . Mr. Reagan must win here if he is going to have sufficient delegates to move toward a possible deadlock and , from there , have a chance to grab the additional delegates needed to win the nomination . Should the former California governor lose the massive bloc of delgates here that comes on a winner-take-all basis , he will open the door to the President 's winning a first-ballot victory at Kansas City . Observers generally are saying it is all over for Mr. Reagan if he loses here ? not only because the delegate totals will show him substantially behind Mr. Ford but because it will show he is not sufficiently popular to carry his home state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford ? a primary that the home-state candidate must win to keep his campaign alive . ? For the President the California primary is only slightly less important than it is for Mr. Reagan . An embarrassingly bad drubbing by Mr. Reagan here might derail President Ford ? particularly should it be coupled by a Reagan upset win in the Ohio primary the same day . Thus , Mr. Ford wants and probably needs to make a respectable showing here . Further , he is hoping for a victory , although he is not expecting it . The Ford camp is certain that a win here would catapult the President immediately into a certainty of a first-ballot triumph . The Ford California campaign foray is being limited , however , because of a lack of funds , observers here note . As a result of the tightness of funds , Mr. Ford is not expected back in the state before the primary after his current tour , which ends Wednesday ( May 26 ) .                 @ @ @ @
