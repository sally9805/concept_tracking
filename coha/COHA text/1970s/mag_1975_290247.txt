Is " national security " a legitimate legal defense against charges of criminal activity ? Last week , in two different cases , the Justice Department was answering yes and no . <P> One case involves John Ehrlichman and three White House plumbers who are appealing their conviction for the break-in at the office of Daniel Ellsberg 's psychiatrist . During the trial , the judge refused to allow national security to be used as a defense ; but in the appeal argued last week , Ehrlichman et al . renewed their claim that Ellsberg was regarded as a threat to national security , since the White House did not know whether he had stolen other secrets besides the Pentagon papers . The Justice Department , urging that the convictions be upheld , contends that the break-in was plainly illegal and can not be justified by national security claims . <P> Ehrlichman 's lawyers are vigorously citing another case in the D.C. court of appeals . In that one , the FBI , with approval by then Attorney General John Mitchell , bugged the headquarters of the Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bertram Zweibon , a former J.D.L. member , and others sued Mitchell and the FBI for damages . At the time its offices were bugged , the J.D.L. was harassing Soviet diplomats in the U.S. as part of its efforts on behalf of Soviet Jews . The league lost its case at the trial when the judge agreed with the Justice Department that the bugging was " a proper exercise of the President 's constitutional authority to conduct the nation 's foreign relations and his power to protect the national security . " <P> The same judges are sitting in both cases , and a Justice Department official , with a lawyer 's infinite capacity to slice fine , claims that the two cases are really entirely different . On the one hand , it is not claimed that the President had specifically ordered the Ellsberg breakin ; and if he had , standard law-enforcement procedure would have been to go through the Attorney General . On the other hand , the FBI was given authority for the J.D.L. bugging by the Attorney General , who has repeatedly claimed the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving foreign powers . How the judges will react to the asserted distinctions remains to be seen .
