txt Once again pressure is on to cut back powers of New York State 's Urban Development Corporation . Two years ago , capitalizing on emotional ? stress following the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King 's assassination , Gov . Nelson A. Rockefeller bulldozed the Legislature into passing the bill that made UDC the nation 's most powerfully endowed urban-redevelopment agency . UDC can literally move into any city and build anything , ignoring zoning laws , building codes ,  --  or other strictures . The fact that UDC 's chief , Edward J. Logue , has delicately avoided flexing these enormous powers has not deterred " home rule " - oriented legislators from trying to undo their earlier action . Now , as last year , the House of Representatives has voted to pull the tiger 's teeth by requiring local reviews ( meaning : veto power ) of any UDC project . To become law , the . bill must pass the Senate and get the Governor 's signature . The first is unlikely , the second unthinkable . However , the action is a fingerpost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts police on their beats have taken to LEAPS . LEAPS stands for Law Enforcement Agencies Processing System  --  a new , highspeed police communications and information system . At its completion , set for May 1 , it will link all Massachusetts law-enforcement and related agencies , froM the State Attorney General 's office to municipal police departments serving communities with populations of over 5,000 . Using a Burroughs 5500 computer , LEAPS will provide these agencies with instantaneouns response ? to police inquiries . Information regarding everything from stolen . automobiles to missing persons ? to narcotics will be available within seconds . To office ? on time ! The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority ( MBTA ) is finding that commuters will switch to rapid transit which is as fast and about as comfortable as an automobile . The MBTA currently has 23 buses providing express service for commuters from west of Boston . The most " used of five runs carries a daily average of 3,000 passengers to work . All lines are growing at the rate of 2 to 3 percent a month . Reason for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unclogged morning commuter route to Boston ? the Massachusetts Turnpike . Because traffic volume on this highway is restrained by tolls , vehicles can maintain average speeds of 55 to 60 m.p.h . This means , generally , a quick trip and an on-time arrival at the office . In May the MBTA will be getting 40 new buses for these runs . For commuters in one suburban community , it will mean a reduction in waiting time to three minutes between buses . Operatic entente New England colleges are forming a cultural entente with Boston 's Opera Company . ? The opera , which has lost its home and faces financial extinction , has appealed to area colleges for - support . In response , colleges are pledging financial assistance and are opening their facilities . During  --  this year 's season the company has performed in small college auditoriums , on hockey rinks , and in gymnasiums . " Though we hope to get our own home again , we 've shown that opera does n't have to be in glamorous opera houses , " says James Curran of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make opera more relevant , and the students are helping us . " Target : fresher fish A Norwegian invention  --  plastic fish containers  --  may put new freshness in New England 's famous fish catches . Each plastic box holds about 100 pounds of fish and is sturdy enough to support a hefty three-ton load on top and prevent contents from being crushed . Norwegian fishermen ice and pack their catch as soon as it is caught , thus keeping fish fresh until it reaches port . Back home fish processors steam-clean the used boxes , fill each third one with ice , and return them to incoming fishermen in exchange for full containers . Lack of adequate refrigeration on most New England trawlers vastly reduces the amount of fresh fish reaching consumers . If they adopt the Norwegian technique , it should ensure their obtaining the same price for the first day 's catch as for the last . One New Bedford fisherman already has 100 boxes and is using them on trial runs . Now perhaps the problem of spoiling catches will become a fleeting memory .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
