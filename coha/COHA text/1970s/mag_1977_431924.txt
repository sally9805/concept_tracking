 | Naming Our Second Baby We talked about it for weeks before I lumbered off to the hospital , but we could n't agree on a name for the baby . We were quite firm about the names we did n't want , but we were completely up in the air about what we did want . With a last name like Schwartz ? so commonplace that it fills dozens of pages in every city 's telephone directory ? we felt that we had to find a first name of some distinction , or the poor kid would be forever getting someone else 's telephone calls . So we promptly eliminated the most common names . According to an article I read , the most popular boys ' names of the early 1970s were Michael , David , Christopher , John , James , Joseph , Robert , Anthony , Richard and Brian . The most popular girls ' names were Jennifer , Michelle , Lisa , Elizabeth , Christine , Maria , Nicole , Kimberly , Denise and Amy . All those names were definitely OUT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're a rather small family , yet the names Ruth and David appear over and over again on our family tree . When members of the family get together , there 's bound to be a conversation that sounds like this : Aunt Rose : Did you hear the news ? David was accepted into dental school . Aunt Phyllis : Which David ? Adele 's David or Ruthie 's David ? Aunt Rose : What do you mean , Ruthie 's David ? Ruthie 's David is only 11 . Aunt Phyllis : No , no . Not your Ruthie . Sam 's daughter Ruthie . Aunt Rose : Sam 's Ruthie has no David . You know very well that her son is named Rickie . Aunt Phyllis : Oh , that 's right . Rickie . Yes , I remember now . Wait a minute . . . does n't Mona have a son David ? Aunt Rose ( annoyed ) : No , no , she married a David . Aunt Phyllis : So who got into dental col-lege ? Aunt Rose : Adele 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of names , Ruth and David were , of course , out . And since David is the second most popular boy 's name , it was out twice . We 'd been through this before , 18 months earlier , when our first baby was born . I had picked out a name for a boy : Eli . My husband was not too happy with that choice , but I thought it was distinctive without being pretentious ? just the balance we were striving for . The girl 's name had me stumped . I wanted the name to be just right . But we had gone to the wire without making a decision . I checked into the hospital completely unready . " Wait , " I wanted to shout , " I ca n't have this baby yet ! I have n't got a girl 's name ! " The nurse who attended me during labor was a pretty young thing with blonde hair and a smile that lit up the room . I took to her right away . The name on her tag was Wendy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! My problem was solved then and there , and I relaxed . " You may exit when ready , " I whispered to the struggling little life inside me . So Wendy was born , a dark-haired , dark-eyed , unsmiling baby . ( So continued on page 75 72  | much for the prenatal influence of names . ) And then the comments started . You picked Wendy ? " her grandfather snorted in disgust . " You mean that woman on television who calls everybody bunny ' ? " But Dad , Wendy Barrie has n't been on TV for years and years ! Who remembers her ? " I protested . I remember her , " he answered blackly , " and that 's enough . " I could see poor little Wendy being disinherited because of her name . Then Aunt Phyllis chimed in . " Such a strange name , " she murmured . " It sounds like a nickname . Is n't it short for something ? " It 's a Welsh name , " said Cousin Ruthie ( the intellectual one ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I croaked in dismay . " I did n't know that ! " My husband caught my eye and grinned at me . " Do n't worry about it , " he said sotto voce . " We wo n't tell Wendy a thing about it . She never has to know . " Well , after that surprise , you can bet we were n't going to use another mistake . This time we . : ld do the job right . No hasty , last-minute decisions , no half-researched choices and no foolish outside influences . After all , a child 's name can have a significant effect on her ' development . We would choose very carefully this time . We knew we wanted a distinctive name but , my husband warned , not too distinctive . We did n't want the child to be laughed at . He told me the story of a famous anthropologist , Professor Earnest Hooton , who named his son after his hero , Isaac Newton . Little Newton Hooton must have had a terrible childhood ! My husband pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless mirth in everyone but the child , who would suffer untold torture . One ca n't be too careful . I remember the case of a boy I went to school with , Richard Dockery . I guess his parents never figured , when they named him Richard , that we 'd all call him Dickie . Poor Dickie Dockery must have cried a lot in grade school , but in high school he must have been really miserable then we were calling him Hickey Dickie Dockery . So I agreed with my band that we must approach the problem scientifically . Further complicating the naming continued on page 76  | @# dilemma , my poor husband had major no-no of his own . His name is Ira . That name has given him trouble over the years . He has a vivid recollection of being asked to his driver 's license to a bellicose policeman . The officer looked at the name and asked Ira if he was to pull a fast one . " This is wife 's license , is n't it ? " he took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iris is a feminine name , Ira is indeed masculine . So now Ira was absolutely firm his insistence that names indeterminate sexual origin were be considered . That meant like Gerry , Frances , Marion . Sandy , Sydney and Tracy were out . We went through flower names for girls ( Rose ? Hyacinth ? Petunia ? Pansy ? ) and names of characters from literature for boys ( Be Quixote ? Raskolnikov ? ) . We also tried people we admire . " How about Clarence Darrow Schwartz ? " we 'd ask our somewhat bewildered relatives . " Or Edith Wharton Schartz ? " But when Ira suggested Harpo Schwartz , I called a halt . When the labor pains were coming at five-minute intervals I grabbed my overnight case , my reading glasses and my Name-The Baby Book and yelled to Ira to get the car . While we raced to the hospital I tried out names . " Valeria ? Ursula ? Yolande ? " I asked Ira between " How about Waldo ? Waldo Schwartz sounds very ( gasp ) distinctive. - Ira pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seat . " You named Wendy , " he said decisively , " I 'll name this one . give it another thought . " A boy was born to us that Little No-Name Schwartz we in at just under six pounds . His father bent over us and smiled . filled out the birth certificate . said proudly . " His name 's David . " I could n't believe my ears . David ! The double no-no ? I looked do the little red being beside me . In that moment I forgot all about the thousands of Davids in the phonebook . I forgot all about Adele 's David and Ruthie 's David . 1 remembered only one David . Michealangelo 's . Surely this little son of mine was going to grow up to like that magnificent statue in Florence ? straight , slim and sttrong . " Oh honey , " I sighed happily . " what a perfectly beautiful name .
