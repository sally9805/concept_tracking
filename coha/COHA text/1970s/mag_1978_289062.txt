Vicious WEB , half-baked PIE <P> W.E.B . ( Sept. 13 , NBC , 10 p.m . E.D.T. ) . When the movie Network came out two years ago , rumors ran that the Faye Dunaway character was actually based on Lin Bolen , a onetime programming v.p. at NBC . This was nasty gossip , because Dunaway played a feral TV executive who might run over her grandmother in pursuit of higher ratings . Bolen survived all the talk and has now re-emerged as the executive producer of W.E.B . Set at a fictional TV network , the show is Bolen 's rejoinder to the movie that savaged her . Or at least it is supposed to be . Curiously enough , the heroine of W.E.B . ( Pamela Bellwood ) is also a predatory TV executive , who , in the opening episode , sells out her lover in pursuit of higher ratings . With friends like herself , Lin Bolen does not need enemies . <P> Its tawdry roman clef aspects aside , W.E.B . is not without its amusingly smarmy moments . This show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Network ' s . According to Bolen , TV is run by sex-crazed , alcoholic , pill-popping men whose contempt for the public is exceeded only by their contempt for each other . " Television is a monster that never stops eating , " explains one of them . True enough , but W.E.B . gives viewers that rare opportunity to watch television throw up . <P> Apple Pie ( Sept. 23 , ABC , 8:30 p.m . E.D.T. ) . Other people have bad days , so why should n't Norman Lear ? It must have been a dark afternoon in Beverly Hills when the producer dreamed up this sitcom . A dumb idea , indifferently executed , Apple Pie is easily the worst show ever from the Lear factory . It makes Hot I Baltimore look like Heartbreak House . <P> The charming Rue McClanahan , late of Lear 's Maude , stars as a fey woman who , in the Depression , hires an entire family out of the want ads . Why ? Never mind . Suffice it to say that there are a lot of F.D.R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players , Dabney Coleman is refreshingly laid back as the heroine 's hired fella , but the gifted Jack Gilford is squandered as a crochety blind grandpa . Someone should put Apple Pie back in the oven . - Frank Rich
