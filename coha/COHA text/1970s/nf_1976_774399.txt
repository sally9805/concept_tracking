txt  | made the unified commands their own fiefdoms ; for example , the position of Commander in Chief of the Pacific ( CINCPAC ) is held in trust for the Navy and the European Command is regarded as belonging to the Army . Even a powerful Secretary of Defense like Robert McNamara could not shake the Navy 's grip on the Pacific . Moreover , the unified commanders usually look to their service counterparts on the JCS for guidance and always keep them informed of their every move . As chairman of the JCS , Maxwell Taylor was able to dictate nearly every move of General Paul Harkins , the Vietnam commander . The services have not sent their best personnel to the Joint Staff , nor have they rewarded those who have ignored parochial considerations while wearing the " Purple Suit . " The service chiefs still look to their own staffs rather than to the Joint Staff for guidance on their joint responsibilities . Finally , the chiefs quickly learned that systems analysis was not value free . If the problem was structured in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support his own parochial viewpoint . For example , Navy analysts have argued that the Soviet fleet is superior to that of the United States , while systems analysts in the Department of Defense , using different criteria , have judged the fleets comparable . Fourth , the changes have dealt with the symptoms of the problems and not the causes . The problem of the service chief is not that he can not divest himself of his service duties . The real problem is he does not want to . The man who spends nearly forty years as a follower in his service sees his appointment to the JCS as the opportunity to remake his service in his own image . He does not view it as an opportunity to serve as a principal military advisor to the President and the Secretary of Defense . Recently retired CNO Admiral Zumwalt was so engrossed in reshaping the Navy and so little concerned with his JCS responsibilities that he sometimes skipped JCS meetings . He felt that the chairman , Admiral Moorer , would safeguard the Navy position in the joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JCS or the posi- tion of service chief , most military officers would opt for the latter . Admiral Radford was keenly disappointed when President Eisenhower selected him to be chairman rather than CNO and spent much of his time as chairman trying to run the Navy . None of the changes have altered the format by which the JCS reaches decisions or the process by which men reach the JCS . The remainder of this chapter will deal with the internal procedures of the JCS , while chapter two will analyze the process by which men rise to the top of their service . The Joint Chiefs of Staff meet regularly on Monday , Wednesday , and Friday at 2:00 p.m. in a specially configured room , referred to as " the tank , " just inside the mall entrance to the Pentagon . These meetings are closed to outsiders and no transcripts are made . Until 1959 not even the Secretary of Defense attended these meetings . In that year , Thomas Gates began to attend at least one of the weekly meetings and his successors have continued the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded favorably to this practice . The chiefs resented McNamara 's intrusion because they felt that he came looking for support for his positions rather than for advice from them . All the secretaries , however , have met with the chiefs on a regular basis in their own office . At each JCS meeting there is a fixed agenda for the chiefs to consider . The agenda items are supported by position papers prepared by the Joint Staff . Most of the items on the agenda are the result of requests from the White House , the Secretary of Defense , or one of the unified commands for a JCS position on a particular issue . A small percentage of the agenda items are generated internally by the chiefs or by part of their organization . Each year the JCS takes action on some 15,000 items , ranging from such  | insignificant questions as uniform design to such far-reaching problems as targets for nuclear weapons . Not all of the problems referred to the JCS are acted upon by the assembled chiefs . In fact the Joint Chiefs act on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The operations deputies come together at 10:00 a.m. to review the day 's agenda and by unanimous consent can approve items themselves . In addition , there are four other ways to remove items from the JCS agenda . First , papers with relatively short suspense dates can be approved by phone votes of service planners . Second , papers submitted to service planners are considered approved at the end of seven days unless a dissenting memorandum is submitted . Third , the chairman may act for the JCS on those matters wherein time factors preclude formal consideration . Fourth , the chairman , the director of the Joint Staff , or the heads of the joint directorates ( J-6 Personnel , or J-4 , Logistics ) may take action on those matters that fall clearly within guidelines previously established by the JCS . The only item that the Joint Chiefs insist on considering personally is a recommendation for the Medal of Honor . The process by which a decision is made within the Organization of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is quite involved , and its outcome is usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each desiring to safeguard its vested interests . The process , known as the " flimsy-buff-green-red striped procedure , " normally begins with a directive addressed to the chairman . The directives are usually in the form of a memorandum and indicate a date for the receipt of a reply . Upon receipt of a memorandum request , the secretary of the JCS ( a one-star flag officer who works for the chairman ) determines the action agency within the OJCS and establishes the due date for action . The due date established is based upon having the final paper ready for consideration by the JCS at two meetings before the time the report must be submitted to the requesting agency . The directive is assigned to an action officer within the agency  | designated by the secretary of the JCS . This officer prepares a report on " flimsy paper " and forwards it to the service action officers for comment . After the service action officers have made their comments , they meet with the OJCS action officer to discuss the flimsy and make recommended changes . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the issues in doubt can not be resolved , it is published on buff paper and circulated within the OJCS for formal concurrence or comment . Changes recommended by the agencies of the OJCS , if acceptable , are incorporated into the buff paper by means of a corrigendum . In the event that there is a divergent opinion within the OJCS on a buff paper which can not be resolved between the agencies concerned , the matter is referred to the director of the Joint Staff for his determination . After his decision , the report is submitted to the service planners . If the service planners approve the buff , it is sent to the secretary of the JCS for preparation on green paper in a final format . If any service planner disagrees , he prepares a memorandum for the OJCS action agency stating the reason he can not concur and recommending proposed changes . If these changes are acceptable to all concerned , they are incorporated into the buff . If they are not , the action agency calls a planners ' meeting to resolve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dissenting service prepares a formal statement of nonconcurrence , which is attached to the green as a supportive document along with the action officer 's opinion of the nonconcurrence . The green paper is then submitted to the operations deputies for their consideration . If the operations deputies can not agree , or if they consider the subject of sufficient importance to require JCS approval , they forward the paper to the JCS for their consideration . If the chiefs agree , they forward it to the requesting agency . If they do not , it is forwarded as a split decision with the views of the dissenting chief or chiefs appended . Once a position has been approved it is issued on " red striped " paper . The entire process generally takes about three weeks .  | The Joint Chiefs agree unanimously on the great majority of issues on which they are asked to reach a decision . However , most of the issues are routine and the splits come on the crucial matters of budget ceilings , force levels , and strategy . In the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were relatively common . However , in the mid-1960s , when these military leaders realized that a strong Secretary of Defense , Robert McNamara , was using these splits against them , the chiefs began to work out their differences among themselves , and since that time JCS splits have become fewer . The Joint Chiefs of today realize that , in an atmosphere of hostility toward " things military , " split decisions help neither the military nor their service . In the 1950s and early 1960s , a Bradley , Burke , Ridgway , or Taylor could dissent from his fellow chiefs and receive a sympathetic hearing in the Congress and from the media . These men were well known and the public was sympathetic toward increased defense spending . Dissension among today 's less well known military leaders would be pointed to by congressmen and journalists as examples of military ineptness . The chiefs of today are no less parochial in terms of service orientation than their counterparts of yesterday . However , they know that they can best enhance their service position only by presenting a unified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions of the JCS are often of the least common denominator or cumulative variety . The flimsy-buffgreen-red striped process is designed primarily to protect service positions . Consequently , at each step of the process , in order to please each of the services , the issue is usually watered down or " waffled " so that it becomes meaningless , or service positions are simply added together and labeled as a joint paper . The JCS has become so bogged down in the cumbersome process which is so concerned with protecting each chief 's own service interests that it has become addicted to the status quo and has never been a source of innovation in the national security policy-making process . Policies such as containment , massive retaliation , flexible response ,  | Vietnamization , and detente have been developed with negligible input from the JCS . Lyndon Johnson once complained to Army Chief of Staff Harold Johnson that the JCS never gave him any solutions , answers , or even ideas to deal with Vietnam other than to continue with existing policies . Let us now turn to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JCS and complete this analysis of why the chiefs act the way they do .  | As indicated in table 1 , in the quarter of a century from the passage of the National Security Act of 1947 through the summer of 1973 , twenty-eight men were appointed to the Joint Chiefs of Staff by five Presidents . Six of these officers have served both as chief of their service and as chairman of the JCS . Twenty-one men have served only as service chief , and one man , Admiral Arthur Radford , has served only as chairman . Ten of the officers appointed to the JCS have been Army generals , another ten have been Navy admirals , while eight have been Air Force officers . With the exceptions of General Vandenberg and Admiral Zumwalt , who were some months short of their fiftieth birthday at the time of appointment , the appointees to the JCS have been in their fifties at the time of their initial selection , with an average age of fifty-five years . Hoyt Vandenberg , at forty-nine years and three months , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lemnitzer , at fifty-eight years and ten months , has the distinction of being the oldest man to serve as a Chief of Staff . Tenure on the JCS has varied from as little as seven months to as long as eight years . Carl Spaatz , the first Air Force Chief of Staff , was in office for the shortest time , while the honor of having  | served on the JCS for the longest period of time belongs to Earl Wheeler of the Army , who served under three presidents . Wheeler was Army Chief of Staff for two years and chairman for another six . Both Wheeler and Arleigh Burke , who spent six years as Chief of Naval Operations , hold the record for the longest time in one position . The average time on the JCS for all of the men is a little less than four years . While their time in office has been somewhat shorter than that of the average tenure of the post ? World War II Presidents , the chiefs ' time in office far exceeds that of their immediate superiors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During this same period , ten Secretaries of Defense have spent an average of two years and six months in office . Service secretaries have had an even more rapid turnover . The average tenure of a post ? World War II service secretary has been two years and four months . Thus , in addition to having the edge in expertise over their civilian superiors , the chiefs also possess the advantages that come from longevity in a position . Six chiefs have served with no less than four Secretaries of Defense and another four have worked under three . These two factors , military expertise and longevity in office , compound the problems faced by civilian secretaries who wish to impose their will on this military elite . As we shall see in subsequent chapters , the JCS eventually " outlasted " Secretaries of Defense Forrestal and McNamara in office and achieved policies to which these two civilian secretaries were opposed . The members of the JCS are fairly evenly distributed both by state and by region . As is indicated in table 2 , the twenty-eight chiefs came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three men to the JCS . Their regional distribution closely parallels the population density of the various sections . The more populous Northeast and Midwest have each contributed ten men , while the less populous South and Far West have produced five and three chiefs , respectively . Although there is no evidence to support any connection between origin and subsequent behavior , this even  | distribution of the members of the JCS is somewhat surprising in view of previous studies on the origins of the officer corps which have found the South overrepresented in that group . For example , Morris Janowitz discovered that 30 percent of the officers in the armed forces in 1950 were from the South . Table 3 contains a list of appointees by administration . President Eisenhower , who served longer than any of the other Presidents in the past twenty-five years , appointed nine men to the JCS . President Truman , who made the initial appointments to the JCS , named seven officers . Lyndon Johnson named four men to the Joint Chiefs and promoted a Kennedy appointee , Earl Wheeler , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , John Kennedy also made four new appointments , and recalled to active duty Eisenhower 's Army Chief of Staff , Maxwell Taylor , to be his chairman . In his first four years in office , Richard Nixon appointed four new men to the JCS and promoted Johnson appointee Thomas Moorer from CNO to chairman . Thus each postwar President has had the opportunity to make an ample number of selections to the Joint Chiefs of Staff , an average of about one  | appointment for each year in office . However , many of the appointments to the JCS have come near the end of presidential terms . For example , Lyndon Johnson made two appointments in his last year and Nixon three . Thus , the incoming President has normally spent his first few years in office working with military advisors selected by his predecessors , and , except for Eisenhower , who replaced the entire four men within his first six months in office , the Commanders in Chief have allowed the holdover chiefs to complete their full terms . Sixty-eight percent of the chiefs have served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to make an appointment to the JCS , the President 's options are still constrained . His field of choice is usually limited to a few top men in each branch of the armed forces , whose promotion into this elite group is rigidly controlled by the individual service . Chief executives who have been inclined to go significantly below the normal zone to elevate an officer with whom they are acquainted personally or by reputation have usually been persuaded not to do so . For example , in 1962 President Kennedy 's advisors talked him out of appointing to the JCS a then  | 47-year-old major general named Westmoreland , who had impressed the President during a visit to West Point . Likewise , in 1972 Richard Nixon was dissuaded by Pentagon officials from naming as Army Chief of Staff Brigadier General Alexander Haig . Haig had performed brilliantly as Henry Kissinger 's deputy and had undertaken many difficult diplomatic missions for the President and Nixon was anxious to place him on the JCS . However , Haig was junior to 240 other Army generals ! Generally , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men from whom he must make his selection . In 1963 , President Kennedy selected David McDonald to succeed the troublesome George Anderson as CNO although he had never met McDonald and knew nothing of his policy positions . Moreover , even when a chief executive does not like the policy views of a potential chief , oftentimes he must select him as the " best of the worst . " Thus , President Eisenhower was put into the position of having to place on the JCS General Maxwell Taylor , a man whose views on Eisenhower 's policy of massive retaliation were completely opposed to his own . Likewise , John Kennedy 's first appointment to the JCS was Curtis Lemay , who could hardly be considered sympathetic to the style or substance of the New Frontier , and whose opposition to the Kennedy strategy of flexible response was well known . The service , through its absolute control over the promotion system , is responsible for placing the officer in the field from which chiefs are selected . Since 1915 advancement through the two-star or 0-8 level has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service . Occasionally political leaders may set some guidelines for the promotions , but the actual selection is left to military officers , who can easily circumvent these guidelines if they wish . For example , during his time in office , Secretary of Defense McNamara , in order to get less parochial general officers , stipulated that joint service was to be a prerequisite for flag selection . The services easily got around this guideline  | by so broadly interpreting the concept of joint service that the stipulation was meaningless . Civilian leaders who have tried to get involved in the selection process have met determined resistance from the military . Secretary of the Navy Francis Matthews tried to block the promotion of Arleigh Burke to rear admiral by attempting to remove his name from the list chosen by the promotion board . Burke not only was promoted to admiral but also became Chief of Naval Operations . Three- and four-star appointments are not made by the formal selection boards used for the lower ranks . However , with few exceptions , these promotions are still controlled by the services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The exceptions include the members of the JCS themselves , the directors of the joint service high-level schools , and positions within the Office of the Secretary of Defense . The sanctity of service control over the promotion system was underscored again when Secretary of Defense Schlesinger tried to take personal control over the threeand four-star appointments . Schlesinger 's attempts to intervene even at this high level have aroused wide resentment among the services and Congress . While the service alone is responsible for creating the field from which the chief will be chosen , the responsibility for the actual selection has been quite diffused . During the past twentyfive years no single pattern for choosing a member of the JCS from the field has emerged . On various occasions the Secretary of Defense , the service secretary , or even the outgoing chief has been the dominant influence in the selection process , sometimes prevailing upon the President to select an individual to whom he is opposed . However , there have been other occasions where the chief executive himself has played the dominant role in choosing the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President and the secretaries , the role perceptions of the individuals involved , and the prevailing domestic and international political climate . As Jerry Friedheim , former Assistant Secretary  | of Defense for Public Affairs , so aptly put it , " Circumstances pick Chiefs of Staff . " Because circumstances do pick Chiefs of Staff , it is sheer folly to speculate that certain individuals are predestined to become members of the JCS . Currently , many Army officers and political commentators are speculating that newly selected Colonel Peter Dawkins ( West Point , 1959 ) is a shoo-in for Chief of Staff . Earl Blaik , Dawkins 's football coach at West Point , is alleged to have remarked as far back as 1959 , " someday if he stays in the Army , Dawkins will be Chief of Staff . " However , even if the Army should promote Dawkins to full general some ten years from now , the Secretary of the Army , the Secretary of Defense , or the President may still decide that another four-star general is more to their liking for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable in another command , for example , NATO , to move him to Washington . This was the case with General Andrew Goodpaster , who , like Dawkins , is a Princeton Ph.D . Although Goodpaster is a close friend of President Richard Nixon , he was not appointed as Chief of Staff during Nixon 's tenure because the President felt he was irreplaceable at NATO . From his days at West Point , First Captain William Westmoreland , many people felt , was an inevitable choice to be Chief of Staff . But not many people placed his classmate Creighton Abrams in the same category . How many people heard of George Decker or Frederick Weyand before unexpected vacancies thrust them onto the JCS ? The Secretary of Defense has been personally responsible for elevating several men to the JCS . Secretary Charles Wilson prevailed upon Eisenhower to select Admiral Radford as chairman of the Joint Chiefs after Radford had been recommended to Wilson by Senator Taft ( R-Ohio ) . After allowing other people to make the initial selections to his JCS , Robert McNamara fired three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could work . Melvin Laird selected the dynamic young Admiral Zumwalt over thirty-seven other admirals to be Chief of Naval Operations  | in order to attempt to alter the traditional behavior patterns of the entrenched naval bureaucracy . Zumwalt was recommended to Laird by former Navy Secretary and Laird confidant Paul Nitze . Laird also insisted that President Nixon name General Abrams to the JCS , in spite of his age and poor health , because of the general 's fine performance in Vietnam and his support for the administration 's Vietnamization program . On a few occasions a service secretary 's voice has been dominant in the selection process . Navy Secretaries Charles Thomas and John Connally insisted that Arleigh Burke and George Anderson be their respective CNOs . Thomas was a personal friend of Burke 's , while Connally interviewed approximately a hundred admirals before choosing Anderson . Sometimes the outgoing chief is asked to recommend a successor and on some occasions he has had the opportunity to select his own relief . The first five Air Force Chiefs of Staff essentially handpicked their own successors by making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the end of their own terms . In this way , Generals Vandenberg , Twining , White , Lemay , and McConnell were succeeded by men whose careers and outlooks closely paralleled their own . Chief of Naval Operations David McDonald consciously groomed his fellow naval aviator , Thomas Moorer , to succeed him by placing Moorer in command of both the Atlantic and Pacific fleets . Maxwell Taylor had President Kennedy select his protege , Earl Wheeler , to serve as Army Chief of Staff , and Wheeler was responsible for his operations deputy , Harold Johnson , moving up to take his place when he succeeded Taylor as chairman . While the Secretary of Defense , the service secretary , or the outgoing chief may have been the primary mover in the selection of a chief , the President is usually not opposed to their choice . However , on at least two occasions subordinates have convinced the President to nominate to the JCS a man to whom the chief executive was personally opposed . President Eisenhower was ini- tially cool to the appointment of Admirals Radford and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the admirals , " but gave in to the strong pleadings of Secretaries Wilson and Thomas . Finally , there have been instances when the President himself has been directly involved in the selection process . President Eisenhower personally chose as his Army Chiefs of Staff three men who had worked closely with him in World War II . Moreover , Eisenhower 's first choice as Chief of Naval Operations was Robert Carney , who had worked with him during his own days at SHAPE ( Supreme Headquarters , Allied Powers , Europe ) . John Kennedy brought Maxwell Taylor out of retirement to serve as his chairman because of the respect that he had gained for Taylor during his days in the Senate and from Taylor 's book The Uncertain Trumpet . Finally , Lyndon Johnson selected William Westmoreland as Army Chief of Staff because of the loyal and sometimes public support that Westmoreland had given Johnson 's controversial Vietnam policies and because of the rapport that he and his fellow southerner Westmoreland had developed while the latter was serving as the Vietnam commander . Thus far , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggregate level . However , one should never lose sight of the fact that an officer comes to the Joint Chiefs only by first rising to the top of his service . Therefore , let us now turn to a consideration of the individual careers of those men who have risen to the top of their services and of the field from which chiefs are selected . When the National Security Act was passed in late 1947 , General of the Army Dwight Eisenhower was serving as Army Chief of Staff . However , " Ike " had already expressed a desire to retire from the Army to become president of Columbia University , and on December 1 , 1947 , Omar Bradley , his West Point classmate ,  | was named to succeed him . Quiet and bespectacled , with a professorial look and manner , Bradley was an infantry officer who graduated from West Point forty-forth in the class of 1915 , well ahead of Eisenhower . He did not see action in World War I and spent the inter-war years either as an instructor or as a student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infantry school . His only significant nonschool assignment was as assistant secretary to the General Staff . However , because of his association with General Marshall at the infantry school and in Washington , he became the first member of his class to be selected for flag rank . After World War II broke out , Bradley was placed in charge of the 86th Infantry in Louisiana and then moved to the 28th Division in Florida . He went to the European theater in early 1943 and remained there until the German surrender . Although he did not achieve the notoriety of Eisenhower or the fame of Patton , he was an effective and brilliant field commander , admired by his men and highly respected by his contemporaries . Bradley commanded the II Corps in Northern Africa and Sicily , the 1st Army in the Normandy invasion , and the 12th Army Group in the drive across Europe . The latter assignment was the largest field command in American history . It consisted of four armies and 1.3 million American soldiers . After the war , Bradley became head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position when he was tapped to succeed Eisenhower . Bradley held the Army 's top position for eighteen months when a 1949 amendment to the National Security Act created the position of Chairman of the JCS . When Bradley was named to be the first chairman of the JCS , his vice-chief of staff , " Lightning Joe " Collins , was selected to succeed him as Army Chief of Staff . One of the few Catholics to head the Army , Collins was an infantry officer and a 1917 graduate of West Point . He spent World War I on various posts in the United States , and the greatest part of the inter-war years as a  | student or an instructor . During World War II he was one of the few high ranking Army officers to see action in both the Pacific and European theaters and became one of the most daring and aggressive field commanders in American history . He commanded the 25th Infantry Division in the battles of Guadalcanal and New Georgia . During those engagements , his battlefield exploits earned him a Silver Star and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Eisenhower and Bradley requested that he be transferred to Europe to participate in the Normandy invasion . Collins led the VII Corps ashore on D-Day and then across Europe to the Elbe . During the drive , he earned a second Silver Star for his daring breakthrough at St. L6 , called by General Marshall one of the greatest feats of American arms . After the war , Collins was assigned to the Pentagon , where he served as the last director of information for the War Department and First Vice-Chief of Staff in the new Department of the Army . Collins served as Chief of Staff until his second two-year term was completed , six months after the Eisenhower administration took office . He was succeeded by Matthew Ridgway , one of his West Point classmates . Like Collins , Ridgway was an infantry officer who missed seeing action in World War I. During the interwar years , Ridgway spent about half of his time as a student , attending both Command and General Staff College and the Army War College , or as an instructor , spending six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of politico-military assignments that took him to such places as China , Nicaragua , the Philippines , Panama , and Bolivia . When World War II broke out , Ridgway was named as Bradley 's assistant with the 82nd Infantry Division and , when Bradley was sent to North Africa , he became its commanding general . Shortly thereafter the 82nd Infantry Division was transformed into the first two airborne divisions in Army history , the 82nd and 101st Airborne divisions . Ridgway was given command of the 82nd and shipped overseas with it to North Africa in April  | 1943 . His division took part in the Sicilian campaign and the Normandy invasion , in the latter as part of Collins ' VII Corps . In August 1944 , Ridgway was moved up to command of the 18th Airborne Corps , which he led in the drive across Europe to the Baltic . Between WW II and Korea , Ridgway saw duty as a commander in the Mediterranean and Caribbean , and in a politico-military capacity at the United Nations and on the Inter-American Defense Board . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pentagon as deputy chief of staff for administration . However , within the next two years a series of unexpected events thrust him into some of the Army 's most prestigious assignments and ultimately to Chief of Staff . In December 1950 General Walker was killed in a jeep accident in Korea and Ridgway was named to succeed him as commander of the 8th Army . Four months later MacArthur was fired and Ridgway succeeded him as the Supreme Commander in the Far East . Two years later Eisenhower resigned from SHAPE to run for President and Ridgway was selected to take his place . After two years in Europe , Ridgway came back to Washington as Chief of Staff . Ridgway 's time as Army Chief of Staff proved to be the most frustrating of his thirty-eight-year Army career . He disagreed with Eisenhower 's concept of professionalism and the President 's ideas on military strategy . Thus , when the end of his first two years in office coincided with his sixtieth birthday , Ridgway asked to retire . His request was happily accepted by Eisenhower . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose career and ideas on military strategy closely paralleled his own . Maxwell Taylor , the soldier-scholar , graduated fourth in the West Point class of 1922 . He was originally commissioned into the Corps of Engineers , but four years after his graduation he switched into the field artillery . Prior to World War II , Taylor spent much of his time becoming proficient in foreign languages . He also attended the Command and General Staff School and the  | Army War College and taught for four years at West Point . When World War II broke out , he was serving in the office of the secretary of the General Staff . However , when Ridgway , his former Spanish instructor at West Point and his classmate at Command and General Staff , requested him as chief of staff of the 82nd , he left Washington . Taylor went overseas as an artillery commander with the 82nd Airborne and fought in the Sicilian and Italian campaigns . Just prior to D-Day he became commander of the Army 's other airborne division , the 101st , and parachuted with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prior to the invasion of Italy , Taylor volunteered to participate in one of the most dangerous missions of the war . He went behind enemy lines to confer with leading Italian figures about the feasibility of an airborne assault on Rome . After the war , Taylor became the second youngest superintendent of West Point and the first U.S. commander in Berlin . He served most of the Korean War as deputy chief of staff for operations and administration , but six months before the armistice Collins placed him in command of the 8th Army . After the end of hostilities , Taylor remained in the Far East and in April 1955 he took over the entire Far East Command . He had only served in that post three months when Ridgway 's sudden retirement left the post of Chief of Staff vacant . Although he too found his years as Army Chief of Staff frustrating , Taylor served a full four-year term before retiring . He was succeeded in July 1959 by Lyman Lemnitzer , who was one month short of his sixtieth birthday . He had graduated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Far East Command . Lemnitzer was an artillery officer who spent the time between the wars alternating between troop duty and service as a student and instructor at various Army schools , including four years at West Point . During this period Lemnitzer acquired a reputation as a brilliant marksman and military planner . Lemnitzer spent most of World War II on the staffs of Eisenhower and Field  | Marshal Harold Alexander . He became renowned for participation in two secret missions . In 1943 , he was smuggled into North Africa to inform French officials of the invasion , and in 1945 he entered Switzerland in civilian clothes to arrange for the surrender of German troops in Italy and southern Austria . Between World War II and Korea , Lemnitzer served in a number of staff positions in Washington and Europe . During the Korean War , he commanded the 7th Infantry Division in some of the war 's bloodiest battles , and at the age of fifty-three was awarded the Silver Star for conspicuous gallantry . From 1952 to 1955 , Lemnitzer served as deputy chief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Far East Command in April 1955 , Lemnitzer succeeded him as commander of the 8th Army , and when Taylor was promoted to Chief of Staff , Lemnitzer took his place as Far East commander . In 1957 , Taylor chose Lemnitzer to be his vice-chief of staff and at the end of Taylor 's tour , thirtynine years after leaving West Point , he was selected by Eisenhower for the Army 's top position . Lemnitzer was in the Chief of Staff position for about one year when the sudden illness of Air Force General Nate Twining left the position of chairman vacant . Since Eisenhower believed in rotating the chairmanship , he moved Lemnitzer up and made George Decker , the vice-chief , the new Army Chief of Staff . Decker , a specialist in logistics and military economics , and with a reputation in Army circles as a brilliant fiscal expert , was commissioned into the infantry after his graduation from Lafayette College in 1924 with a degree in economics . Prior to World War II , Decker spent most of his time on troop assignments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served in the Pacific as chief of staff with the 6th Army . He participated in the New Guinea campaign and the invasion of the Philippines , acquiring a reputation for coolness under fire . General Walter Krueger , commander of the 6th Army , said of him : " You could set a bomb off under his desk and he would n't turn a hair . "  | After the war , Decker was assigned to the Army 's service force , and served as commander of the 5th Infantry Division . He was not involved in the Korean War . Instead , from 1950 through 1955 , he worked in the Pentagon , first as chief of the budget division and later as comptroller of the Army . During the next two years , Decker served in Europe , first as commander of the VII Corps and later as deputy commander of the European Command . In July 1957 he relieved Lemnitzer as the Far East commander , in August 1959 he relieved him as vice-chief , and in September 1960 as Army Chief of Staff . Decker was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Marshall , and the first chief in two decades not to have been a protege of Marshall . Decker served only two years as Chief of Staff and in the fall of 1962 was succeeded by Earl Wheeler . Decker 's lack of dynamism , the fact that he was an Eisenhower holdover , and his involvement with the Bay of Pigs kept him from receiving the normal two-year extension . His successor graduated from West Point with the class of 1932 and was commissioned in the infantry . Prior to the outbreak of World War II , except for a year at infantry school and another at West Point , Wheeler spent all of his service in the field . He spent most of World War II in this country in school and in training assignments . Four months before the German surrender , Wheeler was sent overseas as chief of staff of the 63rd Infantry Division . Except for one year as commanding officer of the 351st Infantry Brigade , Wheeler spent the time between 1945 and 1958 in the Pentagon or on headquarters staffs . In 1958 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Fort Hood and in 1959 he added the additional duties of III Corps commander . From 1960 to 1962 , he served as director of the Joint Staff . One of his duties in this position was to brief candidate John Kennedy on world developments . In March 1962 , Wheeler was appointed as Lauris Norstad 's deputy in NATO with the expectation that he would succeed Norstad when the latter retired in November 1962 . How- ever , in order to remove Lemnitzer as chairman of the JCS " gracefully , " Lemnitzer was given the NATO command and Wheeler was brought back to Washington as Chief of Staff . When Maxwell Taylor left the Pentagon to go to Saigon as American ambassador , General Wheeler moved up to the chairmanship and his operations deputy , Harold Johnson , succeeded him as Chief of Staff . For Johnson this was a fitting reward and tribute to his determination and courage in the face of adversity . Johnson graduated from West Point one year after Wheeler and was commissioned into the infantry . Prior to the war , Johnson served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harbor , Johnson was serving with the 57th Infantry in the Philippines . When the islands fell to the Japanese , he was captured and participated in the infamous " Bataan death march . " The Japanese imprisoned him in the Philippines until late 1944 , when he was moved to Japan and then to Korea . His time as a POW took a terrible toll , and by the end of the war Johnson had lost 80 of his 170 pounds . The American doctor who examined him at the time of his repatriation proclaimed that there was no medical reason why Harold Johnson should have been alive . As a result of this experience , Johnson gained an intense religious faith and zeal that after manifested itself publicly . One of his subordinates remarked that whatever unit Johnson was assigned to had no need of a chaplain . As Chief of Staff , Johnson proscribed foul language by training instructors . Johnson 's internment not only set him back physically but cut him off from the accelerated developments in military tactics that occurred in World War II . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied at both the Command and General Staff and the Armed Forces Staff colleges between World War II and Korea . The outbreak of the Korean War provided him with the opportunity to reenter the Army 's mainstream . Johnson was one of the first Americans into action . He took the 1st Provisional Infantry Battalion into Korea in August 1950 and remained in  | that beleaguered country for fifteen months . He was involved in the defense of Pusan , the pursuit to the Yalu , the Chinese invasion , and the subsequent withdrawal below the 38th parallel . From 1951 through 1960 he alternated between staff duty in Washington and headquarters duty in Europe . He never received command at the division level but was the assistant commander of the 8th Infantry Division for twenty months . In 1960 , Johnson became commandant of the Command and General Staff College and in 1963 was selected by Wheeler to be his deputy chief of staff for operations , i.e. , General Wheeler 's " ops deputy . " One year later when Wheeler became chairman , Johnson was selected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The defense secretary chose him because of his uncritical acceptance of McNamara 's new methods in the Pentagon . After Johnson had completed his four-year term , William Westmoreland , the Vietnam commander , was named to succeed him . Westmoreland 's " promotion " signified a change in our Vietnam strategy but was also a reward for his loyal support for Lyndon Johnson 's war strategy . The " inevitable " general and Time magazine 's Man of the Year in 1965 , Westmoreland graduated from West Point in 1936 and was commissioned in the field artillery . Although he ranked 112th in a class of 276 , he was the first captain of cadets , the regimental commander , recipient of the Pershing Award for military proficiency and leadership , and marked even then as a potential Chief of Staff by his classmates . Prior to World War II , Westmoreland served with artillery units in Oklahoma and Hawaii . In April 1942 , he was sent to North Africa as a battalion commander . He commanded the 34th Field Artillery battalion in combat in Tunisia and Sicily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the Normandy invasion and the drive across Europe , Westmoreland was attached to the 9th Infantry Division . His surehanded manner of command impressed his superiors , including Maxwell Taylor , who recorded his name in  | a " tittle black book " that he used to make notes of exceptional officers . Between World War II and Korea , Westmoreland served with the staffs of the 71st Infantry and the 82nd Airborne divisions and as an instructor in the Command and General Staff and the Army War colleges . He saw action in Korea as commander of an airborne regimental team . From 1953 through 1958 , Westmoreland served in the Pentagon on the Army staff in various capacities , including secretary of the general staff under Maxwell Taylor . During those five years in the Pentagon , Westmoreland took time out to spend three months as a student in the advanced management program at the Harvard Business School . In 1958 , Westmoreland , the youngest major general in the Army , was given command of Taylor 's old unit , the 101st Airborne . Two years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After serving for three years at West Point , Westmoreland spent six months as commander of the 17th Airborne Corps and in January 1964 was detailed to Vietnam as deputy commander of the Military Assistance Command ( MACV ) . In June 1964 , Westmoreland relieved Paul Harkins as commander of MACV and spent the next four years presiding over the expansion of his command from 20,000 men to nearly 600,000 . However , when Westmoreland was relieved of his Vietnam command and arrived at his " predestined " position of Chief of Staff , he did not come to that position in the manner he expected . His reputation as a field commander was besmirched by the disastrous battlefield tactics he employed in Vietnam , and his reputation as a good general officer was suspect because of his insensitivity to the race and drug problems in his command . His contemporaries who had labelled him as a future Chief of Staff now saw his elevation to that position as a graceful way of firing him from MACV . Although he continued to display the same inability to grasp  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to complete a normal four years as Army Chief of Staff . In 1972 he was succeeded by Creighton Abrams , his former classmate and the man who followed him in Vietnam . Rough and rugged in both manner and appearance , the tenth postwar Army Chief of Staff was a cavalry officer who spent all of World War II in Europe with the 4th Armored Division , rising from regimental adjutant to command of a tank battalion . Between World War II and Korea , Abrams attended Command and General Staff College and the Army War College , and he saw duty in Europe with the 1st Infantry Division . In Korea , Abrams served as chief of staff for three different corps . Between Korea and Vietnam , he spent seven years on the Army staff and four years in Europe , commanding the Tank Armored Division and the V Corps . His staff positions included vice-chief of staff under Harold Johnson . In 1967 he became Westmoreland 's deputy at MACV and in July 1968 he became the commander . Four years later , after achieving remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American withdrawal from Vietnam , Abrams was named Army Chief of Staff at the insistence of Secretary of Defense Laird . His confirmation was held up for three months because of allegations that he had been a party to the unauthorized bombing of North Vietnam by General Lavelle . He was completely exonerated and served on the JCS until his untimely death on September 4 , 1974 . His success in Vietnam and as Army Chief of Staff was in marked contrast to his former classmate . When Abrams died , he was hailed by President Ford and Secretary of Defense Schlesinger as a genuine American hero . Army combat officers , from whom the Chief of Staff must be selected , are divided into three branches : armored , artillery , and infantry . The ten postwar Army chiefs , whose background data  | are listed in table 4 , have reflected the strength of their respective branches . Six of the ten Army chiefs have come from the largest branch , the infantry . The artillery branch has produced three chiefs and the smallest branch , the armored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exception of George Decker , graduated from West Point . Decker , who received his commission from the ROTC unit of Lafayette University in 1924 , is one of the eight Army Chiefs of Staff in the Army 's long history who have not graduated from the military academy , but he is the first chief in the post ? World War II era with that distinction . The nine other chiefs represent seven classes from the academy . The classes of 1917 and 1936 each produced two future leaders . J. Lawton Collins and Matthew Ridgway , the second and third postwar chiefs , were members of the class of 1917 , while Creighton Abrams and William Westmoreland , the ninth and tenth chiefs , graduated together in 1936 . Postgraduate education in military schools has been an integral part of a future chief 's career pattern . All of the chiefs except Westmoreland are graduates of both the staff and the war colleges , and two chiefs have found time to attend three military postgraduate institutions . Moreover , Westmoreland did attend the advanced management program at Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and General Staff and War colleges . Westmoreland 's rapid promotions during World War II made him too senior to attend either school . Johnson attended both the Armed Forces Staff College and the Army Command and General Staff College because his four years as a POW of the Japanese during World War II had placed him far behind his contemporaries . Collins spent a year at the Army 's Industrial College . Six chiefs graduated from the Army War College , while Decker , Johnson , and Wheeler attended the National War College . The average age of those appointed to the Army 's top position is fifty-five years . Harold Johnson at fifty-two is the youngest man to reach the top , while Lyman Lemnitzer at fifty-nine is the  | oldest appointee . It has taken an average of thirty-four years of service as a commissioned officer to become Chief of Staff . Earl Wheeler , who was selected thirty years after graduation from West Point , rose most rapidly , while Lemnitzer , who toiled for thirtynine years in the ranks , took the most time . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general officer , with an average of twelve years . Bradley had the least time as a flag officer , while Lemnitzer , with seventeen years , served the longest . Eight of the appointees were full four-star generals at the time of their selection . Abrams , who had been a full general for eight years before being selected , had the most time in that grade . Johnson , who had been a lieutenant general for only one year and was junior to forty-two other officers when he was selected to succeed Wheeler in 1964 , is the lowest ranking officer to become Army Chief of Staff . The ten chiefs who have already completed their terms have served an average of two years and six months in office . The first chief , Omar Bradley , served the shortest time , only one year and six months , while three chiefs , Taylor , Johnson , and Westmoreland , have served the normal four-year term . No Army chief has ever had his term extended beyond the statutory limit . There are three reasons why the tours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal four years . First , one-third of the Army chiefs have had their tours interrupted in order to move up to chairman . Bradley , Lemnitzer , and Wheeler all served rather short times as Army chiefs but spent longer periods as chairman . Wheeler served six years as chairman , Bradley four , and Lemnitzer two . Second , two Army chiefs reached the statutory retirement age after completion of their initial two-year tour and were forcibly retired by administrations whose ideas and styles were not compatible with theirs . Ridgway retired on his sixtieth birthday after only two years as Chief of Staff because his strategic concepts clashed headlong with Eisenhower 's massive retaliation strategy . Likewise , the Kennedy administration allowed George  | Decker , who was a holdover from the Eisenhower administration , to retire in 1962 to make room for their " favorite general , " Maxwell Taylor , and his protege , Earl Wheeler , on the JCS . Decker was not even consulted about his retirement . He heard about Wheeler 's appointment as Army Chief of Staff and Taylor 's elevation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip to Panama . Third , Creighton Abrams died after only two years in office . In analyzing the career patterns of the ten Army Chiefs of Staff , it is clear that there are many paths to general officer . However , after selection to flag rank , it appears that there are seven key jobs at the general officer level which are stepping-stones to the Army 's top position . As indicated in table 5 , four of these jobs can be classified as operational , while another three may be considered staff . The operational jobs are commands at the division , corps , army , and joint or unified levels . Nine of the ten chiefs have commanded at least one division . Two men , Bradley and Lemnitzer , have been in charge of two divisions , but only Lemnitzer has had two different kinds of divisions , the 11th Airborne and the 7th Infantry . Harold Johnson never had his own division but was the assistant commander of the 8th Infantry Division from 1956 to 1957 . Infantry and airborne divisions appear to be slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have commanded infantry and another three airborne divisions , while Lemnitzer had one of each . Only Wheeler and Abrams commanded armored divisions . Seven have had command at the corps level . Maxwell Taylor and Lyman Lemnitzer skipped this level of command on their way to command of a complete army , and Harold Johnson never reached command at the division level . These seven men commanded five different corps , both Ridgway and Westmoreland commanded the XVIII Corps , while Decker and Collins are alumni of the VII Corps . Seven chiefs have also commanded an entire army . Bradley commanded the 1st Army in Europe during World  | War II , Ridgway and Taylor handled the 8th Army during the Korean War , while Lemnitzer and Decker were in charge of the 8th in the immediate post-armistice period . Westmoreland and Abrams were the commanding generals of the U.S. Army during the war in Vietnam . Neither Collins nor Wheeler held command beyond the corps level . The seven men who commanded at the army level also moved beyond this level to what may be called a joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12th Army Group , which comprised four armies , in the latter stages of the war in Europe . Ridgway , Taylor , Lemnitzer , and Decker all moved up from the 8th Army to head the Far East Command . Both Westmoreland and Abrams headed the Military Assistance Command in Vietnam at the same time that they headed the U.S. Army in Vietnam . As MACV , they had operational control over all of the in-country forces in Vietnam . Ridgway had the most experience in the area or joint command level . Immediately after World War II , he headed the Mediterranean Command . In 1951 when Douglas MacArthur was fired , Ridgway succeeded him as commander in the Far East , and in 1952 when Dwight Eisenhower resigned to run for the Presidency , Ridgway took control of the European Command . It seems clear that when the position of Army Chief of Staff becomes vacant , the place to be is the area command where a shooting war is in progress . Six of the last eight chiefs have come almost directly from the Korean and Vietnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were appointed during the lull between Korea and Vietnam , were serving in staff positions in Washington . The prestigious European ( or NATO ) Command does not appear to be a good route to the Army 's top job . Ridgway is the only chief to have held this command , and then only briefly , and Lyman Lemnitzer took over the European Command after having served as Army Chief of Staff and chairman of the JCS.  | Two positions on the Army staff appear to be stepping stones to Chief of Staff . They are the posts of deputy chief of staff and vice-chief . Seven chiefs have held a position at the deputy level and four of these men have moved up to vice-chief . Only Bradley , Wheeler , and Westmoreland did not see service at the deputy level before taking the Army 's top position . Both Bradley and Westmoreland spent the majority of their time as general officers in operational assignments , while Wheeler 's nonoperational assignments were in the joint arena . Collins , Lemnitzer , and Decker all held the number two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top position . Abrams had a tour in Vietnam between his service as vice-chief and as Chief of Staff . In addition to service on the Army staff , the great majority of the future chiefs have held a nonoperational position of high visibility . Four of the chiefs headed military schools . Taylor and Westmoreland were superintendents of the U.S. Military Academy , while Johnson and Lemnitzer were commandants of the Command and General Staff College and the National War College , respectively . Bradley was the first postwar director of the Veterans ' Administration , and Ridgway was the first U.S. representative on the Military Staff Committee of the United Nations . Collins served as the last director of information for the War Department and Wheeler was the director of the Joint Staff from 1960 to 1962 . When the National Security Act was passed , the Navy , like the Army , was headed by one of its five-star officers , Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz . Like Eisenhower , Nimitz had also indicated a desire to retire , and soon after the creation of the Department of Defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Operations by Louis Denfeld , the Commander in Chief of the Pacific . A 1912 graduate of the Naval Academy , Denfeld served  | with a destroyer force operating out of Queenstown Island during World War I. Between the wars , Denfeld spent about two-thirds of his time at sea and one-third in shore assignments . His sea duty was mainly in destroyers . Denfeld commanded two destroyers , two destroyer divisions , and one destroyer squadron . He also spent two years on submarine duty and served as commanding officer of the USS S-24 from August 1923 to June 1924 . Denfeld 's shore assignments were primarily in Washington , serving with the Bureau of Navigation and as aide to the CNO , Fleet Admiral William Leahy . During the first part of World War II , Denfeld was entrusted with the organization and development of a task force to convoy shipping from the United States to the United Kingdom . For the greatest part of the war , Denfeld served as assistant chief of naval personnel and managed the rapid expansion of the naval service . During the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in charge of Battleship Division 9 and participated in the Okinawan invasion . After the war ended , Denfeld served for a year as chief of naval personnel , and then moved to the post of Commander in Chief of the Pacific , with collateral duties as Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet ( CINCPACFLT ) and first High Commissioner of the Trust Territories . When he was promoted to Chief of Naval Operations on December 15 , 1947 , the New York Times commented that he possessed one of the Navy 's most inquiring minds , a keen understanding of the difficulties of unification of the armed forces , a knowledge of the Navy 's air problems , and an appreciation of the public 's interest in the naval establishment and of the public 's right to full information . These qualities of Denfeld , enumerated by the New York Times , proved his undoing as CNO . He attempted to mediate between the Secretary of Defense and his own service in the unification battle and lost the confidence of both . When he finally sided with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House Armed Services Committee that administration policies were seriously weakening the Navy in favor of the Air Force and Army , President Truman offered him a post in the Atlantic or dismissal . He chose the latter and was succeeded by Forrest Sherman , the youngest CNO in history and the first aviator to occupy the position . Sherman graduated with distinction from Annapolis in 1917 . He ranked second in a class of 203 and was a regimental adjutant . During World War 1 he served in the Mediterranean on board a cruiser . Immediately after the war , Sherman commanded a destroyer and then went into flight training . He was designated as a naval aviator in 1922 . For the next twenty years Sherman spent most of his time on aircraft carriers , either as a squadron commander or as part of ship 's company . He served on board the Lexington , the Saratoga , and the Ranger , and commanded Scouting Squadron 2 and Fighter Squadron 1 . His shore assignments included the staff course at the Naval War College , instructor duty at Annapolis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1942 , Sherman served in the war plans division in the office of the Chief of Naval Operations and attended the Atlantic Conference as the naval aviation advisor . In May 1942 , he assumed command of the carrier Wasp . When it was sunk in September 1942 , Sherman was awarded the Navy Cross and sent to staff duty with Nimitz , serving as deputy chief of staff for CINCPACFLT . He was the Navy representative at the initial peace conferences with the Japanese at Manila and was present at the formal surrender aboard the USS Missouri . After the War , Sherman commanded Carrier Division I briefly and the 6th Fleet for about fifteen months . He also served as deputy CNO for operations from December 1945 through January 1948 . While serving in this position , Sherman , working with Lauris Norstad and Clark Clifford , helped draft the National Security Act of 1947 , which preserved the independence of the services in the new Department of Defense . It was Clifford who  | recommended Sherman to Truman after the latter had fired Denfeld . In July 1951 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heart attack and died while on an inspection trip to Italy . Of the four full admirals then on active duty in the Navy , only one , William Fechteler , had not been involved in the " revolt of the admirals , " and on August 1 , 1951 , Fechteler was named to succeed Sherman . William Fechteler was the second son of Rear Admiral August Fechteler and the younger brother of Lieutenant Frank Fechteler , who was killed in World War I and for whom a heavy destroyer was christened in 1945 . Fechteler graduated from Annapolis in 1916 , ranked eighteenth in a class of 177 . During World War I , he served on board the battleship Pennsylvania , the flagship of the Atlantic fleet , in European waters as aide to the fleet commander . Between world wars , Fechteler commanded the destroyer Perry , was a battleship gunnery officer , and held various destroyer staff billets . He also had shore duty at the Naval Academy and in Washington . For the first eighteen months of World War II , Fechteler served as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August 1943 , he took command of the battleship Indiana and in January 1944 became commander of Amphibious Group 8 . In this capacity Fechteler directed ten amphibious operations in New Guinea and the Philippines . Between 1945 and 1950 , Fechteler served as assistant chief of naval personnel under Denfeld , deputy CNO for personnel under Sherman , and as commander of battleships and cruisers of the Atlantic Fleet . On February 1 , 1950 , he was named as the Commander in Chief of the Atlantic Fleet ( CINCLANTFLT ) by Sherman and was serving in that capacity when he was nominated for CNO . In order to sweep Fechteler out of office with the entire JCS in the summer of 1953 , Eisenhower named Fechteler commander in chief of the Allied Forces in Southern Europe and replaced him as CNO with Robert Carney , his Naval Academy classmate .  | Carney also graduated with distinction from Annapolis in 1916 . He saw action as a gunnery and torpedo officer on destroyers in World War I. Between the wars , he commanded two destroyers and a cargo ship and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as executive officer of the battleship California . Carney also served on several fleet staffs , as an instructor at the Naval Academy , and in the Secretary of the Navy 's office . In the initial stages of World War II , Carney was assigned to the staff of the Atlantic Fleet 's support force . There he developed plans for protecting shipping against submarines . In October 1942 , Carny was sent to the Pacific and remained there until the Japanese surrender . From October 1942 till August 1943 , he commanded the cruiser Denver in the Solomons campaign and sank two Japanese destroyers . For the remainder of the war , he served as chief of staff to Admiral Halsey . In this position he formulated the plans for the numerous combat operations in which Halsey 's 3rd Fleet participated and he received the Navy Cross for extraordinary heroism in the Battle of Leyte Gulf . After the war , Carney served as deputy CNO for logistics under Nimitz , Denfeld , and Sherman . In March 1950 , he took command of the 2nd Fleet and six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean . In June 1951 , General Eisenhower selected Carney to be his deputy at NATO and gave him the additional title of commander in chief of the Allied Forces in Southern Europe . Two years later President Eisenhower picked Admiral Carney as the fourth postwar CNO . Carney reached his sixtieth birthday after eighteen months in office , and upon completion of his first two-year term he retired and was succeeded by Arleigh Burke . Although he was one of the best known and most colorful Navy officers , the selection of " 31 Knot Burke " surprised many people . At the time of his selection he was ranked below ninety-two other admirals and was the first two-star officer ever promoted to the JCS . He was so " junior "  | that when he became CNO he was only promoted to vice admiral . Burke graduated from Annapolis in 1923 . His classmates at the Naval Academy recall that he was an exceptionally serious student interested only in learning to be a naval officer . At the academy he had no time either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to World War II , Burke served on battleships and destroyers and commanded one destroyer . His shore duty consisted of assignments at the Bureau of Ordnance and two years of postgraduate work in engineering . In June 1931 , he received an M.S. in engineering from the University of Michigan . For the first year of World War II , much to his chagrin , Burke was with the inspection division of the naval gun factory in Washington . He was sent overseas to the South Pacific in January 1943 and for the next year commanded destroyer divisions and squadrons . From October 1943 to March 1944 he led Destroyer Squadron 23 , the " Little Beavers , " to spectacular victories in the Solomons . The " Little Beavers " fought in 22 separate engagements and sank one cruiser , nine destroyers , one submarine , several smaller ships , and thirty aircraft , and earned a presidential unit citation . Because he once radioed to some transports in his path , " Stand aside . I 'm coming through at 31 knots , " he acquired his nickname @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Burke served as chief of staff to the commander of Fast Carrier Task Force 58 . During the Okinawan campaign Burke was on board two aircraft carriers sunk by kamikaze aircraft . For rescuing several people from these ships and for maintaining control of the task force during the attacks , Burke was awarded a silver star . Between 1945 and 1948 , Burke served with the Bureau of Ordnance again and on staff duty in the Atlantic . In January 1948 he became the assistant to CNO Denfeld in the organizational research and policy division , known as OP-23 . As head of this office , Burke was in charge of preparing the Navy 's presentation for the House Armed Services Committee investigation into the  | cancellation of the supercarrier . Because of the activities of this office , Burke 's name was removed from the promotion list by the Secretary of the Navy , but under pressure from House Republicans , Truman restored Burke 's name and he became an admiral in July 1950 . After the outbreak of the Korean War , Burke became deputy chief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Far East and then took command of Cruiser Division 5 in Korean waters . From July 1951 to early 1952 he served as a member of the United Nations ' truce delegation at Panmunjon . For the next two and a half years Burke was assigned to the office of the CNO as director of the Strategic Plans Division under Fechteler and Carney . In April 1954 he took command of Cruiser Division 6 , and in January 1955 he assumed command of the Atlantic Fleet 's destroyer force . Six months later Carney retired and Burke became CNO . Burke served six stormy years as Chief of Naval Operations and in 1961 turned down President Kennedy 's offer of a fourth two-year term . He was succeeded by George Anderson , a Brooklyn-born admiral who was selected by Secretary of the Navy John Connally after the latter had interviewed 109 admirals , about 10 of whom were senior to the selectee . Anderson graduated twenty-seventh in the Naval Academy 's class of 1927 . After a short tour on board a battleship , Anderson entered flight training and became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he served with fighter and patrol squadrons and on board the carrier Yorktown . During the early days of World War II , he was with the Plans Division of the Bureau of Aeronautics formulating the American aircraft program for the war . In March 1943 he became the navigator of the carrier Yorktown and was aboard this ship for its first six months of action in the Pacific . For the remainder of the war Anderson served on Fleet staffs . From 1945 to 1948 , Anderson was assigned to Navy headquarters , serving as the Navy representative on various joint  | bodies . During the next five years , he commanded two aircraft carriers , attended the National War College , and served on Eisenhower 's NATO staff . From 1953 to 1955 , Anderson was a special assistant to Admiral Radford , the chairman of the JCS . Promoted to rear admiral in 1955 , he commanded the Taiwan Patrol Force and then served as chief of staff to CINCPAC . In 1958 , he reverted to rear admiral to assume command of Carrier Division 6 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6th Fleet , and in 1961 became the first and only Catholic to be named as the CNO . On paper Anderson was one of the most qualified men to become a member of the JCS . In addition to his major Navy commands , Anderson had considerable joint experience . His assignment with the Bureau of Aeronautics in the early stages of World War II involved considerable liaison work with the Army . For his efforts he received an Army commendation medal and the plaudits of General Eisenhower . In the immediate postwar period Anderson worked first with the joint planning staff and on the staff of SHAPE . In the 1950s he was an assistant to the chairman of the JCS and was chief of staff to the unified command in the Pacific . Despite these apparent qualifications , Anderson had a difficult time with a Secretary of Defense who tried to downgrade military judgment . During his two years as CNO , Anderson clashed repeatedly with McNamara over such items as building a common fighter plane for the Navy and Air Force ( the TFX ) and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the summer of 1963 Anderson was named ambassador to Portugal and David McDonald was brought home from London to succeed him on the JCS . David McDonald graduated from Annapolis one year after Anderson and had a career that closely paralleled that of his CNO predecessor . McDonald saw battleship service after graduation and then went into flight training . He became a naval aviator in 1931 and spent the pre ? World War II period in fighter and patrol  | squadrons . McDonald spent most of World War II as a flight training officer but saw one year of action in the Pacific as executive officer of the Essex . From the end of the war until his selection for flag rank in 1955 , McDonald served in the Pentagon with the Bureau of Aeronautics , attended the National War College , served on the staff of CINCPACFLT , and commanded two aircraft carriers . As an admiral , McDonald first served as the director of the Air Warfare Division in the office of the CNO , and then on the staff of SHAPE . In 1960 he relieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieved him as commander of the 6th Fleet . In April 1963 he was " jumped " over twenty-eight senior vice admirals and made a four-star admiral . Simultaneously , he was given command of all U.S. naval forces in Europe . However , less than one month later , President Kennedy announced that McDonald would succeed Anderson as CNO . McDonald became the first CNO in the postwar period to serve a normal four-year term , and in the summer of 1967 , Thomas Moorer was named to succeed him . Like other members of the JCS , during that period McDonald experienced the frustrations of working with McNamara and the young men that he brought into the Pentagon from the business and academic communities . However , McDonald was able to groom Moorer to be his successor and did convince President Johnson to appoint him as the eighth postwar CNO . Like McDonald , Moorer was a southerner , an aviator , and an Annapolis graduate . Moorer graduated with the class of 1933 , saw service on two battleships , and became a naval aviator in 1936 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fighter and patrol squadrons .

For his actions in landing his damaged plane and aiding in the rescue of survivors from the damaged ship , Moorer was awarded the Silver Star . In May 1942 , Moorer was awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross for delivering supplies to a beleaguered garrison and evacuating wounded men . He returned from the Pacific in the summer of 1942 and spent the remainder of the war in the Atlantic theater . Between the end of the war and his selection for admiral in 1957 , Moorer rotated between sea and shore billets , mostly the latter . His sea duty consisted of carrier assignments and command of a seaplane tender . Moorer 's shore billets included work with the Joint Strategic Bombing Survey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff duty . He spent four of his first five years as an admiral in the office of the CNO in various capacities . His only tour away from the Pentagon was a year in the Mediterranean as commander of Carrier Division 6 . However , Moorer 's next five years were spent at sea in some of the Navy 's most prestigious assignments . From 1962 to 1964 , he commanded the 7th Fleet , then spent a year as commander of the Pacific Fleet and two years as commander of the Atlantic Fleet . On June 3 , 1967 , he was nominated to succeed McDonald . Moorer spent three years as CNO before becoming the second naval officer to serve as chairman of the JCS . When President Nixon nominated Moorer to succeed General Wheeler , he startled the Pentagon community by naming 49-year-old Elmo Zumwalt to succeed Moorer as CNO . Zumwalt graduated with distinction from the Naval Academy in 1942 and served as a junior officer on a destroyer in the Pacific during the war . After the cessation of hostilities , he took command of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he assisted in disarming the Japanese . Between World War II and Korea , Zumwalt served on three destroyers and with the NROTC unit at the University of North Carolina . During the Korean War , Zumwalt served as navigator of the battleship Wisconsin .  | Between the end of the Korean War and his selection for rear admiral in 1965 , Zumwalt attended the Naval and National War colleges , commanded two destroyers , and spent seven years in the Pentagon . His Washington assignments included senior aide to Secretary of the Navy Paul Nitze and service in the office of the assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs . After he became the youngest officer ever promoted to rear admiral , Zumwalt assumed command of a cruiser destroyer flotilla . In 1966 he established and directed the Systems Analysis Division of the office of the CNO , and from 1968 to 1970 he was the commander of the naval forces in Vietnam . While serving in Vietnam , Paul Nitze , his former boss as Secretary of the Navy and as assistant secretary of defense for international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laird as a man who could revitalize the Navy in the post-Vietnam period . Zumwalt spent four years as CNO trying to reshape the naval bureaucracy . His changes were popular with most of the enlisted men and junior officers but were resisted by the more senior officers . Zumwalt 's innovations attracted nationwide attention and made him the best known member of the JCS . However , a number of incidents , including race riots on aircraft carriers , marked his tenure in office and he was succeeded by James Holloway III , a third-generation admiral who promised to bring back some of the Navy 's traditions . In many respects , the Navy is not one but three services , and the Navy line officers corps can be broken down into three distinct branches : aviation , surface , and submarine . Of the first nine CNOs appointed since the end of World War II , five have been surface officers and four have been aviators . As yet no submariner has held the Navy 's top position . Louis Denfeld spent two years  | with the submarine branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service was in battleships and destroyers . However , in view of the ever-increasing percentage of resources being devoted to the silent service , it should be only a matter of time before a submariner becomes CNO . Certainly there ought to be one before the end of this decade . Thus far the surface-aviator rotation of the Navy 's top spot has been somewhat cyclical . Three surface officers ran the Navy during the 1950s , three aviators served as CNO in the 1960s , and a surface officer was in charge for the first part of this decade . Table 6 lists the nine CNOs in chronological order , with pertinent background data . The Navy remains the only service to be headed only by graduates of its own service academy . All nine CNOs graduated from the Naval Academy . Two of the chiefs , Fechteler and Carney , were members of the class of 1916 . A third member of that class , Arthur Radford , became the first Navy man to serve as chairman of the JCS . Education at the senior service schools did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ran the Navy through 1961 . Only one of the first five postwar leaders graduated from any service school at any level . Forrest Sherman , the second CNO , attended the staff course at the Naval War College . However , all of the last four chiefs have attended a service level war college , and Elmo Zumwalt also attended the staff course at the Naval War College . The senior course at the National War College appears to be becoming an important stepping stone to CNO . Three of the last four chiefs are graduates of it . Thomas Moorer , who attended the Navy 's war college , is the only CNO since 1961 not to graduate from National . Arleigh Burke , the only CNO and only member of the JCS to hold an advanced degree from a civilian university , possesses an M.S. in engineering from the University of Michigan . The average age of the CNO at his appointment is just over  | fifty-four . Zumwalt , who is one of the two men to reach the JCS some months prior to his fiftieth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Navy 's top position . Carney , who was fiftyeight when Eisenhower moved him up during the 1953 housecleaning , is the oldest . It has taken an average of thirty-three years of service for an individual to move to the top . As might be expected , Zumwalt 's rise was the most rapid and Carney 's the slowest . The recently retired CNO was selected only twenty-seven years after his graduation from Annapolis , while Carney waited thirtyseven years for his turn . All of the appointees served at least five years as a flag officer , with an average tenure of seven years . The time spent as a flag officer for naval officers before moving to the JCS is much less than the other services because the Navy has abolished its onestar or 0 ? 7 grade level . All Navy admirals receive two stars at appointment to flag . Only Carney , who spent ten years as a flag officer , deviates very much from the seven-year norm . Zumwalt is one of three officers who spent only five years as a flag officer before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to his reaching the rank of rear admiral . Zumwalt 's advance from rear admiral to CNO was not exceptionally short for a naval officer . Being one of the Navy 's ten full or four-star admirals is not much of an advantage when it comes time for CNO selection . Four of the nine postwar selectees were not full admirals upon receiving their appointment , and an additional chief had been a full admiral for only one month . Burke was only a rear admiral and junior to ninety-eight other line officers when he was selected . Zumwalt , Anderson , and Sherman were vice or three-star admirals and ranked thirty-eighth , eleventh , and tenth on the seniority list when they were selected . McDonald was promoted to full admiral on April 1 , 1963 , and selected to be CNO on May 6 , 1963 . The Kennedy administration had decided in early 1963 that McDonald would succeed Anderson and promoted him to full admiral before  | nominating him in order to placate naval officers and congressmen who were upset over Anderson 's firing . No CNO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time of selection . The average tenure in office of the Chief of Naval Operations has been two years and ten months . Admiral Zumwalt , who retired as CNO in the summer of 1974 , was only the second CNO to complete a normal four-year tour . David McDonald , who served from 1963 to 1967 , was the first . Not one of the first six CNOs completed a normal tour . Five of them served two years or less , and Burke served a full six years and turned down an opportunity to serve an additional two years . There are several reasons for the relatively short tours of the CNOs . Sherman died after only twenty months in office . Two chiefs were fired for publicly criticizing administration policy : Denfeld opposed the decision of the Truman administration to cancel construction of the supercarrier United States and joined his fellow admirals who " revolted " against the civilian leadership ; Anderson opposed the decision of Robert McNamara to build a common fighter plane for the Air Force and Navy ( the F-111 ) and resisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cuban missile crisis . Carney reached his sixtieth birthday at about the same time that he completed his first two-year term and asked his friend Eisenhower to allow him to retire . Fechteler was a victim of Eisenhower 's promise to Senator Taft to purge the Truman chiefs for supporting the Democratic administration 's foreign policy . Although General Bradley was Taft 's primary target , the Ohio senator insisted that Eisenhower appoint a complete new team and the President " transferred " Fechteler to southern Europe . Finally , Moorer moved up to be chairman before completion of his tour as CNO . Burke 's long tenure in office is paradoxical . He often publicly criticized the Eisenhower administration 's defense policies and Eisenhower accused him of " legalized insubordination . " However , Burke was an excellent administrator , had great support in  | Congress , and , perhaps most important , was able to keep the traditionally recalcitrant naval officers corps under control . For example , when the Eisenhower administration placed the Polaris submarines under the control of the Strategic Air Command , Burke was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Analysis of the career patterns of the CNOs makes it clear that the primary requisite for flag selection in the Navy is deep draft command at sea . All of the future CNOs commanded at least one large ship prior to becoming an admiral . The surface officers commanded battleships or cruisers , while the aviators were in charge of aircraft carriers . Moreover , after flag selection , the path to CNO is also in the operational realm . All of the Navy chiefs have held several seagoing commands as flag officers , while none of them has served in more than one staff billet . Table 7 outlines the career patterns for the Navy 's top men . There are three levels of command in the operational realm . At the first level is command of a division or force of ships . The second level encompasses command of one of the Navy 's four numbered fleets , while the third level includes command in a particular geographic area . Eight of the chiefs held command of a division or force of ships . Only Carney did not hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a ship to Halsey 's staff . The four aviators had command of a carrier division , while the four surface officers were in charge of a group of smaller ships . All of the aviators who held the reins of power in the last decade commanded Carrier Division 6 , while Sherman commanded Carrier Division 1 . Anderson felt that command of a carrier division was so important that he reverted from three to two stars to get one . Four of the CNOs held more than one command at this level . Denfeld commanded two destroyer forces and one battleship force , Burke led two cruiser forces and one destroyer force , while Fechteler commanded both an amphibious and a combined battleshipcarrier force . Anderson is the only aviator to hold more than one  | command at this level . In addition to Carrier Division 6 , the former ambassador to Portugal commanded the Taiwan Patrol Force . Five of the CNOs commanded one of the Navy 's four individual fleets . Each of the aviators had his own fleet , while Carney was the only surface officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mediterranean-based 6th Fleet appears to be the most important stepping-stone to the top . Sherman , Anderson , and McDonald all ran the 6th Fleet at one time in their careers . Burke and Anderson are the only chiefs not to have held command on the area level . Burke came to the JCS directly from command of destroyer forces in the Atlantic , while Anderson came directly from the 6th Fleet . The other seven chiefs commanded in different areas of the world . Sherman , McDonald , and Carney were in charge of naval forces in Europe . Denfeld commanded the Pacific Fleet and Fechteler the Atlantic Fleet , while Moorer is the only man to command both the Atlantic and Pacific fleets . Zumwalt came to the Pentagon directly from his post as commander of naval forces in Vietnam . Thus far , no one has moved up to CNO from the prestigious position of CINCPAC . Staff assignments in Washington do not appear to be vital rungs on the ladder to CNO . All of the chiefs have spent the greatest part of their flag years at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an operational billet . None of the officers has spent more than a single tour on the Navy staff and Anderson never served in the Pentagon after being selected for rear admiral . In recent years , assignment to the office of the Chief of Naval Operations has become the one staff position with some significance . Four of the past five chiefs have headed a division within the CNOs office . Burke directed strategic plans ; McDonald , air warfare ; Moorer , long-range planning ; and Zumwalt , systems analysis . In the immediate postwar era , holding the position of deputy CNO was more important . Burke 's three predecessors were all deputies of various branches . Denfeld , the first CNO appointed  | after passage of the National Security Act , is the only CNO to have headed one of the Navy 's powerful bureaus . He headed the Bureau of Naval Personnel immediately after the close of World War II . None of the first nine CNOs served as vice-chief of naval operations . When the Air Force was made a separate service in 1947 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Forces . After passage of the National Security Act , President Truman selected him to be the first Chief of Staff of the new service . Spaatz graduated from West Point in 1914 and was commissioned in the infantry . However , in 1916 he switched into aviation and went to Europe in World War I , where he became an " ace , " shooting down three German Fokker planes . Between the wars , Spaatz attended Command and General Staff College , served at several air bases , commanded a bomber group and bomber wing , and was on the Air Staff for six years . In 1929 his plane Question Mark set an endurance record by staying aloft for 150 hours . After the outbreak of World War II , Spaatz was sent to Europe , where he remained until the German surrender . During the war , he commanded the 8th and 12th Air Forces , the Northwest African Air Force , and the U.S. strategic air forces in Europe . After the defeat of Germany , Spaatz took command of the strategic air forces in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan . When the Japanese surrendered , he returned to the Pentagon to take command of the Army Air Forces . When he was nominated to be Chief of Staff , Spaatz agreed to take the position only on an interim basis . His long overseas service in World War II had exhausted him , and Spaatz was anxious to retire . His wishes were respected and nine months later his 49-year-old deputy , Hoyt Vandenberg , became the second Air  | Force Chief of Staff . Vandenberg graduated in the bottom 10 percent of the class of 1922 from West Point and was commissioned directly into the Air Service . Prior to the outbreak of World War II , Vandenberg spent considerable time both as a student and as an instructor . He attended the Air Corps Tactical School , the Command and General Staff College , and the Army War College , and was an instructor in flight school and tactical school . Vandenberg also served as commander of a pursuit ( fighter ) squadron and in the Plans Division of the office of the Chief of the Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vandenberg served as chief of staff to Spaatz , first with the 12th Air Force and then with the Northwest African Strategic Air Force . He returned to the United States in August 1943 as deputy chief of the Air Staff . In early 1944 , Vandenberg became head of the air mission to the Soviet Union and in April 1944 was assigned to Eisenhower 's staff in London as deputy commander of the Allied Expeditionary Air Forces . Four months later , he assumed command of the 9th Tactical Air Force , which participated in the Normandy invasion and supported the drive of Allied forces across Europe , making 400,000 flights in nineteen months , destroying 4,000 German planes and 6,500 tanks . In January 1946 , Vandenberg became the first director of Central Intelligence . He served in this position until June 1947 , when he became Spaatz 's deputy , his vice-chief of staff . Vandenberg 's second two-year term expired in the spring of 1952 . Because the Korean War was still in progress and because he had decided not to seek reelection , President Truman extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vandenberg did not step down from the Air Force 's top position until June 30 , 1953 , after five years and two months in the post . He was succeeded by Nathan Twining , who had been his vice-chief of staff since July 1950 . Twining graduated from West Point five years before Vandenberg with the class of 1918 . He stood in the  | middle of his class and was commissioned into the infantry . Twining saw brief service in World War I and attended the Infantry School immediately after the war . He entered flight training in 1923 and was transferred to the Air Service in 1926 . Prior to World War II , Twining attended Command and General Staff College and the Air Corps Tactical School . He also commanded an attack squadron and served in a variety of technical assignments at various air fields . Twining saw action in both the Pacific and European theaters and with the tactical and strategic air forces during the War . He served in the Pacific for eighteen months , first as chief of staff to the commander of Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 13th Air Force and as commander of all U.S. and Allied air forces in the Solomons . Twining was shot down in January 1943 and was adrift for six days in a life raft before being rescued . In November 1943 , he took command of the 15th Air Force in Italy and of all the Allied strategic air forces in the Mediterranean . After the surrender in Europe , he returned to the Pacific to assume command of the 20th Air Force . It was a plane from this unit which dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima . After the war , Twining took command of the Air Material Command and then the Alaskan Command . In July 1950 , he became deputy chief of staff for personnel and three months later moved up to be the vice-chief of staff . After four years as Air Force Chief of Staff , Twining became the first Air Force officer to become chairman of the JCS and he was succeeded as Chief of Staff by Thomas White , his own deputy . White is the youngest man ever to graduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nineteenth birthday when he graduated with the class of 1920 and was commissioned into the infantry . After attending infantry school and serving with an infantry division , White entered flight training . In 1925 he became a member of the Air Service , but did not spend much time in aviation billets . Over the next fifteen years he studied Chinese in Peking and  | served as an attache in the Soviet Union , Italy , Greece , and Brazil . His other assignments included Command and General Staff College , language studies at Georgetown University , and staff duty on the Air Staff . White spent the first three years of World War II in the United States as chief of staff for the 3rd Air Force in Tampa , Florida , and as assistant chief of the Air Staff for intelligence . He was assigned to the Southwest Pacific in September 1944 as deputy commander of the 13th Air Force and in June 1945 took command of the 7th Air Force during the Okinawan campaign . After the war , White became chief of staff of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force . He returned to the Pentagon in 1948 and remained there for the next thirteen years . White served successively as the legislative liaison , as a member of the Joint Strategic Survey Committee , and as deputy chief of staff for operations before becoming Twining 's vice-chief of staff in June 1953 . When White became Chief of Staff in 1957 , he selected the world renowned Curtis Lemay as his vice-chief of staff . Four years later , when White completed his term , Lemay was moved up to the Air Force 's top position . For Lemay it marked the final achievement of a distinguished military career , which almost never was . Lemay did not graduate from West Point but from Ohio State . He wanted to attend the military academy but did not receive a congressional appointment . Still interested in a military career , Lemay joined the ROTC at Ohio State and was commissioned in 1928 . One year later he completed flight training and was assigned to a fighter squadron . After serving with fighter units for seven years , he transferred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lemay , who was an excellent navigator as well as an outstanding pilot , pioneered air routes over the North and South Atlantic . After the outbreak of the war , Lemay organized the 305th Bombardment Group and led it into aerial combat in Europe in the autumn of 1942 . This unit was one of the first bombardment  | units to enter combat and under Lemay 's direction startled military strategists by not using evasive action on its bombing runs . In September 1943 , at the age of thirty-seven , Lemay became the Army 's youngest general and was placed in command of the 3rd Bombardment Division . As commanding officer of this unit , Lemay led the famed Regensberg raid , a B-17 shuttle mission that originated in England , struck deep in Germany , and terminated in Africa . In the summer of 1944 , he was transferred to the Pacific , where he directed the 20th Bomber Command in the ChinaBurma-India theater . In early 1945 Lemay took over the 20th Air Force and personally led the low-level night-time incendiary attacks on Tokyo . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20th Air Force to Twining and became chief of staff for the U.S. strategic air forces in the Pacific . After the war , Lemay spurned an offer from Ohio 's Governor Frank Lausche to fill Ohio 's vacant Senate seat and became deputy chief of staff for research and development . In late 1947 , he was selected to be the commanding general of the American air forces in Europe and directed the Berlin Airlift . A year later , at the age of forty-two , Lemay became a full general and was named as the first head of the newly formed Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) . Lemay developed SAC into such an efficient and reliable deterrent that Winston Churchill credited him with saving the Western World . After nine years at SAC , Lemay moved in as White 's deputy . Lemay served as the head of the Air Force for nearly the full four years . However , his longevity in office was more the result of political realities than his success as a military executive . After Lemay 's first two years as Chief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Lemay 's term expired at the same time as that of CNO Anderson , who was also considered a liability . The President did not want to fire two chiefs at the same time , so he gave Lemay , who had more support in Congress than Anderson , a partial one-year reappointment . However , one year later , in the  | summer of 1964 , Lyndon Johnson was campaigning against Barry Goldwater , and , in order to prevent Lemay from getting involved in the campaign , his term was extended until after the election . Thus , after three years and eight months as Chief of Staff , Lemay was succeeded in January 1965 by John P. McConnell , who had been vice-chief since August 1964 . John McConnell graduated from West Point in 1932 , a classmate of General Earl Wheeler . Unlike most cadets , McConnell had already graduated from college before he went to the military academy . In his senior year at the military academy , McConnell was selected to be first captain of the corps of cadets , West Point 's highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and received his wings in 1933 . Prior to World War II , McConnell served with a fighter squadron and in the training command . He spent the first two years of the war in this country on the Air Staff and in the training command . McConnell was assigned to India in late 1943 and remained in that theater until the end of hostilities , serving in various staff capacities . After the war , McConnell , who was already a general officer , spent two years in China as an air advisor to the Chinese government . He spent the period from 1947 to 1950 in the Pentagon . For the next twelve years McConnell worked with the Strategic Air Command in various capacities . He commanded two of SAC 's air forces , served as director of plans , and finally as vice-commander in chief . In 1962 he was selected as Lemnitzer 's deputy in Europe and in August 1964 became Lemay 's vice-chief . McConnell served four and one-half years as Air Force Chief of Staff . His second two-year term expired ten days after Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months before naming McConnell 's vice-chief , John Ryan , to succeed him . Ryan graduated from West Point in 1938 and received his pilot 's wings in 1939 . He saw limited action in World War II , spending most of the war in the training command . Ryan went to Europe in early 1944 , where he was the commander of a bomber group .  | For the next twenty years Ryan spent his time working his way up to the top of the Strategic Air Command . He commanded two bomber wings , two divisions , and two of SAC 's air forces . He also served as SAC 's director of material and as vice-commander before becoming the head of SAC in December 1964 . In those twenty years , Ryan 's only assignment outside SAC was a one-year tour as Inspector General of the Air Force . After two years as commander of SAC , Ryan was named commander of all the air forces in the Pacific . He spent seventeen months in this position before moving up to vice-chief in August 1968 . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ryan was succeeded by George Brown , the head of the Systems Command . Brown was the first officer to become Air Force Chief of Staff without having served first as vice-chief . Brown graduated from West Point in 1941 and became a pilot a year later . During World War II , he saw considerable action in Europe as part of the 93rd Bombardment Group , winning a Distinguished Service Cross and a Silver Star for daring raids behind enemy lines , including the famous low-level raid on the oil refineries at Ploesti , Rumania , on August 1 , 1943 , in which fifty-four planes were shot down . For the next thirty years Brown 's career was completely different from those of his predecessors . He attended the National War College and was associated with several types of aircraft commands , including tactical , transport , and intercepter . Brown spent seven years in the Pentagon but primarily in the joint arena . He was a military assistant to Secretaries of Defense Gates and McNamara , assistant to Chairman of the JCS Earl Wheeler , and headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the military services . From August 1968 to September 1970 , Brown commanded the 7th Air Force in Vietnam , and from September 1970 through August 1973 he was the commander of the Air Force Systems Command . For two reasons , many people speculated , when Brown was appointed to the JCS , that he would soon move up from Air Force  | Chief of Staff to chairman . First , it was the Air Force 's " turn " to hold the top position . An Air Force officer had been chairman only three of the preceding twenty-five years . Second , Brown 's previous experience in the joint arena seemed to make him well qualified for the chairmanship . Thus , it came as no surprise that when Moorer retired as chairman in the summer of 1974 , Brown was named to succeed him . The only surprise was that Brown moved up so quickly . The expectation was that Moorer 's term would be extended to allow Brown to serve at least two years as Air Force chief . However , Moorer 's connection with the purloining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeoman made him a political liability and his term was not extended . Thus , Brown became chairman after less than a year on the JCS . The Air Force is composed of both flying and nonflying officers . The latter handle the support functions ( for example , intelligence , administration ) which are necessary for the conduct of flight operations . The flying officers are divided into pilots and nonpilots ( navigators , bombardiers , etc . ) . Although any Air Force officer can serve as the Chief of Staff , all of the chiefs have been pilots . One nonflying officer did rise as high as vice-chief . William ( Bozo ) McKee , whose specialty was logistics , was Lemay 's vice-chief from 1961 to 1964 . The Air Force was " granted its independence " from the Army by the same act which created the Department of Defense and the JCS . Therefore , each of the Air Force Chiefs of Staff has also been a member of the JCS . Table 8 contains a chronological list of these men with their pertinent background data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military academy at West Point . Curtis Lemay , who applied to the academy but was not appointed by his congressman , received his commission in  | 1928 from the Army ROTC at Ohio State . Since the Air Force Academy did not begin operations until 1955 , the Air Force 's future chiefs can not come from its own academy until 1990 at the earliest , and most of its leaders will continue to be products of an Army school . To date , postgraduate training at service schools has not been particularly important in the careers of the Air Force chiefs . Three of the last four chiefs have not attended any of the schools , and only Vandenberg attended both a staff and a war college course . However , this situation should change in the future . Many of the chiefs were promoted so rapidly in World War II that they were too high up in rank to attend a service school . For example , Lemay and McConnell were lieutenants at the outbreak of World War II and therefore too junior to attend the Staff College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both flag officers and therefore too senior for any of the war colleges at any level . The average age of the Air Force chiefs at the time of their selection is fifty-four . Hoyt Vandenberg , who took office three months after his forty-ninth birthday , is the youngest man ever to serve on the JCS . John McConnell , who had already graduated from college before entering West Point , is the oldest man to take over the Air Force 's number one position . He was fifty-seven when he succeeded Curtis Lemay in 1965 . It took the eight chiefs an average of thirty-three years to climb the promotion ladder . Vandenberg 's rise was the most rapid ; the second Air Force Chief of Staff succeeded Carl Spaatz after only twenty-five years of service . Thomas White , who spent thirty-seven years in the service before taking over in 1957 , holds the distinction of being the chief with the longest period of service . White , who became Chief of Staff nine years after Vandenberg , graduated from West Point two years ahead of Senator Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have spent as general officers is fourteen years . As might be expected , Vandenberg spent the shortest time as a flag officer . He was elevated to the top spot six years  | after making flag rank . John McConnell , who spent more than two-thirds of his military career as a flag officer before becoming chief , served the longest . All of the Air Force chiefs were already full generals before being selected and had spent an average of four years in that grade . All of the chiefs , except Lemay , spent approximately the same time as full generals . Lemay received his fourth star at the age of forty-two because of his accomplishments with the Strategic Air Command and had ten years in that status before being appointed to the JCS by John Kennedy . Upon being selected as the first Air Force Chief of Staff , Carl Spaatz , who was exhausted by the rigors of World War II , agreed to serve only on an interim basis . After seven months President Truman appointed Hoyt Vandenberg as the first permanent Air Force Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his six successors has been just under four years . Three of the chiefs have deviated slightly from the normal four-year tour , while one served less than a year . Vandenberg served just over five years and McConnell just over four years , while Lemay held office a little less than four years and Brown less than one year . Vandenberg and McConnell had their tours extended because of administration changes in the midst of ongoing wars . Lemay owed his unusual tour length to his support in Congress and in the Republican Party . Brown 's short tour was occasioned by Moorer 's difficulties . Because of the rapid promotions of the Air Force chiefs during World War II , no clear pattern was developed for selection to flag officer . However , as indicated in table 9 , after one becomes a general officer there are certain key positions in the operational and staff areas that lead to Chief of Staff . On the operational side there appear to be three stepping-stones to the top : command of an air force , an area command , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed at least one air force and between them they have commanded nine different ones . Twining commanded three air forces , while White , McConnell , and Ryan each directed two .  | The 2nd and 20th Air Forces were each commanded by two different chiefs . Five of the chiefs held Air Force area commands . Vandenberg , White , and McConnell never held an operational command above the level of the individual air force . However , both Vandenberg and McConnell were deputies to commanders in the European area , and White was chief of staff to the Pacific area commander . None of the five area commanders has headed the same section of the world . Spaatz commanded the air forces in Africa , Twining in Alaska , Lemay in Europe , Ryan in the Pacific , and Brown in Vietnam .  | The five area commanders have also been type commanders , and three of these five type commanders have been in charge of the Strategic Air Command . Spaatz , Lemay , and Ryan were all SAC commanders , and McConnell was a SAC vice-commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move up to chairman , came to the JCS from the Systems Command and Material Command , respectively . In the staff area , the single most important position has been vice-chief of staff . Prior to the appointment of George Brown in August 1973 , every chief had served as vice-chief of staff immediately prior to moving to the top . Moreover , some of these men served in the Air Force 's number two position for considerable periods of time . Both White and Lemay were the number two man for four-year periods , while Twining and Vanderberg occupied the position for three years . Service as a deputy chief used to be quite necessary . The first five chiefs had also been deputies in different areas . However , none of the past three leaders had ever seen service on the deputy level . George Brown came from a different mold than most of his predecessors . He has spent his operational career in the nonstrategic area and his staff service in the joint arena as assistant to both the chairman of the JCS and the Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served first as a service chief . Radford came to the chairmanship directly from an operational command . Radford graduated from the Naval Academy in 1916 , in a class that also produced two other men who would become members of the JCS , Admirals Fechteler and Carney , and a total of forty admirals . After graduation , Radford served with the battleship South Carolina in the Atlantic during World War I. When the war ended , he entered flight training and  | was designated as an aviator in 1921 . Before Pearl Harbor , Radford alternated between sea duty with aviation units and shore duty in the Navy 's Bureau of Aeronautics . In the early days of the war , he was the director of aviation training for the Navy . From September 1943 to April 1944 he was in command of a carrier task group that operated against the Japanese on Baker , Makin , and Tarawa . After six months in Washington as assistant to the deputy CNO for Air , Radford returned to the Pacific as commander of Carrier Division 6 for the remainder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteen months as deputy CNO for Air and then took command of the 2nd Fleet . In January 1948 , he was appointed by Denfeld as vice-chief of naval operations . While in this position he led the " revolt of the admirals " against Denfeld 's decision to acquiesce in the cancellation of the supercarrier United States . When Denfeld was fired , Radford was exiled to the Pacific and made CINCPACFLT . However , the outbreak of the Korean War shifted the nation 's attention to the Pacific , brought Radford back into the limelight and to the attention of Secretary of Defense Wilson . During Eisenhower 's famous preinauguration visit to Korea on board the cruiser Helena , the newly-elected President met with Radford and approved him as chairman of the JCS . Although Radford wanted to be Chief of Naval Operations , he agreed to become chairman because he felt that he , like Bradley , would receive a fifth star . Radford served four years as chairman , and when it became clear that he would not receive his fifth star , he refused Eisenhower 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law specifies that a uniformed officer of any military service may be appointed chairman of the JCS . Thus far , only representatives of the Army , Navy , and Air Force have been selected ,  | and in view of its comparatively small size , it is unlikely that someone from the Marine Corps will be selected in the future . Since the creation of the position of chairman in 1949 , an Army officer has occupied it for more than half of the intervening years , that is , fourteen years . As indicated in table 10 , four of the eight appointees have been Army generals , while only two Navy aviators and two Air Force officers have held the post . There are no statutes mandating the rotation of the position among the services . President Eisenhower thought that rotation was a good idea and appointed an officer from each of the services during his eight years in office . Presidents Kennedy and Johnson appointed only Army officers , while President Nixon apparently reinstituted the rotation pattern by appointing a Navy and an Air Force officer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eight chairmen is just under fifty-eight years , and there is very little deviation among the appointees . Wheeler , at fifty-six , was the youngest selectee , and Lemnitzer , who  | was the oldest man to become a service chief , is also the oldest man to be appointed chairman . He was sixty-one when he was unexpectedly tapped for the post because of Twining 's sudden illness . All of the chairmen , except Arthur Radford , had previous experience as a service chief , and all of the service chiefs except Taylor moved up to the chairmanship directly from that position . Taylor retired in 1959 and was out of government for two years . After the Bay of Pigs fiasco , Kennedy became disenchanted with his Joint Chiefs and appointed Taylor as his special assistant for military affairs . One year later , in October 1962 , Kennedy selected the scholarly soldier to replace Lemnitzer as chairman . Radford was a likely candidate for CNO until he led the " revolt of the admirals " in 1949 . Most of the chairmen did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving up to the chairmanship . Their average time as service chief was only two years and one month . Twining and Taylor were the only chairmen to complete a full term as service chief , and , as was discussed above , Taylor did not move directly to the top position . Lemnitzer and Brown had very short tenures as a service chief . Lemnitzer had served only fourteen months when General Twining 's illness left the post vacant , while Brown was tapped for the top spot after less than a year on the JCS when Moorer 's activities made him a political liability . The average term in office for a chairman has been just over three and a half years . Three men have served less than the normal four-year term . Twining resigned for health reasons after three years . Lemnitzer was " kicked upstairs " to NATO after completion of his first term so that Taylor 's role as the President 's principal military advisor could be legitimized by making him chairman , and Taylor himself resigned after twenty-one months to take over the embassy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two complete twoyear tours before stepping down . Wheeler , the only chief with significant staff and joint experience before his JCS appointment , was apparently the most successful chairman . He was appointed  | three times by Lyndon Johnson and once by Richard Nixon and served a total of six years . The preceding analysis has indicated some distinctive differences in the backgrounds and career patterns among the men who rise to the top in each service . The information for each of the services is summarized in table 11 . As indicated therein , the " naval aristocracy " has never admitted a non-Annapolis graduate into its highest echelon , while Army and Air Force each have allowed one maverick to become its Chief of Staff . The Army has provided its future leaders with far more postgraduate training than the other services . All of the Army 's leaders have attended the two senior service schools , while only half of the Navy and Air Force chiefs have attended one of the service colleges . The average age and length of service is slightly different for each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is slightly higher because they have not yet had an " under fifty whiz kid , " like Vandenberg or Zumwalt , rise to the top . Time in flag and time as a four-star general officer has been considerably shorter for CNOs because the Navy does not have a one-star general officer rank , and three CNOs have been " deep-selected " ( that is , chosen from below the normal zone from which chiefs are normally chosen ) as opposed to one in the Army and none in the Air Force . Chiefs of Staff of the Air Force have remained in office much longer because only one has moved up to chairman during his tenure , none has died in office , and the only Air Force chief who was fired was retained almost the full four years for , reasons of political expediency . Operational command billets have been important steppingstones in all three services . The Army 's Harold Johnson is the only post ? World War II chief to rise to the top without having held  | levels before assuming their positions as service leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important in both the Army and the Air Force , but of very little significance in the Navy . But , more important , the preceding analysis indicates that small groups of individuals are carefully groomed by the services for the top position after they reach the 0-6 level . The individuals are combat-oriented line officers , usually distinguished graduates of the respective military academies , who have performed well in a variety of assignments . Career patterns prior to the 0-6 level ( colonel or captain ) do not seem particularly important and vary a great deal among the future chiefs . Bradley spent his mid-career years in schools while Lemnitzer was in the field . Moorer spent a great deal of time in the Pentagon while Anderson 's mid-career was at sea . Ryan spent his mid-years in the Strategic Air Command while Brown was in the Pentagon . But , from the 0-6 level on up , each of the services usually makes sure that its future leaders spend some time in certain key assignments . Likewise , conspicuous gallantry on the battlefield does not seem particularly important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others earned little more than combat ribbons . Potential Army Chiefs of Staff must pass through the Staff and War College system prior to flag selection . As general officers , the future chiefs are given command at the division , corps , and area levels , particularly in areas of hot combat , and are assigned to the Pentagon on the Army Staff . Even Earl Wheeler , who had made a brilliant reputation as a staff officer , had to be moved out of the Pentagon for short tours as commander of the 2nd Armored Division and III Infantry Corps , and as deputy commander in Europe , so that he could complete the grooming process . Future Navy leaders must be naval academy graduates but need not be concerned with school as staff assignments . However , prospective CNOs must command at least one large surface ship prior to selection to admiral . After selection , the Navy chief must  | fly his flag at sea as the commander of a division or force of ships and an entire fleet . In order to prepare George Anderson for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from three to two stars to allow him to serve as commander of Carrier Division 6 , a traditional stepping-stone to CNO for naval aviators . The Air Force grooms certain of its pilots to be its future leaders by placing them in charge of an air force , an area command , and a type command , and by seeing that they serve as deputy and vice-chiefs of staff . Even Curtis Lemay , who virtually created the Strategic Air Command , was taken from this prestigious position and placed in the Pentagon as vice-chief of staff so that he would be in line to step in when Thomas White retired . In his study of the military leadership of 1950 , Morris Janowitz found that the majority of the elite nucleus of the services had followed adaptive or individualist career patterns . On the surface , this would seem to contradict our findings about the career patterns of the JCS . However , this is not the case . Janowitz 's findings are consistent with those discussed above . His elite nucleus consists of those who reach the two-star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to officers after they reach that level . Moreover , Janowitz 's adaptive or individualist career pattern consists of unique assignments early in a military career , while our focus has been on the last one-third of an officer 's career where the officer is groomed for Chief of Staff . Finally , Janowitz admits that even those in the adaptive career patterns have had the essential elements of the prescribed career ( for example , war college training ) , and this has been our conclusion . Our study demonstrates how successful the services have been in establishing the field from which the chiefs are chosen . As is indicated in table 11 , 82 percent of those selected for the JCS have already been four-star officers , and in only one case , Arleigh Burke , has a man who was below the top 10 percent of the flag officers been selected as chief . However , this does not mean that the service always gets a particular man . Admiral McDonald may have hand- picked Admiral Moorer as his successor , but Moorer was not able to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Admiral Zumwalt to be his successor . Vandenberg , Twining , White , Lemay , and McConnell were successful in getting their type of man on the JCS , but John Ryan could not pass the torch to General Meyer , the head of SAC and his former vice-chief . However , Moorer and Ryan could not be completely unhappy with their successors . The Navy had deep-selected Zumwalt for rear admiral and the Air Force had already elevated Brown to the fourstar level . From the service perspective these appointments were simply premature . As a result of this grooming process by the services , there are certain similarities exhibited by all the officers who are selected for membership on the JCS . Over 90 percent of the chiefs are products of either West Point or Annapolis . At the time that these men attended the academies , these institutions had only a narrow , singletrack technical curriculum almost devoid of socio-humanistic electives . Subsequent to graduating from either the military or naval academy , more than one-third never received additional education . Of the approximately 65 percent who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nearly all spent it at one of the military 's own colleges . Arleigh Burke and William Westmoreland are the only members of the JCS to do postgraduate work at a civilian university , and only Burke has a masters degree . All of the chiefs are combat-oriented line officers whose main accomplishment has been demonstrated expertise in the weapons of violence peculiar to their own services . It is ironic that no staff officer in the military has ever risen or can rise to be Chief of Staff . Only Earl Wheeler and George Brown have had extensive joint or staff assignments . The Air Force has refused to allow line officers who are not pilots to acceed to their top position . Very few of the CNOs have spent much time in Washington after their selection to flag rank . Army Chiefs of Staff come to the Pentagon direct from the battlefront.  | Finally , all of the chiefs must spend a considerable period of time working their way up the service bureaucracy . The typical chief is in his mid-fifties and has spent about four years as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flag officer , and thirty-three years in his service before appointment to the top position . Only Admiral Zumwalt and General Vandenberg reached the JCS before their fiftieth birthdays or with less than thirty years of service , and only five officers were not full generals or admirals at the time of appointment . Thus , it should come as no surprise that civilian superiors have found that the typical chief is unable or unwilling to rise above the narrow parochial interests of his own service in particular , or those of the Pentagon in general . He is a product of a nearly forty-year socialization process and has had limited exposure to a nonmilitary or even a nonservice environment . With some exceptions , his career has followed a specific pattern laid out by his service , particularly after he has been selected for flag officer . Moreover , the only constituency he has had to satisfy in his entire career is the selection board composed of members of his own service . Let us now turn to an analysis of how these individuals who have been pushed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three we will examine the performance of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the annual budgetary wars and in chapter four their performance during the wars in Vietnam and Korea .  | Military or defense policy making is essentially a political process . That military policy is not , as some might imagine , the result of deductions from national policy or foreign policy or national security policy , but rather the product of a competition among individuals and groups , a product of the normal political processes by which American domestic policy is produced , has been shown by the work of the Institute of War and Peace Studies . Aaron Wildaysky has convincingly demonstrated that even in the area of national defense , policy making and politics are synonymous . The making of military policy may be divided into four phases : planning for the use of force ; budgeting , or the request and approval of funds to procure material to implement the plans : procurement ; and operations . While each phase is important and all the phases are to some extent interdependent , the second phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not requested and/or granted , the proper mix of men and material can not be procured and the plans can not be implemented .  | Scholars , statesmen , and military leaders have been unanimous in pointing out the importance of the defense budget for military policy . The first Secretary of Defense , James Forrestal , called the budget the key to a sound defense policy . Robert McNamara referred to the budget as a quantitative expression of operating plans . General Omar Bradley , the first chairman of the JCS , stated that in the final analysis the budget controls military policy . Senator Richard Russell referred to the defense budget as the " moment of truth " when it is decided what emphasis will be placed on each of the several kinds of forces that constitute the military power of the United States . Arthur Smithies , well known economist , pointed out that defense policy does not become crystallized until budgetary decisions are taken , and that although strategy may be determined outside the budgetary process , the complexion of defense policy changes radically depending upon whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year is spent for defense . Political scientist Bernard Gordon summed up the importance of the defense budget most succinctly when he said , " To a degree not paralleled in any other field , in defense , dollars are policy . " Because of the political nature of military policy making and the importance of the budgetary process to military policy , none of the functions performed by the JCS is more important than the part it plays in the budgetary process . If the principal spokesmen for the military point of view within the American government do not play their proper role in the budgetary process , the results may be catastrophic for the American political system . The defense budget process is the entire chain of events that decides how much money will be allotted to defense and to what functions it will be allocated . There are two clearly defined phases within this process : executive preparation and submission of the defense budget to the Congress , and legislative authorization and appropriation of funds . As principal military advisors to both the executive and legislative branches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phases .  | Each post ? World War II President has developed his own mode of formulating the annual federal budget , and within the Department of Defense each Secretary of Defense has developed a particular style of producing the defense budget . Moreover , each administration has had a particular expectation about the proper role that the JCS ought to play in both the legislative and the executive phases of the defense budget process . This chapter will analyze the JCS within the context of the expectations of each administration . The JCS was created in time to be involved with the last four defense budgets produced by the Truman administration , from fiscal year 1950 to fiscal year 1953 . During these four budget evolutions , the JCS worked with no less than four Secretaries of Defense : James Forrestal , Louis Johnson , George Marshall , and Robert Lovett . Moreover , these budgets were produced in two entirely different environments . The 1950 and 1951 budgets were produced in an environment characterized by a severe decline in military preparedness and a deterioration in the relationships between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services . From a World War II high of $81.5 billion in 1945 , defense spending had dropped to about $10 billion by fiscal year 1949 . World War II cooperation between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. had degenerated into a cold war between the superpowers after the fall of Czechoslovakia in 1948 . Interservice cooperation during World War II had floundered in the postwar period upon the rocks of unification and differing views over the course of future conflicts . On the other hand , the last two budgets of the Truman administration were produced during the Korean War . The North Korean attack , which occurred about one week after the approval of a very austere 1951 budget , reversed the decline in defense  | spending , hardened the nation 's view toward the U.S.S.R. and all other Communist nations , and brought about a submergence of service rivalries . Because of the newness of the Department of Defense , the frequent change of secretaries , and the volatility of the international environment , no clear pattern of budget making emerged in the Truman administration . Therefore , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each secretary individually . Secretaries of Defense James Forrestal and Louis Johnson split the thirty-six months between the creation of the Department of Defense and the outbreak of the Korean War almost evenly . Forrestal served ten days more than eighteen months and Johnson nine days less . Although each worked within the same environment , their modi operandi and relationships with the JCS were quite different . James Forrestal worked with five military chiefs on two budgetary evolutions , a supplement to the 1949 budget and the 1950 budget . In each of these evolutions , the Joint Chiefs played similar roles . The Secretary of Defense received definitive ceilings from the Bureau of the Budget . He communicated these ceilings to the Joint Chiefs and asked them to produce a budget within these ceilings . The chiefs submitted budgets to him that were well in excess of the ceiling because they could not agree on where to reduce the individual service budgets . Each chief was willing to cut the total package if the majority of the cuts came from the other services . Their budget submissions to Forrestal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1949 , the chiefs asked for a $9 billion supplement and in 1950 they requested a total budget of $29.4 billion . The ceilings for these budgets were $3 billion and $15 billion , respectively. ?  | Forrestal sought assistance from two outside sources to bridge the gap , but neither helped . He created a board of non-JCS officers to reduce the budget , but it made only a small reduction . He then asked the Secretary of State to provide guidance to the Joint Chiefs to enable them to adjust the world situation to administration ceilings , but Secretary Marshall refused . Forrestal succeeded in bridging the gap through personal diplomacy . He summoned the chiefs to his office and told them that they could not have satisfactory and usable military power under the budgetary limitations , but that if they would produce a budget in the vicinity of the President 's ceilings , he would make further attempts to get the President to raise the limitations somewhat . For him to present the chiefs ' original estimates to the administration would strain both his and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceilings , he could tell the President they were not taking his decision lightly . The chiefs cooperated , but the White House did not . In fiscal year 1949 the chiefs and Forrestal agreed on a $3.48 billion supplement and in fiscal year 1950 they settled on $16.9 billion . Forrestal made impassioned pleas to the White House , but Truman refused to raise the ceilings on either occasion . The secretary also arranged for the Joint Chiefs to plead their case directly with the chief executive , but the result was still the same . Although there was no prior experience concerning the role that the JCS would play in the executive phase of the budget process , and the 1947 legislation was vague on the subject , Forrestal 's perception of the appropriate role for the chiefs was quite clear . He expected them to advise him on the division of funds within the limitations of the President 's ceilings and thus share responsibility with him for the division . ' ' The JCS was primarily service oriented . Each chief viewed his primary responsibility as protecting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending was limited , but felt that he could not take responsibility for any reductions that might involve his service . If cuts had to be made , each chief favored letting the other services bear the  | brunt , or forcing the Secretary of Defense or the President to make the reductions . Both President Truman and Secretary Forrestal made it clear to the JCS what role they expected the chiefs to play before the Congress . In May 1948 , when Truman made his decisions on the ceilings for the 1949 supplement and the 1950 defense budget , he informed the Joint Chiefs that he expected them to support the ceilings publicly and privately . Forrestal reinforced the President 's demands by sending a memorandum to the chiefs directing them to keep their differences within the family . The secretary added that if any chief felt he could not do so when testifying before the Congress , he ought to resign . Despite these directives , the chiefs were quite outspoken before the Congress during Forrestal 's tenure . Air Force Chiefs of Staff Spaatz and Vandenberg argued against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide funds for fifteen additional air groups for the Air Force . Army Chief of Staff Bradley urged Congress to transfer the funds Forrestal had provided for naval aviation to the Air Force . CNO Denfeld complained that the administration placed too much emphasis on the Air Force 's strategic mission The chiefs ' testimony to the Congress was supported by the service secretaries . Air Force Secretary Stuart Symington was particularly outspoken in his criticism of the policies of Forrestal . Louis Johnson assumed the helm at the Pentagon while Congress was hearing testimony on the budget for fiscal year 1950 and the Joint Chiefs were working on a statement of forces and major national requirements that would provide a foundation for a 1951 budget of less than $15 billion . Johnson did not wait long to make his impact felt on either budget . Within a few weeks of his appointment he boasted to the Senate Subcommittee on Military Appropriations that he could save a billion dollars in the Department of Defense by cutting out waste , duplications , and unnecessary civilian employment . Obviously impressed , the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' On April 23 , 1949 , within a month after succeeding Forrestal and less than a week after the Navy had completed well publicized keel-laying ceremonies , Johnson cancelled construction of the $500 million , 65,000-ton , flush deck supercarrier , the United States . This was done despite the fact that the Navy already had $364 million invested in it and Congress had appropriated funds for the ship for two consecutive fiscal years . In June , the budget director informed the secretary that the budgetary ceiling for 1951 would be 1.5 million less than for 1950 , or $13.5 billion . Without asking the services for the implications of the budget cut on their programs , Johnson then ordered a reduction in 1950 expenditures of approximately $1 billion and directed the JCS to agree on a budget for 1951 below $13.5 billion or face the prospect of an across-the-board reduction by him . On two occasions during the summer of 1949 , President Truman met with Johnson and the chiefs to discuss the adequacy of the ceiling . On both occasions the secretary and the chiefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The service budgets which the chiefs submitted to Johnson amounted to $13.31 billion . Johnson cut about $120 million of " fat " from the budget and sent it to the White House . The Bureau of the Budget reduced this figure by another $1 billion before finalizing it . The Joint Chiefs accepted both reductions without complaint and then proceeded to defend the $12.2 billion budget vigorously before a stunned Congress which wondered how military experts could support a 20 percent decline in defense spending while the international situation was rapidly worsening . There is little doubt about the role that Johnson perceived for himself . His primary job was to bring about economy in the Pentagon . Johnson saw himself as the President 's representative to the Department of Defense enforcing the administration 's will on an avaricious military . Johnson would not think of attempting to get the White House to raise the budget ceilings , but he took every opportunity to reduce spending levels in the Pentagon ; for example ,  | he seized upon a technicality to split the JCS and cancel the supercarrier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed from the conception of his own job . He expected the chiefs to divide the funds voluntarily within the ceilings imposed from above . If the chiefs could not get together voluntarily , Johnson felt that that was their problem . He would capitalize on their splits to reduce expenditures , or he would simply order across-theboard cuts . Johnson 's actions put the fear of God into the Joint Chiefs and made them real team players . They refused to challenge the budgetary ceilings in two meetings with Truman and they supported the budget before Congress . Army Chief Collins actually tried to demonstrate to Congress that the Army contributed more to the nation 's security with less men . Chairman Bradley told Congress that the military would be doing a disservice to the country if they recommended higher defense budgets . However , CNO Louis Denfeld proved to be the ultimate team player . When Johnson canceled the supercarrier , Secretary of the Navy Sullivan resigned in protest and most of the Navy 's senior officer corps were outraged . Denfeld not only accepted the Secretary of Defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . Many senior officers refused to accept Denfeld 's advice and repudiated his leadership . They rallied around vice-CNO Admiral Radford , and retired naval heroes such as Halsey and Nimitz , and publicly attacked the policy of relying solely on the Air Force 's B-36 bomber for our strategic capability and thereby denying a role for carrier aviation in the strategic arena . In press conferences , radio appearances , magazine articles , and with leaked documents , naval officers called the B-36 a " billion dollar blunder , " claimed that Navy jets could easily shoot it down , and accused senior defense officials of personal corruption in the B-36 production process . The publicity generated by these wild charges led to demands for a congressional inquiry into the issue . Denfeld attempted to curtail the inquiry but was not successful . The House Armed Services Committee held lengthy  | hearings , and the Navy case was argued primarily by Admiral Arthur Radford and by then Captain Arleigh Burke , head of the organizational policy and research division . Radford presented the arguments against the B-36 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Congress did not attempt to change Johnson 's decision . But the episode , which became known as the " revolt of the admirals , " cost " team player " Denfeld his job . By early September , 1950 , the United States was very close to being driven off the Korean peninsula by a small Asian nation , and the public , demanding to know how this could happen to a superpower , was looking for scapegoats . Since the President and the Joint Chiefs of Staff could hardly be removed in the midst of a war , Louis Johnson , the apostle of economy , was fired and the organizer of victory in World War II , George Marshall , was named to succeed him . Marshall presided over the Pentagon for only one year . During this time , Marshall and the Joint Chiefs worked on the problem of mobilizing the United States for war . They produced a defense budget for fiscal year 1952 that increased defense spending by 458 percent over fiscal year 1951 levels and raised the level of manpower in the Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While Marshall was Secretary of Defense , there were no real budgetary constraints , nor were there any complaints to the Congress . The only real constraints on defense spending were the needs of the troops in the field on the Korean peninsula and the limitations on the speed with which weapons and munitions could be produced and force levels raised . Robert Lovett succeeded Marshall in September 1951 and worked with the chiefs on the last budget of the Truman administration , the fiscal year 1953 budget . The starting point for this  | budget was a force level estimate made by the JCS . These estimates were approved by the National Security Council one month after Lovett took office . However , when these estimates were costed out , they came to $71 billion and Secretary Lovett directed the JCS to prepare alternative force levels that could be accommodated within a ceiling of $45 billion . After analyzing both budgets , Lovett and the Joint Chiefs agreed to a compromise budget of $55 billion . This was the same figure that Marshall and the JCS had arrived at in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the President reduced this compromise figure by $3 billion , both the secretary and the JCS protested strenuously . Despite their arguments , the President held firm and presented a $52 billion defense budget to Congress . The bulk of the testimony of the secretary and the JCS before Congress on the 1953 budget was devoted to supporting the budget and defending the assumptions of the administration 's limited war policy . Despite JCS pleas , the Congress , which was becoming frustrated by the apparent indecisiveness of the war in Korea and which was gearing up for the 1952 election campaign , reduced the budget by almost 10 percent . Moreover , many Republicans and conservative Democrats complained that the Joint Chiefs had become too closely identified with the partisan policies of the Truman administration and demanded that President Eisenhower replace them en masse . As Senator Robert Taft put it , " I have come to the point where I do not accept them as experts . " 22 Ironically , after Forrestal 's resignation , Truman 's chiefs had come to play the part in the budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reward they would leave office soon after he did . A great many changes took place at home and abroad during the Eisenhower years . For the purpose of strengthening the secre- tary vis-a-vis the JCS , the Department of Defense was reorganized in 1953 and in 1958 . The Korean War ended and a " new look " at military strategy produced a policy of massive retaliation . The " Great Equation " replaced Truman 's budgetary ceilings . Joseph Stalin died and the cold war was succeeded by peaceful coexistence . The Soviet Union developed an H-bomb well ahead of the predicted date and also drew first blood in the space race . Dwight Eisenhower appointed three men as his Secretary of Defense . His first appointee , Charles Wilson , held office for nearly five years . Wilson 's successor , Neil McElroy , served two years , and the last appointee , Thomas Gates , only one . During the first year of the Republican administration , Eisenhower and Wilson developed an orderly defense budget process which remained stable for the entire eight years . The production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took an entire calendar year . The process was initiated about eighteen months before the fiscal year in which the budget was to be effective and twelve months before the budget was to be submitted to the Congress . For example , work on the budget for fiscal year 1957 , which was to be submitted to Congress in January 1956 and which would become effective on July 1 , 1956 , began in January 1955 and lasted until December of that year . The process was inaugurated in January when the National Security Council produced the Basic National Security Policy ( BNSP ) . This document was intended to be a comprehensive statement of American strategic policy and had as one of its main purposes providing guidance for the Joint Chiefs in planning for force and weapon levels . Although the Security Council devoted a great deal of time and energy to the drafting of the BNSP , the document was useless for budgeting purposes . Rather than resolving the sharp differences of opinion over what the strategic policy of the United States should be , the council glossed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It meant all things  | to all men and settled nothing . For example , the 1958 edition stated that the United States would depend upon the weapons of mass retaliation , but at the same time maintain flexible forces capable of coping with a lesser situation . After completion , the Basic National Security Policy was sent to the JCS to serve as a guide for their Joint Strategic Operations Plan ( JSOP ) . The JSOP is a document of many volumes that prescribes the forces that the Joint Chiefs believe are required to carry out military strategy and national objectives . Because the Basic Security Policy could be interpreted in so many ways , each service chief stressed that portion of the policy that enhanced the primary mission of his service . Consequently , the JSOP was really three separate plans added together and called a joint plan . Secretary of Defense Wilson tried on several occasions to get the JCS to produce a joint plan , but to no avail . Consequently , he was forced to rely on Admiral Radford , the chairman of the JCS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Secretary of Defense ) for most of the force level planning . On one occasion , he even produced his own long-range plan for force levels . The completed Joint Strategic Operations Plan was sent to the services in late June . It was intended to serve as a guide or framework for the individual military departments in the production of their separate budgets . While the Joint Chiefs were completing work on the Operations Plan , the National Security Council was deciding upon a ceiling for defense expenditures for the next fiscal year . The ceiling was obtained by estimating total income , subtracting the projected expenditures of all other government agencies , and then allocating the remainder to defense . The object was a balanced budget in every fiscal year , and not even such crises as Sputnik or Suez could alter that objective . The remainder for defense usually came to between 9 and 10 percent of the gross national product . The defense ceiling was transmitted to the service chiefs by the chairman in midsummer . The individual service budgets were submitted to the JCS in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the budgets for conformity with the Basic National Security Policy and the Joint Strategic Operations Plan . The defense secretary expected the chiefs to produce a total defense budget which conformed as closely as possible to the plans but did not exceed the ceiling . However , the service budgets exceeded the ceiling by an average of 15 percent . Not once did these JCS-approved budgets come reasonably close to the ceiling . On three occasions , the budget requests exceeded the ceiling by more than 20 percent . The JCS refused to trim the budgets . Because of the vagueness of the Basic Security Policy and the ambivalence of the Joint Operations Plan , the chiefs could and did justify every item in the service budgets and refused to make reductions on the grounds of national security . Moreover , there was still a great deal of bitterness among the services and any attempt by a service chief to acquiesce in cuts for his service would be looked upon as near treason by his subordinates . Wilson and McElroy tried a variety of approaches to induce the JCS to scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to subtle hints , but always had the same lack of results . In Eisenhower 's first year in office , 1953 , Wilson twice directed the Joint Chiefs to indicate where reductions could be made in the services ' $37.82 billion request to bring it under $35 billion . The JCS refused to follow either directive on the ground that any reduction would increase the danger to national security . The following year Wilson directed Chairman Arthur Radford to persuade the chiefs to make the desired reductions . Radford was unable to get the chiefs to agree on a lower level of expenditures and was forced to make recommendations for reductions himself . Four years later , when he was faced with a JCS-approved budget of $44.67 billion and an administration ceiling of $38 billion , Secretary Neil McElroy tried a more subtle approach than had his predecessors . He asked the chiefs how they would divide $38 billion , without in any way implying that this was the  | amount they approved . The chiefs discussed this hypothetical question briefly and then informed McElroy that they unanimously agreed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt he needed the additional $4 billion for his own service and could not voluntarily give it away to another military department . In essence , they were telling the Secretary that they needed the entire $45 billion . In 1959 , Eisenhower intervened personally by inviting the chiefs to a stag dinner at the White House . During the dinner , the former general gave the chiefs a pep talk on the great need for more cooperation on their part with the secretary in connection with the budget . Only Chairman Twining was receptive . The chiefs refused to change their behavior . So little did the Joint Chiefs have to do with the final defense budget that they never even considered such important questions as the size of the Army , the number of aircraft carriers , or the amount of deterrent forces . The job of making such important decisions , and therefore where to make the major reductions , was left to the office of the Secretary of Defense and to the President . Wilson and McElroy often ordered across-the-board reductions . The comptroller for the Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed decisions . Eisenhower made about fifteen major budgetary decisions annually and was the chief architect of the plan for reducing the Army 's ground forces . The Eisenhower administration expected the Joint Chiefs to cooperate fully with the defense office and to act with that office as a single staff for the Secretary of Defense . The defense secretaries did not want purely military advice from the JCS . They expected the chiefs to broaden their outlooks to include a wide range of domestic and international economic and political factors . The majority of the chiefs felt that their primary duties were to provide military advice and to protect the vested interests of their services . The chiefs felt that neither their military professionalism nor their service interests could be well protected by taking into account political and economic criteria . They resisted all  | attempts to get them to color their advice . Consequently , they had neither a harmonious relationship with the administration nor a large impact in the budget process . Dwight Eisenhower , the career soldier , made it perfectly clear to every member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support his yearly defense budget before the Congress . He made it obvious that he would consider anything less than enthusiastic support for his budgets as an act of disloyalty to the Commander in Chief . So confident was Eisenhower that the JCS would obey this direct order that , without consulting the chiefs , he announced to the Congress upon submitting his first defense budget that it had the unanimous approval of the JCS . For the first two years of his administration , Eisenhower 's order was followed . In 1953 and 1954 Ridgway came very close to contesting Eisenhower 's " massive retaliation " strategy before Congress but always refrained from open criticism and saved his true feelings until after his retirement in 1955 . However , from 1955 on , all of the chiefs , except the chairman , took great exception to Eisenhower 's budgets . Maxwell Taylor and Arleigh Burke were particularly outspoken in their criticism of the " New Look , " the sloppy directives , and the stringent budget ceilings . Taylor told the Congress that the policies embodied by the Eisenhower defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American atomic power had not been enough to keep the peace , as evidenced by the many forms of limited war which had occurred since 1945 . Therefore , Taylor argued , the United States was much more likely to become involved in a conventional rather than a nuclear war . Accordingly Taylor urged the lawmakers to take another look at the New Look and to adopt a policy of measured rather than massive retaliation , a policy of flexible response . The Army Chief of Staff stated that the Eisenhower reduction of the Army to 860,000 men had left it at least 500,000 men below minimum acceptable strength and that the budget ceilings placed upon his  | service had resulted in his troops possessing outmoded combat equipment and too few conventional weapons . Taylor pointed out to the Congress that Soviet armies were well equipped with third generation hardware , while 70 percent of U.S. material was of World War II vintage or older . Specifically Taylor urged the legislative branch to provide additional funds to step up development of antiaircraft and antimissile missiles , to increase our air and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Burke told the Congress that the Navy needed more funds for new ship construction , for overhauling its existing ships , and for strengthening its antisubmarine defenses against the Soviet Union 's 500-submarine force . The CNO argued that both the Navy and the Marines needed more men to carry out their missions . A 600,000-man Navy and 170,000 Marines were 20 percent below minimums . Specifically he urged the legislators to speed up the Polaris program and to build an additional nuclear powered aircraft carrier , five more guided missile destroyers , and four additional nuclear attack submarines . Even the Air Force chiefs criticized the Eisenhower budgets . Although their service was the main beneficiary of the Eisenhower strategy , receiving 46 percent of the total defense budget from 1952 to 1960 , Generals Twining and White asked Congress for more fighter air wings and more rapid production of B-52 bombers and ballistic missiles . Their complaints about these shortcomings in massive retaliation led to special hearings by Congress on the condition of American air power . In fiscal year 1960 , the service chiefs actually put their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Senator Lyndon Johnson 's Senate Preparedness Subcommittee . The chiefs ' conduct before the Congress so incensed Eisenhower that he publicly accused the JCS of legalized insubordination . The President even attempted to amend the National Security Act to take away the chiefs ' prerogative of informing Congress about their disagreements with the administration 's de- fense policy . However , since he never brought any sanctions against the offending chiefs , as did his predecessor and his successor , Eisenhower was not able to get the chiefs to be team players . Ironically , during the last year that Eisenhower was in office , the Joint Chiefs began to move in the direction of being team players . However , it was not the result of any directive from the Commander in Chief , but of the style of Eisenhower 's lame duck defense secretary , Thomas Gates . Taking office in December 1959 , after having served as Secretary of the Navy and deputy secretary of defense , Gates established an excellent relationship with the chiefs . Rather than waiting for JCS papers to come up to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chairman , Gates himself met with the entire JCS several times a week . During these meetings he saw to it that the chiefs had their innings and he never allowed them to lose face with their own service people . Gates did not ask the chiefs to compromise their views and encouraged them to appeal his decisions to higher authority . These methods created great loyalty to him and put a stop to the end runs to Congress and the press leaks that had bedeviled his predecessors . A good example of the new attitude of the JCS was the way in which the Chief of Naval Operations reacted to the dispute over strategic targeting . With the development of Polaris submarines , the Navy had finally gained its long-sought goal of a permanent place in the strategic arena . In early 1960 , Navy leaders asked the defense secretary to allow them to select their own targets for the submarine-launched ballistic missiles . After a month-long personal study of the situation , Gates turned down the Navy 's request . He concluded that the targets selected for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Strategic Air Command and he set up a unified strategic planning group under the control of the Air Force general who headed SAC . Gates ' decision met with vehement opposition from CNO Arleigh Burke and the other members of the naval hierarchy . The Naval Officers Corps  | feared that placing Polaris under the control of an Air Force general would result in the Navy 's losing control of its new weapon . The controversy appeared to have all of the elements of the " revolt of the admirals " which had occurred a decade earlier . However , because of Gates ' actions , there was not even a minor rebellion . The secretary believed that if there were strong disagreement on military policy questions , a chief should present his case to the President . Therefore , he encouraged Burke to appeal his decision directly to Eisenhower . The CNO met with the President and for five hours argued vehemently against Gates ' decision . Eisenhower listened sympathetically but ruled against the Navy . Burke , upset at the decision , but grateful to the secretary for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not revive the Organizational and Policy Research Division . Instead , he sent a message to the entire fleet . In the message Burke not only announced that he supported Gates ' decision , but also ordered his subordinates to send the Navy 's best people to fill the billets on the Joint Strategic Target Planning Group . " Despite the publicity generated by the public statements and congressional testimony of the Joint Chiefs , there is no evidence that they affected the level of defense expenditures . Congress listened sympathetically but refused to take responsibility for significantly increasing the defense budget . And the President , who was well aware of the dangers of the military-industrial complex , invariably impounded any excess funds appropriated by the Congress . In Eisenhower 's eight years in office , Congress added $2.0 billion and cut $3.8 billion for a net change of $1.8 billion , or one-half of one percent . Before assuming the Presidency , John Kennedy appointed a committee , headed by Senator Symington , the first Secretary of  | the Air Force , to study Department of Defense organization for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of study , the Symington Committee proposed a radical reorganization of the department . But , when Robert McNamara accepted Kennedy 's offer to become the eighth Secretary of Defense , he persuaded the young President-elect to delay proposing the reorganization until he ( McNamara ) could assess the situation personally . But Kennedy did give McNamara two directives : first , develop the military structure required for a firm foundation for our foreign policy without regard to budget ceilings ; second , operate this force at the lowest possible cost . Armed only with those two directives , and without benefit of any new legislation , McNamara made so many changes , formal and informal , organizational and procedural , during his seven years in the Pentagon that he brought about not just a reorganization but a revolution in the Department of Defense . Nowhere was this revolution more acutely felt than in the budget process , where the eighth Secretary of Defense introduced the **29;311;TOOLONG system ( PPBS ) and cost effectiveness ( systems analysis ) . The PPBS divided the budgetary process into three clearly defined cycles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fiscal year 1966 budget , which was to become effective in July 1965 and was to be submitted to the Congress in January 1965 , got under way in July 1963 . Cost effectiveness , or systems analysis , is a technique that looks at alternate ways of performing a job and seeks , by estimating in quantitative terms where possible , to identify the most effective alternative . The foundation for the **30;342;TOOLONG system in the defense department from 1961 through 1968 was the Five-Year Defense Plan ( FYDP ) . This document was the master plan for the budget process and contained the programs approved by the defense office with their estimated costs projected for five years . The initial Five-Year Plan was produced in 1961 and projected  | programs and costs through 1965 . Each year the plan was updated by decisions made during the budget process . The planning cycle was the first and longest . It began in July and lasted until February and was composed of three steps . The first step involved production of Volume I of the Joint Strategic Operations Plan by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military threat facing the United States and of our national commitments projected for five years . For about five years , the JCS devoted a great deal of time and energy to producing this part of the JSOP . Since there was no Basic National Security Policy , the chiefs hoped that their estimates would furnish the basis for all subsequent budgetary decisions . They hoped to make the Joint Plan a substitute for the Basic Policy . However , by 1965 the JCS realized that the JSOP had little impact on subsequent budget decisions . In fact , they wondered if anyone even read it . Thus they began to spend less and less time on it and by 1967 had turned the job over to their subordinates . While the JCS was working on the first part of the Joint Strategic Operations Plan , McNamara often assigned special projects to the chiefs . These projects consisted of a set of specific questions , had very short deadlines , and had great potential implications for the budget . For example , in March 1961 , McNamara asked the chiefs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next decade and he set a deadline of six weeks for the study . The Joint Chiefs complained a great deal about these short deadlines , but always completed the studies on time . The Office of the Secretary of Defense usually found the studies lacking in many respects . From 1961 through 1965 , the defense office usually was content with pointing out the inconsistencies in these studies . But from 1965 onward , when the position of Assistant Secretary of Defense , Systems Analysis ( SA ) , was established within the defense office , the Office of Systems Analysis began to make recommendations of its own and these were usually accepted by the defense secretary .  | The second step of the planning cycle consisted of the submission of force level recommendations by the services and unified commands to the JCS . These recommendations were based upon the threat and commitments outlined in Volume I of the Joint Strategic Operations Plan . The third and final step of the planning cycle involved the completion of two major documents . The JCS completed Volume II of the JSOP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet our national needs . Although the force levels were supposed to be based on the advice both of the services and of the unified commanders , the JCS rarely paid attention to the latter 's ideas , and Volume II was based primarily upon service inputs . The Joint Chiefs ignored the unified commanders ' requests because they were unrealistic and because the chiefs were wary of losing any power to these men , who were theoretically their equals . While the JCS was completing the Joint Strategic Operations Plan , the Office of the Secretary of Defense produced a major program memorandum ( MPM ) for each of the ten mission areas and support activities of the defense budget . These memoranda summarized the defense office position on the major force levels , the rationale for choices among alternatives , and the recommended force levels and funding . Although the memoranda were programming documents based upon the planning in the JSOP , their authors in fact ignored the JSOP and the major programming memoranda became both planning and programming documents , the central action instruments of the defense budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's receipt of the Joint Strategic Operations Plan and the major programming memoranda . This cycle lasted about six months ( through the end of August ) . McNamara normally reviewed these documents for about thirty days and then provided guidance to the services for preparing program change requests ( PCR ) , suggested modifications to the Five-Year Defense Plan . The primary factor shaping this guidance was the programming memo- randa . The services normally submitted about three hundred program change requests annually to the Office of Systems Analysis , whose decisions were nearly always negative . The rejection of the change requests was attributable to three factors : the services used poor analytical techniques , their requests did not convey any sense of priority in relation to the base program , and the requested changes involved greater costs . Theoretically all program decisions should have been made before budgeting began , but this was not the case . Many of the program decisions were negotiated during and after the budgetary cycle . A defense office official reported that in fiscal years 1968 and 1969 , 90 percent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28 , that is , after the conclusion of the budgetary cycle . While Systems Analysis was reviewing the program change requests , the JCS was reviewing the major programming memoranda . The chiefs ' comments on the memoranda were sent to the defense secretary in July . For the remainder of the summer , McNamara and the JCS met about fifteen times to discuss the chiefs ' adverse comments . From 1961 through 1965 , the JCS was never united on the major issues raised in the programming memoranda . The Navy objected to the B-70 ; the Army opposed a fifteen-carrier fleet ; and the Air Force was less than enthusiastic about the antiballistic missile . In their meetings , McNamara was able to capitalize on these differences and skillfully played one service off against another . However , from 1966 onward , the JCS worked out their differences prior to meeting with the defense secretary and presented a united front to him . For example , the Air Force wanted thirty-five wings of tactical aircraft and the Navy wanted seventeen attack carriers . Prior to meeting McNamara , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiations were conducted on the ABM . The chiefs realized early that McNamara was dividing and conquering but were not able to work out their differences until Taylor stepped down as chairman and Lemay was pushed out as Air  | Force Chief of Staff . Taylor was regarded as an administration man and Lemay was an uncompromising crusader for air power . General Wheeler , Taylor 's successor as chairman , refused to bring split opinions to McNamara . He would tell the other chiefs that he would wait until they came to some agreement before adjourning their meetings . This united front eventually paid dividends for the Joint Chiefs . When they were divided McNamara could carry the day by pointing out the division to the President and Congress . But even McNamara was hesitant about overruling a united or common professional military opinion . Consequently , such items as a nuclear carrier and the ABM , which the secretary opposed for about five years , were eventually approved . The budgetary cycle officially began in September when the services were asked to prepare their budgets in the traditional categories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program packages , for submission to the Office of the Secretary of Defense by October 1 . In issuing his call for budget submissions , McNamara emphatically pointed out , year after year , that the services were not to feel bound by any budgetary ceiling , real or imagined . They were to be guided only by decisions made in regard to the major programming memoranda and the program change requests . The secretary repeatedly stated that this country could afford whatever was necessary for defense . Theoretically , the budgetary cycle was to consist only of costing out approved programs . Despite McNamara 's rhetoric , the JCS had a very good idea of what the total and individual service budgets would be . Sometimes the comptroller let the service chiefs know as early as July . On most occasions , it was a simple matter of arithmetic . It was more than a mere coincidence that what this country could afford for defense from fiscal year 1963 through fiscal year 1966 , ( before the Vietnam buildup ) came within 1 percent of $46 billion each year and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the budget remained the same as under Eisenhower , a fairly constant 27 , 32 , and 41 percent respectively . A service chief who served under  | Eisenhower and McNamara said that in regard to budget ceilings there was no real difference between either administration . Another chief remarked , " Weapon systems became more and more difficult to justify as we approached our portion of $46 billion . " Any lingering doubts about a budget ceiling in the Department of Defense were shattered during the Vietnam buildup when McNamara directed the services to delete programs that were not urgent , to assume for budgetary purposes that the war would be over by the end of the fiscal year and that during the year there would he no increase in the level of our commitment to Vietnam , and to stretch out maintenance and repair cycles by about 50 percent . These directives made it necessary to have four consecutive supplemental budgets from 1966 through 1969 , caused the Joint Chiefs to contemplate resigning en masse , destroyed McNamara 's credibility with Johnson , and eventually contributed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service budget requests exceeded by about 10 percent the amount eventually approved . However , from 1966 through 1968 , as McNamara 's standing within the administration waned , the gap between the amount requested and the amount granted widened enormously . According to defense department figures , the requests for fiscal year 1967 exceeded by 19 percent the amount granted , and the difference climbed to 28 percent in 1968 and to over 30 percent in 1969 . From October through December , the comptroller 's office reviewed these budgets . In its review , the office normally initiated some six hundred subject issues , that is , areas of potential savings . Although these issues were theoretically technical ( for example , the cost of a submarine or the cost of equipping an infantry battalion ) , in fact the issues reflected intuitive feelings on the part of the personnel in the comptroller 's office about where they felt cuts ought to be made . McNamara reviewed the budgets personally and , with the subject issues as a guide , made about seven hundred budgetary decisions annually . Often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the color of belt buckles . During his review , McNamara consulted with the JCS about twenty times . These consultations took place on the secretary 's terms . McNamara never allowed the chiefs to review the budget as a whole but only asked them to comment on items individually . He was not interested in whether the chiefs preferred x or y , only their opinion of x . In deliberating about x , the chiefs never knew if he would ask about y . The executive phase of the budgetary cycle concluded in late December when the President met with the defense secretary and the Joint Chiefs for about four hours . Despite vigorous opposition on the part of many members of the JCS during their " days in court , " the President invariably sided with McNamara . Some of the issues raised in these meetings included the B-70 , the number of Polaris submarines , and pilot shortages . McNamara expected the Joint Chiefs of Staff to be more than military advisors . He wanted them to incorporate economic criteria into their traditional military requirement studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes . The defense secretary viewed the JCS as one of the many resources available to him to be used on his terms ; the chiefs were no more or no less important than any of his other advisors . The ability of the chiefs to influence policy was dependent upon the quality of their advice , not upon their position as the principal military advisors to the Secretary of Defense . McNamara expected the JCS to be satisfied with the increased level of defense spending and to accept his innovations as " more rational " than previous methods . Once he had reached a decision , the secretary expected the chiefs to support it , even if they opposed the rationale for the decision . McNamara 's methods , particularly in the executive phase of the budget process , infuriated not only the JCS but nearly the entire officers corps as well . In the eyes of most of the professional military men , the **30;374;TOOLONG system and systems analysis were essentially devices for substituting social science  | techniques for military experience and transferring the making of strategy from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Force Chief of Staff from 1957 to 1961 , clearly reflected the deep resentment of the military when he stated that he was profoundly apprehensive of these so-called professional defense intellectuals . White did not believe that these arrogant young men had sufficient worldliness or motivation to stand up to the enemy . His successor as Air Force Chief of Staff , Curtis Lemay , echoed these sentiments when he complained that the military profession had been overrun by civilian pundits who set themselves up as popular oracles of military strategy . In Lemay 's view , these civilian experts , without military experience , propose military strategies based upon hopes and fears rather than seasoned judgments , and these unprofessional strategists go unchallenged only because McNamara had effectively prohibited the professional active duty officers from entering the debate . Admiral Hyman Rickover , the father of the Navy 's nuclear power program , compared McNamara and his civilian experts to spiritualists who tried to play God while neglecting the responsibility of being human . Testifying before Congress in May 1968 , Rickover claimed that these civilians had no scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He argued that this country was unwise to put its fate into the inexperienced hands of McNamara and his men . After being fired as CNO , George Anderson summed up the frustrations of the military men who had to work with the Secretary of Defense and his civilian associates . In a speech to the National Press Club in September 1963 , Anderson stated that military men feel emotionally aroused when the recommendations of the uniformed chiefs , each backed up by competent professional staffs , are altered or overruled without interim consultation , explanation , and discussion . In Anderson 's view , McNamara 's analysts were working at the wrong echelon : they were operating above the pro- fessional military level rather than in an advisory capacity . These specialists were endangering national security by injecting their judgments into fields in which they had no expert knowledge . It was not much of an exaggeration to say that military men under McNamara felt that they had been reduced to second-class citizens in the defense budget process . Their views appeared to be at the mercy of almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defense . The military was not any happier about McNamara 's legislative guidelines . The secretary was quite explicit about how the Joint Chiefs should act during their congressional testimony . In a memorandum from his office , the chiefs were directed not to reveal their differences with him unless pressed by Congress , and if they did , they were also to present the secretary 's position . To insure conformity with this directive , someone from McNamara 's office was always present when a chief was testifying . Initially McNamara had a great deal of difficulty in getting the chiefs to follow the " party line " before Congress . Lemnitzer , Lemay , and Anderson took exception to McNamara 's strategy and methods in the period from 1961 to 1963 . In order to secure compliance from the chiefs , McNamara had all three of the offenders removed from the JCS and put less well known men in their place . From 1964 through 1966 , McNamara 's band of chiefs harmonized beautifully before the Congress . Not even the barbed questions of several members of the Armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McNamara 's policies or methods . So ebullient were the chiefs in their praise of the defense budgets that on several occasions some congressmen asked them if they had lost their nerve , while others accused the chiefs of letting their services down . However , by mid-1966 it became apparent to the Joint Chiefs that McNamara 's dovishness was eroding his relationship with Johnson and consequently his power to retaliate against them . Therefore , in McNamara 's last years in office , the chiefs openly  | criticized their boss and his methods before the Congress . In the spring of 1967 , Chairman Wheeler read a prepared statement criticizing McNamara 's position on the ABM . Admiral McDonald contended that McNamara 's program deferrals were ruining his fleet , and General McConnell urged Congress to overrule the secretary 's opposition to a new manned bomber to replace the aging B-52 . Unfortunately for the JCS , the pleas fell on deaf ears . By the end of the McNamara years , a war-weary public was starting to become tired of large defense budgets and Congress was beginning to sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had observed McNamara 's revolution from his seat on the House Subcommittee on Military Appropriations , agreed with many military men that McNamara 's methods had led to overcentralization in decision making and an insufficient role for the professional soldier . Accordingly , when he became the tenth Secretary of Defense , Laird instituted certain changes in the defense budget process to redress this situation . He referred to his method as participatory management . The essence of these changes was contained in a " treaty " signed by the deputy secretary of defense , the service secretaries , and the chairman of the JCS . This treaty , " negotiated " soon after Laird assumed the helm at the Pentagon , provided that the Secretary of Defense would look to the services and the JCS in the design of forces and that the Office of Systems Analysis would limit itself to evaluation and review and not put forward independent proposals of its own . In return for this concession , the secretary expected the services to operate within rigid budget ceilings . " As a means of emphasizing the reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant secretary for Systems Analysis vacant for a year . Eventually the head  | of Systems Analysis was downgraded from an assistant secretary to a director . The defense budget was still a product of the **30;406;TOOLONG system , but , as the treaty indicated , the emphasis with the process was shifted . Moreover , during the first years of the Nixon administration , the National Security Council was revitalized and the military was provided with its clearest conception of United States policy in many years . During the first three years of the Nixon administration , about 150 national security study memoranda ( NSSM ) were produced by the National Security Council , and many of these provided guidance for the military budget planners . In the first month of the new administration , the security study memoranda concerned such budget-related topics as military posture , American military forces , and contingency planning . NSSM 3 of January 21 , 1969 , resulted in a study of the tasks which American military forces should be prepared to undertake and concluded that the United States must be prepared to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half wars ) simultaneously rather than the somewhat impractical two and a half wars of the McNamara period . As indicated in figure 3 , the planning process began eighteen months before the budget was sent to Congress and had as its foundation the Five-Year Defense Plan . The JCS inaugurated the planning cycle by producing Volume I of the Joint Strategic Operations Plan ( the strategic assessment ) and sending it to Laird . The secretary reviewed the JSOP for conformity with National Security Council doctrine and then issued a coordinated , complete , and current strategic guidance document for the entire defense community . This strategic guidance memorandum ( SGM ) was essentially the JSOP with some updating and enlargement and was issued in January ( for example , the memorandum for fiscal year 1972 was issued in January 1970 ) . In January , the secretary also issued a tentative fiscal guidance memorandum ( TFGM ) projecting dollar constraints for the next  | five years . While the elements of the Department of Defense were reviewing this memorandum , the JCS completed the force structure portion ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a purely military perspective , without regard to the fiscal constraints of the tentative fiscal guidance memorandum . The defense secretary reviewed the comments on the tentative memorandum and Volume II of the JSOP and then completed the planning cycle by issuing a fiscal guidance memorandum ( FGM ) in March . This document set definite ceilings on the total budget and on each service . During the first Nixon administration the overall ceiling ranged from $75 to $70 billion , divided almost evenly among the services . The overall ceiling for the fiscal guidance memorandum was negotiated between Laird and the Defense Program Review Committee ( DPRC ) , a subcommittee within the National Security Council system composed of the President 's assistant for national security affairs , the deputy secretary of defense , the undersecretary of state , the chairman of the JCS , the director of the Office of Management and Budget , and the chairman of the President 's Council of Economic Advisers . The task of this committee is to anticipate the political , economic , and social implications resulting from changes in defense spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created in October 1969 , and has provided inputs for all of the budgets since fiscal year 1971 . The programming cycle began in April when the JCS drew up a joint force memorandum ( JFM ) , which presented the chiefs ' recommendations on force levels and support programs that could be provided within the fiscal constraints of the fiscal guidance memorandum . The joint force document also included an assessment of the risks in these forces as measured against the strategy and objectives of the Joint Strategic Operations Plan , Volume I , and a comparison of the costs of its recommendations with the Five-Year Defense Plan . Finally , the joint force memorandum highlighted the major force issues to be resolved during the year . In May , each service submitted to the Secretary of Defense a program objective  | memorandum ( POM ) for each major mission area and support activity in the defense budget . These memoranda expressed total program requirements in terms of forces , manpower , and costs and provided a rationale for deviations from the Five-Year Plan and the joint force memorandum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program documents , but confined itself to reviewing those submitted by the JCS and the services . In July Laird completed the programming cycle by issuing program decision memoranda ( PDM ) for each budget area . These memoranda were a product of the Joint Strategic Operations Plan , the joint force memorandum , the program objective memoranda , and the analysis of these documents performed in the secretary 's office by his systems analysts . The Five-Year Defense Plan was updated each summer by these program decision memoranda . During the rest of the year , the defense secretary met with the JCS to resolve any disputes over the program decision memoranda . Laird was desirous of achieving consensus with the chiefs and these meetings developed into real negotiating and bargaining sessions and resulted in compromises between the parties . For example , the secretary allowed the Air Force to build two prototypes of the B-1 before committing the department to full production . Likewise , Laird got the Navy to drop its demand for a nuclear carrier in fiscal year 1972 by promising to support the carrier in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn down a JCS request for monetary reasons or because of a decision made by the administration , he encouraged the chiefs to take their case to other agencies within the executive branch , for example , the Office of Management and Budget , the Treasury , the Defense Program Review Committee , or even the Oval Office . The only restriction placed on this practice was that a service chief must make his case on its own merits and not at the expense of another service . Finally , if the Joint Chiefs were able to convince Laird that their position had more merit than administration policy , the secretary would join them in trying to win a reversal of the decision . For example ,  | when the JCS objected to the new military retirement plan proposed by an administration study , Laird appointed a group within the Pentagon to study the administration 's plan and stymied all action on the proposal . Likewise , in fiscal year 1972 , when the JCS convinced him that there would be too many weaknesses in the military force that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laird succeeded in convincing the President to allocate an additional $ 6 billion to defense . The budgetary cycle commenced on September 30 , when each service submitted its budget to the Secretary of Defense . The budgets were supposed to be based on the approved programs resulting from the various decision documents produced in the program cycle . In each year that Laird was in office , these budget requests were within 5 percent of the established ceilings . The estimates were reviewed during October and November by the defense office staff and representatives of the Office of Management and Budget . From fiscal year 1970 to fiscal year 1973 , these officials reduced these submissions by an average of 3.7 percent , far less than had previous administrations and even Congress . Before going to the President , the defense budget was reviewed by the Defense Program Review Committee . However , because of the time constraints , the impact of this body has been minimal . In the week or so that the committee has to review the budget , it could hardly be expected to make major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become involved earlier in the budget cycle by reviewing Laird 's strategic guidance memorandum and setting fiscal constraints on certain areas , but the secretary successfully resisted these efforts to encroach upon his perceived area of bureaucratic responsibility . By the end of Nixon 's first administration , the chairman of the Defense Program Review Committee had become so involved with other problems , such as the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and the Middle East , that the committee dropped its attempt to reshape the defense budget . Its main impact has been in the area of overall fiscal guidance .  | Nixon allowed the JCS to have their day in court usually in late December or early January . Each chief was allowed about fifteen minutes to brief the President , although sometimes a more exuberant chief , like Zumwalt , might take more time . These sessions did not result in any major changes in the budget under review , but did serve to strengthen the President 's resolve to fight for certain programs before the Congress and to lay the foundation for the upcoming budget . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is becoming increasingly disenchanted with defense programs . Congressional reductions in the first Nixon administration amounted to an average of 5.3 percent or $4 billion annually . The chiefs were so overwhelmed trying to justify their portion of the administration budget that they had no chance to ask for increments or to criticize the policies of the administration or the programs of the other services . Moreover , they realized that any attempt to do so would only weaken their own position . The Nixon chiefs were fairly successful on the hill . Although congressional reductions were large in fiscal terms , Congress did not affect any of the key JCS programs , for example , the B-1 , the Trident , the F-14 , the S-3A , and the F-15 . Laird had a very clear conception of the role that the Joint Chiefs should play in the budget process . Within broad guidelines established by his office , he expected them to take the initiative in the development of programs , subject to a final review by his office . He wanted them to work within clearly established budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him , to take responsibility for the forces developed within those ceilings . The defense secretary did not want to see an outbreak of the interservice rivalry that followed each previous war when defense budgets were reduced in real terms . The JCS apparently lived up to Laird 's expectations and their relationship was quite harmonious . Their requested budgets were always close to the established ceilings and there were no public outbreaks of interservice rivalries . For example , in the vigorous  | debate within Congress over the Trident , Admiral Zumwalt did not make his case at the expense of the Air Force 's B-1 . The CNO 's argument was based on Russian activities , not those of another service . The Laird chiefs apparently realized that they had to be " team players . " Without support in Congress or from the public , their only source of strength lay in an administration and a secretary committed to a strong national defense posture . Perhaps the best way to begin to summarize this analysis of the role of the JCS in the defense budget process would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that process . The preceeding sections indicated that , despite changes in style or emphasis from secretary to secretary , there are four steps which are common to all post ? World War II administrations : They are ( 1 ) the establishment of the overall size of the military budget ; ( 2 ) the production of strategic plans to guide the distribution of defense funds ; ( 3 ) the preparation and submission of departmental budget requests ; and ( 4 ) review and revision of these requests . The JCS has had virtually no impact upon determining the actual size of the military budget . All of the administrations have arrived at a figure for defense based upon factors quite apart from the opinions of the Joint Chiefs and often times have resisted strenuous efforts on the part of the chiefs to raise the ceilings . The first two postwar administrations relied on magic number ceilings . President Truman decided that one-third of the budget would go for defense purposes , while his Republican successor decided that no more than 10 percent of the gross national product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson had recourse to any magic numbers , but they imposed specific constraints on McNamara before he made his allegedly open-ended program decisions . This was especially evident during Vietnam , when John- son was striving for both " guns and butter " and placed unrealistic constraints upon a wartime budget . The Nixon administration 's ceilings were based on the gross national product , the anticipated reaction of Congress , and the desire to have a balanced full employment budget . For the past twenty-five years , the JCS has developed strategic plans to guide the distribution of defense funds . These master plans have been referred to as the JSOP ( Joint Strategic Operations Plan ) for most of the period . In the Truman , Eisenhower , and Nixon administrations , these plans were related to guidelines developed by the National Security Council , while , in the McNamara years , the JSOP was written without any advice from the civilian leaders . Despite the time and effort spent on the JSOP , there is no evidence that it has any real impact upon defense budgeting . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and often goes unread by the key officials . The Joint Chiefs were not the only ones developing unrealistic budget plans over the past twenty-five years . The National Security Council plans of the Truman administration , the Basic National Security Policy of the Eisenhower era , McNamara 's major program memoranda , and Laird 's strategic guidance memoranda have also been of little use in the budget process . The main beneficiaries of this gap between planning and budgeting have been the service chiefs . With no operative framework , the Joint Chiefs have been free to request nearly anything they want in the third essential step , the preparation and submission of the monetary requests . Because of the absence of any real link between the plans and the budgets , such factors as program decisions and administration priorities have not affected the things requested by the chiefs to any great degree . However , the chiefs are almost without influence in the final step of the process , the budgeting review . Ironically , during the Truman and Eisenhower administrations they could have dominated the review , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when they tried to establish priorities during  | McNamara 's reviews , the secretary refused to allow them to do so . Under Laird the reviews have not been very significant because the services requests have been very close to the ceilings . Although there have been brief periods during the Truman and Eisenhower administrations and the McNamara years when the chiefs have allowed themselves to be pressured into tacitly supporting defense policies with which they disagreed , the JCS has generally played a very active role in the legislative phase of budgetary process . The Truman administration witnessed the " revolt of the admirals " ; the Eisenhower chiefs sent a written statement to Lyndon Johnson ; Chairman Earl Wheeler read a prepared pro-ABM and anti-McNamara statement to the Congress ; and the Nixon chiefs vigorously defended many controversial weapon systems on Capitol Hill . However , the JCS has had little impact upon the Congress . Despite the publicity often generated during the legislative phase , the Congress has shown itself unwilling to make real program choices in the defense budget . Except for the Nixon administration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian superiors . Truman and Eisenhower wanted the JCS to work within and publicly support ceilings developed primarily on political and economic grounds , while McNamara demanded that the JCS use and extol a methodology , which placed very little importance on military experience , for deciding the size and distribution of the defense budget . Except on a few occasions , the JCS refused to share responsibility for the ceilings or the methodology before the Congress , the American people , or their service subordinates . In the first Nixon administration , the JCS played exactly the role that the administration had envisioned for it . David Packard , Laird 's deputy secretary of defense , called the Joint Chiefs the finest , most dedicated , most capable men he had ever known and stated that they had given Secretary Laird their complete support and cooperation . The reasons for the JCS switch in modus operandi are many , but perhaps the most important is the changed  | attitude of the American people toward defense spending . If the chiefs do not take responsibility for the administration 's budget before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a sympathetic hearing . Before 1969 , the military leaders could always find a sympathetic constituency that would support their claims against the administration , but now their only real supporters are in the administration . In evaluating the role of the JCS in the budget process , it is not sufficient to consider only whether the chiefs have fulfilled the expectations of our elected officials . There is an issue that is more important for the well-being of the American political system : did the Joint Chiefs of Staff dominate the process to such an extent that this nation spent more on defense than its elected leaders desired ? Or , were they denied sufficient input into the process with the result that our civilian leaders made their budgetary decisions without the benefit of expert military opinion ? This analysis has shown that the answer to both of these questions must be negative . The JCS had very little impact upon the size of the defense budget . The starting point for the bottom line was not JCS plans but real political and economic constraints . Moreover , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the chiefs were eventually able to make their positions known within the administration and to the Congress . Let us now see if the wartime activities of the JCS present as balanced a picture .  | Nothing brings the JCS into public view more forcefully than the outbreak of war . Yet , as was noted in the first chapter , the Joint Chiefs have very little authority in the operational realm . The chiefs do not have any forces under their control and are excluded from the chain of command . The chain presently goes from the President through the Secretary of Defense to one of the unified commanders . The chiefs are merely advisers to the President and the defense secretary in the exercise of their command authority , and there is no legal requirement for these civilian leaders to consult the Joint Chiefs or even keep them informed of their decisions on operational matters . Nevertheless , every time an armed conflict arises , the Joint Chiefs seem to be involved and are usually held responsible for the consequences of operational decisions . For example , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statement which indicated that it was their expert opinion that the beleaguered outpost at Khe Sanh could be held against North Vietnamese assaults . The President made the chiefs do this even though they were 7,000 miles from the scene and had no say in establishing the outposts or providing  | for their defense . These decisions were made by the field commander , General Westmoreland . There is no doubt that the JCS does play a role in the operational area . Every government study of the Department of Defense from the first Hoover Commission to the Fitzhugh Panel has recommended that the chiefs divorce themselves from the operational realm and operate primarily as a planning agency . Yet , none of the studies has ever addressed the related questions of how and why the JCS does become involved , what that involvement consists of , or what the impact of the JCS is on operational matters . In the twenty-five years since the creation of the Department of Defense , the cold war has turned very hot for the United States on two occasions , Korea ( 1950 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In addition to these two shooting wars , each of which involved the commitment of several hundred thousand American fighting men , the United States has been confronted with several crises which have resulted in the use of small numbers of American troops or the threat of military action : Berlin , the Congo , Laos , the Middle East , Cuba , and the Dominican Republic . A detailed analysis of JCS activities in every crisis would result in several books . This chapter will begin by summarizing the role of the chiefs in these crisis situations and then move on to a detailed discussion of the part that the JCS played in the two shooting wars in which the United States has become engaged . These two wars involved each of the postwar administrations and encompassed all of the reorganizations that affected the chiefs ' operational authority . In the crisis situations of the post ? World War II period which did not evolve into armed conflicts , the Joint Chiefs of Staff played a minor role . During some of these situations the chiefs were not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the initial decision to commit four hundred troops to the Dominican Republic in 1965 . This critical decision was taken at a White House meeting on April 28 , 1965 , at which the Secretary of De- fense , the Secretary of State , the director of Central Intelligence , the United Nations ambassador , the presidential assistant for national security affairs , eight senators , and six congressmen were present , but to which no member of the JCS was invited . On other occasions , the Joint Chiefs were consulted after the fact , primarily to legitimize decisions already made . For example , during the Cuban missile crisis , President Kennedy met with the JCS after he had tentatively decided on a blockade , and he became annoyed with the chiefs because they would not endorse his decision . The JCS preferred a more violent response , either an air strike or an invasion . In the Bay of Pigs episode of 1961 , the Joint Chiefs were asked to give their opinion of a plan plan and only discovered the existence of the operation by accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was based on the mistaken impression that the operation had already been ratified by President Kennedy . When they have been consulted before decisions have been made , the chiefs usually have been very cautious about using military force . The JCS recommended noninvolvement in the Hungarian revolt of 1956 , the Suez Canal campaign of that same year , and the Congo crisis of 1960 . In addition , the JCS opposed any steps to tear down the Berlin Wall in 1961 or the commitment of troops to Laos in 1962 . The JCS also opposed retaliating against North Korea after the Communist nation captured the Pueblo in 1964 and shot down an EC-121 aircraft in 1969 . The chiefs also were opposed to intervening in the Middle East to save the government of Lebanon in 1958 or that of Jordan in 1970 . However , when the President has resorted to armed intervention , the chiefs have generally supported the quick application of overwhelming force . During the debates over intervention in IndoChina in 1954 and Laos in 1961 , the JCS supported the involvement of American troops only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear weapons if necessary . Like- wise , in the Dominican crisis of 1965 , after the intervention decision had been made , the JCS advised the President to commit 22,000 troops and a large number of ships to prevent a Communist takeover . Let us move now to a discussion of Korea and Vietnam to see if the impact of the JCS is different once the shooting starts . Officially the Korean War lasted for just over three years , from late June 1950 until July 1953 . However , most of the real decisions about conducting the war took place within the first year ; one year after the outbreak of hostilities , negotiations between the United Nations forces and the Communist side had already begun . The peace conference deadlocked for two years over the issue of prisoner of war repatriation , and battlefield action was confined primarily to a " battle for hills " along a fairly static front very close to the original North-South demarcation line . It was during the first year of the war that the Truman administration was confronted with the actual attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American response , the massive Chinese intervention , the insubordination by MacArthur , and the Russian call for peace talks . This chapter will focus on the part that the Joint Chiefs played in those five episodes that first hectic year of the Korean War . Soon after the passage of the National Security Act , President Truman instructed Secretary of State Marshall to request a JCS estimate of the importance of South Korea from the point of view  | of the military security of the United States . The JCS recommended that the 45,000 men stationed in South Korea could be used more profitably elsewhere and should be evacuated as soon as possible for three reasons . First , the huge reductions in defense spending left the United States with a skeleton military force . As noted in chapter three , defense spending had fallen from $85 to $10 billion between 1945 and 1950 . The 45,000 troops in South Korea represented about 9 percent of the total Army strength in the fall of 1947 . Although occupation of the Korean peninsula could allow an enemy to threaten Japan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States to justify a commitment of 9 percent of our ground troops . Second , the JCS felt that the next war would probably be a total war with the Soviet Union and would most likely be precipitated by an attack upon America 's first line of defense in Western Europe . Therefore , the vast majority of the limited resources of this country should be concentrated in Europe . In a total war with the Russians , the Korean peninsula would be of minor strategic importance at best . Third , defending Korea presented huge logistic difficulties . It was 5,000 miles from the United States and its terrain was unsuitable for the application of American military power . General Bradley summarized the problems of a war in Korea when he succinctly stated that the chiefs hoped that the United States would never have to fight in Korea because it is such a poor place to fight . ' Accordingly , the troops were withdrawn in 1948 , and over the next two years both Secretary of State Acheson and General MacArthur , the Far East commander , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense perimeter . When the North Koreans attacked on June 25 , 1950 , American forces in South Korea consisted of a 500-man military advisory group .  | Despite the fact that they too had excluded Korea from the American defense perimeter , the Joint Chiefs eventually joined Truman 's other advisors in supporting the decision to intervene militarily on the Korean peninsula . However , the recommendation to intervene originated with the Secretary of State , not with the JCS or even the Department of Defense . As Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson later testified , " Neither I nor any member of the Military Establishment . . . recommended we go into Korea . The recommendation came from the Secretary of State . . . . " The Joint Chiefs of Staff supported the decision to intervene , but not because they had changed their opinion about the strategic importance of Korea . Indeed , all during the deliberations , which spanned five days and five meetings with the President , the chiefs consistently argued that Korea was of no strategic value to the United States . Rather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that failure to respond to direct Communist aggression in Korea would whet the aggressor 's appetite and would undermine the credibility of an American response to aggression in other more important locations . According to Bradley , the JCS thought that the Soviet move in Korea was a " softening up operation " and " the first step on a timetable of aggressions , the final stage of which , if uninterrupted , would be World War III . " Air Force Chief Vandenberg stated the JCS " believed that somewhere , sometime we had to stop being pushed around , " and that we had " to afford some hope to those people , who lined themselves up with us , that they could expect some assistance from the United States . " Army Chief of Staff Collins supported the intervention on the same grounds as the other chiefs , but added an additional justification . Failure to stop the aggression in Korea would doom  | the United Nations to the same fate as befell the League of Nations . Collins told Congress that the United Nations " may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is proven completely ineffective , I think we ought to do everything in our power to make it work . " The Joint Chiefs initially disagreed over the form of the American response . On the day of the attack , Admiral Sherman and General Vandenberg advised the President that naval and air power would be sufficient . Army General Collins and General Bradley disagreed and argued that ground troops would be needed . The President initially authorized only air and naval attacks , but five days after the invasion MacArthur reported to Collins that North Korea was routing the South Koreans and that only American ground troops could save the situation ; he asked for authority to send two divisions to the beleaguered area . MacArthur 's recommendation was considered at a meeting at the White House on June 30 and was unanimously approved by all of Truman 's civilian and military advisors , including the JCS . However , Sherman and Vandenberg approved the decision quite reluctantly . Sherman felt that the decision to commit infantry to battle was unavoidable , but that fighting Asiatics on the Asian mainland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be disengaged as soon as it became feasible . At this same meeting , the President and his advisors discussed Chiang Kai-shek 's offer to send 33,000 troops to Korea . The President was inclined to accept the Generalissimo 's offer but was opposed by Acheson and the JCS . The Secretary of State felt that introducing Chinese Nationalist forces would bring in the Chinese Communists . The Joint Chiefs argued that Chiang 's forces were not likely to be of much help against Soviet armor and that American transportation facilities could be better used for our own troops and supplies . The President was persuaded by these arguments and reluctantly declined Chiang 's offer . Prior to announcing his decision to commit American ground  | troops , President Truman met with about thirty congressmen to inform them of his decision . At this meeting , Senator Alexander Smith ( R-N.J. ) suggested that the President seek a congressional resolution approving this action . On July 3 , 1950 , the President assembled a group of fourteen people , including Bradley , at Blair House to discuss Smith 's suggestion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to accepting Smith 's suggestion . He stated that the majority in Congress were satisfied and that the irreconcilable minority might delay and debate the resolution so that its effect would be diluted . Bradley 's view prevailed and , partially as a result of the efforts of the Chairman of the JCS , the nation , without backing from its legislative branch , embarked upon a war that would result in over 30,000 American deaths . The Scope of the Involvement : Inchon , The 38th Parallel , and the Chinese Intervention Despite the fact that the Joint Chiefs unanimously supported the involvement of American ground troops in Korea , they wanted to avoid becoming too deeply involved in that Asian peninsula . Although the North Korean attack had loosened the budgetary restrictions , it would take time to build up American strength to what the chiefs considered an acceptable level . For the JCS , Europe was still the area of most importance , and while they wanted to repel the North Korean invasion , they were not sure to what extent they were willing to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suffered from no such indecision , and within two weeks after the invasion , MacArthur was forcing the JCS to take a definite stand on the way in which the war would be conducted . On July 7 , MacArthur informed the JCS that he planned to defeat the North Koreans by means of an amphibious strike deep behind their lines at Inchon , a west coast post near Seoul . Two  | weeks later , the general cabled the JCS that he planned to land two divisions at Inchon on September 15 , 1950 . MacArthur favored an amphibious operation over a frontal assault because the latter would involve higher casualties . He selected Inchon because of its proximity to the capital and because the poor landing conditions there made it an unlikely target . In preparation for " Operation Chromite , " as the landing would be called , MacArthur asked the JCS to send him at least eight divisions and all component services , including an airborne regimental combat team and an armored group of four medium tank battalions . Dispatching these 250,000 troops to Korea would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve in the United States . Initially , the JCS vigorously opposed MacArthur 's plan , for two reasons . First , the poor landing conditions at Inchon made an amphibious operation there extremely risky , about a 5,000-to-1 shot , in their estimation . Second , the operation would require the commitment of so many forces so quickly that the strategic reserve in the United States would be practically stripped bare , Japan would be left undefended , and the Pusan perimeter , our last foothold in Korea , would be seriously jeopardized . Although the Joint Chiefs were strongly opposed to Operation Chromite , they were reluctant to challenge MacArthur directly , for four reasons . First , as a rule , military staff officers are reluctant to overrule the on-scene commander from a distance of thousands of miles . Second , the JCS on the whole had had little experience in Asia . Only Sherman had spent a significant part of World War II in the Pacific Theatre . Third , MacArthur was senior to the JCS , both in age and in rank . The Far East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only fifty-five . MacArthur was the superintendent of the academy when Vandenberg was a cadet . Moreover , MacArthur was a five-star general , while the chiefs had only four stars . Fifth , and probably most important , there was MacArthur 's personality and his prior relationships with the Pentagon hierarchy .  | MacArthur 's personality and his strained relationships with the Pentagon hierarchy became crucial variables in determining the attitude of the JCS toward him during his tenure as the operational commander . The general was not just another field commander . He was a legend in his own time , a prominent national figure in the United States since he strode through the trenches in World War I armed only with a riding crop . After serving as superintendent of the military academy and as Chief of Staff under Franklin Roosevelt , he retired to the Philippines only to be called out of retirement to assume command of the desperate battle against the Japanese . MacArthur not only waged a successful campaign , but again captured the public 's imagination with his dramatic promise to return to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Allied powers , he ruled Japan almost single-handedly , often defying the requests of the civilian heads of the Allied governments , including President Truman . When MacArthur was given command of the United Nations forces in Korea , the New York Times editors summed up the general feeling about MacArthur when they wrote : " Fate could not have chosen a man better qualified to command the unreserved confidence of the people of this country . Here is a superb strategist and an inspired leader , a man of infinite patience and quiet stability under adverse pressure ; a man equally capable of bold and decisive action . " Only two people in the Pentagon had anywhere near the prestige of MacArthur . They were Secretary of Defense George Marshall and Chairman of the JCS Omar Bradley . Marshall , whom President Truman called " the greatest living American , " was the same age as MacArthur and , like him , a five-star general and a former Army Chief of Staff . In addition , Marshall had also held the distinguished position of Secretary of State . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but harmonious . Between the world wars , Chief of Staff MacArthur was alleged to have prevented then Colonel Marshall from be- coming a general . But during World War II their roles were reversed . Chief of Staff Marshall was now superior to Far East Commander MacArthur . Moreover , Marshall adopted the philosophy that the war in Europe was America 's first priority , much to the dismay of MacArthur who was fighting in Asia and felt that it deserved priority . After World War II , Marshall failed to arrange a truce between the Nationalists and Communists in China and was blamed by MacArthur for the beginning of the crumbling of American power in continental Asia . Bradley was a member of West Point 's class of 1915 , the " Class of Generals . " Among his famous classmates was Dwight Eisenhower . Like Marshall and MacArthur , Bradley had served as Army Chief of Staff , and in the fall of 1950 would also become a five-star general . Because of Bradley 's close personal and professional association with Marshall , his relations with MacArthur suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Defense . Bradley and Marshall had served together at the infantry school from 1929 to 1933 , and Bradley had served as assistant secretary of Marshall 's general staff from 1939 to 1941 . During World War II , Bradley subscribed to Marshall 's view of the priority of Europe over Asia and was a distinguished commander in the European theater . Bradley led the 1st Army in the Normandy invasion and , during the drive to the Rhine , commanded the 12th Army Group , consisting of four armies and 1.3 million men , the largest body of American soldiers ever to serve under one field commander . The JCS therefore had to be wary of overruling a commander with such wide public support and prestige , and Bradley and Marshall had to be on guard lest their opinions about MacArthur be perceived as a continuation of their personal difficulties with the general . The JCS was not alone in opposing the Inchon landing . Administration officials , the Navy and Marine commanders who would have to execute the plan , and General Walker , commander  | of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too risky . Two attempts were made to talk MacArthur out of the landing . In early August , Averell Harriman , the President 's personal representative , and Generals Ridgway and Norstad , deputy chiefs of staff for Collins and Vandenberg , met with MacArthur , and in late August , Sherman and Collins of the JCS went to Tokyo . Despite the strenuous arguments raised by these men against Chromite , MacArthur refused to budge and eventually persuaded everyone that the operation was at least " not impossible . " Admiral Sherman , the most skeptical of all the chiefs , finally approved and said , " I wish I had that man 's confidence . " On August 29 , the Joint Chiefs of Staff formally , if somewhat reluctantly , approved the landing . Their reluctance was shown about a week before the start of the operation , when they asked MacArthur if the landing could be postponed . Operation Chromite was not postponed and succeeded beyond all expectations . But the success of the operation soon presented the administration and the JCS with new problems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleared South Korea of Communist troops and MacArthur asked for permission to pursue the fleeing troops into North Korea . The Joint Chiefs were still wary of being drawn too deeply into Korea and feared that entrance of American forces into North Korea might provoke Soviet and Chinese intervention . The chiefs were also unwilling to overrule MacArthur so soon after the spectacular success at Inchon . Therefore , the JCS recommended to the administration that MacArthur be allowed to conduct military operations north of the 38th parallel to destroy the North Korean Army provided that he adhere to certain restrictions . First , the general had to submit all his plans to the JCS for approval . Second , operations in the North were contingent upon the nonintervention of the Russians and the Chinese . Third , MacArthur 's forces could not cross the Manchurian or Soviet borders . Fourth , no non-Korean ground forces were to be used in the northern provinces , which bordered Manchuria .  | Finally , air and naval action against Manchuria and the Soviet Union was not permitted . President Truman approved the JCS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Within the next two weeks , two events occurred which were to strain the relationship between MacArthur and the JCS and the President and eventually lead to the dismissal of the field general . First , at the same time that the JCS restrictions were transmitted to MacArthur , General Marshall , who had taken over as Secretary of Defense , sent a personal message to the commander . Marshall 's " eyes only " telegram told MacArthur he was not to feel hampered tactically or strategically as he proceeded across the 38th parallel . Marshall sent the message as a good will gesture on his part because of his past difficulties with MacArthur . The secretary also wanted to soothe MacArthur 's feelings over having to submit his plans to the JCS for approval . The message was not cleared or coordinated with the Joint Chiefs , and MacArthur was later to imply that this message voided the JCS restrictions . Second , in mid-October , Truman and Bradley flew to Wake Island to confer with MacArthur . At this meeting , MacArthur assured the Commander in Chief and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter the war . The general would later argue that his prediction was based upon the understanding that , if the Chinese did enter , the restrictions against the use of military power against China would not apply . Truman and Bradley contended that no such assurance was given to MacArthur . After being given permission to move north of the 38th parallel , MacArthur moved rapidly toward the Yalu River . The pace of the advance and the wide dispersion of allied forces alarmed the JCS . The chiefs thought that MacArthur had spread himself too thin and would be very vulnerable to an attack should the Chinese decide to make one . Moreover , it was clear to them that MacArthur was violating their directive about using American forces in the northern provinces . The JCS felt that the use of American  | troops near the Chinese frontier would unnecessarily provoke the Chinese . When the JCS questioned MacArthur about this use of American forces , the theater commander replied that his decision had been prompted by military necessity . Although they realized that this was setting a dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would ignore them anyway , and the only sanction against a recalcitrant commander , dismissal , was out of the question . Neither they nor the administration was ready for such a step so soon after Inchon . Throughout November , MacArthur 's dispersed forces advanced rapidly toward the Yalu . On November 17 , MacArthur informed the JCS that he would start a general offensive toward the Yalu , and on November 24 , 1950 , MacArthur flew to Korea and announced to the press that American troops would be home by Christmas . That same day the JCS " suggested " that , in order not to provoke the Chinese , MacArthur stop on the high ground commanding the Yalu River and spare the hydroelectric plants in North Korea . MacArthur brushed aside this suggestion as utterly impossible and the Joint Chiefs once again refused to give him a direct order . Four days after MacArthur 's announcement of his " home by Christmas offensive , " the Chinese launched a massive attack on the advancing , widely dispersed Americans and sent them reeling backward into South Korea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we now had an entirely new war on our hands , and on December 3 , MacArthur advised the chiefs that , unless positive and immediate action to widen the war was taken , the United Nations forces would ultimately be destroyed . This time , the Joint Chiefs did not allow themselves to be intimidated by MacArthur . They refused to give MacArthur more troops , nor would they allow him to widen the scope of the war . Moreover , they directed the general to prepare for the evacuation of Korea if necessary . It was their opinion that the Chinese were strong enough to drive our forces out of Korea if they chose to apply  | their full strength , but the Joint Chiefs were not willing to increase our effort there to prevent this from happening . To the JCS , this was now the wrong war at the wrong time , in the wrong place , and with the wrong enemy . However , the chiefs never had to face the situation . In early January , Collins and Vandenberg flew to Korea to assess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 17 , they reported that the emergency had passed and that the United Nations forces were now ready to resume the offensive . One week later these forces launched a counterattack , which lasted two months and drove the Communist forces back north of the 38th parallel . For the next two years U.N . and Communist forces took turns launching offensives and counteroffensives . Neither succeeded in moving the other side very far , and the final ceasefire line in July 1953 was nearly identical to the northern-most advance of the U.N . counterattack . The stalemate on the battlefield proved very frustrating to MacArthur . He mistakenly assumed that the military views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff coincided with his and that their directives to him were occasioned by pressure from civilian leaders . Therefore , he constantly spoke out against the immoral war of attrition and urged the administration to seek victory by carrying the war to the Chinese mainland , unilaterally if necessary . Now that MacArthur 's reputation for infallibility had been tarnished by the Chinese entrance into the war and their success against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer afraid to overrule MacArthur , even on military grounds . General Vandenberg , the Air Force Chief of Staff , stated that  | there were three reasons why the bombing of Manchuria would be militarily unwise . First , destruction of the cities of mainland China would be inconclusive because China 's arsenals lay in the Soviet Union . Second , the attrition resulting from such an attack would leave this nation 's air arms naked for several years and undermine our deterrent capability . Third , going it alone in Asia could mean going it alone in Europe and could deprive the United States of its bases in Europe and North Africa . This would require a five- to six-fold increase in the size of the Air Force . Admiral Sherman argued that an economic blockade against China would be too limited in its effectiveness to bring pressure upon the Chinese to end the war quickly . Sherman felt that the limitations arose from two considerations . First , China was so economically undeveloped that the blockade would not have much effect . Second , the long Chinese-Russian border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bradley and Collins felt that China could not be defeated without a total commitment of almost all of this nation 's ground troops . These Army leaders argued that committing this many troops to Korea would weaken us to the point that the Soviets might be tempted to launch a ground attack elsewhere . JCS resistance to MacArthur 's proposals made it easier for the Truman administration , which was also opposed to widening the war , to turn down the field commander . The general became so frustrated by the unwillingness of the people in Washington to accept his advice that in the spring of 1951 he took a series of actions which led to his downfall . On March 24 , 1951 , MacArthur issued a statement which threatened the Chinese with retaliation against their homeland if they did not make peace . This public pronouncement undercut an ongoing administration effort , which MacArthur had been informed of by the JCS , to secure a cease-fire at the 38th parallel . In early April , MacArthur wrote a letter to House minority leader Joseph Martin ( R-Mass. ) agree- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nationalist forces in Korea . When Martin made the letter public , Truman asked his advisers what should be done about MacArthur 's defiance . The JCS met with Secretary Marshall and unanimously agreed that MacArthur had encroached upon the authority of the President and should be relieved of all his commands and be replaced by Lieutenant General Matthew B. Ridgway , then commander of the 8th Army in Korea . JCS relations with Ridgway and his successor , Mark Clark , were considerably different than they had been with MacArthur . Neither of these officers had the stature of their five-star predecessor , and both were in sympathy with the Joint Chiefs ' limited war strategy . Moreover , for the duration of the war , the battlefront was relatively static and there were no major innovations like Operation Chromite to be considered . The real action had shifted to the peace table at Panmunjom , where the main issue revolved around the question of forcible repatriation of prisoners of war . The military operations that did take place were all coordinated with the JCS . Ridgway could hardly have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of staff of the Army during the early days of the Korean War , Ridgway had consistently challenged the Joint Chiefs to rein in their overzealous field commander . Although their relations with the field commanders improved , the Joint Chiefs now began to experience difficulties in a different quarter . When they supported Truman 's firing of MacArthur and by implication the President 's limited war strategy before the Congress , they attempted to do so as professional military officers . However , these issues were so interwoven with partisan politics that the Joint Chiefs of Staff became identified as administration spokesmen and exhausted their political influence . Thus , Taft insisted and Eisenhower agreed that a Republican administration must bring in a new group of chiefs .  | For purposes of establishing eligibility for veteran 's benefits and military decorations , Vietnam officially became an American war in August 1964 . However , as many studies have established , the United States was involved in Southeast Asia long before that date . For purposes of analysis , American involvement in the war in Vietnam can be broken down into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; massive involvement , from 1964 to 1968 ; and withdrawal , from 1968 to 1973 . Let us now look at the role the JCS played in each of these stages . The United States actually became involved in Vietnam one month prior to the Korean War when Acheson decided to aid French forces in Indochina as a means of encouraging full French support for European defense . However , the first JCS position on Southeast Asia was not stated until almost two years after the outbreak of the Korean War . In a memorandum to Secretary of Defense Marshall , dated March 3 , 1952 , the Joint Chiefs argued that a Communist victory in Southeast Asia , or any place else in the world , directly involved a loss for the Western world . However , the chiefs stopped short of recommending American military involvement in a second Asian country . It was not until the spring of 1954 , one year after the Korean armistice , when the French military position in Vietnam deteriorated rapidly , that the question of intervention by American forces in that area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Admiral Radford , chairman of the JCS , pushed hard for direct American involvement . Radford went so far as to tell French officials that he would  | do his best to obtain the intervention of American carrier aircraft at Dien Bien Phu . The Eisenhower administration vacillated on the brink of intervention from April through June , when it finally became clear that the military situation had deteriorated so badly that American intervention would be useless . During the debates over intervention , one of the principal restraints on American involvement was the negative reaction of Radford 's fellow chiefs , particularly Army Chief of Staff Ridgway . In May , the JCS sent a memorandum to Secretary of Defense Wilson in which they argued that , as a whole , Indochina was devoid of decisive military objectives and that the allocation of more than token American armed forces would be a serious diversion of our limited capabilities . That same month , Ridgway sent a team of Army experts to Indochina to assess the situation . Their report , which Ridgway passed quickly to Eisenhower , showed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of American intervention would be about $3.5 billion annually . However , the JCS did agree that if the decision to get involved were made , the United States should use only air and naval power from outside Indochina unless the Chinese Communists also intervened . In that eventuality , the chiefs recommended using atomic weapons against military targets in North Vietnam and China and blockading the coast of China . It was clear that the JCS did not want a repeat of the Korean limited war scenario one year after we had extricated ourselves from Asia . However , this was the last time that the Joint Chiefs would serve as a brake on our involvement in Vietnam . Over the next fifteen years , the chiefs consistently advised the elected and appointed civilian officials to commit more and more resources to Southeast Asia . After the Geneva Accords of July 1954 , the United States decided to assume the burden of defending the South Vietnamese government of Ngo Dinh Diem . To accomplish this goal , the Eisenhower administration decided to send economic and military aid  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American involvement on the side of Diem and warned that it was hopeless to expect an American military training mission to achieve success without a reasonably strong , stable civilian government in control . Moreover , the chiefs felt that the military could not do an adequate job under the 685-man limit imposed by the Geneva Accords . Despite some complaints from the military and despite the worsening situation in Vietnam , Eisenhower refused to increase the size of the military training mission beyond the limits set by the Geneva Accords . But within five months after Kennedy took over , the Joint Chiefs were pressing him for a substantial increase in the number of advisors in Vietnam . There were several interrelated reasons for the apparent turnabout of the JCS position in regard to American involvement in Vietnam in May 1961 . First , this group of chiefs viewed Southeast Asia in a different context than had their predecessors . Since the mid-195Os , the struggle with Communism had shifted to wars of national liberation in the third world . If the Communists were to take power in South Vietnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precedent and might encourage Communist insurgencies elsewhere . According to their chairman , Lyman Lemnitzer , the loss of South Vietnam would be a serious setback for the United States and would result in the " Free World 's " losing Asia all the way to Singapore . Second , the JCS was desirous of showing America 's firmness to the Communists . The United States had looked anything but firm in the April 1961 Bay of Pigs fiasco . Third , the JCS was anxious to establish a logistic base and a legal precedent for the entry of American troops into the area before the situation in South Vietnam deteriorated too much . The chiefs did not want a repeat of the Laotian situation where the nonCommunist position was so desperate and American facilities so inadequate that the JCS felt the United States could not save the non-Communists without resorting to nuclear weapons . Finally , the  | Joint Chiefs felt that a deployment to Vietnam would strengthen their case for an increase in defense spending over the restrictive ceilings of the Eisenhower period . Although the chiefs were ostensibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training mission , their real interest was in getting American combat forces into Vietnam . The Joint Chiefs were willing to accept the " training mission role " only as a pretext to avoid having Diem and certain civilian officials oppose the increased troop levels . The JCS request was ignored by the White House until late September , when President Diem , with the concurrence of Admiral Harry Felt , CINCPAC , asked Washington for a bilateral treaty and an accelerated build-up . At a hastily called meeting of the National Security Council on October 11 , 1961 , the Joint Chiefs of Staff advised the President that 40,000 American troops would be needed to clean up the Viet Cong and an additional 128,000 would have to be sent if North Vietnam and China intervened . Kennedy decided that the matter was urgent enough to send his special assistant for military affairs , Maxwell Taylor , and the then head of the State Department 's planning council , Walt Rostow , to Vietnam to assess the situation . Taylor 's report , which was delivered in November , recommended a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted most of these forces to be logistic , but admitted that some combat troops would be necessary for defense of the logistic forces . He felt that these troops could help the Diem government cope with the floods then ravaging South Vietnam and would assure the South Vietnamese president of our readiness to join him in the event that a military showdown with the Viet Cong or North Vietnamese became necessary . The JCS , along with Secretary of Defense McNamara and Deputy Secretary Gilpatric , supported Taylor 's recommendations but added four admonitions . First , the United States must commit itself to the clear objective of preventing the fall of South Vietnam .  | Second , the troops recommended by Taylor were only the first step and by themselves could not tip the scales decisively . Third , the struggle could be prolonged and costly and Hanoi and Peking might intervene overtly . Fourth , the commitment could involve the use of as many as six divisions or 100,000 men . On November 22 , 1961 , Kennedy decided to send support troops and advisors , but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16,000 and the Joint Chiefs were allowed to begin planning for a combat commitment . Moreover , Kennedy established a major military command in Vietnam , the Military Assistance Command , Vietnam ( MACV ) and appointed Taylor 's friend , Paul Harkins , to the post . Although the Joint Chiefs approved of Kennedy 's decision to increase the number of Americans in Vietnam , they felt that much more needed to be done . Thus , in early January 1962 , they sent a memorandum to McNamara and Kennedy outlining their feelings . The chiefs asked the civilian leaders to once again consider their recommendations of the previous May to deploy suitable American forces to Vietnam . The chiefs warned that a failure to do so would merely extend the date when such action must be taken and that the ultimate task would become proportionately more difficult . Despite the chiefs ' dire predictions of impending doom , Kennedy 's dispatch of advisors seemed , at least for 1962 , to have stemmed the tide in Vietnam . In March 1962 , Secretary McNamara , two members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to South Vietnam , gathered in Honolulu to assess the situation , and all agreed that it looked encouraging . In December of that year , General Earl Wheeler , the Army Chief of Staff , journeyed to Vietnam to evaluate the situation first hand . He too returned with a favorable report for his fellow chiefs . Wheeler went so far as to say that based on the progress made in 1962 , it was not too optimistic to project that the insurgency could be brought under control by the end of 1965.46 Admiral Felt at CINCPAC also predicted victory within three years . In his last  | state of the union message , delivered on January 14 , 1963 , President Kennedy proclaimed that the spearpoint of aggression had been blunted in Vietnam . Later analysis showed that such optimism resulted from biased reporting by the Military Assistance Command in Vietnam . Taylor , who was now chairman of the JCS , had instructed Harkins to be optimistic in his reporting and the field commander had instructed his subordinates accordingly . Army Colonel John Paul Vann , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to brief the Joint Chiefs on the true situation after his return from Vietnam , but Taylor , on the advice of Harkins , had him taken off the JCS agenda on July 8 , 1963 . Although South Vietnamese forces may have been making apparent statistical progress in the field , political decay was setting in rapidly in the capital . The government of Diem was becoming daily more remote , aggressive , and corrupt . The actual spark of revolt was struck in Hue on May 8 , 1963 , when government troops fired into a crowd of Buddhists displaying religious banners in defiance of a Diem decree . During the summer , mass demonstrations and immolations took place all over the country . The American government tried in vain to persuade Diem to meet some of the Buddhist demands . By late August , South Vietnamese army generals , who were conspiring against Diem , sought official American support . Members of the Kennedy administration were divided over the question of cooperating in the overthrow of the South Vietnamese president . Roger Hilsman and Averell Harriman from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Diem , while Maxwell Taylor , the chairman of the JCS , strongly objected to American approval of a coup against the Saigon leader . The debate in Washington was mirrored in Saigon , where Ambassador Lodge and General Harkins were divided over the question of the coup . During the debate in Washington , Taylor kept Harkins informed of what was happening and instructed the field  | commander on how to color his reports to Washington in order to buttress the case for keeping Diem . In an attempt to resolve the conflict over Diem , Kennedy dispatched McNamara and Taylor to Saigon in September 1963 . Their report attempted to bridge the Harkins-Lodge gap by recommending that the United States work with but not give economic aid to Diem until he instituted certain reforms . The President decided to defer to the advice of the man on the scene and gave considerable leeway to Lodge in dealing with the plotters . The White House placed only two constraints on Lodge : he was not to become actively involved in the coup , and he was to discourage any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . An October coup was thwarted by Harkins ' admonitions to the coup leader , but on November 1 , 1963 , Diem was overthrown and assassinated . Diem 's overthrow led to political chaos in Saigon and a near collapse of the military effort . While the military leaders played musical chairs in the capital , the insurgents made large gains in the field . Moreover , for a brief moment after Diem 's death , officers in the field were able to report honestly about the war . The embassy in Saigon was startled by the reality of the situation and Lodge was on his way to Washington to report the gravity of the allied position when President Kennedy was assassinated . President Johnson was thus faced with the decision of escalating the war or seeing the insurgency succeed . The Joint Chiefs recommended that the new President take a series of bold actions in Vietnam . These actions included bombing key North Vietnamese targets , sending American ground combat troops to South Vietnam , and employing United States forces as necessary in direct action against North Vietnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse the situation but would not commit this country directly to combat . Therefore , he approved an elaborate program of covert military actions against North Vietnam , which the JCS formulated in " Operation Plan 34 A. " These opera- tions ranged from flights over North Vietnam by U-2 planes and kidnappings of North Vietnamese citizens for intelligence information , to parachuting sabotage and psychological warfare teams into the North , commando raids from the sea to blow up rail and highway bridges , and the bombardment of North Vietnamese installations by patrol boats . These destructive undertakings were begun in February 1964 , and were directed by the Joint Chiefs through the office of the special assistant to the JCS for counterinsurgency and special activities . The Joint Chiefs themselves periodically evaluated the operations for McNamara . Although the chiefs were in favor of these operations , which were initially proposed by McNamara , they warned the secretary that it would be idle to conclude that they would have a decisive effect on Hanoi 's will to aid the Vietcong . The " 34 A " operations had little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse . On March 17 , 1964 , President Johnson directed the JCS to proceed energetically to draw up plans that would enable the United States to launch retaliatory air strikes against North Vietnam on seventy-two hours notice and full scale air raids on thirty days notice . In mid-April , the JCS approved CINCPAC 's " Operation Plan 37-64 , " which tabulated how many planes and what bomb tonnages would be required for each phase of the air strikes . By mid-June the JCS had refined CINCPAC 's plan to the point of producing a comprehensive list of ninety-four targets in North Vietnam . In June the principals once again gathered at CINCPAC headquarters in Hawaii to evaluate the situation . Although all agreed that the situation in Vietnam was growing worse , the majority were inclined against further escalation . General Taylor , speaking on behalf of the JCS , warned the conferees that there was a danger of reasoning ourselves into inaction , and that from a military point of view , the United States could now function in Southeast Asia about as well as anywhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return from Hawaii , McNamara recommended to the President that major actions could be delayed for some time yet . In late July , at a National Security Council meeting called to discuss the progressively deteriorating situation in South Vietnam , the Joint Chiefs proposed air strikes by unmarked planes flown by non-American crews against several targets in North Vietnam , including the coastal bases for Hanoi 's flotilla of torpedo boats .52 Before any action was taken on the JCS recommendation , the controversial incidents in the Gulf of Tonkin took place . These incidents brought about a turning point in our involvement in Vietnam . No longer would American actions be on a very small scale . Within six months after the events in the Gulf , the United States would be engaged in the full-scale air campaign against North Vietnam that the JCS had long advocated . However , no matter what steps the administration took , the chiefs would not be satisfied . They kept asking for more and more military activity , and four years later , at the time of the Tet offensive , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had dropped more bombs on North Vietnam than this nation had dropped in all of World War II , the Joint Chiefs of Staff were still asking for increased levels of military activity . The controversial incidents in the Gulf of Tonkin took place in early August , 1964 . On August 2 , North Vietnamese patrol boats engaged the American destroyer Maddox and , on the morning of August 4 , they allegedly attacked the Maddox and her sister ship , the Turner Joy . Minutes after the second incident , McNamara convened a meeting of the Pentagon to discuss the possibilities for retaliation . Secretary of State Rusk , his assistant , William Bundy , and the JCS were in attendance . All agreed to recommend  | reprisal air strikes to the President , and while the civilian officials were informing the President of their agreement , the JCS selected four torpedo boat bases and one air storage depot as the reprisal targets . Within six hours after the second incident , McNamara approved the reprisal order , which had been prepared by the Joint Staff . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces that night of August 4 , 1964 . The Pentagon also told its forces to implement the details of OPLAN 37-64 : aircraft were pre-positioned in preparation for a sustained air war against North Vietnam . the decision to begin preparation for the sustained air war was arrived at during a meeting between McNamara and the JCS on the afternoon of August 4 . The secretary viewed it as a precautionary move , while the Joint Chiefs felt that it was one more step toward their ultimate goal of applying massive air power against North Vietnam . Indeed , within days of the Gulf of Tonkin incidents , the JCS advised the President that an air campaign was essential to prevent a complete collapse of the American position in Southeast Asia , and the chiefs suggested the initiation of a " provocation strategy , " that is , that the United States immediately undertake steps to provoke the North Vietnamese into taking actions which could then be answered by a systematic American air campaign . The Joint Chiefs felt that attempts should be made to repeat the Tonkin Gulf clashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air war received support from several quarters . One week after the reprisal attacks , Taylor , who by now had succeeded Lodge as United States ambassador to Saigon , cabled Secretary of State Dean Rusk that the Khanh regime had only a 50-50 chance of lasting out the year and that a major objective of the mission in Saigon was to be prepared to implement contingency plans against North Vietnam by January 1 , 1965 . In response to Taylor 's cable , William Bundy , the assistant secretary  | of state for Far Eastern affairs , drew up a memorandum for the President which outlined a series of graduated steps toward a possible full-scale air war to begin on the date suggested by Taylor . On August 17 , 1964 , Admiral Sharp ( CINCPAC ) told the Joint Chiefs that he agreed with the idea of a full-scale air war against North Vietnam ; however , Sharp urged the JCS not to lose the momentum of August 4 and recommended that the full-scale air strikes be initiated immediately . By the end of August , Assistant Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could culminate in a sustained air war . The President , who was in the midst of a campaign in which he had assumed the posture of a peace candidate , ordered a number of interim measures which were designed to assist the morale of the South Vietnamese and to show the Communists that we meant business , but which avoided direct large-scale American involvement . These measures were essentially a return to the clandestine measures outlined in " 34 A. " However , within the next few months , the Viet Cong took a series of steps that many people in Washington interpreted as provocations . On November 1 , the Viet Cong launched a devastating mortar barrage on American planes and facilities at Bienhoa . The JCS told McNamara that this attack was a deliberate act of escalation and a change of the ground rules under which the Viet Cong had operated up until then . The Joint Chiefs asserted that a prompt and strong response was clearly justified . They advocated an allout air campaign against the North , including B-52 attacks , and the introduction of Marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for American personnel and installations . Since November 1 was election eve , Lyndon Johnson , the peace candidate , elected to do nothing at that time . On Christmas Eve 1964 , the Viet Cong planted a bomb in the American officers ' quarters in Saigon . Again the JCS pressed for reprisal air strikes against the North . Despite the fact that this time the chiefs were  | supported vigorously in their recommendations by Taylor in Saigon and Sharp in Honolulu , the President again decided not to escalate . The JCS would not be denied thrice . When the Viet Cong attacked the U.S. military advisors ' compound at Pleiku on February 6 , 1965 , President Johnson decided to give " an appropriate and fitting response " by launching a retaliatory strike with fortynine Navy jets . When the guerrillas attacked an American barracks at Quinhon on February 11 , the President launched the sustained air war against North Vietnam , which came to be known as " Operation Rolling Thunder . " While the Joint Chiefs had unanimously recommended an air campaign against the North , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be conducted . John McConnell , the Air Force Chief of Staff , wanted a short and violent twenty-eightday campaign that would begin in the southern part of North Vietnam and work its way progressively north . During these twenty-eight days , all ninety-four targets on the list drawn up by the JCS would be destroyed and all of the planes in our air arsenal , even the giant B-52s , would be employed . The other chiefs endorsed a " line of communication ( LOC ) cut " proposal made by Admiral Sharp . This program would have American planes first destroy all the roads and rail lines in North Vietnam to isolate her from China and force her to supply the South by sea . The United States would then bomb North Vietnam 's port facilities . Eventually the chiefs envisioned bombing industries outside populated areas , and finally Hanoi and Haiphong if necessary . However , the Joint Chiefs realized that their ability to influence the bombing campaign would be diminished if they could not agree on a common policy . Therefore , McConnell abandoned his proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concepts into their LOC plan . In spite of the fact that the JCS thus unanimously endorsed this long-range bombing proposal , it was not accepted . In the early stages of the air war , the Presi- dent retained almost complete daily control over attack concepts and target selection . Eventually the President was forced to select the targets in weekly packages and allow the on-the-scene commanders to select the precise timing of the individual attacks . Decisions on targets , type of bombs , and flight plans for the aircraft were made at the Tuesday luncheons at the White House . Besides the President , Rusk , McNamara , Helms ( the CIA director ) , and Rostow ( the National Security advisor ) were regular attendees . No military man was included until the summer of 1967 , when Chairman Wheeler was added . Lyndon Johnson never relinquished or delegated control over the air war to anyone outside the White House . For the duration of his term , he remained the target officer . But the President eventually did approve almost all of the ninety-four targets on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow to satisfy the Joint Chiefs . " Rolling Thunder " operations had almost no effect on the war in the South , and a few weeks after the initiation of the bombing campaign , the military leaders began to bombard the President from all directions with requests for the introduction of large numbers of American combat troops into South Vietnam . Within ten days after the start of the sustained air war , General Westmoreland asked for two Marine battalions to guard the air base at Danang . On March 12 , 1965 , Harold K. Johnson , the Army Chief of Staff , after making a fact-finding trip to Vietnam , recommended the dispatch of one American division to hold coastal enclaves and defend the Central Highlands , and the creation of a four-division force of American and SEATO troops to patrol the demilitarized zone and Laotian border areas . On March 20 , the JCS , as a body , proposed sending two American divisions and one South Korean division to South Vietnam for offensive combat operations . The next week General Westmoreland submitted a request for seventeen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more troops would be required if the bombing continued to fail to slow down infiltration.  | President Johnson turned down the largest of these requests . He sent only four Marine battalions for base security and increased support forces by 20,000 . Johnson 's decision was supported by Ambassador Taylor , who felt the South Vietnamese would resent the presence of too many foreign troops . Moreover , the ambassador did not believe that there was any military necessity for them . However , Taylor broadly interpreted the role of the Marines providing base security and allowed them to mount mobile counterinsurgency operations anywhere within fifty miles of the base , thus making them combat troops . Although the Joint Chiefs did not get their three division plan approved , they asked for and received permission from McNamara to go ahead and start planning for the introduction of three divisions and then decided to try to use the increase in support troops as a way of actually putting in more combat troops . For example , one of the " support " units which they ordered in was the 173rd Airborne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which Westmoreland had long coveted . When Taylor and the civilian officials in the Department of Defense became aware of the Joint Chiefs ' action , the brigade was already en route to Vietnam . The ambassador protested but McNamara reluctantly approved the deployment of the brigade fifteen days after it had arrived in Vietnam . The deployment of units like the 173rd and the mobile counterinsurgency operations of the Marines committed the United States to a major combat role and established a precedent which would make it easier for the administration to approve the larger and larger requests that would soon come from Westmoreland and the JCS . On April 20 , 1965 , the principals once again gathered in Honolulu to assess the situation . At the time of this meeting , there were only 40,000 American troops in Vietnam . The conferees agreed to raise the level to 82,000 and recommended seeking 7,250 additional troops from Australia and South Korea . Ten  | days after the conclusion of the conference , the JCS presented a detailed plan for deployment of 48,000 American and 5,250 third country forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy activity had increased to such an extent that General Westmoreland felt it necessary to request a staggering total of forty-four battalions , or nearly five divisions , and a free hand to maneuver the troops . The size of his request , which reached Washington on June 7 , startled even the Joint Chiefs , who had never advocated more than three divisions or twenty-seven battalions . The chiefs even asked Sharp exactly what Westmoreland intended to do with all those troops . Although they thought Westmoreland 's request somewhat excessive , the Joint Chiefs did not wish to overrule the field commander . Thus , they ratified it , and , when Secretary McNamara voiced no objection , the President , in July 1965 , approved the immediate dispatch of forty-four battalions , or nearly 200,000 men , to Vietnam . Moreover , the President also granted the Military Assistance Command in Vietnam freedom to maneuver the troops . Westmoreland used this permission to initiate his disastrous searchand-destroy strategy of attrition , which emphasized controlling territory rather than population . Neither McNamara nor the Joint Chiefs were overly enthusiastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwilling to prescribe battlefield tactics from 7,000 miles away . The United States was now committed to a major ground war and the mood in Washington was to give the field commander whatever he felt was needed . Thus , in the summer of 1965 , the air war was being run from the White House and the ground war by Saigon . The Joint Chiefs were caught in between with little control over Johnson or Westmoreland but with seeming responsibility for the actions of both . This position was to prove quite disconcerting to the chiefs , and coupled with the frustrations of the political and budgetary processes , would lead them to talk of a mass resignation within two years .  | President Johnson 's decision to make a major commitment of American ground troops to South Vietnam was followed by a decision in Hanoi to increase the level of infiltration and led Westmoreland to ask for larger and larger numbers of American troops . His June request for forty-four battalions envisioned a total U.S. force of about 200,000 men . One month later Westmoreland asked for 275,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised his estimate to 443,000 , and one year after Johnson approved the forty-four battalions , Westmoreland was demanding 542,000 troops . The JCS approved each of the Saigon commander 's requests , and at each step of the escalation assured their Commander-in-Chief that South Vietnam was the linchpin of Southeast Asia . However , the Joint Chiefs were bitterly disappointed that in approving Westmoreland 's mammoth requests the President did not put the country on a wartime footing and call up the reserves . The thing that the chiefs feared most was a " political " war and a partial commitment . Nonetheless , rather than be overruled and provoke the President 's displeasure , they went along with Johnson 's strategy within the councils of government . But their true feelings were often leaked to the press or to congressional hawks . Only the brilliant negotiations of their chairman , Earl Wheeler , kept several of them from actually resigning . The Joint Chiefs did attempt to make the President aware of their perception of the realities of the situation . In June 1965 , they advised the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven or eight years to drive the Viet Cong out of South Vietnam and that a major force would have to remain there for twenty to thirty years to insure the victory . The JCS also told the Commander-in-Chief that the United States could not win in South Vietnam unless it demonstrated the will to win by appropriate strategy and tactics , by widening the air war and denying sanctuaries to the enemy . The President scoffed at the JCS figures of 1 million men and  | twenty to thirty years to insure a victory , but when General Wheeler asked if he had a more limited objective in mind , the President did not answer directly .
