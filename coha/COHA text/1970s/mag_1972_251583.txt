NEW DELHI had planned to put on a dazzling show for this week 's 25th anniversary of India 's independence from Britain . Lights were to be strung along the domes and arches of the massive red and beige sandstone government buildings in the capital ; batteries of floodlights would bathe the buildings in India 's national colors of orange , white and green . Then , shortly before the workmen were finished , Prime Minister Indira Gandhi frugally ordered the lights kept to a minimum . With inflation and the specter of another disastrous drought uppermost in many Indians ' minds , the celebrations will be fittingly austere . <P> Mrs. Gandhi 's directive unerringly caught the mood of her countrymen as they assessed the painfully slow progress of the last quarter-century-and perceived lessons for the next one . It is difficult to overestimate the hope , not only of its own millions but of many peoples round the globe , that accompanied India 's birth as the world 's largest democracy . " A moment comes , which comes but rarely in history , " declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that historic independence eve 25 years ago , " when we step out from the old to the new , when an age ends , and when the soul of a nation , long suppressed , finds utterance . " <P> So much hope invested in a venture fraught with so many pitfalls was bound to yield disappointments , and it is not to slight India to say that as a nation it is still largely a promise unfulfilled . It has yet to become a modern power with a commanding presence on the world stage . Yet the distance India has traveled is truly measurable only by the distance it had to go . For months after that August midnight in 1947 , it looked as if the newborn nation would never even make it through the first year . <P> The cause of it all was the partition of British India into two independent countries : Moslem Pakistan and predominantly Hindu India . Horrendous communal massacres broke out , and many more people became casualties in probably the greatest refugee exodus in history as 12 million Moslems and Hindus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Partition left a legacy of lasting bitterness between the two countries that has since culminated in four wasteful wars . To complicate matters further , six months after independence , Mahatma Gandhi , who had inspired and directed the march toward freedom , was assassinated . <P> Consumer Society . Gandhi 's successor , the Cambridge-educated Brahman Nehru , guided the new nation for 17 years and personally pushed through a raft of remarkable social changes . He saw to it that the 1950 constitution outlawed the age-old caste of the untouchables and guaranteed that the state shall not discriminate on the grounds of race , caste , sex or place of birth . At Nehru 's insistence , Hindu women after 2,000 years were given the right to divorce and equal property rights . He even went so far as to order his Congress Party to establish quotas for the number of women candidates to run for office . In 1966 , Nehru 's daughter , Mrs. Gandhi , became the first woman in Indian history to lead the nation .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
