He may look like just another plump , pubescent lad , but the 17-year-old Guru Maharaj Ji is worshiped as the " Lord of the Universe " by devotees* of the Divine Light Mission in many countries round the world . Nowhere is the boy guru 's universe better furnished than in the U.S. , to which he brought his movement in 1971 : a string of 45 ashrams ( retreat houses ) and information centers in 110 cities across the country tend to the spiritual needs of the Divine Light flock , whose tax-exempt offerings have furnished the teen-age Lord with , among other things , an $80,000 pad in Denver , a $400,000 estate in Malibu and an armada of limousines and racing cars . <P> Yet all is not well in the Maharaj Ji 's paradise . Taxmen have been picking over the Divine Light Mission 's finances . Even as contributions have been rising , the guru 's bookkeepers have been busy juggling some $206,000 in debts ; only recently they paid off the Houston Astrodome for a 1973 rally proclaimed " the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , worst of all , the boy 's sanctity-perhaps even his solvency-are being threatened by a family squabble : in India , the high-living guru 's mother Mataji , who claims to be the ultimate authority in the Divine Light movement , has summarily ousted him for " falling from the path . " <P> Mataji ( the name means Revered Mother ) announced that the young guru had been replaced by his eldest brother Sat Pal , who would henceforth be spiritual leader of the movement started in 1930 by their father , the late Shri Hansji Maharaj . As Mataji now tells it , the eldest brother had originally been designated as the Bal Bhagwanji ( God <P> Incarnate ) by his father even before the Maharaj Ji was born . But when the father died in 1966 and Mission control passed to Mataji , she named her eight-year-old son as the only " Perfect Master " or unique incarnation of God for this age . Possibly because he recognized that the cherubic little guru would be superior at attracting followers , Brother God Incarnate quietly agreed . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The strains within the holy family began building when Maharaj Ji , aided by some newfound American managers , took personal control of the wealthy U.S. empire when he turned 16 in 1973 . Then last year the guru wed his secretary , Marolyn Johnson , a non-Hindu former airline stewardess , and declared her to be the incarnation of the ten-armed , tiger-riding goddess Durga . Traditionally , a Hindu mother-in-law expects obeisance from her son 's wife ; instead , photos of the newlyweds began replacing those of Mataji in U.S. ashrams . When the Revered Mother invited herself to the U.S. for a visit recently , the guru and Marolyn would not even allow her to stay at the Malibu mansion . On top of that , an outraged Divine Light spokesman in India charges the young guru with , among other things , " haunting nightclubs , drinking , dancing . " He is also said to have begun eating meat , which is offensive to vegetarian Hindus .                  @ @ @
