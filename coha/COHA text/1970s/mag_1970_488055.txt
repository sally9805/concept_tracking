Step inside the converted warehouse in San Francisco 's heavily Latin Mission District and meet the Family ? , four women , three men , five children , three cats and a dog named Argus . The sign over the door says " Different Fur Trading Co. ' , " but the name  --  which came from the poet and playwright Michael McClure -- -is a put-on . The Warehouse Family , which is what the members call themselves , is a cooperative of musicians and artists living together and sharing expenses amid their thousands of dollars worth of recording equipment and musical instruments , which include a grand piano , two harpsichords and a Moog Synthesizer . The Warehouse Family is one of perhaps 100 ' communes , large and small , urban and rural , in Northern California . Nobody knows how many there are , since few - have come to the attention of the media and new ones are being formed every week . The movement began four years ago when Lou Gottlieb , with a gradUate degree in musicology from the University of California , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Limeliters , opened the gates of his Morning Star Ranch in Sonoma County north of San Francisco to anyone who wanted to live there . From woodsy , rolling Sonoma County the movement spread , to ' places like Taos and Sante Fe ( remember Easy Rider ? ) , Mendocino County in California , the Catskills and Adirondacks in New York . Simultaneously , living groups were forming in San Francisco , Berkeley , Ann Arbor , Cambridge , , New York , Los Angeles and other ' cities . First came the hippie crash-pads of Haight-Ashbury , generally run-down and filthy apartment houses , with a floating population of acid heads , speed freaks and wide-eyed little runaway girls from places like Missoula and Rahway . Mattresses on the floor , incense , candles , everybody zonked most of the time , the sex more or less public , lots of gonorrhea and hepatitis , brutality and crime . But now , ' after the Man broke up the Hashbury and the hippies moved back ' to North Beach and other parts of the city , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is not so accidental ; people seem to be consciously experimenting . Straight people too , not just hippies and freaks . Near the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco are several communes made up of doctors ( or medical students ) nurses and lab technicians , married couples with children living under the same roof with unmarried couples and single people . In Berkeley the university and the police have been trying to evict some longhairs who took over a couple of abandoned frat houses ; the street people call this particular commune The Hearst Castle . Then there 's Harrad West , a group- , marriage experiment involving four couples ; and the More-houses , seven communes in California and Hawaii , each of which shelters a dozen or so " responsible hedonists , " middle-class dropouts who live in comparative affluence and give courses on sensuality , jealousy and hexing . Fifty miles north of San Francisco , near . the ' crossroads hamlet of Marshall on Tomales Bay , the super-authoritarian Synanon organization ( it has deified its founder , Chuck Dederich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chairman Mao ) is building a Synanon City , an anthill culture if ever there was one . When Chairman Dederich shaved his head , all his worshipers did the same ; when he started wearing bib overalls , they all turned out as drugstore farmers . What started a dozen years ago in Los Angeles as a self-help organization for heroin addicts and alcoholics has Snow become a ' mini-Fascist state with delusions of grandeur . " Today Marshall , tomorrow the World , " Dederich says , and he means it . Yet another kind of commune flourishing in the ' cities is the underground  --  young hard-core revolutionaries banding together , and living together , in " affinity groups " for protection against the pigs and to insure ideologiCal purity . The ' writer knows of one such affinity group living not far from the Warehouse Family : three straight-looking couples share the expenges of a large flat , and the living-room floor is a good spot for a rebel on the run to roll out his sleeping bag . Tim Leary is probably hiding out in just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  apart from revolutionaries , who have a clear enough reason  --  want to live together , to merge their existences , even , their identities , - with other people ? Loneliness is one reason , anomie another . People today , particularly young people who have rejected Nixon-Agnew-Mitchell America , are looking , naively perhaps , for an earthly Eden ; , for the love and brotherhood , intimacy and expanded consciousness that come with joining an expanded family . ( The world recoiled in disgust from the Manson Family , but there was no doubt that Charlie 's young girls were happy to come under his wing , to belong . ) Another important element is the rejection of the city  --  smog , automobiles , the looming race war  --  for the pleasures of the bucolic life . Tilling the land , watching the seasons as they change , waking up to a cock crowing , becoming one with nature  --  all these have been and will continue to be irresistible , atavistic attractions for human beings . Lou Gottlieb , who started it , in California at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who with his flowing beard , robe and sandals , looks like an Indian holy man . He opened up his ranch in 1966 , but took a terrible amount of harassment from Sonoma County authorities , who fined him more than $15,000 for refusing to evict the hippies squatting ( a great word , squatting ! ) on his land . Gottlieb 's last defiant legal tactic was to transfer title of Morning Star to God . - Morning Star is moribund now , with only twenty or so diehards still living there . The current action is 10 miles to the southwest , on the other side of- a raw little crossroads called Occidental . There , on a big commune called Wheeler 's , 100-odd people are living in shanties and tents , tree houses and lean-tos. - The hippie panhandling on the main street of Occidental plucked compulsively at his beard as he tried to Out into words what made Wheeler 's different . " Morning Star is God 's land , " he said finally . " Wheeler 's is Wheeler 's . Wheeler runs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearded and 30 , the son of a Connecticut manufacturer . He bought the 320-acre ranch in 1963 with an inheritance , built with his own hands the only large building on the property , a big barn he uses for a painting studio now that the law wo n't let him live in it with his wife and baby daughter . Lou Gottlieb called Morning Star an " Alternate Society . " Wheeler calls his ranch the " beginning of the next civilization , the place where the Aquarian Age is starting . " Histrionics aside , Wheeler 's is idyllic , ' at least by comparison with the present metropolitan nightmare . Living is very rough there  --  deep ruts on the dirt road keep the world away , but it is not much fun slogging through the mud in the winter rains . There 's no plumbing , no electricity ; roofs leak . Several babies , including Wheeler 's , have been born there , and the communards , who mostly go naked in the summertime , look healthy , brown and wiry from their vegetarian diets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from dysentery , hepatitis , tonor rhea . Ramon Sender , a composer of " tape music " who was one of the first to move in at Morning , Star , changed over to Wheeler 's three years ago when the vibes got bad at Gottlieb 's place . He is 35 , with a black beard touched by gray , and for years now he 's walked miles every day , toting water , tilling his crops , pursuing a life he calls " voluntary primitivism . " " For ten bucks a week you can live here really well , " he said . Only about twenty have a regular source of income  --  money from home , welfare checks to women with children . At Wheeler 's the welfare mothers are the plutocrats , and their checks help buy food for everyone . There 's a communal garden , and most of the communards also have individual gardens . " My old lady , Joan , makes cheese and yogurt , " said Ramon . " Our eight chickens give an average of four eggs a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' very friendly fishermen in Bodega , 5 miles away , who bring us 100-pound boxes of fish . Orchards give us boxes of slightly damaged fruit . " Residents also work by day , pick- ' ing apples for local farmers and cleaning out stables , the manure going to fertilize the communal garden . , Diversions are few . Sex , science fiction , loafing around nude in the sun , smoking grass , dropping acid and any other drugs that happen to be around , staying stoned and out of it for days at a time . " But we have no drug problem here , " says a cheery young man with a reddish beard who began turning on when he was 12 . " The minute anybody brings any acid or dope out here , it 's split around and everybody gets stoned . Most people are high naturally anyway . " ? A big bearded man came pedaling down a path , flute in hand . He , calls himself Today and says he is an ex-surfer from Southern California who " used to own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a- shack he built in the middle of a huge live , oak ; its roof is plastic sheeting , the dooryard is littered with wine bottles and weird debris . Today loves it . " This is my last stop in life , " he sighed . " I 've searched around for an existence like this , and ai n't going no farther . " His philosophy of open land and " biodegradable architecture " make Bill Wheeler a fascinating talker . " I 'm interested in showing people how to live on the land , not destroy , it or pollute it . Grow their own food . Build their own houses . Deliver their Own babies . This is an ecological experiment with human beings the ingredients . The important thing about it is that it works . " The Warehouse Family in San Francisco is more a musicians ' cooperative ; than a commune , Money does not go into a common kitty , the relationships of the three couples plus single divorced woman plus five children are stable , monogamous  --  at least so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orgies . Again , a vegetarian diet  --  this seems to be one of the few characteristics of the new life style  --  no hard liquor , wine only occasionally , grass but no heavy drugs like LSD or hard ones like speed and smack . Very hard-working people , too . Margaret Fabrizio , the best-known harpsichordist in the San Frangisco area , said she and her fellow members got to know one another at last year 's abortive Wild West Festival . They moved into the former furniture warehouse in February , and over the months evolved into a " family . " " For the first two and a half months we did n't have a bathtub , so we either went to a sauna together or used friends ' . There was no kitchen , just a two-burner hot plate . We did n't have any heat . " The men of the , family ? John , Patrick and Frank  --  plus Margaret 's boy friend spent hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars putting in , wiring and plumbing , building the lofts where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough-hewn , bare-bones look and the good vibes of Wheeler 's barn in the country , except that this one is 3 stories tall . On the ground floor the men are building a recording studio , and they hope to make money from it . " Shaping this building has been a nice spiritual adventure , " said Frank Albright , who has shoulder-length hair , wears hillbilly clothes , and plays reed instruments and the flute . - Out in Wheeler country it 's very quiet  --  cocks crowing , birds twittering , cows mooing . But for the Warehouse Family , noise is the biggest problem they have . The wall of the third floor , which is like a huge , barren living room , is thin enough so that the drunken quarrels of the family next door can be heard over the hubbub of conversation , children 's squeals , the washing machine , the dryer , the refrigerator , eta . A pretty blonde named Pat who got tired of roughing it on a hippie ranch in Mendocino County , said she 's now so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bugged by a quiet house . " Now , " she said , " I find the silence of a house in the country just overwhelming . " - Margaret : " It 's the most difficult problem , wanting quiet and not being able to have it . SO I often get up at 6 A.M. just to wander around by myself when every body else is sleeping . " iThe furthest-out experiment the family has tried was to give the three older children a switch in parents . " Patrick is my daughter Rita 's mother and father now , " said Margaret . " And John is my other daughter Carla 's mother-father . " Meanwhile , Margaret became the all-purpose parent of an 11-year-old girl named Sydney , Patrick 's daughter , who is pleased as hell . " She told me she 's never had so ti few problems , " Margaret reported . The purpose of the experiment is to make the adults deal with one another differently , and to give the real parents the experience of shifting problems onto someone else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margaret , " and my daughters are too female-oriented . Now , John and Patrick have to , deal with their whining and that shit , and I ' get the groovy parts . I 'm their friend now . " Living so closely together has presented many emotional problems , at least at first . But the Family has a very natural , healthy attitude about sex . Consider this ribald bit of dialogue : ' Woman : " It used to make me feel funny , hearing you and make love . ' There they go again , ' I used to tell myself . Now I do n't pay any attention . " Man : " We certainly can hear everything you do . Christ , you two make the whole building shake . " Woman : " Do you remember when the kids used to spy on us ? I 'm glad they 've stopped that . " Everybody laughed at that , children included . ?
