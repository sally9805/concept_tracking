Social Anthropologist Lionel Tiger , 43 , has been ridiculed in Women 's Liberation publications for his theories on the reasons for male political domination . The author of Men in Groups , a professor at Rutgers and married , with one child , Tiger last week discussed Sexual Politics with TIME Correspondent Ruth Mehrtens Galvin . Among his observations on Author Kate Millett and her theses : <P> FOR a start , virtually all the goals that women have are perfectly justified , legitimate and desirable . One can only support them in every way . The problem , as I see it , is the analysis that they make of why things go wrong , of why there are these disadvantages . Millett tries to say that the males dominate females because they dominate females . This is her evidence of patriarchy and it therefore should be removed . It is a very peculiar way of reasoning , if all societies , everywhere , exhibit the same characteristics of male dominance . <P> Millett has raised , more directly than anyone else , some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be facing . Questions are being asked about what kind of animals we are . The hunting history , for example , is now fairly clear : we evolved as a hunter . We spent 99% of our time as hunters ; we 've been hunters until very , very recently . It 's not just a question of changing a few employment practices and a few attitudes of males and females toward each other . It 's far deeper than that . <P> The argument ultimately turns on whether one thinks that there are any differences between males and females that can be inherited . Clearly Millett thinks that there are n't . I think there are , and if we want to deal with this basic problem , we have to deal with it in terms of what it is , not in terms of our abuse of the system . We get some kind of genetic inheritance , we get all these chromosomes , we get a lifecycle . Those biological givens influence and shape a deep structure of behavior . Millett is talking about the very deepest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's talking about the breeding system : any animal 's central problem is how to reproduce , to survive enough to reproduce . Unless you 're talking about that , you 're talking about something that 's trivial . <P> Women 's Liberation is very much a minority movement . It 's evangelical . It 's a movement that makes people feel good , and there will be a lot of people reading these books who wo n't do a thing to change the conditions of their lives ; still , they like reading about revolution . In one sense it constitutes a kind of pornography ; it 's a fantasy about the different ordering of things without individuals really doing anything about the ordering . <P> There 's something that again the feminists are going to have to cope with - that males are much more fragile sexually . It 's often difficult for males to perform sexually if they do n't feel that the mood is just right . One of the problems here may be that primates physically have intercourse with females that they can dominate . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sexual politic . And that without this politic , in the way it has been contrived for several million years , there may not be any sexual encounter .
