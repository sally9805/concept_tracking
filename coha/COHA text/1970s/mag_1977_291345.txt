Having designed a program of tax cuts and spending increases to speed up the U.S. economy , Jimmy Carter must now sell his creation to his fellow Democrats who control Congress-and already they are forcing some changes . The first , but probably not the last : a recasting of the President 's now celebrated $50-for-everybody tax-rebate plan so that low-income people will get more than that , and the well-off will get nothing . <P> That change reflects a deep skepticism on Capitol Hill that the rebate plan will pep up demand enough to cut quickly into unemployment . On the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee , Barber Conable of New York , the ranking Republican , likens the passing out of $50 checks to everyone to " dropping money out of airplanes " ; New York Democrat Otis Pike grumbles that there must be a better way to create jobs . <P> Rebate Lid . Still , Congressmen can think of no other way to pump so much money into the economy so fast . So they came up with the idea of concentrating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to spend the money promptly , and denying them to the rich , who might simply put the cash in the bank . Late last week the White House agreed to a plan under which the rebate would be more than $50 for members of families that earn $25,000 or less ; $50 in the $25,000-to-$35,000 group , zero for all those above . That would keep the total size of the rebate at $11.4 billion . <P> That , however , will not end the tinkering . When Ways and Means Chairman Al Ullman this week presents to the committee his own proposals for what would eventually be called the Tax Reduction Act of 1977 , his draft is likely to contain a major revision of the President 's plans to lower business taxes . Carter wants to offer companies a choice : they could reduce their income taxes by an amount equal to 4% of the Social Security taxes they pay on each worker , or to 12% of the money they spend on new plant and equipment . Many Congressmen want to scrap both alternatives in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of workers added to payrolls . Ullman 's idea : let an employer subtract from-his income tax 25% of the wages-up to $4,200 a year-paid to a worker newly hired or recalled from layoff . <P> Publicly , Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal calls that proposal " arbitrary and capricious . " Privately , a White House aide fumes : " You try to put together the best plan you can , and then Al Ullman goes off the deep end with some crazy idea of his own . " Carter 's men argue that the proposal would unfairly benefit employers who are going to increase their payrolls anyway , tax break or no , and would encourage the wrong kind of hiring-since a company could cut its taxes just as much by employing a part-time worker at $4,200 as it could by adding a full-timer at $8,400 . Walter Heller , a member of the TIME Board of Economists , adds that the Ullman proposal would give disproportionate tax relief to companies in rapidly expanding areas like the Sunbelt but deny help to needy businesses in areas like New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in contrast , would save money for all companies whose workers are covered by Social Security , while still tying the size of the saving to the number of workers employed .
