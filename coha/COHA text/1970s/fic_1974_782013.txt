 | As IT TURNED OUT , JAYELL HIMSELF SOLVED THE PROBLEM . IN A drunken tear , he abruptly announced , " Hell , I know what she wants is a plain old ordinary house , so by God , why do n't I just build her a plain old ordinary house ! What 's she want , one of your Ranchero models , a Tara , a Magnolia Manor ? " He ripped through the drawings and magazine clippings piled on his office desk . " All right , I 'll build her the ordinariest house  --  what do I care ? She 's the one got to live in it , right ? Ai n't that what the salesmen say ? I 'll build such a box it 'll get the Smithbilt Silver Medallion ! " Em Jojohn chuckled . " You could n't build a house that looked like a house . " " Here it is . " Jayell snatched a picture from the stack . " This is what she really drooled over . A converted barn , that 's what 's big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . Je-sus , would you look at that thing ! " " You got a problem there , " said Em . " Ai n't too many New England barns around here . "  | Jayell slammed down his bottle . " My God , Em , do n't you know anything ? That 's what makes it fashionable ! People do n't want the original thing , they want reproductions ! Some slick advertising guy puts a gimmick like this in a magazine , and people say , Oh , ai n't that cute ? ' And right away want one like it . Only when they find there ai n't too many dairy farmers ready to evict their cows and fill their barns with fools , there 's a new reproduction market created . Hell , it 's the whole secret of the antique business . Yessir , we 'll build her a barn first , and then convert into a house . Them Marble Parkers will be frog-ass green with envy ! " " Marble Park ? " I said . " Are you really going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a down payment on a lot this morning . Do n't say nothing to Gwen . " " How them folks going to take to having a barn up there in them ranch styles ? " said Em . " Oh , listen , no problem there . They would n't stand for nothing really good , of course . But some cutesy notion like this , why it 'll just fit right in . Juice up the neighborhood just enough to look clever , ' but not far enough from mediocre to make ' em uncomfortable . Be cheaper too , when you think about it . I got enough barn salvage to reproduce one hell of a barn ! " The lot Jayell had bought was at the end of one of the newly paved subdivision streets . We trooped up there , the three of us and the ragged crew from Jayell 's shop , and he roved over the site , laying out the house . And from what I saw , Jayell was right ; the plans he outlined would fit right in with the carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brick split-levels predominated , plus the predictable Southern " mansions " with fluted wooden columns , but there were several scattered attempts at buttoned-down striving toward the avant-garde : two or three circular houses , a three-story obelisk with only ground-floor windows , and one fine attempt at a castle , but the sun porch gave it away . Marble Park housed the granite executives , textile managers , bankers and others of the town 's elite . It was a world of frantic golf and determined bridge parties , of dollar-down cabins at Lake Lorraine . They were the country clubbers , the Little Theater boosters , symphony supporters , Friends of the Library , a scant generation from corn  | huskings and quilting bees , but in there solid as boat payments , Spocking their children , trying . Slowly the house began taking shape , and it was plain from the start that this was to be the strangest house Jayell ever built . It was a perfectly conventional , heavy-beamed barn , so devoid of Jayell 's usual touches , his bizarre shapes and flying angles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandma Moses painting , so old-timey that it seemed to age as it grew from the ground . But if the house looked simple enough to the rest of us , for Jayell it was a torment , a crucible . He was relentlessly on the move , searching out the tiniest flaws , remeasuring , tearing out and changing , yelling in frustration , scrapping whole sections and starting again . It was always strange to watch Jayell work , the flarings of temper , the sudden peaks of happiness , the long periods of overriding confidence that dipped suddenly into melancholy , but for some reason this project seemed to challenge him as none before . He brooded over it , he began drinking more than usual when he was working , he sat in the falling night when the others had gone , slugging from the bottle he picked up each morning at Dirsey 's and staring intently at the house . I crawled up on the wood pile beside him . He was wound tight , covered with sweat and grime , trembling from exhaustion , anxiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He spoke through gritted teeth . " God is jealous of anyone who attempts to create . It 's the ultimate sacrilege . " " It is ? " " That 's why artists are so miserable . It 's their punishment . " " But how can you say that  --  you believe in God . " " You got ta believe in Him , " Jayell said , " even when He 's wrong . " " It could be they suffer because they do n't eat and sleep right too . " He whirled around on me . " Are you going home now ? " " Yes . " And I got down and did . Despite all the starts and stops and changes , the house moved along , and from the smoothness of its shape , the natural way it came together , no one would ever guess the strain it was to get it that way . It just seemed the only way that house could have been built . And it was a beautiful house . The rooms were of moderate  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ringed with cabinets and little alcoves , was airy and full of light . Nowhere did a board lie even slightly out of line ; windows and heavy oak doors moved at the touch of a finger ; and the overhead beams joined with a seeming interweaving of grains with not a razor 's thickness of gap in the joints . The furniture was less trouble than I expected . From under his bed at the shop Jayell pulled boxes of drawings , and within days the designs were emerging from his boys ' lathes and planers . The real time-consumer was finding the right fabrics and having upholstery made ; for some of the accessories and ornamental hardware Jayell had to make trips to Atlanta . Helping Jayell with the house after school and doing my homework while eating leftovers from the oven before toppling into bed , and spending as much time as I had to with Gwen Burns , was getting to be almost more than I could bear . The teacher kept her end of the bargain and never asked a word about the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , she devoted more of her attention to me . One night as I was pulling down the covers , bone-tired and already half asleep , she came to my room , eyes afire with excitement , and swiftly closed the door behind her . " Earl , may I share a secret with you ? " I said of course , expecting a sure catastrophe , and trying to clear my head enough to meet it . She came and sat on the side of the bed , looked into my eyes for a moment , and whipped out a spiral notebook . " I want to be a writer . " She waited , and when she got no reaction from me , she said , " What 's the matter , do n't you believe me ? " " Well , sure , but I do n't see why you keep it a secret . Mrs. Cline wants to be one too , and she talks about it all the time . " " Mrs. Cline ? The one with the detective magazines ? " " Uh-huh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magazines , but they do n't happen that often around here , and when one does happen she ca n't get out to see about it . It 's real sad . " " That nice little old lady . I would never have thought it . " " But she writes all the time anyway , and it 's a nuisance . Miss Esther says she 's about fed up with it . "  | The girl was shocked . " Why would she care about a thing like that ? That poor , lonely little old . . . " " Well , she would n't if Mrs. Cline would write somewhere besides the bathroom . But she wo n't ; she sits in there and writes until her legs fall asleep and then somebody 's got to help her to her room . " The teacher sat and looked at me . " Earl , I ca n't shake the feeling that you 're somehow making fun of me . " " Oh , no , it 's the truth . You can ask anybody . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? she opened the notebook and handed it to me ? " now just read it aloud and tell me what you think . I do n't expect you to grasp it all immediately , just let it seep in and see what it does to you inside , see if it evokes a response . " I looked down at the paper and could hardly believe my eyes . There were no capitals , periods or any kind of punctuation , not even paragraphs . It was all written in one big block , without a clue as to where one thought ended and another began . I looked at her to see if she was now making fun of me . " It 's all right , " she said , " it 's supposed to be that way . It 's called stream-of-consciousness . Go on , read . " So I started reading , punctuating when I gave out of breath . As best I could tell , it was a dream of some sort , with the girl describing all the things she saw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and throbbing-throated birds and melting sunsets ; but then the picture got disturbed , with " raging thoughts , like swirling bits of tissue paper , tumbling in the whirlpool of the mind . " And finally the scene opened out on a meadow , with boys and girls , and it took on a decidedly different tone . Here things got down to specifics , with " great bronzed arms " and " hot ivory bellies " and " nymphs worshiping at the steeple of life . " I stopped reading . " What 's the matter ? Are you embarrassed ? " Embarrassed ? At that age I still had trouble buying underwear from a lady clerk at Telk 's ! " All right , " she said , smiling , " but tell me , what do you think ? " " I  --  uh , I 'm not sure , I 'm afraid it 's a little over my head . " She leaned close . " But tell me , did you feel anything ? " " Oh , yes , ma'am , especially there toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " she said ecstatically . " It 's enough that you felt something . I get so discouraged in that English class , nothing moves them ! I plan the most exciting lessons , full of nuggets , I hit them  | with things that should make their hair stand on end ! And they just sit there . Every day I come away drained , the blood sucked right out of me ! " " Well , maybe we just got a dumb class . " " No , it 's the same with the other teachers , only they just seem to accept it , to go along every day drilling the facts into them , getting it back on tests , and moving them up a grade . Teaching has to be more than that , but where do you start ? " I opened my mouth , and then realized , hell , I did n't have an answer for her . " Well " ? she got to her feet ? " thank you anyway , Earl , for listening  --  for trying . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may never amount to anything , but I have to have this release . Sometimes I feel so bottled up inside . I can trust you with my little secret , ca n't I. You wo n't tell the others . " " Oh , no , ma'am , but they would n't care anyway  --  so long as you do n't write in the bathroom . " It was the wrong thing to say . She stopped at the door . " Good night , Earl , " she said coolly . " Good night . " It was no use , I thought . With some people , no matter which way you step , it 's wrong . She let up on me with the poetry and literature after that , and I thought maybe she had gotten discouraged and given up on me , and I was going to have some peace . But as it turned out a few days later , she was only gearing up enthusiasm for the court system she was establishing in civics.  | " JAYELL , YOU 'RE KILLING YOURSELF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sawhorse trestle . Since it was Saturday , Jayell , for once , had let the shop boys knock off at noon , but he had asked me to stay and help him salvage a small barn after we finished painting on the Ledbetter house . " Why do n't you quit for the weekend ? I never see you anymore . " " Promised to clear away a barn this afternoon . " Jayell ate silently , his eyes scanning the nearly finished house . " The Martins have offered us the use of their boat if we want to go down to the lake tomorrow . With cold weather coming , it 'll probably be the last chance we 'll get to go . " " Maybe , if I can get this one finished up this afternoon . Told Ledbetter I 'd give him the keys Monday , else he 's liable for another month 's rent . That time in Atlanta threw everything off . " " Jay , what kind of life are we going to have , with you working eighteen hours a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely scratch a living on these houses . Until I get the boys better trained and get some capital built up . . . "  | " I know , " she said , " and that 's why I ca n't understand why you do n't reconsider that Smithbilt offer . It sounds like a wonderful opportunity . " " How do you know about Smithbilt ? " " That man  --  Mr. Wyche ? ? was by the boardinghouse this morning . Jay , they 've . . . " She stopped and turned to watch a blue station wagon pulling up to the jobsite . She looked at Jayell sheepishly . " I told him you 'd be here this afternoon . " John Wyche , the Smithbilt vice-president , picked his way through the construction debris . " How 's it coming , Jayell ? " " Hello , John , " said Jayell , glancing at Gwen . John Wyche was a large , energetic man who had a habit of hitching his pants as he talked . " Fine-looking house you 've got there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done with a half-dozen nigger laborers than we can with a crew of skilled carpenters . " " You got too many , " said Jayell . " We do n't use two men to carry a two-by-four . " " Exactly , " said Mr. Wyche , " absolutely right . That 's what I want to talk to you about , Jayell . We 're just getting too big  --  did I tell you we 're starting a new development outside of Abbeville ? New mill going up there and they want five hundred houses ! Got the bulldozers in there now . We got to have help . Got to have help . " He stopped and looked again at the house . " My God , do you ever build any two alike ? " " Ai n't had to yet , " said Jayell , munching a stalk of celery . " Listen , Jay , I 'll come right to it . We got to have somebody to coordinate construction in this area . The Miami office is on my neck constantly about this territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what I 'm going to do . I ought to be in the office right now . This whole area is booming , and indications are it 's just getting started . New plants opening every day . That means people , Jayell , and people means houses . Now , the company sees yours scattered around the hills and they keep asking me , Who 's this fellow with such originality  --  who builds houses like that with a handful of niggers and utility-grade lumber , and why ca n't we get him on our team ? ' And frankly , Jayell , I 'm running out of answers . " Jayell smiled . " Like I 've told you , John , I 've got all I can handle . " " How much can you realize out of a little unit like this ? In the time you put up one , we build a dozen . We 're prefabbing whole sections  | now and hauling them to the job by truck . With override alone you could make three times what you 're making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John . You know it 's not the money . " " Jayell , do n't kid me . I know you 're hanging by your fingernails . Any day now you 're gon na stretch a little too far and your creditors are gon na clean you out ! Besides , how many of these things can you build on what you 're clearing ? Now , you come and get a-hold of this Abbeville thing and get it rolling , and in the meantime we 'll feed some of your ideas to our boys in Miami . Let them look them over , test the marketability , and if they think you 've got something , hell , we can turn ' em out by the hundreds . We 're interested in the lowincome housing market too . If it does n't work out , you 've made a little extra money , and you can go right on building your houses . No harm done . " Jayell looked at Gwen , whose eyes were dancing with excitement . " John , I 'm just not ready yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle it when I am ready . What you say is true , I am hanging by my fingernails , but if there 's any way to do it on my own , that 's the way I want to go . " Mr. Wyche was scribbling on the back of a business card . " Had to have my home number unlisted  --  wife 's orders  --  but you can reach me here anytime . " He handed the card to Jayell . " You think it over , Jayell , that 's all I ask , talk it over with this lovely lady , and you change your mind , you give me a call . " He turned to Gwen and took both her hands in his . " Miss Burns , it 's been a genuine pleasure . Incidentally , my son , Carl , is eagerly looking forward to trying out for the senior class play this year . Now I can well understand his sudden interest . " He turned and walked quickly back to his car , leaving Gwen with an expression of surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linebacker turns up at the tryouts , digging his toe and looking like the last man at the Little Big Horn , that 'll be Carl . " " Jayell , I do n't think you 're being fair . " " Ah , John 's all right . He just oversells sometimes . " " It sounds like a great opportunity to me . Why do n't you take a breather , go to work for them awhile and put some money in the bank . Your boys can keep this going on the side , ca n't they ? Then , when the financial pressure is off somewhat , you can attack it again . You just need a rest , Jay . "  | Jayell nodded . " But when you 've accustomed yourself to sleeping on the floor , there 's a danger in getting in a nice , warm bed . You do n't want to get out again . If I had to go either way , though , I 'd rather be out there with a construction gang than sitting in an architect 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a blue-collar , with starch in it . " " Just a clodhopper , baby . " She put her arms around his neck . " And speaking of nice warm beds . . . " Jayell kissed her . " Do n't forget to leave your window unlocked tonight . " " Jayell , how much longer are we going to play that silly game ? Why do n't I just come down to the shop ? " " ' Cause your bed 's got springs ! Besides , I kind of like being a porchclimber . Adds excitement . " " I 'm convinced Mrs. Porter 's putting a glass to the wall . " " Yeah ? Well , tonight I 'll throw her a few moans . Do her more good than her White River tonic . " " I wonder what we 're doing for him ? " Gwen nodded toward me . I got busy picking something from my sandwich . Jayell laughed . " We probably just put him through puberty . Come on , big ears , let 's go wreck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " can I come too ? " " Ah  --  no , " Jayell said quickly , " you might get hurt . Tearing down those old buildings can be tricky business . " " Well , you ca n't blame a girl for wanting to get out of doing lesson plans . Will you be late ? " " No , it 's just behind the cemetery over the hill from the boardinghouse . I 'll stop off and see you on my way back . " " Behind the cemetery ! " I said . Jayell shot me a glance . " Let 's go . " He kissed Gwen again and climbed into the truck . When we were out of earshot , I said , " The Boggs place ? The barn 's at Phaedra Boggs 's place ? No wonder you did n't want her to come along . " " Take your choice , " Jayell said . I kept my job . Why Jayell broke up with blond , long-legged Phaedra was still a mystery to me and everybody else . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County , in a rough-edged sort of way , and her reputation never seemed to bother Jayell ; certainly it was no wilder than his , though it did run him a close second , and maybe surpassed him in certain particulars , but on balance they seemed made for each other . As for me , I 'd made every effort to avoid Phaedra ever since the time I jumped out of the hedge with a cap pistol and popped a couple of shots at her as she was passing the boardinghouse , and she took the pistol away from me and beat it to pieces against a rock . There was another time , when I was seven and she was twelve , that we might have encountered each other , but after what happened before I was in no mood to help her . That was the night that the sheriff and a search party came by the house to look for Phaedra after she had been missing for a couple of days and her hysterical father , the cemetery caretaker , convinced the sheriff that one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods . Em wanted us to go along with the men and help look for her . He said it would be good for me . But there was no way I would be caught near the woods at night , unless they dragged me . I had pretty well conquered my ghosts by that time by using the methods Em had taught me , but for some reason I could not go near the woods at night . There was no way to describe or explain to him the paralyzing dread that came over me at the sight of a clump of trees shadowed by dark . I would watch them from the window of the boardinghouse or the loft as the sun set , wondering about it , trying to recall some past incident that might have caused it , imagining the friendly trees as I knew them in the daytime , full of birds and squirrels , but nothing seemed to help . As the long shadows moved jaggedly into the fields , as the gloom slowly descended with malformed shapes of white limbs , and the streaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold , nameless dread came climbing as steadily as the blood coursing toward my heart . I tried not to make a big thing of it , but when we went on a hike through the woods , or inner-tubing down the river , I always carefully calculated the time and distance to be sure we would arrive at home before dark . Fighting Em down to the loft when he was drunk , I could sometimes forget , but usually I stayed the night in the loft after I got him there . And those nights I had to get him from Dirsey 's and follow him on his rampages along the river , through the nightmarish world of licking tongues , of hostile  | creatures that touched and rubbed and skittered away and sat watching behind trees and under branches and climbed gleefully to warn others of my approach and wait ahead in other gangs for that one moment when they could get me alone  --  they all come as fervently to life in my mind as they were in those early dark days of childhood . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cemetery in search of the girl who had busted my cap pistol , I let it pass . After half a night of searching , it was Em who finally found her , hiding in a boiler in the remains of Tyndall 's still . She had run away from her father , she said , who had come home shot down on moonshine and stay-awake pills and , as usual , itching to beat somebody . He used to beat both her and her mother , Phaedra said , but since her mama had gotten sick Phaedra had to bear it all , and she was fed up . She was n't going back home come hell or high water . Sheriff Middleton had told her she was either going home or to the girl 's reformatory . She finally went home , but only after scorching Em 's ears for bird-dogging her , and sinking her teeth in the sheriff 's hand . As Phaedra moved along three years ahead of me in school , having failed a couple of grades along the way , I watched in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blond hair metamorphosed into a sleek , full-sweatered young woman . That froggy voice mellowed into a husky burr that did things to the hair on the back of your neck , and by the time she was thirteen she sported a figure that had the teachers lifting eyebrows at each other . And as she grew older , she grew wilder . There was a different sports car or hotrod buzzing over the hill through the cemetery almost every Saturday night , many of them belonging to sons of some of Quarrytown 's best families , to take her to the drive-in , to restaurants out of town , to the dances at Taylorsville  --  to take her anywhere , of course , but home . Jayell met her the year he taught at the high school , and , despite their age difference , dated her a couple of times on the sly ( more to ease his own conscience for dating a sixteen-year-old , no doubt , than any fear of the school system ) , and he said her low academic showing was n't because she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was a whiz in math and science , he said , and could rasp out plant names by the hour , many in Latin , and ripped into frogs with a savage curiosity . She loaded her homeroom with the jars of  | mosses and odorous shrubs she was always collecting from the woods , until finally her teacher , who favored delicate blooms and pretty berries , put her foot down . The trouble was , that was all Phaedra cared about , and she let her other grades die . She just would n't average out . The girl did n't know a sonnet from a soup recipe , and despite the discovery that she had an above-average singing voice , they could no more get her to join the girls ' chorus than they could lure her into the home economics kitchen . The teachers concluded that Phaedra elected the extra math and science classes just to be among the majority of boys in those classes , who were , no doubt , responsible to some degree for her high grades . One day toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the verge of failing again , she was standing at the pencil sharpener when Charley Thurston , the son of the president of the Three Angels Monument Company , whom she had dated once or twice , and no more , happened along behind her and gave her a hard pinch on her shimmying fanny . Phaedra , apparently in a sour mood , turned and smiled and gave Charley a wink , and then knocked him over a row of desks . Charley 's parents said the bridgework alone cost four hundred dollars , and Charley had played first-chair trombone . Enough was enough , the principal had said , and suspended Phaedra for the rest of the year . Phaedra had said it was plenty for her , too , and chucked education altogether . After that she and Jayell squared off in a serious two-year courtship that had everyone predicting that they would get married or kill each other , when suddenly Jayell broke away and left for Atlanta . He would never say why , or what happened . He just would n't talk about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Phaedra was now working at Nelson 's Florist shop and singing Saturday nights with the Graniteers at the dances in Taylorsville . " Take it easy on the tin , " said Jayell , " he gets to keep that . " I was on the roof of the Boggses ' barn with a crowbar , making more noise than progress , while Jayell carefully pried off the weathered siding . The sun was hot despite the breeze , and before long the tin was burning through my tennis shoes . The barn was down near the woods . Jayell had come in the back road to avoid the house , but I knew it was only a matter of time . " What the damn hell are you doing ? "  | Jayell dropped his crowbar and turned around , and there she stood , in skin-tight cut-off jeans and a white blouse knotted below her breasts . " What the damn hell does it look like , " said Jayell , retrieving his bar . " I 'm tearing down this barn . " " What for ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lumber . That all right with you ? " She squinted up at me . " You see a gray mama cat up there ? " " Saw one down near the woods awhile ago . " " Probably moving the kittens . Give me a foot up , " she told Jayell . She put a foot in his folded hands and hoisted herself easily through the rafters . After a search of the loft she said , " Yeah , I guess she moved them already . Damn , looks like could have told me . Now I got to find ' em before the dogs do . Help me down . " Jayell reached up for her and lifted her down again and she stood for a moment , her hands resting lightly on his shoulders . Without expression she said , " How you been , Jack ? " " Ca n't complain . " " Got the world 's poor in castles yet ? " Jayell smiled . " Still working on it . " Phaedra nodded and walked back up the hill . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the framing . The little barn was tacked together with country carpentry and came apart with little trouble . In a short time we were laying out the rafters and joists . Phaedra drifted down the hill and sat in the wheelbarrow with a handful of raisins . She sat popping them into her mouth . " What you going to do with that scrap ? " " Build a house . " " Wo n't be much of a house . " Jayell did n't say anything . He climbed in the wall and started knocking out studs . " Tick Weaver asked about you the other day . Said he had n't seen you since you got back . " " How is old Tick ? " " Still pickin ' guitar half the time  --  drunk on his ass the rest . " Jayell laughed and shook his head . " Been meaning to look in on those fellas. "  | " We know , you been  --  tied up . " " Hey " ? Jayell wiped his face with a forearm ? " you suppose you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure . " Phaedra slid out of the wheelbarrow and tugged at her blouse , pulling the cloth tight across her breasts ; a seemingly unconscious movement , except that I knew Phaedra . " If you want something stronger , we 've got a jug in the kitchen . " " No , water 'll be fine . " " You can help me carry the glasses , " she said , lifting a chin at me . I threw down my bar and followed her up the hill . She moved ahead of me in a full Phaedra walk , brown legs stroking , careful of the motion in her shorts . It was intended for Jayell , of course , and it was just as well , since it would have been lost on me anyway . I was watching that house . Phaedra 's mother lived in a hospital bed in the living room , and ruled the house with a chart and a bell . The boys who dated Phaedra never went into the house , and the few who had seen her mother in recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew about her illness was Dr. Breisner 's comment to Miss Esther that it was a rare skin and muscle disease . There were many terrible things about it , he said , and probably the worst was that you could have it and live a long time . I followed Phaedra through the Boggses ' back porch , a screened-in jungle crammed with every kind of vegetation from the surrounding woods , with only a narrow pathway to the kitchen between sprouting pots and cans and curtains of vines swinging from homemade trellises . Phaedra took an ice tray from the refrigerator and ran it under the spigot . " What 's she like ? " " What 's who like ? " " Keep your voice down . Look , sport , I did n't get you up here to play games . You know who  --  that bitch from Atlanta . " " Well , she 's kind of  --  different . " " In what way ? " " It 's kind of hard to say . . . " " Well , come on ! Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will you . I do n't know . The best I can say ? she 's from Atlanta  --  but just lately . You know what I mean ? " " Holy Je-sus . " Phaedra said in disgust .  | " No , wait . Big city , but still . . . well , let me put it this way ? she 's a brass cracker . You know what I mean ? " Phaedra nodded . She threw up her hands . " She 's a brass cracker . Hand me those glasses . " She moved to the window and flicked aside the curtain . " You think he loves her ? " " Yes , " I said , without hesitation , " that I can say for sure . He loves her . " I had n't meant to be cruel , but only to give it straight and quick when I was asked , as I knew from the start the question was coming . But when she turned and looked at me , there was not the jealousy or anger that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was in her face was completely un-Phaedralike ; a sudden softening , a flash of warmth that was totally unconscious , surprise-fixed before she caught herself and the features hardened again . " Well , " she said , " I hope the little bastard gets what he deserves . " I reached in the cupboard for the glasses , but my fingers were sweaty and one of them slipped . I grabbed for it and knocked it into some jars on the sideboard . There was an immediate response from the living room . " What 's that ! Phaedra ? That you back there ? " " You idiot ! " Phaedra snapped . " Phaedra ! I hear  --  you got somebody back there with you ? Who 've you brought in this house ? You better answer me ! " Phaedra was shoving me toward the door . " Get out , get out ! Go ! " I needed no encouragement . I thrashed my way through the back porch greenery and the screen door and sprinted off down the hill . Jayell was loading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at me in surprise . " What 's wrong with you ? Where 's the water ? " " I , uh , did n't get it . You ready to go ? " " Did n't get it ? You were gone long enough to dig a well ! What 's the matter , the old lady get after you ? " " Let 's get out of here , " I said . " We had no business coming here . " Jayell looked up toward the house , to the shadow standing amid the sprawling green of the porch . " Yeah , " he said , " I guess you 're right . " And he started the truck and pulled slowly up the hill , watching to sec that the lumber settled and was going to ride .  | WHEN THE POLLARD COUNTY FAIR OPENED IN NOVEMBER , EM AND I were ready ; we had saved our money for weeks . For entertainment , Quarrytown was about as well off as most small towns . There was the Tower Theater and traveling shows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " science show " set up in a vacant lot by a man who stood on the tailgate of a pickup and did tricks with chemicals , then mixed up bread with a liquid he said was stomach acid , and blew up a balloon with it to show how his indigestion medicine worked ; and there was a hypnotist who tried to put a man to sleep in the department-store window by chanting over the radio , but the crowd kept tapping on the glass with coins and waking the subject up . And , of course , there were the preachers ; one , an ex-convict who sermonized through a cell door welded into the back of his van , was so popular because of his tirades against young people that he was held over to speak at the school assembly on Monday . But without his cell door he was just a pitiful old tramp up on the stage , ill at case , jumping every time the hall hell went off .  | So when the fair came to town , everybody turned out . Em was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gypsy . He considered her more professional than Madame Edith out on the highway , whom he suspected was nine-tenths Italian . Em and I rode the ferris wheel , knocked over some milk bottles , and threw some darts , and winning nothing , splurged on more rides and then wandered through the livestock barn . We had no interest in livestock , but it was free . Em got some cotton candy and I ate a couple of hot dogs , despite Em 's warning that a carnival was no place to be eating meat . We wandered down the midway and watched a sharpshooter , a tall cowboy in charcoal gray pants and a pink shirt , popping balloons around a lady on a spinning board . Then Em spied the fortune teller 's tent . He hustled me toward the shooting gallery . " Here , boy , " he said , stuffing a dollar bill in my pocket , " shoot slow and make it last . " I did , taking my time choosing a rifle and remembering to count my change between each round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty times and scored eighteen hits . I put down the rifle greatly pleased with myself . The man in the booth shoved a bonehandled pocketknife at me and told me for Christ 's sake to go away . One of the blades was broken but he would n't listen . As I was walking away , a voice spoke from between the tents bordering the gallery . " Not bad shootin ' pardner , not bad a'tall . " I turned , and there in the darkness stood the sharpshooter , his pink shirt glowing like neon . He pushed back his hat and smiled . " Those sights are bent , you know . " " I know , " I said . " After the first couple of shots I allowed for that . " " Well , you know about guns , do you , sport ? " " Not much , but I 'm learning . Someday I 'll have a hundred of ' em . I saw you with that lady back there . " " Yeah ? What you think of that shootin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cowboy laughed . " Once in a while , but she always recovers . " He patted me on the shoulder and his hand smelled sweet . He left it there , massaging while he talked . " You talk about rifles now , I 've got a collection that 'd knock your eye out ! Worth upwards of twenty thousand dollars . "  | " Yeah ? " " Got this big elephant gun I 've been offered five thousand cash for , inlaid with pure silver , once belonged to the king of Belgium . ' Course , pistols I got all over the place . Got ' em with barrels that long , two little derringers you could hide in a baby 's hand . Say , you know , my trailer 's just back over there , how 'd you like to step back and have a look . . . " Then he stopped and shook his head . " But I guess we could n't do that . Your folks 'd be wonderin ' where you was . " " Oh , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he 's gettin ' the five-dollar reading . " " Yeah ? " The cowboy glanced about . " Well , tell you what , you know I 've got this little rifle , sweetest shootin ' little .22 you ever saw , no real use to me , I took it on a trade , and I 'll bet a boy like you could really take to a gun like that . " As he talked he gently pulled me into the shadow . We moved toward the rear of the tents . " H'yeaaahh-Noww . . . The cowboy released me and whirled around . Em stood silhouetted against the flashing midway , his head near the top of the tents . He stepped over the ropes and the sharpshooter backed into the side of the tent . The Indian moved close and looked down on him , the multicolored lights throwing unearthly strains of light across his face . The man tensed and made a sound in his throat . " What 's goin ' on here ? " rumbled Jojohn . The cowboy pressed tighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he whispered softly . They stood looking at each other . Suddenly Em became ill at ease , a little embarrassed . He moved back and tossed his head . " Go , get out of here . " " I did n't mean no harm . " " Just get out of here . " The cowboy took a step , hesitated , then turned and walked away quickly , his boots swishing through the tall grass as he disappeared in the carnival night . " What 'd you go and do that for ? " I said . " You just stay in the light and do n't go wanderin ' off . " " He was only going to show me his gun collection ! What 'd you run him off for ? "  | " Tell you all about it sometime . Hey , you want to ride that loop thing again ? " " Tell me about what ? " " You ai n't all clear on the regular kind yet . Ai n't sump'n you wanta learn about back'ards . How about the scrambler ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to ride the scrambler . " " Wanta see the geek eat a live chicken ? " " No , sir . " " How about the exhibits  --  the old lady 's got some canned stuff entered . " " Aw , come on , Em . . . " " Well , what you come to a fair for if you ai n't gon na do nothin ' ? " " I want you to tell me about that man , and why you acted that way . " So , Em told me . Seeing that I was not to be budged , he pulled me off to the side , and there on the edge of the midway , with its whirling music and flashing colored lights , Em created another unreal world for me . At first I could n't believe it , and dogged him with questions . He answered as best he could , describing what he knew in minute detail , and he described this horror with a strange compassion . " I do n't know the whys of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like anybody else that 's different , it 's hardest of all on them . ' Course , anybody messes with a child of either sex deserves to get his head busted in . " " Then why did n't you ? " I said , still shaking , unable to shake the picture in my mind . " Why did n't you kill him ! " Em thought about it ; shook his head . " I do n't know . It 's funny , I can hit a mannish woman without no trouble , but I never could hit a womanish man . " Em studied me closely . " Anyhow , you got it all straight now ? " I nodded . I did n't feel like talking . " Good boy . Now , tell you what , you go give the hobby horses a turn , whilst I make one more stop  --  then we 'll go . " Em had spied the South Sea Islands Revue . " You go ahead , " I sighed . " I 'll just wait here . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around quickly . " You go in the exhibit barn . You 'll be safe there . Just stay with the local folks and look over the booths . It 'll be educational . " He pushed me toward the  | DAIRY PRODUCTS booth and struck out for the tent where heavy women in grass skirts had just finished sashaying around to the phonograph and were filing through the flap . I hung around RURAL ELECTRIFICATION and THE QUARRIES OF POLLARD COUNTY as long as I could , then wandered out onto the midway again . But the fair was ruined , out of kilter ; the people who ran the rides looked dirty , the music was too loud , straining at artificial excitement . There was peeling paint and weariness , grotesqueness in the canvas signs of " The Python Girl " and " Oscar , the Dog-Faced Boy , " sadness in black boys pitching hard-earned pennies in dishes to win dollars , in grown people with serious faces studying kernels of corn on bingo cards . . . " under the N , three . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clambered noisily on their backs , waiting to plod ahead in the path their hooves had worn bare in the grass . A thousand miles in a thousand towns , a mindless trek in thirty-foot circles of infinity . Em was wrong , I told myself . I knew all about sex . I had heard the jokes , seen the little books stolen from fathers ' dressers , overheard the barbershop talk . But it was always between a man and a woman . The business about the cowboy just did n't fit , threw the whole system off . There was so much I did n't know , and no answer that ever seemed final . The music built in the girlie tent , accompanied by bursts of applause and laughter and Em 's unmistakable cries . Eventually , a crescendo , with pulsating drums and crashing cymbals . Then , as it reached its climax , there was a loud scream from one of the girls , and a commotion inside the tent . A moment later Em came through the flap , propelled by two policemen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangling from the other . " Wait now , gentlemen , do n't get anxious now . . . " Expelled through the gate , he ran back to the fence for a few indignant words at the policemen . Finally he turned and saw me . " Oh , there you are . " Then he frowned , remembering . " Thought I told you to wait at the exhibit barn . " I handed him his fallen hat . " A lot of good it would have done me , with you out here . " " Oh , yeah . Well ! " He clapped on his hat and held out the cotton candy . " Want some ? "  | " No , " I said , " let 's go . " Out on the highway , cars were bumper to bumper as the secondshift people headed for the fair . " Man , them gals was sump'n . " Em looked at me in the glow of headlights . " You all right ? You do n't look so good . " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Could see the whole town from up there ! " We walked in silence for a while . " See what I got ? " Em twisted the G-string to make it sparkle . " That big blonde . . . " I stopped , fighting the sickening swells . " What 's the matter , boy ? " Em grabbed my arm and the cotton candy waved close to my face , glowing pink , thickly sweet . I lurched away and vomited beside the road . Em took his boots out of danger and sat on the bank until I finished . He sadly shook his head . " Told you them hot dogs was tainted . " As we came down the road toward the gulley , Tio was sitting in the darkness on Teague 's front step . " How was the fair ? " he said . " Same old thing , " I said . " Did n't you go ? " I asked , even though I knew he had n't . Things were getting worse by the day at the store . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shoot , " he said , bringing out frozen Pepsis , " I got better things to waste my money on . " " One thing about a fair , " Em said , " every year they get new gals . " " They looked pretty old to me , " I said . " That 's ' cause you do n't know nothin ' ' bout it . Ah , that big blonde was sump'n else . " Em struck a match and looked in his wallet . " Two dollars . That 'll do . " He got up and dusted his pants . " You kids play nice and do n't fight , " and he shambled off down the road . " Where 's he off to now ? " said Tio . " Deva 's place , I guess . The carnival gals got him all tore up . Tio , have you ever  --  done it ? " " Done what ? " " You know , with a girl . " " Oh , hundreds of times . " " Yeh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " How come I must have seen it done ? " " Well , you know , they say black people do it a lot . " " Not around me they do n't . How about you ? " " Now , who 's going to be doing it at the boardinghouse ! " " Yeah , I see what you mean . " Tio chuckled . " I 'll bet you could see it down at Deva 's place . Bet they 're doing it right out in the yard ! " " You ever been down there ? " " Just once . One Halloween night me and Skeeter and Carlos slipped down and spread a bucket of fish under the house . Hoooby the time they found ' em you could smell that place two blocks away ! " " Wish you would n't talk about that , " I said . " What 's the matter ? " " Ate some bad hot dogs at the fair . " I swigged on the Pepsi . " Look , " I said , " let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look . " " You mean it ? " " Damn right ! We been ignorant long enough . Here I done messed around pickin ' up bits and pieces , and before I can get it all straight , things are startin ' to run backwards . I 've heard the talk and seen the pictures , now I 'm gon na see it myself and get it clear . " Up to that time I myself had never ventured closer to Deva 's than the corner , when I followed Em down one night . It was in the most notorious section of the Ape Yard , and the fights and carryings on were legend . But it was the only whorehouse in town where Em was welcome . A group of white women plied an informal trade at the Gibbs Hotel , but Em had n't been allowed in there since the night he got drunk and tore up the lobby and three paying customers . Besides , Em was a bit shabby , even for the Gibbs , and he was dark enough to make the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable at Deva 's , and there was a big black woman named Mae who wore a red wig and had n't any shame at all ! Once in the cindered alley beside the two-story house , we set about plotting the best way to get in . The front parlor was full of people , but they were n't doing anything but sitting and drinking and talking . " What 's goin ' on is goin ' on up there , " said Tio , pointing to the second-floor windows . " Maybe we could slip in the back door . "  | Tio opened it and peeked in , then put his fingers to his lips and motioned me back outside . " People in the hall , " he said . He thought he could climb the vines up the back porch , but they were rotten and he fell in the yard with both hands full of brittle stems and dead flowers . He was ready to call it quits . " I ai n't bustin ' my back breakin ' in no whorehouse . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You got to try something else . " " What you mean I got to try ? I do n't see you doin ' no tryin ' ! You 're the one wantin ' to see it in the first place . I 've seen dogs do it ; that convinces me . You 're the one wantin ' all the facts ; seem like to me you ought to be the one doin ' some climbin ' ! " Tio pulled himself sullenly on a parked fender . " Git somebody killed ! " As we sat and thought about it a knife fight broke out across the street and men in bloody shirts were chasing one another up the road . The people in Deva 's place piled out onto the front porch and milled in the yard . Tio jumped down off the car . " Now 's our chance ! " We ran to the back door and into the hall and tiptoed up the stairs . The house was surprisingly similar to Miss Esther 's . There was a single bulb burning at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there a door opened down the hall . We made ourselves small behind a chifforobe . A young woman came out and led a man down the stairs . We stopped at a couple of doors and listened , but heard nothing . Then we heard noises from the end of the hall . Tio looked at me and nodded . We crept to the door and listened , and knew we had found what we were looking for . That bed was in a lot of pain . Tio slowly turned the knob and was easing the door open when a voice behind us boomed like a cannon . " Whut is dis ! " She was enormous , a heavy-jowled black woman in a tent of shimmering yellow . I could n't get over the size of that dress , and bright to hurt your eyes . Tio was the first to recover . " Hey , Miss Deva , " he said , striking a broad grin . " What the very  --  how 'd you all get in here ! " Tio stayed cool . Hooking thumbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' around . Say , uh , you would n't have anything our size , would you ? " " I 'll give you sump'n yo ' size ! " And next I knew she had us both by the collar and we were being carried down the stairs , our toes barely touching the carpet . When we reached the kitchen she plunked  | us in chairs and took a seat at the head of the table . Propping her heavy elbows on the oilcloth she aimed a finger at Tio . " Right now , mister , whut 's this all about ? And gim me that much sass and I 'll jerk a knot in yo ' tail . " Tio swallowed . " Well , " he said , glancing at me , " we were just looking . . . " " Looking for Jojohn , " I blurted out . " Who ? " Deva jangled her plastic bracelets and leaned closer . " Lookin ' for who ? " " Jojohn . Em Jojohn . " " Big Em ? The Indian ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't here , so . . . " I was interrupted by a man in a pin-striped suit rushing into the kitchen . He leaned down and whispered something in Deva 's ear . Her face changed to sudden alarm . She said something quickly and the man nodded and left . " You two do n't budge , " she said , and she was up and gone . Tio and I looked at each other and started to ease up from the table , but the cook racked a boiling kettle to the edge of the stove and shook her head . " You heard what Miss Deva said . " We sat back down . " Fine mess , " Tio said , " just fine . " A moment later Deva returned , followed by Em Jojohn . " Come on , " he said , " move . " " Em , we did n't mean to cause no trouble . . . " " No time . No time . Trouble comin ' ? move ! " He jerked us up from the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the yard a pair of headlights swung in from the street . Em dived , and the three of us went over the low wall as the headlights washed the yard . " Lay flat and do n't make a sound , " he said . The car killed its lights and slid to a stop among the other parked cars . Instantly , those milling about disappeared . The yard was deserted and quiet . Wherever that dark green Continental went in the Ape Yard it trailed a wake of silence . It announced the presence of " Doc " Harley Bobo . Doc Bobo was the town 's black undertaker , and one of the wealthiest and most powerful men , black or white , in Pollard County . In addition to the cotton mill , he owned almost all of the residential  | property in the Ape Yard , plus the Starlite Cafe and the other four shops and taverns clustered at the foot of the hill below Mr. Teague 's in the place called Cabbage Alley . It was rumored that Doc Bobo also had money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an insurance agency and a used-car lot that catered heavily to black trade . It was said that no business was conducted in the Ape Yard without Doc Bobo being involved somewhere in the transaction . Hit-and-run solicitors such as home-improvement outfits , lawn-furniture salesmen , and itinerant peddlers of books , kitchenware and mail-order clothes , who normally do well in black communities , all found doors closed to them until they got directed to the two-story white funeral home with the blue neon clock sign set back behind the willows and magnolias on a spacious , well-kept lawn on Oglethorpe Street . Then , if they met with Doc Bobo 's approval , one of his men went out to ride with them as they made calls , and they did a booming business . During the war Doc Bobo was the source of supply for anything on the black market , and when the county went dry , Doc became the most reliable purveyor of quality moonshine . Most of his operations were thought to be confined to the Ape Yard , but when a hotcar ring that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken , it was traced to a garage on the Little Iron River . Thirteen blacks were arrested and the case was closed . Some of the families got monthly checks . Local officials saw no reason to get involved . Doc Bobo was highly respected among influential whites . He often boasted that Pollard County had the highest level of registered black voters in the state , and it was understood that the political faction doing business with Bobo got a bloc of several thousand extra voters standing hat in hand on election day . It was Doc Bobo who was photographed with the governor breaking ground for the new Negro school ; who bustled into the school auditorium the night of the Community Chest drive , gold tooth agleam , bearing the buckets of coins that represented the Ape Yard 's contribution ; and who gave soothing talks to the civic clubs . Cruising the streets in his dark green limousine , his diamonds glinting in the sun , Doc Bobo was a calming influence to the town 's white people . The law was n't needed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " dog boys " were on patrol . If a crime was committed anywhere of which a black man was suspected , the sheriff  | simply picked up the phone . The next day a black man was in jail . Or dead . To those blacks on the raw underside of that calm , he was not a man but a force , a presence as awesome as evil itself . The door of Doc Bobo 's green Continental opened and the splendidly built black giant , Clyde Fay , stepped out , tugged his cap down to his Roman nose , and moved across the yard to the shadows of the house with the flowing grace of a dancer , which he was said to have been at one time . Presently another car came down the road and turned in at Deva 's , a battered Plymouth with fins and a torn and squeaking fender . Several black men got out laughing and talking among themselves , quarry ledgehands , judging from their leather caps and dusty overalls . One of them carried a large paper sack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sharp blast from the Continental  --  and they stopped . A shadow was moving along the house ; it stopped between them and the door . The door opened momentarily and Clyde I y was framed in the square . The men saw him and froze . The door quickly closed again . The men dropped back and began moving away , all but the one with the sack . The man left facing Fay began shaking like a terrified child , whining . He started backing away . He backed into the grille of the Continental and stopped . He was murmuring something , pleading . Fay moved toward him , slowly , and as he drew closer the other man suddenly cried out and snatched something from the bag . A bottle of beer whirled past Fay 's head and crashed against the wall . The man broke right , but with a single bound Fay was in front of him again . The man dodged again , and again , and each time Fay cut him off . In panic the man threw another bottle , missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar ' appened : the Continental 's lights came on ! They shone directly in Fay 's face , blinding him . Then I heard laughter from the limousine . Doc Bobo was playing a game . Fay 's lips spread in a wide grin , and as the bottles shot at him from the darkness he continued to dodge them with no more than a swift movement of a shoulder , a flick of the head . Cursing hoarsely , the man hurled bottle after bottle , each time the bottles missing their mark and bursting and foaming down the wall . When the bag was  | emptied the man screamed and broke to run , but instantly Fay was on him . He threw him against the house and went to work . The house and the street were deathly quiet ; in trancelike horror I listened to the man 's back thumping against the boards with each precisioned blow that Fay , standing straight , delivered to his middle . Each strike was slow and measured , and it seemed Fay would never stop . Offering no resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emitting tiny squeaking noises like a rubber doll when it 's squeezed , enduring it more like a necessary operation than the wanton brutality that it was . And it was that , the acceptance of it , that was most horrible of all . When the man started to vomit blood Fay stepped away and delivered a final blow to his temple that sent him spinning to the ground . Fay stopped to examine his sleeves in the headlights before getting into the car . He started the engine and the Continental pulled out of the yard . The only movement was from the crumpled pile of overalls on the ground by the chimney , where the dying man lay drawing his knees up in agony . And only a glimpse of that , for I was being lifted bodily in the air , and with Tio under one arm and me under the other , Em Jojohn was pounding across the stubble field toward home .  | By THE FIRST OF MARCH THE HOUSE IN MARBLE PARK WAS finished , a fact that was obvious to everyone , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the older shop boys on the premises from dawn to dark , and expected the rest of us to keep coming directly from school , although there was little to do but tap and scrape , carry bits of lumber from here to there , and try to look busy enough not to get yelled at . When Jayell did turn up a bit of real work , we fell on it like a pack of terriers after a rat . The Hendersons next door , who at first looked with suspicion on the crew of black boys , gradually fell into the spirit of the surprise for Gwen , and the spirit Jayell always seemed to create around anything he was building , and eventually they began supplying us with cookies and iced tea . They were now asking daily if Jayell was ready for Gwen to see the place yet . They wanted to have a house-warming party . Thelma Martin from down the street was bursting with excitement . She and the other teachers were planning showers . Still Jayell roamed and fretted , touching up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred things wrong , cursing himself for sloppiness . Under that galling pettiness , plus the double pressures I was under at home and at school , I began to lose patience . Em quit outright , and before long even the shop boys began making excuses . Finally Jayell was left alone on the job , fuming , puttering , ranting to himself . The house stood framed among the trees like a threedimensional painting , bright and strong and beautiful , waiting for its creator to give it up . And he kept trying , and could n't . If Gwen was suffering any anxiety about her future home during that time , she did n't have time to show it . She was preoccupied trying to figure out , and explain to the principal , Mr. Guest , why , since the institution of her model court system in civics , our classroom had degenerated into the rowdiest and most undisciplined in the school . It had started out well enough , an imaginative innovation in the teaching of government , Mr. Guest had said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtroom Gwen was the judge , with student attorneys and police appointed by her , and the rest of the class filled out the juries and provided the criminal element . A person could be charged with cheating , shooting spitballs , passing notes , talking , or any number of other offenses listed in the Class Statutes on the bulletin board . She appointed me a lawyer , which scared me to death at first , but after that first halting presentation before a jury , which , to my amazement , returned a verdict in my favor , I quickly began to gain confidence . It turned out there was no real trick to winning cases in our court ; it was hard to produce actual witnesses to cheating or spitball shooting , because during tests the " witnesses " were pretty well occupied in concentrating , or cheating , themselves , and a veteran spitball shooter could get off a shot with one hand from under a desk with a fairly high degree of accuracy . Also , after the first week or so in our small democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain a few grateful criminals I had defended in the past . Our court had a ring of authenticity to it , too , which also worked to the defendant 's advantage , in that the most damning evidence never carried as much weight as a good show . Despite her position on the bench , Gwen could bring charges too , and her cases were the most ticklish to handle , but to our surprise , no one was more delighted than she was when a defendant was acquitted that she knew for a fact was guilty ! This was American  | jurisprudence at its best , she said ; it proved that everyone had an equal chance under the law , whether he was guilty or not . To us lawyers and criminals this was only right and proper , but it brought Nancy Buckhorn , the Methodist minister 's daughter and our class prosecutor , close to tears . She and Gwen had to have several consultations . Time after time Gwen demonstrated her complete and absolute faith in the system ; she stuck to her guns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even when it became obvious that things were getting out of hand . As for the class , we were convinced that self-government was a wonderful thing indeed . By the approach of spring we were doing anything we wanted in class ; cheating was rampant , spitballs and erasers showered the air , and students wandered in and out of class at will . I enjoyed the respect of my classmates that I had never had before , policemen were getting extra desserts at lunch , and it was virtually impossible to convict anyone on any charge whatsoever : all in all we were enjoying about as corrupt and lawless a society as could be imagined anywhere . Swish . The sound came from somewhere behind me , beyond the hedge . I paid little attention to it , and went back to sipping iced tea and reading my Captain Marvel . It was Saturday , and one of the first days of reliable warmth . Spring in Quarrytown , that high in the foothills , was always an uncertain thing . The sun had been standing out brightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when school let out , those who broke for the buses with their coats under their arms and sweaters knotted around their waists were likely as not soon wearing them on their shivering backs . But that day it was warm . Down the road , Wash Fuller 's martin gourds hung motionless in the sky , disturbed only by the intermittent landings and departings of martins busily bringing straws for their nests . Wash 's dog , Jincey , could sleep quietly at the step without having to move around the corner every time the wind shifted . It was quiet in the yard . Insects worked in the scuppernong arbor and buzzed among the fruit trees , and beyond , to the left of the house , old Aaron Tim clucked softly to his brown , bony-shouldered mule as they broke ground for Mrs. Bell 's garden .  | It was decidedly spring . I began to drowse and the print started running together . Then , from over the hedge there came a light slap , as of someone swatting an insect , followed by another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the hammock . Mr. Woodall often sunned himself there as soon as the weather permitted , but I knew he was inside listening to a ball game . You could hear the radio a block away . " Damnit ! " There was an angrier slap , a rustle of the hammock , and Gwen came around the hedge , dressed in white short shorts and a halter . " Oh . . . well , hello ! " She watched me a moment , tucking in the ends of a towel she had wound into a turban . " I did n't know anyone was back here . " " I . . . I was just sitting here , reading . " I felt the need to explain somehow , about being there . She had that look in her face . A slow smile spread over her face . " It 's all right , " she said . " I 'm flattered . " " Huh ? " " Do n't be ashamed , Earl , it 's perfectly normal at your age . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , standing so close I was aware of the tiny beads of perspiration on her long , shapely legs . " Back to your old habits , I see . Does n't your aunt care about your reading those things ? " " Not when they do n't cost anything . I traded this one off Fred Wygart , who gets ' em free at his daddy 's drugstore . " She sat down beside me and took a cigarette from a blue case and lit it with a matching lighter . " I do n't know why I keep trying , I really do n't . I beat my brains out , and **26;27;TOOLONG ! " " I 'm sorry . " " Ah , I 'm just upset about that civics class thing , I guess . I had another conference with Mr. Guest yesterday , and as of Monday , our court is permanently adjourned and I 'm back to teaching the Constitution . . . the Bill of Rights . . . de-dah , de-dah , dedah . . . " " Oh , that 's too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon . Maybe next year will be better . There 's one happy note , at least . Thelma Martin 's just discovered she 's pregnant and she 's arranged for me to take over as drama coach next year . Thank God and George Martin for that ! " She turned and looked at me , blinking her eyes slowly , thinking .  | " I ca n't act , " I said quickly . " I could n't even remember the lines ! Miss Esther sends me to the store for two things , she 's got to write ' em down , and , and clumsy ? I ca n't even walk across a room without knocking things over . . . " " Oh , stop it , Earl . What 's the matter with you anyway ? You have got to be the strangest kid I have ever come across . It 's like pulling teeth to draw you out of yourself , and yet when I forced you into that lawyer part , you came on like gangbusters ! You 've got to learn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're never going to have any friends . " " I 've got friends , " I said . " Well , I 've never seen them . You skulk around that school like you 're afraid somebody 's going to say boo ' to you . Do n't you have any special friends you hang around with ? " " Sure , there 's Em , Tio , the shop boys . . . " " Not these colored people , for heaven 's sake . I mean white friends , outside of this  --  niggertown . You 've gone to school all these years , surely you 've developed a few white friends along the way . " " Yeah , but when school let out they went uptown and I came back to the Ape Yard . " " But there must have been class parties , little dances and hayrides and things . " It was hard to explain . " Oh , sure but , well , they all knew each other , they went to church together , they invited each other to join clubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they did n't know my folks , and when I came around it was always said , oh . ' Not good  --  not bad , just , oh . ' I guess I just got tired of that oh . ' " " Well , you ca n't bury yourself down here for the rest of your life , even Jayell has finally realized that . At some time , you 've got to come to terms with the real world . " In that moment , for the first time , I think I got an inkling of what was in Gwen 's mind , of the way she saw things . " This , " I said , waving a hand toward the Ape Yard , " this is not real to you ? " She thought about it a moment , and laughed . " You know , now that you mention it , the whole place does have an unreal quality about it : look at your aunt , prodding those old people around like she 's going to make them live a hundred years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patching up and slapping paint on that run-down grocery store as though they 're going to turn it into  | a supermarket , and Jayell , creating those splendid little houses  --  for trash to live in ! Even that horrible Indian you tag around after , undoubtedly the most grotesque , worthless caricature of a human being that ever drew breath , and he acts as if he were king of the world ! I swear , not one of them has even the faintest grip on reality ! Maybe the heat in this depressing hollow and  --  and the awful fumes from that quarry , do something to the brain after a while . At least there 's hope for Jayell , if I can get him out of here in time . And you too , Earl , if you get out of here , and with the right kind of people . " " But I like the people down here . Tio 's brighter than I am , at least he makes better grades , and Em  --  well , he 's free and independent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and somebody tried to hurt you , he 'd kill ' em , without even thinking about it . Have you got a better friend than that ? " " Earl , you 're fantasizing again  --  and that 's exactly what I 'm talking about . Listen to me , very shortly you 'll be leaving all this . Nature forces change , whether we want it or not . You 're growing up now , soon you 'll want to move out of this hollow and start a life of your own , meet a girl . . . how about that , " she asked , turning to me , " have n't you begun to notice any changes lately ? " I did n't say anything . She took the towel from her hair and ran it down her legs , wiping off the perspiration . " How about girls , Earl ? Surely there 's some little girl at school you 've taken a shine to by now . " " No . " " Oh , come on , you have begun to notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 've had such a strange upbringing , it would n't surprise me if . . . you do know about sex , do n't you ? " " Oh , back'ards and forwards ! " " Thank you . " " Huh ? " " My legs , " she said , smiling , " you were staring at them . " " Oh , no , ma'am ! I . . . I was just . . . " " And you were watching me through the hedge , were n't you ? " I rolled the comic book and set my chin on it . Her voice was firm . " Now listen to me , Earl , there 's nothing wrong with a healthy interest in sex , but there 's a great deal wrong with not being honest , with me , and with yourself . Now , you were looking at me , were n't you ? "  | I closed my eyes and nodded . " There . And for being honest , and for the compliment to me , I thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lord , would you be a case study for Dr. Fenworth ! He was my professor in Early Childhood Development . " Suddenly she stubbed out her cigarette and got to her knees and faced me . " Tell me , what sports do you like . Football ? Baseball ? Basketball ? " I shook my head to each of them . " Do n't you like sports at all ? " " I like swimming  --  and Tio and I wrestle a lot . " " Oh , reea-ally ! " She studied me closely . " Do you ever . . . ah , dream about girls ? " " Not especially . " " Let 's analyze some of your dreams . Quick , what did you dream last night ? " " I do n't remember . " " Ah , hah . Earl , I ca n't help you if you wo n't cooperate . Now , I want you to think carefully before you answer  --  and trust me . Do you ever dream about boys ? " " Oh , sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our noses almost touching . " And what boy do you dream about most ? " " Tio , I guess . " She straightened . " Oh , my God ! " Taking a moment to compose herself , she set her jaw and said . " Earl , look at my breast ! " And to my utter disbelief , she yanked down her halter top . I broke out in a clammy sweat . She waited . I checked the clouds . " Earl , you 've got to try ! Look at my breast ! " " Uh , which one ? " " My God you ca n't even  --  the left one , then , the left one ! Look at it ! " I slowly lowered my eyes . " Quick , " she panted , " what are you thinking ? " " Miss Esther . . . " " Ah , hah ! " " If she caught me at this she 'd skin me alive . I 've got to go . "  | She pulled up her halter and placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems , Earl . I tell you what , why do n't you and I go on a picnic . " " Do what ? " " Just the two of us , we 'll go down to the lake and just sit under the trees and talk . I 've got this book . . . " As I was debating between faking a stroke and making an all-out break for the hedges , the sweet music of salvation touched my ear , the ragged piston bang of Jayell Crooms 's pickup . Right away I knew something was up . The truck bed was filled with grinning shop boys . Jojohn waved from the cab . Jayell got out and came limping across the lawn in a new sports coat and tie , stitching with nerves . " Come on , " he said , " get in the truck . " " What 's all this ? " " I 'll show you . Come on . " " But should n't I at least get dressed first ? " " Never mind , " said Jayell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawling in the back with the others . They hoisted me over the side . " What 's he want all of us along for ? " I asked . " Must be scared to go it alone , " Em said . " Well , I hope she likes it , " said Skeeter . " I ai n't goin ' through that again ! " We drove out to Marble Park and up past the postage-stamp lawns , heads lifting from putters , from car washings and mowings , Gwen watching but not saying anything , fighting to control her hair . Jayell turned up the final hill and stopped before the house . It was beautiful , framed there under the trees . Clean , massively built , but light as a song . We waited as Gwen got out and walked around the hood and stood looking at it . " I came up here at sunrise , " Jayell said , " and when I looked at it , I knew I 'd done something special . I just walked around and around it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh , and each time it looked new to me . Crazy . " He looked at me and grinned . " Not sleeping and eating right , I guess . It 's simple , not like anything I 've done before  --  but I 've never built anything better . That 's me , with love . Boy , you think I 'm crazy ? " " Everybody says so . " Jayell laughed . " Let 's show her inside . "  | Gwen moved into the house stiffly , hesitantly . She stopped in the high-ceilinged living room and slid her hand over the marble mantlepiece . " It 's beautiful , Jayell , " she said , " perfectly beautiful . " But was she just complimenting him ? There is a feeling you have when something is shared , a feeling that does n't need bright smiles and glittering eyes . As yet , that feeling was n't there . " We carried them fireplace stones from the Mahew plantation , " said Skeeter eagerly , " but there 's two ton of rock in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Carlos , standing behind the brassstudded easy chair . " That 's real leather , you know , ai n't no vinyl . " She sat in the chair , and sprang out with a laugh when it rocked . " I 'm not ready for the knitting-needles bit yet , Carlos . " " That door 's solid oak , " said little Jackie James , " talk about a bother to hang ! But , look here , moves like a feather . . . " " Boys . . . " said Jayell . So we hushed , and followed her through the house , past the effort screaming to be noticed , the thousand small perfections hidden in simplicity , our teeth raw with wanting to speak , eagerly watching her face . She liked the spacious kitchen , the abundance of cabinets . Perhaps they could hire somebody until she learned to cook . She was as terrible a cook as her mother . We trooped up the carpeted stairs , past the hand-rubbed miles of paneling . Skeeter dragged a rag along his brightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its miniature furniture , done in blue , but teased Jayell that her family ran to girls . I stood by the crib admiring the dowels in the railings . A pure misery drilling those holes to equal depths . In the guest room even Jayell could n't resist . He stamped the board planking of the floor , " That 's real wooden pegs in there , you know . You do n't see that anymore . " " Jayell , " she said , " I just ca n't believe it . It 's like a dream . . . like a dream . " She was turning , really looking now , as if gradually recovering from shock . " The colors , everything , it 's like you looked inside my head and . . . " " Wait , " said Jayell nervously , " wait a minute . " And he pushed open the door to the master bedroom . Gwen entered the room softly , her shoulders close , like a little girl . If the rest of the house was wrought with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this room was Jayell 's masterpiece .  | Gwen stood taking it all in , the gleaming mahogany , the dark beams soaring over the thick , luxurious carpet , the delicate ivory handles and elegant curving mirrors , the paintings , the drapes . It was Gwen , even I could see that , as much of her in line , in tone , in texture as can be said of a person in inanimate things . It sparkled around her , the love , the effort , the backbreaking devotion that only Jayell could give so completely , and not leave a trace of himself . She rested a hand on the post of the canopied bed and turned to look at him , her eyes moist , the sunlight striking gold in her hair . A little electric pulse ran through the crowd in the hall . We were turning , grinning at each other . Jojohn slapped his hands . I wanted to shout ! I could have grabbed her and kissed her and danced in the middle of the floor ! Then I caught Jayell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small motion with his head . Carlos nudged us , backing into the hall . He pulled the door to and we tiptoed softly down the stairs .  | THE WEDDING WAS SET FOR THE SEVENTEENTH OF APRIL , AND IT was to be a church wedding . Jayell wanted a quick civil ceremony , but since Gwen and her mother had conceded to his refusal to have the wedding in Atlanta , he felt he had to give in on that point . Gwen 's mother came to town a week prior to the wedding , and after one visit to the boardinghouse , put up at the Marble City Hotel and took her daughter with her . From the time she arrived , Mrs. Burns was completely in charge of the wedding plans . She was a butterfly general , flitting about , spluttering over this , swooping down on that , teary-eyed and always looking at the point of collapse , but always perfectly in command . On her arrival , Jayell disappeared , and stayed gone until the day of the wedding . Gwen 's father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegation of relatives . A tall man with Gwen 's coloring and close-set eyes , he stood about smiling nervously through his hornrimmed glasses , trying to keep out of the way , and looking as though he would like to become part of the furniture until the whole affair  | was over . Seeing his discomfort ; Mr. Rampey and Mr. Burroughs took him around the church for a pass of the bottle and became his constant companions for the duration . Gwen 's younger brother , Larry , a pre-med student at Emory , whom she had insisted be best man , blew into town around noon in a Thunderbird convertible emblazoned with fraternity decals and immediately made it clear that he preferred his own company to anyone else 's . He stood apart twirling the wedding band on his little finger , a ring Gwen had allowed her mother to select in Atlanta , and watched the boarders troop by with a bemused expression as though he were cataloguing a parade of diseases . The little Episcopal church was filled to overflowing . The whole boardinghouse had turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd , but a wedding fetched the lot . Miss Esther brought some of her church friends . Even Mr. Teague dressed up and came . We loaded up the groom 's side of the aisle and the boarders out-cried the blood kin . The Hendersons from Marble Park were there , plus many of Gwen 's friends on the faculty at Quarrytown High , including Thelma Martin and her husband , George . " If somebody 's getting Jayell Crooms to the altar , " he was saying , " I do n't want to miss it . " There was an uncommonly long wait , it seemed to me , in getting the proceedings started . Chafing in the hard collar of a new white shirt , I sat next to a window , which was closed , as they all were , lest a breeze disturb some of Mrs. Burns 's decorations , I suppose . The new sports coat Miss Esther bought me was stiflingly hot , which was n't surprising . It was a hundred percent wool . But it was on sale . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church foyer . Nothing much , a very subdued wandering in and out , and whispering , the way it might be when a theater is afire and they 're trying to decide how best to break it to the people . The minister went out . Then Mrs. Burns . Then a very peculiar thing happened . The church windows began rising and falling . Starting at the rear , on our side , and moving up the length of the church , one after another would rise an inch or two , just enough to let the sunlight shine under the stained glass onto the startled people in the pews , then abruptly drop shut again . When the window beside me went up the mystery was solved . It was Em Jojohn opening them from the outside , in search of me.  | As soon as his bloodshot eyes found me , relief flooded his face . He slapped a finger to his lips and frantically motioned me outside , and slammed down the window with such a loud bang the organist stopped playing . " Said what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others fell to shushing him , but their whisperings only served to confuse him more , until the poor man was in such a state of agitation that Mrs. Bell and Mr. Jurgen had to lead him outside . I seized the opportunity and ducked out the side exit by the choir loft . Jayell 's pickup was outside , all decked out for the honeymoon , and Em beside it , dancing with excitement . Carlos steadied himself drunkenly at the wheel . " What is it ? What 's wrong ? " Em formed his mouth to speak , but stopped , looking over my head , stark terror climbing in his eyes . I looked back , and saw that he had good reason . It was Miss Esther coming down the sidewalk , marching as if to war . She shouldered me aside and hung one of her wrath-of-hell stares on Jojohn . " Two seconds , mister ! " she cried . " It 's old Jaybird , " Em rumbled piteously , " he 's down at Dirsey 's , been there all night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was a very dark thunderhead that built over that brightly lit afternoon sidewalk , darkening us all in its shadow , centered directly over the top of Miss Esther 's head . I was aware of it , and Em rolled his eyes aloft as if he could actually see it . Carlos sat quivering , more sober now than the Episcopal minister . She looked from Em to Carlos . " Are you listening to me ? " They were . " You climb in that truck , you go and get Mr. Jayell Crooms and have him at this church , in his wedding clothes , in twenty minutes flat  --  or **27;55;TOOLONG been born ! " It was not a time to dawdle . Em hit the truck bed in a single bound and I snagged the tailgate and managed to climb aboard as Carlos was clawing away . The frightened boy squalled rubber two blocks up the street before he could get the truck into second gear . We cleared all four wheels on the railroad ramp , landed on the Ape Yard road , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chickens and people , with Em standing at the windshield trying  | to spare what lives he could by shouting them out of the way . Tio saw us coming barely in time to run his fully loaded delivery bike into the creek . Squealing to a momentary halt at the shop , Carlos ducked in and scooped up an armload of the formal wear Jayell had rented and threw it to me on his way back out . Miraculously , the whole outfit was there except for the cuff links , studs and one shoe . We found Jayell leaning precariously on Dirsey 's bar with one leg wrapped around the stool , a glass in one hand , a near-empty bottle in the other , from which he was studiously pouring whiskey on his wrist . The place was littered with empty bottles and full celebrants , sleeping peacefully where they fell . Dirsey patiently wiped a glass . As we burst through the door Jayell turned groggily and pointed with the bottle . " I tole you . . . I ai n't goin ' . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way out , Em 's arms locked around his chest and Carlos carrying his feet . Word apparently had spread , because on the return trip up the hollow , a crowd was ready and waiting . They lined the roads and hills and cheered wildly as the truck came roaring by . Tio , standing beside his dripping bike , held up soaked tatters of what were once bags of groceries and shook them at us as we passed . I could n't hear him , but his lips read : You-gonna-pay-for-this ! Bucketing back over the railroad , Carlos cut hard by the water department , taking the most direct route back to the church , even though it took us straight through the center of town . We shot across Main Street and into the square , scattering people in the crosswalks , with Jayell floundering in the back as Em and I stripped him down and stuffed him into his wedding clothes . " I ca n't do it , Em ! " Jayell sobbed drunkenly , " I ca n't ! " " I know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him clothed down to the missing shoe when Carlos ran up the sidewalk at the church . Miss Esther stood glowering from the steps , fist on her hip , pocketbook in her business hand . " We done it , " said Jojohn proudly , lowering Jayell to where Carlos could steady him . " Keep a hand on him , now . " Jayell blinked about at those around him , his feet groping for moving earth . Miss Esther came and stood before him . " Jayell , I feel like taking a stick of stovewood to you . "  | Jayell got her in focus , and slowly lowered his head . " He 'll start cryin ' again , " warned Em . Gwen 's mother was white . The minister stepped forward . " I 'll explain there has been an unavoidable delay , and we 'll reschedule for tomorrow . " Jayell 's head came up sharply . " What ? " Getting his bearings , he leaned forward , Em and Carlos still clinging , and pointed a finger in the minister 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's today , ai n't it ? These folks came from At-lanta ! To see a wedding ! You ca n't keep Atlanta folks waiting  --  for a wedding ! " He nodded , pleased with himself . He had settled everything . " Oh , my Lord , what shall we do ? " wept Gwen 's mother . Jayell smiled benevolently at her , weaving in his crumpled clothes . " Ma'am , " said Em , removing his hat , " at least today he 's this far , and he 's willin ' . Knowin ' this boy , I would n't take no chance on tomorra . " Jayell nodded again , and wiped his nose with a hanging cuff . Miss Esther sighed and turned to Gwen 's mother . " There 's more'n a grain of truth to that . Seems to me you better go with what you got . " Mrs. Burns consulted briefly with her husband , whose only response was a shrug , and with the minister . Finally she said in a hard voice , one that reminded me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I do n't care . Whatever happens , my daughter deserves it . She deserves it . I tried to tell her . I just thank God we 're not in Atlanta ! " " Amen ! " said Jayell , and pulled away from Carlos to climb the steps . But he had trouble negotiating them , and Gwen 's brother stepped up to take his arm . Jayell whirled around on him . " Put your hands on me , Larry , and I 'll knock you on your ass ! " " Jaaayell. ! " barked Miss Esther .. " Well , I did n't want him for a best man anyway ! The groom 's supposed to pick the best man , ai n't he ? And I do n't want him for my best man . . . " He pointed into the crowd below him . " I want ? I want Carlos ! " In the moment of stunned silence that followed he leaned down and clapped the startled black boy on the shoulder . " I want Carlos . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension in the air you could taste . The minister began anxiously clearing his throat .  | " Jayell , " said Miss Esther , " this has been enough for one day . " And to everyone 's surprise , especially Em , Carlos and me , Jayell stared right back at her , and his voice was almost sober . " It 's the most important day of my life , Miss Esther . I do n't want that punk to stand up with me . I want my friends . I want it to be special . " And Miss Esther understood . Through the drunkenness , the disheveled appearance , the childlike petulance , she understood that it was a special day for him , simply more than he could handle . " Well , this , " she said , " is just going too far . You 're only half of all this , Jayell . You 've got to remember  --  only half . " He considered , wobbling uncertainly on the step as he looked about . " Em , then . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at Gwen 's mother . " I do n't care ! " said the other woman with a quivering shake of her head , " I do n't care ! " We had all started into the church when Jayell , primed by that victory , played his last card . Faking a stumble , he cried , " I ca n't make it ! Carlos , come here ! " and before anyone could react he reached down and hauled Carlos up the steps . " Em , you keep hold of that side , Carlos , get this one . Hurt my foot ! " he called to the others . " Got to have my boy here help me . Hold that door there , son , " he told the usher . " Atta boy . " And before he could be stopped he was dragging the two of them through the foyer and down the bright blue carpeted aisle . The service was strained , but beautiful , and if I had thought the boarders were crying before , at the first chord of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . Before the ceremony was half over they had used up every Kleenex and pocket handkerchief in the pew . Miss Esther , prepared as usual for all contingencies , sat dry-eyed , one ear cocked to the proceedings , casually tearing off and passing along sheets of toilet paper she had wadded in her pocketbook . I have to admit , it finally got to me too . Whether it was the decorations , the music and the flowers and the romantic atmosphere , seeing Jayell down there looking as helpless as all grooms look at the altar , or the knowledge that Gwen was moving out of the house , I do n't know , but it was all I could do to keep from choking up . Gwen almost choked too , when she appeared in the aisle and saw the rumpled condition Jayell was in , and Em and Carlos looking  | sheepishly at her on either side of him . But aside from that initial jerk of surprise , she never showed it ; she gritted down and kept coming . Knowing Jayell , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some way . Jayell looked hung out and dried . He stood stolidly through the rites , haltingly murmuring his vows , with the toes of his stockinged foot laid over the one with the shoe . There was one awkward moment with the ring , a little chicanery I do n't think anyone else caught , but which I recognized as pure Jayell , having his wish at last . Em had stood listening intently for his cue , the ring handed to him by Gwen 's brother clutched tightly in his fist , and when the minister called for it to be placed on the prayer book he shoveled it out on his glistening palm . But at that moment Jayell 's elbow bumped Em 's , and the ring dropped to the floor . Instantly Jayell bent to retrieve it , and in a moment of apparent confusion , turned and shoved the ring on Carlos . The startled youth returned it to the prayer book with the speed with which he might have hand-fed a moccasin . The minister took it to the altar for the blessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they were pronounced man and wife , Jayell flipped up Gwen 's veil and kissed her , and started hauling her down the aisle . Mrs. Burns caught up with them at the door , and amid the confusion of congratulating boarders , Em and Carlos breaking for sunlight and small boys throwing rice , she reminded them about the reception . " You go right ahead and have it , darling , " shouted Jayell . " It 's all right , Mother , " said Gwen , catching at her gown as Jayell dragged her down the steps . But as Jayell reached sunshine and fresh air , all the strain , exhaustion and booze seemed to hit him at once . He wavered unsteadily , recovered , pulled Gwen toward the truck . " Jayell , " cried George Martin , " you 're taking my car , " which sat all decorated at the curb . " It 's all right , Mother , " said Gwen vacantly , and I realized the poor girl was feeling the strain too . Jayell pulled at her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Em hurriedly lifted him and stretched him out in the back of the  | truck , from which he raised himself momentarily in the shower of rice and yelled , " Carlos , get us out of here ! " before collapsing again . Poor terrified Carlos obediently jumped behind the wheel and fired the engine . " Y ' ai n't got your bride ! " screamed Em , and quickly hoisted the girl and dumped her in the battered cab beside Carlos . Fighting her gown and veil with a fist full of flowers , Gwen finally got rid of the bouquet by flinging it in a high backward arc . Gwen 's mother stood on the steps sobbing hysterically , aimlessly shoving her husband 's arm back and forth . Mr. Burns , well braced by Burroughs and Rampey , simply stood smiling as his daughter was driven away to her honeymoon in a truck with her groom passed out in the back . Carlos , a wrung-out case of nerves , with a white girl in a bridal gown beside him , clutched the wheel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I do n't think he took note of it when he cut too short at the corner and pulled the front fender off of Larry Burns 's Thunderbird .  | ONE OF THE FINEST THINGS TO DO ON A DULL SUNDAY AFTERNOON was to go inner-tubing on the Little Iron River , and the Sunday following Jayell 's wedding seemed perfect . The day had all the markings : the heat , the sluggish stirrings , the musty smell , like yesterday called back for another shift . By midmorning even the clouds seemed to knock off and head home , dragging their shadows over the clothesline . When I went down after breakfast to wake Jojohn , he rubbed his soles on the blanket , scratched the insides of his thighs , opened one eye and hung a string of profanity across a full minute . It was just that kind of a day . So , with nothing ahead more promising than a snake handler with cottonmouths everybody knew were defanged coming to Lamb of God Pentecostal that night , we decided to pick up Tio and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be good for Tio , too , we figured . Despite his and Em 's nagging , Mr. Teague still had n't come around to the notion of investing his small savings in a complete remodeling job and giving the supermarket a run for its money , and the store had continued to lose business .  | There was more in store for us that day than we imagined . Indeed , the world I had known was about to start coming apart at the seams . But at that moment , the only thought in our heads was to try and get around the corner of Sunday . Starting eight miles up at Shady Point , where an obliging cutter let us off , we shucked our clothes , shoved off in the inner tubes Em had rescued from a construction site , and spent the afternoon drifting home . That part of the river is gone today , the miles of fertile bottomland engulfed by the backwaters of the great Oconostee dam , and of course the speedboats would make it unsafe for tubing . But that summer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Iron River to go tubing on . I was trailing a fishing line as usual , though I snagged and lost more hooks than I ever caught fish . Once I hooked something really big , a catfish , Em said , since nothing else grew that big in the river , and I quickly discovered that a skinny boy in an inner tube is in a poor bargaining position with a fish of any size . We had a circular good time for several minutes until I capsized against a log . Em carried on so he nearly upset his cooler of beer , and Tio , naked except for his hat , laughed so hard he slipped down through his inner tube and nearly drowned . After we had been on the water about an hour the sky began to darken and it came up a shower , a brief summer spill that hung like a curtain over the river . As the chill set in we slid off the tubes and floated alongside . " Done this with a girl one time , " called Em . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicking closer and holding on tight to his hat . " Went swimmin ' in the rain . Purty little gal that lived down the road from us . " He hung his elbows over the side of his inner tube , in a soft mood , a wistful look on his face . " God , she was a fine little gal . " " Were you in love with her ? " I asked . " In a way , I reckon I was . But that was when I was young and did n't know nothin ' . " " How come you did n't marry her ? " said Tio . " She was white , " he said .  | " Somehow , Jojohn , " I said , " I ca n't see that stopping you . " Em paddled along with one hand , the rain draining down his face . " Like I said , I was young , and did n't know nothin ' . " " Maybe it ai n't too late , " said Tio , seizing on it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ai n't married to this day . She lives alone , and clerks in a store , and goes home every night and sets by herself . And she 's got this big old clawed-up tomcat that reminds her of you , and she just sets and looks at him . Why , I 'll bet if you went back there today . . . " Em said , " Shut up , Tio , I ca n't hear the rain . " We drifted along for a while in the cold gray splashing , moving slowly , without purpose , flowing where the river took us . Finally I said , " Are you still in love with her ? " " Sometimes , " he answered , " when I need her . " " What do you mean by that ? " " Love is a thing to take out when you need it , then put it away someplace . Nobody could stand it all the time . " " Jayell could , he 's got to have it all the time . " " Jayell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why he 's in the shape he 's in . Fools let it lead ' em around by the nose , like they do everything else . " " You mean to say you do n't wish you 'd married that girl , so she could be with you now ? " " If we 'd got married , that 'd have been one life . This one 's another . That 's all . " " But what 's the use of loving somebody , " I said , " if you ca n't have that somebody with you ? " Em pulled his hair out of his face . " Earl , all that 's between a man and a woman is the same that 's between two cats , or a couple of them fish down there . It 's just nature sayin ' , Get in there and replace yourself , bring on some more of your kind before you die ! ' Love is a thing in your mind . But , " he said , " you get attached to anybody or anything in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What if the person you love happens to be the wrong color , or you get separated for some reason ; what if they marry somebody else , or they die ? What are you going to do , let it tear you apart , and lay back and wailer and cry ! " He tapped his skull . " This is where you live , where all the things that matter are stored , where nobody ca n't get at ' em . You keep  | squared away up here , you 're all right , it do n't matter what goes on outside . " So , they come to take away a love you got  --  they ca n't do it , any more'n they can take your good times . It 's closed off , safe and warm , and whenever you need it , it 's there . It 's the only place it ever was anyway . " " You make it sound like going to the cupboard for a biscuit , " Tio said . Em rested a cheek on his hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me to drown you . " " That girl , is she with you now , Em , right this minute ? " Em nodded . " What 's it like , Em ? What 's it like ? " The rain was slackening off , falling to a scattered pelting across the water . Em lowered his chin on the tube . " Sssh . . . look , " he said , " listen . " From the shivering cold and chaotic gray splashing we drifted into the first shafts of sunlight breaking through the trees , soft dazzling strokes of warmth , dappling , sparkling on the water , the noise subsiding to the last pitting droplets from the overhanging leaves . And clearing before us again , the old beauty of the earth , comforting , familiar , yet fresh , emerging ever new , as always , from each shower . The trees , washed of their dust to deeper greens , lifted their branches lightly in the afterbreezes . Birds darted out , flicking , fussing at the wet , and slowly the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under the patching sunshadows the river flowed quietly again . Coming to the most deserted part of the river , the whine of saws began to reach us . We heaved ourselves into the inner tubes . Em pulled closer his cooler of beer . We would soon be passing Doc Bobo 's sawmill . Time for caution . Bobo ran the mill with black convict labor he bought from the county prison camp . It was not an uncommon practice , the so-called " work-release " programs , in which the most trusted convicts were allowed outside to work for private individuals for a small wage . But Bobo housed and fed his gang in his own enclosures at the mill . He took the worst lot , the hard cases , the troublemakers , and what wages  | there were went to the camp warden . It was a good arrangement . The county looked the other way . As we drew nearer the Negro convicts straightened from their work to look . We must have been a peculiar sight to them , free as chips , floating along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching with dripping faces until a scowling black guard , a " dog boy " in the characteristic snappy clothes and metal-studded leather belt , lifted his shotgun in the air . A warning to them , and us . They bent again to their work , the logs racked forth , the great saw screaming in the river-bottom heat of the quiet Sunday afternoon . From wire pens on the other side of the mill came the barking of the bulldogs Bobo bred for his fights . Farther down we spotted a big convict working on the bank , a great broad-shouldered giant with a hideous scar that ran from his scalp down across one clouded eye . He saw us and stopped and leaned on his ax . Em lazily paddled closer , appearing to doze , but keeping a sharp eye out . When he was within range , he pulled two bottles of beer from the cooler and sent them arcing toward the bank . The Negro nodded slowly and smiled . Cloudeye Pollock was boss con at the mill . He had once saved Em 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law and pulled a six-month sentence there . Em had quickly run afoul of the dog boys too , and landed in solitary confinement . . . throwed me in this twenty-foot hole in the ground , and said they 's going to let me starve . Liked to done it too . There was water down there , if you could drink it , but it was even too deep to find worms you could dig out of the bank . Well , sir , after I do n't know how long , weeks , whatever , when I was figurin ' that was about it , old Cloudeye killed a bulldog and dropped him down to me one night . It was tough as shoe leather , but it kept me alive till they decided to let me out of there . " We lazed along through the afternoon , all three half asleep by the time we made the final mile before home . As we drifted around the bend at Castle 's mill , I became dimly aware of singing . Far off , but coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly Em 's voice shook me wide awake . " Great God A'mighty ! " Rehoboth Pentecostal was situated near the river at that point ,  | and as I looked up I saw upwards of a hundred people filing down the hill toward the water . " It 's a blessed baptizin ' ! " said Tio , and the three of us began frantically back-splashing and hauling on the cord of the clothes bucket . But in our furor the line got loose and the tube carrying the bucket drifted away . Thrashing and bumping against each other , we eddied farther out into the swifter current , and soon we were so far out in the middle of the river there was danger of being seen . We reversed ourselves and struck hard for the cover of the bank . The singing was growing louder , and it seemed certain the three of us , naked , would coast directly into their midst . There was a fallen tree that stretched out from the bank and lay half submerged in the water , and the preacher and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We could hear the preacher 's voice coaxing his flock out into the stream . We slipped into the water , and clinging to the tubes , and steering and ruddering as best we could without splashing , drifted in among the opposite branches . It was too late to try and climb out ; with the crowds just yards away and children romping about there was no way to sneak up the bank and into the trees without being seen . We watched as the baptismal candidates filed along the other side of the tree , pulling themselves through the waist-deep water by groping the branches . A pair of deacons brought up the rear , steadying between them an enormous middle-aged lady who was obviously terrified of the water . They inched along , the two men speaking soothingly as she jerked and splashed , punching down her cotton dress and grabbing back at her supporters . Tio snickered and Em gripped him still . " Do n't you worry , sister Alford , " the pastor was saying , " they wo n't let you slip . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Look now , see , it 's only waist deep , and this is as far as we 're going . Now , we 'll just take you first and get it all over with . " " What ? Oh , no ! I just could n't , brother Reese . Let me wait till last ! I 'll be all right if you 'll just let me rest a minute ! " " Very well , sister , " said the reverend soothingly , " you just wait here and we 'll show you there 's nothing to worry about . " The preacher took the first man and folded his arms on his chest , and the service began . " I baptize thee , Walter Ethridge , in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost , " and he leaned  | the man down and quickly brought him up . " There , you see how easy it is , sister Alford ? " But from the look on her face , sister Alford was growing even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preacher continued , and finally they were all in a state of grace except sister Alford , who was in a state of near hysteria : " I just ca n't , brother Reese ! I just ca n't put my head under that water ! " " Now , sister , you 're not going to make us send you over to the Methodists , are you ? " There were chuckles among the deacons . " Just close your eyes and it 'll be over in a minute . " But when he tried to position her , sister Alford went rigid . He could n't budge her . " If you 'll give me a hand , brother Smith , brother Wiggins . . . " They came and stood by her side as the preacher prayed , and then they tried to immerse her . They might as well have tried to duck the rock of Gibraltar . She was fixed . They leaned and pulled . Sister Alford stood . Another brother came over and the four of them tried to wrestle her down . Tio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Two other men splashed down into the river and added their efforts . Brother Smith was lifting himself on her shoulders and brother Wiggins struggled to trip her ; all to no avail . They could have built a bridge on her . Laughter was breaking out along the bank . Suddenly sister Alford lost her balance , just enough to startle her out of her trance , and with a screech she threw off her attackers and bolted , tripped , and went under the surface , and somehow her flailings managed to become ensnared in the submerged branches of the tree . The preacher and the brothers clambered over each other , grabbing for the thrashing feet . " My God , " muttered Em , " she 'll bring the whole crowd down here ! Let 's try to push her out ! " He slipped under the water , and I followed him , with Tio , clamping a hand on his hat , right behind . We groped along through the branches until we found her , wedged in the limbs , eyes locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunstreaked water , hanging before her in all our naked glory . Em smiled . Tio lifted his hat . At that sister Alford freed herself . As we surfaced she was erupting on the other side of the tree in a violence of churning water . She whooshed straight up , bellowing at  | the top of her voice and plowing down deacons as she made for the bank . The others dived aside as she thundered by them in a storm of white cotton and foaming spray . The crowd on the bank cleared a path for her , and she charged through them and up the river road , honking and slinging water like a great white goose , until we lost sight of her through the woods . Through the silence came brother Reese 's voice . " Praise God ! " he shouted . " Sister Alford has seen Je-sus ! " And the river bottom resounded with hallelujahs . Luck was with us , and we found our bucket of clothes eddying against a hummock of trash about a mile farther down the river . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ape Yard , and stumbled up the railroad , worn out and ravenous . Tio offered to feed us , but we said we 'd take a chance on leftovers at home and came on up the hill . As we cleared the patch of woods above the garage I felt a mild twinge of alarm . Dr. Breisner 's car was parked in the driveway . He made regular visits to the boardinghouse , but a Sunday visit was out of the ordinary . Then , as we neared the yard Mrs. Porter suddenly burst onto the porch , veins standing in her neck , and stopped me cold . " Be brave , boy ! Be brave ! It 's your Aunt Esther  --  Lord God , honey , she 's dying ! "  | I FELL AGAINST THE DOOR , BREATHING HARD . MISS ESTHER WAS sitting up in bed buttoning her gown . Dr. Breisner stood beside her in his baggy seersucker suit , shaking down what looked to be , in my excitement , a large black thermometer , but turned out to be his fountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to get it to write . Miss Esther was staring at me . " Mr. Whitaker , what is this commotion ? " I tried to get my legs to stop quaking . " They said  --  what is it ? How is she , doctor ? " Miss Esther snorted . " You might as well talk to that wall . Doctors do n't talk , they just like to poke and feel . " Dr. Breisner tried a few marks on a prescription blank , tore it off and stared at his nib . " Heart , " he said . " What ? " Miss Esther was leaning half off her bed . " Speak up , Huff , I ca n't hear you . " " Heart attack , " he said , " plain , old-fashioned heart attack . " Miss Esther 's spine stiffened . " Heart attack ! Why there 's never  | been heart trouble in my family ! My daddy lived to be ninety-two and worked like a horse till the day he died . The Whitaker tickers are sound as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " " It was the Cahills ran to bad hearts . . . look at Wylie ! " " I know about Wylie , but the fact remains . . . " " Cancer . . . ! Now there was three or four took cancer . But not heart trouble ! " " I do n't care about that . . . " " Did you check for cancer ? Maybe it was cancer and looked like heart trouble . " " Damnit all , Esther , will you shut up a minute ! " Dr. Breisner leaned over her as though he might strike her if she interrupted again . " It 's your heart ! And besides that you 've got high blood pressure , and the last thing you need is to have me shouting at you ! " Dr. Breisner sat on the edge of the bed . " I 've got high blood pressure . I do n't need the shouting either . " He turned to her . " Now , listen to me . " Dr. Breisner knew he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there all night . " That spell this afternoon was serious , and I think you 've had these before . " He held up a hand to shush her . " Never mind , I 'm not interested . The fact is , you 've had enough . Your chasing around days are over . You run up those stairs one more time , you lift anything heavier than a chamberpot , and you 're going to be looking at Jesus . That 's as plain as I can put it into words . " Miss Esther pinched her lips . " Well , that just about makes me out to be an invalid ; is that what you 're saying , doctor ? " Dr. Breisner was serious . " You ought to be in a hospital right now . At any rate , you ca n't stay here . You keep running after these old folks and one day ? " He snapped his fingers . " Ca n't stay here ! Ca n't  --  well , just where do you think I can go ? Tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in North Carolina . . . " " Pffft ! " " Either that , or the county home . " Miss Esther looked at him . " Huff , you 're serious about that thing , ai n't you ? " Dr. Breisner did n't answer . He wrote out two prescriptions , tore  | them off and handed them to me . " I 'll drop you by the drugstore . I want her started on these tonight . " " How much longer do you give me , doctor ? " " You take your medicine , stop playing mother hen , and stay off those stairs , and I 'll get you married again . " " Well , " she said , " if all I got to worry about is heart trouble , I 'll count on it . Hah ! H000 ? what say , doctor ? " Dr. Breisner bit the edge of a smile and picked up his bag . As we came out on the porch she threw open the upstairs window . " I 'll count on it for sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to pay for this visit ! Hah ! " " Yeah , yeah , yeah . " Dr. Breisner was stepping over missing planks in the steps . When I got back from the drugstore she was downstairs repeating it for the others , embellishing , talking a mile a minute , rocking and harking in the best of spirits ; any traces of fear or anxiety were hidden in the vagaries of those incessant vocal thrashings , buried under that rock-hard surface of humor . Miss Esther followed the doctor 's orders for the whole of two days , then she was up again and running , chenille housecoat flying , supervising a complete housecleaning , leaf-raking , hedge-trimming . And she even had Em clean and paint the gutters , and repair the steps . We worried , the boarders pleaded , all to no avail . I was puzzled . I had seen the boarders do that : take an almost childish delight in defying the doctor , whispering behind their hands that they had n't been taking that new prescription . But for Miss Esther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't want the doctor to Arrow she was taking his advice , but she would . She was too sensible . Then , as I watched her moving among the boarders , it hit me for the first time , and hard , a thing that had never occurred to me would happen . Miss Esther , too , was getting old . " Em , I 'm worried . " " Hell , that old woman will be around to supervise all our funerals . " " She 's not herself , I can tell . " " Seems more herself than ever , if you ask me , " he said , leaning the ladder against the house .  | " And she 's up to something , I ca n't figure out what , but she 's got something cooking . " " She 's always up to sump'n . Time she ai n't , that 's when you want to worry . " " No , I mean something serious . A couple of times I 've caught her on the telephone late at night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . One time she was talking to the operator , like it was long distance . " " Yeah ? " That got Em 's interest . The two absolutely unjustifiable extravagances in Miss Esther 's household were steak and long-distance phone calls . One Friday morning , three weeks after her attack , I was making the rounds with the bell when Miss Esther called me into her room . She was sitting up in bed , looking tired , drawn , as though she had n't slept . Only her voice had the old brusqueness and strength . " Well , it 's all settled . Vance will be here Thursday . " " Ma'am ? " " Going to North Carolina , you and me . Stay with Van and Lucille . They 've got a big place outside of Durham , plenty of room . How about that , hah ? " " We 're  --  leaving here ? " I felt my blood pounding , a distant feeling . Unreal . " I did n't want to say anything till it was all settled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I got to lay back , I 'll lay back on Mr. Vance . He 's got it coming , the hateful thing . " " But , you do n't have to do , we 'll take care of you . " " Who ? These old folks ? Pshaw ! Ca n't hardly take care of themselves . No , sir , there ai n't no invalids in this house . I never let ' em lay down on me , and I ai n't going to show ' em how . " She took off her glasses and looked at me . " How long you been with me , boy ? " " Eight . . . " I cleared my throat , " eight years . " " Hmh , " she nodded . " Purt near raised you , did n't I , young ' un ? We purt near got it done . Well , there 's sump'n you better understand . Vance ai n't too happy about assumin ' responsibility for you , so you 'll have to watch your p 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We never did have much of a family . Like old man Burroughs says , relatives are generally people you would n't be seen with if you was n't kin to ' cm . Do n't lay too much store by family . laid too much store  | by family and look where it got me : married to Wylie Cahill and dragged to this hell hole a virgin and a bride . " " Then what you want to move in with Vance for ? " " To collect , that 's what for ! That scoundrel owes me ! I tried to help him  --  give , give , give , and all he ever done for me was kill off Wylie , and that was unintentional . Well , it 's Mr. Vance 's turn to do some giving , and old mama 's going to collect . " She tapped her chest . " My ticket 's punched . " " What about the boarders ? " I said . " What 's going to happen to them ? " Miss Esther polished her glasses . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could . They just got to take over from here . " She was holding it in with that iron control , dealing with facts , not emotion . " I never let ' em quit up to now . I ca n't do no more . Tell ' em I want to see ' em in the parlor after breakfast . " She sat looking out of the window . " I 'm not hungry . I 'll stay with you a while . " " There 's a place waiting for you at the table , mister ! "  | VANCE AND LUCILLE CAHILL ARRIVED ON THURSDAY MORNING IN a new station wagon with the eleven-year-old twins , Victor and Vanessa , asleep on a mattress in the back , and towing an aged bird dog in a U-Haul trailer . " Spider goes ever'where with us , " chuckled Vance proudly , lifting the bruised animal down . Vance was approaching forty now , with bulging neck and a thick stomach and a sweaty , blond crew-cut . The twins were perfect miniatures of their father . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her wrist and complaining about the heat , and her brother clambered straight up the steps , brushing aside his grandmother 's arms , shouting that he had to " tee-tee . " Their mother , a frail listless woman with a perpetual headache , stood waving in their commotion without interest , as though birthing this pair had simply shucked her . Introduced to me , she gave a cordial wince of pain and sought the nearest chair . Vance 's greeting to his mother dwelled mainly on his surprise at how much weight she had put on . She returned the compliment , introduced him around , and spent the rest of the evening in her room packing while Farette fed us supper . Afterwards , when the boarders  | had escaped to their rooms , Vance sat at the table moodily watching Farette and me clear away the dishes while Victor and Vanessa pulled things from the kitchen cabinets , chased each other around the room and wrestled under the table . Finally he called me into the dining room . He sat propped on his elbow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , boy ? " " Fourteen . " Vance shook his head . " What kind of work can you get at fourteen ? " He fingered a beet pickle out of the jar and rolled it in his jaw . " I 'm tall , I 'd probably pass for much older . " He looked me over . " Nah , never do it . Damn , ought a be sump'n ? what are you doin ' now ? You 're doin ' sump'n to help pay your keep here , ai n't you ? " " Well , I do chores . . . " " I mean payin ' work , boy ! How about a paper route ? Ai n't you even got a paper route ? " " I 've tried . There 's a waiting list . " " I 've never heard of such a thing ! " " It 's a small town , a small paper . " Vance eyed me suspiciously . " Well , by God , you c'n bet I 'll find you sump'n ! " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dried them in his pocket . " You 'll not lay off and grow fat at my house and not turn a hand . " Further discussion was made impossible at that point by Victor and Vanessa , who were trying to pull the cat from behind the refrigerator with a coat hanger . " Off to bed , everybody , " ordered Vance . I slept on the extra bed in Mr. Jurgen 's room , as Victor claimed my room for himself . He did n't sleep much , though ; I could hear him most of the night searching through my closet and dresser . In fact , hardly anyone slept that night . To a stranger first coming , it might have gone unnoticed , but if you live for a while in a house of old people , you become attuned to certain shadings of solitude , levels of quiet . You find that there is a difference between the silence of sulking and the silence filled with grief , or the silence of someone merely listening to the softening of a day . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloom of an African violet , the arrival of a photograph of a new grandson , a call to the telephone after a long Sunday 's wait , the reaction was small perhaps  --  the quick whisper of  | slippers on the carpet , a tap on a door , a soft murmuring  --  but under it all an exuberance that rang through the house . And that night , with its muted stirrings : a restless toss of bedsprings , a window sliding open , the jerk of the bathroom light chain , the intensity was there . The house was as charged as a summer storm . Mr. Jurgen turned over in his bed . I was afraid my own tossing had kept him awake , and braced for his griping . Instead , he said softly , " I ca n't sleep . " " Sir ? " Mr. Jurgen had never before spoken to me in a tone softer than a sharp reprimand . He did n't speak again right away . He lay on his side , looking over the end of his pillow . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to become of us . " I sat up in bed . I could n't believe it ! My old enemy , Mr. Jurgen . I got out of bed and went and stood beside him . " Are you scared , Mr. Jurgen ? " He did n't answer . " Mr. Jurgen , " I said , " are you scared ? " He lay looking up at me from the cold square of moonlight , his hands knotted on top of the covers . I leaned over him . " Do n't you be scared , Mr. Jurgen , " I said angrily . " Do n't you do that to me ! I was scared one time . I lay in that room over there scared to death through many a night , and all you done was complain about my crying . Now do n't you make me care about your being scared . It ai n't right . It ai n't fair . I do n't care what happens to you ! I do n't care if they take you to the county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to see you again ! You do n't deserve nothing better , you hear me ? You do n't deserve nothing better , you sorry old . . . " Suddenly he jerked upright and slapped me across the face . " Get away from me ! " he shouted . " If you 're going to stay in my room you get back in that bed and keep your impudent mouth shut , you hear me ? I hope  --  I hope that son of hers puts you in the reformatory where you belong ! " And he whirled over in bed and snatched the covers over his ears . I went back to my bed , my face hot and stinging . That 's better , Mr. Jurgen , T thought . Much better . Hate me , but do n't make me cry with you . Do n't make me cry with you . I could n't stand that just now .  | THE VANCE CAHILLS WERE IN TOWN ONLY THROUGH THE WEEKEND , the time required to " get Miss Esther 's affairs in order , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crating up the things that Lucille liked , and those that Miss Esther absolutely refused to part with , for shipment to North Carolina . On Sunday afternoon Mr. J. J. Bearden of Bearden Real Estate assembled everyone in the living room . Mr. Bearden was a humble , hunch-shouldered man with a confidential air who leaned close when he talked and breathed on you like a dentist . He greeted each of the boarders in turn , and waited until they were settled . As he was about to start , the front door opened and Mr. Teague came into the parlor , followed by Tio , who took a seat with Em and me on the hall stairs . Mr. Teague made his way to a chair , nodding to everyone , and sat slowly rubbing his knees , watching Victor and Vanessa shove each other off the coffee table . Miss Esther stayed in her room . " Ah , what a terrible , terrible time , " said Mr. Bearden , licking his long front teeth . " I 've been a friend of Wylie and Esther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I ca n't tell you what sadness it brings me to conduct the business at hand . " Mr. Bearden said that a buyer for the property had already been found , and he was happy to assure everyone that the house would continue just like Miss Esther had wanted , as a home for all of her old friends for as long as they wished to stay . The boarders were visibly relieved . " However , " continued Mr. Bearden , " the new owner finds it necessary to make a slight increase in the rate you are now paying . " " How slight ? " Mr. Jurgen wanted to know . " Ten dollars a month . " " Ten dollars ! " cried Mrs. Porter . " Esther Cahill , " Mr. Bearden said hastily , " is , as you all know , a most generous woman , but we must remember that to the new owner this is strictly a business enterprise , with certain obvious risks . The house is already in an advanced state of decay , and to assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living here . . . " " Who 's disabled ! " roared Mr. Burroughs , getting to his feet . " We 're not disabled , " echoed Mrs. Cline . " Yes , well . . . nevertheless . . . " Mr. Bearden had to step over Victor and Vanessa , who were wrestling at his feet . " But we ca n't afford ten dollars more a month , " protested Mrs. Porter . " I 'm very sorry , " said Mr. Bearden , " there 's nothing I can do . " " Why the very . . . ! " Mr. Burroughs was interrupted by Victor and Vanessa tumbling against his legs . He whirled on Lucille . " Madam , if you do n't get a hand on these disgusting look-alikes , I 'm gon na stomp ' em into one obedient child ! " Lucille immediately scurried to collar her children and bustled them off to the kitchen . Vance sat glowering , but said nothing . " Please , " said Mr. Bearden , " there 's really no point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Rampey spoke up . " Who is this new owner , we 'll have a talk with him . " " For reasons of his own he has asked to remain anonymous , " said Mr. Bearden . " Anyway , I 'm sure it would be useless to bargain . He and I have agreed that it would be impossible to operate the house profitably at the current rate . It 's simply a matter of dollars and cents . Now , Farette has agreed to stay on as cook and housekeeper ,  | and Mr. Jojohn " ? he looked around until he found Em on the stairs ? " Mr. Jojohn , you may continue to stay in that garage on the property , and take your meals at the house , and you will be paid ten dollars a month to continue in charge of general maintenance . . . but for that additional salary we must be assured of a little more regularity from you . You must agree to stay on the premises year round and not go rambling off when the mood strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambled into the living room and looked down at the realtor . " Horse face , you could n't buy my regularity for ten thousand dollars a month . If the deal I had with the old woman ai n't good enough for you and your boss I 'll leave tonight . Fact , it 's gettin ' to be too much of a strain anyhow . Place is so old and wore out it takes twelve hours a day now to keep the pipes from comin ' apart and steps from fallin ' in and killin ' somebody . Might pay us both if you just got somebody else to keep the place up , wash the windows , rake the yards , clean the gutters , fix busted furniture , unstop the drains . . . " " Now , now , Mr. Jojohn . . . I 'm sure we can come to terms suitable . . . " " I 'll tell you what I 'll do , " said Em . " I 'll stay in the loft until I get tired of stayin ' there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , and I feel up to it , I 'll do it . I do n't want no meals , and I do n't want a dime from you nor that son of a bitch  --  pardon me , ladies  --  that was ashamed to show his face here tonight . Them 's my terms , and until somebody comes down to that loft to throw me out , I 'll figure they 're agreeable to all sides . " Em started to put on his hat and stopped at the sound of sniffling coming from the corner . It was Mrs. Metcalf . She looked up , dabbing at her nose with a handkerchief . The Indian bent down to her . " You scared , little lady ? " She went on sniffling , looking up at him like a frightened little girl , wadding the handkerchief to her mouth . Em frowned . " There 's a mean old woman upstairs , " he said . " She 'd raise holy hell if she knowed you 's down here carryin ' on that away . " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Em turned around to those in the parlor . " She put in a lot o ' time on you people . You was her family , more of her family than her own , and she took a lot of pride in you . Now , if you got notions that you  | ai n't people no more , if you do n't think you 'll have the gumption to put on your clothes and feed yourselves when she 's gone , and you 're gon na go to pieces and start actin ' like a bunch of damn fools , I 'd appreciate if you 'd just pack your bags and call your young'uns to come get you ! And I wish you 'd do it tonight and be gone ' fore she comes down in the mornin ' . I got a lot o ' respect for that old woman , and I 'd hate to see her shamed thataway ! " He stopped for a moment , looking at me and at Tio , then abruptly jammed his hat on his head and stalked out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun I took a last walk through the Ape Yard . I walked along the hogback hills , through the glowing fingers that probed the shadows of the hollow , breaking a weed , smelling it , looking again at the store , stopping to remember that place in the river . It was a dismal place , after all ; what could there be of gullies and shanties and vine-covered trees to carry away ? There would be other sandy creeks , other gulley fortresses , other banks to slide on to the river . I crossed the hollow and walked up into the town , circling the square , and along the closed stores , looking for someone to say goodbye to . I had spent most of my life in the town , should n't there be someone to let know I was leaving ? Gwen had said she would arrange things at school , but would n't there be another person who , after a week or so , would say , " Whatever happened to old Earl Whitaker ? Where has he gone ? " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't there ? Would n't there ? I stood on the square and gazed along the rows of empty storefronts . Overhead the automatic streetlights were fading on , rising to the darkness as the sun comes to morning , lighting whoever may be standing there , casting the same light when he is gone . There was a vagrant sitting on a park bench nearby . A man with a curl of red hair stuck to his pasty white forehead . He sat with one shoe off pulling a sock luxuriously through his toes , his yellowed eyes watching me . I turned and walked away . Late in the night , after hours of walking , I found myself back in the Ape Yard , in front of the Starlite Cafe in Cabbage Alley . The Starlitc was run by Gus Mayfair , who was a porter at the Marble  | City Hotel uptown until the new manager fired him for drinking . 1 stopped and tapped on the glass . Gus came from behind the counter with a rag in his hand and squinted through the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I , uh  --  I was just leaving town and thought I 'd get one more of your good hamburgers , Gus . " " I done turned off the grill , " he said . Gus was sleepy and did n't like working at the cafe anyway . Gus had enjoyed working at the hotel , where he got to wear a uniform and rich white people tipped him and joked with him . But the new manager had let him go . It had been all right with the old manager if he took a drink on the job ; the old manager drank himself , and surprised a man in one of the rooms now and then . But the new manager had let Gus go , even though he only took an occasional drink . " That 's okay , " I said , " maybe I 'll stop by the bus station diner . " Gus waited with the key in the lock . There was a long crack across the glass door where a drunk had tried to kick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spine and ribs of tape . " I 'm going up to North Carolina , " I said . " I do n't guess I 'll be coming back . " " Yeah  --  well , good luck to you . " " Right , " I said . " Well , goodbye , Gus . " The door closed and a moment later the neon sign went out and hugs plunged and dived and fluttered about helplessly in the dark . I climbed the hills to the garage and I knew , long before I was close enough to look for a light , that there would be none . There was no need to strike a light , I knew every splinter of the place . Finding Em 's cot , I tumbled on it and lay in the dark and listened to the high whine of the gulley crickets and the muffled , faraway drone of the Ape Yard . The loft , still smelling of warm daydust , cracked and popped as the old garage settled itself in the cooling air of the night .  | BY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE STATION wagon was loaded , and the hired ambulance had arrived for Miss Esther . Vance had howled in protest over the extravagance until a hurried call to the insurance agent reassured him that it was covered by her major medical . But when the men arrived with a stretcher she shooed them out of her room and came down carrying her bag . She further flabbergasted her son by ordering one of the attendants into the back and crawling in beside the driver . " But , Mama , " spluttered Vance , " what 's the good of having an ambulance if you 're going to ride up front ? " " I 'll lay down if I get tired , " she said . " First I want to see how this gentleman drives . You all up there " ? she adjusted her hat and looked along the line of boarders at the porch balustrade ? " you better write to me , now . " There were to be no hand-wringing goodbyes , she had made sure of that . She was up before daylight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she just looked at them , her old soldiers lined stiffly at the rail , and they at her , etching in , I supposed ,  | those last details of face and feature , the turn of a mouth , the slope of a shoulder , as I had painted in my trees , my bend in the river . When at last she was done , Miss Esther nodded , cranked up her window and ordered her driver on . The boarders turned and filed past me into the house , still dryeyed , though Mrs. Metcalf was straining hard , and as they passed , each one touched me in a brief goodbye , a squeeze of the arm , a clap on the head , and walked on , none of us trying to speak in a moment too tight , too full for the rattle of empty words . Vance worked my suitcase under the straps of the luggage carrier , and I crawled into the station wagon between the twins , each of whom had claimed family rights to a window seat . Vance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly Victor rolled down the window and yelled : " You get out of this yard , nigger ! " Tio leaned his bike against the steps and came over to the car . Victor shook his fist in Tio 's face . " You want to fight , nigger ? " " Be still , " I said , " he 's a friend of mine . " Tio handed me a sack through the window . " Mr. Teague sent you some apples . " " Do n't you touch this car , " warned Victor . Vanessa giggled . " Tell him thank you for me . " Tio nodded . He tried to say something else but kept getting interrupted by Victor , who had devised a new game . Watching Tio closely , he carefully managed to keep his head in our line of sight . Tio moved around to the back window and lifted his voice . " You seen Em ? " " No , I was about to ask you . . . " Tio shook his head . He looked at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tell him . . . " Tio had to cup his ear , Victor and Vanessa were rapping their knuckles on the glass , making faces at him . " Tell him what . . . ? " Tio was straining to hear . " Nothing , " I said . " Never mind . " Tio adjusted his hat . The nervous tic was starting under his eye . The twins had their faces pressed against the back window , their tongues madly licking the glass . " Well , if I do n't see you again " ? he looked down at the noses pressed flat , the pink tongues lapping large  | wet circles ? " take care . " And , snatching a brick out of the flower bed , he slammed it against the window with such a bone-jarring smack that both twins ' foreheads bounced off the glass . They thrashed about in the seat with such howls that eventually Vance ran waddling out of the house , but by that time Tio was pedaling far down the street . Finally we got under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rabbit country , swaying heavily in the dips and turns , the U-Haul tugging on the bumper . Vance cursed under his breath as his push-button settings failed to turn up any country music stations . He fiddled with the dial . Lucille sat tense and silent , one hand covering her eyes , cringing as far as she could from the blaring speaker . The air in the back was stifling . The twins twisted the knobs of the window handles and eyed me maliciously , the sweat standing out on their fat faces . It was as if they could see their odors attacking me . I knew they were sizing me up , resenting this intrusion into their family , and unsure yet as to how to turn it to their own advantage . As we rode I stopped feeling sorry for poor Spider cramped in the overloaded U-Haul . He had by far the better deal . We crossed Broad River into South Carolina . Vance , having found his blue-grass , now puffed his cigar contentedly , his wrist hung over the wheel , snapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jockey , an energetic teenager , segued a chattering teletype over his music and fearlessly attempted a news cast , forcing his voice down an octave for the occasion . " Repeating an earlier news bulletin  --  the Supreme Court ruled today that the states of the nation do not have the right to separate Negro and white pupils in different public schools . By a unanimous 9 to 0 vote , the High Court held that such segregation of the races is unconstitutional . " " What ! Good God-a-mighty ! " Vance lunged forward and whipped up the volume . " Quiet , everybody ! " " The most violent reaction came from Georgia Governor Herman Talmadge , who has repeatedly vowed that there will never be mixed schools while he is governor . In a prepared statement the governor said , and I quote , The United States Supreme Court by its decision today has reduced our Constitution to a mere scrap of paper . It ( the court ) has blatantly ignored all law and precedent and usurped from the Congress and the people the power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the laws of the land . ' Governor James F. Byrnes of South Carolina , a former Supreme Court justice , said because it has been held many times the separatebut-equal doctrine , and I quote again , was not violative of the Constitution , I am shocked to learn that the Court has reversed itself . ' For further developments , stay tuned to ? " The announcer gave the station 's call letters , the time , and played a jingle that launched the next half-hour of his show . " By damn , did you hear that ? " Vance was purple . " Have they gone slap crazy ? Did he say all the schools , or when they had to be mixed ? Did you hear him say when ? " Lucille shook her head , or perhaps she only trembled . " I 'm gon na stop and call that station , " said Vance . " That kid did n't give enough to tell what the hell 's going on ! " " Oh , Van , " whined Lucille , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out when we get home . I want to get on home . " " No , sir ! " bellowed Vance , rising to the hint of opposition , " I 'm gon na get the straight dope , and while I 'm at it I might just give ' em a little hell for lettin ' a damn kid give out such an important item as that . " Vance hooked an elbow over the back of the seat and addressed himself to me , glancing only occasionally at the road . " You take , I do n't care who it is , when they get on the radio or the TV they got a responsibility to the public , and when they screw up I for one let ' em know about it ! I call up the stations around home all the time . There was one last week , had a preacher on that did n't know as much about the Bible as that kid there " ? indicating Vanessa , who , looking faint , had her nose pressed to a private half-inch crack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' off about the Garden of Eden bein ' a symbol , and all that stuff . You know , college preacher . Well , I got the station manager on the phone and did n't I tell him a thing ! He was real nice about it . Damn , there ought a be a gas station around here somewhere . You seen one , honey ? " Lucille shook her head , or trembled , again . Vance grinned in the mirror . " You ca n't fool me about my Bible , " he continued . " I keep up with my preaching . I 've heard the best of ' cm . I used to like Billy Graham till he got surrounded by all them sharkskin suits . I still like Oral Roberts , though , he 's all right . I seen him in person once , " Vance bragged , " he healed a pregnant woman . "  | Lucille raised her head and looked at him . " She had a crippled laig , " she explained . " Yeah . Well , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . She just throwed down her crutches and danced up and down that aisle . They had to carry her out of there . " " On account of she was so happy , " appended Lucille . " Right . Hey , look , there 's a station just over that next rise . Anybody got to go ? " Vance pulled in to the side of the station and went in to the pay phone . Victor and Vanessa grabbed the paddle-key from the attendant and raced around the corner to the ladies ' room , their mother tottering along behind with a bottle of Lysol , calling for them to wait . I pushed open the door and jumped out and stood leaning on the burning car in the clean , fresh air . Vance 's back was to me . He gestured wildly to the party on the phone . There was no time for reasoning . Sometimes desperation relieves us of that civilized faculty and throws us directly on our instincts , where things get done . And in that moment I acted on instinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouting in my ear . I clawed my suitcase out of the luggage carrier and broke for the nearby woods as hard as my feet could run . At the edge of the trees I threw my bag over a barbed-wire fence and dived after it and rolled in the grass like a dog . Families , like houses , sometimes have a distinctive smell , and theirs was clinging to me like pond scum . After a while they reassembled at the car and noticed my absence . Vance went to the men 's room and came back shaking his head . They held a conference . Vance honked the horn a few times , then circled the station calling me and looked into the men 's room again . Then Victor noticed my suitcase missing . He and Vanessa ran out and looked up and down the highway and Vance went back to question the station attendant . There was an anxious moment when it occurred to me that he might call the police , but presently he came stomping back to the car , ordered them all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out onto the highway . I stood up from behind the fence and watched it grow small in the distance , the white moon faces of Victor and Vanessa still looking out the back window . A cool breeze washed through the pasture , bringing the sweet smell of the grass and trees . The sun burned  | cleanly through the sweep of the land . I stood at the edge of the trees and said goodbye to the last remnants of that strange institution : my family . I supposed it would be the last I would see of Miss Esther , and I would miss her . I knew for a fact it was the last I would see of the Vance Cahills . And , as it turned out later , it was the last I was to see of my bonehandled hunting knife that cousin Victor had seen me packing , and so admired . I spent the rest of the day and part of the night hitchhiking my way back home , finally catching a ride the last leg from Little Holland with a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick up hitchhikers , he said , but I had an honest face . He was so friendly it flashed through my mind that I might have found myself another sharpshooter . But I was wrong , and later felt ashamed about it . He was just a nice man who wanted to do me a favor . We chatted along and he told me about his hobby , which was making piggy banks out of discarded coffee cans . He let me have one for half price . Coming across the railroad trestle by moonlight , shaking a pebble in the coffee-can bank , and catching sight of the boardinghouse with its hall light burning , it was as though I had been away a thousand years . I ran through the front door and climbed through the house , shouting everyone awake . " Mr. Rampey ! Mr. Burroughs ! Mrs. Bell ! I 'm home . . . Mrs. Cline ! " They piled into the hall in their nightclothes , shouting , grabbing me , calling to wake the others . It was a carrying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions at once , interrupting each other , re-asking things I 'd just answered , Mr. Rampey loudly echoing every word for Mr. Woodall . " To the dinin ' room ! " shouted Farette , elbowing her way through , " I swear to goodness ! " When we were finally settled in the dining room , I had to start all over . Farette got her stove fired up and put the coffee pot on , dashing to the door every two minutes to catch what she could . When I was all done , and every minor point covered to everyone 's satisfaction , they all sat quietly , mulling over this new turn of events . " Well , " said Mrs. Porter , patting my hand , " we 'll write Esther and  | tell her not to worry about a thing . We 'll take good care of you . You 're our little boy now . " I put down my cup . " I 've been thinking about that , " I said . " I thought about it all the way home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's little boy anymore . And I sure ca n't ask you to keep me . " " What ? " she said . " Why that 's nonsense , " said Mrs. Metcalf . " Hey , sport , " said Mr. Rampey , " you do n't have to worry . . . " " No , I mean it . " I cleared my throat and tried to sound as mature , as deliberate as I could . " I appreciate everything you 've done for me , you and Miss Esther . But it 's time I was on my own . It 's going to be hard enough on you as it is , and now that they 've upped your rent . . . " " By God ! " snorted Mr. Burroughs , " first we 're disabled  --  now we 're paupers ! " " Mr. Burroughs , I mean no disrespect , but I ca n't be a burden any longer , not to you or anybody . Let 's face it , we 're all on our own now . Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But where will you stay ? " asked Mrs. Bell . " I 'll move out in the garage loft with Em , if he comes back , that is . Farette spoke from the door . " You 'll get a fever in that place ! " The others started in with their protests . I got up and walked to the door . " Please understand , my mind 's made up . I 've got to do it . I 've got to try . " They were silent for a while . They looked at each other anxiously , each waiting for the other to speak . Finally Mrs. Metcalf said , " You would come to us if you needed anything . . . ? " " If I need you . I promise . And please do n't tell Miss Esther , it would only worry her more . " I started out . " Boy . . . ! " Mr. Burroughs got up and came to the door , his long fingers closing tightly on my arm . " You do what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you get in trouble , you need anything , and you do n't come to us  --  I 'll take a stick to you . " " Yes , sir . " In dead seriousness , he leaned close and confided , " You can trust us . We 're not family . "  | " Yes , Mr. Burroughs . " As I passed by Farette at the stove , her cordy little hand reached out and snagged my belt . " You still comin ' for yo ' meals , I expect . " " No , Farette , do n't you see , it would be pointless if I did that . " She turned back to the stove . " Do what you want , then . Make no difference to me . " I started to leave , then stopped , and reached over and kissed her quickly on the cheek . She stiffened , but quickly busied herself again at the stove . I picked up my suitcase and walked out of the kitchen , stepping carefully over the roses .  | I AWOKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RAINING , and water leaked through a crack beside the window and splattered on the sill . It took several moments to realize where I was , and then I lay on Em 's cot listening to the rain drumming and fighting the empty feeling inside me . I pulled the footlocker up to the window and sat looking up through the trees toward the boardinghouse . It sat still and gray in the rain , the warmth , the look of life still lingering . It would n't be for long , I thought , without Miss Esther . I stood up and shoved the footlocker back in place . Enough , she would have said . There was n't time for that . There were too many things to sort out . Too much to be done . One step at a time , Mr. Whitaker . Just one single step at a time . When the rain let up I bounded out of the loft and went looking for Tio . And once out again and moving , I felt better . I broke into a run , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him struggling along Cabbage Alley , his basket loaded and a kerosene can on the handlebars with an Irish potato plugging the spout .  | With a shout and a running dive off a high yard I caught him around the neck and we , the bike and the groceries went piling into the gutter . The hollering and wrestling brought out the neighborhood dogs , and they danced around the mud puddles rejoicing with us until one of them found a broken package of bologna and led the others away . Finally Tio shoved me away . " Hey man ! What 's the matter with you ? Help me get this stuff ! " and he scrambled to replug the pouring kerosene . I tried to help him , but I could n't . All I could do was sit in the mud and laugh . A woman came around the corner leading a little girl in pigtails and stopped and stared at my condition . That was even funnier . I jumped up and started grabbing canned goods and shoving them in her arms . She hurriedly dragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was drunk , and could not be responsible . " All right , " Tio said firmly , " now get a hold of yourself . What you doin ' back here ? " I told him , as best I could , about the break from the Cahills , about leaving the boardinghouse . " I 'm a man , " I said . " Yeah . Right . Now get your head about you . You hungry ? You had anything to eat ? " I shook my head and Tio unwound a can of Vienna sausage . I wolfed it down , along with a wedge of cheese . " Where you gon ' live now ? " " In the loft , I guess . Where 's Jojohn , have you seen him ? " " Some of ' em said he was hittin ' the joints down river toward Cedar Crossing . Said they seen him in Birdsong 's the other night , tyin ' on a drunk that 'd put all his others in the shade . " " Birdsong 's ? I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheriff 's always closin ' him down . But somehow he gets open again . You goin ' after Jojohn ? " " No , I do n't think so , " I said . Tio looked at me . " How come ? " " I do n't know . I 've just got this feeling . . . No , if he 's still around , and he wants to come home , let him . If not , well , that 's okay too . " Tio shrugged . " Suit yourself . " He kicked up the stand and got on his bike . " Hey , " I said , " let 's go take a dip in the river . " " What ? I got work to do , I ai n't got no time to go swimmin ' ! "  | " Aw , come on , Tio , just one . . . " " And you ai n't neither ! You got to start figurin ' how you gon ' live now your aunt 's gone ! Where you gon ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tio . . . " " Naw , man , you got to think about them things . You 're on your own now , you got responsibilities . " " Tomorrow ! ? I 'll work it all out tomorrow . " " Tomorrow ! You do n't even know where you gon ' eat tonight ! You talkin ' ' bout bein ' a man  --  you 're more like a newborn baby ! Now you get that playin ' out your head and start tendin ' to business . " " Well , I do n't know how to  --  I do n't know where to start ! " " That 's what I figured . All right , you start with Jayell . He just back from his honeymoon , maybe he 's got some work you can do . And school ! Tomorrow mornin ' you get yourself up there and get checked back in that school ' fore you lose a whole year . " " Oh ! Yeah , hey , guess what I heard on the radio . . . ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he continued , " enough to last you a couple of days anyway , in case Jojohn ai n't back before then . And if he 's gone for good , well , we 'll just have to work sump'n out . But right now you get down to Jayell 's and see about that job . " He shoved off and pedaled down the street . " It 's close to dinnertime , he ought to be around the shop now . Get goin ' , man . You 're grown now . No more good times . " " The school , " I yelled after him , " did n't you hear ? We may be goin ' together . They 've passed a law ! " Tio threw up a hand , but I knew he did n't hear me . He was pushing away hard , his whole body pumping on the strokes . I found Jayell sitting in his truck behind the shop , lunching on a can of tomatoes . " Where the hell did you come from ? " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cahills anymore and had decided to come back , and wondered if he had any work for me . Jayell rummaged in his pocket . " Hell , I 'll spot you some money , Early boy . " " I did n't come begging , " I said . " I come looking for work . " Jayell looked at me . " Well , things are about as bad for me as they can get right now , Earl . That damned house of Gwen 's has just about  | put me under ; drained off most everything I had in the bank , I 'm behind on two loans now , and business is about as bad as I 've ever seen it . I 've got one house under way right now , and after that  --  I do n't know what we 'll do . " Jayell shook his head . " And to have to take time off for a honeymoon ! " " Well , look , I do n't want to put you out . I know I 'm not too good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help right now . . . " " Help , sure I need help , " he said quickly . " I need all the help I can get ! You feel like doing some painting ? " I was confused , as I usually ended up when I tried to follow Jayell 's thinking . " But I thought you said . . . " " Kid , you want to talk or you want to work ? I asked you about the painting . " " Sure , I like to paint . . . " " Okay , then , get in . You can free up Skeeter so he can get back to the shop . He hates a paintbrush anyway . You 're slow but you 're careful , and that 's what counts . " Jayell tossed away the empty tomato can and cranked the truck . " Come on  --  you going ? Get in , get in ! " The house was for a young black quarry worker named Ruben Johnson who had just moved down from Salisbury . Jayell was building him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fletcher Bottom . The house stood about twelve feet from the ground with a walkway running to the bank of the street . Skeeter gladly turned over his paintbrush and I took his place on the ladder . How fast things had settled back down , I thought . Here I was an orphan one day , with no place to go , and a working man the next , with a full-time job and a place to live . Who needed more than that ? Maybe a painter was what I was cut out to be . Certainly I was no good at carpentry , and the thought of a quarry gave me the shivers . Even Jayell said I was a good painter . Well , he came as close to saying that as Jayell could get to a compliment . Maybe I 'd have my own van truck some day  --  and hire a couple of helpers ! The only drawback I could see was I had n't any experience with liquor . Well , I 'd just have to learn the trade a step at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slanting over the rim of the Ape Yard and we were racing to finish against the oncoming dark , one of the boys on the roof said something and pointed . I looked down and saw a car pulling to a stop under the chinaberry trees . It was a dark green Lincoln Continental .  | Doc Bobo and Clyde Fay got out and stepped quickly along the planking , followed by a little man who hurried along behind them clutching a shirt pocket bulging with ball-point pens . I recognized him as the man who had been selling the cheap , prefabricated little homes around town . " Who 's building this house ? " demanded Doc Bobo . One of the boys pointed to Jayell on the roof . Doc Bobo lifted his hat to shade his eyes . " I 'm told you 're building this house for Ruben Johnson , " he said . Jayell pulled a shingle into place . " That 's right . Why ? " " There must be some mistake , " said the salesman . " He told me when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me build it for him . " " Oh ? First I heard about it . " He looked at the man . " You got a contract ? " " He was to sign today , " said the salesman . " We was just out looking for him . " " Well , he must have changed his mind , " said Jayell . " He ca n't do that , " said Doc Bobo . " We had an agreement . I was to co-sign his note . " " The bank said he did n't need a co-signer . And I guess he figured he could do without your kickback and this guy 's rate of interest . " " We had an agreement , " repeated Doc Bobo angrily , " and it still stands . Ruben Johnson would n't do this to me  --  he 's indebted to me at the present time . " " I suspect a lot of people are . That has nothing to do with me . I 'm just building a house . " Doc Bobo looked over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of a drawbridge . Ruben 's young wife especially liked the drawbridge , Jayell said . When it was raised the house was safely isolated above the ground . Ruben moonlighted nights at the mill . " We do n't need your peculiar structures in the Ape Yard , Mr. Crooms . You make my people look ridiculous . A house on stilts ! Who wants a thing like that ? " " Anybody in this bottom would be glad to have it when that creek backs up next spring . And talk about peculiar structures ! " Jayell stood up and pointed . " From here I can see a whole hillside of what I 'd call very peculiar structures : roofs caving in , rotted porches , falling pillars  --  there 's one without even a door , just a burlap curtain ! You own some downright strange-looking houses yourself , Doc !  | Besides , my houses never seemed to bother you until that prefab crook started coming around with his kickbacks . Why do n't you quit sniffing the air for a new scheme and stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dob Bobo tugged on his hat and looked about the job . He walked over to the nearest group of shop boys and said something to them . They immediately dropped their tools and walked off the job . Jayell stepped to the edge of the roof and shook his hammer . " Quitting time is five o'clock ! " They quickened their pace down the red clay road . Doc Bobo turned to the others , and one by one they followed . Jayell whirled on Bobo in a rage . " You son of a bitch ! " He flung down a handful of roofing tacks and sprang for the ladder . A moment later I heard Jayell yell . Positioned against a circular roof , the ladder was not secure enough to bear Jayell 's weight thrown on it in a fit of anger . Once it started sliding there was nothing to grab hold of . Jayell came off the front of the house kicking away to jump free , but the momentum carried him and the ladder down an embankment into a pile of lumber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ! " cried Bobo . When we reached him he was pushing up on his elbow , blood streaming down his face . Doc Bobo tried to get an arm under his back . " No ! " gasped Jayell , " the leg , goddamnit , the leg ! " Then I saw the bone , white as a chicken 's bone , sticking out above his sock . His foot was wedged under some timbers and I tried frantically to pull them away . Clyde Fay bent silently to his work , lifting away the heavy timbers with ease . Jayell was a long time coming out from under the anesthetic . Gwen put her hand on his forehead . " How do you feel , darling ? " she said softly . " Fine , " he said groggily . After repeated efforts at shaking himself awake , he looked down at the leg . " Did they leave it on  --  or is that a dummy cast to cheer me up ? " " Sssh , just rest now . " " Give me a cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Would you like some water ? "  | " How 's a cigarette going to hurt my goddamned leg ? Give me a cigarette ! " Gwen groped nervously in her bag . She lit the smoke and Jayell took a deep drag . " Thank God it was the good leg , " he said sardonically , " would'a been a shame to bust up the one with all those rods and pins in it . They spent a lot of time rebuilding that baby . Got a whole erector set in there . Hey ! Maybe they shortened this one to match ! Earl , get my rule ! " " Sssh , Jayell , please . . . " " But I might not have a limp anymore . . " Jayell , stop it ! " " Stop ! Hell , I am stopped , woman . If there 's anything I am at this moment , it 's stopped ! " Gwen fumbled for the buzzer . A nurse put her head in the door . " He needs something , " Gwen said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need something , " Jayell said . " Early , you think you can find me a jar of stumphole ? " " You 'd better go , " said Gwen . It was more than a request . " Go to Dirsey , boy , tell him I want the rottenest stuff he 's got ! " " It 's all right , darling , " Gwen said soothingly , " it 's going to be all right now . Everything 's going to be just fine . "  | THAT NIGHT TIO CAME STRUGGLING UP THE GULLEY WITH A SLAB of fatback , some flour wrapped in newspaper , and a small jar of molasses . We fried the fatback and crumbled molasses in it and I sopped it with shards of the hoecake he made in the skillet . " Did you go by the hospital ? " I asked . " Yeah . " " How is he ? " " I did n't get to talk to him . They said he got to raisin ' so much hell the doctor had to knock him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " That house for Ruben Johnson was the only one he had too , and now with him laid up in the hospital . . . Hey ! I wonder if we could finish that house ! I could roundup Skeeter and Carlos and the shop boys and . . . " Tio held up his hand , listening . He got up and went to the window and then I heard it too , the sound of a siren turning in by the fairgrounds.  | " Well , you can forget that idea , " Tio said . It was a fire truck , roaring down the hollow toward a red glow over Fletcher Bottom . Tio shook his head . " I 'll bet everywhere that Bobo steps , he kills the grass . " I sat down at the table . " What 's coming next . . . " " I do n't guess you 've heard from Jojohn . Well , do n't you worry , old papa Tio wo n't let you starve . " And he kept his word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprouting potatoes , pigs knuckles , salt mackerel , and even a porkchop when he could snitch it . We both felt bad stealing from Mr. Teague , until we hit on the idea that Tio was just opening a secret account for me . We would keep a careful tally of everything he brought , and I would pay for it as soon as I was able . That relieved both our consciences , and when the stealing switched to simple debt , Tio started stealing a better class of goods . But other problems began cropping up , things I 'd never thought about before , such as laundry . At the boardinghouse my dirty clothes had always disappeared magically and turned up clean in the drawers . Now they just piled up in the corner and lay there . I tried putting them in the washtub and stomping around on them while I bathed , and tying bricks in the legs of my jeans to pull out the wrinkles while they hung from the limbs to dry . That worked fairly well for the jeans , but my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called me aside one day at school . " Earl , " she said , " you 've got to do something ! " Finally Tio brought me an old iron without a cord he had traded off of somebody , and I heated it on the stove and destroyed my one white shirt with it . It was the infernal bleaching . I remembered Farette putting in Clorox with the whites , and I did that . What I did n't remember was the careful rinsing , and made do with a swish and a wring . When I put the iron to it , it developed large brown holes and the collar came loose at one end . " For God 's sake , " cried Tio , " get what clothes you got left and let 's take ' em to Grandma Tyne ! " " What 'll I pay her with ? " " We 'll think of something . But you go through another washday , you gon ' be naked ! "  | Grandma Tyne was a knotty little black woman in a red-roofed house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porch rail . As usual she was on the back porch prodding in her old wringer machine with a boiled white stick , suds and bluing soaking through the floor boards and foaming off into the garden . " Got your list of what you want from the store this week , Grandma ? " Tio asked . Grandma Tyne poked a ballooning overalls pocket under the rinse water and pursed her lips . " Better bring me some flour , a bag of dry beans  --  do n't matter what kind  --  navy 's all right . Need a can'a lard , some Peach snuff . . . " " Wait a minute . " Tio took his pencil out of his pocket and rum- . maged in her safe until he found a piece of paper bag . He looked in the oven and got us each a sausage biscuit from the pan she always kept there , and sat down at the table . " Wish you 'd make a list , " he said . Grandma Tyne rapped the suds off her stick and stuck it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write , Mr. Smarty Britches , and I will . " He clamped the sausage biscuit between his teeth and noted down the items as she called them off . When he was done he folded the paper and stuck it in his pocket . " Want to pay a little sump'n on your account this week ? " " Do n't you come at me with none o ' your mess , boy . Ai n't I keepin ' up that bill with y'all 's washin ' ? " Tio winked at me . " Not with me keepin ' the books nowadays . You just keep gettin ' further and further behind . " " Shoot ! " Grandma stabbed in her machine . " If I could buy you for what you 're worth and sell you for what you think you 're worth , I 'd be done retired ! " " Listen at that , " Tio said , " and me comin ' here bringin ' her another customer . Earl 's by hisself now , Grandma , and if he keeps washin ' his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em in a bag to hang ' em up . " " Sho ' , I 'll do your wash , honey , " she said . " That them there ? Bring ' em hyeah . " " I have n't got any money , Grandma , " I said . " Maybe I could do some chores or something ? "  | " Just run ' em in with ours and we 'll put it on the groceries , " Tio said . " Sho  --  sho  --  that 'll be fine , " she said , " and I can always use a little coal . You get you a bucket and look along the tracks where the coal cars unload , " she told me , " and pick me up a little coal from time to time . " " I 'll do that , " I said . " Lawd , " she said , " I wish ever'body could make do without money . But the light comp'ny and that insurance  --  they want the money . Doc Bobo says he ca n't carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I du n no where . " " Ca n't carry you for what ? " I asked . " My burial insurance , honey , " she said proudly . " You 've got burial insurance with Doc Bobo ? " " One thousand dollars ' worth . Ai n't lettin ' the county put me in no hole out yonder behind the prison camp where nobody ca n't find my grave . Gon ' have me a nice funeral , with flowers  --  just lots of flowers . " " You ready ? " Tio said to me . I sopped the last smear of sausage grease off the oilcloth and folded the remains of the biscuit into my mouth . " You be sure and make that payment now , Grandma , " he said , " ' cause me and Doc Bobo done got it figured that when you kick off I 'm gon na hide the body and we gon ' split the thousand dollars . " He made a jump for the porch but she caught him behind the neck with a sopping shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance , laughing and shaking his collar . Still , I had to have money , and the next day after school I started combing the town for work . It was to be one of the bitterest experiences of my life . The classified ads turned up nothing , as did the state employment office . I went to Bobo 's mill , to the quarries , the sheds , the gas stations , and found everywhere that the state was protecting me from serious employment because of my age . After trying all the stores at Galaxy Plaza , I started on the north side of the square and made a canvass of the entire town : the hardware store , poolroom , department stores , the bank , the dry cleaning plant , the drugstore , the bottling plant  --  even the fire station and courthouse . I walked in every place that had a public entrance , and  | asked if they had any kind of a job for a boy . Some were polite and took up time , others simply shook their heads or waved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new bowling alley for a pin boy , but when I applied , the manager took me aside and explained that what he needed was another colored boy . At the telephone office I thought I was on to something . A lady in cat-eye glasses with pearly rims handed me an application form and questioned me lengthily about my possibilities as a lineman . It went on and on , and I grew more excited by the minute  --  then the lady broke . There was other laughter , and then I saw a group of linemen crowded in the door of the day room , spilling their coffee . A secretary put her head down on her desk . In the circus , I 'm told , chimps have an instinctive hatred for the exaggerated smiles of clowns , and will attack on sight . For me , it 's those cat-eye glasses with the pearly rims . I 've never been able to overcome it . Panic was beginning to set in . I saw the boarders from time to time ; Mrs. Bell had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising general hell about my defection and demanding to know how I was getting on , but I always put up a big front and tried not to let any of them discover the truth . Tio continued to drop off food , but I saw less and less of him as he and Mr. Teague became engaged in a massive remodeling of the store . Mr. Teague had finally given in , and they were going to turn it into a regular supermarket , Tio said . He was scouting the Valley Farm store like an enemy agent , noting every facet of its operation . Finally I decided to go and have a talk with Jayell , who had been moved back to the house in Marble Park . Admittedly , he was a poor prospect for practical advice , but he was the only one I had . I waited until an afternoon when I knew Gwen was at a faculty meeting , so that at least I could avoid seeing her . One of the reasons I had taken Tio 's advice and reported back to school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in a couple of weeks , was because I wanted to finish the eighth grade and get shed of that woman altogether . " Welcome in , come in ! " Jayell was sitting at the fireplace , cracking pecans on the hearth with his cast . He racked around in his chair to look at me with bleary eyes , and went back to shelling nuts . I knew it was useless . Jayell 's spirit had been at low ebb ever since the accident . The bank had  | repossessed some of his equipment , refusing even to talk to him about an extension . They were living on Gwen 's salary , which was barely enough to meet household expenses and the mortgage payments on the lot , and now had somehow to cope with the enormous medical bills . Jayell had bought accident insurance , he was certain of it ; and sure enough , , the box under his bed turned up policies protecting him against just about every possible catastrophe that could befall a man , but the half-dozen that still happened to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Smithbilt homes had stopped by several times to renew his offer of work when Jayell was able to get about again , and Gwen frankly saw no other way out . Jayell refused to talk about it ? or anything else , for that matter . He sat brooding in the house at Marble Park , except for those times Carlos and Skeeter would come and lift him into the truck and take him to Dirsey 's to get blind , falling-down drunk . He was n't even drawing anymore . Jayell sighed and threw a handful of shells into the fireplace . " Everything can go to hell overnight , ca n't it , Early boy ? " He raised his head and looked at me . " How old are you now ? " " Fourteen . " He thought about it . " Well , you got a hard row to hoe , but you 'll get by . I was fifteen when I got ' fed up with the old man and left home . You 're young , and you 're a little backward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you got to remember now is that you 've got all the responsibilities of an adult , but none of the rights . Legally , you ca n't get credit , sign a contract , or even rent a post office box . People may do business with you , but if they cheat you there 's nothing you can do about it , because no paper you sign will be legal . And they will cheat you , believe me , they 'll overcharge you , they 'll outbargain you , they 'll take every advantage your lack of experience gives ' em , ' cause that 's the way business operates , and it makes no allowance for age . In business as in everything else in this lovely world , the weak and the helpless are eaten first . Above all , " he said . emphatically , " do n't you get in trouble of any kind . Do n't even let the law know you 're alive . " " Why ? " " ' Cause for you , even hookey from school is a crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous to see a kid running around loose , and any chance they get , they 'll put you away . Stay low , stay  | quiet , be respectful but firm where money is concerned , and when you get the short end , consider it tuition and try not to repeat the course . Anything else I can do to cheer you up ? " " Not unless you can tell me where I can find a job . " Jayell brought down the heel of his cast too hard and bent over , picking meat from among the shell fragments . " You 're asking the wrong person . I could n't even get a job as a nutcracker . No , Earl , you 've got it all against you , " he said bitterly , " you 're not even old enough to get married , so you could live off your wife . " " Jayell , what about you , you given up your dream ? You not going to build anymore ? " Jayell gritted his teeth . " Dreams , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembering that . Have it , taste it , and let it go . To expect it to last is only to invite hell on earth . " " I do n't understand . " " When you 've lived long enough , you will . Jojohn , " he nodded . " He knows what it 's all about . He keeps it all in his head , where it belongs . Would n't see him go building no houses ! " " But  --  I thought it was Jojohn who told you to build ' em . . . " " Oh , he did . But it was a suggestion of the moment , do n't you see ? Jojohn lives for the moment he 's in , and lets the rest slide by . Hell , it would n't occur to him to worry about the future ! He said build ' cm ; it did n't bother him whether the dream would last . It 's fools like me who try for permanence . Jojohn 's always gone before the echoes die ! " " Echoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair , his hooded eyes burning . " Earl , man is a freak in this world . Look at all the other animals  --  those dumb , plodding creatures , every damned one as much a part of the total order as the seasons . They reproduce , they die , and that 's that . No hope of heaven . No sad songs . That 's how we should be . " Only in man something went wrong . We understand more than we should , we have wills , we have imaginations and , God save us , fantasies of love and joy , knowing  --  knowing that every bit of it ends when our hones are put in the earth ! Do n't you see how much it 's against the Divine grain , the natural order of things ? It 's like there was some huge shirtin ' mistake ! ' Hut , of course , I know there has n't been any mistake . So , so you  | know what I think ? " Jayell hunched forward , scruffing his chair on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the hell of the angels . That maybe we 're creatures with angels exiled in our souls , banished to this godawful existence , crying in despair . . . " " Jayell , I came here to feel better . . . I do n't need to hear anything like . . . " " . . . and all those fancy frigging dreams we have are only the cries of those poor old angels , their screams in our animal minds . " I jumped to my feet . " I 'm not gon na stay and listen to such nonsense as that . . . I never heard such as that in any church I ever went to ! And you call yourself a religious man ! " " Earl , has n't it been the dream of religious man for all time  --  to release the angel in his soul when he dies  --  and know real peace , at last ? " " I do n't know how you can believe such a thing . " Jayell sighed . He leaned his head back against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initials that his mother had made , and that he had brought up from the shop . " It 's only a thought and , oh Lordy , I hope I 'm wrong . But that 's the trouble with an honest mind , " he said sadly , " it takes you so many places you do n't want to go . " I rushed out and left him there . On the porch I saw a blue car coasting to a stop on the dirt road in the woods next to the house . Phaedra Boggs got out . She called out to me , saying something I did n't bother to hear . She stood watching me as I crossed the yard and broke into a run down the road . I walked the streets and around the square , Jayell 's words pounding , the feeling of desperation building . The summer streets were filled with young people . They sat on fenders at the drugstore and shouted to those passing in hot rods , they sprang along twirling tennis rackets , bicycled past with bathing suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not a worry in the world , performing to the hilt their role in the golden , carefree pageant that youth was supposed to be . And here I was , moving through them without so much as drawing a glance , heading back for the Ape Yard , where I was , in truth , as much a stranger . I lay on the cot in the loft , hours passed , it began to grow dark . A  | hot metallic taste burned at the back of my throat . Was I ready to take responsibility for this creature named Earl Whitaker , to do his thinking for him ? In our readings on the porch , Gwen had quoted a writer named Steinbeck as saying a boy gets to be a man when a man is needed . A man was needed now , desperately needed . But it was so hard to give up being a boy . I wanted so much to stay a little longer in that golden time . I lay on the cot in the fading light and begged for it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , ominously , something started to happen . The subtle nausea . The light throwing faint , wavering shades of green . The old symptoms of that night at Miss Esther 's when things had become more than I could stand , and I had to go to the hospital . From out of the wood 's drone I heard the mumbling voice of Dr. Weisner . . . " No ! " I screamed . It could not happen again ! Suddenly I was on my feet , throwing everything I could lift at the walls , screaming at the top of my voice . I kicked over the cot , the footlocker  --  the frustration turning to anger , feeding on itself . I knocked down the makeshift ironing plank and swept everything from the shelves . I smashed the tin stove apart and fell on it , kicking and beating it into a twisted mass of metal . It was dark . I stood in the wreckage of the loft , sweat pouring off of me . I wiped away and turned and saw in the mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands were bleeding . I threw open the door and sprang down the steps and raced out across the sedgefield . Down below the field stood the dark wall of the woods , waiting . I could n't stop . I would n't let myself stop . The old terror swelled up in me , I felt a hush , things were gathering , watching . Something skittered through the underbrush , something that could n't contain itself , ( lancing with maniacal glee . Limbs waved as they scampered aloft . The woods loomed above me , stretching its darkened maw . I threw myself forward into it . I ran off that moonlit field and into the woods , and all the breath I had left came out in one hoarse , throatscalding cry . I thrashed through the underbrush like a demon hound , incoherent sounds ripping out of me , searching them out among the shadows , charging hushes where things might hide , falling and rolling and getting  | up to charge again . I fought through the night of the woods , screaming out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gulley and , kicking through briars and entangling vines , I clambered down its length until it opened out on flat ground . I ran around trees , clapping my hands , shouting , barking , howling with triumphant glee . I stumbled out into another field , and below me the walls of the old swimming quarry shone gray in the moonlight , the great hole black and foreboding . And I was running toward it . There was a dizziness , my legs grew numb . . . " . . . when you 're the most scared , Early boy . . I hit the edge running , and dived . There was a long , terrifying moment of weightlessness , of floating stomach and flashing granite walls , the shock of contact and then the surfacing in the streaming cold , my own jubilant cries mingling with the echoes of splashing water ringing off the darkened walls . I threw back my head and fought the water with furious strokes , the night clouds rolling overhead . At the other end of the quarry I pulled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath , I let them wash over me , the old dark visions , the uncertain , unnamed feelings I had so persistently pushed away . I would have no more of fear . No more of the old , vague terrors that had haunted me so long . If those unseen monsters stood at the edge of the woods I would welcome their faces now , to have a chance with my hands at their throats . Fear was a twisted disease of childhood , to have and be rid of , like the mumps . I would not carry it any longer . And if adulthood was another nightmare of the unseen , unknown , with no certainty out there but death , so be it . I would live on the moment , like Jojohn . I would belong to me . I arose and started for home , slopping soaking wet through the once forbidding , reaching , night woods , slapping at the leaves . Cornering by the Simmons place , I heard a dog barking . Vicious . Frantic . The squeaking of wire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waving his arms and howling back at the dog .  | " LEAVE ME ALONE ! GET AWAY , YOU HEAR ME ? GET YOUR HANDS off me ! " In the loft , I wrestled him into the makeshift bathroom , dodging his flailing elbows . He fell heavily against the tin wall , shooting out cracks in the enamel , and he glared at me through a grotesque black mask of shoe polish . " What did you come back for ? " " I might ask you the same thing . " I tried to unbutton his shirt and hr pushed me away . I slapped his hands aside and he pushed me away again , then ripped off his shirt in drunken disgust and threw it at me . He slid to the floor and sat there , wheezing , his shoulders jerking in a turbulent rhythm . The flesh sagged heavily on his massive chest . " I ai n't lookin ' after you . Do n't come expectin ' me to . . . " Who the hell asked you to look after me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to live , and it did n't matter to me if I never saw your ugly face again ! " I soaked the torn shirt in a bucket and dusted it with washing powder and scrubbed his face . He grumbled and turned aside , and  | I jerked him back by the hair and bore down harder . He watched me through slitted eyes turning red from the strong soap . " Damned ole animal , " I said , " who could think they ever had a need of you . " When his face had come through the shoe polish and there remained only the black lines in the creases of his skin , I emptied the bucket of water over his head . He sat glowering as it matted his hair and ran in dirty rivulets down his chest , soaking the floor and pouring off onto the dirt floor of the garage . " Ai n't you something , laying out in those river joints like an old dog , lettin ' people play tricks on you and make a fool of you , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look after me ! Let me tell you something , Jojohn , I 'd spend the rest of my life on my knees begging crumbs at Vance Cahill 's table before I 'd ask a minute of your time ! I do n't need you for anything , and I do n't expect ever to need you for anything ; so far as I 'm concerned you can crawl back down that river and stay gone ! " I threw the bucket against the wall and left the room . Tio came with a bag of groceries ; he looked at the demolished loft but said nothing , knowing after a while Em was back . Em came staggering up the steps . He sat at the table in drunken silence while I ate supper . After a while he started munching on the Mary Jane candy Tio had brought . He sat glumly chewing , wrappers and all , spitting an occasional piece of paper from his teeth . I ignored him . Finally Tio started unwrapping them for him . " Well , I 'd a swore we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Em sat staring ahead . " Ai n't no use , " he said . " In what ? " " Tryin ' . " Tio looked at me . " Tryin ' what ? " Em was silent a moment . Finally he sighed , " Pore little puppy . " " Puppy ? " Tio looked from Em to me . " What puppy ? " Em 's voice began to quiver . " Little beagle puppy I found on the highway yesterday . He 'd been run over , and there he was , draggin ' hisself along on his little front legs . " Em rubbed his nose . " I did n't know what to do for him  --  he was tryin ' so hard  --  did n't know what 'd happened to him . Should'a put him outa his misery . Knowed I should . But I could n't bring myself . I said , Little dog , ai n't no use in you and me tryin ' . . . " His voice broke . " Then what happened ? " Tio said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just stood over him so he would n't git hit again . " He shook his head sadly . " Took more'n an hour for him to die . " " And you just stood there in the middle of the road , " I said . " Should'a put him out of his misery , " Em said again . " I 've drowned cats . Once when the mama bitch died I had to shotgun a whole pile of puppies . But this time , I just could n't do it . I do n't know what 's happenin ' to me . " He choked up . The tears rolled down his cheeks . Tio picked up a piece of candy and stuck it in his jaw . " So you just stood there in the middle of the road , with the cars going by , and grieved over that dog . " " Over him , and me , " Em gasped . " ' Cause it could have been me . Someday I 'll die like that , with nobody around to grieve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us tryin ' to get along down the road , and gettin ' hit by sump'n too big to understand , and we do n't know why . " Tio looked at Em and at me . He shook his head and unwrapped another Mary Jane . " Beats all , " he said , " settin ' here grievin ' his own death . " Em grabbed the candy from Tio 's hand . " You DO N'T KNOW NOTHIN ' AND YOU NEVER WILL , SO WHAT YOU DOIN ' COMIN ' AROUND BOTHERIN ' A BEREAVED PERSON AND EATIN ' UP HIS MARY JANES ! GET THE HELL OUTA HERE ! " Em went to the sink and picked up the water bucket and poured it over his face and head . He tilted his head back , drinking the last of the water . He slammed down the empty bucket and something caught his eye . He leaned forward and looked into the piece of broken mirror on the wall . " What happened h'yere ? " He pulled at the blackened lines around his eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " THEY DONE WHAT ! " " You must have passed out at one of those joints on the river . Probably Birdsong 's . When are you going to learn to stay out of those trashy places . " They were always playing tricks on Em at Birdsong 's . They never could decide whether he was black or not . I wished many times the sheriff could close that gambling-moonshine joint for good .  | Em 's chest heaved with building anger . " Birdsong 's . " He gritted his teeth in a bitter grin . " That 's what I needed . " Tio turned to leave . " I 'll see you later . " " Where you goin ' ? " Em demanded . " Home . " " Naw , " said Em , jamming his hat on his head and grabbing Tio by the arm , " you come with me , " and he hauled him out of the door . Birdsong 's , a small shack of a fish camp that stood on wooden pilings over the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came down the river road . The wooded parking lot was jammed with cars , and several outboards were tied up at the dock . Lew Birdsong was sitting at a game of poker when Em heaved in at the door . Someone at the bar called out , " Hey , Chief Blackface is back among us ! " And laughter swelled around the room . Em seized Tio by the collar and marched him up to Birdsong 's table . " You see this here , Birdsong ? This is a nigger  --  what you tried to make me appear like . He is what he is , and I am what I am , and it 's important to both of us that you know the difference . " " Do your war dance for him , Indian ! " The fellow on Birdsong 's left gathered a handful of beer bottles and shoved them across the table . Lew Birdsong grinned and leaned back to scratch his chest . " Well , you got to understand , we did n't have no red shoe polish . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd of made an effort to get some . " That was followed by another round of laughter . " Do your war dance , go on , show ' em , " insisted the other fellow . He shoved the bottles again and one tipped over , pouring beer down the Indian 's leg . Em looked down at the puddle of foam dripping off the toe of his boot . " Uh-huh , " he mumbled deep down , and grabbing the man by the neck , he plucked him from the chair . Back-stepping quickly toward the door , he gave a sideways turn and the man went over the porch rail with a startled yell that ended with a splash in the river . Men were pushing up from everywhere . Em stood laughing , smacking his palm with his fist . Two men came at him and he wiped them down with a chair . Then he was at Birdsong 's table , and as they started to rise he bounced them away from his fists as though he was shooting pool . The proprietor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Tio and we dived under a table . Somebody stepped on my hand and Tio helped me kick him off . It was a running jumble of legs and breaking furniture and the Indian 's laughter . Somebody went through a window . A lot of the customers were clearing out . I heard cars and outboards cranking . Birdsong 's was not popular with the law . But there were others , Birdsong 's regulars , who ran liquor for him , who were obliged to stay and put up a show . They circled and clubbed at the Indian , tried to get behind him . One of them did and got hurled headlong into the bar . A man wrapped himself around Em 's legs , trying to trip him up ; Em gripped the man 's head between his knees while he knocked two more away , then freed the fellow 's head with a piledriver fist . The bartender , a short , stocky fellow , ran down the counter and jumped on Em 's shoulders and lifted a bat . Em laughed and dived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tio could n't stand it any longer . He ducked behind the bar and dealt a man a glancing blow to the head with a bottle . The man swore and gave chase and Tio crawled into a lower cabinet . But the man got it open and as he was dragging Tio out by the heels I tackled him from the rear . He turned in a rage and , grabbing me by the shirt , was lifting his fist when Tio 's foot rose hard between his legs . The man froze in pain . " Heah now ! " Em had seen the man ready to strike and reached and snatched him across the counter , but when he saw the pale face before him and the man hanging limp with pain , he dropped him to the floor in puzzlement . Em shook his head and downed a swallow from one of the bottles on the counter . " Damndest thing I ever saw . " The floor was piled with bodies . Some crawled in pain . A skinny backwoodsman sat holding the two halves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could tell . " All right , git moving now . " Em walked around the room , shaking them awake , prodding the crawlers with his foot . " Clear out or drown .. , " Come on , Em , let 's get out of here , " I said . " Ai n't done yit , " said Em . " Come on , git up there , now ! " He began dragging the crumpled forms out the door . " Em , what are you doing ? "  | " I 'm sick and tired of this place . Ever ' time I 've come here they 've cheated me , ridiculed me , and served me bad liquor . I 'm fed up . " When the last of them were dumped in the parking lot , Em rummaged around in the shed and came out with an ax . " Em , are you crazy ? " I tried to get it away from him but he brushed me aside . The man Em had thrown in the river was crawling up the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the shack . Tio and I watched in disbelief as he climbed down to the boat dock and started chopping away at the pilings . He worked through the first line , then crawled in a skiff and pushed under the shack , and , wedging himself steady with a brace of oars , set to work on the others . The flimsy building began to settle down over him . " Em , get out from under there ! " When the building began to lean down toward the water he came pushing out , climbed the bank , and ran out onto the porch and jumped up and down , furious at its slowness . " Slide , damn you , slide ! " With a popping of joists the old shack shifted , the porch was almost touching the water . " Get off there , Em ! " He lumbered along the porch , jumping , grabbing supports and leaning out over the water , shouting at it to move . When the boat dock was under water he lunged up the boardwalk , found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house and got his shoulder under it . The Indian 's moans piercing the night , inch by inch the building tilted , lower and lower , until the current got a grip on the porch . There was an enormous crash and slide of furniture and glass falling about inside . Then a rush of water and a sigh as the shack slid off the bank . It bobbed there in the stream , a big black thing of peculiar shape , shifting , twisting a little downstream , leaving stubs of pillars where it sat ; power lines snapped and lay on the ground . Cars were cranking and driving away . Lew Birdsong sat propped on his hands , looking dazedly around . He was still sitting that way , looking around for his fish camp , when we lost sight of him through the trees .  | FEELING BETTER , EM DECIDED HE WANTED A BATH , AND SAT BY THE well singing softly to himself . I poured bucket after bucket of water over him and told him all that had happened , the cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper lay on his lip . He sat sniffing and humming that wordless song as he watched the dawn drift in from the woods . " Not a thing to worry about , " he said , pulling on his clothes . " We 'll make out just fine . Damn , I 'm hungry ! " He walked up to pay his respects to the boarders ( returning with a lard pail filled with hot food ) , and went out to see Jayell , and spent the next few days cleaning attics , basements , and doing whatever odd jobs he could turn up while I was in school . one day a lady whose Florida room he helped redo gave him an aquarium of tropical fish , with which he was delighted . He set it in the window and showed me how the sun striking the corner of the tank just right threw a lavish spectrum of colors across the wall . But all my arguing could n't save the fish . He fried them up crispy brown and ate them on Ritz crackers .  | Pets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him ! I do n't know what he told the boarders about our condition when he went up there to see them that first day home  --  he swore he told them nothing  --  but he must have done some very broad hinting , because pretty soon they started having Mr. Teague , Tio , Em and me up to the house for Saturday night suppers . " To help keep the food bill equal to what we 're being charged for ! " said Mrs. Porter . And , they said , they wanted a chance to pump Mr. Teague in detail about all that was going on at the store . The boarders themselves , surprisingly , were doing remarkably well . Far from the collapse of spirit I expected when Miss Esther left , there was an activity around the house I had never seen before . They all turned out for yard work now , even Mr. Jurgen . The women were busy making quilts ; they were doing some babysitting for members of Pinnacle church . Mr. Rampey and Mr. Woodall ventured down to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trooping off to Sunday services together  --  even Mr. Burroughs . Those Saturday night suppers were among the best times I ever had , a riot of reminiscing , with each of them outdoing the other in telling tall tales , often , as was their custom , with two or three of them going at it at the same time . And it was the first of these get-togethers that brought Farette 's situation into the open at the boardinghouse and forced the boarders to face it , and make a decision . And having done that , they laid the groundwork for what came later . Farette was about the same age as the boarders , and although she protected her position as official cook and housekeeper with a sharp tongue and a watchful eye , over the years the work had plainly become too much for her to do alone , and it had become natural for Miss Esther and the others to help out in the kitchen at mealtimes and wash the dishes afterward , to take turns with the washing and ironing and general cleaning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person living in the house  --  except for two notable differences . One was that she still attended Free Rent A.M.E. church in the hollow while the others walked uptown  --  which I never thought much about ; A.M.E. was closer , and Em and I preferred it to Pinnacle Baptist ourselves . The other , to which I had given a great deal of thought over the  | years , was that while I was confined to the thunder and roar of mealtimes in the dining room , Farette got to eat by herself in the serenity of the kitchen . The privacy , our invitations to supper cost her . Tio and I were sitting on the front porch that first night , flipping a little mumbletypeg with our knives and listening to the men 's voices in the living room as we waited for supper , and when those wonderful words , " Y'all ' bout ready ? " came from the dining room in Farette 's clarion voice , there was a general scramble in that direction . As we passed through the living room Mr. Teague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making to Mr. Rampey . " The way we rearranged the shelves and the meat cases , how much floor space was it that we added to the store ? " " A hundred and twenty square feet , " said Tio . " A hundred and twenty square feet , " said Mr. Teague proudly . " Plus that do n't count the extra shelves we built up front , " said Tio , " and when you figure we pyramid the canned goods now like they do , two four-foot squares  --  and that 's extra , that was just walkin ' space before , let 's see that comes to . . . " During this time they had walked into the dining room where the others were already taking their usual places , and Tio , calculating rapidly on his fingers , sat down opposite Mr. Teague , just as he was accustomed to doing at home . " In all it comes to two hundred and thirty-eight . . . " Tio came to in the hush . What had stopped the talk was Farette , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravy boat , stood frozen , staring at him . Then the others turned to look , and Tio , his eyes widening in horror , scrambled to his feet . tlp to that moment , no one had given a thought to Tio 's presence , and now everyone was as dumfounded as Tio himself , who , unable to move or think , stood gripping the back of his chair . It was awful . No one could think what to do . And it was into that desperate silence that Mr. Burroughs , late to the table as usual , came harrumphing and clearing his throat from the bathroom . Ile swung through the door and stopped , focusing on what all the quiet was about . And when he perceived it he stood surveying it ,  | the way he might a stalled car , his white moustache working . He looked at Tio . He looked at Farette . At last he stepped forward , lowered his long arms until his knuckles rested on the table , and roared : " Oh-what-the-hell . . . ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a lot of balloons ; all the tension at once rose to laughter . Mr. Rampey and Mrs. Bell grabbed Tio and pulled him into his chair . " Farette ! " cried Mrs. Metcalf , and she and Mrs. Porter and Mr. Burroughs all grabbed the frightened little woman at once . Mrs. Cline tottered to the kitchen for her plate . Laughing with the others at her discomfort , I jumped up and ran for an extra chair . When she was finally seated , I leaned across to her and said , " You did n't think you 'd get away with it forever , did you ? " But she was up to it . She carefully removed and folded her apron in her lap and , sitting stiff as a ramrod , pinched her lips and looked slowly around at all the grinning faces . Finally she snapped , " Well ? Ai n't nobody at this table gon ' ax a blessin ' ! " But we could n't live on that one meal a week . We cast about for every possible source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found an offer to become solvent in my spare time by selling religious mottoes . It struck me that I could do worse than throwing in with Providence on a get-rich scheme , as there was bound to be a little supernatural help in the selling of such a product . I would even tithe a tenth of the profits as an added guarantee . I had heard positive-thinking businessmen testify at Pinnacle Baptist that they owed their entire success to the practice . The mottoes were verses of Scripture written in glitter on an electric blue background that sold for a quarter apiece . Sure enough , Providence held up its end of the deal . They sold like hotcakes , especially in the Ape Yard . In fact , I was surprised to find that the poorest shanties housed the best prospects . When they were all sold I had collected a little over eight dollars , and a blue coating on my fingers that would take time to wear off . But then I found myself in a moral dilemma . With the money before me on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tithing . It seemed a reckless commitment to a  | " silent partner " who had remained altogether too silent when the doors were slamming . I stewed about it . I even offered Him a chance to speak up , right then and there , and clear away my doubts once and for all . It 's not often a person gets to pray while holding the trump card , and it gave me a glorious sense of power . All right , I said , stay silent this time and it 's going to cost you something . I waited , but He did n't take the bait . Still , I was uneasy . Then I hit on what seemed to me a brilliant solution : I simply opened an account with Providence as I had with Mr. Teague ! In the end I kept the company 's share too . I got several threatening letters about an inspector-somebody who was in my area and would see that I got prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law if I did n't remit the company 's money at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuff , I was n't about to be intimidated by some mail-order house in New Jersey . With my new wealth I paid three dollars on account to Tio , bought a new pair of tennis shoes , chipped in on another secondhand trash burner to replace the one I 'd smashed ( " What in the world happened up here ? " Em had asked . " I got mad , " I said . " Well , next time you feel a mad comin ' on , holler , so I can guy off the building ! " ) , treated Em to a Saturday at the picture show with a box of chocolate-covered cherries , and brought home milkshakes for breakfast . The next morning I was still sick from the candy , and endured Em 's snickers as I poured the curdled milkshakes out the window . That was foolish , I thought . I would have to guard against such childish splurges in the future . Suddenly I became very fearful for our money , and insisted that we keep it in a safe place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the garage . I worked it loose from its U-clamps and pulled it into the loft . Prying off the top of the birdhouse , I found that my coffee-can bank would just fit snugly inside . I put our money in it , replaced the top , and slid the pole back in the clamps . The birds would have to look to themselves . Flushed with the success of the motto business , I next sent off for garden seeds to sell , failing to note that agriculture , unlike religion , is seasonal , and most people already had gardens producing . After a few days I shelved my sales , kit and gave up . Then Em saw it , and I wished many times over I had burned it .  | " That 's what we ought to do , " he cried , " plant us a late vegetable garden ! Lord , how long has it been since I 've tasted fresh vegetables right out of the ground ! " I 'd seen it happen many times . Once a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground , he can no longer be dealt with as a rational human being . He is a person obsessed . You can kill him , but you ca n't talk him out of it . He will find soil to plant in if he has to haul it ; he will plant on solid rock , in clayey yards , on rooftops , in windowboxes , in cans , in paper cups , wherever a seed can put down roots and push a bud into the sun . I 'd known people who would change their religion before they would see a spring come without breaking ground . It is a curious malady , and can strike suddenly and without warning , even after , as in Em 's case , lying dormant for many years . The old lust came up in him that night , and the next morning before daybreak there he was out beside the garage ripping with a pick , dropping great clots of grass , the " hah ! hah ! " of his breath matching the slamming strokes . I trudged along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm , something telling me that I was in for a trying time . " Dig deep , boy , them roots got ta have room to grow ! " When the ground was broken he sifted it , worried , and grabbed a sack from the garage and headed for the woods . " We got ta get some woods dirt to mix in . " " You 're gon na haul more dirt ? We got a whole planet under there ! What do we need more dirt for ? " " Shut up and come on ! " he explained . After the area had been crawled over and picked free of every sprig it housed , Em permitted the planting to begin  --  and was even more impossible about that . If a package said three seeds to the hill , he put in five , just to be safe . I stuck the onion bulbs in too deep ; he yelled I was choking them , and fell on his knees and brushed away dirt as though they were , indeed , gasping for air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cups , as the roots were already growing through , and got damned for being the ignorantest fool , by far , he ever met . " Just stand over there , " he huffed in exasperation , " you 're gon na mess up in spite a all I can  | do ! " So I took to the shade , gratefully , picked my blisters and let him go . And he kept at it , from morning till night . " It 's a nice garden , a fine garden , " I ventured after a few days . " I hope Mrs. Bell does n't come down to retrieve a few of the tools you 've stolen from her and see it , because I 'm sure the shock and envy would be more than the poor woman could stand . But , Em , until that plot of ground actually starts growing something , we got to figure some way to put some food on the table . " Em stood leaning on his rake . " I been thinkin ' about it ! " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden and leaned down to free it of its troubles . " Doin ' this kind of work clears a man 's head so he can think ! Ai n't a thing to worry about , boy . You get out of school tomorrow ; the next day we 'll just head for Cooper Corner . "  | COOPER CORNER WAS A SHADED , WINDSWEPT CORNER UP NEAR THE fairgrounds , the gathering place for day laborers from the Ape Yard . We settled ourselves under the umbrella oak and waited , and for a while it seemed no one else was coming . Then , with the first gray tinting of the air they began emerging from the shadows of the hollow . They drifted up the winding paths and settled around us with a rustle of crusted work clothes , the soft scrapings of leather . They all looked tired and sleepy , and smelled of the sweat of yesterdays in the sun . " Good mornin ' , " bellowed Em cheerfully . Most of them knew him and returned the greeting with easy familiarity . Old Aaron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spreading it on his dried , cracked lips , shook his head and chuckled . " Come to do a little work , Em ? " " We come to work , me and this grown man h'yere , " said Em , and went over to engage the younger boys in a game of searching for echoes , their voices bouncing back from the darkened hollow .  | They were an elite corps , those morning hopefuls of Cooper Corner . They came each morning , sometimes whole families , and sat on the roots of the massive oak , on the curb , on the ground , and waited , sometimes all day . They came to pick cotton , to pull corn , to bale hay . They were there to spread asphalt , to dig ditches , to move furniture , to lay pipe and tend yard . They strung fences , killed hogs , trimmed trees ; they cleaned basements , unloaded freight cars , and climbed shivering cold from their drafty shacks to fire the furnaces for the waking town . Whatever work there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one goal each day : to put something on the table that night . With the grown ones came the young apprentices , some barely walking , to learn a trade in which there was no promotion , and the pay was always the least they would take . After a while a pickup puttered to the curb with milk cans rattling in the back . A farmer in a sun helmet bawled out , " Need two hands to roof a barn . " None of the black people moved , apparently in deference to us , who were first . Em looked about , and seeing this , stood up and dusted his pants . The farmer looked us over . " What'chall doin ' out here ? " " Lookin ' for work , " Em said . " Bet I can get some of these niggers to work cheaper . " " Then get ' em , " Em said , " but do n't go trying to bluff me down on price before we 've even talked work . " " Well , I suppose it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you handling that tin . Get in . " He looked at me . " Do n't need no kids . " " He goes where I go . He works like a man , and if he falls behind I 'll catch him up . " The farmer shifted gears . " I 'll take your word on that . " Em and I climbed in the back of the truck , but as we started off Em banged on the roof of the cab . The farmer slammed on the brakes . " You never said what you was payin ' . " " Seventy-five cents an hour for you , fifty for the kid . " " That the goin ' rate ? " Em called to the crowd . Someone down front nodded . Em shook his head and settled himself in the truck . " Drive on , " he said . The farmer , whose name was Hutchinson , ran a small dairy five miles out the Little Holland highway . Four men were already at  | work , hammering down the corrugated sheathing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below an enormous poultry house where hundreds of leghorns clucked and shuffled behind the latticed walls . Over the hill came the deep-throated throb of a tractor . Our job was to haul the roofing from stacks by the farmhouse and drag it up swaying ladders to the men on the roof . Hutchinson furnished no gloves , and in minutes the skin was fuzzed between our thumbs and forefingers and angry red cracks opened in our hands . Hutchinson stayed with us the whole time , shouting instructions to the carpenters and stamping about impatiently as we worked the tin up the ladders . He seemed to grow more agitated with each trip I made up the hill . " You said he could do a man 's work , " he shouted up at Em . " He is doing a man 's work , " Em shot back . " You 're judgin ' him by me , and I 'm doin ' the work of four men . Now , stand clear of this ladder before you get your head split open . " There was laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nose furiously on the ground . By twelve o'clock the job was finished and the carpenters went home . He had n't said it was a full day 's work he was offering , but he had n't said otherwise either . Nevertheless , I was glad it was over . Em and I stood waiting at the pumphouse for our pay while Hutchinson busied himself in the house . It finally occurred to us , from the sounds coming from the kitchen , that he was having his dinner . He kept us waiting for over an hour . At last he came shuffling across the yard , his face sour with the prospect of paying out money . " Let 's see now , " he said , thumbing through his time book . " Six twenty-five , " Em said . Hutchinson 's head jerked up . " What ? " " Five hours , at seventy-five for me , fifty for the boy . " " You started at eight o'clock ! I looked at my watch the minute we drove in the yard . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . It was a little before seven . " " I 'll be damned ! " shouted Hutchinson . " You ai n't comin ' on my place and skinnin ' me , you goddamned  --  gypsy or whatever you are ! Here 's five dollars , and that 's twice what you 're worth , the both of you ! " Em was trembling , his breath growing erratic .  | I stepped in front of him and took the money . " Em , " I spoke quickly , keeping my voice down , " I know you want to hit him , but if you hit him right now you 'll kill him , and they 'll put you away and I do n't need you put away . I need you with me right now . And besides , it would n't be worth gettin ' put away for killing the likes of him . A lyin ' , cheatin ' , robbin ' son of a bitch like him . But he needs hittin ' , somebody ought to hit him , but not somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be me ! " And with that I turned and smacked the startled farmer as hard as I could across the mouth . He staggered back a few steps and touched his bleeding lip in amazement . Em was even more amazed , so much so he forgot his anger . " Well , I 'll be damned , " he said . Hutchinson , a little pale under his whiskers , lost no time retreating to the house . " I 'll be damned , " Em said . He said it over and over as we walked back to town , looking at me from time to time , his dark eyes shining with pride . " He done what ? " laughed Jayell that night at Dirsey 's , and as Em told it again he broke up , pounding his casted leg on the floor . " Said , Do n't you hit him , Em , you 'll get us in trouble . ' Thenwhap ! right in the chops . Surprised me more'n it did old man Hutchinson ! " Em doubled over with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more beers . " He 's Esther 's blood all right , " said Dirsey . " By the way , what you hear from her lately ? " " We got a letter here from her yesterday , " I said . I fished it out of my pocket . " And there 's something in it about you , Dirsey . " " Yeah , " said Em , " read him that part . " " It 's at the bottom , but I 'll come to it , " I said . " Got to do things in order , of course , " Em said . " He 's her blood , " he said , nodding . " Ssh , Em , " said Jayell . I read : " Dear Everybody , Farette and Earl , Rec. your letter Mrs. Bell , and so glad to hear . Hope this finds you all well . I am about to get over the summer cold I had  --  from the change of climate I guess  --  and am ready to go again . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | being this hot in North Carolina , but Vance laughed at me and said N.C. and Georgia was n't that far apart in their weather . I guess I just forgot . It 's been so long . Well I 'm really glad to hear Earl is getting along well . I could still skin him for running off like that , but if he wants to stay on a while I guess it 's all right . I know you all will look after him . Any expense he causes you now , you send me the bill and I 'll see Vance pays it . We 'll sec if he laughs about that . Ha ! ha ! Must close now as Lucille is not feeling well and I have to fix dinner for the twins . Oh , and I was really tickled about that good for nothing Jojohn planting him a garden . I never thought I 'd see the day he 'd raise anything besides h ? . Anyhow , anything that may keep him from spending so much time at that sorry Dirsey 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well and write soon .

Come through that door hotter'n a two-dollar pistol and , brothers , I mean she lit'ally cleaned house ! Grabbed that deer up there " ? Dirsey turned and pointed over the bar to the buck 's head , which had one antler broken off ? " I had it hanging over by the door then , and she commenced to swing it this-away  --  like a sickle , do n't you know  --  and did n't she have those gentlemen climbin ' the walls ! In two minutes flat there was n't a bottle left standing nor a customer on the place but Wylie , and she left here behind him  --  goosin ' him with that damned horn !

" " The hell you say  --  upped the rent ! Who bought it ? " " Who the hell knows , " said Jayell . " One or another of them blue-blood bastards that owns every other square inch of this town ! You know how they do , buy up little bits and pieces of property  | here and there on the quiet until they get a big enough chunk to put up a big business or development and turn a whopping profit . Did you know they bought the Blue Light quarry property off an old colored woman for fifty dollars an acre ? " Dirsey whistled softly . " And how many million has it turned over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jayell . " Pretty soon there 'll be twelve of ' em ownin ' the world and chargin ' the rest of us rent . Hell , I expect Luther Pierce to sell that shop property out from under me any day . " " Speakin ' of which , Jaybird , " said Em , " when you gon na get that place cranked up again ? Me and the boy here could use some work . " Jayell twisted his beer on the counter . " I do n't know , Em . Do n't look like I ever will . Right now I could n't get financin ' to build a doghouse . Got to do something , though , and soon . " " Listen at him poor-mouth , " said Dirsey , " Mr. Marble Park . ' Palk about your blue-bloods . . . " Jayell slammed down his beer . " Goddamnit , do n't talk to me about that place ! I wish I had never heard that name ! Them and their dinner parties and their damned bridge games .

Jesus , if I had this past year to do over again . . . " Jayell gritted his teeth . " You know , I 'll wonder until the day I die if that damned Fay did n't push that ladder out from under me . I would n't put it past that Bobo one minute . " Dirsey shook his head . " One of these days somebody 's gon na kill that son of a bitch . " " Wo n't be a day too soon , " muttered Em . Dirsey looked at him . " I 'm surprised you and him ai n't crossed paths somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves me alone . I leave him alone . " " Well , " said Dirsey , " Mr. Bobo 's time might not be long off , the way things are goin ' . Lot of folks stirred up about that Supreme Court thing .

Just gives ' em a new bogeyman . " " Fathers ? " said Dirsey . " Who 're you talking about , Jayell ? " " The Southern Fathers ! " said Jayell , getting into his preaching voice again . " That same land-owning , mill-owning little intermarried club of blue-bloods I was talking about before . Those almighty bastards and their watchdog politicians who 've always run the South like it was their own private plantation , that 's who I 'm talking about !

" But Jayell was just warming to his subject . He propped his elbow on the bar and wavered a finger at Dirsey . " Did n't you go hear Senator Broward 's speech at the auditorium last night ? Never ! ' he said . No , sir , not a thing to worry about , go back to work , go back to sleep ; it 's just another bogeyman , and we 'll protect you . The structure is intact . ' " Jayell 's shoulders tightened in a futile gesture . " Do n't you see , the Fathers have always ruled the South like it was a dull child , a child taught to work for nothing and want little . And to be controlled , a child 's got to know the bogeyman ! And they give us the bogeymen , do n't they ? Over the years , they 've played the campaign trails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them  --  a little frayed from use  --  that still remain as favorites . They never fail to fetch the crowd : the Federal Government , that old enemy on the Potomac whose sworn purpose is to bleed to death and gobble up the South , and that Dark Lurking Menace in the Ape Yards . " Jayell drained his bottle and set it down . Conversation had stopped at Dirsey 's ; other customers had turned and were listening . " And now they 've got the bogeyman for the fifties , have n't they , and he 's special , made-to-order , a perfect combination of the other two ! " Jayell leaned forward , his face darkened to a sinister scowl . " A nine-headed monster in the black judicial robes of the highest Court ! " But , " he said , leaning back , eyes bulging , " like the Senator said , there 's not a thing to worry about . They have n't even set a date for compliance  --  why there 's years and years of political maneuvering  | ahead ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress , Southern politicians are recognized masters ! " " Progress ? " said a man down the bar . " You call mixing the schools progress ? " " Hey , come on , Jayell , " said Dirsey under his breath , eyeing the others , " hold it down a little bit , will you . " But Jayell , heartened by the challenge to his opinion , turned and regarded the man solemnly . He slowly slid down off the stool . " Jayell . . . " Dirsey moved after him down the bar , shrugging to the other man about Jayell 's condition . " Em ! " he called , jerking his head rapidly . Jayell limped up to the man , who readied himself . But Jayell only stood looking at him . He turned to the others and raised his arms in benediction . " No worry , my children , " he said soothingly . " Go back to sleep . This is the New South , not the old . The Fathers want no disruption in the industrial generation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to sleep , and be glad this is the twentieth century and not the nineteenth , when the Fathers ' needs were different , and they cried alarm ! And you , my gentle brothers , were called upon to lead us into the nation 's bloodiest war . " At Dirsey 's frantic urging , Em finally sighed and shuffled down the bar and lifted Jayell under his arm . " Pore little fool . Ai n't never had no sense . Never will have none . " I held the door open for them . Dirsey , greatly relieved , was wiping the bar . " Next time you write your Aunt Esther , you tell her hello for me , son , you 'll do that for me , wo n't you ? " he called . " Tell her old Dirsey sends his love . " I waved and let the door go .  | As THE DAYS WENT BY AT COOPER CORNER WE LEARNED NOT TO be so quick to step forward , and when men of Hutchinson 's reputation came we watched the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already promised , and let their trucks go by . It was good to be out early again and working . We bolted a quick breakfast at the bus station , the only place open at that time of the morning , and raced each other to the corner , shouting to hear our voices bounce off the darkened buildings . But it was a summer of mercilessly hard work . I crawled for miles through fields dragging baskets and sacks ; I unloaded truckloads of feed and fertilizer , stacked thousands of bricks . I stood all day in sweltering woods cutting pulpwood and slapping mosquitoes , rocking a cross-cut saw in the endless monotony that blurs the hours and makes the mind go wandering for beautiful things . And later , watched red cracks open in my hands from wrenching corn from withered stalks and shoveling it about in cribs of black dust that left my lungs aching for days after .  | Em kept after me , goading , pushing , yelling when he caught me hopefully watching a dark cloud on the horizon that might rain us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ever ' child ought to be made to do work he hates to do , so he 'll want to get out and find sump'n better ! " The pleasures were simple : the taste of water at three o'clock in the afternoon , the soothing massage of a vibrating truck bed on aching thighs , calluses that came to toughen split and bleeding flesh . I felt myself perceptibly aging that summer , work will age you as surely as time . I got up slower and sighed like the men when I sat down . But there was a hardening too , and that felt good . My hands were like bark when I washed . There were no new muscles that I could see , but I was lean and tough and did n't tire as easily , and , best of all , my left arm was becoming almost as strong as my right . To Em , life was singing again . He had work he could throw himself into , he had money for Dirsey 's and Deva 's , and above all , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I was awake , and as soon in the evening as he could get home , hoeing , fertilizing , suckering , stringing bean runners , hauling water from the well and talking to the vegetables . And let a bug be caught sunning itself on one of Em 's leaves , or a worm be found with its head in one of his tomatoes , and the next instant the poor creature was headed toward oblivion under the dancing boots of the incoherently screaming Indian . " Boy , look at this ! Just look at this ! " Em worried and fretted along the line of overripe tomatoes on the sills ; he picked up cucumbers , squash , bell peppers , clucking like a mother hen over her eggs , running his fingers over withering skins . Peas lay wilting in the sink . The garden , such a nuisance in the planting , now presented us with another problem . Overabundance . I was sick of vegetables . I never wanted to see another vegetable , and still that garden produced . " Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What ! Precious as vegetables are ? Do you know what prices they 're bringin ' these days ? "  | " Well , I 'll tell you this , I 'm not eatin ' another vegetable for breakfast ! " " What we need is an icebox ! " Em pushed back his hat , thinking . " You know what ? Tio said they throwed out that old drink box when they was redoin ' the store . " " I know . I wish they had n't done that . " " I 'll bet you it 's still around somewhere , and that 'd make a perfect icebox ! Let 's go take a look ! " We walked down the woods to the newly renovated store . It hardly looked like the same place . Tio had repainted it , inside and out , with bright red trim and put new green vegetable bins out front . There was a new sign over the door , and the gas pumps , painted blue and silver , stood in the yard like a pair of admirals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apron with his name hand-inked on the pocket . We politely stopped to check for improvements that needed praising . I wanted that icebox as bad as Em at that point , and Tio in a sulk would get us nowhere . " I do n't believe I 've seen that before , " I said eagerly , pointing to the flashing red light in the peanut-parching machine . " Kind of catches your eye , do n't it ? " acknowledged Tio . " Bright as a blessed rainbow , " said Em , looking over the store . " It just do n't look like the same place . " " We 're gon na show ' em , " said Tio . " We 're gon na show ' em good . " " Do n't knows I 'd a picked that color , though , " said Em , looking at the nervous orange of the kerosene pump . " Most kerosene pumps I 've seen were green . " " That makes ours different then , do n't it ? " said Tio . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eye at Em . " What more natural way to advertise kerosene than to paint it the color of fire ? " Jojohn , having realized his error , smiled with relief . " Ah , boy , you got a head on your shoulders . " " Come look inside ! " Tio said . The entire store had been scrubbed and rearranged . The shelves sported a new coat of white , and the floor boards were so clean they looked boiled . The counters were freshly topped with bright linoleum , and squares of it marched away up the stairs . Mr. Teague , in a new bow tie , fidgeted and turned in the checkout cubicle like a cat trying to get comfortable in a corner . " Tio will have to find what you need , " he called out , " I do n't know where nothing is anymore ! "  | " That 's what the signs is for , " said Tio . He lowered his voice . " Hardest part of all was to get him to go self-service . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks . Here , wait up , Em , get you a shopping cart . " He snatched a flimsy contraption away from the wall . " We do n't need a shopping . . . " Em stopped and stared at it . " That looks like a baby carriage . " Tio grinned . " That 's what it was before I made it over . It 's a pistol , ai n't it ? " " Look , " said Em , " what we came about is , I figured we could make an icebox out of that old drink box y'all throwed out . Is it still around ? " " Yeah , it 's out back there . " He led us out into the weeds behind the store and pulled aside a piece of rotted plywood . " I hated to see it go ; it was one of our main attractions . The new box do n't freeze drinks yet , but I 'm working on it . " We dragged the box back to the front of the store and lifted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sheathing was rusted loose , but the insulated box inside seemed solid enough . Tio had salvaged the frame and motor for possible use elsewhere . " Made to order , " said Em , and sent Tio back for his tools . Mr. Teague came out complaining of the slowest business day he 'd seen in months , and sat on the bench under the awning to watch . " Gon na make an icebox outa that , are you ? Tio 's about ruined the new box trying to make it freeze drinks like that one did . Fool froze up and busted a whole case of drinks last week . " Mr. Teague looked from Em to me . " Whole damn case of drinks . . . " Em chiseled and hacksawed the box in half along its belly , even with the bottom of the insulated box inside . What was left was half a drink box with a lid , and an outer skirt of sheathing . " There we are , boy . We take and bury it in a corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a block of ice now and then , and we got the best icebox anywhere around . It 's even got its own hole for drainage . " " Em , " said Tio , " you 're a wonder . " " Come on , let 's get this thing up the hill , " I said , " before that vegetable garden cats the garage . " " Customer ! " cried Tio . He dropped his end and bounded toward a pickup pulling up to the tanks . " Yessir , Mr. Mangum , fill ' er up ? " I was surprised to see Paulie Mangum stopping there . Mr. Teague  | had long since cut off his credit . Paulie lived in the next house down the road from the store and was the only person I ever heard Miss Esther call white trash . No one knew what he did for a living . For recreation he beat his wife . Paulie answered Tio by first telling him to get his goddamned foot off his running board , then he handed him a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scratched off out of the yard . Tio came back reading the leaflet . " What is it , Tio ? " called Mr. Teague . " Just a revival , " said Tio without looking up . The old man shook his head . " Paulie Mangum handin ' out revival notices . I 've lived too long . " Tio returned to where we were standing and handed the paper to me . It said : KNIGHTS OF THE KU KLUX KLAN Will present a program August 22nd 8:30 P.M. Four miles south on Hwy. 93 at Otis Barton 's auction barn . All concerned white citizens are invited to COME HEAR THE TRUTH Featuring the Rev. Haskell Spann of Clingham , Georgia Free transportation will be provided . I had heard about the Klan , of course , but their activities had always been confined to a time before I was born . I was surprised they still existed , especially here in Quarrytown . " Come on , " said Em , " let 's get this icebox home . " " The nineteenth  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tonight ! Hey , you want to go ? " " To a Klan meetin ' ? " " Why not ? They sent us an invitation , did n't they ? " " Heck yeah , why not ? Hey , Em , you wanta come ? " Em , out of  | patience , was hoisting the drink box on his back . " Fine lotta help you are , " he grumbled . " Do you want to go with us tonight ? " I repeated . " Hell no , " he said , " I 'm goin ' to church ! " " Church ! " Mr. Teague was off the bench like a shot . He stood on the sidewalk , mouth agape , blinking , and I realized that Em had just exposed Tio 's latest business-improving scheme . " Merciful God , that 's what 's wrong ! Tio , we 're open on Sunday ! "  | THE NIGHT WAS AGLOW BEHIND BARTON 'S AUCTION BARN . THE SONG was " The Old Rugged Cross . " And so strange to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comforting old hymn trembling with fear , as though a monster might be calling in your mother 's voice . There were about a hundred people in the pasture , leaning against their vehicles , standing , squatting , singing , while a huge cross lapped its fire in the wind . On a flatbed truck a half-dozen men sat in metal folding chairs . They all wore white sheets and pointed hats , some trimmed in red , some in blue . A couple had brought their families , also in costume , the children , replicas of their fathers , playing around the truck in their own little sheets and caps . When the singing was finished the people waited silently , watching the great cross billow and roar and consume itself in black-orange flames . I knew most of the people there , a number of whom had been forced out of the Ape Yard by the influx of blacks . Paulie Mangum was there , of course , and Pete Stokes , the deputy sheriff , and Vince Dupree , who ran the upholstery shop . Rudy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to each other , of course , ' 1 he brothers ran competitive gas stations and had n't spoken to each other since World War Two . Something to do with a prostitute in Germany . The only one of the Klansmen on the truck that I recognized right off was Runty Alf Newton , a house painter who had n't painted anything in recent memory but the front window of the finance company that had repossessed his car . One Saturday night in the picture show Alf awoke suddenly from a drunken nap and began firing a pistol at the villain on the screen . He had n't been off the road more than a month . One of the Klansmen stood up and stepped to the edge of the truck . Then I recognized Otis Barton . He flipped a hand out of a floppy sleeve and adjusted his glasses , and for me the spell was broken . I had to suppress a laugh . On Otis the pointed hat looked like a dunce cap . " Friends , " he said gravely , " you all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news . We 've never had trouble with the niggers in Pollard County . We 've treated ' em right and they 've stayed where they belong . But they 've been active . They 've been pushing . Eisenhower 's screwed up the army to where a man ca n't serve his country without living with ' em , and now the Su-preme Court wants to put ' em in the schools with our kids ! " Otis waited for the murmur to subside . " Now , many of you heard Senator Broward when he was in town a couple weeks ago ; said was n't anything to worry about , but some of us feel it 's time to get organized and be ready to meet this thing head on . The Klan 's not been too active in recent years , but it 's gettin ' active now , and I feel it 's time to organize a klavern here in Quarrytown . These gentlemen on the platform here are members of the Clingham , Georgia , Klan . I want you to listen to what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and meet us man to man , and tell us where you stand on this thing . " Otis patted his chest , fumbling for an opening , and finding none , turned away and , somewhat self-consciously , pulled up his gown . He extracted a piece of paper and read the introduction : " The featured speaker tonight is an ordained man of God , and a respected member of his community . He is pastor of the Logan branch Church of God of Clingham , Georgia , a Mason , Oddfellow , Woodman of the World , and Kludd of the Clingham Klan . I want you to make welcome , the Reverend Haskell Spann ! " Otis stepped back clapping loudly and the crowd half-heartedly  | took up the applause , clapping stiff-armed below the belt as country people do . The Reverend Spann was a tall , heavy man with craggy cheeks and broad , thick hands . He might have been a carpenter or a bricklayer , and probably was . I knew the man well from my experiences in backwoods churches . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love-ah , God-ah , repent-ah , " but when he started preaching , it was a different kind of sermon . This man was preaching hate . Pure hate . It was the blood of every thought , every word . And as they listened , the men on the ground slowly , one by one , as though touched by some faint electric pulse , moved off the fenders and raised out of their squats and stood at attention , scarcely breathing . The man was not easy with his tongue ; the words faltered and sentences broke off in the bell-tolling chant of his ranting . But the hate was there , eloquently there , and the people on the ground responded . Something ominous pervaded that gathering ; it was as strong in the air as the black pine smoke that settled from the whipping flames . Hatred that night became a tangible thing . " The nigger has got to be dealt with ! " he roared , leaning a trembling finger into the light , " before he mongrelizes our race , and his ordained curse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amen , brother . . . ! " Tio and I nearly jumped out of our skins . Doc Bobo and Clyde Fay stepped out of the shadows not five yards to the right of us . Without hesitation they made their way toward the truck . Stunned , the townspeople let them through . The Reverend Spann , a gesture frozen in air , at last found his voice . " By the Lord Jesus . . . coons ! " Doc Bobo continued along , nodding and bowing his way through . The minister whirled around . " Albert ! Raeford ! Are you gon ' just set there ? " Instantly , Alf Newton jumped off the truck and came running . The other two Klansmen clambered down after him , one of them clutching a tire iron . Scooping up a rock , Alf darted through the crowd toward Bobo ; he was drawing up sideways , already into his swing , when Clyde Fay stepped forward and shot a fist to his jaw that dropped him in his sheet like a sack of flour . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the third was drawing back with the tire iron when his head suddenly snapped from under his hat with the force of the big Negro 's fist . All Newton rolled to  | his feet and charged . Fay reached down and lifted him off the ground and stood looking at him , their eyes level . Alf Newton screamed in fury , " Lemme go , nigger , I 'll kill you ! " lie squirmed and yelled over his shoulder , " Y'all come on here ! " " Hold on there ! " shouted Otis Barton . He turned to Reverend Spann . " That 's Bobo , the one I told you about . Y'all hold up . . . listen , I think it 's all right , we ought to let him . . . let ' em through there , let ' em come on through . " Doc Bobo touched Fay 's arm and Fay lowered the little red-faced Klansman to the ground . Bobo stepped forward , smiling politely , and climbed the steps to the truck . The Reverend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not accustomed to having black people appear at Klan meetings , let alone come up to speak , but he did n't know what to do about it either . He looked to the local folks , but they were doing nothing . In fact , some of them looked eager to hear what the black man was going to say . The minister had no choice but to step aside , although his look told the crowd he considered it highly irregular . Doc Bobo waited , in that curious attitude of authority and humility he carried off so well , until the men on the platform reclaimed their chairs . But when he turned and faced the crowd , there was iron in his voice . " As your humble servant these thirty-odd years , I come to ask the reason for this gathering tonight , to learn what has been done to merit your distrust . Has any black man used the wrong restroom in Pollard County , sat on the wrong stool at a cafe , touched the wrong water fountain , conducted himself in any manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me his name , " he said , pointing . " Give me his name . . . and he 'll not see the sunrise tomorrow ! " Doc Bobo paused to run his gaze along every face in the crowd . " My friends , we are well aware of your concern in light of recent events , but you must know that your concern is but one-tenth of ours . We , who ask nothing but to offer you our good and faithful service as we have served your fathers and grandfathers , we pray , gentlemen , that you will not , at this most crucial time in our relations , allow a wedge of suspicion to be driven between us . " Is this a time for disruption ? New industries are coming to this region , new textile and chemical concerns are locating around us , as the honorable Senator Broward has pointed out , to bolster our own magnificent granite industry . There is talk of a hydroelectric dam to he built at Oconostee , with limitless economic possibilities  | for both our peoples , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our local economy that will be felt in every business . Will we show a face of dissension ? A community in racial turmoil ? Or will we agree that peace is the common goal of both our races ? " And here Doc Bobo emphasized his point : " Peace as we have known it in this town ? " He paused to let it sink in . " You know me , " he said softly , " you know what I stand for . Do you really feel a need for vigilantes ? Is that the message we want sent from our town ? " Let us hold our fears to the light . The Supreme Court , by some vague reasoning known only to itself , has decreed that separate schools is unconstitutional . They have set no date , so , as the good Senator said , having made this gesture to the new liberal element that now controls our government , like as not they will forget the matter and turn their attention to other , more meaningful business . At any rate , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing as states ' rights , and we are fortunate enough to have people in Congress well equipped to look after our interests . Therefore , gentlemen , I trust you will forget this matter and turn your attention to other and more important affairs , such as the big centennial we have to celebrate this coming year , the first hundred years of our granite industry . You gentlemen of the Klan , " he said , turning , " you come down to the Ape Yard , then , and we 'll give you some barbecue that 'll melt in your mouth ! " There was a loosening among the crowd . Even the Klansmen were chuckling their relief . " As for you , my friends and neighbors " ? Doc Bobo struck a wide-eyed , comic pose ? " you keep yo ' eye on de Su-preme Co't . Ah 'll take keer o ' de Ape Yah 'd ! " Caught by the sudden switch , a favorite trick of Bobo 's at the civic clubs , the crowd roared its approval , bursting into enthusiastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made his way through the crowd , nodding to acquaintances , shaking hands , as he and Fay made their way across the pasture to the woods . I felt it was time for us to be getting away from there , but when I moved Tio gripped my arm . He pointed with his chin . Then I saw them , black men , about a dozen of them , guns drawn , melting back into the trees . We gave them plenty of time to clear the woods before we started crawling out .  | WITH THE COMING OF FALL , WORK GOT SCARCER AT THE CORNER . There was never enough to go around , and by unspoken agreement Em and I sat still with the other younger men until those with children had found work , and then the elderly . Often as not that was all there was , and we returned home with nothing but hope for the next clay . Finally school started and I was limited to whatever I could find in the afternoons . Most often I found nothing but Em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we gave up the Corner for good and left the others , the regulars , the eternal hopefuls , waiting under the fall clouds as cold and gray as road-bank snow , talking of trivial things in their jumbled jargon . The sleepy , waiting families . Old Aaron Tim with twine in his shoes idling under the umbrella oak . Small boys shouting for echoes . I stood on the curb a long time . If I was to continue going to school , something had to be done . I was wearing my last pair of pants . The only other good pair I had , the corduroys , had caught on a hacksaw blade stuck under the siding of the garage and been ripped open to the knee .  | I stood , looking up and down the street , trying to get up my courage . The Good Samaritan Center was a combined effort of the local churches that collected clothing and other discards to be sold cheaply or given away to the needy . Pinnacle Baptist was one of its chief supporters . Miss Esther had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had delivered to the Center for Miss Esther , it did n't seem like charity to ask for one pair of school-grade pants . It still did n't seem so to me , and I had given it a lot of thought since my and Em 's argument about it the night before . In a roundabout way I had mentioned the possibility of the Center , and Em frowned and shook his head . It was a hypocritical position , I thought , but he was adamant . I was not to go begging . But apparently it was all right to go to school in rags . Em could n't be expected to understand , so I had to make up my own mind . And I had . As soon as he lay down for his nap I had slipped away . And now that I 'd come this far , I told myself , I had to go through with it . After a last check of the streets for someone who might recognize me , I shoved open the door and marched in . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the eyes of the charity ladies . Middle-aged , wealthy , dressed in the best from Atlanta 's fashion houses , they were two bright Easter eggs among the pile of rags . One was sitting in a lawn chair knitting , talking to another standing at the counter . The one at the counter glanced up , then finished what she was saying before turning to me , smoothing her hips . " Yes ? " " I 'd like a pair of pants , please . " " Oh ? " She lifted an eyebrow at the knitter and spread her virgin white hands on the counter . " And who might you be ? " " Earl Whitaker . I 'll take anything at all , " I said , then added , " My aunt used to give a lot . " " Could n't your parents come in with you ? " " No , ma'am . " The knitter stood up to have a better look at me . She squinted through her tinted glasses . They exchanged looks . " Are you from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe he 's from out in the country , " said the knitter . " Are you from out in the country ? " " No , ma'am  --  I just need one pair  --  for school . I could pay you something . . . " " Well , no , it 's for charity . That 's what the Center is for  --  for charity , but we do n't usually give out to children . Now , if your mother 's ashamed to come in . . . " I was n't going to make it . Fear you can fight against , shout down with anger . But not shame . There is no defense against shame . " Never mind , " I said , " I do n't need them . " I turned around and came face to face with Em Jojohn , staring through the glass . The door banged open and there he stood , in as grand a rage as I had ever seen . " What the hell are you doin ' here ! " he roared . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't give a damn what you told me ! " I shouted back at him . I wanted to get away and hide . I started by him and he grabbed my arm and flung me back . " You do n't beg ! " " You do n't tell me what to do ! Get out of my way ! " The charity ladies moved farther down the counter . One of them glanced at the telephone . " Who are you to talk anyway ? The first time I ever saw you , you was begging ! " " I beg ! " he shouted furiously . " I do anything I want to ! You do n't beg ! " And with that he grabbed me by the nape of the neck and literally threw me out into the street . I scrambled to my feet and charged him , dimly aware of people stopping to look , of the ladies cowering at the door . He grabbed my shirt and snatched me into the alley . " I 'll kill you , Jojohn ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I twisted and managed to land a solid kick into him . He howled in pain and slammed me up against the brick wall . " I ai n't never put a hand to you yet , boy . . . ! " I caught him hard on the chin . He shook it off and I caught him from the other side . He growled and stepped back , and I went headfirst into a pile of crates . Ile dragged me out by the heels and shook me violently until I thought my neck would snap , then he shoved his face close to mine .  | " Look at you ! See what it done to you ! I can beg ' cause sons a bitches owes me ! It do n't shame me . But look at you ! Do n't you never do nothin ' that shames you ! " And he flung me over his shoulder and carried me , fighting and kicking and yelling with every ounce of strength I had , out through the block of stores , along the warehouses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He strode down the middle of the road , cars slowing and moving around us , people leaning out to stare . I continued to fight him , shouting myself hoarse with every cuss word I knew , until finally , striding across the iron bridge of Twig Creek , he growled with exasperation and heaved me over the rail . I surfaced gasping in the freezing cold water to fling a final set of epithets after him as he continued up the road , muttering and slinging his arms . We went back to scouting up odd jobs around town , which was n't much but a little yard work here and there , and helping a couple of the warehouses with their fall inventories . Tio offered to reopen my account at the store but I turned him down . It was too much of a strain getting the other one paid off . Besides , I told him , trying not to gag on the words , we had a few shelves of Em 's vegetables that the boarders had canned for him . The boarders were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there was a growing concern among all of us during that time , and from a source none of us would have expected . It was the tone of the letters coming from North Carolina , a tone that was anything but like Miss Esther . The boarders wrote to her faithfully once a week , and under their prodding I managed to get off a note to her now and then  --  mostly the " I 'm fine , how are you ? " variety  --  but the sporadic responses we got back were becoming less inquiring about what was going on around the house , the neighborhood ; they dropped their advice about cleaning and canning , their raucous anecdotes , and were centering more and more on the small , confined world in which Miss Esther now found herself , becoming ever more morose with each writing . The boarders were down at the store one Friday afternoon when I came in , and Mrs. Bell was just finishing reading the latest one to Mr. Teague :  | " . . . took us all out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to be out for a change , but I could n't enjoy it . He fussed the whole time . He sent his dinner back three times . I told him he better not send it back anymore or they might spit in it or something . Lucille got upset about that and we had to leave . " They have n't talked to me all day . I do n't care . " It sure is pretty out the window . I always did like the fall . It always made me want to be up and about doing things . But I just do n't have the energy I used to . The doctor says I 'm sleeping too much . " I guess I 'm just catching up on all I lost with you all . ha . " Must close now , it 's getting harder to see to write . It comes on me sometimes . It must be this new medicine , I think I may be allergic to it . Love to all , Esther . " Mrs. Bell tucked the letter back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It just do n't sound like Esther , " said Mrs. Porter . " She 's not happy up there . " " Well , of course she ai n't happy , " said Mr. Rampey . " Would you he , locked in with that tribe ? " " Esther 's very strong , " said Mrs. Bell . " I 'm sure her son is caring for her the best he can . " " Oh , for God 's sake , " snapped Mr. Jurgen , jerking open the drink cooler , " that son of hers could n't properly care for a hog ! Would you like a drink , Lester ? " " Not out of there , " said Mr. Rampey . " I 'd like a Dr. Pepper , please , " said Mrs. Metcalf . " You know , " she said , " maybe she is allergic to her medicine . . . " Mr. Burroughs pulled out a Pepsi and held it aloft . " What happened to that box that used to freeze ' em ? " he wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , " said Mrs. Cline . " We could have taken care of her . " " Come in , Theron , come in , " called Mr. Teague over the register . Theron Walsh , the young black man who read meters for the power company in the Ape Yard , came in the store . " What can I do for you ? "  | " Mr. Teague , I come to see can I use your telephone . They want me to call the po-lice down there . " " Police ? Where , down where ? Who wants you to call ? " " The welfare lady , down at Miz Lampham 's , lady lives down in the bottom . She 's been sick lately and now she 's in there and the do ' locked and the welfare lady say we better get the po-lice . She said would I come up and call . " Mr. Teague came out from behind the counter . " I 'll go see about her . Tio ! " " I 'll come too , you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , " said Mr. Rampey . " Woody , hey Woody ! " Mr. Woodall dropped his Nehi on the floor . " Come on , " said Mr. Rampey , motioning . Mr. Jurgen was already holding the door . " You ladies take care of the store , " said Mr. Teague . " But , " protested Mrs. Metcalf , " we do n't know . . . " " Prices are stamped on most everything , " said Mr. Teague . " If it ai n't , charge whatever seems fair . Go right in , go right in , " he said to two black women coming in , " you 'll be more'n taken care of . " The Lampham woman had been in the hollow less than a year . She lived alone in a shack in Fletcher Bottom . When we arrived there was already a small crowd milling about the yard . A couple of young boys clung to the window sill , trying to peer in . The young white woman from the welfare department was on the porch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " Where are the police ? " " Never mind the police , " said Mr. Teague , making his way stiffly up the steps . " How long since anybody 's checked on her ? " " The neighbors say she has n't been seen for two or three days . One of my clients called the office . " " I thought she was on the welfare . Ai n't you been keepin ' a check on her ? " " Well , no , " the woman corrected him , " she 's not on welfare . . . " " But she signed up better ' n four months ago , " said Mr. Teague . " She told me so herself . " " She did fill out an application , but it was incomplete so it was never processed . " " What ! " " The medical history was incomplete . It was sent over to the  | Senior Citizens Visiting Committee to have someone call on her to check it out , but . . . " " God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 're overworked as it is . . . " Mr. Teague was already trying the door . " Wait , now , do n't you think we ought to call . . . " " Stand aside there , Alvah ! " Mr. Burroughs strode briskly across the porch and his size-thirteen brogan landed beside the flimsy doorknob . The door banged opened and Mr. Teague marched into the house . The skeletal old black woman raised herself feebly and groped on the night table for her glasses . Mr. Teague went straight to her bedside and bent down to look in her face . " It 's Alvah Teague , what 's wrong with you , Ruby ? " She wet her lips and tried to speak . " How long since you seen the doctor ? " " Who  --  who is it ? " She was frightened and confused . Mr. Teague walked to the door . " Anybody know her people ? " A woman stepped forward . " She got a boy down in Columbus , Mist ' Teague . He were due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his hips , blinking , thinking . He looked up at Mr. Burroughs . The other man looked down at the woman and slowly wiped his mouth . " Ramp ! " He reached down and snatched back the sheets , exposing legs as small as a child 's . Mr. Rampey knelt on the other side of the bed and they lifted her carefully and made their way out through the crowd . Mr. Rampey looked up at the welfare lady . " How come you people can take such good care of them that do n't need it . " With the help of Jurgen and Woodall , they eased themselves and the Lampham woman on the truck bed and sat cradling her in their arms . Tio adjusted the bricks under the seat and got back behind the wheel . " Easy now , boy , " said Mr. Teague , " watch them ruts . " Dr. Breisner pronounced it pneumonia , with complications . " And with the malnutrition . . . hell . " He gave her a shot and sent Tio to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her the night , though . " " Should n't she he in the hospital ? " asked Mrs. Porter . Dr. Weisner sighed . " Hell , I would n't even move her again . They 'll just kill her up there . Let her sleep . "  | Out in the hall , Dr. Breisner said , " Well , Horace , looks like you 've got another guest , " and , with a sardonic smile added , " I did n't know you were taking in the black ones now . " Mr. Burroughs looked in at the women slowly gathering their rockers about the bed . Two of them were fixing a tent . Farette came in with a steaming kettle . " Is she black , Huff ? " He shook his head . " Well , you know , when you get our age you do n't see too good . " They walked together down the stairs . " Well , anyhow , " said Dr. Breisner , " this one wo n't be with you too long . " " Aw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of us at one time or another , and we 'll be around to take you in . By the way , how your boys doin ' , Huff ? " " Doin ' fine . The oldest one , Henry , just made captain ; he and Mary are still in Pensacola . Tad finished up his doctorate this fall at the university , and of course Joseph is still in high school . " Surprised , Mr. Burroughs said , " I did n't know Tad was gon na make a doctor too . " " Hell , not a real doctor . A Ph.D. , in history , for Christ 's sake . Fact , he 's been in and out of town all summer doing work on his dissertation . " " On his what ? " " He 's doing his final project for his degree on Pollard County history . " Dr. Breisner shook his head . " Got ta hand it to him , though , he pulled one off there . He got a two-thousand-dollar grant from the Pollard Centennial Commission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , you know , the hundred years since the Poncini brothers , and the promise of a five-hundred-dollar bonus if he locates the Robinson grave . . . he 's spent most of his time this summer on that . " " Hell , they 've dug up half the Johns property lookin ' for that scutter and they ai n't found him yet . " " Yeah , but Tad says he 's on to something they do n't know about . He 's got this theory . Anyway , he says come centennial time in January he 'll be ready to spring old Easter Robinson once and for all . " " Well , " said Mr. Burroughs , " still and all , the town would do better with another real doctor than a dead Civil War bandit . Want a little something , Huff ? " Dr. Breisner shook his head , but Mr. Rampey was already at his  | elbow twisting a cork . The doctor took a long swallow and came up wet-eyed . " Damn , Ramp , that 's awful ! Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I believe the son of a bitch is cutting it with Clorox . " " Pour it out . That damn stuff 'll eat out your stomach . " " Well , if that damn Baptist courthouse gang would n't keep the county voted dry . . . " I 've got a bottle of good stuff in the car . Come with me , boy , and I 'll send it in . Keep an eye on the old woman , Horace . I 'll stop by in the morning  --  if I do n't hear from you before then . " " She 'll be here , " said Mr. Burroughs . He leaned against the porch post . " That crowd upstairs wo n't let her go . "  | FINALLY , WE GOT A BREAK . JAYELL , NO LONGER ABLE TO BEAR watching Gwen leave the house for work , and apparently having drunk his melancholic self-pity to the dregs , came tearing out of convalescence and took the job with Smithbilt Homes . They had no major projects going in Quarrytown at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals , but on those Jayell gave Em , the shop boys and me every hour of work he could . His new income also enabled him to reopen the shop for repairs and cabinet work . Jayell 's first assignment was the bogging Abbeville development , where his first action was to cut the work force by half . He reorganized the teams of heavy-equipment operators , carpenters , masons , electricians and painters and put them on strictly scheduled plans , would not tolerate the slightest holdup or delay , and unleashed his maniacal wrath on any supplier with a late delivery . Within a couple of weeks the project was not only moving again but ahead of schedule , with a precision and attention to quality construction that made even the FHA inspectors shake their heads . Several of Smithbilt 's  | board members flew up from Miami to inspect the job . They had long luncheons with Jayell , and took back some of his designs . Gwen was ecstatic . She and Jayell had been invited to join the country club . She was having her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began giving lavish parties  --  lavish by Jayell 's standards anyway . Jayell 's idea of a big get-together was to bring his television set and a washtub of iced beer down to the shop for himself , Em , Skeeter and Carlos to watch Tech stomp Georgia . Gwen had him start a swimming pool in the backyard like the Henderson 's ( " Now ? In September ? " ) , and for his birthday surprised him with the announcement that with her first paycheck of the school year she had made a down payment on a lot at Lake Lorraine . It seemed Jayell was being ensconced at last in what he had called that " nouveau middle class . " " Great God in heaven ! " he moaned over the din of a Dirsey 's Saturday night . " You know what I did last night ? I played mahjong ! Mah-damn-shong ! Can you believe it ? With Herbie Craft and his wife , for pete 's sake . A lousy vice-president of First National Bank , a high-class loan shark , and she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says  --  says , you know Mr. Craft . ' And I say , Sure I know him . He repossessed my mama 's first refrigerator ! ' H000-you should have seen his face ! " Jayell took a long draught of beer and sleeved his mouth . " And you know where she is tonight ? She 's at the armory practicin ' a play for that Little Theater she helped organize . Yessir , she 's in her black toreadors and a little yellow blouse pulled up and tied up to here , and she 's prancing around that stage and gettin ' kissed by Wendell Hines ! And you know sump'n else ? " Jayell 's eyes narrowed menacingly . " When it opens , I 'll have to go and watch him do it , and applaud the son of a bitch ! " There was silence at the bar . They all sympathized with him . It threw a pall on the place . " Kee-rist , " muttered a truck driver from New Jersey , and ordered fresh beers all around . " Kee-rist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gwen had grown increasingly cool to me , even at school , and avoided Em altogether . The shop boys , being black , posed no social threat to her . But Em and I were different , and I could tell she never knew quite what to do about us.  | Then , a few days after that night at Dirsey 's , she managed that final break between Jayell and the Ape Yard . A minor happenstance gave her the opportunity and she seized on it , and Em and I were ordered away for good . Em and I were helping Jayell pour cement for the swimming pool . The missionary board was meeting at Gwen 's house that day , so we had strict instructions to keep outside , which we did , except for slipping into the kitchen for water , since the plumbers working on the pool had turned off the outside spigot . Soon after the guests arrived I stepped in for a drink , and since it was the day after the Little Theater opening , they were taking time before the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only played a leading role in but also directed . Sissy Davis , the mayor 's sister , was reading the review in the Star : " . . . and certain to be nominated for the Quarrytown Little Theater 's first Oscar is a delightful newcomer to our community , Gwendolyn Burns Crooms . Mrs. Crooms , a member of the Quarrytown High faculty ( where she assumes the duties of drama coach from the capable hands of Thelma Martin , who is on leave of absence this year ) , was a prime mover this summer in the establishment of the Little Theater , and proved last night that she is not only a capable director but a splendid actress as well . She was utterly delightful as the vampish ex-wife , Clara , and literally threw herself into the role . " Frivolous , witty and charming , her face often conveyed more than words , and even the lift of an eyebrow could be devastating . She was completely believable as the cunning Clara , struggling to win back her ex-husband 's affections . Estelle Watson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in getting her lines across to the audience , but Wendell Hines and Carl Lee Wyche were perfect as the boisterous army buddies , Pit Stop and Ed , and kept the audience in gales of laughter . Technical director Lorne Suggs ' inspired stage setting provided a worthy frame for this top drawer production , written by our own Hal T. Whitmire of the Star staff . The play will run two more nights , Friday and Saturday , with an 8:3o P.M. curtain time . Tickets are one dollar  --  fifty cents for students  --  and may be purchased at the door , or at the Star office . "  | " Well ! " Sissy Davis put down the paper and looked around the room . " It seems we have a celebrity in our midst today ! " The ladies put down their Sanka for a burst of applause . " Oh , really , " fluttered Gwen , " the cast , the crew , they were all just so marvelous to work with . And with their help I have to say it was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ladies put down their cups for another round of applause . " We 're off to an excellent start , " she continued , " and with the continued support of the community , and the talents of people like Lorne Suggs , we just ca n't help but have the finest Little Theater in Georgia . " That brought applause for Hilda Suggs , the director 's wife , to be passed on to her husband . " Now , really , " said Gwen , " we should get on with our meeting . I 'm sure Reverend March has other commitments . " The ladies dutifully put away their cake and coffee and the minister led into a discussion of the church 's sponsored missionary , one Reverend Pritchard , who was toiling among some natives in New Guinea . I was about to slip back out to work , but became so engrossed in the trials of the missionary , outlined in a letter which the pastor read aloud , that I could n't tear myself away . It seemed the Reverend Pritchard was working with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any kind of civilization , and were the stubbornest lot , he believed , to whom anyone had ever tried to bring the Lord . And the Reverend was up to his elbows . They had n't any more care for religion than a bunch of hogs , he said , and thought services at chapel nothing more than a grand time for settling intervillage squabbles . A man could n't shut his eyes in prayer for fear of getting brained by his neighbor . He was at his wit 's end . His wife had made some progress in curtailing fornication in the schoolhouse this year , but for his part , he could see little hope for elevating this lot to salvation while they were still killing one another at vespers . He closed with a request for the congregation 's prayers , and a couple more gross of brassieres . It seemed the men of the village , in a childish display of jealousy , would n't let their wives wear them unless they had them too . The Reverend also needed another shipment of Testaments and toilet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , as the savages still had n't learned the difference . " Huh ! " rumbled a voice through the quiet . " Seems to me your Reverend needs to get oft his knees and spray that crowd with bird shot ! " Everyone looked up as Em Jojohn loped in and hung his hulk  | on the mantel . " Forgo your Testaments and send him a good twelvegauge , that 's what 's needed to fetch that bunch . " Gwen looked about frantically . Her eyes fell on me . I shrugged and waggled my water glass , disclaiming any responsibility . " This is Mr. Jojohn , " she said uncomfortably , " he 's helping my husband in the yard . " " Funny thing about religion , Reverend . " Em studied his cigarette and flicked an ash in the vase . " It do n't seem worthwhile to transplant it when it springs up so natural by itself . Take the case of Waldo Payne . " " I  --  I 'm afraid I do n't see your point , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is simple . " Em paced the hearth , warming to his talk , a rambling monologue that I knew would lead nowhere and accomplish nothing but to get him out of the sun for a few minutes . " There was this fellow named Waldo Payne I used to tie steel with . Wild'un , they called him . He was a wild'un too . Come out of Cumberland Gap . A real scrapper , I mean into sump'n all the time ! Seems like it did n't come a Monday the job super was n't down at the jail bailin ' Waldo out of one scrape or another . But a worker ? You never seen the beat . Come hot weather or cold , there was n't a rod buster on the job could come anywhere near him for layin ' in steel . Take a day it 's a hundred in the shade and everybody else is eatin ' salt tablets and suckin ' the water can , old Wild'un 's in the steel pile hollerin ' , Where 's them number elebens ! ' Put him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizontals going up , and you never see Waldo on the lighter end . No sir , he 's in the middle with the curve and the weight , and workin ' the others to keep up with him too . He 'd lay them big bars acrost his knees and climb that tank like a monkey , with the others just a scramblin ' , ' cause you see , once the middle got higher than the ends , the weight was throwed on them ! Then before they got their wall belts hitched good , old Waldo 'd have his saddle ties on and was back down at the steel pile , hollerin ' , Gim me them number elebens . ' " Em shook his head and chuckled and drained somebody 's coffee cup , and continued before Gwen could interrupt . " One day , up in Virginia , we was pouring this dam . Waldo was handling the concrete bucket . They was pouring through a chute in the river and lettin ' the concrete set up under water . Well , nobody knows how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crane operator , and  | Jimmy Leggett could take a drag line and pick your hat off the ground , but somehow Waldo got bumped with the concrete bucket , and down the chute he went . " " Oh . " Sissy Davis put a hand to her mouth . " How awful ! " Em lit a cigarette and took his time . Gwen sat staring at the floor . " Well ? " said another lady . " Did they get him out ? " " Get him out ? From under forty foot of water with three yards of concrete on him ? How were they gon na get him out of that ? " " Then what did they do ? " " Why , the only thing they could do  --  they started pouring concrete again . " " On top of him ? " asked the minister incredulously . Em grimaced and rubbed his neck impatiently . " Well , there was n't no way to pour around him , was there ? ' Sides , if they stopped , and let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weak place . Naw , when the super come running and was told what happened , he just told ' em to get on with it , and went for the sheriff . " " What a terrible tragedy , " said Sissy Davis . " Not altogether , " said Em . " Waldo 's wife was compensated , and folks said she seemed a lot happier with the insurance money than she 'd ever been with Wild'un . As for him , well , he lived like he wanted and got buried in style . What more could any man want ? Think about it , the whole Emalette River dam for a vault ! Ai n't a pharaoh or emperor ever had a tomb that 'd stand up to Waldo Payne 's . " Something was worrying the preacher . He just could n't leave it alone . " I still fail to see the relevance of that to our discussion of religion . " " Coming to that , Reverend . " Em pointed to Gwen 's coffee cup . " You through with that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked it up and drained it . " Well , when the dam was near completion the super had a big stone vase fitted into the side , just below the guard rail , to put flowers in . Some of Wild'un 's pals requested it , in a kind of memorial . And when the job was finished one of the local churches took it up , and put in flowers for Wild'un regular . Then , as time went on , strangers got to dropping in change to help pay for the flowers , thinking it was some kind of shrine or something . Then young folks got to courting up there , and throwing in pennies to make wishes and stuff . Well , before long word got around among  | the hill people that the dam had healing powers , and a faith healer got to holding revivals up there , and before you knew it , it got to be such a hazard with the crowds holding up traffic and the faithful falling in the river that the law stepped in and had the vase knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's booth to keep traffic moving until things quieted down again ; which it did even'chally , though some said the watchman took money from hard believers for a long time after . But , as I said , it did quiet down even'chally and things got back to normal . " The preacher waited , but it became obvious the Indian was through . He pressed his thumbs to his temples . " I 'm afraid , Mr. ? ah , Jojohn , I still do n't see your point . " " You do n't . " Em shrugged his shoulders in exasperation . " Well , that 's all for me , then , " he said , heading for the hall , " for I ca n't make it no plainer . " I shook my head . He had done it again . His purpose accomplished , cool , refreshed , leaving behind confusion . On another occasion , for another crowd , he might have delivered up his story on sweet Sally Flagg who took on Fort Bragg . Later , I kind of wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , the whole thing backfired anyway . When the guests had gone Gwen came out to where we were screeding cement and told Jayell in no uncertain terms she did n't want us back there anymore . " Aw , honey , come on . . . " " I mean it , Jayell ! " she said , tossing her hair in fury . " That is absolutely the last straw ! " Jayell stood meekly , caught in a moment of Jayell weakness and confusion , looking for a way out . " I did n't mean no harm . . . " Em began , and she whirled on him . " Shut up , you  --  you filthy animal ! You are undoubtedly the most  --  grotesque excuse for a human being I have ever met . Why do n't you take that trashy kid and stay in that slimy Ape Yard where you belong ! " Jayell dropped his screed board . " Gwen , for pete 's sake ! " " Jayell , " said Em , " if you do n't slap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . "
