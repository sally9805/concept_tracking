txt It should happen at 2:36 this afternoon , give or take a few minutes . There 's no way you 'll know it . If , you 're strolling down the street , it 's not something you can see , like an eclipse . ' You 're not likely to feel anything , like an earthquake . It will just happen . The country 's gross national product will cross the $2 trillion mark . That is- $2,000,000,000,000 , a lot of money . Does anyone really care ? To be sure , the gross national product is not an inconsequential number . It represents after all the nation 's total output of goods and services . But what difference does it ? make that G.N.P . has hit $2 trillion ? Is n't it like the billionth person to swallow a 's hamburger ? Is n't it like the millionth family to vacation in Miami Beach ? The big . number does n't mean a whole lot , because most of it is merely a result of inflation . It seems difficult to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years to get to the $1 trillion , juncture , the second trillion is upon us after a mere seven years . Something , like . two-thirds of the second trillion was ? ' : inflation , inflation , inflation , " in the words of one economist . He reasons that inflation represented only about a third of the first trillion . Small wonder , then , that economists instead pay attention to . " real " G.N.P. , which is a measure adjusted to discount inflation . . ? The coming $2 trillion moment is. thus something less than the talk of the economic community . It 's worth hearing Kerwin Stallings on this . He is a vice president and economist at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York . He came up with the time of the big ( not so big ? ) event , and announced it in the monthly . Morgan Guaranty Survey . " Oh , I guess it will have about the same significance as a person 's birthday , " Mr. Stallings remarked . " A recognition of a fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trillion mark is not of great consequence in current dollar figures . I guess it just reminds us of how awfully big the , economy is .. " " I do n't recall that anyone paid that much attention to the crossing of the - $1 trillion mark , " said Michael Evans , head of Chase Econometric Associates . " So I do n't think that anyone will particularly notice this . I have no party planned for the occasion . " Another economist said , " I do n't view it is an occurrence of a magnitude where , 10 years from now , people will try to recall exactly where they were at 2:36 , Friday the 27th of Janu.ary . " How is it that Mr. Stallings knew G.N.P . would hit $2 trillion at 2:36 today , give or take a few minutes ? Why not ** Why not tomorrow afternoon ? , Why not Sunday , just before the movie of the week ? . Here 's how : He took as a base the G.N.P . figure for the third quarter for which official data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of about 10 percent in current dollars . Mr. Stallings used that rate to work out precisely when $2 trillion would arrive . It took a few minutes to make the calculation . " It 's not a foolproof method , " he ad , mitted . " I know that G.N.P . growth isnt constant day by day . Some days , in fact , G.N.P . goes down . You just ca n't tell where it is at a given moment . I could be a week or so off , but nobody will ever know . " ? The whole calculation of G.N.P . ? the handiwork of the Department of Commerce ? is an inexact and somewhat arbitrary undertaking to begin with . After all , the thought of taking a huge and hopelessly complex economy and expressing it as a single number ' is a bit unnerving . Give a Few , Take a Few Basically , the Commerce Department has come up with assumptions on what to include ( products and activities with clear market value ; not something like housework one does oneself ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times change , though , the department does occasionally change its mind on some things . Anyway , G.N.P . is always and inevitably an estimate , inasmuch as Cornhardly bothers to count every last . sponge that someone purchased . As it gets new information , in fact , the department goes back and revises past G.N.P . figures , sometimes altering a quarter 's figure by several billion dollars . Thats less than it sounds , when you keep in mind that G.N.P . grows by a cool half billion dallars or so a day . So is the man in the street better off with a $2 trillion G.N.P . than he // Mark Alan Stamaty was with a measly $1 trillion G.N.P. ? Well , the important thing is what 's happening with real G.N.P . Real G.N.P . is figured in terms of the purchasing power of 1972 dollars , to discount inflation . when G.N.P . hits $2 trillion , according to Mr. Stallings ' math , real G.N.P . will approach about $1.37 trillion . Real G.N.P . has also been growing , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual increase in real G.N.P . averaged 2.9 percent . in the last decade , compared with 3.5 percent in the previous 90 years . However , the birth rate has tapered off , and so percapita G.N.P . continues to move along nicely . " From the standpoint of public wellbeing , a higher G.N.P . per capita means more goods are consumed in the public 's behalf , " Mr. Stallings said . " Of course , you could get the argument that if less goods were available , we 'd be better off and happier . But most of the population would agree that being rich is better than being poor . " Meanwhile , G.N.P . milestone watchers should be happy to hear that the three trillion dollar mark will be here before they know it . If the present rate of growth keeps up , Mr. Stallings has calculated the moment at 9:04 A.M. on April 29 , 1982 . The fourth trillion is expected at 2:02 A.M. on May 5 , 1985 , when most people will presumably be sound asleep .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
