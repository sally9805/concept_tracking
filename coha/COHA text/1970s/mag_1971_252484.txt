In the ritual of parties-out-of-power , the Democrats are beginning to rally around the unifying idea that Richard Nixon can be beaten in 1972-a thought encouraged by the party 's gains in the 1970 elections . It is hardly too early for the Democrats to begin . The party is financially strapped , disorganized and lacking any coherent special program to offer as an alternative to the Administration 's . <P> For the moment , however , the Democrats are concentrating on party basics . Last week the Democratic National Committee gathered in Washington to adopt some of the procedural reforms that were much debated in the midst of the almost self-destructive Democratic Convention in Chicago . <P> One of the major complaints then was that the selection of delegates to the convention was undemocratic , favoring small states over large . On this , the committee compromised last week , voting to allot delegate strength 53% on the basis of a state 's electoral votes-a concession to smaller states-and 47% on the size of the state 's Democratic vote for President in the last three elections-a decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as New York , California and Illinois . <P> The committee took other steps to open up the party system at the lowest levels . It barred the unit rule-meaning that individual delegates can vote their own preferences rather than being forced by party machines to vote en bloc . Delegates must be selected in the year of the convention , which will help to eliminate the unresponsiveness of delegates chosen sometimes four years in advance . By amending requirements that tend to exclude less professional participants and ordering antidiscrimination standards , the committee hopes to gather more blacks , women and the young into the party process . The filing fee for delegates can not exceed $10 , for example , and a petition to run needs the names of no more than 1% of the body selecting the delegates . In order to reduce the power of party bosses , the committee also decreed that no more than 10% of the delegates can be chosen by state committees .                    @
