txt A striking contrast exists between the expected mildness of President Carter 's anti-inflation message and the potential dynamite of his forthcoming energy proposals . The contrast reflects both the urgency of the nation 's energy problem and the fact , as Treasury Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal says , that no one " has a magic solution " to licking inflation , Having ruled out wage ? and price controls , the President appears to have little beyond persuasion , plus closer surveillance of inflationary trends , with which to keep industry and labor on the path of price stability . On energy , however , Mr. Carter 's program will bristle with Concrete suggestions : a blood , . sweat , and tears type of message , with penalties in the form of taxes and higher prices to discourage wastage , and cash bonuses for Americans who burn less energy in their homes , offices , and factories . Though neither message ? ahti-inflation nor energy ? is available at this writing , both will be set against the following background : When Mr. Carter became President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pose little threat- . Thus he launched a two-year , $31.2 billion stimulus program , built in the first year around a $50 rebate to almost every American . In the succeeding months , as Congress wrangled over the program , the economy picked up steam and so did inflation . Wholesale prices now are climbing at higher than a 10 percent annual rate . So the President began to put together an anti-inflation package , signaling clearly to business and labor , however , that wage and price controls ? the device used by the Nixon administration ? would not be invoked . Mr. Carter hoped thereby to dissuade both sides from installing pre-emptive wage and price hikes before controls went into place . Now the President , bowing to changing conditions in the economy , is withdrawing his $50 rebate proposal and also $2 billion worth of investment tax credits for industry . These measures , taken together , would have pumped nearly $14 billion into the economy , adding , in the view of some presidential advisers , to inflationary pressures . The proposals also were unpopular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aides defending the rebate plan down to the wire , may have felt the battle was not worth the political cost . // From page 1 Carter tough on energy , mild on inflation This reduces Mr. Carter 's stimulus program to about $20 billion , devoted almost entirely to creation of public-service jobs and expansion of public-works projects . ' A major aim of the Carter energy program , although details remain subject to change , reportedly is to raise the price of domestic oil substantially to the world price set by the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries . The average price of OPEC oil delivered to the United States is a little more than $14 a barrel , according to petroleum experts , compared with $8.30 for U.S. crude . Removing most price controls from domestic oil would have the effect , White House officials hope , of stimulating new exploration and enforcing conservation . Natural gas prices also would be allowed to rise somewhat . Reportedly the President 's plan would rebate some of these additional costs to consumers , although overall retail prices ? reflecting higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beyond this , Mr. Carter reportedly plans a range of penalties ( taxes on big cars , higher gasoline tax ) to reduce wastage , and benefits ( tax credits for installing insulation or solar heating , rebates for buying small cars ) to encourage energy saving .
