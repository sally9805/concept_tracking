Two hundred years later , much of India 's wildlife ? among the world 's most varied ? faces extinction . Recently the government has taken steps to protect its endangered . species within some 150 sanctuaries . But a bigger problem looms : Six hundred million people demand room for living . Can they and India 's wild creatures survive side by side ? p 300 around his cottage at Kaladhungi , awaiting word of the next kill by a man-eating tiger . But these are imaginings .

The great forests have shrunk under the ax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herds , 10,000 strong , and herd after herd , have diminished to small pockets ; the predators have become the hunted . The Indian cheetah is now extinct , the tiger gravely endangered ; even the birds have dwindled in both numbers and species . So great has been the slaughter of animals , so entrenched the pattern of destruction of habitat , that many came to believe that India 's treasure of wildlife was doomed . Not until the early 1970 's did the central and state governments of India join in the first firm steps to rescue her wildlife . It was very late , but the struggle had begun . During four months in India I visited almost every corner of the subcontinent and talked with scores of persons concerned with its wildlife . I wanted to learn what steps were now being taken to preserve the animals that remain and what the chances were of success . The cost of failure would be great , for India has a remarkable variety of wildlife : some 500 different mammals , 1,200 species of birds , more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fish , amphibians , and reptiles . Some ? such as the blackbuck , the  | Nilgiri tahr , the golden langur , the lion-tailed macaque , the pygmy hog ? are unique to the subcontinent ( pages 307-309 ) . This unusual assemblage of animals began long ago , when India was a separate landmass drifting northward toward Asia . After the continents met , India 's indigenous animals were joined by migrants moving east from Europe and Africa , south from central Asia , and west from China . It became a land that offered a rich variety of habitats : the great sweep of the Himalayas to the north , mangrove swamps along the eastern coast , desert to the west , deciduous forests in the central plateau , reed jungles in the valleys of the Ganges and Brahmaputra . AS EARLY AS 2000 B.C. Hindu sages began to classify this bounty of wildlife , noting the " ovum or seed , " the habitat , the food preferences of hundreds of species . A notion of conservation was introduced in the Hindu precept of ahimsa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B.C. , Buddha , sitting under a pipal tree in what is now the State of Bihar , taught his disciples that a man 's mind must embrace all living things " as a mother cares for her son , her only son ... " Not long after , the Emperor Ashoka issued his Fifth Pillar Edict , perhaps the first conservation law in history . It decreed that animals such as " bats , monkeys , rhinoceroses , porcupines , and tree squirrels " were to be strictly preserved and that " forests must not be burned , either for mischief or to destroy living creatures . " And while Mogul emperors of the 16th and 17th centuries won renown as hunters ( one arranged a month-long hunt with 50,000 beaters ) , they were also keen naturalists . The Emperor Jehangir filled notebook after notebook with observations : how , unlike the birth of most humans , " young elephants are born with their feet first " ; how the clever pied-crested cuckoo deposits its eggs in the nests of babblers , to be cared for by the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Mogul ideal of the sportsman-naturalist ? would reemerge to spur India 's present conservation effort . With the coming of the British raj , colonial sportsmen found a Garden of Eden : " ... wild pig , porcupine ,  | wild fowl , game fowl , and other animals , dear to the sportsman , are to be met with in incredible numbers . " Englishman and raja blasted away . There seemed no end to the game . It was still so within the memory of living men . Dr. Salim Ali , 80 , a small Gandhi-like figure and India 's most renowned ornithologist , remembers : " Forty or fifty years ago , when you traveled by train from Bombay to Ahmadabad , there was hardly a time after you left the settled areas that you did n't see herds of blackbuck . At that time we all shot ; in a morning you could easily bag three or four blackbucks . " And every hunter with any ambition wanted a tiger . Some shot five , ten , thirty . I remember once , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pradesh , I met the Maharaja of Surguja . He was an old man with palsy and braced his rifle on a stick . " I am very happy today , ' he told me . " Why ? ' I asked . " Because today I have shot my 1,100th tiger ! ' " He ended up with 1,157 . " T HE CRACK of the great smoothbores during the days of the raj significantly reduced India 's wildlife , but the maharajas protected game in their preserves , while British civil servants prevented wholesale slaughter in the forests . Disaster came with independence in 1947 . Exultant Indians rejected the old shooting regulations along with colonialism . They began to shoot wildlife everywhere , on private ' ) estates , in sanctuaries , in forest and field . The slaughter was increased when the government , facing food shortages , distributed cropprotection guns to farmers , dooming those animals that lived near cultivated fields . The availability of jeeps led to motorized hunting at night , when hunters fired away at any animal eyes reflected in the beam of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readily available , and farmers learned they could poison not only Apothecary of Asia , the grea believe the animal 's horn posse roamed the entire Ganges dozen individuals remain National Park .

Shoot everything , burn what 's left , destroy the rest . It was our disaster period . You had the same thing in the American West ? in the 1800 's everybody started shooting , and the great herds were destroyed . " Dharmakumarsinhji , 59 , of the Princely House of Bhaunagar , remembers how " war broke out against the animals . Before the reduction was felt , it was too late . It can never again be like it was in the past . " At the same time , thanks to improved health care , India 's population began an extraordinary climb . Whereas it grew by only eighty million from the turn of the century to 1941 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today 's 600 million . Each new mouth cried for food , each new body needed a piece of earth to sleep on , each cook pot required firewood . Between 1900 and today , perhaps half of India 's forests , home for much of its wildlife , vanished . Most was converted to cropland . Into the remaining forests poured millions of domestic livestock , searching for grazing . Protected from slaughter by Hindu belief and tradition , India 's cattle numbered 200 million , most undernourished , many diseased . For India 's wildlife the struggle for survival became a competition with human beings and their livestock for the very basics of life ? food , shelter , space . It is not surprising that the government of India did not recognize the problem and act to remedy it . Independence had been preceded by half a century of political struggle and by World War II ; it had been accompanied by partition , gigantic exchanges of populations , massacres ; it was succeeded by severe economic and social problems , four wars , political uncertainty .

It was through the efforts of such people that the Indian Board for Wild Life was created in 1952 to advise the central and state governments on wildlife conservation problems . But it was not until the end of the 1960 's that things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to many , came in 1969 when the International Union for Conservation of Nature held its triennial convocation in New Delhi . The union is a scientific body with a representation of 100 nations and many individuals . The assemblage of so many natural scientists in the city , their visits to sanctuaries and parks , and the local and international news coverage drew attention to the plight of India 's wildlife . Those Indians already working for conservation were encouraged ; the subject was brought to the attention of those who had not noticed before .  | Prime Minister Indira Gandhi gave the inaugural address , strongly endorsing conservation . Her appearance , many believe , was the vital factor . One Indian participant remembers : " From being a catch phrase , wildlife became a serious commitment of government . The ministers got involved ; all those who had hindered now began to help . " Action followed swiftly . In 1970 India outlawed the shooting of tigers and ordered a census of their population . Since 1972 the central and most state governments have adopted the Wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endangered species , provides stiff penalties for offenders , and lays out the legal framework for enforcement . Money began to move from the center to the states to encourage the development of sanctuaries . In 1973 , spurred by a milliondollar pledge from the World Wildlife Fund , India inaugurated Project Tiger . The species had dwindled from an estimated 40,000 at the turn of the century to 2,000 . Nine existing sanctuaries were designated as tiger reserves , and the central government allocated 4.5 million dollars . " The object , " Project Director K. S. Sankhala told me in New Delhi , " is to start a nucleus for regenerating the species , a sort of series of nurseries for tigers , where they can rest , breed , spread out .

" - CAPT . JAMES FORSYTH , BENGAL STAFF CORPS , IN " THE HIGHLANDS OF CENTRAL INDIA , " 1871 TO CHECK on the progress of Project Tiger , I headed toward Kanha National Park , in the center of India . It was late February , when chital fawns were finding their legs , the peacocks coming into full plumage , the wild boar in full rut . The preserve , founded in British days and later expanded , sits on the western edge of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bisonlike gaur graze unafraid in its meadows . Kanha is , by consensus , among India 's best managed parks . The first morning out on elephant back , I saw a tiger ? a handsome female with four cubs . She let us approach fairly close , then vanished into a bamboo lair . Through the canes I glimpsed a bright red flash , the partly eaten haunch of a fresh kill . Kanha 's tiger population has risen from 31 to 48 in the past few years . H. S. Panwar , field director for Project Tiger at the park , explained why : " The basic problems were first to stop the disturbance caused by logging operations and to move out the villagers and cattle . Then to rebuild the habitat ? allow the grass to grow back , protect it from fire , build dams and water holes for the animals , and , of course , stop shooting of any kind . " Project Tiger funds help achieve these goals , paying for staff additions , roads and dams , and the cost of moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Progress , Mr. Panwar said , had been swift . " The environment responds quickly , and once the forestry operations have ceased and the villages have been shifted , the animals lose their fear . " When an additional fifty square miles was recently added to the park , the tiger population there rose from five to eight . Behind Kanha 's success lie hidden ingredients : a state government and political leaders attuned to the benefits of conservation , relatively low population pressure , and the vigor and diplomatic abilities of both Mr. Panwar and his predecessor . Mr. Panwar had been " only a forester " for ten years . Once he had been posted here . As he roamed the park 's sal forests and hills , something happened : " Thereafter my interest kept coming back here ? to the animals . " Now he 's content safeguarding them . One evening as we sat on the veranda of the guesthouse , I asked him about tigers . I had in mind the late Captain Forsyth 's ferocious portrayal of the beast . " I once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to observe the courtship and mating of the tigress you saw . She and a male lived together , day and night , for a week . There were various displays : The female gave her mating roar and sprayed , the male answered in kind . " it 's quite a rough affair , their mating . One day I came on a kill site and followed the dragline to where the two were . He sniffed her , got excited , gave a mating call , and began to circle her . After some play , they mated . Afterward , they disappeared . " Then I heard the mating call again and the sound of a big scuffle . When I saw them later , their coats were marked by bites and cuts . They kept together for some time , then went their own ways . " The gestation period for a tiger is 95 to 110 days . The newborn are just slightly bigger than dog puppies , and usually number four or five , although the average survival rate is only about two . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the den . In time she will take the cubs out for direct feeding on a kill . " Within the first few months they begin their understudies at hunting ; sometimes they play a hide-and-seek game with their mother . As she conceals herself in the grass . the cubs come searching . She raises her tail . flicks it , then suddenly shifts it , and they learn to pounce and grab . Later the cubs join the mother in the hunt . Sometimes they fail . " The training goes on for one and a half to two years , until the cubs leave the mother . She then may mate again . The cubs often stay together for a time ; they are too inexperienced to establish themselves alone . By three years they are off on their own and start to establish their territories . " Mr. Panwar believes that the survival of the tiger is assured : " There is no question of them being wiped out in preserves like this .  | The question concerns those outside the national parks and sanctuaries . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Mikir Hills in the eastern State of Assam , I found more indications of progress in conservation . I rode on elephant back with Indian tourists through tall elephant grass to the clearings and water holes where animals meet . There were hog deer , swamp deer , barking deer ; wild pigs ; buffalo . Down by the river , wild elephants grazed . But the centerpiece of Kaziranga is the great Indian one-horned rhinoceros ( page 311 ) . Long ago they ranged the length of the Ganges Valley , but the reed jungles they require were converted to cropland . In time most of the remaining rhinos came to dwell in Assam , mainly in Kaziranga . The rhino 's horn is believed to contain wondrous properties as an aphrodisiac and as a medicine , and poachers shot them until they had dwindled to only a few dozen . Tough new enforcement measures ? including guard posts linked by radio , jeep and elephant patrols , and armed foresters ? stopped the slaughter just in time . Today 700 of the rhinos graze the park , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin . Indeed , some observers are concerned that Kaziranga may have become overstocked with these animals . ANHA AND KAZIRANGA are two of India 's success stories , but not every preserve has shared equally in the money and attention or success in resolving long-standing problems . Periyar Wild Life Sanctuary , situated in the hills of the southern State of Kerala , is one of India 's most popular tourist attractions . Perhaps 100,000 visitors a year come to take a  | boat ride around its man-made lake and view the animals on the shore . Among them is one gravely endangered species : the lion-tailed macaque ( page 343 ) . These unobtrusive monkeys once thrived in the Western Ghats , but catchers snared them for the pet trade and their forest homes yielded to farms and tea and black-pepper plantations . Lion-tails probably number fewer than 500 ; perhaps twenty live in Periyar . No detailed census has been attempted . " There is a lack of devoted personnel , a lack of the scientific feeling . We simply can not take an accurate count , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( page 308 ) died in the park of an epidemic of rinderpest , a viral disease probably transmitted by sick cattle passing through . The herd dwindled to about a hundred beasts , although it has now begun to increase . When the park advertised for a fence to keep out domestic livestock , no one bid . The state government rates were too low . The state is currently digging a trench around Periyar to thwart the cattle . Poaching and illegal logging continue : Wild pig , sambar deer , and teak bring good money . Men are posted down the lake , but they lack radios and motors for their boats . " Are they to approach a heavily armed party ? " one officer said . " It is very dangerous . If they close their eyes or run away , who can blame them ? " FOR THE INDIAN WILD ASS , still another gravely endangered species , major problems include poaching , dis ease , and the human taste for salt . The wild ass is a handsome beast ? tawny on top , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spine . Dharmakumarsinhji , when young , had seen them " in the thousands . " Today they number perhaps 720 . Most of them live in the salt-rich Little Rann of Kutch , a scrubby wasteland in western India ( pages 340-41 ) . During the monsoon , from June to October , the Little Rann floods into a broad lake and the wild asses take refuge on the bets , islandlike bits of higher ground . In the dry season , when the Rann becomes a parched desert , they travel to its edges to browse . In 1973 a sanctuary was established for them . It includes  | the rim of the Rann and a narrow belt of adjacent land , covering 1,900 square miles . I came in the dry season . The mornings were cool and clear , and there was sometimes overhead the tracery of migrating demoiselle cranes ; by noon the sun was merciless , the air filled with dragonflies , and mirages turned distant parts of the Rann into blue water .

On other mornings they would already be far out on the Rann , specks of white caught in the slanting rays of the sun . It was the mating season . They stood a lot , grazed a bit , rolled on their backs to relieve irritation . The young suckled . And now and then the herd male , as the select struck a female , would come charging in , steady her with his head , and mount . One day a bachelor male appeared on the horizon . He charged , neighing , toward the herd , trying to cut out a female . The herd male rushed in , they kicked and bit at each other ; the bachelor fled , the herd male in pursuit . Returning , he tried to collect a hero 's reward , selecting one female . She kicked him several times . He gave up and began to lead the herd back toward the croplands .

But their voices are joined each day by the whoops and songs of herdsmen who lead some 7,000 buffalo to feed in the same limited area . The buffalo disturb the birds in their nesting and may destroy food sources . If buffalo were banned , the birds , which have no other such nesting area within hundreds of miles , would benefit . But as the former Maharaja of Bharatpur , who lives nearby , said : " Where could the herdsmen go ? They have plowed up their own grazing land .

The pink-headed duck exists only in the memory of men ; the forest-dwelling whitewinged wood duck is now rarely seen , its numbers unknown . Only a hunch by Dr. Salim Ali led the Bombay Natural History Society to circularize for information on Jerdon 's courser , a small ground-living bird , not sighted in 76 years . There was no response . But even when a species is known to be slipping into extinction , help is often slow to come . The great Indian bustard , three feet tall and weighing as much as forty pounds , is such a creature ( page 337 ) . I found the rare bird some distance from Bikaner , in the desert area of west Rajasthan . Villagers described its habits : " In the morning it looks for food ; at noon it goes and sits in the shade . It never sits on a tree . At night it simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ females give one or two three-inch eggs , generally one . The birds remain here throughout the year . The meat is good , especially in summer . " The bustard eats dung beetles and lizards , but principally the leaves and flowers of the kerad bush . During the days I observed them , solitary males strolled the meadow ? sometimes only a head and neck moving above the grass like a periscope . They moved heavily , seemingly pompously , like Colonel Blimps strolling with some distaste down Piccadilly . So slow are the birds that they can easily be shot with muzzle-loaders , or even killed at takeoff by hurling a large stick at them . Poachers often approach on camels or in jeeps ; nothing seems to frighten the bustard . Protection is marginal . The local forest guard 's first responsibility is to protect a fenced-off area so that some grass can remain when the drought comes and all other grass dies or has been eaten .

That night as the Bikaner Express rumbled toward New Delhi , I pondered what I had seen . Clearly , there had been gains , but losses continued in many areas . What were the chances of the government holding its forests , providing more and better-trained staff , above all checking the population growth ? " What of thee I dig out , let that quickly grow ever , Let me not hit thy vitals , or thy heart . " - VEDIC HYMN TO EARTH , 2000 B.C.

Mr. Seth believes , as power requirements are met and the consciousness of the wildlife problem grows , such projects will taper off . But India 's conservationists see another threat : While forests continue to shrink , demand for wood products soars . Last year India produced 13 million cubic yards of industrial wood ; by the year 2000 , demand is expected to reach 65 million cubic yards . As forests can not be expanded , Mr. Seth said , the only method of meeting demand is to turn to intensive forest practices ? cutting millions of acres of old mixed forests and replacing them with plantations of quickgrowing species . Conservationists protest that wildlife requires the old mixed forests with their variety of shelter and food , and that the new forests ? teak , eucalyptus , and pine ? provide poor habitat . " Eucalyptus is the worst , " one told me . " Even the birds will not come to those trees ; they hold no berries . " Mr. Seth disagrees .

" -A MAHOUT SONG , ASSAM , 1976 IPLING WROTE of the elephant K catchers in The Jungle Book : " What Little Toomai liked was to scramble up bridle-paths that only an elephant could take . . . the glimpses of the wild elephants browsing miles away . . . the blinding warm rains , when all the hills and valleys smoked : the beautiful misty mornings when nobody knew where they would camp that night . " The elephant catchers of Assam still pursue the wild herds , capturing some three hundred each year . Most are sold to traders from the State of great anim , and Khaga : permitted to are almost I joined t at Dabaka d en recently fore and afi catchers we bing them w them lullabi ( it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in turn at the great animal fairs , the Sonepur , Singheswar , and Khagaria melas . As elephants seldom are permitted to breed in captivity , the wild herds are almost the only source . I joined the catchers in the hills of Assam , at Dabaka depot , a cluster of tents . Half a dozen recently captured elephants were staked fore and aft with ropes to huge pegs . The catchers were feeding them sugarcane , rubbing them with grass and leaves , and singing them lullabies . " Come on , hati , see how nice it will be if you become tame , the rubbings , the daily bath , the nice food ; quit fighting , hati ! " When an elephant struck at a man with its trunk , the man struck back with a stick , then resumed the rubbing and singing . As the elephants became more docile , the men began to teach them a score or more of commands : Ageth ! ( Forward ) , Pichu ! ( Backward ) , Chai ! ( Circle ) , Tere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg ) , Biri ! ( Lift with the trunk ) , Dhar ! ( Catch with the trunk ) . Then one morning my party of catchers left for the Mikir Hills . They rode two to a koonkie ? a trained elephant . When the Sacred but not safe , the mugger crocodile , shown here at the Delhi Zoological Park , faces extinction in its marsh and river habitats . Hindus worship muggers kept in temple pools , but the state-protected reptile wins no such grace from hunters seeking the valuable skins .  | quarry was found , the master would sit on the koonkie 's neck , give the commands , hurl the great lasso . His assistant , clutching a rope , would stand on the koonkie 's rump , jabbing it with a long metal-tipped spear to urge it on . Within afew days we were deep into the hills , feeling both the hard raised spine and soothing gait of our mounts . We slept under canvas , with leaves for mattresses and fires at each end of the tents to keep away wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our koonkies by dawn . Sometimes there were green clouds of parakeets in the mornings , and at dusk swarms of bats . Now and then we heard the jabber of monkeys , perhaps warning of tigers . Three times we came on wild elephants ; three times we failed to catch . Our only hope was to find young or female elephants somewhat apart . Instead , each time a great tusker saw us and challenged . We stood no chance against such wild males ; they would have killed the strongest of our male koonkies . We pushed on and on . Often the mahouts sang . In one song a girl protests that the love between a boy and a girl can provide as much satisfaction as the feeling that comes from controlling a great elephant . In another song a poet cautions that life is full of troubles like the dark night sky , and that happiness comes only like lightning , briefly , for half a second . And that amount of happiness , the poet says , is sufficient . On the eighth morning we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wallow where the elephants had played . On and on . But we never caught up . " The elephant keeps moving , " one mahout said . " He goes and he goes . " On the tenth day we came down out of the hills into tea plantations ; it was warm and sunny , and the workers paused to watch us pass . The hunters began to sing ; the younger men called to girls at a respectful distance . The days in the hills , the up and down , the sliding on mud had punished the elephants . We camped in a fallow field where the hunters would refit and rest their animals . In a few days they would resume the hunt . It might be a month before they succeeded ; they might not succeed at all . Life , the poet said , is like the dark night sky . The days in the hills had been special , something apart , yet even there I could not escape the struggle between India 's wildlife and its people . Now and then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signaled another settlement in what was jungle . We had camped one night in the ruins of a village attacked by angry elephants , and each day were eagerly assisted by tribesmen who wanted cropraiding elephants caught ; the very scarcity of our prey indicated their decline . UNTIL THE END of World War II Assam was thinly populated , remote , a fit place for a Kipling tale . But thereafter came industrialization . The state is now India 's largest producer of oil and tea , and forest industries have been accelerated . People from Bihar moved in for the jobs . To man 's changes were added nature 's . In 1950 a catastrophic earthquake struck the state , shifting the terrain , changing the course of the Brahmaputra River . This , along with loss of forest cover , has led to heavier flooding than normal , and to the inundation of villages . The people are invading the forested hill slopes , seeking new homes . Chief Conservator P. Barua told me that thousands of acres of forestland had been lost to such settlement . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to stop it . " When we notice encroachment , we first give notice to vacate . Then we take police and elephants to the site . The police drive out the encroachers ; the elephants demolish their houses . " Where do the people go ? That 's the problem . I can only say : They came from somewhere , let them go back . " Conservationists believe that a key to preserving wildlife lies in the education of the young . The old can not be changed . Many state governments are planning to introduce the subject into school curriculums . And private organizations such as World Wildlife Fund ? India are making parallel efforts . In 1966 the World Wildlife Fund asked Fatesinghrao Gaekwad , former Maharaja of Baroda , to set up a fund appeal in India . Some were surprised . True , he loved the outdoors and was a successful industrialist , but he was also a noted hunter . Indeed , the year before , Fatesinghrao had gone on a two-month safari to Africa with his father , the late maharaja , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Fatesinghrao came back from Africa with more than trophies . He also had 4,000 feet of motion-picture film . He spent day after day at the editing table , and something happened during that sustained viewing : " The futility of shooting , of destroying wildlife , came to me , " he told me during a visit to his bungalow in New Delhi . Thus he was delighted to take on the World Wildlife Fund job . He began to solicit fellow industrialists ; with 21 other Indians , he joined the World Wildlife Fund 's exclusive 1001 Club , founded by H.R.H. Prince Bernhard , The Prince of the Netherlands . Members pledge $10,000 each . " Today we have now passed the hand-tomouth level of existence , " Fatesinghrao told me . The organization has a capital fund of 123,750 dollars , which is set aside to earn income . Annual membership in World Wildlife Fund ? India has climbed to 2,000 . Yet the fund 's effort ? like that of India 's other conservation groups ? is described by one official as " a pebble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripple effect . " An example of the ripple approach is the fund 's plan to introduce nature clubs , starting with pilot programs in Gujarat and Maharashtra . " We hope to have a hundred clubs active within a year , " one official said . " And 500 within 18 months . " The budget for all of India : $33,000 . The staff : two headquarters officers and one for each state . It was to the Gir Forest in Gujarat that I journeyed last . It seemed to combine all the ingredients of India 's wildlife struggle . The forest , which has dwindled from 1,000 to 500 square miles since the turn of the century , is one of the few left in the state . Signs of xerification , or drying up , were apparent . Good grasses have been grazed away and , in many places , have yielded to  | unpalatable ones . Some streams have dried and the water table has dropped . For years the forest has sheltered some 200 Asiatic lions , the last of a subspecies that once ranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their 25,000 cattle and buffalo ; and , during periods of drought , up to 80,000 domestic animals brought in from the surrounding countryside . The struggle for survival in Gir was desperate . The lions killed the Maldharis ' cattle for food ; the Maldharis in turn drove the lions from their kills , and sometimes poisoned them . The cattle , meanwhile , overgrazed the forest and trampled the very earth , speeding up the process of xerification , ruinous to all . The state government is now acting to save the forest and its wildlife from the impending destruction . The Maldharis and their cattle are slowly being moved out , and a low rubbleand-hedge wall , 103 miles long , has been built to mark clearly the sanctuary boundaries , and to keep out cattle from surrounding villages . Forest officials report that the lion and other wildlife populations seem more stable , that grass is coming back in some areas , and that prospects are generally good . The Maldharis , they reported , are finding a better life in their new homes . T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save wildlife . I visited one of the nesses , vil lages , still in the forest . It was early morning , when the mist lifts slowly from the valleys and there is the smell of cooking fires . The men take their staves and axes and lead their herds from thornbush stockades . Young women follow , collecting the droppings , which they mix with topsoil and sell to village farmers . This , along with ghee , a cooking oil made from the milk of their buffalo , provides their income . Hand churns were already busy when the last herds vanished into the forest , leaving plumes of dust . Then I went to the settlement of Chotili , some 30 miles away . There were 90 families . Each had received a concrete-block house , 20 bighas of land , seed , instructions in farming , and an iron rod around which a plow could be built . Their community seemed set in a vast , flat sea of cropland . Most found their new life in some ways better . There was a school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their 8 acres , there was a town with stores nearby . But water and food for their cattle were in short supply . " There is only one well , and there is no wasteland to graze ? all around are farms . " Since arriving three years ago . half of their 1,800 cattle have died . The men still wore their traditional costumes : golden earrings , sometimes three to an ear ; white tunics , embroidered and pleated : jodhpur trousers , loose to the knees , then tight . Yet something was missing . Not until later did I remember : the long staves and  | handmade axes of the forest herdsmen . Their lives are changing , their future uncertain . So too is that of the Gir and its lions . A Canadian researcher concluded that the lions prey so heavily on buffalo that once the livestock is moved out , the lions will lack adequate food . Park officials disagree . And there is the weather , which man can not control . The last monsoon had been heavy , and so there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Gir Forest guards , reinforced by police , have been able to check the annual invasion of starving cattle and desperate herders . But the memory of 1973 , when the monsoon failed , remains : " With drought came a flood of men and animals ? a thousand head of cattle arriving every day for a month , continually coming . It was July . There was nothing we could do . " WHEREVER I WENT in India , people concerned with wildlife gave major credit for progress to the " P.M. " ? Prime Minister Indira Gandhi . In time it became clear that much that happened could be traced to the open door she keeps for friends of wildlife . Despite even the current political tensions , she hears pleas and , if they are worthy , writes a letter , places a phone call , makes a visit . I called on her at her office in Parliament  | House . She had , I knew , grown up as an only child , and her childhood had been invaded by the turbulence of India 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My parents and relatives , most of the family , were often being imprisoned . Our house was raided by the police and things confiscated . " She found companionship and a sense of peace with nature . She developed a " love for stones no less than trees , and for animals of all kinds . " There were pets : horses , a bear , dogs , a handsome blackbuck kept " for a very long time , " until it jabbed one too many guests with its spiraled horns . There were camping trips in Kashmir , and at home the warm nights when everyone slept outdoors . She remembered how her father , the late Jawaharlal Nehru , who was to become India 's first Prime Minister , would point out the constellations and name each . She learned that " when you know a thing by name , you feel much closer to it ; even with a bird , if you know it is a robin , there is a different relationship . " In time she developed a certain philosophy : " If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he is not at home with himself either . " Of her own efforts , she said : " It is n't at all easy to get any of this done ; you have to pursue it all the time . Even when we make a sanctuary , there are sometimes problems . At  | Keoladeo Ghana we have a problem because there 's no proper wall around it . Dachigam has been injured by a sheep farm . I 'm told most of the stags have gone away . " But I do n't think I have a choice . If you do n't do it now , there wo n't be any wildlife left . And when you are head of government , you have to deal with all the problems more or less simultaneously . " The personal intervention of the Prime Minister is a fortunate thing for India 's wildlife , yet her individual importance may also indicate a weakness in the governmental institutions set up to preserve wildlife . " If she goes , " one conservationist said , " then I think we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart . " The Delhi Zoological Park is spacious and pleasant , in part because of Mrs. Gandhi 's personal intervention . There is a cheetah , but African ; male peacocks that dance with tails fanned ; Manipur brow-antlered deer , whose wild kin number fewer than 25 . But its most popular inhabitant is Jimmy the tiger . He stalks a large enclosure , often concealing himself behind grass . Now and then , when people stop before the enclosure , the keeper obligingly calls " Jim-M-M-Y ! " The large and beautiful cat comes charging out of the bamboo and , with a heart-stopping roar , plunges into the surrounding moat . He looks at the viewers , paddles back , and retreats into his minijungle . The audience is delighted . TT IS POSSIBLE that someday all of India 's larger wildlife will , like Jimmy , be confined to zoos or extended zoological parks such as the Gir Forest . I thought of all those people who had struggled so long to prevent that : Salim Ali , Dharmakumarsinhji , Krishnan , and all the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States scientist with much experience in India told me tersely , " Too little , too late . " Another foresaw : " They 'll keep what 's in their preserves , nothing more . " Dr. Karan Singh had answered the question in words befitting a poet : " If there is any wildlife left in India in the year 2000 , it will be because of what we are doing now . " The truth is that the future is uncertain . One can only look for signs . FEW DAYS before I was to leave India , I happened to meet Mr. V. B. Singh , chief wildlife warden for the State of Uttar Pradesh . His is the most populated state in India , with 88 million people . So intense is the pressure for land that the state plans to compel the settlement of its 3,000 nomads and their 10,000 animals . There is simply no spare grazing land for migrants . To accommodate the reluctant settlers , the state will carve 1,200 acres from a state forest . But Mr. Singh was quite optimistic : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He cited increasing funds , a greater consciousness of the problem , the expansion of sanctuaries , and the establishment of 116 square miles of Corbett National Park as a sanctum sanctorum , free from all disturbance , even logging . " The number of tigers in Corbett has reached the saturation point , " he said , " about 55 . And they are spilling out . " Some , because of lack of food , loss of habitat , or because of injury or old age , have turned to cattle lifting , even man-eating . " We have three man-eaters in Uttar Pradesh . One has taken five lives and has been officially declared a man-eater and condemned . The other two have taken only one person each . " Twenty days ago we began to gather information about the man-eater , and a senior forest officer has been delegated to destroy it . He is our chief conservator , an old shikari hunter and a fine shot . He is now staying close to his office in Lucknow , awaiting word of the next human kill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless turn of the seasons , and for both its wildlife and its people , the struggle often remains one for survival . Swinging free in captivity , a lion-tailed macaque ? a species gravely endangered ? is protected in a zoo . In the wild the reclusive monkeys exist only in small patches of dense forest . India has declared her resolve to preserve her wildlife heritage . If she fails , humanity is the loser . Wrote Kipling in The Jungle Book of Mowgli 's bond with his animal friends : " We be of one blood , ye and I. "
