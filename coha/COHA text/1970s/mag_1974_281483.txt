For more than two decades East Germany was the pariah among nations , its huge foreign ministry building in East Berlin underused because only a dozen countries , all Communist , maintained full diplomatic relations with it . The West not only denied its existence as a nation but refused to call it the German Democratic Republic-its official name - insisting that it was nothing more than an extension of the Soviet Zone of Occupation . Then five years ago , Chancellor Willy Brandt relaxed Bonn 's opposition to the East Berlin regime , and the G.D.R . began its long journey in from the cold . Nation after nation accorded it formal recognition , until last week the most important holdout fell into line . In a three-minute ceremony in Washington , the U.S. became the 110th country to establish diplomatic relations with the G.D.R . <P> U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Arthur Hartman and East German Diplomat Herbert Suss signed a four-page document formalizing relations . Rolf Sieber , 44 , an economics professor with no previous diplomatic experience , was named East Germany 's first Ambassador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , former Republican Senator from Kentucky and Ambassador to India and Nepal ( 1955-56 ) , was chosen as the U.S. <P> envoy to the G.D.R . <P> No Responsibility . Both nations actually were prepared to hold the ceremony at the end of July . The U.S. <P> balked , however , when the East Germans began interfering with West German traffic on the roadways leading to West Berlin . The harassment by the Communists was in protest against Bonn 's opening a branch of the West German Federal Environmental Protection Agency in West Berlin . Only after Secretary of State Henry Kissinger made it clear to the Soviets that he held them responsible for the East German action in violation of prior East-West agreements and the spirit of detente did the flow of traffic return to normal . <P> During the talks , the U.S. demanded that the East Germans agree to compensate the victims of Nazism . East Berlin insisted that as a " new state " it shared no responsibility for Nazi atrocities , but the U.S. refused to budge . The G.D.R . finally pledged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property taken by the Nazis . While it is too early to estimate what the claims might cost the G.D.R. , West Germany has already voluntarily paid out about $15 billion to claimants . <P> The East Berlin regime probably made a concession in order to participate in the rising tide of trade between Eastern Europe and the U.S. It may have also been seeking a respectability that it feels it will gain by winning America 's recognition . But East Germany may discover that respectability could be slow in coming as long as it remains one of Europe 's most repressive police states , still finding it necessary to limit the freedom of its 17 million citizens by walls , barbed wire and the presence of 20 Soviet divisions .
