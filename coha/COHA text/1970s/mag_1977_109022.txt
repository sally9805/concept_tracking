The 14th annual National Lefty-Righty amateur golf tournament was about to begin , and the teams teeing off early  --  each consisting of a lefthander and his right-handed partner  --  were fanning out beneath the tall , skinny pines of the Myrtle Beach National Golf Club . Watching them , Ed Bullock , the club 's silver-haired head pro . confided , " You can usually tell which of these guys are the lefthanders . When they walk , they tend to flap their hands . " // It was tempting to trust Bullock in the matter , even though he happened to be a righthander himself . After all , the National Association of Left-handed Golfers , the 1,200-member organization that was sponsoring the Lefty-Righty tournament , had selected the same South Carolina club as site of its all-lefthander national championships the year before , meaning that the place had twice now been overrun by swarms of lefties . And this had given Bullock ample opportunity to observe the breed . // The trouble was , what he said about lefthanders was not being borne out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men passing before him were indistinguishable as to hand preference , just another group of golfers decked out in pastels and polyesters . There was not a telltale wrist movement anywhere to be seen . After a while Bullock turned and headed back for the clubhouse . He gave a small shrug . // " For some reason they 're just not flapping today . " he said . // To the estimated 90% of mankind that perform life 's essential chores with the right hand , the other 10% have always been an accursed lot . Lefthanders come in all shapes and sizes , and their ranks have included such disparate figures as Michelangelo , Jack the Ripper and Jerry Ford  --  and they have been treated with uniform derision down through the ages . The Bible , for example , repeatedly equates left-handedness with evil while associating the right hand with truth and virtue . The English tongue is equally unkind , it being no linguistic accident that our words sinister and dexterity are derived from the Latin for left ( sinister ) and right ( dexter ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , studies frequently citing them as being uncommonly disposed to alcoholism , crime and suicide . Lefthanders are also widely thought to be clumsy , although this could have something to do with the fact that many of the things they grapple with daily  --  doorknobs , zippers , subway turnstiles  --  seem deliberately designed to make life tough for them . The righthander is clearly favored in every way . You raise your right hand for such honorable purposes as taking an oath or voting but you are properly put off by left-handed compliments . No wonder that at the first hint of sinistrality in a youngster , elders in most cultures have cracked the offending left hand with a ruler or wrapped it in the nearest tobacco pouch . // Given all the wrongs they endure in daily life , it might seem cause for uncontrolled jubilation among lefthanders that they sometimes have a better time of it in sport . Lefties are different from righties , and this can give them advantages on the playing field much appreciated by sinistrals like Casey Stengel , who found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profession of dentistry . As Casey told it , he was working on a patient in the Western Dental College in Kansas City , using tools made for righthanders , when an instructor burst in and cried in horror , " You 're a lefthander , a lefthander ! " Years later , after succeeding as a big-league outfielder and manager , Stengel felt secure enough to confess , " I was a left-handed dentist who made people cry . " // But sport imposes on lefthanders its own hardships , including some refinements of those suffered generally . Forced conversions ? Among the many natural lefthanders coaxed and cajoled into competing right-handed are Ben Hogan , Carmen Basilio and Ken Rosewall , each of whom might have fared even better had he been allowed to go his southpaw ways . Inhospitable equipment ? Any left-handed outdoorsman will attest to how his made-for-righty shotgun never fails to eject its shells in his face . Stereotypes ? Left-handed athletes , it is said , tilt their heads to the left . They put diabolical spins on the ball  --  any ball . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , they flap their wrists . // The most durable left-handed stereotype in sport has it that they are , to use a suitably hoary term , daffy . Ask tennis oldtimers about lefties and they will pass over less colorful southpaws like Jaroslav Drobny and Neale Fraser . Instead , they single out as " typical " the legendary Art Larsen . a lefthander of the 1950s remembered for superstitiously tapping opponents during matches ( so insistently that Gardnar Mulloy once had to vault the net to get away ) and for affecting bizarre getups ( striding onto the court for a match wearing a shirt with the hanger still in it ) . And football people revel in relating the eccentricities of left-handed Quarterback Frankie Albert , conveniently ignoring that he was a fine passer . They will tell of the time that Albert was quarterbacking Stanford against Nebraska in the 1941 Rose Bowl and held up the game to watch an airplane fly by . Or of his curious habit , during his years with the San Francisco 49ers , of calling the same play seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Albert , by now the club 's coach , was visiting the home of 49er owner Lou Spadia and sneaked away to climb to the roof , whereupon he issued a bloodcurdling yell and leaped 20 feet into the swimming pool . It remains for Spadia to put all this into proper perspective . He says . " The crazy lefthander could have broken his head . " // The notion of the lefthander as quintessential oddball has taken strongest hold in the game played and managed by ex-dentist Stengel . The place of lefthanders in baseball is evident in the nicknames created just for them , a lexicon that includes portsider , forkhander and , of course , southpaw , a term coined in the late 19th century in Chicago because pitchers in a local ball park faced the setting sun , meaning that their left arms were to the south . Breathe the word southpaw today and some oldtimers still think of the hard-drinking , hooky-playing Rube Waddell , whose plaque in the Hall of Fame identifies him as a " colorful left-handed pitcher . " These fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the most important generalization about lefthanders is one that people usually neglect to make  --  the possiblity that as a group they may be the best natural athletes . Everybody knows that Babe Ruth batted and threw left-handed but few seem to appreciate that lefties  --  just 10% of the population , remember  --  more recently have been achieving high stature in sport after sport . Bill Russell , once basketball 's dominant figure , is left-handed and so is Iuliana Semenova , the 7-foot-plus Russian who was the leading woman player at the ' 76 Olympics . Running Back Gale Sayers , among the best ever at that position , is left-handed , and no current NFL quarterback is more proficient than lefthander Ken Stabler . Of the world 's 10 best tennis players , no fewer than four  --  Jimmy Connors , Manuel Orantes , Guillermo Vilas and Roscoe Tanner  --  are lefties. // The list goes on . West Indian Gary Sobers , cricket 's greatest all-rounder , is left-handed . So is Bud Muehleisen , six-time international open singles racquetball champion . Likewise Steve Mizerak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anthony and Patty Costello , the same among the world 's bowlers . Young Greg Louganis , everybody 's choice as diving 's next superstar , is left-handed and so is sport 's foremost transsexual , Renee Richards , Bill Hartack , Dave Cowens , Mark Spitz and Dorothy Hamill  --  lefthanders all . The world 's greatest athlete ? Montreal Olympic decathlon champion and world-record holder Bruce Jenner is a southpaw , naturally . // Give them anything like a fair shake , and those crazy , bowlegged , injury-prone and , yes , awkward lefthanders obviously do rather well . Of course , they get a far fairer shake in some areas than others . // " It happens all the time , " says Ken Stabler . " A guy will come up to me in a bar or somewhere and say . ' Hey , Ken , I 'm a lefthander , too . ' And it means something to me . I do n't care how obnoxious he might be . I think , hey , maybe he 's not such a bad Joe . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk of a " bond " suggests , lefthanders are conscious of being a minority and an oppressed one at that . And while they have not taken to the streets in sinistral force , some of them have been known to joke about drafting a " bill of lefts , " while others have been moved to wear T shirts inscribed LEFTHANDERS OF THE WORLD UNITE . It is in this spirit of unity that a Manhattan . Kans. beer distributor named Dean Campbell launched Lefthanders International , an organization that puts out a quarterly magazine and urges members to say " true " instead of " right . " It may sound frivolous , but Campbell has struck a responsive chord in some 3,000 fellow lefties who pay $12 a year to belong to his organization . // Still , the meaningful breakthroughs are few . It is a positive development , for instance , that fewer children are called " Lefty " these days . Similarly , today 's parents and teachers hesitate to make children " change hands . " having been scared off by evidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Another sign of the times is the proliferation of emporiums around the U.S. like the Left Hand , primarily a mail-order concern on the 10th floor of a loft building on Manhattan 's West Side that does a brisk business in objects designed for lefties , including corkscrews that turn to the left , a large selection of special scissors and instruction books for the southpaw embroiderer . " It makes me mad the way everything is designed for righthanders , " says June Gittleson , the left-handed proprietress. // Scratch left-handed athletes and most will be found , like Gittleson , to harbor pet grievances . The Detroit Pistons ' Bob Lanier is tired of bumping elbows with righthanders at the dinner table . The San Diego Padres ' Randy Jones plaintively wishes that some waitress would  --  just once  --  put his drinking glass on the left . And Jimmy Connors tells of actually having to concentrate in order to discharge one of life 's basic amenities . " When I 'm shaking hands , sometimes I put my left hand out . " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The burden of inhabiting a right-handed world prompts Philadelphia Phillie southpaw Tug McGraw to keep a mental checklist in which he divides objects between those that are " fair " to lefties ( ladders , water glasses , diving boards ) and those that are " prejudiced " ( auto ignitions , dial phones ) . Another aggrieved lefty , Dallas Cowboy Defensive Tackle Larry Cole , waxes mildly militant over the fact that handwriting goes from left to right , dooming the southpaw to a smudged hand as he writes . // " We ought to be writing right to left . " Cole says indignantly . " That 's why lefties turn their arms around to the top to write  --  so they can pull the pen across the page . Well . I refuse to do it . " // Often enough , the southpaw has a scarcely less vexing time of it in his own sport . There are some shotguns and bolt-action rifles that lefthanders can operate without making like contortionists , but these are usually available only on special order  --  and at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mittens and most automobile tools are also made-for-righty . There are plenty of left-handed baseball gloves on the market , but problems occur here , too : Aunt Sarah can be counted on to give her sinistral nephew a right-handed glove for Christmas . // There is , in addition , the problem of instruction . Most how-to films and books are produced for you-know-who , forcing southpaws to translate every " right " into " left " and to stand in front of mirrors wearing perplexed expressions . Los Angeles Dodger Broadcaster Vin Scully , a lefthander , swore off golf books the way some people do cigarettes . " It drove me crazy trying to figure out what those books were talking about , " he says . Group instruction is no better . Even when instructors bother to offer special help , the lefthander wishes they would n't ; it only means the righthanders in class will glare at him for wasting their time . // Baltimore Wide Receiver Glenn Doughty recalls that when he was a running back at Michigan , Coach Bo Schembechler required him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than conformity . Doughty is free to assume his natural lefty stance with the Colts , but the NFL was not exactly quick to overcome its prejudice against sinistral quarterbacks , one that Frankie Albert was practically alone in defying a generation ago . One reason for the taboo was an understandable reluctance to entrust a team to somebody who could be counted on to be crazy . Another was the belief that a lefthander 's spiral was hard to handle  --  assuming , of course , that he got the ball anywhere near the receiver . // Everything considered , it is not surprising that Stabler began his football career as a receiver . But his arm was so good that a Pee Wee coach finally relented and made him a quarterback . Stabler 's stardom at Alabama and Oakland has helped spark a boomlet in southpaw quarterbacks , among them his Oakland understudy David Humm , Seattle 's Jim Zorn , New Orleans ' Bobby Douglass and Michigan 's Rick Leach . Stabler insists , " If anything , being a lefty was a very slight advantage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defense . And that 's nonsense about the spirals . Biletnikoff and those guys are going to catch the ball no matter how it spirals . " // For all the apparent enlightenment , Jim Del Gaizo is able to claim that Cincinnati Coach Paul Brown cut him in 1971 because " he could n't take to the idea of a left-handed quarterback . He just belonged to the old school of NFL coaches . " And it is significant that Stabler takes the ball from center with his right hand on top , exactly as a righty would . While he does not remember exactly who taught him ( " It happened somewhere along the line " ) , it was presumably done to avoid mix-ups with right-handed centers . What makes this ironic is that Oakland Center Dave Dalby is a natural lefty who snaps the ball right-handed on everything but kicks , having been converted by his coaches at UCLA. // But football is a veritable Utopia for southpaws compared to golf , which is why there is a National Association of Left-handed Golfers staging tournaments like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NALG is unhappy that Ben Hogan , Phil Rodgers and many other natural southpaws switched to right-hand play . It yearns in vain for the arrival of a " left-handed Nicklaus , " but has come no closer so far than New Zealander Bob Charles , a PGA veteran whose brightest moment was when he won the 1963 British Open in a playoff against the turncoat Rodgers . So heady was the win that participants in an NALG tournament in California delivered sentimental speeches hailing Charles as " our champion . " // One reason for " turning around " lefthanders is the longstanding unavailability of left-handed clubs . Thanks partly to NALG pressure on manufacturers , there is now a wider selection . Because club pros often are the ones selling the clubs , it is not surprising to find some of them increasingly disposed to let youngsters play left-handed . But other instructors still turn southpaws around in the genuine belief it will improve their game . They argue that golf courses the world over are laid out to favor righthanders and that the switchee will benefit from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Hogan himself , in his book Power Golf , denies that golf-course architecture necessarily favors righthanders and blames his boyhood conversion on misinformed friends who advised him that lefties never made good golfers . Says Hogan , " At that age I was gullible enough to believe them and to make the change , but I would n't now . " At any rate , if it does help having one 's strong side into the shot , why do n't these same instructors switch natural righthanders to southpaws ? As it happens , Bob Charles is the reverse of Hogan , a natural righty who took up the game left-handed simply because that was how both his parents played it . // Left-handed discus men have problems , too . They throw from circles usually laid out in such a way , says Bruce Jenner , that the wind " forces the lefthander 's throw to dive . You might lose anywhere from five to 10 feet . " The ultimate in discrimination , however , is to be found in polo , which has adopted a rule that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enacted by the U.S. Polo Association in 1973 , was seen as a logical extension of the hallowed right-of-way rule that players meeting head on must carry the ball on the right side of the pony. // " It 's a safety measure to avoid collisions , " says John Oxley , a prime mover at the Boca Raton ( Fla. ) polo grounds . " There 's nothing more sacred in polo than the right of way . " Much the same thing could have been accomplished by ruling that players must carry the ball on the left side , but that might have logically led to the banning of righthanders . And things just do n't happen that way . // It is true , of course , that lefties have been able to exploit the element of surprise in some sports . Among their victims have been : // ? Those hockey players flattened by the Boston Bruins ' Wayne Cashman , a lefthander and accomplished NHL brawler , who says , " The key to a hockey fight is the first punch . When you 're a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps . " // ? Dolph Schayes , who toward the end of his NBA career had a lot of trouble guarding a young Bill Russell . Not until Russell 's third season , as the Boston Celtic star finished shooting a free throw , did Schayes sidle up to him and say in honest surprise , " Damn , Bill , I did n't know you were left-handed. " // ? A husky bartender in Wellsville , Utah , who was beaten in arm wrestling by Dick Motta , a little fellow who would go on to become an NBA coach . Motta had his right arm in a sling , and the bartender , not suspecting he was up against a southpaw , charitably agreed to wrestle left-handed . " Needless to say , I killed him , " recalls Motta. // ? The many trout reeled in by Lefty ( Bernard ) Kreh , outdoors editor for the Baltimore Sun . " If you go up a stream , righthanders are all casting the same way , " he says . " Lefties cast into places the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody , southpaw fencers are so hard to handle that they make up perhaps one-fourth of the sport 's top performers , including some  --  and this is a switch in every sense  --  who convert to southpaw . The main impetus for the practice seems to have come from Guiseppe Mangiarotti , an Italian fencing master of the 1920s who had two sons and a daughter , all righthanders . He trained the daughter and son Edoardo as lefties  --  and Edoardo went on to become one of the most accomplished swordsmen in fencing history . // Southpaws who play tennis enjoy an advantage that the best of them , Connors , unblinkingly reckons at " about 5% . " Befuddled opponents generally agree that southpaws put more spin on their serves and in general play a wristier game . The lefty is further helped by the fact that crucial points are served in ad court , when he is serving to the righty 's backhand . And if the righthander is serving , it is to the lefty 's forehand , presumably his strength . // All of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young boy in Australia was taught by his father to play right-handed even though he wrote and threw a ball lefty . The throwing motion being virtually the same as the serve , it is no surprise that the latter became Rosewall 's chief weakness . " In those days there was a tendency to force kids to use the right hand , " he says wistfully . " I 've often wondered if my serve would have been better had I played left-handed . " In that event , perhaps his splendid backhand might have suffered . // In basketball , the lefthander theoretically has no better than a mixed time of it , because on offense he is apt to be dribbling with his strong hand opposite the defender 's right hand . But opponents swear that southpaws are given to sleight of hand ; Coach Motta notes that , for whatever reason , some of the NBA 's best alltime playmakers , Guy Rodgers , Lenny Wilkens and Nate Archibald , have been lefties . And on defense , everything works to the lefty 's advantage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maryland 's Lefty ( Charles ) Driesell , notes of Russell , " When he was blocking a shot , he went up with his left hand and was automatically on the side the righthander was shooting from . " Russell , of course , was celebrated as the game 's greatest shot blocker. // Lefthanders may enjoy such advantages that they sometimes create new hardships for themselves . It happens in the prize ring , where everybody complains about the difficulty of " solving " southpaws . The result is that lefthanders experience heartwarming successes in the amateur ranks but have trouble getting fights as pros . Confronted by what amounts to a freeze-out , their managers usually turn southpaws around , which is how Basilio came to be a right-handed world champion  --  a two-fisted one , to be sure  --  as both a welterweight and a middleweight . Few pure , unreclaimed southpaws have ever won world titles , none the heavyweight crown . // It is against overwhelming odds , then , that Tyrone Everett , a wispy , cherub-faced southpaw from Philadelphia , has moved near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew we were taking a chance , " says Trainer Jimmy Arthur , referring to his refusal to turn Everett around . " But we figured Tyrone was so young-looking , people would think they could beat him . " At that , the fast , hard-punching Everett has had to scramble to get fights , journeying to San Francisco , Honolulu and Caracas to take on hometown favorites , and has repeatedly had to accept the short end of the purse . Despite this , Everett won 34 straight before losing a highly controversial decision to WBC champion Alfredo Escalera in a November title match . // Lefthanders in boxing are shunned even by one another . It is an antipathy that Everett himself expressed one afternoon before a workout in Philadelphia 's Juniper Street gym . " The problem is you do n't see other southpaws much and they look funny , " he said . " You see that left hand coming around at you and you ca n't get away in time . It just looks strange . " // Everett was not speaking hypothetically . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bout with Mexico 's Luis Madrid ( whom he later kayoed ) . At the time Madrid was fighting from a southpaw stance . // Platooning . Pinch-hitting . Late-inning relievers . Switch hitters . The player who can be said to set baseball 's endless lefty-righty machinations in motion is the left-handed batter , known familiarly as BL . He benefits from the fact that the majority of pitchers are righthanders ; their natural curve deliveries come in to him but tail away from right-handed batters . He also has that step and a half head start to first base . The fact that many of the old ball parks had cozy right-field walls enhanced the careers of Ruth , Speaker and Gehrig , all left-handed . And that explains why many left-handed batters  --  Cobb was one  --  are not true southpaws at all , but natural righties whose dads simply loved them enough to make them BL . // Baseball 's true lefthanders , the ones deserving of the designation southpaw , are those who throw lefty , pitchers in particular . The southpaw pitcher benefits from unorthodoxy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the first-base dugout , he is especially effective against those dreaded left-handed batters . His ability to " neutralize " BL makes a good left-handed pitcher found gold . // The left-handed pitcher 's unorthodoxy also makes him the subject of slurs and slander . Southpaws , it is claimed , are congenitally unable to throw overhand but are given instead to sneaky sidearm deliveries . They are said to be " cute " and " cunning " and endowed with a lot of " stuff . " The legendary John McGraw purportedly cracked that if you split open a southpaw 's head , all that would fall out would be bases on balls . // While pitchers clearly get most of the unflattering attention , there is also room for miscellaneous lefthanders like Outfielder Babe Herman , who caught fly balls with his head , doubled into a double play , etc . And there is a certain undeniable thoroughness in the fact that baseball effectively bans lefthanders from no fewer than four positions , accepting as gospel that they are simply unequipped to play them . // In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the anti-lefty arguments vary suspiciously , but the chief one seems to be that the southpaw 's throw to second would be impeded when right-handed batters are at the plate  --  and , well , are n't the majority of batters right-handed ? Yet it would logically follow that a left-handed catcher might come in handy now and then when a left-handed batter is up . One might as well forget it . A left-handed catcher named Jack Clements logged 17 years in the majors in the late 19th century , but there has been none since 1958 , when Dale Long inconclusively worked two games behind the plate for the Chicago Cubs . // The other proscribed positions are second base , third base and shortstop , leaving first the only spot in the infield where sinistrals are welcome . The chief argument is that lefthanders have to pivot the wrong way to make the throw to first . Yet lefthanders Willie Keeler and George Sisler played some games at third base on their way to the Hall of Fame at Cooperstown . Ex-big-league First Baseman Frank Torre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in St. Louis , firmly believes that lefthanders can handle that position , too . // Could it be that southpaws really are daffy ? And that they are better athletes ? There is a limit to what researchers in laterality , the field of hand preference , really know about their subject . They are sure that handedness has something to do with heredity . And they know that sinistrals and dextrals do have certain more or less significant differences . // These mostly involve cerebral organization . In what amounts to cross wiring , the right side of the body is usually controlled by the brain 's left hemisphere , which handles verbal tasks like speech and writing . The body 's left side is generally governed by the right hemisphere , which is endowed with power of visual and spatial perception . One would think , and some of the researchers do , that the resulting tendency would be for righthanders to be analytical and practical and for southpaws to be free-spirited , creative and illogical . // But difficulties arise when you start carrying any of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lefthanders are more given to alcoholism , suicide , dyslexia and the rest . Curtis Hardyck , professor of educational psychology at the University of California , has plowed through more than 200 such studies and found a tendency toward bias and inadequate sampling . " Most of the evidence just does n't stand up , " Hardyck says . " There 's a tendency to overinterpret results , a feeling that lefthanders , because they 're different from the majority , are somehow wrong . The fact that da Vinci and Benjamin Franklin were left-handed ... is overlooked . " // The same thing happens in sport , whose cherished stereotypes necessarily ignore as inconvenient the bland lefthanders like Stan Musial , Sandy Koufax and Rod Laver  --  or eccentric righties like Jimmy Piersall , Mark Fidrych and Ilie Nastase . We may chuckle at the fact that newly acquired Montreal southpaw Will McEnaney sometimes walked an imaginary dog outside the clubhouse when he was with Indianapolis . But what about the reaction of his manager , Vern Rapp , recently hired to pilot the St. Louis Cardinals ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned dog inside . " Rapp is right-handed. // Much of the left-handed lore surely is nurtured by the southpaws themselves . Few of them have ever been more genuinely zany than onetime Yankee Pitcher Lefty ( Vernon ) Gomez , who was nicknamed Goofy after making known his intentions of constructing a " fish saver , " a revolving goldfish bowl that would spare occupants the need to swim . But the shrewd Gomez was also a box office attraction , and he goes on cultivating his role as a fun-loving southpaw even today . Now a popular after-dinner speaker , he delights in regaling audiences with stories of how his high-spirited Chihuahua , Taco , is a lefty , too . How does he know ? Deadpans Gomez , " When he goes to the fireplug , he raises his left leg . " // There are other reasons for quirkiness among left-handed pitchers . Because they are in demand , lefties often get away with things that might get righthanders in hot water , and this includes wildness both on the mound and off . St. Louis Cardinal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect that he would never have been offered a contract if he were a righthander . " But I was a lefty so they took a chance , " he says . Of his own deportment , which includes stomping around on the mound and casting baleful glances toward home plate , Hrabosky says , " I want the batter to think I 'm crazy . I want him to know I 'm crazy . " // The fact that athletes are somewhat freer these days to ply their craft as southpaws no doubt accounts for much of the new lefty surge in sport . // " There is reason to believe that lefthanders are better athletes , " says University of Pennsylvania psychology professor Ruben Gur , who specializes in laterality . " Left-handedness can result in different ways . In some lefthanders , the spatial functioning appears to dominate , giving them better spatial perception and perhaps quicker reflexes . Lefthanders as a group also tend to be more ambidextrous . In part it 's because their brain organization tends to be more bilateral than righthanders ' . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lefthander in society is forced to use both hands . " // And now consider how lefthanders have persisted on the Professional Bowlers Association tour , which woke up a few years ago and discovered that some 30% of its leading prize winners were southpaws . There was good reason for it . When PBA officials arrived at a tournament site , they determined that the right side of each lane , having received more of the action , was often worn and rutted , causing difficulties for the right-handed pros . Bowling on smoother surfaces  --  finding their " grooves " easier  --  southpaws flourished . Amid threats of a boycott by righthanders , an alarmed PBA got out the lacquer and oil and began doing a better job of " equalizing " conditions . A lot of southpaws began disappearing , but not all . Today lefthanders still make up 14% of the top bowlers , and one of them . Earl Anthony , in 1975 became the first bowler to win $100,000 . It was his third straight year as the PBA 's No. 1 prize winner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He says , " Conditions on the tour used to be unfair to righthanders . We lefthanders could stand and bowl from the same place while righthanders always had to move around to change the speeds and angles on the ball . When the PBA decided to act , I was able to cope . I always studied righthanders and I adjusted . Bowling is a game of adjustment and that 's easier for lefthanders anyway . Heck , in life that 's all we do . " // The winners of the Lefty-Righty championship in Myrtle Beach were Duane Streets , an insuranceman , and Morris Masten , a schoolteacher , both from Indianapolis . They shot a best-ball score of 277 to whip 90 other teams in the 72-hole competition . Streets was the lefthander . Masten was the other one .
