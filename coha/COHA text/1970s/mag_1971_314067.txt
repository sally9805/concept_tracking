A telling anomaly of the 1967 Middle East war is that Israel , in spite of capturing vast stretches of Arab territory , actually ended up with a border 68 miles shorter than before the fighting . Reason : the present de facto lines are straighter . They are also much easier for Israel to defend . In any peace negotiation , therefore , a crucial question will be how much of this occupied territory Israel will be willing to relinquish and how much it will insist on retaining to preserve border security . TIME Jerusalem Bureau Chief Marsh Clark made a threeday , 465-mile tour along Israel 's eastern boundaries . He discovered " a frenzy of construction and settlement activity , " which suggests that Israel is not about to surrender its occupied territory . His report : <P> My companion on the trip , an Israeli reserve officer , started by placing a 9-mm. pistol on the ledge under the dash of our Ford Cortina . His gesture seemed symbolic of the atmosphere along much of the border . We began at Mount Hermon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lebanon and Syria . There we spotted the first of the yellow bulldozers that are everywhere in the occupied territories , scraping and pushing , widening and straightening , lifting boulers or rearranging sand . It is said that Israel has more bulldozers per capita than any other nation ; I can believe it . <P> Beneath Mount Hermon , dozers are shaping a road along which Israeli patrols can roll . The patrols keep an eye on " Fatahland , " the corner of Lebanon from which the Arab guerrillas have launched destructive attacks on Israel . <P> From Mount Hermon , the border road winds down the Golan Heights . Until 1967 , Syrian troops used the heights as an artillery platform against kibbutzim in the northern Galilee valley below . Now the heights are largely deserted . Kuneitra , which once had a population of 20,000. has only 300 today , most of them members of an Israeli kibbutz that operates a coffee shop selling apple strudel , beverages , and busts of Golda Meir . Moshe Dayan and David Ben-Gurion . Smaller Syrian villages are being bulldozed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains an Israeli officer . " They provided refuge for stray dogs , cats and fedayeen . " Some Golan fields still carry red-triangle signs denoting Syrian minefields . Others are lush with wheat and cotton grown by Israeli kibbutzniks who ride in tractors with armor plating on the side . <P> Dead Sea Life . The rolling Jordanian border south of the heights is still Israel 's most vulnerable . For that reason , the government has established there a necklace of nahals. fortified camps manned by young Israelis who are equally able to farm or to fight . But where the Dead Sea provides natural protection , Israel is developing tourist attractions . In the vicinity of Masada , the legendary fortress of ancient Hebrew history , there are now three hotels with 228 rooms as well as two guest houses and three youth hostels . Another hotel , the Pan American Dead Sea ( no kin to the airline ) , will be finished in 30 months at a cost of $5 million . The Pan American will have 181 rooms and an indoor pool fed by therapeutic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth .
