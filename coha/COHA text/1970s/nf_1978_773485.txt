txt 100 Wild , Wild Woman many ways . One reward is simply the accomplishment of it all ? did my body actually manage to do that ? ( Although it 's not a good idea to go off on a strenuous backpack trip from ground zero as far as muscle tone and lung power are concerned , you do n't have to be Hercules to manage , either . I 'm no teenager , and worse , I 'm a cigarette smoker who lives at sea level and had not been exercising very faithfully when I went to California to go packing in the mountains . But with just a week of greatly reduced smoking and greatly increased muscle building in the pool of my parents ' San Diego apartment , I was remarkably toned up , especially in the all-important heart , lungs , and shoulder and upper back muscles , which a couple of hours of swimming a day can really work out . ) But important as the psychic side of the physical accomplishments of backpacking can be , an even better benefit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you consequently can eat without guilt . I admit to being a fairly accomplished glutton . I also admit to a tendency toward overweight . Now and then I put up a good show of dieting and doing situps , but such noble moments never last very long ; in fact , some days , they never get past lunch . So I was especially thrilled to discover that a pre- and postbackpack-trip lunch of hamburger , french fries , and chocolate shake with whipped cream , plus lots of chocolate snacks on the trail , in addition to hot cocoa and several starchy , reasonably hearty meals , had not added a single ounce to my weight . When I first got back to a house with a scale , the news did n't look so good ? I had gained four pounds , according to initial reports . But that turned out to be liquids retained by all the salt tablets and salty food and drink I had taken in , and after forty-five trips to the indoor bathroom , I had actually lost four pounds ! What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but a net loss to show for it . Diet doctors would definitely not approve of such a regime , however , and indeed , the weight all came back in short order . But it was fun while it lasted , and one physical benefit that did stick around longer was the muscle tone ? first from the prehike swimming , and then from the hiking itself , which blessedly did most of its good work on the hips . Besides being a fine way to get close to nature , backpacking is a kind of poor girl 's health club , only a lot less tiresome , and a lot more fun . Like everything else about backpacking today , food for wilderness Camping 101 travel has become light , easy , and highly ingenious . In fact , the only troublesome thing about carrying enough food for an active , hungry body is the expense , since the miracle of freeze-dried meals does not come cheaply . Nevertheless , these wonder foods provide a reasonably tasty ( that is an average rating ? some are very tasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , and for that alone they are worth their price . Many brands and types of meals are available , including whole breakfasts , vegetables such as green beans or peas compressed into a round disk that expands into a potful of something quite like the original when put in water ; meats such as pork chops and chopped sirloin ; casserole-type dishes ; fruit ; and even something called " ice cream . " Most sporting-goods stores and mountain shops carry a wide range of these products , and they are also sold through most outdoor-equipment catalogs . On my trip to the San Jacinto Mountains , where the temperature dropped to near freezing at night , we dined on Mountain House concoctions , which are packed in a heavy plastic pouch that acts as its own cooking pot . All you do is pour a cup or so of hot water into the bag , let it sit , and presto ! macaroni and cheese ( good cheese , weird pasta ) , chicken stew ( not bad ) , and shrimp creole ( a culinary triumph , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plastic pouch ) . Each meal was just about big enough for two , especially if followed by granola bars and hot chocolate , and we just spooned it out of the bag and into our mouths . What this lacked in elegance was more than made up for in convenience , since there were only two spoons and two cups to wash . Economy-minded backpackers who do n't mind a little extra work can fix up their own combinations from the various packaged foods and instant soups on supermarket shelves . Other easy , energy-giving foods include Carnation Breakfast Bars and Instant Breakfast , granola bars , dried banana chips ( a backpacker 's food ) , and " gorp , " a hiker 's concoction made of nuts , M &M; chocolates , raisins , sunflower seeds , and any other light , quick-energy goodie the maker happens to feel like throwing in .

But there 's one thing you must have , and that 's water . Before striking off for some unknown distance , it 's important to learn whether there is water , and how safe it is to drink . Even in the remotest places , water may be contaminated , especially if lots of animals hang out around the waterhole , or great numbers of campers have been passing through . A spring bubbling up from a rock could probably be considered safe , and a swift stream or waterfall running over rocks deep in the wild country probably could too . But if something died in the water a ways upstream , the cleanest-looking rivulet could be contaminated . So to avoid possible trouble , and in all cases where you are advised that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The surest way to purify water is to boil it for at least ten minutes ( since boiled water tastes flat , it should be poured from one container to another to re-aerate it ) . But this takes a lot of fuel and a lot of time . Other methods of purification include Halzone tablets , chlorine bleach , and iodine tablets such as Potable Aqua . The latter works best , and has no bad taste . This is the method many wilderness travelers seem to prefer . On a hot day or , for that matter , on any day involving strenuous exercise - - it 's a good idea to mix a packet of a sports drink such as powdered Gatorade into your water bottle , not so much for the flavor as for the mineral salts it contains . Lots of people make faces at the mention of Gatorade , remembering the peculiar , swampwater taste of the early bottled product , hut now there is a pleasant orangeflavored powder packaged in foil , like instant lemonade , but much more useful since it replaces things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's amazing how much restorative power there is in a great slug of water and mineral salts with an orange taste . The same is true of salt tablets ( except for people who ca n't tolerate them ) . Loss of salt through perspiration can cause muscle cramps as well as heat illness , so at the first sign of weakness , tiredness , or pain in the muscles , it 's a good idea to swallow a salt pill . Try not to wait till a major cramp knocks you to the ground , though ? prevention , not perseverance , should be everyone 's slogan on the trail . The same sort of preventive measure should be taken where Camping 103 temperature is concerned . If you start getting too hot , stop and rest , drink some liquids , take off the pack , and let the sweat evaporate . If you begin to feel cold , or even just think you might get cold , put on some warm clothing . Do n't wait till you start to shiver . It 's easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but once you get chilled , it can take a long time to get the temperature up again . In the San Jacinto Mountains in July , the air drops from pleasantly warm to around 35 degrees when night falls ? and it cools off rapidly . I had a down vest , a wool shirt , a down jacket , and a hooded windbreaker with me , which worked perfectly when added a piece at a time as the first signs of coming discomfort appeared . The first night , however , I sat around pretending more comfort than I felt , and by the time I started covering up , it was too late for an easy transition . I had to put on every available warm garment at once , and it still took about half an hour and a couple of hot chocolates to stop the shivers . Of course , I am a particularly foolish case when it comes to recognizing my own comfort index . As a kid I would stay submerged in Lake Michigan till my lips turned blue and I had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sat near an open window in my own New York apartment till 1 got so cold it took three blankets and a heating pad to get me warm again . Heat and cold are not the only potential dangers to beware of in the wilds . Since backpacking not only frees you from the tensions of the regular world , but from the safety factors too , there are a number of precautions that must be taken . No one should set off on a wilderness trail without taking a lot of knowledge along , either in the form of an experienced friend or two , or home study from one or more of the comprehensive books for backpackers . Foremost on the must-reading list is Colin Fletcher 's The New Complete Walker , the backpacker 's bible , an entertaining as well as highly informative book . Another basic book for packers is Backpacking One Step at a Time , by Harvey Manning . And another good book , with special conservation recommendations , is Paul Petzoldt 's Wilderness Handbook . Since you are so alone when you cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that special trail , it 's vital that you go with care ? and everything you 'll need to keep from getting hungry , cold , thirsty , or lost . Although there are potential dangers far horn the phone lines and roads , there are special pleasures , too . For one thing , it 's very 104 Wild , Wild Woman beautiful , and very quiet . For another , you have an unusual freedom of choice ; since there is literally nothing to do , in the town and city sense of the word , you can do nothing without the slightest sense of guilt . You can day hike or photograph flowers ; you can fish in mountain streams ; you can enjoy the odd pleasure of breathing untainted air ; or you can simply sit and talk . You can also just keep packing , setting up a different camp each night and moving on by day . Generally , backpackers ' freedom includes the opportunity to decide when and where to set up camp . Of course , the woods are not quite as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are hitting the trails to allow totally unregulated traffic in most places anymore . At present , wilderness permits are required for most governmentprotected areas , and in many cases the rangers will prescribe the area you must camp in . But except in the most heavily used places ? the Appalachian Trail , for instance , or some of the wilderness areas in the Northeast , the backcountry in some national parks , and certain popular areas in the Sierras ? there is still plenty of room to roam even within an assigned area . Since this leaves the choice of a campsite up to you , some basic safety rules must be observed . The same may be true in an established campground , though generally these sites are laid out with safety as well as comfort in mind . In the wilderness , however , it 's entirely up to you . Before you lay yourself down to sleep , make sure you have n't picked a spot where you might die before you wake . There 's no great trick to this : just remember to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this is where dead trees and , in winter , great gobs of heavy wet snow can be knocked down onto an innocent little tent below by a strong night wind . Such often overlooked dangers are referred to as widowmakers ? a hangover from the days when most back-country campers were thought to be men . The other danger to watch for in campsite selection is arroyo beds , streambeds that are presently dry but susceptible to becoming flooded and very dangerous if a heavy rainstorm should send a lot of runoff into their channels . Not so dangerous , but potentially uncomfortable , is a rainwater drainage area ? a pattern that can easily be recognized on the bare ground . Also , for comfort 's sake , check the wind before making camp in a canyon . If it 's blowing up canyon by day , there may be a cold wind coming down after dark . Camping 105 And wherever you set up camp , make sure it is n't on a piece of slanted ground . This should be obvious , but night after night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head pointing downhill . What you want is a nice , flat piece of ground away from water and out of the grass , where bugs abound . Clear off all the little pebbles and sticks and thorns and other objects that can poke through your foam mattress pad and disturb your sleep . You 'll never get them all , but the more you get , the better you 'll feel . Camping is fun , no matter where you do it . It 's not like being at home , which is at least half of its charm . It involves some inconveniences , and some discomforts , but they are an easy enough trade for the wonderful escape that camping allows . If possible , however , a person 's very first camping trip should be arranged to coincide with beautiful weather . Let there be sunny days that soften into star-studded , pine-scented nights , that open into pearly , rose-tinted dawns , that bloom into sunny , blue-sky mornings , and so on . Let there be sparkling water to swim in , and soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunset worthy of tears , and a night of crickets , with a touch of mystery . But above all , let there be no rain . My first campout took place on an island in Wisconsin where each year the girls of Camp Winnetaska canoed through a chain of lakes and set up camp for two nights and a full day . That first time the weather was as perfect as summer weather could possibly be . The lake was dazzling , and we swam in its crystal waters , cooling off after our long paddle . The evening was glorious , full of color and the heady smell of pine . We roasted hot dogs and sang around a cheerful fire , cozy even in our camp-suit shorts . All night we slept soundly in our poncho-andblanket rolls with mosquito-netting head tents held up by sticks , oblivious to the downhill cant of our heads and the many rocks , tree roots , and pine cones that had miraculously appeared under our beds as soon as we squirmed our way in . ( Had n't we carefully checked our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free of even the tiniest pebble ? ) The next day , arising to the freshest of mornings , we ate our hearty breakfast of Kool-aid and apple-butter sandwiches , and set up for the great turkey roast that consumed the rest of the day . Working in teams , we turned the bird on its peeled-sapling spit ( peeling saplings in wilderness areas is frowned on today , but we owned the island , and 106 Wild , Wild Woman we did it only once a year ) , daubed it with butter , gathered firewood , and fed the fire . We also froliced in the water , and toward evening , we ate the marvelously crisp and juicy turkey , so unfamiliar out of holiday season , and so much tastier than anything cooked indoors . After another glorious night under a clear and pine-fragrant sky , we canoed home to camp , singing lustily as we crossed the sparkling blue Wisconsin waters . It was an experience never to be forgotten , an adventure to anticipate , again and again , year after year . Unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winnetaska canoe trip that I took . For four more years , I paddled with the rest of the campers to the magic island , but each year , as soon as we had squirmed our bodies into our flimsy beds , great banks of clouds would come rolling across the starlit skies , the pines would begin a doleful moaning and toss violently about , like waves . Then , with a howl of wind , a flash of lightning , and a crack of thunder , the rains would descend Not just a mist of rain or a sprinkle , but a deluge , a solid mass of water turning the ground to mud and our blanket rolls to soggy jokes . The rest of the night had to be spent in a large canvas tent , where thirty or so of us sat steaming in the breathless air , giving off strange , wet-little-girl smells , and getting very little sleep . The next day the turkey roast went off as usual , except with all the rain it was difficult to create a fire hot enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fowl half raw , half smoked , and only very slightly warm . And later we sat up another night in the steamy , smelly tent . All this might have discouraged me , or at least dampened my enthusiasm for camping by canoe . But each year I could hardly wait for canoe-trip time to come around again . Although the weather was unfailingly bad , that one memory of a perfect set of days in camp tempered all other experience . Even the rain seemed filtered through a veil of sun . In fact , the sun never shone again on a Camp Winnetaska canoe trip during my time , but though I can now look back on the wet years and laugh at t he awfulness of it all , in my heart it was always bright and sparkling , with a star-encrusted sky , gently swaying pines , and a turkey that tasted unbelievably good .

The Magic of Walking , by AARON SUSSMAN AND RUTH GOODE . With the tremendous growth in the popularity of backpacking , hiking has undergone a kind of merger , losing some of its special identity and ending up as a mere part , albeit an essential one , of the larger sport of wilderness camping . In a way , this is unfair . True , backpacking increases the pleasure of hiking , since it allows you to stay wherever you 've hiked to instead of turning right around and going home . It also permits you to keep right on hiking for weeks at a time , if you 're so inclined . But though backpacking could not take place without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a wonderful sport that can be enjoyed in a number of ways for all kinds of reasons without even much commitment in the way of energy or time . Certainly it can he indulged in without a heavy burden on the back . Unfortunately , " hiking " does n't have quite the noble ring to it that " backpacking " does . It sounds a hit too much like walking , and walking has fallen into low esteem in our machine-dependent age . Going places on foot has become sufficiently unusual that when President Carter walked from the Capitol to the White House on his Inaugural Day , it was considered front-page news . Our preference for cars is nothing new . I remember hearing people speculate when I was a child that by some far-off time like the year 2000 we 'd all be driving around so much that babies would be born without legs . I do n't suppose anyone , with the possible exception of National Enquirer devotees , really believed that , but even so , there 's something compelling about the theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their little feet , as soon as they also learn to operate something that moves by mechanical means , they seem happy to trade in their walkers for a set of wheels . 108 Hiking 109 Not everyone has become semiattached to a machine . People in cities still walk to the corner store for the paper , partly because there is still a corner store to go to , and partly because they could n't park if they drove . But an alarming number of suburban and country dwellers and even city folks seem to consider any distance over a hundred yards too far to travel by foot . I 've been with people who drove to a party no further away than the end of the block . And I 've watched people wait impatiently for someone to come home with the car so they could drive a quarter mile for a loaf of bread . As for walking a mile ? forget it ! Once I walked from one New Jersey suburb to another and asked a policeman along the way if I was headed in the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there would n't be a bus along for an hour . When I told him I was n't looking for a bus , he shook his head as if I were a simpleton and said , " But it 's much too far to walk ! " As it happened , the place I was going was just under a mile ? the distance that runners now regularly cover in less than four minutes , and even lazy walkers can cover in half an hour . But for people who would drive to a party down the block ( or , to use the ultimate symbol of auto dependence pictured in a Buster Keaton movie called " The Navigator , " make a U-turn to visit the house across the street ) , a mile probably is an impossible distance away . I do n't blame people for being attached to machines . In most of the country , including cities , cars are almost impossible to live without . Corner stores are giving up in favor of seven-acre shopping plazas located in what used to be farmland or woodlot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the U.S. , if you do n't drive to work , you do n't get to work . Besides , cars can get you to wonderful places in minutes or hours instead of the days it took before internal combustion came along , making the great outdoors a lot more accessible . For many reasons , it 's so easy to become used to going by car that going by foot begins to seem unusual , even eccentric , even against the law . Unfortunately , just plain walking actually has become sufficiently rare as we approach the mythical year 2000 that in some municipalities it really is illegal to be on foot unless you can prove the innocence of your carless state . Foot travelers arc assumed to he vagrants or thieves , up to no good . Several years ago as Iamiliar and upright a personage as Justice William O. Douglas and a party of 110 Wild , Wild Woman walkers he was leading on a hike were refused service in a restaurant because they had arrived on foot . A walker wearing a backpack may present a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a walker who is simply walking ? well , something must be afoot ! It was n't always this way . Walking used to be the most respectable of activities . The literati of the nineteenth century were fond of walking , with foot tours of Scotland , the English Lake Country , Switzerland , northern Italy , or anywhere that took their fancy a popular pastime . Keats , Shelley , Mary Wollstonecraft ( who married Shelley and later wrote Frankenstein ) , Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy , plus many other notable authors , nonauthors , and assorted pantheists of the day enjoyed these country tours , walking from inn to inn . As they walked , they saw , breathed , heard , and smelled the land in a way impossible by any other means . The closest we can come today to this footloose approach to travel is backpacking , since it 's doubtful that a hiker could get a room in a modern motel , much less enjoy the smells and sounds of modern roads . Not only do we tend to associate walking with strangeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease , wherein participants are paid so much by sponsors for every mile they manage to trudge , but our highway-and-byway builders have made walking next to impossible . Except in areas where walkers ( or more commonly , bikers ) are included in roadside plans , there often is n't enough room along the pavement for a person to go safely by foot . Despite the fact that hiking is no longer the life-of-the-open-road kind of thing it was in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , it still can be a very satisfying activity in its own right . According to my basic definition of an outdoor sport , hiking is virtually archetypal . It requires no teams or partners ( although a stroll through a misty meadow or a green-budding woods with a suitable companion can certainly double the fun ) . It calls for no special equipment , no reservations , no weeks-in-advance plans . All it needs is a decent , comfortable pair of boots or shoes and a good stretch of outdoors with something in the way of nature clinging to its sides . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do , not only because they are pretty well stripped of nature , but because they force a stop-and-start rhythm not set by you , which is tiring and not sporting at all ) . It can be a country road , or even a suburban road , though here there 's often too little walking room , too many houses , unleashed dogs , fast // drivers , and incredulous policemen around to permit a decent hike . For hiking in its highest , purest form , however , you need a trail , preferably one that winds through some wild-looking place , deep in a forest , perhaps , or on a mountain ; maybe bordering a stream that leads to a gorge with a waterfall , or breaking out of thick Hansel-andGretel forest onto a sun-drenched meadow . And if all that is not available , just a pretty place with trees , and grass , and quiet will do as well . Such walking room is n't as hard to find as you might imagine . Despite rumors that America is all agribusiness and megalopolis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't have to go all the way to the Rockies or the Bureau of Land Management lands of the West to lose yourself ( not literally , I hope ) in an unmechanized world . Almost every rural area has its share of old dirt roads , many of them leading to abandoned orchards and farms where no one lives anymore , places slowly being reclaimed by untamed nature , but still rich with the fading memory of unknown people 's lives . Even in areas where life and commerce continue to hum along , there are all kinds of possibilities . Many towns have local preserves , arboretums , or nature centers , often equipped with enjoyable , wildlike trails ; and lots of municipal parks are surprisingly rustic . One of the most famous such areas , Central Park in New York City , has preserved an amazing amount of open space for the urban population ? the park is actually bigger , on a square-foot basis , than the entire country of Monaco . Those who dare to wander freely there have some beautiful wild and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best spots for bird watching in the whole Northeast a fact that has not escaped the city 's feral cat population , which seems to be thriving inside a large fenced-off area marked " Keep Out Bird Sanctuary . " The park also has a large lake where outdoor people in general can indulge in various fantasies . I once saw a gold - partner , a six-vessel naval battle , and a boatload of fishermen trolling hotdogs , all on the same afternoon . Other huge ( much bigger than Monaco ) and well-endowed urban nature centers include Balboa Park in San Diego ; Golden Gate Park in San Francisco ; Rock Creek Park in Washington , I ) . C. ; Griffith Park in Los Angeles ; Forest Park in St. Louis , Lincoln Park in Chicago ; and Washington Park in Cleveland . But the acreage does n't have to be vast to provide quality recreational hiking . Almost every 112 Wild , Wild Woman town of any size has a park with tree-lined paths , good for spur-ofthe-moment leg stretching , and if you squint a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another good source of neighborhood nature for many people are reservoir and watershed land holdings ( although you may have to get a permit from the city or state water-resource authority to walk on this land ) , and those who live near beach or river front that has not been closed to public access can consider themselves in hiker 's paradise , as far as I 'm concerned . Moving into the big-league trails , a number of states have game lands purchased with hunting-license fees , which are open to everyone , providing good hiking year-round ( during hunting season , wear a piece of blaze-orange clothing in the woods , as hunters do by law in many states ) . Trails are also maintained in state forests , forest preserves , and parks . And , of course , the Federal government presides over some of the greatest hiking country in the world in its forests , parks , wildlife refuges , and recreation areas . The possibilities here are limitless , especially in the national forests , which according to a report made in the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hiking , of course , goes very well with tent or recreational-vehicle camping , especially in some of the more spectacular national parks , where car traffic has become such a nuisance that it 's being severely curtailed in some areas . For noncampers , there are all kinds of comfortable resorts and lodges in state and national parks and on private lands , with good hiking trails a feature of their entertainment package . When I was a child , my parents took me for short spring vacations to Starved Rock in Illinois , a marvelous place named after a huge , steep-sided , mesalike rock on the Illinois River where a group of Indians was once isolated and starved to oblivion by a rival tribe . Modern visitors are more comfortably accommodated in a beautiful lodge and outlying cabins , and there are miles of beautiful countryside surrounding this place . On our trips , the parents present tended to stay indoors , admiring the view through the windows and playing bridge , while the assembled offspring explored the network of trails and climbed the steep rock by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something-for-everyone place , and there are many more like it throughout the country . One reason we have as many really good back-woods trails in as // many areas as we do is that , despite the decline in the popularity of walking among the general population , there are still tremendous numbers of people to whom hiking is a way of life . These people not only hike the trails , but they help make them , repair them , mark them , watch over them , and keep records on where they are . Without the members of hiking clubs in the U.S. , the state of this ancient activity ? to say nothing of our potentially endangered legs ? might be in serious jeopardy . Hiking clubs and their members deserve the thanks of everyone who has ever hit a trail , or ever hopes to . But the clubs do more than drudge away at trail maintenance . They also have fun ? and they help other people learn the pleasures of hiking .

For information on trails in your area , contact the National Forest Service ( if you have any national forests around ) ; the state departments of fish and game , parks , and tourism or commerce ; and check the local chamber of commerce . In addition to these sources , there are countless books on hiking that give trail information for various localities ; try your friendly neighborhood bookstore or **25;153;TOOLONG store to see what 's on hand . Three excellent regional guides that give a lot of good advice on what and how , as well as where , are Hiking Trails in the Midwest and Hiking Trails in the Southern Mountains , by Glenda Daniel and Jerry Sullivan ; and Hiking Trails in the Mid-Atlantic States , by Edward Garvey , all published by the Greatlakes Living Press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail information is the Sierra Club , which has a number of comprehensive Totehooks ( the club 's patented name for its soft-cover take-along hiking and backpacking guides ) telling all about many places , West and Fast . One of the country 's most famous trails is the Appalachian I rail , a 2,000-mile-long footway running from northern Maine to southern Georgia . Known for its beauty and historic interest , this trail has become something of a goal for the ambitious to dream of one day taking on . Despite ( or because of ) its length , several people have walked the 114 Wild , Wild Woman Appalachian Trail from one end to the other . One of these was Grandma Gatewood , who hiked the two thousand miles first at age sixty-five , repeating the feat at sixty-seven , and finally making a third full-length journey at seventy-some-odd . Like this extraordinary woman , who certainly demonstrated that hiking is a sport for all ages and sexes , the people who have walked the trail from beginning to end are hikers in the profoundest sense . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sleep along the trail . This is unavoidable ; you can not walk so many miles without eating and sleeping , and though there are towns adjacent to the trail , it would n't be possible to stop at one each night . Thus a backpack ( or , as with Grandma Gatewood , a denim bag ) makes the long march possible . Another person who backpacks so he will be able to walk is Colin Fletcher , author of the backpacker 's bible . Although he has developed the art of living off his back to a high degree , walking , not camping , is the main point of it all . He has gone the length of the West Coast from the Canadian border down to Mexico on foot , and has walked through the Grand Canyon on what he called a trip through time . Even the title of his most famous book , The New Complete Walker , expresses his priorities . Here is one who believes in the glory of feet .

Day hiking is an excellent way to get acquainted with the outdoors , or to dip into it in the midst of a busy schedule . A friend of mine who has to drive a lot on her job often stops the car if she sees a park or trail ahead and walks a way with her dog , who always travels with her . Another friend wooed and won his wife with hikes and champagne lunches in an autumn woods . Short hikes also make a perfect family activity , offering a chance for parents and children to escape the hypnotism of TV and the competitiveness of many games and sports . Some of the best times I had as a kid were the afternoons after school when my mother took me on nature walks through a local forest preserve .

Hikes have many benefits besides the chance to get closer to family or friends . They 're an easy and excellent form of exercise , firming up muscles and trimming flab . They 're also quiet and restful to the mind . People who live on wheels tend to miss out on things . While camping at the Land Between the Lakes , I once watched a prepubescent boy and girl spend an entire day going up and down the camping area roadway on minibikes , those scaled-down motorcycles that apparently can go a hundred miles on a tank of gas .

At one point the riders came to a halt to refuel on cookies and Cokes , and my husband asked them if they ever went for a walk . They threw him a killer look that would have been at home in the movie " Village of the Damned , " and curled their mouths in total disgust at such backward thinking . But with the possible exception of these gas-driven children , it 's never too late for a machine-age victim to get back on his or her feet . The trails , paths , and back-country roads are out there waiting . All a non-walker needs to do is start taking steps . One note of warning should be heeded by expert and beginner alike : on any hike that will take you into the wilds , cut off from shelter and the various umbilicals of civilization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect to begone no more than a few hours , you should tell some responsible person where you 're going and when you think you 'll return ; and when you set off , you should take a little more than the shirt on your back . Unlikely as it might seem on a hot , brilliant June morning , bad things can happen on a trail . Sudden storms can break and catch you far from home . Y ou can get lost . You can get hurt . A hike can take longer than you 'd planned , leaving you cold , hungry , thirsty , or caught out in the dark , To be on the safe side , then , take along a small survival kit . Include 116 Wild , Wild Woman a wool shirt or sweater and light rain gear ( even on a hot summer day rain can badly chill unprotected skin and put you in danger of serious illness ) . Some hikers carry a space blanket as a just-in-case shelter or ground cloth to sit on during breaks . The daypack should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sandwich for lunch , and some extras for just in case , such as granola bars , the nut-raisin-M &M; mixture known as " gorp , " chocolate bars , and the like ) , a bottle of water , water-purification tablets , salt tablets if it 's very hot , an Ace bandage for potential muscle strains , bandages and moleskins for potential blisters , matches in a waterproof case , a small flashlight for emergencies , and a compass and map . You wo n't need to carry money back into the woods , but take a few dimes along anyway ; you might have to make a phone call if something goes wrong . Even if you 're just going to amble along a country road , or walk a mile or so from the car to go fishing , you 'd be wise to go equipped with this basic comfort-and-survival kit . And if you 're going into higher altitudes , particularly in an area where the weather is unpredictable , do n't fail to take these self-protectors along . Too many people have perished on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oregon or some seemingly benign place on a fine day , only to be caught by a sudden rain or a high wind with nothing to help them survive . Just as improvident are people who stroll out into the desert with no water , no sun protection , and no idea of where they are . You may feel silly preparing for a mini-siege when you know you 're going to be gone only half a day , but suppose that four hours stretched to eight , or twelve , or twenty-four ? There are many comfortable daypacks on the market that can easily hold all you 'll need to weather an emergency , and you can carry the whole works on your back with no strain . With luck , you 'll never need anything but the sandwich and the water and the candy inside . But why take chances to save a pound or two ? One of the pleasures of hiking , or walking , is that it may be the one activity the human body is best designed to do . Sitting and even lying down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our daily footwork involves back-and-forth housekeeping , aimless window shopping , slow strolling , or simply standing still ? all motions ( or lack of them ) that can be quite fatiguing . Walking the Hiking 117 thing you do when you move one foot briskly in front of the other , arms swinging freely , wind in your hair , song on your lips , good boots on your feet ? is not . Furthermore , a good walk will do more to revive the spirits and relieve tiredness ( since many tired feelings come from muscular and nervous strain ) than a nap in the afternoon . And though a good walk wo n't knock off a lot of calories ( you burn about 75 per mile ) , given a choice between a cookie break and a half-hour walk , you know where you 'll come out ahead . " Thousands of tired , nerve-shaken , over-civilized people are beginning to find out that going to the mountains is going home ; that wildness is necessity ; and that mountain parks and reservations are useful not only as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life . " - JOHN MUIR , 1898 . For millions of ordinary nine-to-five , two-weeks-with-pay folks , " getting away from it all " means nothing more drastic than a trip to Disneyland or maybe a tour of Spain . But to an increasing number of people , weighted down with worries about high prices , low mileage , fuel crises , food shortages , politicians , traffic jams , bad air , and summer reruns on TV , the idea of real escape is becoming more and more attractive . They imagine trading roads , telephones , factories , Burger Kings , and the evening news for a week or so of crystal waters , natural sounds , wine-sharp air , carpets of flowers , and roofs of leaves . Ah , wilderness . . . now that is getting away ! It 's a dream that millions of backpackers are realizing every day . But what about those other millions who are n't quite ready , physically or mentally , to trade the abstract burdens of modern life for the all-too-tangible burden of a pack on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trip to a place that nature made ? One good way is a river-float trip , the original form of rapid transit , full of the same capricious pace changes that mark the course of travel through man-made canyons , but with none of the rush , crush , dirt , or frustration . None of the time schedules , either , or the sense of destination . On a river , you are n't traveling to get somewhere ; you 're just traveling . Things come to meet you ? towering walls of ancient canyons , rocks twisted by forces beyond imagining , perfect skies enhanced by pure white puffs of cloud , treelined shores and islands with sandy beaches , birds and animals , and a vastness empty of all sound but the voices of the wind and the river . To taste such a remnant of the earth 's unaltered personality , my husband and I traveled to Vernal , Utah , late one summer to run a 120 // portion of the Green River aboard a raft belonging to Hatch River Expeditions . There we met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an all-around **35;180;TOOLONG ; and Cy Wert , our boatman for the trip . Cy had come from Alabama and was a student at the University of Michigan , but despite the unlikely geography , he was an expert at navigating the Green as it raced and meandered through the ancient landscape of Colorado and Utah . Here , 150 million years ago , the dinosaurs had flourished and then failed , leaving behind a fossil record so valuable that the land ? and all its wild beauty ? has been protected as Dinosaur National Monument . For three days , the four of us would float through this timeless world , following the route taken by John Wesley Powell on his long-ago voyage of discovery , a stretch of river little changed since those early explorers navigated it and gave its major rapids their present-day names . Ironically , such time travel has its start in ordinary twentiethcentury machines ? in this case , a car ride , raft in tow , to the Lodore Ranger Station in Colorado , where we put in . But there , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with roads and cars and let the river pull us back to the Pre-Cambrian Age . As the tiny raft drifted between the huge red walls of Lodore Canyon , rocks formed at the start of geologic time , it was easy to imagine what life must have been for early humans ? small , frail , unprotected creatures surrounded by terrors beyond control . I could imagine , too , a kinship with all travelers into unknown places , cut off from ordinary lifelines of food and comfort . We were a sort of space ship , after all , completely self-contained and adrift on a course from which there was no turning back . Not that this implied an astronaut 's programmed existence or a larder of compressed food and powdered drink . Aboard our little vessel there were no computers to calculate our moves , and in our ice chest was enough fresh food to rival the menu on a Caribbean cruise . During the course of our three-day trip , we experienced as much excitement , peace , and luxury as a vacationer could hope to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could and leave no mark of our visit behind . Riding through the rapids all of which had names , like Disaster Falls , Hell 's Hall Mrlr , ( it easy fliers , Moonshine , S.O.B. , and Schoolboy we had only to hold tight , scream with a combination of exhilaration and fear , and laugh with 122 Wild , Wild Woman relief when the raft shot free of the last boulder and menacing wave . All the rest ? the expert maneuvering through the obstacle course of each rapid ? was done by Cy , who knew his waterways . Sometimes , as he guided the raft on the route he had chosen , he seemed to be steering us directly toward disaster ? a giant wave or a rock splitting the river into angry streamers of white and green . But then the wave would pass to the side or a swift arm of water would seize us and hurl us past the boulder in a rush of speed and froth . It was scary and incredibly thrilling , like a roller-coaster ride where danger is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous ; in inexperienced hands , in high water , even out of plain bad luck , a boat can get in serious trouble . But on this section of the Green , at any rate , and on most commercial river trips guided by experienced boatmen , floaters are in no more danger than they 'd be in a car on an interstate highway . At night we camped in designated areas , places we had been assigned by the park ranger before we put in . Floating has become so popular that permits are issued to avoid the kind of overcrowding and overuse that would spoil the river ? and the wilderness experience the floaters seek . On the Green , the campsites contain a table , fireplace , waste container , and chemical outhouse , which may seem a blot on the wilderness , but which are necessary to protect the land and the river . Some designated camping spots on the popular floating rivers have no facilities , but it 's now law that all river runners carry chemical toilets and garbage-removal equipment . In some places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so numerous that the environment has already suffered . But to the credit of most commercial guides , the impact on the various rivers is being kept as low as possible . These boatmen are , for the most part , dedicated outdoorsmen who love the waters they run , and they go out of their way to make sure their world is kept clean . Campouts on these float trips are a major part of the experience . This is the sociable time , with sumptuous meals and good conversation , opportunity to swim , hike , explore , or just lie around and do nothing . On our first night out , we had the campsite to ourselves , and while Cy cooked an enormous dinner of soup , creolestyle pork chops , corn , and salad , Jim Zumbo mixed a batch of martinis which we all drank out of long-stemmed glasses he had // managed to bring along . To spartan purists , such sybaritic doings might smack of decadence , but the grandeur of the place and the sense of isolation that settled on our small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our fire were no less awesome for being spiked with a touch of luxury and gin . And when we settled in our sleeping bags for the night , with the river gurgling softly nearby and the jillion stars poking through the blackness overhead , all problems of inflation , politicians , and urban sprawl had been left a million years behind . The rest of the trip passed in the same manner : enormous , delicious meals ; good conversation ; glorious scenery ; heartpounding rapids ; quiet , peaceful hours . We saw a lot of wildlife , including bighorn sheep , deer , golden eagles , Canada geese , and a great variety of birds . We even saw some skunks at our second campsite , semitame residents that behaved like conquerors and certainly were given the run of the place . That campground , called Jones Hole , had the air of an old-time rendezvous . Boats from many river outfitters stopped there for the night , and members of the various parties were milling about , exchanging glances and stories , playing guitars and singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time in days . As we floated toward our last landing spot , we took hundreds of photographs , snapping away compulsively as each bend in the river seemed to reveal a panorama more fabulous than any before , a more ominous cliff , a new color or shape to the land . We passed a huge stone wall called Steamboat Rock , from which Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid are supposed to have jumped to escape a i , osse though if this is true , the river was a lot higher or the rock a lot lower , because the way it is now a jumper could n't survive . We basked in the peace of the river , all back-home tensions washed away . We held on through 4. few more whitewater rides , almost blase veterans now . And then , all too soon , it was over . There are many float trips and outfitters in the West , and though the East has fewer , the popularity of this activity is increasing even there . The river with the most traffic is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second and third arc the M addle fork of the Salmon in Idaho and the Green . There are trips in ( ' alai or trill and , on the other side , in Arkansas , Pennsylvania , West Virginia , Maryland , and North Carolina . Actually , there arc many good 124 Wild , Wild Woman floating rivers in the East , South , and Midwest , but these are mostly run by individuals in johnboats , canoes , kayaks , outboards , or rafts . Rafting is the best way to float-camp a river with rapids , since it 's the safest way to run whitewater with a full load of gear . Since inflatable boats are being marketed in many sizes and styles at surprisingly reasonable cost , do-it-yourself rafting in areas where guides are not available ( and even where they are ) will probably become more and more popular . Anyone wishing to learn more about rafting , guided or not , will find excellent material in River Running , by Verne Huser ( Henry Regnery Co. , Chicago ) and Whitewater , by Norm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New York ) . Anyone of any age , sex , or physical condition ( within reason , of course ) can take a float trip , though it 's not recommended for children under six . Older children should love the trip , although if they ( or you ) are highly attuned to vacations complete with motel furniture and color TV , it might be best to try a few campouts first . When you set off on a multiday river trip , you ca n't call it quits in mid-run just because someone decides they 'd rather be at Disney World . Single people can join groups that are put together by commercial outfitters . On our Green River run , we saw several other rafts with large groups , all of them a healthy mix of men , women , and children , with every age except the very young set represented . Some parties were made up of friends who were sharing the cost of the trip ; others were all strangers until they boarded the raft ? though from the first rapid or first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer still . Everywhere the atmosphere was loose and relaxed , and spirits were high . There are no rules of behavior on the river except the sensible ones of generosity , good nature , and humor . You may worry a lot about your hair back at home , but on a float trip , you can let it all hang down . Another , similar way to escape the ordinary world and move apart from the familiar is on a houseboat . This may be the ultimate in riding wild ; certainly it 's the least uncomfortable , most luxurious possible way to get off the beaten track . Some people own these large , square floating homes , and some even live on them . But houseboat rentals have become a big recreational business on a number of lakes and rivcrs across the country , so vacationing in a summer house that can Riding Wild 125 go where you want and change views every day is a plausible dream . Ironically , one of the best houseboating lakes in the country , a place where wildness is almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impoundment on the Colorado between Utah and Arizona , that submerged , in its creation , some of the most magnificent and historic wilderness in the Southwest . But though the drowning of Glen Canyon remains a bitter tragedy to some , others see it as a loss with compensation . No matter how anyone feels about it , the lake now exists , and though it 's no wild river moving according to its natural pace , it 's beautiful nonetheless , a huge sprawl of torquoise water and orange-pink-red rock land with more shoreline than the entire Pacific coast , a place as remote from everyday life as the moon ? and every bit as romantic . Before the dam created the lake and the marinas came with their rental houseboats and onshore facilities , this roadless space was known to few other than wilderness wanderers and archeologists studying the remains of the Anasazi ? the Ancient Ones ? and Moki Indians , who once lived in the inhospitable canyons and disappeared mysteriously about 500 A.D. Early travelers to this harsh land arrived by river or horseback . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dusty days riding to a secret spot on the desert so he could see Rainbow Bridge , a magnificent natural arch that was sacred to the Navajo but not to the Paiute Indian , who took revenge on his tribal enemies by showing the bridge to white eyes . Grey , who believed that he would be one of the few non-Indians ever to roam this country , much less see Rainbow Bridge , celebrated the occasion in the accepted manner of explorers of the day ? by carving his name in the sacred stone . Today Rainbow Bridge and Grey 's name are still there , and so are many relics of the Indians who vanished a thousand years ago : food caches , some with the desiccated remains of pumpkins and squash still stored away ; petroglyphs and mystic symbols scratched on the walls of canyons ; small climbing holes dug in the cliff faces , called Moki ladders ; and low rock walls constructed near the very top of canyons , perhaps as hiding places from which to watch in secret when someone or something strange appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the water has risen . It has covered some of the relics and cliffs , but at the same time it has opened the awesome canyons that remain to a whole new world of people seeking escape 126 Wild , Wild Woman from cities . That they are finding it on floating boxes would have shocked Zane Grey ; what a Moki Indian observer watching from behind his wall would have thought we can only imagine . Most Lake Powell houseboating is done from two large marinas ? Wahweap , near Page , Arizona , and Bullfrog , address Hanksville , Utah , but really the middle of nowhere . We chose the latter so we could share the trip with our friends the Zumbos , not just Jim this time , but his wife , Lois , and three children ? Janette , Danny , and Judi ? as well . While they drove down on the good road connecting Bullfrog with Salt Lake , we flew in by Sky West from Las Vegas , savoring from small-plane 's eye-view the hugeness of the land , the labyrinth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other shapes and shades produced by nature from this seemingly barren ground . Most rented houseboats come with everything but bedding and food , and for our trip the Zumbos brought it all ? sheets , blankets , pillows , and enough provisions to mount an expedition to the North Pole . We could have stocked our larder almost as well from the store at the marina , but there was something about the back-and-forth trips from car to boat with box after box of meat , vegetables , staples , canned goods , fancy foods , dry goods , wet goods , milk , juice , soft drinks , beer , and cocktail makings that heightened anticipation . It was like an adventure movie ? a family packing the contents of their ancestral home into a covered wagon for a new life on the Oregon ' Frail ... missionaries preparing to sail into an unknown jungle ... yachters setting off on a Mediterranean cruise .. . or ? why not ? ? houseboaters loading every conceivable comfort for a trip into a world of their own , where man-made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and towering cliffs , which would reflect rich shades of gold or pink on the lake 's surface in the evening and morning calm . Unquestionably , houseboat living is unreal , a perfect fantasy , near total escape from household or job routine . Of course , you do cook your own meals and wash the dishes , but there 's something about a houseboat kitchen ( it 's ridiculous to call the cooking area on a floating home a galley ) that makes mealtime chores a game , like playing house . And sitting on the porch with a drink ? watching the colors flare and fade off the rocks and water , deepening to a blue unmatched in fashion or technicolor and then dropping to black // darkness , leaving you tiny and alone , waiting for the moon and milky way ? you would n't be the least surprised to hear an orchestra , heavy on the strings , playing medium-soft pop music to supplement the mood . For those who like their fantasies complete , background music can be provided via the houseboat 's tape player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Powell , the sound of golden oldies or commercials for acne medicine wo n't shatter the silence , for here no television and very little radio can get in . Houseboating can be found in less remote surroundings , too . It 's possible to houseboat on the Mississippi , on big TVA lakes in Kentucky , on Lake Shasta in California , on Sturgeon Bay in Wisconsin ? and on many other suitable lakes and rivers all across the land . It 's even possible to houseboat in your own motorhome , trailer , or tent aboard a floating pontoon-based , motor-rigged platform that can be rented on Lake Ouachita , Arkansas ; Lake Havasu , Arizona ; and Lake Hartwell , on the Georgia-South Carolina border from a Phoenix-based outfit called Camp-A-Float . But all houseboating adventures have in common the ability to go at least a little wild without having to abandon every trace of bedand-bathroom lifestyle . During our stay on Lake Powell , we secured our floating camp to shore in Cedar Canyon and spent our days bass fishing and exploring in small motorboats , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who boated out to meet us each day . In the morning we would mix fishing and sightseeing , bouncing our lures off ledges in small rock-lined inlets or splashing them across the cathedral hush of Seven-Mile Canyon , an immense bowl of red Navajo sandstone that enclosed us and shrank us to the size of bathtub toys . The walls of this huge chamber had been carved by wind and water and painted with the black markings of desert varnish into designs of such delicate beauty it seemed impossible for nature alone to have formed them . One could more easily imagine that once this place had been the banquet hall of a vanished race of giants , a room celebrated among ancients from the time of the dinosaurs and now fallen into ruin , with only the walls and traces of artwork left behind . In the oppressively hot midday hours , when summer Iishing tends to be at its worst and a nap seems the only act compatible with nature , the houseboat was especially treasured . Out of the heat , tinder the shade of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resh from the icebox , 128 Wild , Wild Woman we could sit on a chair , sleep a little on a real bed , take a swim , laze around talking , reading , or just staring at the ravens that guarded the clifftops of Cedar Canyon . Whatever we did , we could do it in real comfort till the hot , heavy hours had passed and it was possible to feel like moving again . During the time we spent on Lake Powell , we saw other people only once . Wherever we went , we were totally in our own world , and the world was wild . Our living conditions , of course , were far from primitive . Houseboating , for all its escape potential , is hardly nature in the raw . But even if this does n't qualify as wilderness living , it sure is a wild way to live . Wilder still , and on a more authentic level , is a trek into roadless country on the back of a horse . Short of foot travel , a horsepack trip is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond . And for those whose feet , backs , hearts , lungs , or mental makeup are n't up to a backpack climb , riding is the only way to reach the heights where magic wilderness ingredients like clean air and water , primeval forest , mountain vistas , and alpine meadows are stored . On a horse trip into the mountains , escape from workday complications is complete . On the trail there 's no sound but the creaking of saddle leather , the clomps of hooves on rocks or hard-packed dirt , the rush of water or wind moving the treetops , the cry of birds , and the loud snorts of horses clearing dust from their nostrils . Deep in the woods , the air is crisp , hinting of icy mountain streams and nighttime chill ; but in the clearings , sunlight spreads a lazy warmth . There 're no harsh smells at this altitude , only the tasty fragrance of untroubled air , spiced with the homely scent of horse manure and the perfume of sun-warmed , breeze-blown pine , a smell so achingly sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swells your heart with unexplainable longings . It is a smell so good that if only it could be bottled and sold to be sniffed from time to time , I 'm certain there would be no more wars . But there 's a catch to all this glory . Though a horse trip up a mountain is not the strain a backpack trip would be for an out-ofshape or unathletic adventurer , it 's not a helicopter ride either . Unless you are a practiced horseperson , or at least a Sunday trotter , it 's likely to he fraught with pain . I rode English saddle along Midwestern bridle paths for many // years when I was younger , but past experience could not prepare me for a 71/2-hour climb into the High Uinta Primitive Area that my husband and I made one August while we were in Utah . Hours of sitting on a swaying , bouncing object , knees locked into unaccustomed positions , soft-chair-pampered bottoms chafing dangerously against saddle and jeans took their toll in misery . Our guides , on the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leathery , wiry man old enough to be gray but otherwise of uncertain years , sat his horse exactly like the cattle drivers in the John Wayne movie , except he was leading a couple of stubborn pack horses instead of a herd of cattle . Rocky , about twenty , rode his horse any way he pleased , including cross-legged as if the beast were a camel , looking as comfortable and at ease as if he were in a rocking chair . Both men loved the woods , the younger one perhaps with more intensity . It was hard not to feel that should he ever have to leave the high country and trade a life of hunting , fishing , horse-riding , and woods-roaming for fifty weeks at a desk and two in Miami , he would fade and wither to nothing , like plants in windows with too little sun . These two sons of the West had not been thrilled to see us coming . Our trip had been arranged by the Utah Travel Council , an organization that likes to acquaint writers from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brick and Rocky , who make their living guiding dudes out of Moon Lake Lodge in the Uintas , clearly did n't share the tourism people 's enthusiasm for our presence . I 'm not sure if they expected us to complain a lot , fall off the horses , ride like tenderseats , or generally act like fools . Before the trip was over , we 'd pretty well covered the lot , starting with the groans ( as good-natured as possible ) and the sore bottoms ( Mike 's saddle actually drew blood ) after the first few hours . The fall from the horse came when we 'd reached the top of our climb and were looking for a good campsite . We were dismounting for a rest and consultation when my husband fell on his head , landing with a thud he swears broke a rock and I heard ten feet away . Mike did n't lose consciousness , but there must have been a slight concussion , because for about twenty minutes he did n't know who or where he was . He seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a city-dweller ? ) since he kept asking " Where 's my wallet ? " In time , his memory returned , and except for a headache , he was all 130 Wild , Wild Woman right . Lord knows what would have happened if he had n't been okay ; the nearest help was 7 ? hours away by horseback down a mountain trail . Actually , Mike 's fall came not so much from bad horsemanship as from the nature of his boots . Although they were n't the heavy hiking kind , which are impossible for horseback riding , they did have fairly thick rippled soles , and when he tried to dismount , the sole stuck in the stirrup , disturbing his balance and throwing him to the ground . It was a scary moment , but in a way it served to emphasize what wilderness travel is all about , for once you leave the roads and phones behind , you 're taking yourself into your own hands , with none of the barriers ? or cushions ? that organized society places in the path of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to depend on the not always benevolent forces of government , business , market trends , and power supplies , it 's a source of strength to practice being on your own . Despite our lack of trail-ride expertise , the guides had made their peace with us on the long climb up the mountain , and by the time our camp was established , the four of us were like long-time friends . A monstrous amount of gear had accompanied us on the pack horses , but it was off their backs and into its proper place in what seemed like no time , and before the last green-and-gold reflections of the pines had faded from the mirror surface of the drinking-water lake , we were sipping hot coffee laced with cognac and waiting for thick steaks , potatoes , carrots , and onions to cook by the campfire coals . After dinner , while we drank more coffee in the cold air and watched the stars wink through the velvety sky , we swapped stories and laughed at our sore parts . Brick told us then that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we understood him to mean that he 'd expected a good deal worse from writers from back East . Somewhere or another , he 'd had a bad experience with journalism , which is n't hard to imagine . At any rate , we did not match whatever boorish stereotype he had in mind , and so our mountain visit turned out to be a human adventure as well as an encounter with pure fresh air , crystal skies , and the calls of coyotes under a three-quarter moon . During our stay in the Uinta Primitive Area ( not a true wilderness , by official definition , because the area once was settled by man , and still is used for its timber and mineral resources as well as by backpackers , horse riders , hunters , fishermen , and day hikers ) , we // covered a good bit of territory on foot , climbing to about twelve thousand feet , which was higher than I thought my sea-level lungs could go . On the mud around the lake and the soft ground leading up to the peaks there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heights there were views in every direction to admire and photograph . And always , everywhere , there was the intoxicating aroma of fresh pine . When we left the mountain , I discovered that my earlier knee-andmuscle soreness was just a beginning . At the 40- or 50-degree angle of descent , a rider has to fight not only the saddle ( and an increasingly impatient horse ) but gravity as well . About halfway back to the ranch , I asked the guides ? begged them ? to please drape me over the saddle and tie my hands to ankles the way they do with dead bodies on TV . The seasoned horsemen laughed heartily , as if I had made an excellent joke . After such a display of confidence , I too had to treat my impulse as a comic remark . But I was n't kidding , and when we finally arrived at the corral and I slid to the ground for the final time , I was nearly as relieved as the horse was when , free of both me and the saddle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rolled . There are many horse-trip possibilities , some in the national parks of the West , some at dude ranches , some you can take on your own by renting the horses ( a specialty at Moon Lake , where we were outfitted ) . And all trail riding does n't take place on mountains , or off in the West , either . There are dude ranches in the Catskills , pack trips in Pennsylvania , horse climbs in West Virginia just about anywhere there are horses and places to ride . The best way to taste whatever degree of wildness you can get to is on an overnight trip , but for uncertain muscles , there are lots of day and half-day rides that can toughen the anatomy for longer trails and still provide a lift into a corner of the wild . Another kind of wild ride that can get you into country you do n't want to travel on your feet is the four-wheel-drive vehicle . Fourwheelers have great numbers of devotees , particularly in the West where vast acres of public land crossed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt roads , and other impassible pathways are accessible only to these tough go-anywhere machines I took a fourwheel trip into the desert outside Moab , Utah , and I can not imagine anyone going very far into this arid land any other way , at least not in the summer . The only water we crossed was laced with arsenic , and 132 Wild , Wild Woman the sun beat down on the red rock and strange , eroded shapes of the landscape with fantastic intensity . On that trip ? a Labor Day Jeep Safari held by the Moab Chamber of Commerce that attracted four-wheelers from all over the West , many with carloads of children ? we camped overnight on a long , thin mesa called the Dolores Overlook . Peering over the edge , you could see the Dolores River a thousand feet below , its wildness perfectly intact in its remote and nearly unreachable canyon . On the edge of the mesa I found the remains of a deer , scattered bones including a foreleg with hide and hoof still intact . Obviously , this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Few people ever will see a lion in the wild , and this proof of one 's passing was a rare glimpse of something totally untame . Not so untame was the high desert we had come across , not because of the four-wheelers , as critics of these off-road vehicles like to say , but because of a more menacing presence ? a huge oil-drilling rig . We could see it from our campsite , lit up against the night sky in a festoon of bulbs , like a Christmass tree to the children present , but more , I thought , like a tremendous space ship waiting to take off with the last survivors of the planet earth . This mammoth rig , which was searching deep beneath the desert for oil , had begun its treasure hunt on BLM land without the knowledge of the area residents . Surveyors and road makers preparing for the entrance of the monster had cut paths of destruction through the desert , uprooting juniper trees and flinging them into tangled heaps along the way . No amount of recreational four-wheel travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oil-seekers had made , yet the four-wheelers are often targeted as major spoilers . Ironically , if it had n't been for the planned group trailride to the Dolores Overlook , the presence of the huge machine and the ripped-up land might have stayed an official secret , known only to the drillers and the guardians of the public land . Other wild rides include canoes , kayaks , and other boats , as I noted in Chapter 7 ; float plane trips into remote wilderness fishing or hunting camps or camping areas ; and railroad trains . A few areas in the U.S. , mainly Colorado and New Mexico , still have narrow-gauge railways running through wild country , mainly as a nostalgic and scenic trip for railroad buffs , which will drop off backpackers and their gear at remote spots and pick them up again for the return . But the most regularly scheduled and used of these time-honored Riding Wild 133 wilderness rides are run by the Canadian National Railway . Up in the roadless wilds of northern Canada , trains are the only way in or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilderness travelers are regular passengers . The railroad has maps showing good places to stop and to go from there ; and for the tenderfoot , there are towns with tourist facilities and guides along the way . For a slice of Americana , a rail ride into the bush would be hard to beat . Well , one thing could top it , I suppose ? and that 's a ride on a hotair balloon . Ballooning , a sport for the intrepid many years ago , including a number of daring women , is now gathering more fans . It 's a splendid way to travel ? gliding silently above the treetops ( until the noisy propane burner has to be put on to lift you out of trouble ) , casting a long and delightful shadow on the ground . I took a balloon ride once with Bob Wallagunda , who manned the familiar Lark balloon , and after a lovely float over the New Jersey countryside , we came in for a bump-along landing in the middle of a marsh , watched by gaping motorists who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera . Small children who had seen our descent begin came running from yards and houses far around , and as the wind carried us along the ground toward a large hedgerow , dozens of little hands grabbed the basket and dragged it deftly to dry ground . There , like a princess , I could step out without wetting my feet . Balloons , Bob told me , have definite sporting applications , such as trolling , whereby the gondola is drifted a few feet over the water while the balloonist pulls a lure behind . From a practical standpoint , I suppose ballooning will never really catch on as a means of catching fish , or even of riding wild . But if you ever want a good wild ride then it 's something to keep in mind . " Let us walk in the white snow In a soundless space ; With footsteps quiet and slow , At a tranquil pace , Under veils of white lace . " ? From " Velvet Shoes , " by ELINOR WYLIE . " Winter is icumen in , lhude sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POUND . I am not one of those hardy admirers of nature who love all seasons equally and all the wide variety of weather as one . Winter , for example , is something I could pretty well leave alone , if I were given the choice . Not that I do n't enjoy a crisp , sunny day with the snow sparkling on fence posts and turning ordinary growing things into wonderlands of white . I still remember the excitement I felt when I 'd awaken in my childhood bed in Illinois to find the windowpanes so thick with frost I 'd have to clear a space with hot breath to see if additional snow had fallen during the night . I also remember the joys of hurling my snowsuited self into drifts of powder so deep they would almost bury my hat , or of falling backward in the untouched blanket covering the backyard and sweeping my arms and legs in careful arcs to make the first snow angel of the season . I have other happy winter memories : playing Foxes and Geese at the end of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety pins at the ends of my sleeves ; ice skating on my ankles while a loud speaker played the " Blue Danube , " and later , on rivers that heaved and creaked behind me as I sped desperately toward shore . And once a friend and I rolled what must have been the biggest snowman bottom ever constructed , much taller than the two of us and finally almost impossible to move . It was miles from home , and when my mother came to pick me up I tried to persuade her to rope it and drag it behind the car to our backyard where , with the help of ' a ladder and my own tall father , the rest of the world 's biggest snowman could be made . 136 // During those years of eating ice and floundering through snowpiles till my outer layer was covered with frozen pellets of wool , I did n't seem to mind being cold . I mind it now , however . Something has gone wrong with modern snowsuits ? or else something has gone wrong with me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture merrily hissing radiators or log fires on the one hand , and on the other , weather so awful that not even the most fanatical outdoor person would want to leave the hearth . But despite my lack of enthusiasm for cold weather , I must admit that winter has a lot to offer . Snow can work magical changes on even the dreariest places if it falls in moderation , and windless frosty air ) rings out the best in cheeks and eyes ? although it tends to be less kind to noses . Dressed warmly enough , it 's possible to accept the world between fall and spring on reasonably friendly terms , provided record cold spells and snowfalls do n't bring unusual hardship . Of course , not everyone shares my reservations about the season . Hordes of people , including increasing numbers of women , can barely wait for the snows to fall so they can risk their life on lake ice , mountain drifts , and downhill runs . Much as I enjoy watching someone like Rosie Mittermeyer attack a peak or Suzie Chaffee dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the downhill game . I suppose my antipathy has much to do with a certain New Year 's Day when I made my first ? and last ? attempt at downhill skiing . The circumstances were not propitious . The hill was on a golf course in northern Wisconsin . It was very steep , and covered with a sheet of ice . In order to ski down , you had to climb up ; but the only way to do this was in a sort of crawl , hands outstretched for balance , skis pushed on ahead . Near the top there was a little ledge , more of a bump really , where it was possible to sit and attach skis to feet . Once you stood up , however , you were headed down , with your life flashing before your eyes . There was no time for style or preparation or Transendental Meditation ? there was n't even time to change your mind . For reasons I no longer understand , I repeated this crawl-up , hurtle-down maneuver over and over that afternoon . My only skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't let me fall till I get to the bottom " with enough conviction to keep me upright till I - 138 Wild , Wild Woman was past the ice and onto the softer snowfields below . My only emotion was pure terror . For many years after that day , I stayed as far away from skis and skiing as possible . But then a sport long popular in Scandinavia began to catch on here , and I decided to give the snow another try . The activity , which changed my mind about skiing and in part about cold weather , too , is cross-country skiing , or ski touring , Nordic skiing , X-ski , or X-C , as it is also known . Even though it does take place in winter , this is a marvelous way to spend your time . It has all the attributes of a true field sport , unlike downhill , which requires a specially prepared area and a lot of permanent machinery to get you up the hill . Ski touring can be done almost anywhere ? in a snow-covered woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , or any open place , even the backyard , a local park , or a nearby road . The first time I ever saw a cross-country skier was in the mid-sixties when a terrible snowstorm had wiped out New York City , burying everything and outlawing all traffic but buses and emergency vehicles . One twilit evening after work while the rush-hour walkers slipped and slid on the snow pack , a man appeared out of nowhere , dressed in knickers and knee socks , sweater and stocking cap , flying down Fifth Avenue on skis . The pedestrians to a person stopped and stared till he 'd dashed out of sight , his feet with the long runners flashing like Hans Brinker 's skates . New Yorkers may have seen everything , but till that moment I doubt that any of us had seen a sight like this . Since that time , the sport of ski touring has become well known and very much a part of the American winter recreational scene . Every year additional converts join the flock , some as fugitives from the downhill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines ; some as former indoor people abandoning fireside comfort for a bracing glide through the snow . Age , sex , athletic ability , strength , or skill are not important to enjoyment of the sport , although this is no sissy occupation as some daredevil downhillers claim . Actually , it can be as hard and rugged as you want it to be ? and as moderate , too . For this reason , X-C is an excellent family sport , one that grandparents and young children ( provided the trips are n't too ambitious ) can enjoy along with the hardier set . W hen I decided to try my hand at touring I thought about practicing in Central Park , as many people I know have done . But it // seemed more adventurous to go all out and head for some real winter woods up north , so along with my husband , several friends , and a large black Tibetan mastiff named Ivan , I want to New Hampshire . Even in March this state has lots of snow , and there are plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unnecessary , since the long , narrow skis used in this sport can take you through any kind of snow and up and down all sorts of terrain , provided the ski bottoms are properly waxed for the snow conditions . But trails make matters easier , especially for someone out of practice and for people whose muscles have n't yet been introduced to cross-country skis . In the past few years the number of trails fanning out from ski-rental places and instruction centers has grown tremendously , as have trails at resorts once managed exclusively for the downhill crowd , and at almost any likely spot in snow country . Since we had been lucky enough to borrow a house near Lake Winnipesauki in New Hampshire for our skiing trip , we chose the trails at Waterville Valley to tour , but we could have taken our pick from well over a hundred touring centers in New England . Although lessons were available at the excellent center at Waterville Valley for a very reasonable fee , we were anxious to get moving after a giant lunch , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of instruction . In a way this was foolish , since there is more to the X-C game than merely staying upright . But it certainly proved that anybody , even a person with no prior experience and very little ability , can enjoy the activity . My companions had all had downhill training , and all of us had seen X-C on television , so we had some idea how to proceed . Though none of us were very elegant , we managed to move along with few problems , though I was not very good at staying upright when the trail went down . Generally , the problem of descending can be solved by dropping to the ground when the going gets unsure , though on ominously steep hills , especially ones that lead to a narrow ice bridge cr ossing a cold , fast-running stream , cowardice may seem the better part of common sense ? which means taking off the skis and walking down . Anyway , that 's what I did , and would continue to do till I leaf ned to manage a decent downhill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slopes , I learned that you 're not supposed to put your weight forward but 140 Wild , Wild Woman should keep it centered over your heels , with knees slightly bent , in order to hold your balance on a downgrade . I also discovered that fear of falling can make you fall ? though I should have known this from many previous abortive attempts to walk over stream-bridging logs . Actually , on the intermediate-grade trail we selected for our maiden voyage ( we could have taken a beginner 's way but were n't smart enough for that ) there were only about three off-with-the-skis hills , though there were lots of falls anyway . The worst part about falling was not crashing to the ground ? I was ready for that ? but the attempts to get up again . I kept thinking that the long , thin skis were firmly attached to my feet , forgetting that on a touring ski , the heel is not tied down . This means that you can bend your knee and ankle just as if there were no large piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up as easily as I 'd gotten down , the fear of falling seemed less bothersome and staying up became easier . I mention all this to show how informal ski touring can be . Obviously , a lesson or two before plowing off into the wilds is a sensible precaution , and instruction is relatively easy to obtain . As with everything else , it 's getting more expensive , but it is still possible to obtain half-day lessons complete with equipment rental for no more than a ticket on a ski lift , and many ski resorts now offer touring deals , with room , equipment rental , and instruction included in one price . An inquiry to your local newspaper c/ o the outdoor editor should help you find a nearby touring school , and Ski magazine puts out a yearly Guide to Cross Country Skiing that lists places to learn and practice throughout the U.S. and Canada . If no classes are readily available , or you do n't want to bother with formalities , it does n't really matter . Even if you have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun . Equipment for ski touring is not much more complicated than the basic steps . Gear includes Nordic-type skis , poles , and boot-shoes with soles squared off in front to fit the toe bindings on the skis . All XC skis used to be wooden , but now ? thanks to the manufacturing activity that popularity always draws to a sport ( along with higher prices ) ? there are skis of fiberglass and metal , and ones with special bottoms that do n't require waxing . Stylish knickers , knee socks , jackets , vests , gloves , and hats now hang among the skis and poles in fashionable shops , though lots of tourers still go with the rummage // look popular in the days before X-C styles could be found . However you choose to dress , comfort and safety should be the prime considerations . This means layers of clothes and lots of wool . I can face the cold with reasonable aplomb if I am outfitted in thermal underwear , one or two wool sweaters , a wool button-up shirt , and a windproof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overstuffed patchwork pillow , but I can move easily enough , and most important , I can stay warm . Warmer-blooded types may tour with perfect comfort in nothing more than a sweater and down vest ? though normally several layers of clothes are preferable , so you can add or subtract warmth as your body needs it . Although I wear jeans in the snow , this is not advised , since cotton sops up water and stays wet for ages , sucking heat from your body like an air-conditioner . So far , I have n't had any trouble , because I 've stuck to hard , dry snow . But everyone including me would be wise to get a pair of wool or synthetic-material pants ( knickers are the big fashion in this sport ) for snowtime wear . The advantage of wool is that it not only sheds moisture , but keeps you warm even when it does get wet . The new synthetic fiberfills , such as Dacron II and Polar Guard , do the same . In addition to whatever number of layers your personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mittens or gloves , and some sort of covering for the head . Bright-colored hats not only add a jaunty look that can be seen for miles in case you need rescuing , but they will keep you from losing a huge amount of body heat out of the unprotected head . Actually , warm hats are important for all winter activities . It 's a little like putting insulation in the attic ; if there 's enough , the house will be comfortable ; but if there is n't any , the place might freeze . A good meal before a cold-weather outing is also important to keep your furnace going . Dashing through the snow takes a lot of energy , and unless you plan just to mess around throwing snowballs at trees , even a big starchy meal wo n't have time to turn to flab . Dieters might be eying such strenuous sports as X- ( ' as an easy way to burn off stubborn fat reserves , but it does n't work that way . 1 he main result you 'll get from hitting a winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold . Another activity making the transition from wilderness transportation to popular sport is snowshoeing . Wearing the footwear of 142 Wild , Wild Woman mountain men like Jedediah Smith or the rugged outdoor people of later times like that intrepid woodswoman Shirley Hulse , who walked the snows in 1912 , more and more people today are rediscovering the joys of moving silently through winter-choked forests , walking beside the tracks of rabbits or bobcats on the skin of deep-drifted snow . Although ski-touring is far more widespread , snowshoeing has an advantage for those impatient to get off the trails and into the trackless wastes : it 's easier to learn . About the only problem beginners have is stepping on their own shoes , which is no big thing , except when it 's time to take the next step . Even these mishaps are less likely if you use long , thin snowshoes rather than the wider , shorter bear-paw type , which may be more maneuverable in the woods but are harder to control if you 're not used to their size . Today a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of aluminum tubing and neoprene platforms ( as opposed to the traditional woodand-rawhide shoes the old-time woodsmen wore ) is gaining in popularity because of its light weight , durability , and maneuverability . Sherpas may be a long stride from the old mountain-man tradition , but just because a thing is new does n't mean it ca n't be any good . When one-time woodswoman Shirley Hulse first stepped into snowshoes , she charged right up a 3,000-foot mountain ( or so she said ) , which may demonstrate how readily a beginner can learn to walk on snow . Nevertheless , this is n't something the average person ought to try . Although snowshoeing may be an easily mastered skill , it 's not exactly like walking on the road . There are those big platforms attached to each foot , after all , and in order to move , you have to lift your legs more than you may be used to . A lot of high stepping will put a strain on thigh muscles that can make you wish for a quick death . Even the French-Canadians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and livelihood knew the pain of an overworked upper leg . They called the problem mal de raquette , a pretty name for a miserable disaster . Unless a lot of preconditioning has taken place , it is a wise snowshoer who does n't travel mountains or plan to cover miles the first few times on the webs . Another hazard of snowshoeing , as with skiing , skating , building snow forts , or just crossing a snow-covered street , is falling down . Hcrc again , the hardest part of the crash may not be going down but // getting up again . Experts supposedly do this effortlessly by kneeling on the front of their snowshoes and lifting off from there . An easier way is to crawl to the nearest tree and let it help you rise . Besides being an enjoyable activity in its own right , permitting you to poke into the quiet secrets of the winter woods , snowshoeing is a way that many other outdoor sports can be enjoyed long after the ordinary boot wearers have been stuck in the snow . Winter campers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time-honored transportation a good ? if not the only ? way to get around . And for some enthusiasts , the pleasure is less practical than historic , for on snowshoes it is possible to commune directly with the spirit and practices of the past , when the North American wilderness was the exclusive territory of the Indians , trappers , and explorers who trekked the unmapped north country , learning its rugged face in a way that could n't have been done by other means ? at least not until the snowmobile arrived . Snowmobiling , depending on your point of view , is either the greatest thing since central heating or the Devil 's revenge on modern society . I take a neutral stand . When used improperly , illegally , or inconsiderately , there is no question that snowmobiles are a scourge . But there 's a lot of room in the great outdoors , especially when it 's covered with snow , and I see no reason why snowmobilers ca n't have their share of the territory , as long as the wilderness and the wilderness walkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snowmobile controversy undoubtedly stems from the tremendous boom the machines enjoyed during the early 1960s . People who had been housebound by snow suddenly were released from bondage , or so they felt . Even where people snowshoed and skied , the gas-powered sled was greeted as a blessing , an end to the long winters of discontent . I got my first glimpse of a snowmobile-enlivened society in 1967 in Jackman , Maine , where I had gone to try some landlocked salmon fishing with my husband and some friends . It was Memorial Day weekend , and ice-out was just a few weeks old . ' Ie day before we arrived some eight inches of snow had dropped onto the high country near the small town , and the weather was icy cold . At the time , Jackman was putting sewer pipes down along the main street , and there was n't much in the way of paving around I he place had a frontier look to it , as though it should have been a Western movie set 144 Wild , Wild Woman or somewhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trapped one might feel when the snows buried this far-north town . But in the driveway of almost every home was the escape machine , a shiny snowmobile , often in far better shape than the family car . If you mentioned this phenomenon to the Jackmanites , eyes would light up with enthusiasm as they spoke of the good times that had replaced the dreariness and isolation that winter used to mean . Before the snowmobile , they had been severely restricted in their movements , but now they could travel miles away from town , over impassable roads , and rendezvous ( or tryst ) in the woods , hold snowmobile races , cross the frozen lake to fish through the ice , have barbecues and get-togethers ? in short , enjoy the outdoors as freely as they did in summer in this outdoor-oriented town . Although opposition to snowmobiling seems to have grown as more wilderness seekers come on the scene , the activity has tamed down considerably from its early , somewhat unrestricted days . The motors still make noise , but they have been muffled ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high , infuriating buzzroar produced by motorcycles , snowmobiles , and minibikes when the muffler has been illegally removed ) . Most important , responsible groups of snowmobilers have worked hard for good behavior on the part of those who enter their ranks . Some unreconstructed hotrodders still ride over people 's lawns or fields without permission , toss litter wherever they go , chase wildlife , cross landscapes where they do n't belong , and engage in other forms of . destructive or dangerous behavior . But such outlaw action is not the general rule . Besides , snowmobiles have valuable uses aside from recreation . When blizzards devastate an area , as happened with the great snows of 1977 , snowmobilers are often the only ones able to move , and there are many stories of individuals and clubs responding to the need by transporting doctors , injured people , medical supplies , and food , as well as aiding with various emergencies that only their machines could get to at the time . It 's possible to rent snowmobiles at many resorts and trail sites in snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though most snowmobilers own their own machines ? often on a his and hers basis . The sport does n't require a lot of strength , but it does take skill , and it 's not something to leap into without instruction . It 's also not a sport to try with any old thing from the closet on for // warmth . These machines move fast enough to set up a stiff breeze , so clothing that can protect you from the wind-chill as well as the thermometer is needed . The best apparel is a snowmobile suit ? a one-piece insulated garment with a tough , wind-resistant outer shell ? and snowmobile boots , usually felt-lined and made of waterproof and windproof material . These clothes are also good for ice fishing and bass fishing on a cold day , so they more than justify their presence in an outdoor wardrobe . One good compromise between the quiet old ways and the newfangled invention is to put the snowmobile to work transporting goods to a deep-woods base camp , like a wagon or horse-train or jeep . Feild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on X-C skis , worked out such a trip near Yellowstone Park one winter , riding to an isolated spot on a Ski-Doo , toting a sled loaded with such gear as a spacious tent , a multiburner stove , normalweight food , and a thick foam mattress , as well as numerous other camping comforts he could n't possibly have carried on his back . After he had set up a base camp , he spent his days ski-touring the countryside in silent travel and his nights in what can only be called luxury , considering where he was . He was even able to drive to town one evening for a meal and a few sociable beers before returning to his tent for the night . This may not be camping as the mountain men understood the word , but it sure takes the sting out of winter nights . Winter camping , even of this well-equipped variety , is n't everybody 's idea of fun , but a growing number of people are taking it up because of the relative emptiness of the campgrounds and hiking trails in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay out overnight ? and a number of backpackers have taken up skiing so they can camp in the snow . For those with lots of skiing and camping experience , wilderness snow tours into remote mountain areas are possible and no doubt memorable , but not for the beginner or the untrained . Luckily , overnighting for skiers does n't have to take place in a far-off campsite . A number of trail systems connect to huts , campgrounds , heated dormitories , Youth Hostels , or ( for my type ) hotels or inns , so a traveler can ski all day without retracing steps , yet not have to spend the night on the ground . More to the taste of the nonhardy or the family with small children are the conventional camping methods , such as the motorhome or the pop-up tent . The big problem with recreational vehicles in the cold is 146 Wild , Wild Woman the same problem with vacation homes : the pipes tend to freeze . Some new RVs are coming out with insulated pipes as an option , and handy people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble , since many ski resorts and places catering to cold-weather sports are putting in facilities for RVs . Many campgrounds close down for the winter , especially where snow and cold are severe enough to keep people away till spring . But where camping is possible year-round , even tenters will camp , and for those so inclined , modern equipment is a blessing . Not only are there all the regular summertime wonders ( with a few seasonal corrections where required ) , but there are such cold-weather wonders as catalytic heaters that wo n't set things on fire or suffocate sleepers , and bright portable lights to help you cook and go to bed , or ( if you 're really into family camping ) change the baby 's diaper in the early dark of a winter night . Once you 're nestled in your cozy sleeping bag , keeping warm may be no problem , and there 's much to be said for the romance of stars and a diamond-bright moon in a frosty black sky . But until you 're ready to be romantic , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People who are really into winter can get their fill of the season by attending a winter-skills or survival-training course . There are several such programs , mostly in the West . Among them is a mountain-skitraining course given by the National Outdoor Leadership School , of Landers , Wyoming , which teaches you such winter camping tricks as digging snow caves and setting up a kitchen in a waist-deep drift . Another course is given by Outward Bound , which teaches snow camping , skiing , and staying alive . For emphasis on ski touring , there 's Royal Gorge Ski Touring , Inc. , of Soda Springs , California , and for instruction in mountain safety there 's the American Avalanche Institute , of Wilson , Wyoming . Those who want training in how to survive , period , can try the NRA survival course at Raton , New Mexico , where classes in basic survival are followed by a stretch of learning-by-doing in which participants are effectively " lost " for a few days with no food or sleeping bags in the mountain cold . In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many local programs teaching survival and winter-camping techniques by lesson and example . We came upon one such exercise in Waterville Valley as we skied through the deepening shadows of // late afternoon . We could hear voices ringing through the crisp , chill air before we could see anyone , but then we topped a rise and there they were ? a group of bright-eyed , red-cheeked youngsters breathing smoke , scattered among the pines in stocking caps and down jackets of purple , red , green , blue , and yellow , busily darting back and forth or popping up and down like benevolent trolls in an enchanted woods . It turned out that they were sixteen boys and girls in the sixth through ninth grades from the Renbrook Middle School of West Hartford , Connecticut . They 'd come to the New Hampshire woods on something called Discovery Week , a unique school program that lets the students escape the classroom for a week and see what 's happening in the larger , sometimes cruel , cold world . Most pupils tend to choose culture centers with museums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter . When we arrived on the scene , the group was busily constructing shelters of their own design , reflecting fairly ingenious though not always successful engineering schemes . Guided by the Waterville Valley naturalist , Tracy Keller , and their teachers from the school , the students had dug snow caves roofed over with boughs and pieces of bark and wood foraged from the forest , and they had piled blocks of snow they 'd cut from drifts with their skis , trying for igloos , though they were n't necessarily recognizable as such . The kids were having a good time , but under it all was the understanding that when night fell , it was going to get uncomfortably cold . Sometime later , I contacted one of their teachers , Thom Perkins , and asked how the overnight had gone . Not without problems , he told me . The plan had called for a hot meal before the long night began , but they could n't get a cooking fire going , so supper was scratched . They had plenty of chocolate and pepperoni to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their snow nests and sleeping bags with at least some internal defense against the night . The temperature was about 20 degrees , and in the protection of the shelters , sleep came easily enough . Around two in the morning , though , Thom Perkins awoke suddenly feeling that something was wrong . At first he could n't tell what it was ; snow shelters are very quiet , and everything was still . Then he realized that the air had 148 Wild , Wild Woman become so cold it was difficult to breathe . Later they learned that in about twenty minutes the temperature had dropped to less than 5 degrees . Problems and all , the survival experience was quite a discovery for these youngsters ? a real taste of winter without the protective shield we have come to take so much for granted in our central-heated times . They had learned that with no help from most of the ordinary trappings of civilization , they could survive . One day they might have to do the same again , even inside their own homes , cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does happen , that night in the New Hampshire snow will have importance beyond the lessons of the day . Winter has always been a hard time in the places where the temperature drops to the bottom and snows cover the landscape . It can be a disastrous time , too , destroying crops , overtaxing fuel supplies , disrupting lives ? even killing some . But before we had the comfortable way of life our oil-burning , gas-burning , electric-heated homes provide today , people lived through winter . They even enjoyed the season . It might be a good idea for us to remember their techniques , since recent Western snow droughts notwithstanding , - it does n't look as if the cold days are going to go away . My mother , who was born before the turn of the century , grew up in a farming community in Michigan , where winter brought tremendous isolation yet it was her favorite season . She says it was the time of her best memories , because there was so much to do . Her favorite sport was something they called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rides hitched on the horse-drawn sleds that farmers used to haul things in to town . They would ride way out into the country , then jump off and wait for another sled to come by so they could hop on and ride back home . Sometimes another sled never arrived ? but that was the risk in the game . Horsedrawn sleds are gone , and winter sports have become more organized , but there 's still plenty of spontaneous fun to be had . Those who find snowmobiling , snowshoeing , or cross-country skiing more activity than they 're prepared to accept can still find enticements that make leaving the house or taking a weekend at a winter resort worthwhile . There 's sledding , for example , which does n't call for too much exertion or nerve ( though once upon a time I sledded regularly down some steep winding roads that were hairy enough to stop a pc ' son 's breathing ) . Ice skating is another wonderful way to get // through the winter , though this takes some straining , especially till you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sport is poorly fitting skates , which usually explains why people who have tried it only in rented equipment get discouraged . Anyone considering taking up skating as a regular exercise/ hobby should spend the money for a really good-fitting pair of skates . Both sledding and skating are available just about anywhere in the snow belt . At resorts , the nonathletic reluctant winter outdoorperson may also be able to go out for tobogganing , or even hay rides , which require no effort at all . If even this seems like too much to master , there 's always downhill sliding on a Frisbee-like plastic sled ( or a Frisbee , for that matter ) or a nice piece of cardboard box . Kids love this ; and who said big people ca n't take a minute out now and then to be kids ? Although downhill skiers tend to be locked into a controlled world of ski lifts and manicured mountains , some intrepid souls are going back to the old ways , the snow life before the lifts , and are making their own paths up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own terrain . But even for those who follow standard procedure the slopes can hold surprises both ridiculous and sublime . My friend Lucia , a woman of great beauty and wit , but cursed with an extraordinary penchant for foolish accidents , once went to an elegant ski resort in Chile , where she grew up . The lifts up the mountain were of the J-bar type , and as she neared the top where riders drop their hold and glide off toward the trails , her feet slipped out from under her and one of her skis shot upward , jamming into the lift mechanism above . As she dangled upside down attached to the overhead track by her wedged-in ski , her head a few feet above the ground ? the machinery ground to a halt . Up and down the mountain , skiers were stuck , hanging onto their . I-bars with stretched-out arms . From top to bottom , people were shouting and cursing poor Lucia , who hung helplessly , trapped in a ski that held her suspended in the air . No one asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the binding of her ski . Furious , the lilt operators simply grabbed her by the leg and ski and pulled till they jerked her free of the machine . Once the ski was loose , they dropped I ucia to the ground , then banished her permanently from the slopes . Since this was her first day at the resort , the banishment was something of a disaster . Or it might have been , had a movie crew not 150 Wild , Wild Woman arrived just then to shoot footage of this place . As soon as the director saw Lucia sitting beautifully by the ice rink drinking hot chocolate , he asked her to join his film . Could she skate ? No ? Well , never mind . Thus , on the finished film which appeared all over Chile and , no doubt , the world , there was a lovely shot of Lucia gliding gracefully between two handsome men on the ice at the famous resort . What the film did n't show was that the men were holding Lucia up by the elbows while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friend 's double-faced day on the unforgiving slopes of Chile is not just a great moment in the history of the absurd , but a perfect winter allegory . On the one hand , the season may seem an unmitigated disaster , a dreariness beyond redemption . But give it a closer look , or at least a second chance , and who knows what compensations might be coming ? " Nature is free . We must find out how to enjoy our heritage of freedom . " ? MARY L. T. BROWN , Gems for the Taking ( The Macmillan Company , New York , 1971 ) " Nature waits upon thee still And thy verdant cup does fill , ' T is fill 'd wherever thou dost tread , Nature 's Self 's thy Ganirnede " ? ABRAHAM COWLEY , The Grasshopper . Although I 'm an enthusiastic booster of most of the activities I have covered so far , it would be hypocritical and false of me to pretend an uncritical love that never lapses into boredom when things get dull . There are many times when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake ; when even my much-loved canoeing becomes a hot and uncomfortable drudgery . Since I have these occasional hostilities toward activities I normally enjoy , I can sympathize with people who care nothing for fishing and the rest , and therefore have come to believe that they could n't possibly care about the outdoors . But though I understand this feeling , I ca n't agree with it . Unless you have developed a downright hatred for the open air , there 's too wide a range of possibilities to give up on nature just because major kinds of outdoor sport do n't turn you on . Anytime I go off on an outing , I try to have an alternative activity to turn to in case the primary goal goes wrong . At one time , the alternate was painting . Whenever we 'd go fishing , I 'd carry my box of oil paints and some canvas boards along . As soon as I became convinced that no amount of casting was going to bring in a fish , I would switch to smearing colors on canvas in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once , after a few futile , cold spring days of trout fishing on the Beaverkill in the Catskill region in New York , I gave up , and while my husband and our friends doggedly cast on , I sat on the stream bank and opened my paints . After a while it started to snow , great , fat flakes that nearly blotted out the landscape as they fell gently in the windless air . I snickered inwardly at the fishing fools who kept on dropping lures in the icy black water while snow piled up on their heads . And they snickered openly at me , 152 And That 's Not All 153 painting away , completely covered in a shroud of white . All of us were happy , though , despite our mutual lack of success at our chosen game . We had come outdoors in pursuit of a goal , and not even lousy weather could interfere . Unfortunately , I was a terrible painter , and in time , this seemed even more frustrating than not catching fish . That 's when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sport in its own right , an excellent accompaniment to any outing , and a perfect way to save an otherwise imperfect day . In the hands of a skilled master , photography is a high art , and not everyone is capable of creating masterpieces on film . But unlike painting , it 's something that anyone can learn to do at least pleasingly , and with great personal satisfaction . We all perceive the world in our own special way , whether in terms of panoramas or tiny patterns of color and form : one person 's forest is another person 's tree . With camera in hand , each of us can focus on our own point of view and capture it , sharing our individual eye with others and keeping a permanent reminder of its special vision to enjoy later . For nature photography , the most versatile type of camera is the 35mm single-lens reflex , or SLR . These cameras provide two main benefits : whatever you see through the viewfinder is what you 'll record on film ; and you can change lenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thus increasing the range of pictures you can get . Unfortunately , these cameras also have dials that must be set before a properly exposed photo can be shot . This has kept many people of otherwise reasonable intelligence convinced that photography is beyond their ken . When I first got interested in picture taking ( as opposed to picture painting ) I was as awed by the thought of f stops , shutter speeds , and exposure meters as a Stone Age man might be if a juke box were suddenly delivered to his cave . Like the tribal peoples who refuse to have their picture taken , convinced that the box imprisons souls , I feared that in the presence of a camera I might he robbed of my wits . Because of these superstitions , the camera I chose was a small , very simple model that needed almost no adjusting and permitted little self-expression . In time , the limitations of the camera began to outweigh my fear of complexities , and I succumbed to an SLR , encouraged by a photographer friend who assured me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to operate an electric stove can learn photography . In general , I have found this to be true , though I still have trouble with some of the more intricate electric stoves . Such camera fears are actually quite common , especially among women . Although there are a good many women who have become professional photographers , they are often considered an oddity , like female race-car drivers . Photographer Eve Arnold , who has made her living taking remarkable pictures for many years , and has recently published a collection titled Unretouched Women ( Knopf , New York ) , still finds herself described as a " woman photographer , " a qualifier that should be obvious from her name alone , if anybody cared . Perhaps the idea that " photographer " means " man " unless otherwise noted stems from the time-honored notion that any machine which does not sew , wash , or pick up dirt is beyond the powers of female understanding . Wherever it stems from , it 's wrong , and if it keeps an otherwise interested person from developing a camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who still feel that setting dials is more than they can handle , there is a way to discover the pleasures of picture taking . Almost every maker of top-quality SLRs today offers an automatic camera with all the features of the manual kind except the dial setting . With automation , you need only decide on a shutter speed ( with brands such as Konica or Canon automatic ) or an f stop ( on brands such as Pentax and Olympus ) . All other decisions , except focusing , which must be done for each picture with any good camera , are made electronically inside the magic box . I own a Leicaflex , which I use in most situations , but I also have a Konica T3 automatic , because there are times when I do n't want to have to think about anything but picking up the camera and grabbing a shot . Mastering the not very difficult technique of SLR operation is not all there is to taking photographs . Good pictures depend on the judgment and decisions of the person behind the lens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by reading or attending photo courses . A good book on outdoor photography is Camera Afield , by Sid Latham ( Stackpole Books , Harrisburg , Pa. ) , and Kodak puts out a large number of manuals on virtually every aspect of picture-taking . Even better is a class given by someone who can make the intricacies clear and inspire confidence . Thanks to the incredible upsurge in amateur photography in recent years , such And That 's Not All 155 courses are fairly widespread . I was lucky enough to attend one of the seminars given by Walter Heun and sponsored by Leica dealers in cities throughout the country . Anyone spending two days at one of these sessions will become not only better able to take good photos , but inspired to take them as well . One of the great benefits of exploring the world with a camera is that it forces you to look at the parts of any whole ? to see the presence and personality of bushes , leaves , flowers , weeds , and grass , not just the jumbled mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a fragment of any scene , and as you walk around , framing different portions of a distant mountain range or a cozy wooded glen , you discover a hundred different pictures where your eyes might have seen just one . This is why looking at a book of photographs by Eliot Porter , for example , or Ernst Haas , or Ansel Adams is sometimes more satisfying that looking at nature in the raw . Peering into distances with a telephoto lens is another exciting way to enlarge or change your point of view . Things look strange when seen through this medium , for the lens not only pulls images to you , it also pulls them to each other , so objects actually ten feet apart seem to be separated by no more than inches . The telephoto lens will also look right through solid matter , or so it seems ; focus on a leaf twenty feet away , then keep on focusing toward infinity , and the leaf will simply vanish , fade away , disintegrate before your eyes . There 's a perfectly rational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X-ray vision , but I prefer to think of it as magic , and often entertain myself happily just making obstacles disappear . Telephoto lenses are essential for wildlife photography , unless you are picture-taking at a zoo ( a perfectly legitimate way to gather your own animal collection if you ca n't afford an African or Alaskan safari ) . Getting good shots of wildlife in their natural habitat is a tough job . Depending on what you 're after , you may have to climb mountains , hang from a cliff , sit without moving for hours , or stalk carefully and quietly till you find your quarry . Usually those great shots of brown bears catching salmon or bighorn sheep batting heads are the result of considerable planning , waiting , watching , and hard work . Sometimes you get lucky and surprise a baby ram with his mother drinking from the river 's edge as you float into view , as happened to us on the Green River ? or you turn a corner on a road and come face to face with a family of pronghorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take their picture , as happened while we were driving through Flaming Gorge Recreational Area in Utah . Or you can crouch uncomfortably for half a day waiting for something to appear and end up with nothing but a sore back . One morning I snuck out into the sparse grass cover on Fire Island , a long sandbar off Long Island , New York , hoping to entice one of the local foxes with a predator call . Every few minutes I set up a piercing squeal that was supposed to imitate a wounded rabbit , though it sounded more like a group of angry pigs to my ears . But no foxes ever came . Luckily , no people ( or pigs ) came either . Another satisfactory form of nature photography that does n't depend on something coming to you is close-up , or macro , work , which lets you photograph a level of reality your own eyes could never see . This is my favorite photographic sport , something that can be done anywhere and almost any time , passing many hours in the fascinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get good shots with a set of modestly priced glass close-up lenses that attach to a regular lens , for really powerful magnification you need a macro lens , which can capture the life size of things on film . Snooping ? as photographer Lenny Gordon calls this form of exploration ? reveals the secret heart of flowers , the veins of leaves , the presence of insects so tiny that without the magic lens you would never have known they were there . The lens also transforms the ordinary into fantasy . In a series of slides I once took of a flaming trumpet vine , the flower stems have turned into rocket blasts or comet trails , and two withered blossoms have become dragons engaged in battle . Insects are another fascinating study for the macro lens , although under ordinary circumstances , it 's hard to keep them still . Low temperature , however , will put them into suspended animation . Once on a cold June day we found a gallery of inert dragonflies that could n't help but sit for their portrait ; and later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cue from this experience and put a few on ice till their metabolism had slowed enough to make them perfect subjects . Since macro photography is so much fun , and offers such an endlessly fascinating possibility for pictures , anyone setting out to buy an SLR would do well to consider buying a camera body and a macro lens ( which focuses from infinity down to an inch or so from And That 's Not All 157 the subject ) , forgoing the so-called normal lens ( which will focus no closer than eighteen or so inches ) that usually comes with the purchase . It might cost a little more , but since the macro will also serve as a regular lens , you are getting two units in one , and increasing your photographic pleasure . Since SLR cameras are expensive , and also quite heavy , many photographers are taking up the new small 35mm models , many of which are automatic , and most of which weigh well under a pound . All these little cameras are rangefinders , however , which means that what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get on film . This is no great problem ; most cameras of this type have framing lines drawn in the finder to help you compose your picture . But it 's something to keep in mind . Years ago , when I was in Scotland , I bought a cheap dime-store camera and innocently snapped away at castles and landmarks , but when the prints came back , all I had were pictures of parking lots . I puzzled over these shots for a long time , wondering how I had come to take such silly pictures , until someone finally explained that though I was seeing castles through the viewfinder , the lens , which was lower on the camera , was seeing parked cars . Another disadvantage of most small-size rangefinders is that you ca n't change lenses , so both close-up and telephoto work is impossible ? though one small , compact camera of extremely high quality , the Leica CL , can have interchangeable lenses . For the most part , though , the mini cameras will take just about any scenic shot , near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record . Cameras such as the Rollei 35 , the Minox 35 ( which weighs a mere seven ounces ) , and the tiny Olympus are marvelous for backpackers , since they can fit into a pocket and hardly be felt . And other slightly bigger ones , like the Konica CS , which has a little flash built into the camera body , are great carry-alongs , especially if you are less concerned with high art and more with having an easy-to-bring , easy-to-use camera . Photography can be something of a tyrant ; I sometimes feel I spend so much travel time with my eye glued to a viewfinder that I have to wait till I get home to see what I saw . But it 's a wonderful activity , and a very happy accompaniment to good days ( and bad ones ) outdoors . Even a little 110 pocket camera , like those made by Kodak , Minolta , Minox , and others , can expand your pleasure , as 158 Wild , Wild Woman can one of the instants by Polaroid or Kodak , letting you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fish ? or falls off the dock ? to savor immediately and , later , for a lifetime . Besides photography , there are many other ways to spark up an otherwise dull outing , or to find a hobby that will lead you to a full enjoyment of the outdoors . Bird watching is especially popular and appealing ? not necessarily on the level of species gathering that many ardent birders enjoy , which involves adding sightings of as many different kinds of birds as possible to something called a " life list . " This can be fun and instructive , a kind of personal competition and incentive to expand experience ; but it can become obsessive , too , till the fact of seeing some rare specimen so it can be checked off the list becomes more important than actually looking at the bird . Not that there 's anything wrong with such a devotion ; it certainly gets a lot of people out and keeps them passionately interested in nature . But a less intense attitude tends to be more fun . In general , birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their variety and antics are endlessly interesting to observe . This is one reason why bird feeders and backyard ponds are so popular ; the comings and goings of feathered visitors can entertain you for hours , and you never know what to expect . Early one Saturday morning I was awakened by a phone call from a friend in Newburgh , New York , with the news that his father 's duck pond had a strange new tenant ? a golden crested crane from Africa . Heaven knows where this huge , exotic creature came from , but there it was , freeloading on corn thrown out for the more ordinary mallards that normally inhabit this small welfare state for water birds . Of course , birds can be seen almost anywhere , and there 's hardly a fishing , camping , hunting , hiking , boating , or any other kind of trip that could be counted a failure if bird life has enlivened the scene . Not long ago , on a slow day near the barrier islands off Virginia , we were so entertained by the skimmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gulls that we hardly had time to notice we were n't catching many fish . The high point of the day , in fact , was not the weakfish we finally landed , or the sharks we hooked , but an osprey that hovered over a sandy spit some distance off , then suddenly dropped out of sight , only to reappear moments later , flying low to the water with a fish so big in its claws that it could n't gain altitude . It struggled for a long way , trying to get its cumbersome burden And That 's Not All 159 airborne , then finally lost to aerodynamic reality . And in many a campsite , the lazy hours that might otherwise have seemed dull have been turned to comedy by the camp robbers ? bold jays that swoop down on any unguarded morsel of food , including entire pieces of bread , and whisk them away . Bird watching can be quite a sport even if you do n't know a robin from a hen , but it 's much more interesting if the individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their habits and history is known . Probably the most famous , and heavily used , reference works I or birders are the field guides by Roger Tory Peterson ( Houghton M ifflin Co. , Boston ) . A useful guide to bird watching , photography , and feeding , as well as to birds , is The Bird Watcher 's Bible , by George Laycock ( Doubleday , Garden City , N.Y. ) . This book also Includes a Life List for those who want to keep serious track of their watching . For watchers in search of birds , some of the most productive spots across the country are described in a book called Roger Tory Peterson 's Dozen Birding Hot Spots , by George H. Harrison ( Simon and Schuster , New York ) . These places , plus many unlisted National Wildlife Refuges , sometimes provide spectacular opportunities to see birds of most any feather , but just about anywhere you go is bound to turn up at least a little flight activity . Another time-honored outdoor enjoyment , though out of fashion for many years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can probably be credited with reviving this nearly forgotten sport , and his Stalking the Wild Asparagus and other delightful books on ting wild became best sellers . Unfortunately , the rush of enthusiasm to live off the land has had some tragic consequences , with unskilled pickers enlivening their meals with deadly side dishes . Just because a thing is natural does n't necessarily make it good . Lots of poisonous plants look a lot like edibles , and no one should eat a bowl of " wild salad " without being absolutely sure of what each leaf And stem in the mixture really is . It 's not enough to know the plants of the Adirondacks if you are picking things in the Sierras , either . Floras arc not always the same from one region to the next and the differences can be distressing . But with that caution , a little careful collecting of wild food can provide hours of fun , besides adding an interesting new dimension to a meal in camp or back home . Some growing things are almost unmistakable : dandelions , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woman they first appear in spring , and are a marvelous source of copper ; or fiddleheads , the new shoots of certain ferns that look like the tops of violins . Milkweed shoots are another popular and fairly easy-tolocate delicacy , and flour made from cattails is supposed to make terrific pancakes . Skunk cabbage also has its springtime devotees , but if you pick it after it 's past its early stages , you 'll be sorry , since skunk cabbage did n't get its name for nothing . For the super-careful , mushroom hunting offers a real adventure ? not just because of the consequences of a mistake , but because wild mushrooms ( especially morels ) are so highly prized for their delicious flavor . They tend to be hard to find , and enthusiasts can hardly wait for the mushroom season to begin . Since many of the choice varieties appear in the first soft weeks after winter , mushroom hunting in many places serves as a rite of spring , a heartfelt farewell to the long dead months and a joyous greeting of the rebirth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in search of edible treasure is a kind of reaffirmation of life ? provided you do n't pick the wrong mushrooms ! Armed with a good field guide to edible plants of the area you are harvesting , complete with good pictures , plus a great deal of caution , and maybe an expert friend along , the search for wild food can be an absorbing and rewarding outdoor pastime . There 's another , possibly safer though even more elusive natural bounty to be found in the great outdoors , and that is precious metals and jewels . The old Gold Rush days are gone forever , but gold panning remains a fascinating hobby . Like photography or bird watching or gathering , it can be done in conjunction with other outdoor activities , such as fishing or camping , or it can become a fulltime recreation on its own ( it can also become an obsession , I suppose , but that 's another story ) . Modern gold hunters washing gravel out of pans along the same rivers where the old-timers made their strikes are rekindling history as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to pay for the vacation ! Although chances of locating a nugget or even dust are pretty thin , the chances are there , and that ? along with being in wild country full of ghosts and legends of a colorful past ? is what makes it worth doing . Think of it : the odds against winning anything in a state lottery or sweepstakes are probably much higher than the odds against finding gold , yet millions are spent on the dream tickets every month . And That 's Not All 161 As long as you 're fantasizing riches , you might as well throw in some exercise and fresh air . There are a number of books to help the beginner get into the gold game : two useful ones are Summer Gold : A Camper 's Guide to Amateur Prospecting , by John N. Dwyer ( Charles Scribner 's Sons , New York ) and How and Where to Find Gold , by Verne Ballantyne ( Arco Publishing Co. , New York ) . These will give you equipment lists and instructions on panning , plus likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gold business ? as not just lone prospectors , but couples , too , sometimes do ? they may give you an idea of how to proceed . Another good sport with special appeal to romantics and those who dream of striking it rich ( a fair percentage of the population , I imagine ) is gem hunting . The idea of finding a diamond among the pebbles in a streambed feeding Lake Erie , a turquoise in the Arizona desert mountains , or a ruby in a North Carolina gem mine is a powerful incentive to get out of the house . In reality , there may be more food for the imagination than the jewel box in this activity , but it 's exciting to try . I once spent an afternoon sifting through dirt from a gem mine looking hopefully for the right color and shape that would mean a precious discovery . Nothing of value was there , but every glint of color was a pulse quickener , and even the worthless material I sifted out of the pile of rubble had a certain appeal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. T. Brown , a dynamic New York woman who is a vice-president of Hill &; Knowlton , a huge public relations company , was taken to a gem mine while vacationing in the Carolinas , and on her first day she found a ruby valued at $175 . By the end of five days she had a mayonnaise jar almost full of gemstones , including eight sizable rubies and twentyonc sapphires , some of which she says were " collector 's stones . " What 's more , she had found a lifelong enthusiasm that has kept her out and busy ever since . It even led her to write a hook , ( ; ems for the Taking ( Macmillan , New York ) in which she provides not only comprehensive where-and-how information , but . much fascinating gem lore as well . Finding a precious jewel in a pile of dirt is certainly an attractive idea . Add to it the intangible values of engaging in a nature-related , historically and geologically fascinating activity , and you 've struck it rich indeed . Such cerebral , sometimes sedentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of fulfillment , however . Some people can lie on their backs reading adventure stories in clouds and feel they 've done a good day 's work , but others need more excitement . For those , the relatively new ( to the U.S. ) sport of orienteering may be the thing . This activity , whether done for the fun of it or for the thrill of competitive victory , involves running a course through the woods , not along clearly marked paths , but by map and compass . Orienteering groups are springing up across the country , and the meets , something like sportscar rallies , draw enthusiastic crowds . The events are scaled for beginner , intermediate , and advanced , and you choose the category . Contestants are given a topographical map of the area , which they mark with the control points of the course they 'll be taking . After that , it 's up to them to plot a fast and accurate path to each of the control markers , where they perforate their entry card with the special punch found on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compass toward the next marker , and so on till they 've checked in at them all . The object is to punch in at each control point in the order prescribed by the course . Whoever crosses the finish line with the fastest time in each category wins . But anyone who simply completes the run with all points covered is considered a winner . Besides being a good , active , fresh-air sport that 's more fun than round-the-park jogging but potentially just as healthful , orienteering is also excellent training for people who enjoy roaming the great outdoors . For backpackers , hunters , fishermen , canoers , anyone who ventures off the established path or trail , a knowledge of map and compass use is essential . There are many books on the subject ? one of the classics is Bjorn Kjellstrom 's Be Expert With Map &; Compass ( Charles Scribner 's Sons , New York ) , which is something of a bible for orienteerers and back-country wanderers , first published in 1955 and recently enlarged and updated . Armed with this book , anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over unfamiliar country by interpreting the lines and squiggles on a contour map . But since meets give you a chance to try your skill at a premarked course , and also to be rescued if your map reading is not quite what it should be , this might be a better way to begin crosscountry navigation than just jogging off alone into the open spaces . ( For information on orienteering meets , write U.S. Orienteering Federation , Athens , Ohio 45701 , or American Orienteering Service , 308 West Fillmore , Colorado Springs , Colorado 80907 . ) And That 's Not All 163 Another active sport gaining popularity is the long-time favorite of a few , bicycle touring . Thanks to Bikecentennial ' 76 , formed by a group of biking enthusiasts before the big 200th year to encourage bike touring by establishing a 4,500-mile Trans-America Bicycle Trail linking back roads all across the U.S. , cyclers can now find their way across the entire country , or just part of it , passing through rural areas and seeing the U.S. as no traveler has seen it since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the safety of numbers , the organization also sponsored group rides led by experienced biker-campers . Thousands of people followed the trails , many of them in what you could call the bloom of youth ( bike touring has long been a popular sport with those who could appropriately fit into a Youth Hostel , where itinerant teenagers throughout the world have found shelter for many years ) . But on the Bikecentennial group rides , folks of all ages signed up for the adventure . Not everyone who jumps on the cross-country bike trail is ready for it , of course ; one Bikecentennial group leader from the West told me that several women who signed up for his ride had thought that it would be a good way to lose weight . But such strenuous activity demands considerable food intake to keep energy flowing , so dieting was out of the question ? and so was slimming down . Since they were not prepared for the hard work without some tangible reward , the overweight travelers soon dropped out . But a great many men , women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open-air tour tremendously . In some ways , bike camping is like backpacking ; though your gear is not carried on you but in bags on your bike ( the equipment revolution in biking has been almost as awesome as it 's been in backpacking ) , you 're the driving power just the same . So remember to travel light . One big difference between the two activities , however , is that on a bike , you 're traveling on roads , and roads go through towns , which means the possibility of iced drinks and fresh food for dinner . Cross-country biking is a very active activity , but it 's just as much a sport for families as for youths full of adolescent vigor . F he summer before the Bicentennial , Glenda Wilhelm , a West Coast writer and teacher , rode from California to Washington , D . C. , with her husband Tim and their two children , aged 91/1 and 2 ? . During the course of their journey , the family crossed deserts , climbed Wild , Wild Woman ins , passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the crowded East . In an article she wrote for the 75 Field &; Stream , Glenda described the trip in a way that t seem irresistible , despite the pain and problems she ered . Because they were riding in the open , out of the usual people travel in , they could see every mile of the countryside sed through , and they could meet people on the way . Some a were unfriendly or suspicious of this caravan , but many are fascinated and friendly , some even inviting them to share me for a night . And in case you 're wondering how a 2i/2-yeard could take such a long , physical trip , he rode behind his s bike in a rickshawlike carrier in true pasha style . His sister , /2 , biked the ordinary way . ) ugh the year of the Bikecentennial is over , its spirit lingers maps and information are available from the organization at x 1034 , Missoula , Montana . For less-ambitious biking , many cities , and states have created bikeways for the pleasure and f cyclers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Oregon , Las well-marked lanes , trails , and even paths next to major /s where bicyclists can ride along .

It can be a blessing , and sometimes a curse . But like it or there , and it 's full of glories . Sooner or later , even the coziest the best movie , or the most magnificent shopping center s confining and dull , and it 's time to step through the walls , o some place green and growing . All we need is a goal to bring For many , fishing , hunting , camping , hiking , boating , skiing , h sports supply the incentive to pick up and go . For those who joy traditional outdoor activities , the outdoors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's just a matter of the right yellow brick road . " Do n't worry about me , I never get a sunburn . " ? famous last words . " Whoever invented the Bermuda short was an enemy of the human figure . " - EDWIN NEWMAN , NBC-TV . One of the worst barriers standing between many modern women and an enjoyment of the unpaved world is the idea that good looks and nature do not mix . It 's as if they perceive the outdoors as a place guarded by large doors bearing the inscription , " Abandon attractiveness , comfort , and femininity , all ye who enter here . " This is a false impression . Although evening gowns , high-heeled shoes , three-inch fingernails , and Marie Antoinette hair styles would generally be out of place on a fishing boat or a picnic in the woods , there 's no reason other than personal preference for anyone , woman or man , to look like Andy Devine after three months in a chuck wagon just because he or she is taking a day or ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearances in settings more rugged than a tennis court or the neighbor 's pool is not a frivolous or effete preoccupation .

Concern about skin , hair , clothing , and the other ingredients of good looks is not unreasonable . Since few of us will end up living in the wilderness , far from the vanities of civilization , it 's only natural to wish that a visit to the woods will not damage the image we must sooner or later take back home . Anyway , what 's wrong with a little vanity ? Vanity is destructive only when it occupies all effort , time , and thought , leaving no room for the soul . Of great importance for good looks is skin . Despite the plethora of creams and esoteric potions sold to women , and recently developed specifically for men , skin is the par ' : of our bodies we take most for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large percentage of 166 Looking Good 167 the human body consists of this outer covering . By itself , the average person 's skin weighs between seven and ten pounds , and stretched out would take up about twenty square feet . It 's our protective cover , the barrier between our vital innards and the outside world . It takes the brunt of everything ? sun , wind , water , heat , dust , dirt , salt spray , smog , poisonous air , and whatever else we have flung at us from the skies . Of all these menaces to the skin , sun is the most dangerous . It 's also the most fun , which is why it 's a matter of real concern . Nothing seems to lift the spirits more than a nice , healthy tan , and laid end to end , the dollars spent by pale-faced people acquiring a golden glow would probably extend to Mars and back . By the same token , little short of death can ruin an outing faster than a serious , bright-red burn . What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer , wrinkles , permanent discoloration , blotching , rashes , thickening , and premature appearance of old age . I know several people who were provided with far more money than was good for them , and who used this money primarily to follow the sun from Fire Island to Tahiti . The years of almost continual tanning have actually added twenty years to their apparent age . Their skin is dark , but it 's not pretty . In fact , their hides have taken on a marked resemblance to that other one-time badge of affluence , the alligator bag . This is a dire warning : once the sun damage is done it can not be remedied . No amount of face-lifting or chemical scraping can really undo the leather look of a too-tanned skin . So prevention is worth any number of pounds of cure ; more accurately , no amount of cure can substitute for preventive measures . But since the outdoors is filled with sun , at least on its better days , how can overexposure be avoided ? The best way is to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tree or a boat canopy or a beach umbrella , reflected light can burn the skin . Obviously , shade is not always available . A day in a fishing boat , a hike in the desert or on a beach , an afternoon at the skeet range , even a nature walk in a meadow may require hours of unrelieved exposure to the sun . Preventing a burn or other damage to the skin in these situations requires some forethought , and a lot of common sense . First of all , if there 's no shade available , you must bring your own along . This means carrying a wide-brimmed hat ( preferably one that fits tightly enough so it wo n't blow away , or that can he tied on under 168 Wild , Wild Woman the chin ) , a long-sleeved shirt or lightweight jacket with a collar that can be turned up to protect the neck , a pair of long pants , and socks as well as shoes . In particularly strong sun , I also recommend carrying a pair of lightweight white cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing to take along on a fine summer day , but for any morning-to-evening stretch under a cloudless , sunlit sky , it 's small enough insurance against future pain . I learned to add the socks and gloves the hard way , during a bonefishing trip in the Bahamas . Out on the measureless white-sand flats , where the water is as clear as the air and the sun comes at you from all directions , there 's no refuge except inside whatever shell you yourself can provide . I had covering for my arms , legs , and head , but for my ankles and wrists I had no protection , so I ended up with red socks and red mittens , courtesy of the Bahamian sun . The next day I wore regulation socks on my feet and , because I had no real gloves , on my hands as well . This may have looked strange , and it certainly made handling the fishing rod more difficult than usual , but it kept me feeling good . I am not suggesting that every step outdoors must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the pleasure of any sunny season . But too many people set off in the morning for a day on the water dressed only in a bikini or a pair of shorts and a sleeveless shirt , and return in the evening red as a lobster , wretchedly burned and sick with fever and chills , bitter at outdoor life , and vowing never again to go fishing or whatever it was that did them in . A little carepackage of clothes to be opened in case of need would not only have saved that day , but a lot of days to come . The other essential ingredient in outdoor skin care is some kind of lotion or oil designed to help ward off the sun . There are a number of these available in any drugstore , promising deep tans and smooth skin . Many are of no use when it comes to protecting the skin from too much sun . The only products of any real value under serious exposure conditions are those containing a sunscreen . According to dermatologists , the most effective screen is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is found in several products . Other effective agents are the benzophenones , found in Solbar and Uval , for example . I tend to develop a rash from too much exposure to PABA , so I save it for extreme need and rely generally on Coppertone 's Shade , plus plenty of real shade and coverings . Since Looking Good 169 my forehead , nose , and cheekbones are especially susceptible to flame-up , I double cover these areas with Coppertone 's Nosekote . This is probably not as foolproof as the old favorite , zinc oxide , but at least it does n't give you the look of a clown in partial white-face . Other sun-blocking agents include Afil and Maxafil . For my lips , I use lipstick in a red or coral color , since pink shades do not block out the sun . Men , and women who shun lipstick , should use a lip protector , but be sure it has a sunscreen , since many products have cocoa butter as the main ingredient , which does not really provide protection from the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exposure , and nothing looks or feels worse than a mouth that has been burned , dried , and cracked by the elements . So far , I 've had excellent results with my precautionary measures ? when I remember to put them on . For all my lecturing , I often do n't follow my own advice , and still suffer red-faced embarrassment for my forgetfulness or foolish assumption that there 's not enough sun out to burn . The dumbest example in recent times occurred on an overcast morning at Cannon Beach in Oregon , while I was photographing the imaginative sculptures created during the town 's annual Sand Castle Festival . I was using Kodachrome 25 , a film that requires a lot of light for proper exposure , and my camera should have told me that this was one of the brighter days , visible sun or not . It did n't ? or rather , it did , and I did n't listen . So my face turned red , and later fell off . Not very smart . If , in spite of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a burn , there are some things you can do to relieve the pain , even far from home . A simple and effective remedy is to dissolve a teaspoonful of table salt in a quart of cool water and soak the affected area for one or two minutes three or four times a day , allowing it to dry between soakings . This helps prevent infection , keeps the area clean , and will cause the blisters to dry out over a shorter period of time . Another possible soother , especially if you 're somewhere with little water available , is wet , cool tea leaves ( tannic acid being an old-time remedy for burns ) . At home , comfort for a mild overdose of sun may be found in a cool bath laced with baking soda . One of the best natural remedies is the juice of the aloe plant . This is used commonly in the Bahamas ( do n't forget , black skin , especially it it has not been exposed to the sun fora while , is also susceptible to burning , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the less danger he or she will 170 Wild , Wild Woman be in ) . Aloe is also reported to be an excellent sun screen and is an ingredient in several products designed to protect the skin from the sun . It can also be grown in a flower pot for home relief . That old favorite Noxema is another big help in relieving sunburn pain , and there are several medicated sprays for burns , although if the condition is really bad , these sprays can sometimes add a secondary burn of their own . If there 's any swelling or blistering , do n't fool around with home remedies , but get to a doctor right away . Sunburn can be serious as well as miserable . For this reason , wilderness travelers who are leaving civilization for more than a day should be doubly careful not to get too much sun . Five miles from help can be a long way when those miles are measured on mountain trails . Except for the lucky ones descended directly from Helen of Troy and various Greek gods , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their skin . Almost every woman over twenty ? and if the cosmetic industry is right , lots of men as well ? has worked out a regime for holding back the inevitable inroads of time . But outdoor people have extra problems . Besides sun , their skin receives regular overdoses of wind , salt spray , cold , perspiration , dry air , pollution , and plain old dirt . Of course , everyone who is n't locked in the attic gets the same treatment , but it 's a matter of degree : there 's a world of difference between a five-second walk from the backdoor to the garage in a high wind and a five-hour ride on an open boat in a gale . This does n't mean that people who wish to keep their outdoorsy look down to a modest glow need to stick to sheltered ways , but it does mean that they have to take some special care . Such watchfulness is not as difficult as it might seem . In fact , it hardly requires any more time than a normal indoor person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person is someone like Zsa Zsa Gabor , it may take a great deal less . Anyway , here 's an easy regime recommended by one of the grooming consultants at Eastern Airlines , where looking good is part of the job : 1 . Wash your face thoroughly after any outing , as well as morning and night . Dirt is everywhere , especially in the outdoors , and being out does not mean that you ca n't wash your face . Non-alkaline cleansing bars , such as Lowella or Neutrogena , are best for the skin , though you have to be careful of the latter away from home , as it will melt if exposed to heat or sun . In the wilderness , the cleanser should Looking Good 171 be biodegradable . After washing , rinse thoroughly . If you do wash with soap , which is likely to be alkaline , you may remove the acid mantel that protects skin from invasion by bacteria . This is where Step 2 comes in. 2 . Wipe your face with a skin refresher that will restore the normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do this is to squeeze the juice of half a lemon into a bottle of witch hazel . This has no odor , so it wo n't act as a magnate for insects . Kept cool in a refrigerator or ice chest , it also provides a refreshing pick-me-up after one of those hot , sweaty days when you feel more like Father Time than Mother Nature . Witch hazel is very drying , however , so many people may prefer to use Sebanil packets or Cetaphil lotion as an astringent. 3 . Put on a moisturizer after you 've cleaned your face . This does n't have to be a big deal , although it 's certainly possible to spend the rent money on special creams , even in a discount drugstore . Any mild lotion that feels like a light lubricant when rubbed between the fingers will do . Neutraderm or other mild , unscented type lotions are good . In hot weather , creams and oils can block the pores , causing blackheads or worse , so avoid anything that feels heavy or greasy , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun-screen products also contain moisturizers , these can be used on a regular basis , just to make sure . Whatever you use , apply it till your skin wo n't absorb any more . And put it on after every washing , while your skin is still damp , no matter where you are . A container of moisturizing cream is easy enough to carry on camping trips , and for backpacking , go-light purists , there are scaled-down products , small bottles that can take a portion from a bigger size , or sample sizes of standard brands , which can often be found in large drug departments . 4 . Lubricate your hands . Hands get more of everything , from sun to dishwater , and need special help to keep them from turning into lizard claws . Neutrogena , which makes a lot of very gentle , nonscented products for the skin , has been offering a tiny sample tube of hand-care cream that can easily fit in a pocket , and there are a number of good creams in plastic bottles or tubes that can travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun screen on hands and wrists , too . This is an area that 's all too easy to forget - and all too obvious when you do . 172 Wild , Wild Woman 5 . Do n't ignore the rest of that seven pounds of skin . Our outer layer is made up mainly of water , protein , and mineral salts , and a lot of heavy sweating such as accompanies an active day outdoors can leach some of these elements away . Here 's where the milk bath of love-goddess fame comes in . This does n't mean a decadent soak in a tubful of liquid that should have gone to the school-lunch program . A simple handful of dried milk thrown into a tub of water along with a little mineral oil will help restore the lost skin ingredients to the body and leave you smoother and relatively free of the itches that beset a person with dried-out , untreated skin . If this seems too grossly sybaritic , just soak in some bath gel or oil or beads now and then , especially after a hard few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods . The outdoors is great , but it can feel good to go home again , too . That 's all there is to it . A few minutes a few times a day . It 's not breaking some commandment of nature to keep your skin in shape in- or outdoors . Two small bottles of lotions are not too much to carry into the wilderness , or on any kind of outdoor trip . Neither is a mirror ( metal for the backwoods ) , although some people feel this has no place on an excursion into nature , where everything should be allowed to hang out in its natural old way . ( Usually people who say this have adorable faces with skin like peaches , bee-stung lips , and hair that never needs combing . ) For women who need cosmetics to face the world with confidence and a smile , a small makeup kit is n't too much to carry , either . Just do n't overdo it . An eyebrow pencil , a stick of eye shadow , and a lipstick should be enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along with a small brush or comb and a nail file for clearing away the dirt that has a way of collecting under nails in the outdoors , into a small plastic bag and tuck it into your pocket or someplace where it will be easily accessible . Out in the woods and on the water , it feels good to leave the powder and liquid makeup at home , but anyone who feels naked without it should put it on . Some makeups include a sun screen in their formula ( Estee Lauder , for example , or Texas Pharmacy 's Reflecta , and Physician 's Formula ) and so could be worn with a practical excuse , though they wo n't provide enough protection for Looking Good 173 prolonged exposure . As far as I 'm concerned , however , if you want to wear full makeup , no excuse is necessary . Whatever makes a person feel good is all right , as long as it does n't make a mess of the woods or impinge on other people 's time and fun . Any rigid rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area of life . Next to skin , the most important element in good looks is hair , which is subject to the same natural disasters as the rest of the body 's outer layer , and can get into some awful snarls without a little extra care . Again , this need n't take up any time . Here are a few tips from the hair specialists at Procter and Gamble that may help keep the crowning glory in hand no matter where you go : 1 . Get a good haircut that can be cared for at home , preferably one that does n't require curlers , salon driers , and fancy comb-outs to look " done . " This is easiest for people with curly or slightly wavy hair , or hair that hangs thick and straight from the scalp line . A good stylist , however , can usually give a maintenance-free cut to anyone . Such hair styles can go fearlessly into the winds and the rains and return almost unscathed , so a stretch of time out of beauty-parlor range is no disaster . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and certainly the natural look is easiest on life , indoors or out . But women who feel frumpish without a beehive or bouffant or upswept curls should go with their inner image , as long as the hairdo does n't dominate and dictate life in general , or prevent an enjoyment of the outdoors . 2 . Wash your hair as often as you like , every day if you want to , providing you use a shampoo that 's gentle enough for this treatment . Special fruit flavors and essences are not necessary ; in fact , they may be tough to rinse out and leave a dulling film on the hair . Actually , regular washing is no harder on the hair than an accumulation of sweat , oil , dust , air-pollution fallout , and hairspray . Besides , nothing is more refreshing after an active day than a clean , wet head . 3 . After washing , use a conditioner , especially if the hair has been subjected to a lot of sun and wind . A rinse wo n't do , since it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is L'Oreal 's Amalgan , which is used right after washing and only takes a minute . People with color-treated hair especially need to use conditioner regularly or their golden heads will turn to straw . Remember , sun , salt air , and all those other outdoorsy 174 Wild , Wild Woman things really parch the hair , and the shine needs to be put back in. 4 . After washing , handle with care . Never pull a brush through wet hair , which is extra-fragile . Use a wide-toothed comb . 5 . If possible , especially in the summer , air-dry your hair , giving it a rest from hair dryers , blow dryers , hot curlers , and curling irons . 6 . Do n't bake your head in the sun or soak it in saltwater or chlorine . When you 're out in the sun , cover your hair with a hat or a scarf , at least if you 're going to be out for hours . And if you swim without a bathing cap , wash the saltwater ( or pool ) out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat in winter , lift it with both hands ? do n't pull . The same static electricity that makes nylon cling to your skin like a wet suit makes your hair stand on end and crackle , and rough treatment will break the ends . Winter is especially hard on hair , subjecting it to alternate steambaths inside hats and desert dryness in central heating . So give your head the same respect you do ( or should ) in summer ? and then some . Although on an outdoor excursion of more than a day 's duration hair can turn into a real disaster , it 's obviously not always convenient to wash and condition and all the rest . Sometimes ( using biodegradable soap , of course ) it 's possible to get a wonderful natural bath , reminiscent of the Clairol Herbal Essence commerical on TV . But no kind of back-country washing should take place in any body of water except a really large river , so mostly you 'll just have to go with the wind . It was for such occasions that scarves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has demonstrated to the world that dozens of cute things can be done with simple squares of cloth , so there 's no need to walk around with a babushka tied under the chin , old granny style , either . The hair may be a sweaty , dusty , icky mess , but if it 's hidden beneath a chic exterior , who cares ? Clothing is the last ? or almost the last ? element in the good-looks package . Here men of the sporting world have always had an edge , even over their more stodgy indoor counterparts . Tweedy shooting jackets , riding clothes , handsome wool shirts and sweaters , and other garments specially designed for outdoor activities are staples of many best-dressed closets . Women , however , have n't been so lucky . As I mentioned earlier , very little in the way of clothing designed for the great outdoors is made with the female figure in mind . This does n't Looking Good 175 have to be a great obstacle to looking good , though . Luckily , those once-prevalent women 's slacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hips , and nipped in at the ankle , making even Marilyn Monroe look like a chicken dumpling , have all but disappeared from the scene . Now we have jeans , which practically everyone looks good in , even relatively fat people . Women 's sizes may be difficult to locate , but most women can find an equivalent in the men 's department . The waist will be big if the hips fit , because men go straight up and down and women do n't , but that can be fixed . Shorts are another matter . Walking shorts are popular and practical for hiking in warm weather , and attractive tailored models are seen on backpackers across the country . But there 's hardly a man or woman alive who looks attractive in Bermuda shorts , Jamaicas , or pedal pushers . Anyone who truly wants to be a knockout in the woods wo n't wear these garments . This is the only categorical statement on style that I will make in this book . There are many stylish garments that women can pick up in men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small ) that will do perfectly for most outdoor activities , except those that call for special equipment . I have some much-loved long-sleeved shirts , sort of ersatz safari style , and a few.woodsy wool jacket shirts that are comfortable and nicelooking , if not particularly feminine . Down jackets are readily available in sporting-goods stores , and although they make the wearer look like a large worm , they 're also sold in fancy department stores which sell them as fashion wear . Wool slacks are the best bet for winter , but they may be hard to get , partly because wool is itchy and no one wants to wear it . Well-tailored wool-Dacron mixes are available in fashionable stores , however , as are attractive pants in other materials , some suitable for rugged wear . In the **27;217;TOOLONG line there may not be too much selection , but as the number of females taking up these and other traditional outdoor sports increases , manufacturers will undoubtedly respond with made-for-women designs . It would be nice to have a greater selection of garments made specifically for outdoor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I hope the day never comes when the element of improvisation departs from the backwoods " fashion " scene . Spot is such as fishing , hiking , camping , canoeing , hunting , and all the rest of the activities I have touched on in this book are essentially individual pastimes , and 176 Wild , Wild Woman they should n't be burdened with uniforms , structures , and other purist notions . Function is vital , but the form should be allowed to follow its own way . Tennis might once have been a game people played in gum-sole shoes and whatever comfortable old clothing they did n't mind getting sweated up , but today it 's Big Business , with snobbery , costumes , and a trendy appeal that have turned it into more of a social phenomenon than a game . The same thing happened with downhill skiing , and may be happening with cross-country . The high falutin ' shootin ' world has always been afflicted with a certain tweedy concern with proper dress , though this never spread to the level of a Walton-family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being infected by the rigors of style , with the jumpsuit having taken a certain hold , but otherwise , the great outdoors is one of the last refuges in the sporting world of the old-shoe manner of dress . I repeat , this does n't have to mean bib overalls or some hairy lumberjack look ( though there 's no reason why it should n't ) . But it does give people a real , and somewhat rare , freedom simply to be themselves . I once heard of a woman who arrived at a campsite on the ' Green River in Utah via raft , dressed in white high-heeled shoes , a simple shift , and a little white sweater , apparently quite unruffled by the fact that she had just spent several hours shooting rapids . Such an outfit can hardly be recommended for river wear , but who except a spoilsport would deny her the right to dress as she pleased , as long as she did n't blame someone else if she got her outfit wet ? People tend to place too much emphasis on costume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're supposed to be having fun , it seems especially silly . Anyway , no matter what sport you go for , clothes do n't guarantee success . I can prove this statement . Inside my lucky Yamaha T-shirt and dime-store sneakers there 's a soul that knows the thrill of victory . But not even Adidas footwear and Halston sweat suits could rescue the body from the agony of defeat . Even so , good looks , and the confidence they provide , do matter . So does the one last element , which is probably the real key to looking good ? vitality . People who are healthy , happy , full of interests , who can find excitement in small moments and fulfillment in unstructured days , will have an attractiveness that goes beyond fashion or style or even Hollywood-starlet good looks . Too many of us today are bored , and no amount of costuming can cover it up . Looking Good 177 The outdoors has a lot to offer in this regard . It 's full of possibilities for spontaneity and adventure ? riding rapids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eagle ride the thermals in search of prey , feeling the night take over the world . It 's full of physical exertion , too ? the kind that not only tightens muscles , improves health , and melts off pounds , but is actually fun . It has unexpected moments of pleasure , and of fear . It forces you to think and to cope . If you let it , it can even rescue a mind gone slightly stale from too many hours in the clutches of TV . Cosmetic counters are full of magic potions that promise to revitalize the complexion by covering wrinkles and sluffing off dead skin . The great outdoors can work a similar miracle ? only it does its job on chubby thighs , tired blood , and boredom-bogged brains . " Nature 's laws affirm instead of prohibiting . If you violate her laws you are your own prosecuting attorney , judge , jury , and hangman . " ? LUTHER BURBANK . " If you go long enough without a bath , even the fleas will let you alone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Much as I love the outdoors , I 'll be the first to admit that it 's full of miseries . This is only fitting . Where would your famous balance of nature be without a few rank and gross things to counterpoint the glorious sunsets , fresh fish dinners , and fine spring days ? Unfortunately , our earthly paradise , or those parts of it that have managed to survive since the Fall of Man , is crawling with nuisances . Chief among the natural outdoor tormentors are the insects that like to dine on human beings , and those that administer a sting if bothered ? and sometimes even if not . Close on the heels of these animate discomforters are the plants that can turn flesh into fire with a simple touch . Temperature is another enemy of good feelings , as well as good health . So are altitude , wetness , unfamiliar food and water , and our old friendly enemy , the sun . There 's no way to avoid these undesirable elements except to stay indoors at all times , fully protected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precautions may save you from all but the occasional crafty mosquito that manages to slip under the door with the groceries , but they will also save you from the smell of the ocean , and the sight of a full moon rising in a desert sky , which is far too great a price to pay for total comfort . Some irritation is inevitable , but with a little strategy it 's possible to avoid many of the booby traps set by nature , and to minimize the dirty tricks you ca n't escape . The biters . Although it 's pleasant to believe that everything must have been put on earth to serve a special purpose , it 's hard to recognize the good that such beings as mosquitoes , black flies , greenhead flies , gnats , no-see-urns , and the like can contribute to the great chain of being . Nothing with blood in it is safe from these 180
