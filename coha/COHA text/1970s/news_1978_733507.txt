txt WAYMAN PRESLEY never knew much about the world that lay beyond the hills of southern Illinois . But , by gosh , he knew those hills . He was raised in them . As a child L2. played in them . The ravines and bluffs and river banks were his playground , the racoons and squirrels and rabbits his playmates . He 's lived in them all his life . Raised his own in them . Worked in them . For years he traversed them -- criss  --  crossing them day after day in his beat-up old car as he worked his rural mail route . " EVERYONE AROUND Makanda , knew Wayman  --  the rural mail carrier . It got so they could set their watches by him as he made his way delivering mail . They knew Wayman for being on time . But people also knew Wayman for the tours he gave  --  pleasant excursions on Saturdays into the hills with Wayman showing people the 52 kinds of orchids that grow there . And pointing out the different trees and listening for the bird calls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a new day . " Close-up With Anne Keegan By the time Wayman was getting ready to retire , he had quite a following . " I 'D BEEN taking people into the hills for years , " he said . " I did it for free ? it was for the fun of it . I was planning to retire soon . I was going to fish the rivers and sell the fish for a little extra income . I had all the nets and everything . I figured I could make $50 on a good day . " But then one afternoon I had a bunch of people sitting along a river bank at the end of a tour up in the hills . They had had such a nice time they said , ' Well , Wayman , where are you going to take us next ? ' " I said ' Well , I do n't rightly know . ' " And they said , ' Next summer , take us to see the ocean . ' " I THOUGHT , I 've never been out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I went down to Florida to scout it out . Here I was a country boy from a town of 150 people looking at that long line of Miami Beach hotels . " I sat down on the end of a pier , and I thought , how is a country boy going to outwit these city sharpies so my people can come and stay cheap ? " So I went to the last hotel in the line  --  the cheapest  --  and I bargained for rooms . I got the man to give me a price of $4.50 a night . ' Then I went to the next cheapest hotel and told the manager that the ether hotel would give me the beds for $4.50 a night . He agreed so I went to the next one and then the next one working up the line until I got to the triple A hotels and still got the $4.50 a bed price . " I ORGANIZED the tour and everyone loved it . And at the end , they asked me again , ' Well , Wayman , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want // A hill country boy discovers the world // ed to go to New York . Others wanted to go to California . " Soon as I got back from that trip ? I retired . But I did n't go fishing . I started planning those two trips . I was 62 back then and all I had was $1,100 in the bank . " The two tours the next summer  --  to New York and California  --  were so successful that I made $3,000 . That 's when I decided to go into the tour business . " I 'd been operating out of the spare bedroom in the house , and when my papers overflowed into our living room , my wife told me to move my little business out . So I built a little office in the back yard and I worked from there . " I GOT TO be known fern-wide. you might say . People from little towns who had never been much of anywhere were Tribune Photo by Luigi Mendicino Wayman Presley : " I never had as much fun or enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for the tours . They passed the word and my business grew . I took them by bus to Alaska . I took them to Mexico , Africa , Europe . I chartered a paddle wheel boat to travel the Mississippi . I had tours to the Caribbean . " In the last 18 years , Wayman Presley 's retirement business has grown . Last year , 17,000 people went on 300 Presley , tours . " When I applied to be an agent for the international airlines a man came down from Canada to see me. lie drove into Makanda and looked around and thought , I guess , ' Hells , bells , nobody here could buy a ticket much less sell one . ' - The people in town directed him to Close-up my house . and he walked in shaking his head . and he never sat down . He just said , ' Mr. Presley , I do n't think you understand the tour business . " ' YOU 'VE GOT to be in a big city . With a big office and big displays . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't operate out of a little town like this . ' Then he turned around and left . " I took all the yellow pages from the southern Illinois phone books and sent it to his office and said call anyone in there you like and ask them if . they know about my tours . In four days , I got the go ahead to sell . " Now people from Air-India , Air France , Lufthansa came to our little town and shake their heads in wonder because we outsell some of the big city offices . " Wayman Presley is now 81 years old and touring around the world . As an old county bey ? who should be sitting back in a rocker ? he 's doing all right . He discovered the world as a senior citizen . And , he says , he has no plans to quit discovering now . " I NEVER HAD as much fun or enjoyed myself until I got to be old , " he said . " I just wish I 'd goiter old sooner . " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-room house , he 's been able to be generous in their old age . On their 50th anniversary three years ago , he built her a new brick house and bought her a gold Cadillac . The tour business has made him a wealthy man . And a healthy one too . " I feel as good today as I did when I fA'as 20 , " he said . " You know why ? ' Cause I got so many things to think about . I do n't think about this old body 1w got , " I was an old man when I first got out of these woods . I never knew when I retired I 'd be starting a whole other life and that it would last so long . " WHAT HAPPENED to me in my old age sort of reminds me what can happen sometimes to the trees up in the hills . " You got the ones at the bottom of a hill they grow fast and fat and tall . Then up above ? all alone on some rocky crevice ? you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's short and small , but the wood is hard . " The tall big ones at the bottom ? they 'll catch your eye , and they 'll get cut down to make planks for a mule barn . But the little one on the crevice that takes so long to grow ? it 's wood is hard and tough . That 's the one they make fiddles out of . That 's the one that makes music/ for Ma world .
