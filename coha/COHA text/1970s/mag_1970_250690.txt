While patriots of left and right debate the question of who owns the American flag , the law has the ticklish task of providing workable answers . Take the case of Stephen Haugh , 23 , a Pennsylvania State University student who joined a campus antiwar demonstration on July 4 , 1967 . Haugh brandished an American flag emblazoned with the slogans " Make Love Not War " and " The New American Revolutionaries . " He was convicted of violating a 1939 state law that makes it a misdemeanor to write " any word " on the flag or " publicly cast contempt " upon it . <P> Haugh appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court on the ground that flag-desecration laws restrain a demonstrator 's free speech and are thus unconstitutional . The court avoided that issue , which civil libertarians are now attempting to bring before the Supreme Court . Even so , the Pennsylvania tribunal has just reversed Haugh 's conviction . <P> As it turns out , the Pennsylvania flag law contains a little-noticed clause that exempts any " political demonstration or decorations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruled that flag desecration is legal in Pennsylvania if it " takes place at a political demonstration . " The state legislature may not define " political " to exclude protest groups , the court suggested ; as a result . Old Glory can be used as anyone 's political prop in Pennsylvania .
