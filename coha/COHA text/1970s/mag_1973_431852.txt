 | The Ordeal of Kevin and Jean Jones I n a New York City courtroom , a clerk bawls out , " Jean and Kevin Jones , fugitives from justice in the state of Kansas . " A scared young couple rises , hands tightly clasped . Jean Jones , 23 , is a pretty blonde with sad hazel eyes ; her husband , Kevin , 27 , pale , earnest , wearing gold-rimmed glasses . They hardly look like fugitives . Yet the two have been charged in Kansas with kidnapping , a crime punishable by imprisonment for life . The alleged victim is their own fouryear-old daughter ; the complainant , John Franklin Jones , Kevin 's father . A soap opera ? It sounds like one , but it is all too tragically true . Like a soap opera , there are scenes of sheer melodrama : a frightened 17-year-old too ashamed to tell her parents that she is pregnant ; a young couple signing a paper and losing their baby ; the child 's mysterious disappearance in Mexico ; a son charging his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his son . The drama , which has already ranged over three states and involved the Governors of two , is still unfolding . The most recent scene was played in December , as Jean and Kevin Jones fought extradition in the New York courts . Eventually ? and probably soon ? the locale will shift to Kansas , where the young couple must face the kidnapping charges or lose their daughter forever . No matter how the story ends , five protagonists already bear emotional scars which can never be erased . To win their granddaughter , John Jones , 61 , and his wife , Virginia , have disowned their two sons and cut themselves off from three other grandchildren . Jean and Kevin 's lives have been blighted ; they wait in a no-man'sland of uncertainty and despair . The youngest victim is their daughter ; she loves her continued on page 148 @#  | parents and she loves her grandparents , and does not understand why they must war over her . The tale of three generations of the Jones family is not merely a sensational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a modern American tragedy , to be pondered by all parents uneasy over their children 's long hair and new sex morality ; by all children rebellious of parental values . For if father and son had been able to talk honestly and with mutual respect for the other 's life-style , misunderstanding might not have led to battle , and battle to vengeance , and vengeance to the destruction of the entire fabric of the family . The story starts six years ago when Kevin Jones , home on vacation from college , met Jean Louise Labbe , a high school senior , in Wilmette , Ill. , the wealthy Chicago suburb in which both lived . A wild youngster , Kevin was a worry to his parents . He was suspended from college for bringing a girl to his room , and was twice arrested for drunken driving . In retrospect , these now seem to have been fraternity-boy escapades , which ended once he met Jean . ( " I have n't even gotten a traffic ticket in six years , " Kevin says today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is five inches shorter than his son , remembers ; he has kept a file on each of the incidents . Unlike the Joneses , Jean 's parents , Leon and Ernestine Labbe , were not affluent ( her father was a telephone operator with the Wilmette police force ; her mother , an insurance clerk ) , but there was deep religious conviction and trust and love in their home . " I was brought up as a good Christian girl , " Jean says . " We were all very close . " At Kevin 's house , she could feel no love . There she always felt uncomfortably like the policeman 's daughter from the other side of the tracks . Jean and Kevin had been dating steadily for almost a year ? " I guess I loved him from day one , " Jean says ? when she discovered she was pregnant . Kevin 's behavior in this crisis belied his reputation for irresponsibility . He promptly flew home from the University of Maryland , to decide with Jean what to do . Shc flatly refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick about her older brother , serving in Vietnam . " I just could n't break their hearts . " The solution the two frightened youngsters hit on was not unusual : Jean would join Kevin in Maryland , have her baby secretly , and find a loving couple to adopt it . But one night on the long-distance phone , Kevin blurted out the truth to his father , and John Jones had different ideas . The young couple should marry , he said , even if they divorced later ; he would foot all the bills . " No , " Kevin answered . Well , if they intended to give up the child , why not let the grandparents adopt it ? Again , " no . " " I was n't ready to settle down and bring up a child , " Kevin explains . " I just was n't anywhere near ready . " Jean understood . " Kevin had a lot of growing up to do still , and so did I. Getting married for the baby 's sake was n't the answer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple 's opinion . " I told my father they were too old , " Kevin says . He was also concerned about his mother 's health ; Virginia Jones has suffered several strokes . Kevin was not unkind enough to add the main reason : a growing doubt about how lovingly his parents had raised him . On April 8 , 1968 , in Prince George 's General Hospital in Maryland , Jean @# bore a baby girl whom they named Lisa . It was not a joyous time . The two went home empty-handed , leaving the infant in the care of the PeirceWarwick Adoption Service of Washington , D.C. Jean and Kevin had chosen the agency carefully . " We did a lot of checking to be sure she would n't end up in an orphanage somewhere , " Jean says . Allowed to visit and hold the baby briefly a few weeks later , Jean says , " I felt really low . It was horrible to have her and not be able to be her mother . Kevin felt pretty bad , too , but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , that something was wrong with tiny Lisa . The infant had a red ridge a half inch wide , apparently a birthmark , running across her scalp . When she was four weeks old , agency workers told Jean and Kevin there was a chance that she might become retarded within six to nine months . They promised to call in a specialist to take X-rays , but the next day a social worker telephoned . " Come get your baby , " she said . " She is not a proper subject for adoption . " " Did the specialist see her ? " Kevin asked . No , he was told . The two were in a panic . Kevin was studying for final exams ; Jean was jobhunting ; and they had no money for medical expenses . Kevin called his father . " Can you take Lisa for a while ? " he asked . Earlier , John Jones had visited his son twice , continuing to press his own plans for the baby . The couple learned that Jones had also been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange . Exactly what happened on May 17 , 1968 , bears directly on a question now before the courts : Who are the legal parents of Lisa Jones ? John Jones , with a lawyer 's training , maintains that he remembers every detail . Jean and Kevin overwrought on that day , say that so things are hazy in their minds . " I just had to block out a lot , " Jean says .. All three agree that Kevin 's father arrived at five P.m. at Friendship port outside Baltimore , and rented car , reaching their apartment at 6:30 . Mr. Jones explained that he was leaving on an eight P.M. plane ; that a notary was waiting at the airport to with Jean and Kevin 's signatures to a document ; and that they had to hurry . In ten minutes they all got into the Kevin driving , Jean beside him with the baby in her arms . Jones says he handed Jean the paper and asked her to read it aloud to Kevin as drove . The young couple are not s about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court in Topeka , Kans. , is titled , with further elucidation , " Consent . " stating that Jean and Kevin are the married parents of a baby girl , it ready " . they voluntarily consent to adoption of said baby by John F. Jo ' and Virginia Jones , and the said ratUral parents relinquish all their rig in and to said child . " " I guess I read the paper , but as as understanding it , no , " Jean told recently . " You can imagine the emotional state I was in . I was holding baby . " Both she and Kevin recall the Kevin asked his father , " This is n't as adoption , is it ? " and that Jones replied smoothly that it was merely a formality required to take the baby across state lines and to grant him authorization far surgery , if it were necessary . " He was Kevin 's father and he was a lawyer . and I thought that 's what you had to do . " Jean was then 18 , and Kevin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . All agree that when they reached the airport at 7:25 , the notary said he was late for another appointment , witnessed the signatures and hurried off . They had to run tot the plane gate , arriving just before it closed . " As I handed the baby to Kevin 's father , " Jean says , " he made some conment like , Do n't worry , she 's still yours , ' something that gave me the feeling everything was fine . " The plane took off . Then Jean cried . Four and a half months later , John and Virginia Jones , who by then had moved to Kansas , legally adopted their grandchild . They told their older son . Stephen , also a Kansas lawyer , not to reveal their action to the young couple Jean and Kevin say they would have contested the adoption had they known about it . The grandparents changed the baby 's name to Jennifer , but did n't admit even this to Kevin and Jean for several years . " I really felt angry when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But they were doing so much for her What could I say ? " continued on page 150  | John Jones has refused to talk with me , but his lawyer , Ralph Skoog , answered my query about the secrecy with some irritation : " I do n't know what a big mystery it is . No one ever lied to them . " He explained that Jones wanted the young couple to marry to legitimize Jennifer , and felt that knowledge of the adoption might discourage marriage plans . He continued , " Kevin and Jean did n't appear to care . There were only a couple of communications a year , like , Send me money . How is Lisa ? ' ; hardly a vigorous exercise of parental concern . " Jean and Kevin tell a different story . " There was never a day when I did n't think about her , " Jean says , and Kevin adds that they telephoned his parents about every two weeks , and wrote frequently . Kevin spent Jennifer 's first Christmas with his family , and reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prediction of retardation turned out to be dead wrong . Although Jennifer still has a red birthmark on her scalp , halfhidden by her fine blonde hair , she is an unusually bright four-year-old . ) For Jean and Kevin living in Maryland , the next year slipped away . " We were still trying to get ourselves together , " Jean says . " I could n't talk about Jennifer to anyone . I kind of had to put her in the back of my mind . " She was still unable to summon the courage to tell her parents about the baby . One worry ended when Jean 's brother returned safely from Vietnam , but another followed ? her father suffered a serious heart attack . Kevin finished college , and , with his father 's aid , got a job in a New York advertising agency in the fall of 1969 . He gave Jean an engagement ring , but still was n't quite ready for marriage . Acutely conscious that his father had paid for his college and that Jean had helped support them with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own a little bit , " he explains . A traditional church wedding finally took place in November , 1969 , in Wilmette on Jean 's twentieth birthday . Kevin 's brother , Stephen , was best man , and his parents attended , leaving Jennifer with a sitter . The senior Jones had retired from the Chicago corporation , joined a Kansas law firm , and built a large ranch house in Lyndon , Kans. , next door to Stephen , his wife , Kay , and their children . Kevin and Jean went out to Kansas to spend Christmas with his parents . Nineteen months had passed since Jean had seen her infant , and now Jennifer was a toddler . " She was beautiful , and so lovable , " Jean recalls . When Jennifer would waken at night , Jean would jump up . But so would her father-in-law ? " as if he wanted to beat me to the punch . " But Jean fed and dressed her baby . " When we left , it was all I could do not to take her on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk of the future . " We had no definite plans ourselves , " Jean says . Another year passed before that was to change , In the fall of 1970 , with Jean working for the Nabisco Company in New York , Kevin got a job ? which he loved ? in the unsuccessful senatorial campaign of Congressman Richard Ottinger and decided to attend law school and make a political career for himself . " We really felt like we were getting on our own feet and going to be happy and could plan for our baby , " Jean says . At Christmastime they asked the senior Joneses to let Jennifer visit them in New York , but the grandparents refused and paid the young couple 's way out to Kansas instead . That was Kevin and Jean 's first hint that regaining their child was n't going to be easy . " We knew we could n't just grab her away and say , Now we 're your parents , ' " Jean says . " We wanted to make her feel secure with us gradually and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her up . We were never ungrateful to them for all they had done . " That spring , Kevin was admitted to Washburn University Law School in Topeka , Kans. , only 30 miles from Lyndon , and in August the young couple moved to Topeka . Relations with John and Virginia were ambivalent , according to Kevin 's brother : " My parents would cuss them out one minute and invite them to dinner the next . " At first , Jean and Kevin spent weekends in Lyndon to be with Jennifer . Then they asked for permission to take her to their home in Topeka for weekends . The grandparents reluctantly agreed . Stephen 's wife , Kay , observed developments with growing discomfort . " Stephen 's parents were probably quite frightened when Jean and Kevin came here . I noticed that when Jennifer barked her knee , she would run to her mother . There must have been jealousy . The simplest solution would have been for them to sit down and talk things out . " But no one seemed able to talk about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't people you can talk to easily , " Kay says . Soon Kay could dissemble no longer . " The Joneses had always said we should n't tell Jean and Kevin that they had adopted Jennifer , but you simply could n't keep putting these things off . " In late fall she walked next door and confronted her father-in-law . " Either you tell them , or I will , " she warned . " All right , all right , " John Jones replied . But a week passed and he said nothing . " So I kind of gulped and told them , " Kay recalls . " Their reaction was surprise , disbelief . " Despite this revelation , Jean and Kevin were optimistic about the future , so optimistic that they decided to tell Jean 's family about Jennifer , and to take her to Wilmette at Christmas to meet her other grandparents . Jean says , " We made it plain to the Joneses then that we wanted Jennifer back , and we hoped we could all work things out , " But nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child for Christmas . In Wilmette , Jean 's large , warm family all turned out to meet the new granddaughter . " That was just about the happiest time in my life , " Jean recalls wistfully . But the senior Joneses were not happy at all . During January , 1972 , 150 @# they wrangled with Jean and Kevin over trivial matters , like Jennifer 's missing Sunday school because of her weekends in Topeka . Typically , their real concerns remained unvoiced : their distrust of the young couple 's life-style . of their relaxed attitude toward a child 's routine , of Kevin 's future plans to return to New York and make a career in politics . By then Kay and Stephen were taking sides in the controversy : they believed that Jennifer belonged with her parents , and said so Now the grandparents felt that both their sons had turned against them . Late in January , Kay Jones told Jean that something peculiar was going on next door . John and Virginia had sold their tractor and their sheep and given away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February 7 , Kay noticed that their house was locked up . Grandparents and grandchild had vanished . For the next few weeks , Kevin and Jean , distraught , prayed that it was merely an unannounced vacation . But on February 25 , a six-page letter arrived in John Jones ' handwriting , addressed to his sons and their wives . " We can not exist under the conditions which the four of you insist on imposing upon us , " the letter began . " Stephen and Kevin , we resign as your parents We quit ! . . . we have moved permanently from Lyndon . . . if you try to find us , we will move still farther away . " It ended , " Finis , " followed by the formal signature , " Mr. and Mrs. John F. Jones . " The letter blamed all four : " You have required your mother to give up her friends , her home . . . you have forced me to give up the practice of law ... and sit around with nothing to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loving and raising a granddaughter whom no one else would raise . " It accused Kevin and Jean : " You came to Kansas deliberately and underhandedly to accomplish what you selfishly wanted . Why , in God 's name , would n't you accept your responsibilities as parents when Jennifer was born ? . . . All you have been willing to do is beget her and then cast her off to the four winds .... " In his letter Jones offered to returr . Jennifer if Kevin lived his life according to his father 's rules . First , he and Jean must be passed on as prospective parents by a Topeka adoption agency . But Jones said he would show the agency his files on Kevin 's college suspension " and each of the encounters with the law regarding drunkenness ... If you can qualify , and I ca n't conceive that you can , she will be sent back , subject to one big qualification . . . that Kevin continue in law school without interruption ... that he get a job as a law clerk with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . . . and that he decide to practice law west of the Mississippi River . . . This means no more New York . When we know that these things are actually the case , you can then have custody of Jennifer ... . If there is any deviation on his part . then forget about her . " Virginia added a note . She accused Stephen 's wife of hating and resenting  | her ; Jean of bringing Jennifer home after weekends exhausted , resentful and terribly confused . " To her o sons , she wrote : " I ca n't resign ' as your motherbut I can despise you the hurt you have inflicted upon a good man ? your father . " Jean was heartbroken . " It just shot my whole world . I felt I would never see Jennifer again . I could do nothing but cry every night . When I was n't crying , I was screaming , Why ca n't we do something ? " Although they had no *money , Kevin and Jean consulted Ernest J. Rice , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fee . Rice filed suit m Topeka , with Jean and Kevin as plaintiffs , and John and Virginia as defendants , charging " ... that defendants did unlawfully , maliciously and with fraud , entice the plaintiffs to part with the custody of their child . that although plaintiffs made demand upon defendants to return custody . defendants have refused . " At this writing , that suit is still pending . Now the battle was finally in the courts , but it was like punching empty air . Trial could not start mitil John and Virginia Jones were legally served with notice of the suit , but no one knew where they were . A cousin of Virginia 's had their address : she would not reveal it , but she would forward letters . Jean wrote a pleading letter and so did her mother ? as one grandparent to another . They received no answer . March passed , and April . ' Believe me , I was really a basket ease by then , " Jean says . In mid-May Kevin 's school year ended . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our friends in New York , " Jean says . One week after the two left Kansas , the senior Joneses returned with Jennifer . Kevin telephoned his lawyer to serve the legal papers in a hurry . But he and Jean were 1,200 miles away , and John Jones was on home ground where he had friends and influence . Kevin 's brother is certain that his parents were at home during the last week in May , but on June 1 , the papers were returned from Lyndon with the notation , ' Not found . " Later that month , speaking through his lawyer , John Jones agreed to answer the suit if it were shifted from Topeka to Lyndon . Kevin and Jean were outraged . They felt that Kevin 's father had snatched control of the suit from their hands . They also learned that the Joneses ' Lyndon house , worth over $50,000 , was up for sale . To them , this appeared a double-barreled threat : Either Jones would maneuver the law suit to his own advantage , or he would again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustration , they determined to confront Kevin 's father and demand to keep Jennifer until the trial started ( no date had yet been set ) . They asked Jean 's parents to accompany them to Kansas . " If the Joneses thought of us as young punks , " Jean says , " maybe they could talk to my parents on an adult level " But things did n't go the way they 'd planned at all . On a hot day in Lyndon , July 10 , all the anger and fear on both sides exploded into a shouting , pushing free-for-all . Jean and Kevin arrived at the Jones house at dawn , and waited until John Jones opened the garage door at 7:30 A.m . When he saw them , he started to retreat . " Wait a minute , " they called . " We just want to talk to you . " Mrs. Jones and Jennifer were nowhere in sight . There were loud words and pushing as the three straggled at the door . " If they say I was screaming , I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're going to sign for us to take her , just like you made me sign . ' " Stephen appeared next door at his garage , and Jones ordered his older son to call the sheriff . Stephen refused . Jones made a dash for his own house , but Jean barred the way . In the scuffle which followed , Jean claims that her father-in-law knocked her down . John Jones says he sustained a hernia . Entering the house , Jean burst into a bedroom and found Virginia Jones and @#  | Jennifer . She picked up the child and carried her to the car . " We drove down the road to a rest area , " Jean says . " I did n't want Jennifer to hear all this . " There , mother and daughter talked for the first time in five months . " There was n't a tear from Jennifer , " Jean says . " She told me , Mommy , if I had known it was you outside , I would have let you in . ' Then she chattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a city marshal arrived at the Lyndon house . John Jones demanded that he hold Jean 's parents and Kevin under arrest until Jennifer was returned . Instead , the marshal tried to mediate the dispute . Finally , he persuaded Jones to sign a paper giving Jean 's parents ? not Jean and Kevin ? custody of Jennifer , but only for two weeks . Shakily , Jones wrote out the document himself . ( Later he charged that the agreement was forced on him " under duress and coercion physically and otherwise . " ) Two hours passed before the group left . Jean and Jennifer returned to the house . The child kissed her grandparents good-bye , and Virginia kissed Kevin . The following evening , Kevin telephoned his parents to report their safe arrival in Illinois . But Jennifer did not remain with the Labbes , nor was she returned to Kansas on July 25 , the date agreed upon . Convinced that if they brought her back , the senior Joneses would again flee the country , Jean and Kevin took the child to New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were just using the same tactics they used on us when they went to Mexico , " Jean explains . Each night they camped out with a different friend . " Jennifer thought it was great fun , " Jean says , " but I did n't . Believe me , I hated having her shuffled around that way . " Meanwhile , in Kansas , " For Sale " signs had appeared in front of the Joneses ' house and John and Virginia moved to a nearby town . Shortly before their departure , Stephen Jones discovered in his garage two large , framed pictures which his parents had cherished ? one of Kevin as a child , the other of Stephen at his law-school graduation . There was no note . To Stephen it was a symbolic gesture that relations were irrevocably severed . But the struggle for Jennifer continued . On July 25 , Jones obtained a court order , calling on Kevin and Jean to " produce Jennifer Lisa Jones ... immediately . " Ten days later the court gave him " the right to physically take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal sanction to go to New York and take Jennifer . But he did n't stop there . On August 5 , he swore out a complaint charging Jean and Kevin with two criminal acts : kidnapping ? taking their daughter " with the intent to hold the said Jennifer Lisa Jones for ransom and to terrorize another , to wit : John F. Jones and Virginia Jones " ; and burglary , entering the Jones home " with the intent to commit a felony , to wit : the kidnapping of Jennifer Lisa Jones . " In New York , Jean had run out of friends to stay with , and on August 7. she and Jennifer went home to their apartment , planning to remain a few days . Neither Jean nor Kevin knew that a warrant was out for their arrest , or that private detectives were watching the apartment . The next morning Jean left early to go to work . Kevin , still job-hunting , decided to take Jennifer to the park . As the two strolled down the street , three men approached them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and started to present a warrant , a second grabbed Jennifer and took her to a parked car where John Jones was seated . As Kevin scuffled with the men , the car started up . Kevin yelled for police , and then took off in pursuit on a bicycle provided by a passerby . Two blocks away a policeman stopped both bike and car , and took them all to a police station . Jones was accompanied by half a dozen men : Ralph Skoog , his Topeka lawyer ; attorneys from two New York law firms ; and several private detectives . Furious , Kevin threatened to kill his father . He was handcuffed to a chair . When Jean , who rarely cries in public , received the news , she became hysterical . Her employer went with her to the police station . There she was not allowed to approach Jennifer , who , always the peacemaker , called across the room , " Mommy , I told Grandpa I could go back and visit him in Kansas . " " Kevin 's father looked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie undone , pacing the floor . I said , How can you do this ? You know she 's our child . ' He did n't answer . " Jean ran home to telephone friends to raise bail for Kevin , and then returned to the station house . But at the door , her employer warned her not to go in . " They have a warrant for your arrest , too , " he told her . Inside the police station , Kevin was put under arrest . Helplessly he watched as his father and Jennifer , almost hidden by a phalanx of lawyers and detectives , walked out . He was held in jail overnight , until friends raised $500 in lieu of $5,000 bail . The day 's events were reported to newspapers nationally and on television . A week later , Jean surrendered voluntarily . She was jailed for 15 hours ( " the worst in my life , " she says ) , first in a filthy cell with 40 other prisoners ? all drug addicts or prostitutes or both ? and later in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Island . At this writing , Jean and Kevin a. free on bail while their lawyer , Fred erick H.

Mr. Cohn 's purpose is to give young couple time to earn or ra money for what lies ahead . But even if New York should re to extradite them , Jean and Kevin v. have gotten exactly nowhere . Je is in Kansas with her grandparents . her parents ever hope to see her ag they must go back , win acquittal of kidnapping charge , and then fight in civil courts for her custody . Friends scoff at the likelihood t : Kevin and Jean could be convicted kidnapping , but the two are scar Kevin maintains , " My father a way of convincing people to things . " Thus far he seems to be rig No grand jury has indicted Kevin Jean ? this is unnecessary under Kansas law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governors ap to be based solely on acceptance of Jo Jones ' affidavit , giving his version the alleged kidnapping . When I ask Clyde Burns , acting county attorney Lyndon , about the agreement which gave Jean 's parents temporary cust of Jennifer on the day she was alleg kidnapped , he replied , " I did n't see agreement . " He added , " When so body signs a complaint , there 's not the county attorney can do . " Each day 's installment of a soap o ends with a cliff-hanger , and that 's way it is now with this real-life me drama . Should the young couple turn to Kansas to face a charge of napping ? " We 're at the point where just want to get it over with , " Je says . But they are fearful of fighting John Jones ' home territory , and spending months in the Lyndon jail until the trial ends .

" It will cost a fortune , perhaps $30,000 , to do it right , " he says . No one sympathetic to Kevin and Jean has that kind of money . How did it all happen ? Why are three generations of a family being destroyed ? What lesson does it offer for other parents and their children ? Ostensibly the clash started over the adoption of an unborn child . " Having a child adopted out of the family v.-as something that Kevin could live with. , but his father could not , " Kay Jones observes . Underneath , the standards at one generation are posed against those of another .

John Jones thought yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kevin ? and many of his generation ? answers no . Another question : How long can a father maintain : hat he " knows best , " and use his parental and financial clout to enforce his viewpoint ? Kevin did not want his child adopted by his parents , but Jones overrode his son 's wishes . Kevin wanted his daughter back , but Jones did not consider his son a fit parent . Should a grandfather have the power to make such a judg-ment ? John and Virginia Jones can not believe that their son has grown to responsible adulthood . " They feel they are saving their grandchild from an uncertain future , that they are fighting a battle of righteousness , " Allen Jones ( no relation ) , the Methodist minister in Lyndon , explains . John Jones believes that his goal provides justification for his methods . He wrote from Mexico , " I 'm not proud of myself , but to us , Jennifer 's well-being and future are more important than the kind of tactics required to protect her . " Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five victims .

They have spent thousands of dollars battling for their grandchild . If they finally succeed , an aging couple will have the responsibility of raising a lively preschooler . For this they will have lost their sons and their other grandchildren . Jean and Kevin 's lives are in shambles , their future in limbo . They smoke too much , sleep too little , talk singlemindedly about their troubles . Kevin had hoped to become a lawyer ; Jean , a teacher . But ? " every time you even apply for a job , " Jean says , " there 's the question : Have you ever been arrested ? What chance will we have when we answer : Oh , yes , for kidnapping .
