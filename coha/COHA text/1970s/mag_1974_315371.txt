British Playwright Tom Stoppard chain-smokes ideas like cigarettes and emits the smoke with puffs of mirth . The latest display of his intellectual curiosity , verbal agility and quirky sense of humor is Jumpers ( TIME , March 11 ) , a comedy currently on view at Manhattan 's Billy Rose Theater . Jumpers is a philosophical roller coaster careering dizzyingly along the parallel tracks of wit and logic over such subjects as the existence or nonexistence of God , the nature of good and evil , and the interdependence of ethics and metaphysics . <P> It is a breath-stopping ride . Among the passengers are George , an absent-minded professor of moral philosophy absorbed in his upcoming lecture billed " Man-Good , Bad or Indifferent ? " ; his ex-showgirl-songstress wife Dotty ; and her psychiatrist lover , Sir Archibald Jumper , who is the vice chancellor and pragmatic villain of the college where George teaches . More bizarre companions include George 's secretary , who likes to striptease while swinging by her teeth from a chandelier ; a troupe of yellow-clad acrobats ( " a mixture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the more gymnastic members of the philosophy school " ) ; and a corpse in a plastic bag named McFee . <P> Born in Zlin . Though Stoppard ravels and unravels the destinies of these characters , that is not his prime concern . Utilizing the Socratic method of perpetual questioning , he is assessing the destinies of 20th century man in a Shavian play of jousting ideas . In dramatic kinship , Jumpers is a child of Shaw 's Heartbreak House . In that play , written shortly before World War I , Shaw dramatized the sundering of the social fabric of Western civilization . Stoppard is concerned with the moral fabric , the abyss of nonbelief . He sees man , devoid of metaphysical absolutes , as rending his fellow man and reducing the planet to a desolate , lifeless cipher rather like the moon , which is a key symbol in Jumpers . <P> Stoppard , with his large , luminous brown eyes that seem to pierce both inward and outward , is a bit of a moon gazer . His background , like his voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Zlin , Czechoslovakia , in 1937 as Thomas Straussler . When he was two years old , his father , a doctor , moved to Singapore . As the Japanese began infiltrating Southeast Asia , Tom , his mother and his older brother were sent on to India . ( His father later died in a Japanese prison camp . ) Tom learned English in Darjeeling . Taking his stepfather 's name , he arrived in England in 1946 as Tom Stoppard . <P> At 17 he quit school to sign on as a cub reporter with a Bristol paper . Starting on the police beat , he was eventually reviewing films and plays . In retrospect , he says , " I did n't really enjoy it . I felt I was a critic by instinct , not by credentials . I kept thinking I only put into print what other people were saying in the bar during intermission . " Nonetheless , he made amusing use of the experience later when he wrote The Real Inspector Hound ( TIME , May 8 , 1972 ) , a caustic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an Agatha Christie-style mystery thriller .
