take care of that , and there was actually a festive spirit prevailingon the night of the dance . Edna 's guests for dinner were Eddie Noisrander and his friend , Pat Boyle ; Bertha Linkletter and her date , Ann Collins and her date , Emily Noisrander and her date , and Clare Shipstead and her date . Eddie Noisrander and Pat Boyle owned their own Tuxedos ; the other boys hired theirs at Kauffman 's or the Outlet . Clare Shipstead'sdate wore a pair of high-button shoes belonging to his father , but at least they were black . Eddie Noisrander and Pat Boyle wore the badge of the Psi Upsilon fraternity on their waistcoats ; Bertha Linkletter 's date wore the pledge pin of Sigma Chi in his lapel , and Ann Collins 's date wore not only the Delta Tau Delta badge on his waistcoat but the key of Kappa Beta Phi on his watchchain . Naturally there was a good deal of good-natured raillery over the Kappa Beta key , and it helped to break the ice . The girls wore dresses from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wore dresses from Hudson 's . Faith borrowed hers from Edna . It was the first time Mrs. Everett had had to put all the leaves in the dining-room table , for which she required the expert assistanceof her husband . They had a table cover large enough for the table , but it had never been used , and Mrs. Everett decided to save it for Edna 's wedding , and use doilies instead . " I 'd hate to see cigarette ashes ruin our good table cover , " said Mrs. Everett . " How many of the girls smoke ? " said Paul Everett . " None of them , I hope , but the boys all do , " said Mrs. Everett . " That 's entirely up to you , " said Paul Everett . " Do you want to have candles on the table ? " " I think it would be nice , Christmassy , " said Mrs. Everett . " Well , I have to go and put on my Tux , " said Paul Everett . " You finish setting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have to be at the Wendells ' by eight . " " I do n't think I 'll put candles on the table after all . It 's too dim , " said Mrs. Everett.  | " Suit yourself , but remember the Wendells . I 'll be ready for a snort by the time we get there , " said Paul Everett . " You and your snort , " said Mrs. Everett . " Harry Wendell does n't want one any more than you do , but you think because it 's Christmas you have to have one . " " Well , we 're going to , " said Paul Everett . There were no snorts for the guests at Edna Everett 's party , and they began to arrive past the hour when Paul Everett and his wife had taken off for the Wendells ' , thereby depriving the Paul Everetts of the pleasure of greeting them . " I wanted to see what Bertha Linkletter would be wearing , " said Mrs. Everett . " Some outlandish thing , I 'm sure . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Paul Everett . " That is n't the same , " said Mrs. Everett , without explaining why . Edna and Faith said goodbye to Mr. and Mrs. Everett and fifteen minutes was expended in the necessary introductions , and dinner was announced at eight-thirty . Place cards directed the guests to their seats , and the soup was served by Olga , the Everetts ' maid , assisted by Gretta , who was helping Olga for the evening . Gretta was more accustomed to serving traveling salesmen at the Hotel Wingate , but she had the night off because the Hotel Wingate was empty during the Christmas season , and working at the Everetts ' gave her a chance to pick up an extra two dollars . She also supplied her own uniform , which Olga did not have , and which added a certain elegance to the occasion . Gretta , who called Edna " dear , " was the hit of the evening , and exchanged pleasantries with all the boys until about halfway through the meal . Olga then took over the serving chore ; Gretta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Everett reserved for a cold . Aside from that , the dinner proceeded according to plan . The main course was roast chicken , with chestnut stuffing , followed by plum pudding with hard sauce , and at ten o'clock the partygoers were ready to put on their arctics and brave the slush and snow on the two-block walk to the Wingate Tennis Club.  |p28They  were all to meet at the club , where a table had been held for them . " How did it go ? " said Mrs. Everett . " Gretta got intoxicated . Otherwise it went fine , " said Edna . " I was afraid of something like that . Just wait till she comes around for her pay , " said Mrs. Everett . " But all the others had a good time ? What did you talk about ? " " Oh , I do n't know , Mother , " said Edna . " Did Faith have a good time ? " said Mrs. Everett . " The party was in her honor . " " I guess she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Edna . " The party is n't over yet . It 's just beginning . This dance goes on till one o'clock , and is it all right if I ask them back to the house after ? " " All of them ? What will we give them ? " said Mrs. Everett . " Oh , scrambled eggs , " said Edna . " I hope we have enough eggs , " said Mrs. Everett . " Is that the thing to do ? " " Some will come and some wo n't , but I have to invite them all , " said Edna . " I must get back to my guests . " The fox trot was just catching on in Michigan , the one-step had already arrived , the maxixe had come and gone , the waltz was the waltz . But Faith McCracken had never learned to dance , and had not told Edna . " Oh , everybody can do the waltz , " said Edna . " Go on and try . You and Pat , go on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a try , but Faith was a hopeless partner . She gave up , and halfway through the first waltz she sat down , determined not to move out of her chair again . " I told you I could n't dance , " said Faith . " Well , if you ca n't , you ca n't , " said Edna . " I just wish you had told me beforehand . I thought everybody could waltz . " " Everybody but me , " said Faith . " In China I never learned . It was sort of against our religion . " " Well , do you mind if I do ? " said Edna.  | " No , you go ahead , " said Faith . All the others fox-trotted and one-stepped and waltzed as the evening went on , and several times Faith was left alone at the table as the extra man found a partner from another table . At one o'clock the orchestra played " Good Night , Ladies , " and there was an abortive effort to keep the orchestra for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let 's all go back to my house for some scrambled eggs , " said Edna . But excuses were made , and Edna finally realized that her party had been a failure . Eddie Noisrander and Pat Boyle escorted the girls home and left them at the front door . " If it 's all the same to you , I think I 'll go to bed , " said Edna . " I 'm more tired than I thought . " " I 'm sorry I spoiled your party , " said Faith . " Oh , that 's all right . Sleep as late as you like , " said Edna . " I 'm really sorry , " said Faith . " I 've been a terrible house guest . " " Not at all . Goodnight , " said Edna . " Do n't lock up . My parents are n't home yet . " She retired to her room , took off her dress , and lay on the bed . She must have fallen asleep ; at any rate she came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her wrapper and found the lights off downstairs and her parents ' bedroom door closed . And she smelled gas coming from the guest-room bathroom . Faith McCracken lay naked on the bathroom floor , and she was dead . It was a little after four in the morning . It was not her fault . She kept telling herself it was not her fault . Her mother told her it was not her fault . Her father not only did not consider it her fault , but he had not even bothered to pass a judgment on her . Her father knew something that neither she nor her mother knew : at the coroner 's autopsy it transpired that Faith McCracken was three months pregnant , and Paul Everett kept that fact to himself . According to his reckoning , the father of the unbornchild was most likely the boy who worked in the post office atp30Amherst . But what was the use of adding that bit of scandal to the already abundant disgrace ? " Do you have to say that ? " said Paul Everett . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Maybe she did n't even know she was pregnant . She certainly did n't look it . And I 'm not sure the young man at Amherst was the father . It could have been anybody . " The coroner , who was a good friend of Paul Everett 's and a brother Mason , was inclined to agree with Paul . " There 's no doubt about her committing suicide , " said the coroner . " Can you think of any reason for it ? " " Yes , I can . She was homesick . Homesick and miserable . That 's why Edna invited her to spend Christmas with us , " said Paul Everett . " We 'll bury her as soon as the ground gets soft enough , and we 'll bury her secret with her . " " You 're a kind man , Paul , " said the coroner . " I 'm willing , if you are . " If I am ? " said Paul Everett . " If you do n't say anything to your wife . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , I do n't think it 'll be necessary to tell her . " Edna returned to Ann Arbor in the expectation of a battery of questions , but Faith McCracken was soon forgotten . She was that kind of girl . Edna wrote a letter to Frank Carlson at Amherst , telling him of Faith 's suicide and returning unopened two letters from him , but she never had an answer from him , not even an acknowledgment of her communications . The midyear examinationsoccupied her attention , and she found that she too had come to forget Faith McCracken . The truth was she had never known her . Faith 's clothes and her personal possessions became a bit of a nuisance until Edna turned them all over to the dean of women to dispose of them . " I 've written to her mother in China , " said Edna . " A very difficult letter to write , I 'm sure , " said the dean . " Yes , it was , " said Edna . " The most difficult letter I 've ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 've given you all her things ? " " Of course , " said the dean . " Then that 's taken care of , " said Edna . And truly it was . At last she faced the fact that she had never really liked Faith McCracken . It was a great relief . Eddie Noisrander and Faith McCracken got out of Edna 's life at about the same time and with almost equal positiveness . One day on campus Eddie introduced Edna and Bill Ewing , and there was never any doubt from that moment on that it was a match . Bill Ewing , a fourth-year man in the law school , had not paid much attention to the pretty freshman , had not even spoken to her . There were plenty of pretty freshmen who knew about Bill Ewing , whose father was a prominent lawyer in Cleveland , and who was himself nicknamed The Judge . " I know you , you 're The Judge , " said Edna . " Why do they call you that ? " " Ask Eddie , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call me The Judge ? " " I guess because you 're sober as a judge , " said Eddie . " Are you ? " said Edna . " I probably am , " said Bill Ewing . " At least I am compared with Eddie . " " Oh , come on , " said Eddie . " I may take a snort now and then , but Edna knows I 'm not a drunk . " " I 've never even known Eddie to take a snort , " said Edna . " He 's never taken one when he was with me . " " Thanks , Edna , " said Eddie . " I have to rush . I have an eleven o'clock . " He left them . " So long , " said Bill Ewing . " Do you mind if I walk the rest of the way with you ? " " My name is Edna Everett . No , I do n't mind . I 'm only going to the drug store . " " I 'll buy you a soda . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soda , " said Edna . " I 'd like to , " said Bill . " I liked the way you came to Eddie 's defensejust now . " " Oh , I get sick and tired of people accusing Eddie of being adrunk . I 've never known him to take a drink , " said Edna . " That 's what I mean . Eddie drinks , but who does n't ? " " That 's what I mean , " said Edna . " I guess it 's because his familyown a brewery . " " And I 'm called The Judge because my father is a lawyer and I 'm studying law . " " You might as well call me The Joiner . My father owns a furniturefactory , and a joiner is another word for a man who makes furniture . " " Yes , I knew that , " said Bill Ewing . " Are you from Wingate ? Is that how you happened to know Eddie ? " " Yes , we 're both from Wingate , " said Edna . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard that a thousand times , " said Bill Ewing . " Not quite a thousand , but I 've heard it , " said Edna . " It 's still nice to hear it . " " That 's good . I was afraid you 'd think me fresh . " " No , I do n't think you 're fresh , " said Edna . By accident he saw her again the same day and she smiled at him and he smiled at her . Miss Everett , Mr. Ewing , were the exchange of words , but they had been thinking of each other , and for the next couple of days they continued to think of each other , and when next they met on the street Bill said , " I was wondering whether you ever go to the basketball games ? " " Occasionally , " said Edna . " I 'm not crazy about the game , the way some girls are , but I go occasionally . " " Will you go to the game with me Saturday night ? I confess I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think . " " Yes , it 's Butler , " said Edna.  | " You do n't sound very enthusiastic , " said Bill Ewing . " I told you I was n't very crazy about basketball , " said Edna . " Then how about going for a spin in my car ? I have a Saxon I just bought . It has no top . " " I 've seen you driving around in it . I 'd rather do that than go to the basketball game , " said Edna . " What 'll we do if it snows ? " " We 'll just have to let it snow , " said Edna . " What time will you stop for me ? " " Seven o'clock ? Will that be all right ? " " Yes . I live at the Kappa Gamma Theta house . Do you know where it is ? " said Edna . " I know you do , " said Bill Ewing . " I 've found out quite a bit about you . " " You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a lot more , " said Bill Ewing . " I 'll see you Saturday at seven o'clock . Oh , I forgot to ask you to dinner . You can have dinner with me , ca n't you ? " " That will be very nice , " said Edna . They went to a place about twenty miles from Ann Arbor . " This is Paul 's . Did you ever hear of it ? It 's where the Dekes had their banquet this year . " " Looks nice , " said Edna . " Paul is a Frenchman and he knows how to cook , if you like French food . I made a reservation , so he 's expecting us . Otherwise you have to wait , especially Saturday . Ah , good evening , Paul . " " Good evening , Mr. Ewing . I have a nice table for you . Good evening , mademoiselle . " " Good evening . Is there a place where I can fix my hair ? " said Edna . " Of course , mademoiselle , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to the table and they had ordered the filet mignon on Paul 's recommendation , Edna folded her hands andp34said , " You told me the other day that you know a lot about me , and then announced that you were going to find out a lot more . Pro-ceed . " " Proceed ? All right . First of all , is Eddie Noisrander the NumberOne man in your life ? " " Eddie Noisrander ? Yes , I suppose he is . I 've dated Eddie more than anyone else , so I suppose that makes him the Number One man . Next question . " " I took very careful notice , and I noticed that Eddie still wears his fraternity pin , " said Bill Ewing . " Yes , " said Edna . " Is n't that , to say the least , unusual ? " said Bill . " You mean why do n't I wear his Psi U pin ? I 'll tell you why . Fraternity pins do n't mean a thing . A girl wears a boy 's fraternity -s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but what does it mean ? It should mean that they 're engaged , but I know a girl who has four pins and she changes them all the time . When I get ready to wear a boy 's pin it 'll be that boy 's pin and no one else 's . And the boy will be ready to buy me an engagement ring , which does mean some-thing . " " That makes sense , " said Bill . " Does it answer your second question ? It should answer your first . Eddie Noisrander is the boy I 've dated the most , but I 'm not ready to be serious with him . I 'll never be . There 's only one boy I could be serious with . " " Is he at Ann Arbor ? " " Yes , he 's at Ann Arbor , " said Edna . " It 's you . " " Me ? " " Oh , yes . I could be serious with you . But do n't let it alarm you . I have three more years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , I may not , and meanwhile you may fall in love with some other girl and marry her . That would be awful for me , but I 'll just have to bear it . " " I think you 're pulling my leg , Edna , " said Bill.  | " It may sound that way , but I 'm not . Just because I have n't even kissed you , just because this is our first date , does n't mean I have n't made up my mind . But I may change . There 's always that . " " The shrimp cocktail for mademoiselle ? " said Paul . " S'il vous plait , " said Edna . " That 's the first time I 've spoken French to a Frenchman . " " Mademoiselle parle Francais , " said Paul . " Un pew , " said Edna . " As long as you understand it . " " Je eomprends votre Francais tres bien , mademoiselle , " said Paul . " Where did you learn French ? " said Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one year at Ann Arbor , " said Edna . " No , two years in high school and one at Ann Arbor . I finished high school in three years and then my parents made me stay another year because I was too young for college . " " I was n't trying to change the subject , but Paul interrupted , " said Bill . " I 'd finished what I was saying , " said Edna . " Do you want to talk about something else ? I 'd as soon . I was telling you how serious I was about you , but there 'll be plenty of time for that . I just want you to know , Bill Ewing , that I am serious about you . No fraternitypinstuff . I 've made up my mind that you 're the man I 'm going to marry  --  if you do n't marry someone else first . But I do n't really think you will . " " Will you please tell me why ? You have n't fallen in love with me . " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not romantically , not the fraternity-pin kind of love . But I think I always knew who I 'd want to spend the rest of my life with . The boy would have to be serious about what he was doing  --  I used to think it would be a doctor , but a lawyer 's just as good . He 'd have to know what he wanted to do by the time he went to college , not just a boy who wanted to waste a lot of time deciding . My father is n't a doctor or a lawyer , but he made up his mind about two things . One , he was going to marry my mother , and two , he was going to takep36over the business he started out in . He married my mother when he was twenty-one and they did n't have much money , and he started up the Everett Manufacturing Company when it was Harvey Brothers carpenter shop , and he changed the name . That 's one and two . Three , he was never going to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His father was born in Wingate and went away to the Civil War , but he came back and took to drink and never amounted to anything , but my father was different . I can remember my father saying to my mother that he was going to be one Everett that the town would be proud of . And now it is . " " Proud of your father ? " " Yes . He did something for that town . Not much , maybe , but he did more for it than anyone else , " said Edna . " I 'm proud of my father  --  although he may not know it . Are you proud of your father ? " " Very , " said Bill Ewing . " Not just because he made a lot of money ? " said Edna . " That too , but the things he did for Cleveland . " " What did he do for Cleveland ? " said Edna . " Well , for one thing , he did n't go to New York when he had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who believes in a town can make the town believe in itself . It 's hard to explain , but I know a lot of people that felt that Cleveland was all right if it was good enough for my father . I suppose it 's much the same as Wingateand your father . " " Yes , I understand that , " said Edna . " New York is n't everything , " said Bill Ewing . " My father wanted to send me East to school . I 'd have gone to Andover or Exeter , and then probably to Yale . But I decided to come to Ann Arbor . I went to day school in Cleveland and then I came here . I may regret it later , not getting a Harvard Law School degree , but right now I see myself as a Middle Western lawyer , with a Middle Western background , marrying a Middle Western girl . " " Who ? Me ? "  | " Yes , you . Who else ? " said Bill Ewing . " That 's nice , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ? That 's nice ' ? " said Bill Ewing . " That 's all for the present . Here 's Paul with my filet mignon , " said Edna . Later , in Bill 's Saxon , she kissed him . " I wo n't hold you to your proposal , " she said . " You have to have time to think it over . " " Do you have to think it over ? " he said . " Not really , but we both have to think it over . " " Did n't you like the way I kissed you ? " he said . " Well , I have to think that over , too , " said Edna . " Did I like the way you kissed me ? Yes , I did . Although I was really the one who kissed you . I had to do everything tonight . The proposing , the kissing . " " You know that 's not true , " said Bill Ewing . " I know it is true , but I guess that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time on there was no one else for Edna , no one else for Bill Ewing . It was a campus romance , neither of them revealing it as such to their parents , but Paul Everett made a special trip to Ann Arbor to have a talk with his daughter . " What 's this I hear about you and the Ewing boy ? " " I do n't know . What do you hear about me and the Ewing boy ? " " You 're going steady ? " said Paul Everett . " Where did you ever get that expression ? That sounds like somethingOlga would say , " said Edna . " Nevertheless , I suppose it 's true . " " We kept you in high school an extra year because we thought you were too young . I hope you 're not planning to do anything foolish now , " he said . " I 'll do whatever Bill wants me to do . I 'm not going to do anything that you 'd call foolish , Father . " " Sometimes you call me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes you 're Father , sometimes you 're Daddy , " said Edna . " I 'm Father now .

I 'm in love with him , if that 's important . " " It 's the most important thing I have to know , " said Paul Everett . " Your mother has n't heard about this , by the way . I came here on my own . I had business in Detroit and I told her I might see you , but I did n't say why . " " Do n't tell her , " said Edna . " No , I guess I wo n't , " said Paul Everett .

You bought a chair from him last fall , remember ? " " I remember buying a chair , " said Edna . " But it was n't one of your chairs . " " There are other good chairs , " said Paul Everett . " This was a second-hand chair , and when you gave him your name , naturally he remembered and he asked me if I had a daughter here and I asked him to keep an eye on you . Not the way that sounds , but in case you wanted a cheque cashed or anything like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heck of a nice fellow . He 's getting on now , must be pretty close to seventy . Anyway , he wrote me a letter about a month ago and said he did n't have anything to report except that you were seeing a lot of a fellow by the name of Ewing , from down Cleveland way . How he found that out I havep39no idea , but local gossip , I guess . Ann Arbor 's a small town , and if you have nothing better to do , all you have to do is make a few inquiries . " " So you had me spied on , " said Edna . " You must n't think that , Edna . " " I do n't think it , Daddy , honestly I do n't , " said Edna .

" Eddie Noisrander had another girl to take the place of Edna , a Pi Phi sophomore from Detroit who could not conceal her distaste for Edna . Her name was Ruth Velie and she was the daughter of a woman who was an acquaintance of Edna 's mother . Mrs. Everett , anxious to assure Edna of every possible success at Ann Arbor , had written to Mrs. Velie , asking her to look up Edna when she entered the freshman class . Mrs. Velie , who did not know Edna except as the daughter of an acquaintance , turned the matter over to her own daughter , which meant that Ruth Velie was to see that Edna got invited to have tea at the Pi Phi house . But Edna pledged herself to Kappa Gamma Theta , the newest sorority on the campus , without letting the Pi Phis have a look at her , and Ruth Velie felt snubbed . The fact that Edna was pretty did not make it any better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same town and had dated Edna , made it even worse . The two girls could not stand the sight of each other , an animosity that grew each time they double-dated with Eddie Noisrander and Bill Ewing . " Why do n't you like Ruth Velie ?

" " I 'm sorry , Edna . " " It was that talk about Ruth . It was on your mind and on mine , " said Edna . " Ruth did n't have anything to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Bill . " Whatever it was , you must n't do that again , " said Edna . " I 'm only human . " " So am I , " said Bill . " I have desires , the same as anybody else , " said Edna . " You would n't think so , " said Bill . " Somebody has to know when to stop , " said Edna . " If I did n't , we 'd go all the way , and I mean all the way . And then where would we be ? " " But we were meant to go all the way . " " I 'll go all the way with you when the time comes and not before . " " You mean when we 're married ? " said Bill.  | " Yes . " " How long will it be before that ? " said Bill . " If I can wait , so can you , " said Edna . " You must n't let on that I told you about Ruth and Eddie , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edna . " How could I ? " " You might . " " You 're sorry you told me , " said Edna . " Very sorry , " he said . " Well , you need n't be . I think I 'd have known anyway . There 's something in her face , something about the way she looks at you . " " At me ? " " At everybody , " said Edna . " Oh , come on , Edna , " said Bill . " You can tell whether a girl 's gone all the way ? I do n't believe that . " " I do n't care whether you believe it or not , it 's so . " " Do you expect something to show in your face when you 've gone all the way ? " " Yes , I do , " said Edna . " What ? " " I do n't know what , but it 'll show , " said Edna . " If it shows on a girl , why does n't it show on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show on a man . I 've always known it about Eddie . " " Do you know it about me ? " said Bill . " Yes . I know you have n't . " " Well , I have n't , but I do n't see how you know , " said Bill . " Unless Eddie told you about himself . " " Eddie did n't tell me , I just knew , " said Edna . " The way he is with a girl . I would n't be surprised if he started early . Sixteen or even fifteen . " " Then how did he know when to stop with you ? " said Bill . " He went as far as he could , and then I stopped him , " she said.  | " How far was that ? " " He never did what you did , " said Edna . " He never put his hand there . But Ruth and I are different , and she let him go on . She probably could n't help herself . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the only one that 's gone all the way with Ruth . " " Oh , I knew that , " said Edna . " No , you did n't . Not till I told you , " said Bill . " Yes , I did , really . You only confirmed my suspicions . I could tell you about some other girls too , but I wo n't . " " You mean girls in your sorority ? " said Bill . " Oh , I would n't believe them . They 're all virgins , or so they say . " But you can tell those that are n't simply by looking at them ? " said Bill . " Pretty much , " said Edna . " What did you know about Faith McCracken ? " said Bill . " Practically nothing , " said Edna . " It 's an awful thing to say , but I did n't want to know any more about her than I did know . She was a strange girl . She took off all her clothes the night she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure what . " " I never knew her , " said Bill . " Neither did I , really . She was my roommate and a Kappa Gamma Theta and outside of that I hardly knew her . What made you ask about her ? " said Edna . " I do n't know . We had a letter from Frank Carlson , her beau at Amherst , asking for information about her . He was a Deke , and he wrote to John Draper , the king of our chapter , but John had to tell him that nobody knew her . I guess that was before I knew you . I never bothered to tell you , and I do n't know why I bother to tell you now . I guess your mentioning Kappa Gamma Theta reminded me of her . " " She was one who did n't claim to be a virgin , but I thoughtp45she was pretending not to be . Whether she was or not did n't interest me . " " Do you think she was ? " " Search me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that may mean something or it may not , " said Edna . " I 'd be inclined to say it meant a lot , one way or another , " said Bill . " Yes , but what ? Except that she had a good figure and did n't mind showing it , at least when she was dead . She was very modest about it when she was alive . I never saw her fully undressedbefore I found her on the bathroom floor . " " I wonder if Frank Carlson ever saw her that way , " said Bill . " Yes , I think he did , " said Edna . " Do n't ask me why , but I thinkhe did . Let 's not talk about her any more . It 's very depressing . " " I can see how it would be , " said Bill . College was over in June and after the Fourth of July Bill Ewing accepted Eddie Noisrander 's invitation to visit him in Wingate . " I happen to know Edna will be up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , too , " said Eddie . " I happen to , " said Bill . " So July will be your last chance to see her  --  unless you get invited to the Everetts ' , and I doubt that , " said Eddie . " You seem to know an awful lot about the Everetts ' plans , " said Bill . " I guess I do , " said Eddie . " I know the Everetts . By the way , I 'm not going up to the Lake this August . I 'm going to Germany to have a look at my cousin 's brewery . Six weeks I 'll be gone . The last week in July , all of August , and the first week in September . I thought I 'd tell you , I 'll be out of the way . " " Because of Edna ? " " Because of Edna , " said Eddie . " Last summer she was kind of my girl , but that was before you entered the picture . She never had much use for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't be modest , Eddie . Ruth Velie entered the picture too , " said Bill . " Ruth would be out of the picture if Edna would have me . But Edna is too pure . Are you planning to marry Edna ? " said Eddie . " Yes , eventually , " said Bill . " You 'll make a good couple . " " Why do you say that ? " said Bill . " Do n't you know it ? You 're both Protestants , you 're both pure , you both have money . I 'm not the kind of a fellow for Edna , " said Eddie . " Is Ruth Velie a Catholic ? " " She certainly is not , " said Eddie . " She was sore as hell when she found out she 'd been screwing a Catholic . But it was too late then . One Saturday night I told her I had to be up for early Mass , and she said , Do n't tell me you 're one of those , ' and I said I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd gotten used to humping me . She was good humping , too . " " Are you planning to marry Ruth ? " said Bill . " Me marry Ruth ? She 's not that good humping  --  or maybe she is . Maybe she 's too good , with too many other guys . It 'd be funny if she ended up marrying a Catholic , but it wo n't be me . Some football player , like Stanley Nork . He 's a Catholic , but I do n't think she knows it , although he comes from Hamtramck , along with the other Polacks . I guess she thinks all Catholics are named Murphy or O'Brien . " " Well , most of them are , " said Bill . " Except those that are named Noisrander or Nork , " said Eddie . " Does Stanley Nork know about you ? " " Christ , no ! He 'd kill me . He 'd kill her , too , if he knew about me . Did you ever see those hands of Stanley 's ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Stanley could be one too , except he 's smart . " " I know . He 's studying law , " said Bill.  | " I know , and he 'll be the smartest dumb Polack in Detroit one of these days . Ruth could do a lot worse than marry him , even if she had to turn Catholic . But I do n't know if she 's that smart . She 's too fond of her humping . " " How do you come across a girl like Ruth Velie ? " said Bill . " By accident , " said Eddie . " Purely by accident . She was carrying a heavy suitcase and out of the kindness of my heart I offered to carry it for her , first noticing that she had good legs . But when she said she lived at the Pi Phi house I said , Let 's take a taxi . ' Which we did . And I made a date with her that night to go to the movies and I gave her a little feel . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I took her home that night I tried again and this time I had more success . She let me feel her cunt while she played with my dingus , and the next date we had she was all prepared . In other words , she was n't wearing any bloomers , and I was ready , too . In other words , a rubber . All because I carried her heavy suitcase . At least as far as the taxi . " His parents were surprised that Bill was going to visit Eddie Noisrander , who was not a fraternity brother and therefore not known as a particularly close friend of Bill 's ; but Mrs. Ewing thought there might be a girl behind the visit , and Mr. Ewing thought it was about time . " As long as she 's a nice girl , " said Mr. Ewing . " He 'll tell us about her when he 's ready . " Bill was not taking the Saxon . Too long a trip and Eddie Noisrander had a car of his own , a new Lozier phaeton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exams . The Ewings had to look up Wingate on the map of Michigan and found that it was roughly a hundred and twenty miles from Cleveland , more or less in the vicinity of Grand Rapids , the furniture town . Beyond that they knew nothing about Wingate or Bill 's visit , except that Eddie Noisrander had a dog called Fido . " What a ridiculous name for a dog , " said Mrs. Ewing . But as Mr. Ewing pointed out , it would have been a more ridiculous name for a horse.  |p48Fido  was a Weimaraner , too large a dog to keep at Ann Arbor , but he knew whose pet he was . He was devoted to Eddie . " You 'd think he 'd forget you between vacations , " said Bill . " Not Fido , " said Eddie . " I 'm taking him to Germany with me . He was born in Germany . I had him all the time I was at Culver , and he remembered me . I think he thinks I 'm an officer in the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm on maneuvers . But as soon as I come home it 's just as if I 'd never been away . He 's very fond of Edna and she of him . She says he 's the only dog she ever liked . Of course she never had a dog . Mrs. Everett does n't like dogs . Edna could have anything she wanted , even a pony , but she really wanted a dog . Anyway , a Weimaraner . " " I 'm going to propose to Edna . " " I thought you had . " " This is going to be a real proposal . I 'm going to ask her to quit college and marry me . Will you be my best man ? " " I 'm counting on it , " said Eddie . " When do you plan to get married ? " " First I have to tell my father and mother . First I have to get Edna 's consent , I should say . " " That 's a foregone conclusion , " said Eddie . " There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I guess not , " said Bill . " Take me around and show me Edna 's house . " " All right , I will , " said Eddie . The Lozier was a big car and rather a noisy one , and it could be heard approaching Midland Avenue , where Edna lived . " Take a look at your future mother-in-law , " said Eddie . " She 's sitting on the porch , hidden by the screen , but you can see her . " Eddie raised his hat in salute to Mrs. Everett . " Good afternoon , you old goat , " he said . " She was always against me . She 's wondering who you are , but I wo n't stop now . Say hello to the old goat , Bill , " Bill raised his hat and bowed . " Good afternoon , you old goat . I 'm going to marry your daughter , " he said . " You made me do that . "  | " You 'll do it on your own when you get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so bad , Mr. Everett , but she 's an old goat . She 's a Protestantold goat . You wo n't like her . But remember I warned you . " " I ought to stick up for her if she 's a Protestant , " said Bill . " You 'll see , " said Eddie . That night , shortly after eight o'clock , Eddie and Bill paid a call on the Everett family . Edna knew they were coming , but she pretended it was a surprise , and she introduced Bill to her father and mother as a friend of Eddie 's . " Where are you from ? " said Mrs. Everett . " Cleveland , " said Bill . " Cleveland , Ohio . Well , that 's a nice place , " said Mrs. Everett . " I do n't know many people there but I know a few . Edna has cousins living there named Schultz . " " I did n't know that , Mother , " said Edna . " You never met them , but Paul Schultz is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I visited them when you were about six or seven years of age . Your father had some business there and they put us up for four or five days . Paul Schultz was the Lutheran minister . " " That 's correct , " said Paul Everett . " Well , I ought to know it 's correct . It was my cousin he was married to , " said Mrs. Everett . " Who took care of me while you were in Cleveland ? " said Edna . " Olga did , " said Mrs. Everett . " No , that was before we had Olga , " said Paul Everett . " You stayed with the Linkletters . " " That 's right , I remember , " said Edna . " Yes , come to think of it , you did , " said Mrs. Everett . " Olga took care of you later , when your father and I spent a week in Detroit . " " Correct , " said Paul Everett . " That was when I 'd just about taken full possession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you remember . " " How well we do remember , " said Mrs. Everett . " That wasp50when Mr. Everett went into business for himself . What business are you in , Mr. Ewing ? " " I just finished getting my law degree , " said Bill . " Oh , so you 're going to be a lawyer ? " said Mrs. Everett . " That should be interesting . " " Bill is nicknamed The Judge , " said Edna . " Well , is n't that interesting ? " said Mrs. Everett . " I hope it will be , " said Bill . " Oh , I 'm sure it will be , " said Mrs. Everett . " Eddie , did n't I hearyou were off to Germany to learn the brewery business ? " " I suppose you did , " said Eddie . " Those things get around . " Edna had had enough of this conversation . " Eddie , take me fora ride in your new car . Let 's go out to the Park . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me your father bought you a Lozier , " said Paul Everett . " Does it use much gas ? " " I have n't kept track , " said Eddie . " I get about ten miles to the gallon on the Hudson . They told me I 'd get more , but I 've yet to see it . What kind of a car do you drive , Mr. Ewing ? " " Well , sir , my father has a Pierce-Arrow , " said Bill . " A Pierce-Arrow . Nobody in Wingate owns a Pierce-Arrow , " said Paul Everett . " That 's a car built to last . Seven main bearings . " " I do n't know . I have n't had much chance to drive it , " said Bill . " Well , are we going or are n't we ? " said Edna . " Do n't be out too late , Edna , " said Mrs. Everett . " The Park is no place for a young girl . A lot of the riff-raff go there . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They got in the Lozier . " How does your mother know about the riff-raff at the Park ? " said Eddie . " Oh , just an idea she 's got , " said Edna . " I do n't think she 's ever been there . " " I thought not . Somebody ought to tell her the Park is owned by the Noisrander Brewery . It 's very respectable , " said Eddie.  | " Oh , well , you know Mother , " said Edna . " By this time I ought to , " said Eddie . " Bill , can you drive a Lozier ? " " I guess so . Why ? " said Bill . " Then let me out at home and you and Edna take the car . You have something to say to Edna , " said Eddie . " I have ? What ? " " You know what , " said Eddie . " Oh , that ? All right , " said Bill . " She 's waiting to be asked , you damn fool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noisrander house , and Bill took the wheel . " That was nice of Eddie , " said Edna . " Yes , it was , " said Bill . " Are n't you going to ask me ? " said Edna . " All right , " said Bill . " First of all , will you marry me ? " " You know the answer to that . What else ? " " Will you resign from college and marry me in the fall ? " " I guess so . I do n't see why not . Any other questions ? I have to meet your father and mother , " said Edna . " That can be arranged , " said Bill . He stopped the car on the edge of town . " What are you stopping for ? " said Edna . " Does n't a man usually kiss the girl when she says she 'll marry him ? " said Bill . " I believe it 's customary , " said Edna . " That 's why I 'm stopping , " said Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edna . " The trouble is , I do n't know how to start it again , " said Bill . " Has n't it got a self-starter ? " said Edna . " The hell with it . I 'll kiss you while the motor 's running , " said Bill . " It wo n't be a very long kiss , " said Edna . " If it was the Saxon I could crank it , but these expensive cars  --  I ca n't crank this car . "  | " Just give me a kiss , a short kiss , " said Edna . " You might at least have gotten instructions on how to start the car . " " How did I know I was going to stop here ? " " I do n't think you planned this very carefully , " said Edna . " Well , I did n't . It was Eddie 's idea . " " Then let 's go back and ask him how to start the car , " said Edna . " I know . You push down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ask Eddie and be sure , " said Edna . " I would n't do that . " " " You will so do that , " said Edna . " What shall I tell him ? " " Tell him you forgot to ask him how to start the car . " " I ca n't tell him that now , " said Bill . " I have a notion not to marry you , " said Edna . " I think you have to crank it , " said Bill . " You 're not paying any attention to what I say , " said Edna . " The important thing is you said you 'd marry me , " said Bill . Bill had a job in his father 's law office that summer . He went back to Cleveland after Wingate and told his father , then his mother , that he was going to marry Edna . " But what if she 's only a sophomore ? " said his mother . " I 'm going to persuade her to quit college , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteenth of January . " " Why the fifteenth of January ? " said his mother . " It 's your anniversary . It worked out pretty well for you , " said Bill . " I did n't think you knew , " said his mother , but she was touched . " I take it Mr. and Mrs. Everett have given their consent . " " No , but they will . " " Edna must be used to having her own way , " said Mrs. Ewing . " She is , but so am I. " " Yes , I 've noticed that , " said Mrs. Ewing . " Your father is too . "  | " Somebody has to , " said Bill . " We 'll have to meet the Everetts . " " They 're nice people . Mr. Everett is a self-made man , owns a furniture factory in Wingate . He 's well off . Mrs. Everett is inclined to be bossy , but since we 'll be living in Cleveland , I do n't expect much trouble from that direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have them down here for a couple of days , and I suppose we 'll have to go up there . You and Father , that is . " Edna made the announcement to her parents at the Lake . " I 'm not going back to Ann Arbor , " she said . " I 'm going to marry Bill Ewing . " " You are ? When ? " said her mother . " On the fifteenth of January , " said Edna . " Is n't this rather sudden ? " said her mother . " No . I 've been seeing a lot of Bill at Ann Arbor and we 've made up our minds . We love each other , and there 's no use postponing it any longer . " " Not even to ask your parents ' consent ? " said her mother . " I think we ought to have some say in the matter . " " Just say yes . I 'm the one that 's getting married , Mother . " " You have n't even met the Ewings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes for them , " said Edna . " Bill has told them he 's going to marry me , and Bill 's a man who knows what he 's doing . " " Doing , Ewing , " said Mr. Everett . " Well , I happen to know who the Ewings are , even if I have n't met them . Mr. Ewing is a very prominent lawyer in Cleveland , very well thought of . " " I seem to be the only one that 's been kept in the dark , " said Mrs. Everett . " Did you know about this , Paul ? " " I had some idea , especially after Bill visited Eddie Noisrander . Let 's cut out the nonsense and give our consent . Edna 's in love with this young man , who comes of a very good family in Cleveland . It is n't as if she were going to marry some hunky . Even if shep54were , Edna would go ahead and marry him , if I know Edna . You married me when I was n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering . " " That 's all you think of , is money , " said Mrs. Everett . " No , it is n't , but I give a hell of a lot of thought to it when it comes to my daughter getting married . So do you . " And so , in the autumn of that year , the parents exchanged visits . Mr. and Mrs. Everett went to see the Ewings in September , Mr. and Mrs. Ewing went to see the Everetts in October . The Everetts spent two nights at the Ewings ' ; the Ewings spent one night at the Everetts ' . The Ewings gave a dinner party for the Everetts , the Everetts gave one for the Ewings . Mrs. Ewing , who was more accustomed to the role of hostess , took Mrs. Everett to a fashion show at Halle Brothers department store and to a Junior League luncheon at some women 's club . Bill Ewing , in his Dodge , showed the Everetts several houses he was thinking of buying for himself and Edna . Mr. Ewing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Everett to visit several furniture factories in the neighborhood , and Paul , on his own , arranged to make appointments with several furniture dealers in the Cleveland area . " Well , what did you think of them ? " said Mr. Ewing the day after the Everetts returned to Wingate . " Let 's put it this way , " said his wife . " She tried . " " Yes , I guess she tried . What did you think of him ? " " Well , he does n't contribute much to the conversation , unless you happen to be in the furniture game , " said his wife . " I never thought of it as a game , did you ? " " Not the way he plays it , " said her husband . " However , I like him better than her . She 's too refined . She wanted to be buddies with you , and she never could be as long as she lived . Thank God they live in Wingate and not in Cleveland . " " We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We can go up to Ann Arbor for a football game and break the journey that way . We can have Bill and Edna go to the game withp55us , and I 'll be able to see some of my old Deke friends . We can have dinner with the Everetts the night before , and that will be enough . " " This sounds more like a Deke reunion than a visit to the Everetts , but I 'm for it , " said his wife . " After all , we 'll have to visit them again for the wedding . " " I was thinking of just that , " said Mr. Ewing . " The less we see of Mrs. Everett , the better I like it . " The Ewings ' visit to the Everetts consisted of Ada Ewing 's havingtea with a few of Mrs. Everett 's friends , Francis Ewing visiting the furniture factory , and a dinner party for the Ewings . " Well , what do you think of them now ? " said Francis Ewing , as they got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she tried , " said Ada Ewing . " There was one nice woman at dinner , a Mrs. Linkletter . She told me a story about Edna and her pony cart that explains a lot about Edna . That girl 's used to having her own way . I hope Bill realizes that . " " Yes , because Bill 's used to having his , " said Francis Ewing . " Well , so are you . " " I would n't be much good if I did n't , and neither would Bill , " said Francis Ewing . " Well , tomorrow we 're off to Ann Arbor . " " As you planned , " said his wife . " As I planned , " said Francis Ewing . " Bill and Edna will be at the Deke house , where I have n't been since Bill was initiated . It 'll be a relief to get away from the Everetts . " " Francis Ewing , you 're a snob . " " Yes , I am , but do n't let on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of D. K. E. if they knew . I 'd have to join Psi U. " In his cracked voice he sang a few measures of the Deke song , and Ada knew that he was feeling good , alone with her and free from the Everetts , looking forward to the trip to Ann Arbor . " Ada , did you know that D. K. E. was the mother of jollity ? " " Yes , Francis , I knew it , " she said . " Come to bed . " She also knew that his physician , Leonard Fogel , had told him to take it easy , andp56what did you do with a man who had been told to take it easy ? You did what he wanted you to do , and you hoped that this time it would be all right . The mother of jollity indeed . Edna Everett Ewing , being the daughter of a furniture manufacturer , was more or less compelled to permit her father to fill the new house with samples of his product . It pleased her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everett , but Everett Chippendale and Everett Duncan Phyfe , no matter how well built , embarrassed her . " Why should that embarrass you ? " said Bill Ewing . " Because it 's fake ? Who 's likely to know the difference ? How many of our friends can tell a Duncan Phyfe reproduction from an original ? Besides , when we start having kids we wo n't want them scuffing up originals . I want chairs that you can sit in , not just admire . I do n't want to be afraid that our kids will ruin a museum piece when they come home from school and throw their books every which way . " " I think you enjoy the Mission line to please Daddy , " said Edna . " No , I like it because it 's comfortable , " said Bill . " I might gettired of it if the whole house were filled with it , but do n't forget Iwant to live on a farm . " " It 'll be all right for that , goodness knows , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm having a baby . " " For God 's sake , Edna . What a way to tell me . " " Would you rather I started knitting tiny garments ? For one thing , I ca n't knit . For another , I 'm not sure , but I 'm almost sure . Dr. Fogel is , but  --  " " What more do you want ? If Dr. Fogel is sure , this calls for a celebration . Who else knows ? " " Nobody . I 'm two months late , but that is n't proof positive . I could be wrong , and so could Dr. Fogel . It could be one of those phantom pregnancies . " " Not the way we 've been behaving , " said Bill . " Notice I said be/having , not misbehaving . I feel like buying you a present . What do you want ? " " Let 's wait and be sure before you go buying me presents , " said Edna . " I 'm sure , " said Bill . " How many periods have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , I was serious . I noticed you were n't having your period when the time came , and I began to wonder . I did n't say anything , but it 's closer to three months . " " Well , I guess you can stop counting , " said Edna . " At least you can stop counting how long it 's been since I had a period and start counting months . According to Dr. Fogel I have about six months to go . It 'll be some time early in 1914 , probably February . Is anybody'sbirthday in February ? I mean besides Washington and Lincoln and St. Valentine 's Day ? I do n't want the baby to be born on somebody 's day that I hate . Would n't that be awful , to have the baby born on the same day as somebody I did n't like ? " " It 'd be nice if it was born in March , my birthday , or May , yours , " said Bill . " When is your mother 's birthday ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The seventeenth . My father was born in October , " said Bill . " My father was born in October and my mother in July . My mother was born on the Fourth of July . Imagine having a baby when everybody 's setting off firecrackers . " " It does n't seem to have affected you . I think the worst birthday to have is Christmas Day or the day after . Nobody gives you any presents , " said Bill . " I 've decided you can give me a present now . I want you to give me your Deke pin . " " My Deke pin ? You could have had that any time , " said Bill . " Why do you want that now ? " " Because now it really means something , " said Edna.  | " It 's upstairs in my bureau drawer . I 'll get it . " " You do n't have to . I took it , " said Edna . " I wish your father could see me wearing it . I think he 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pinned it on her dress . " There , " he said . He fondled her breast . " Let 's go upstairs , " he said . " I 'm ready , " she said . " I know you are , " he said . " So am I. " She undressed and stood naked beside the bed and looked down at herself . " He 's somewhere in there , the baby . There , do you think ? " She put her hand over her navel . " Farther down , I should imagine , " said Bill . " If it 's only three months . " " " I ca n't remember whether a boy 's supposed to be high or low , " said Edna . " Maybe it 's too early to tell . But I know it 's in there . " " If it is n't , it will be , " said Bill . " But I feel sure it is . " The news that Edna was having a baby was received by Mrs. Everett as something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Edna had had intercourse with Bill , although they had been married since January . She wanted to know whether Bill had hurt her the first time he entered her , and Edna refused to tell her . " It was six months before your father could do it without hurting me . I was very small , and your father was very big , " said Mrs. Everett . " I do n't want to talk about it , " said Edna . Her mother had taken the first train to Cleveland when she heard the news . " And please , Mother , do n't act as if this were the first baby ever born . I would n't have told you if I thought you 'd come right down to Cleveland . I have n't even told Mrs. Ewing . " " Well , I should hope you 'd tell me first . " " Yes , but now I 'll have to tell Mrs. Ewing , and I would n't have had to if you had n't come all the way to Cleveland , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How is Mrs. Ewing ? I had a nice letter from her a month or so ago . She wrote me on that nice heavy writing paper . It 's very formal , but she 's that way . I mean thep59writing paper , not the letter . It 's almost the kind of paper you get wedding invitations on . Ada Ewing . Her maiden name was Bloodgood , but you knew that . That 's Bill 's middle name , too . The Bloodgoodswere an old Cleveland family . I found that out from your cousin that I visited a long time ago , Adeline Brockway Schultz , the wife of Paul Schultz , the Lutheran minister . She took to writing to me after you married Bill . I ought to go see her while I 'm in Cleveland . " " You did n't invite them to our wedding , " said Edna . " Well , no , I did n't . I did n't know if they were still alive and you lose track . But she saw in the paper where you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I answered it and that led to this correspondence . She told me all about Bill 's uncle , Mrs. Ewing 's brother . I gather the Ewings did n't think much of him . He 's been having an affair with some woman in Cleveland . " " Uncle Asa , " said Edna . " That 's right , Asa Bloodgood . He came to your wedding , and we saw him at Mr. Ewing 's funeral . He drinks like a fish . Do you ever see him ? " " Now and then , " said Edna . " They say it 's a good thing he has money or the nice people in Cleveland would n't pay any attention to him , " said her mother . " You mean Cousin Adeline Brockway Schultz says that . " " Yes , that 's what I said , " said her mother . " She 's my only source of information in Cleveland . By the way , Eddie Noisrander 's back . He 's been in Germany for almost a year . " " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wedding , and that was only in January . What made you think of him ? " " Asa Bloodgood . The two are very much alike . " " Yes , they both have the same kind of car , a Lozier , " said Edna . " That 's not exactly what I meant , but you 're not fooling me , Edna , " said her mother . " I hear tell he 's going back to Germany to live . "  | " Well , why not ? He has relations there . " " You always had a soft spot in your heart for Eddie , I never knew why . " " You were n't supposed to know , " said Edna . " I mean even before he introduced you to Bill . You always hada soft spot for him . Well , there 's no accounting for tastes . " " Truer word was never spoken , " said Edna . " If you do n't mind , Mother , I 'm going to take a nap . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When I was carryingyou I used to often wish I could take a nap . I put on twenty pounds when I was having you , although you only weighed seven and a half pounds at birth . Get all the rest you can . " " I intend to , " said Edna . It was harsh to think of her mother as a bore , and it was snobbish to admire Mrs. Ewing for all the things her mother was not , but that was the way it was  --  and had been for a long time . Her mother was a small-town gossip who thrived on bits of misinformation and half truths , made to seem more viciousby the fact that they could not be completely denied , nor , for that matter , wholly admitted . In her small-town way she was masterfulat innuendo . The next day Mrs. Everett took the noon train back to Detroit and proceeded to Wingate . She told her husband how glad Edna had been to see her , how pleased Edna was that she was having a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to have dinner with her . Bill , it appeared , was having dinner with a client from Dayton and had to spend the evening with him . But he had had breakfast with Mrs. Everett , and looked fine , and sent his regardsto Paul Everett . He hoped she would let Edna and Bill know when she was coming to Cleveland again . That would be sometime around the birth of the baby , probably February , although you never could tell with a first child . " I was thinking we might go to Cleveland for Christmas , " said Paul Everett . " No , let them have their first Christmas together , " said his wife . " Edna 's very particular about that . I was too . "  | " You were ? I thought we spent our first Christmas with your parents , " said Paul Everett . " Oh , no . We only had Christmas dinner with them . Do n't you remember ? " " I guess so , " said Paul Everett . He always said " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement that he had some reason to doubt . It saved argument , or argufying . Argufying was generally a waste of time , whether with a customer or your wife . The point was that Edna wanted to be alone with Bill on this , their first , Christmas , and that spoke well for their marriage . He could sneak in a trip to Cleveland to call on one of those furniture dealers he had met when he and his wife had visited Francis and Ada Ewing . It might not be necessary to take his wife along . After all , she had gone to Cleveland without him . Edna 's baby was born on the first of February , and it was a boy . She was in labor about four hours and Dr. Fogel was with her all the time , urging her to bear down and keeping up a running conversation with her to divert her from the pain without giving her an anaesthetic . " You can do it , you can do it , " he kept saying . " It wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll put you to sleep , but it 's better this way . It 's better for Baby . It 's always better for Baby this way . You 're a good girl , Edna , and I want you to have a fine baby . " " Please put me to sleep , Doctor , " said Edna . " I ca n't stand any more . " " All right , I will , in just a moment , " said Dr. Fogel . But he waited until the baby was born and the cord was cut and the water-break occurred , and natural exhaustion set in . " Let me see my baby , " she said , and then she slept , and when she awoke Bill was at the foot of the bed . " I was expecting to be in the hospital , but I 'm not , " she said . " No , you 're not , " said Bill . " Why are n't I in the hospital ? " said Edna . " We changed our minds , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Have you seen the baby ? It 's a boy , " said Edna . " I think it 's a fine baby , but I do n't know . Is it all right ? I mean , nothing wrong with it . " " You have a fine baby , Edna , " said Dr. Fogel . " I want Bill to tell me , " said Edna . " It 's a fine baby , a great baby , " said Bill . " Did he give you much trouble ? " " I guess not . Ask Dr. Fogel . I forgot to say thank you , Doctor . " " If all the mothers were as little trouble as you , I 'd be satisfied , " said Dr. Fogel . " Your pelvic structure was just right . " " Did you hear that , Bill ? My pelvic structure is just right , " said Edna . " What are we going to call the baby ? Francis , after your father ? " " No , not Francis , and not Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John . " " John ? " " My grandfather was named John . John Stewart Ewing . He was a United States senator from Ohio , and a good man . " " Oh , I remember John Stewart Ewing , " said Dr. Fogel . " He certainly was a good man . Without him there 'd have been no Nickel Plate railroad . " " I was n't thinking of that so much as other things he did , " said Bill . " He did a lot for Western Reserve , including going there . He sent my father to Ann Arbor , but that was really my father 's choice . What are we talking about ? A name for the baby . You have n't said what you 'd like to call him , Edna . " " John Stewart Ewing , of course , " she said . " Thank you , Edna , " said Bill . " I think it 's time you got some more rest , Edna , " said Dr. Fogel . " Your husband and I will be back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Edna . The baby progressed from extreme infancy and helplessness to crawling and falling and in between the usual amount of bawling ,  |p63and  for Bill and Edna the resumption of the sex relationship when the baby was three months old . " Dr. Fogel says three months will be all right , " said Edna . " Some women wait six months , but they have n't got the pelvic structure I have . You 're lucky . I 'll bet Ruth Velie did n't have my pelvic structure . " " Ruth Velie ? What on earth made you think of her ? " said Bill . " Oh , ever since the baby was born I 've been thinking of girls and their pelvic structure . " " Then tell me what it means , " said Bill . " I guess it means wide hips , " said Edna . " Then why do n't they say wide hips ? Your hips are n't so wide . I think it means something else , " said Bill . " I wonder what ever happened to Ruth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stanley Nork . " " The Polack football player ? Did she turn Catholic ? " " She must have . We got an announcement of the wedding , in St. Somebody 's Church , Hamtramck . " " Why did n't you tell me ? " said Bill . " It slipped my mind . We only got an announcement of the wedding , not an invitation . I did n't invite her to our wedding . I did n't invite Stanley Nork either . " " There 's no reason why you should have invited him , but she was sort of a friend of yours , was n't she ? " said Bill . " She was not , " said Edna . " I was kidding , " said Bill . " Well , I guess Stanley Nork knows allabout her pelvic structure by now  --  if he did n't know before . " " A lot of people knew about her pelvic structure , including EddieNoisrander . " " Did Eddie Noisrander ever know anything about your pelvic structure ? " said Bill . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask such a question ? " " I always wanted to know , so I thought I 'd ask , " said Bill . " Well , this was no time to ask , " said Edna.  | " I 'm sorry , Edna . I had to ask you . " " No you did n't , " she said . " Just when I was glad about our three months being up you had to go and ask a question like that . " " You 're not going to ? " " Not going to what ? " " You know what , " said Bill . " No , I do n't feel like it , " said Edna . " Then I 'm going to sleep , " said Bill . " Goodnight . " He turned out the light and they lay there in the dark for ten minutes , twenty minutes . Then she spoke . " Bill ? " " What ? " " The three months are up , " she said . He got into bed with her and she made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more talk about Eddie Noisrander and there would be no more until late that summer , and this time Edna brought up Eddie 's name . " I heard the most extraordinary thing about Eddie Noisrander , " she said . " I had a letter from Mother today , and Eddie has joined the German army . Do you believe it ? " " He 's in Germany , so I do n't see why not , " said Bill . " He could have joined the German army . He 's an American citizen , but they take American citizens , or I guess they do . " On that point it developedthat Eddie had changed his citizenship some months ago . " I do n't quite see Eddie Noisrander in a spiked helmet , but I do see him going after those Belgian girls . Eddie went to Culver , you know , and I suppose there 's always been a strong militaristic streak in him . " " Yes , come to think of it , he always wore his Culver uniform at Christmas vacation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten that , " said Edna . " I hope we 're not going to send John to a military school . Are we ? " " Andover , or Exeter . " " And Ann Arbor ? "  | " We 'll wait and see , " said Bill . " He 's not yet a year old . He may want to go to M.I.T. " " Well , I 'm glad he 's not going to a military school , " she said . " I liked the Black Horse Troop , but that 's because I like horses , " said Bill . " And who knows ? John may not even like horses . My father liked them , but he did n't have the time to enjoy them . He spent all that money on the farm , but just about the time he was getting ready to enjoy it he died . That 's not going to happen to me " The farm was about ten miles from Cleveland , accessible by motorcar only , therefore not accessible in bad weather , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the West . Francis Ewing had always been a city boy , with a city boy 's fondness for farm life , and the Ewing farm had grown from i6o acres to twice that , through the purchase of neighboring land . The manager of the farm , Lloyd Sharpe , had gone to work for Francis Ewing when it became a zoo-acre establishment , and Lloyd was just out of Ohio State . " Hiring Lloyd was the smartest thing I ever did , " said Francis Ewing . " I wo n't say he saved me any money , but maybe he did in the long run . I 'm not a farmer , and Lloyd is . I 'm a lawyer with an expensive hobby , and Lloyd keeps me from letting it get out of hand . What 's more , I can sleep at night without worrying about the farm as long as Lloyd is in charge . " Ada Ewing was a city girl without the city boy 's fondness for farm life until Francis Ewing gave her permission to build a house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Francis Ewing foresaw more frequent visits to the country when Ada had a place to show her friends . " How much can I spend ? " said Ada . " I made twenty-five thousand dollars from the cash register people , " said Francis Ewing . " And I can have that ? Twenty-five thousand ? " said Ada . " That sounds like a lot of money , but not when you 're building a house in the country . You 'll spend it , " said Francis Ewing.  | " What kind of a house shall I build ? " " I 'll leave that entirely up to you . Just remember that it 's to be a farmhouse , not a stone mansion , " said Francis Ewing . " You could n't build a stone mansion for twenty-five thousand , " said Ada Ewing . She chose the site , not far from a stream , and she chose an architectwhom Francis had never heard of . He was a young Pole , a serious-minded man whom she had met at concerts of the orchestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her second meeting with him she learned that he was an architect , and on her third meeting with him she told him of her plan to build a house . Would he do as she said , and not try to force his ideas on her ? " You 're paying me  --  and besides , you do n't know what my ideas are , " he said . His name was Anthony New . " That does n't sound Polish , but I 'm Polish . My real name is too full of c 's and z 's , and you would n't remember it , " he said . " Who 's going to live in this house ? " " My husband and my son and I. The boy is getting ready to go to Ann Arbor the year after next , to study law . " " Oh , you 're that Ewing . I was n't sure , " said Anthony New . " You could have asked me , " said Ada . " I did n't want to ask too many questions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , you have it , " said Ada Ewing . They drove out to the site in her Pierce-Arrow , the predecessor of the succession of Pierce-Arrows in the Ewing family , and she told him what she wanted . " We 're going to build a dam when the house gets finished , " she said . " Why not start building it now ? " " I suppose that makes sense , " said Ada . " Everything I say makes sense , Mrs. Ewing . I hope you 're not going to cut down those sycamores . " " Not any more than I can help , " said Ada Ewing . " That 's good , " he said . " Can you read blueprints ? " " Yes , I suppose so . "  | " I 'll have blueprints for you in two weeks . " " Two weeks ? Is n't that an awfully short time ? " " We 're not very busy , Mrs. Ewing , " he said . " Why did you think I was a musician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was introduced to you by a musician . Is n't that logical ? " said Ada Ewing . " I guess so . I should have known who you were . Mrs. Francis Ewing . But somehow I never connected you with the lawyer . I never connected you with anybody . I thought you were just a lady who liked to go to the concerts by herself . " " I do n't always go by myself , " said Ada . " I never saw you with anybody , except that one time with George Barr , and he was n't sitting with you . It was a lucky thing for me you knew George , otherwise I would n't have got this job . " " Well , let 's hope it will be lucky for both of us . You say you 'll have the blueprints in two weeks ? " " I 'll have them . Could you advance me fifty dollars ? " " Of course . " " I hate to ask you for this , but I 'm short of cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her in two weeks , and they were what she wanted . " These are exactly what I wanted . How did you know ? " " I studied you , " he said . " I 'm very pleased . I thought it would take months . I have a few changes I want made , but they wo n't be drastic . " " I expected some changes , Mrs. Ewing . Could I have another fifty dollars ? " " Certainly . More , if you like , " said Ada Ewing . It was decided that they would drive out to the site every day , five days a week , in the afternoon , and this they did . Within a month the house was taking shape . Even the plumbing and wiring were progressing , and within two months the house was ready for occupancy . " I do n't see how we did it in such a short time , but youp68were there to keep an eye on the workmen , and that helped , " said Ada . " And they knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building contractor did n't give me any trouble , and I hope I did n't give you any trouble . " " You did n't . I 'm very grateful to you . My husband will be too . He was sure it would take a lot longer . " " It probably would have if he 'd been around giving orders . " " I made him stay away , " said Ada Ewing . They were walking through the house , its walls and floors bare , and there was not even a campstool for her to sit on . The sound of their slow footsteps echoed as they walked , but they were alone in the house . " What 's your husband like ? " said Anthony New . " What 's he like ? I 've been married to him for eighteen years and I 've never been asked that question , " said Ada Ewing . " How often do you go to bed with him ? " " Well , that is a question , is n't it ? And I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why ? Are you afraid to answer it ? I used to wonder why you went to concerts by yourself . It 's unusual for a pretty woman  --  or handsome . I 'd call you handsome rather than pretty . " " Suddenly the conversation has taken a decidedly personal turn . " " Why not ? There are a lot of things I want to ask you , and I wo n't get much more chance to . " " Not after this conversation you wo n't , " said Ada . " I 've always liked older women . I guess you must be around thirty-eight or forty , but you have a young figure . Did you have any feelings for me ? Do n't answer that . You 'll lie to me . But I know you have had desires for me . I 've had them for you . " " It 's a pity you could n't keep them to yourself . Anthony , it 's time we were leaving . " " No , I do n't want to leave . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first to fuck you in this house , " he said . " Do n't use that word , " said Ada.  |p69He  put his arms around her , trying to force her to kiss him . " Somebody 'll see you , " she said , resisting him , but he was strong . He put his hand on her breasts , and when she fought him off there he put his hand under her skirt . " Anthony , stop . Stop it , I tell you . " She broke away from him and went to a corner of the bare room . " We ca n't do it here anyway , " she said . " Where can we ? " " I do n't know , but we ca n't here , " she said . " Walter will see us . The painters . " " Then play with my cock , " he said . " They 'll still see us , " she said . " We can go in a closet . They wo n't see us there , " said Anthony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to continue the struggle , and she went with him to the closet . She had never known a man like him , but she knew that nothing would stop him now . " What do you want me to do ? " she said , when the closet door was closed . " What can we do ? " He opened his trousers , and his penis was hard and large . " Play with it , " he said . " Put it in your mouth . " " No , " she said . " I 'll play with it , but I wo n't put it in my mouth . " " Then jerk me off , " he said . She put her hand on his penis and stood beside him and pulled it back and forth as they both watched . When finally he came he would not let her stop until the penis became limp . " Is that all ? " she said . " That 's all , you cunt , " he said . She used her handkerchief to wipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handkerchief and the juice was everywhere . " Give me your handkerchief , " she said . " You 've made a mess . " " I did n't make it , you made it , " he said . " Are we finished now ? " she said . " If we are , let 's go back to the car . I have to go home . " She picked up the handkerchiefs , sticky with his juice , and put them in her pocket . " What are you going to do with them ? " he said.  | " Do n't speak to me , " she said . " I have nothing to say to you . I 'll let you out at your office and I 'll mail you a cheque . " On the ten-mile ride back to Cleveland she maintained her silence , and he broke it to say , " What about the fence ? Shall I send you some sketches ? " She did not answer him . At his office he got out of the car and she did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go home now . " " Yes , ma'am , " said Walter . " He was n't very talkative today . He usually talks a blue streak . " Francis Ewing was home when she got there . " Come on upstairs , " she said . It was an invitation to bed . " Upstairs ? All right . I 'm feeling a little that way myself , " he said . " Cinq a sept , as the French say . " " I 'll be with you in a minute , " she said . There were some handkerchiefsshe had to rinse out , and a curious feeling of guilt that she hoped to absolve . None of what had happened at the farm was her fault , but Anthony New had called her handsome and she had accepted the compliment . There was a certain obligation for an accepted compliment . In bed , with Francis , she was willing to doit what she had refused to do with New , who had paid her the complimentin the first place , but Francis Ewing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He suspected nothing , and what was there to suspect ? What was there to suspect ? She had resisted New , and successfully . The young man had not really touched her , had not even seen her breasts nor the other part of her that counted . But how would Francis Ewing behave if he were to know what she had actually done ? It was almost worse than if she had got down on the floor and permitted Anthony New to go inside her . There was a degree of intimacy to what she had actually done that was somehow worse than if she had gone the limit , as though the pleasureshe had given New had been a peculiar pleasure for her . And therein lay the feeling of guilt , for there had been pleasure in it for her . No one could know this , least of all Anthony New , but inp71the weeks that they had been working together the young man 's presence was vital and real . It had to end with some such contact as the incident in the closet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always had , but there was room inside her mind for thoughts of Anthony New . " Oh , that was good , " said Francis Ewing . " I enjoyed it , " said Ada . " Better than a cup of tea , any time , " said her husband . He was cheerful and totally unsuspecting . The next day she telephoned Anthony New . " This is Ada Ewing , " she said . " I 'm sorry for what happened yesterday , " he said . " Then let 's forget it . I want you to send me the drawings of the fence , " she said . " Put them in the mail as soon as they 're finished . " " Does that mean you 're not going to see me again ? " said Anthony New . " It just means we still have work to do , " she said . " You forgive me , then ? " " I do n't think I can ever forgive you , but we have work to do . Put the drawings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch with you , " she said . Now she had a strong desire for him and the best part of it was that the desire would last as long as she wanted it to , and she could not tell how long that would be . The farmhouse was completed and the furniture installed , and Francis Ewing suggested that they give a party , a housewarming , which seemed like a good idea to Ada . But she had second thoughts on the housewarming , and she postponed the party until time passed and they had lived in the house so long that the immediacy of a housewarming slowly vanished and Francis Ewing forgot about it . One day , months after the habit of going to the farm was well upon them , he remembered . " We were going to give a housewarmingat the farm , " he said . " It 's too late now , but what ever happened to that idea ? "  | " Oh , I thought of it , " said Ada . " I even made a tentative list for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show , especially for a simple house in the country . " " I think you 're right , " said Francis Ewing . " Well , it 's too late now . " " People would think they had to bring presents , and they 'd be the wrong kind of presents , " continued Ada . The truth was she had not wanted to invite Anthony New to the housewarming , and she had not seen a way to have a housewarmingwithout inviting the architect . She mailed him his final cheque , with a note informing him of that fact , and carefully refrainingfrom any personal touch . With that note she hoped that there would be an end to her memories of the incident in the closet , and to make sure , she stopped going to the concerts . It was perhaps a year later that she had a carpenter knock out the walls of the closet to make more room for the grand piano in the livingroom . Now Anthony New could come back to the house and not even find the closet . Except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the farm , and when Lloyd Sharpe was hired as the manager she took a greater interest in it . Lloyd Sharpe was the son of a downstatefarmer , a husky man with a small wife he had met at Ohio State , who raised Plymouth Rocks . There was a lot of paper work to be done by the Sharpes ; Lloyd kept notes on everything , so that at night he was often up as late as ten o'clock with the never-ending records of planting and fertilizing and harvesting of the crops , while his wife Beulah was busy with the records of her poultry and her truck garden . The Sharpes were the true farmers on the property , and Francis Ewing had the good sense to stay out of their way . Ada Ewing would often go out to the farm unaccompanied by Francis , and she wondered why . She had come to know the names of the stock  --  those that had names  --  and she followed the progress of their breeding habits . Francis Ewing had bought a prize bullp73named Nobleman of St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use as the founder of his herd , and when the bull sired his first calf it was an important event . " Nobleman had a heifer , " she said . " He should have had a young bull . " " Heifers turn into cows , Mrs. Ewing , " said Lloyd Sharpe . " And we want to see how rich this heifer 's milk 's going to be . " " Oh , I was thinking how pleased Mr. Ewing would have been , " said Ada . " I 'm more interested in the cow 's butterfat , " said Lloyd Sharpe . " Bulls are all right , but you need cows for milk . Mr. Ewing is the only Jersey breeder in the Valley , and he 's anxious to make a showingwith this heifer . It 's his first , and it 'd be nice if this heifer turned out well . " " That 's true , " said Ada . She looked at Lloyd Sharpe and thought of Anthony New , and she began to understand why she came to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad back and overalls , was the picture of virility , but he would never dream of doing to her what Anthony New had done . But the presence of so much vigor renewed her desire for a man , any man , and she would return to Cleveland and Francis Ewing re-stimulated . She had been married to Francis Ewing for many years when the scene in the closet with Anthony New took place , and their love-making depended on Francis Ewing 's need but not on hers . Twice a week  --  usually on Sunday morning was a predictable time  --  Francis Ewing would come into her bed and fondle her breasts , and if her pessary was not in place he would wait for her to put it in . But passion and spontaneity had been lacking . But then they almost always were lacking for her ; passion had come slowly to Ada Ewing , and experimentation was limited to Francis Ewing 's sucking of her breasts . Fellatio and cunnilingus were never attemptedby Francis and Ada Ewing , and the episode in the closet had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen a penis except that of her husband and that of her son in his extreme youth when she bathed him . During her menstrual periods Francis Ewingp74stayed away from her , consequently the incident with Anthony New was a new experience to her . She did not know , for instance , whether it was an experience that other women had frequently or at all . Francis had never told her , and she certainly was not going to tell him about Anthony New . They never talked about such things . And yet this Polish architect , the one time he had taken any liberties with her , had had a desire for her that he showed her how to satisfy , and she wondered what she had done to invite the desire . For as the years passed she became convinced that she had done something , said something , that led Anthony New to believe that she would satisfy him . Long after her desire for Anthony New had vanished she blamed herself . Well , at least she was safe with Lloyd Sharpe . Before Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city boy , with city friends and city habits and interests . But his friends and habits and interests were formed at a time when the country influence was strong , especially upon the children of the rich . Back of the stone house that was his home stood a stable , which had four box stalls and space for two standing stalls . There was room for the victoria , the landau , the two-horse sleigh , the cutter , the runabout , and the buckboard . There were pegs for the saddles and bridles , and the various sets of single and double harness hung from the ceiling . On the second floor were the livingquarters for the coachman-chauffeur , and a hayloft . The whole stable was lighted by electricity , and there was an iron bathtub in the toilet . It was a city stable , and in its way luxurious . Bill Ewing grew up in the final stage of the horse age , and there was even a period when his father had a cow in the stable to providemilk for him , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the non-pasteurized milk , and the cow did not last . Nevertheless the horses and the experiment of the cow familiarized Bill Ewing with the use of animals and the existence of non-urban life . He was not entirely a city boy , dependent on the trolley car for transportation and on the fire department forp75his knowledge of the horse . The horse was part of his life . For the years between five and ten he had a Shetland pony , coincidentally named Prince like the pony driven by Edna in Wingate , and he too had a governess cart and a cutter , as well as a dog cart . But the pony , being a Shetland , was not for riding ; under the saddle he would put his head down and bear out or otherwise misbehave , and it was not until Bill was ten and his father bought him a larger pony that Bill learned to ride . Rex was a hackney , bought for his looks and not for the hackney action , but Bill loved him and rode him for six years until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bill had grown tall rather suddenly , had long pants and stopped wearing an Eton collar , and had taken up tennis . His friend at University School , Halsey Brodbent , was not a horseman , nor was he tall , but Bill saw him every day and sought to earn his approval . If that meant retiring Rex to the farm , so be it . There was more fun to be had with Halsey and his commentson people and his game of tennis . Halsey Brodbent was the son of a history professor at Western Reserve and as such had to watch his pennies . Halsey had three older sisters , all of whom had graduated from Bryn Mawr ; and Halsey was on his way to Harvard . " The only thing I can wear that belonged to my sisters is sweaters , " said Halsey . " That 's why I have so many sweaters . Well , I can wear Judith 's sneakers , but they have holes in them , so they 're not much good . " The Brodbents were seldom all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married to a man who taught English at Haverford ; Barbara , the second sister , was an instructor in French at the Brearley School in New York ; Judith , the only one at home , was an assistantto the dean of women at Western Reserve , and was the prettiest one . " Do you want to see Judith take a bath ? " said Halsey . " Sure , " said Bill . " How can I ? " " She wo n't mind . At least she does n't when I watch her . " " Yes , but you 're her brother , " said Bill.  | " What 's the difference ? I 'm a member of the male sex . Come to my house on Sunday morning . She spends all Sunday morning in the tub . She hardly ever goes to church , and you can just walk in the bathroom . " At ten o'clock on Sunday morning Bill showed up at the Brodbents ' house and Halsey said , " She 's been in the bathroom about fifteen minutes . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church . " " What shall I do ? I ca n't just walk in , " said Bill . " Pretend you 're going in to take a pee , " said Halsey . " But the door will be closed , " said Bill . " What if it is ? She 's seen me take a pee , " said Halsey . " I know what you can do . You can knock on the door and pretend you did n't hear her . " Bill accordingly knocked on the bathroom door and opened it without waiting for a response . Judith , her hair covered with lather , was in the tub . " Oh , hello , Bill , " she said . " Oh , I beg your pardon , " said Bill . " I did n't know you were in here . " " The hell you did n't , but go ahead and have a good look , " said Judith . " It wo n't do you any harm . " She stretched out in the tub and watched Bill 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good look ? My little brother put you up to this , did n't he ? " " Yes , " said Bill . " I mean , no " " All right , you 've had your look . Now go tell Halsey you 've seen me naked , " said Judith . " Gosh , you 're pretty , " said Bill . " Please close the door , " said Judith . He went out and down the stairs and without a word to Halsey continued on his way home . He went to his own bathroom and tried to recapture the ecstasy of seeing Judith Brodbent in her tub , and for a moment he succeeded , but then it got shameful and messy.  | " Say , you did n't stay up there very long , " said Halsey , the next day . " Long enough , " said Bill . " Let 's not talk about it . " " O.K. , I just thought you 'd like to see Judith taking a bath , " said Halsey . " I said , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you ? " " All right , do n't bite my head off , " said Halsey . Halsey Brodbent remained his friend until Harvard separated them , Ann Arbor separated them . New England and the Middle West separated them . Bill wrote to Halsey , inviting him to be an usher at his wedding and offering to furnish his railway ticket to Wingate . It came as no surprise when Halsey declined . " I will be otherwise occupied on the 15th of Jan. , " Halsey wrote . " I will not even get home for Christmas with my family . It would be easy for me to say that I am working for my master 's degree , which would be true , or that I could not afford the railway fare , which your generous offer makes untrue . But the fact is that there is a deeper reason for not wishing to be an usher at your wedding , which has nothing to do with my M.A. or my straitened finances . I have become a socialist . I do not see myself putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enjoying the parties that will no doubt be part of the festivities . I cast my first vote for Eugene Debs and Emil Seidel in November and I do not consider it a wasted vote . Time is on our side . " There were a few socialists at Ann Arbor , but they were mostly Jews and Bill hardly knew them . They were not in Deke or Psi U , the principal source of Bill 's friendships . If he had gone to Harvard , would he have turned socialist ? He thought not , not even under Halsey 's influence , strong and subtle though it was . His father 's influence was stronger and his mother 's too , and Edna 's was strongest of all . By the simple act of giving him a baby Edna established herself as his breeding partner , his successful breeding partner and more than simply his wife . She possessed the magic of reproduc/tion , and John Stewart Ewing was there to prove it . The infant child at his mother 's breast  --  Edna had milk for him  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would try to get home from the office every afternoon to watch the baby being fed , and he would sit silent during the ceremony , thinking fatherly thoughts . " Dr. Fogel says I ought to give up nursing him pretty soon , " said Edna . " In a few weeks he 'll start on formula . " " Save a few drops for me , " said Bill . " No , you do n't need it , " said Edna . " You 're a big boy now . " " There was some saint that got his milk from the breast , " saidBill . " He was in prison , and the women used to feed him thatway . " " Well , you 're not a saint  --  thank God , " said Edna . " You let me suck you when you did n't have any milk . " " That was pleasure . I 'll let you suck me again , but not while Ihave milk . This milk belongs to John-Stewart and nobody else . Do you really want to ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would n't deprive him of any nourishment . " " Besides , I 'm superstitious about it , " said Edna . " I do n't know why , but I am . " " Well , I was there before John-Stewart was , and I 'll be there again , " said Bill . " I would n't want to take a single drop of milk that belongs to him . He has to grow up big and strong . " " Like his father , " said Edna . " Oh , I hope he 'll be like you , Bill . " " I think he will be . It may be a little too early to tell , but he has my good disposition , do n't you think ? He does n't cry much . " " The only time I 've seen you cry was when your father died . " " I cried when Rex died , my pony , but that was before I knew you , " said Bill . " I 'm going to get John-Stewart a pony like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stubborn . But Rex was just right for me . " " There , that 's all for you , young man , " said Edna . She removed the baby from her breast and held him until he burped . " I 'll missp79feeding him , but Dr. Fogel thinks I 've nursed him long enough . I do n't know what we 'd have done without Dr. Fogel . " That summer and all that autumn Bill and Edna were more interested in one tiny life and the formula that Dr. Fogel recommendedto sustain it than in the destruction and blood-letting that was reported from Europe . " What do you say we go up to Ann Arbor for a game ? " said Bill . " We have n't been there since graduation . " " If we go to a game , we 'll have to go to Wingate , " said Edna . " We have n't been there , either . " " Then I guess that rules out Ann Arbor , " said Bill . " I just thought it would be fun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't care about the game . Which reminds me , I wonder how Eddie Noisrander is getting along in the war . " " I suppose his parents would know , " said Edna . " Do you want me to find out for you ? " " Not really , " said Bill . " Do you realize that of all the thousands of people fighting in Europe , Eddie Noisrander is the only one we know on either side ? " " Not surprising . It 's not our war , thank God . " " Well , that 's not quite true . There was a man here in Cleveland named Joplin , Philip Joplin . He was a few years ahead of me at University School , and I understand he was killed with the British . I never knew him very well , and of course you never knew him at all . He went to Oxford , or maybe it was Cambridge . One or the other . His father is getting up a memorial fund in his memory , so I gave ten dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm neutral . If I 'd have had time to think , I would n't have given the ten dollars . " " Oh , well , he was a schoolmate , " said Edna . " But a fund in his memory , in memory of a British soldier , is British propaganda . I 'll know better the next time . And there 'll be a next time . Two more boys from University School havep80joined the Canadians . One boy was in my class , the other a class behind me . The boy from my class went to Williams but he did n't graduate . I wonder how Halsey Brodbent feels about the war . Socialists are against war unless it happens to suit them , and then they do n't call it a war . I do n't like socialists . " " But you do like Halsey Brodbent . You asked him to be an usher at our wedding , " said Edna . " Yes . I asked a socialist to be an usher at our wedding and he turned me down . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer . " " Well , you had four other ushers and a best man , and they all turned out all right , " said Edna . " My marriage turned out all right , that 's what matters , " said Bill . " My best man and four of my ushers were Dekes , that 's why . " " " That 's why , " said Edna . " It 's probably as good a reason as any , " said Bill . " I 'll hit you , " said Edna . " If you do , I 'll cry , " said Bill . " If you did , I 'd cry , " said Edna . " Then do n't hit me . Would you ever hit me , really ? " " If you deserved it . If you had relations with another woman I would , " said Edna . " What ever made you think that ? " " I do n't know . I guess because I 'm so happy with you and John-Stewart . My mother is fearfully jealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to be , at least as far as I know . " " Well , do n't you go start getting jealous , " said Bill . " I never look at another woman . Oh , I look at them , but I never have any evil intentions toward them . " " Who do you look at  --  without evil intentions ? " said Edna . " Who do I look at ? " said Bill . " Be hard to say . You know Mrs. Auerbach . She was Judith Brodbent before she was married , Halsey 's sister . "  | " I 've met her . She 's a little old for you , but she 's good-looking in a bespectacled way . " " I saw her take a bath , " said Bill . " You mean in the tub ? Naked ? " " When I was about fifteen . One Sunday morning I went in the bathroom and there she was , lying in the tub and washing her hair . She told me to go ahead and have a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and masturbated . " " I 'd say you had evil intentions there , " said Edna . " I did n't do anything to her . " " You sure you did n't masturbate in front of her ? " said Edna . " I probably would have if I 'd thought of it , and had the nerve . " " Did n't she ever make any effort to see you naked ? She didn'tknow what she was missing , " said Edna . " I 've told you the whole story . She was the first woman I ever saw naked , with hair down below and breasts . She was beautiful . When I was about ten or eleven a little girl used to come to the stable and if Walter was n't there she 'd put it in her mouth . I 'd hate to tell you who that little girl turned out to be . " " Who was it ? " " None other than Alice Minzer . " " Alice Minzer ? That fat girl that 's always hanging around your mother ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was a very unattractive little girl and she has n't gotten any more attractive . But Mother puts up with her , I do n't know why . Mother puts up with a lot of unattractivepeople since my father died . I guess she 's lonely . " " Yes , she does n't seem to care any more , " said Edna . " She spends a lot of time on the farm . " " With the Jerseys , " said Bill . " At that , the Jerseys are more attractive than Alice Minzer . How old would you say Mother was ? " " In her forties , I guess . She 's never told me , and I would n't dare ask her . "  | " Do you think she 's going through change of life ? " said Bill . " I guess she must have . That 's another thing I would n't dare ask her . " " " What exactly is change of life ? " said Bill . " I was hoping you would n't ask me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to inform me . You stop menstruating , and you have these hot flashes , and I have heard that you lose all sexual desire , but on the other hand , I 've heard that when it 's over your sexual desire is as great as ever . " " You 're a woman . I thought you could help me . " " Women do n't talk much about change of life , " said Edna . " They talk about childbirth and pregnancy , and how they got pregnant . But change of life is a sort of forbidden topic . I 'm sure my mother has had it , but I would n't know it from her . Their poor husbands know , God knows . Women get depressed and havethose hot flashes and take to their beds  --  without their husbands . They even get suicidal . Life is over for them , some of them . On the other hand , there was a Mrs. Latham in Wingate , close to seventy , and she went right on menstruating . She had hardly a grey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second time when she was sixty-some , to a man in his forties . Everybody said her second husband was after her money , and he may have been . But whatever they did , they died happy . They were both killedin a train wreck , somewhere in the South . " " How did you know so much about Mrs. Latham ? " said Bill . " Well , Wingate 's a small town , and Mr. Latham was a foreman in my father 's plant , and my mother never missed a trick . " " She could n't have if she knew about Mrs. Latham menstruating , " said Bill . " Oh , that was common knowledge , " said Edna . " Everybody knew that . I remember hearing about it when I was in high school . I was just starting to menstruate and I asked Bertha Linkletter how long it went on , and she told me Mrs. Latham was still doingp83it at sixty-some . How she knew about Mrs. Latham I ca n't say , but she knew . " Their conversations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing about each other until Ann Arbor , and the first eighteen years of their lives was pristine . Nearly all of Bill 's memories were of Cleveland , nearly all of Edna 's were of Wingate . In the beginning of their romance they talked about each other , whom they saw the day before , whom they were seeing that night , immediatetopics . It was not until they had been married for a year or so that their conversational pace permitted them to reminisce , and then they discovered how much they did not know about each other , the years of childhood and adolescence . " I was very unpopular when I was fourteen , " said Edna . " The worst of it was , I knew it , and I did n't try to change myself . I 'd never let Bertha Linkletter drive my pony , although she was dying to . She used to beg me to let her take the reins , but I would n't let her . In fact , we had a falling out for that reason , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked to drive Prince I told her a lie , I said Daddy had forbidden me to let anyone else drive . Right away Ann asked Daddy if it was all right if she drove , and he said of course . I hated to be caught in a lie . " " That 's the trouble with ponies . Everyone else wants to drive , " said Bill . " I 've often wondered why I was so mean , " said Edna . " I was n't that mean about clothes when I went up to Ann Arbor . I had a squirrel coat that I let everybody wear , and I loved that coat . I had a blue evening dress that I spent forty-five dollars for , and by the time I got to wear it everybody thought it was borrowed . But believe me , I was the only one that could touch the reins of my pony . I guess I was more sure of myself at Ann Arbor than I ever was in Wingate . We were n't the richest people in Wingate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton Whitehilland he owned a lot of timberland and some copper mines ,  |p84and  she was the social leader of the town . It was a great disappointment to me they did n't come to our wedding . They were traveling in Europe . But at least they sent us a wedding present , that silver tea service , the one from Tiffany 's in New York . So I guess Mrs. Whitehill approved of me . Mr. Whitehill liked my father , but I never heard Daddy call him anything but Mr. Whitehill . The Whitehills of Wingate . They gave a party every Fourth of July and nobody missed that . The first year I was invited I could n't go because we were married and living in Cleveland and I 'd just gotten pregnant , but my mother made sure people knew we were invited . Mr. Whitehill was the only Yale man in Wingate . He had a son graduated from Yale , but J. Clinton Junior lived in New York City . He was a lot older than I was , at least ten years . J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere in New Hampshire , and I ca n't say I ever knew him . He married a girl from Long Island right after he got out of Yale , and they have a country estate there . It 's funny how New York attracts some people from the Middle West . The only thing that would get me to live there is if you had taken that job with Mr Clendenning . " " Are you glad I did n't take that job ? " said Bill . " I would have been miserable in New York . " " But you 're not miserable in Cleveland , I hope , " said Bill . " No , here there are n't a lot of people dropping their is and talking in that affected way . I 'll bet that was one of the reasons why you turned it down . " " It may have been . I never thought of that , " said Bill . " I know I 'm better off where I am . Four or five years from now I 'll be taken into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My name is in small type now , to distinguish me from my father , the original Ewing of Hotchkiss , Ewing and Kelley . Bob Hotchkiss is in small type too , to distinguish him from his father , Arthur Hotchkiss . And Clarence Kelley is the only original partner still alive . He outlived both his partners . "  | " You never hear of Mr. Kelley , " said Edna . " Oh , yes you do . Other lawyers hear of old Clarence . They hear about him plenty , and that 's where it counts . It 's about time you had Mr. Kelley for dinner . I think he 's lonely . Ever since his wife died , which must have been ten years ago at least , he 's been living at the Union Club , and that must be pretty lonely . His two daughters are married . One lives in Pittsburgh , married to a doctor , and the other is married to a theatrical producer and lives in New York . I hear they 're not getting along so well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can do about it . She has taken to drink , so I 'm told , and that 's bad because Mr. Kelley 's wife died of it . Mrs. Kelley was a loud-mouthed woman , the exact opposite of Mr. Kelley , and my mother could n't stand her . She said awful things about my father and of course they all got back to him . I was in the office one day , waiting for my father to take me to the ball game , and Mr. Kelley came in and said he owed my father an apology . My father tried to stop him because I was there , but Mr. Kelley said I was old enough to understand . I did n't quite understand but he went on anyway . Apparently Mrs. Kelley had blamed my father for losing a lawsuitthat involved a case in the Supreme Court  --  the case of U.S. versus Ingersoll , which became famous , and which my father defended . I wo n't go into it now , because it was a complicatedcase , but the Court ruled against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote one of his dissenting opinions on it , which would seem to show that my father had made a good case . Be that as it may , Mr. Kelley was there to apologize for something his wife had said the night before , and my father had n't even heard about it . He would have in time , but he had n't then . I will never forget how upset Mr. Kelley was . If you want my resignation , you have it , ' Mr. Kelley said . And my father said , Well , Clarence , I lost the case , so maybe I 'm the one to resign . ' My father was like that . Never a word about Mrs. Kelley or her foolish accusation . You have to excuse me now , ' he said . I'mp86taking Bill to the ball game . ' Mr. Kelley remembered that at my father 's funeral . He really loved my father . " " When shall we have him for dinner ? " said Edna . " Friday 'd be all right . He eats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't I ask your mother and maybe one other couple ? " said Edna . Ada Ewing , though considerably younger than Clarence Kelley , was delighted to join him for dinner , along with the Bob Hotchkisses . The men wore their Tuxedos , the women dressed accordingly , and it was rather a festive gathering , with cocktails and wine . " I was just thinking as I sat down , what good-looking women the firm of Hotchkiss , Ewing and Kelley have picked for wives , " said Clarence Kelley . " Beginning with Ada , and then there was Frannie Hotchkiss and my wife , Doro . And now we have Edna and Priscilla Hotchkiss . I venture to say we 'd stack up against any other law firm in the country in that regard . " " Hear , hear , " said Bill Ewing . " I therefore propose a toast : to the ladies of Hotchkiss , Ewing and Kelley . " " The ladies , " said Bill and Bob Hotchkiss . " And I too propose a toast , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is and always has been , a gentleman and a scholar and a heck of a man to oppose in a lawsuit . " " Hear , hear , " said they all . Priscilla Hotchkiss stood up . " You , Priscilla ? " said her husband . " Yes , me . I thought you were leaving out two men that I think ought to be mentioned and that we all love . I refer to Francis Ewing and Arthur Pinkham Hotchkiss , better known as Aph . To them ! " There was not a bit of business discussed all evening , and when eleven o'clock came Clarence Kelley looked at his watch and said , " Ada , I 'm sure your faithful Walter is waiting in the PierceArrow , and if you 'll give me a lift I 'll go quietly . Much as I hatep87to put an end to this lovely party , old men and infants have to retire early , you know . " He and Ada Ewing said goodnight all around and departed . " I think the old boy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be lonely as sin at the club . " " It would be if he had nothing to do , " said Bob Hotchkiss . " But as soon as he gets to the club he 'll get into his pajamas and read till two or three o'clock in the morning . He told me he only needs about four hours ' sleep . " " Like Edison , " said Bill . " Yes , the summer I lived at the club he followed more or less the same routine . He used to play bridge or billiards till about ten-thirty or eleven , and then retire . That was when he told me he only needed four hours ' sleep . He told me he was reading Caesar 's Commentaries in the original Latin . Now he must be reading something else , but it 's sure to be something in Latin or the original Greek . " " Greek ? " said Priscilla . " He reads Greek , Latin , and French , " said Bob Hotchkiss . " He wakes up about six o'clock in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee and he bathes and shaves and walks to the office . He 's usually the first there . He wo n't have a car because he 'd be tempted to do without his walk . " " I never knew any of this about Clarence Kelley , " said Bill . " That 's because you never spent a summer at the club , " said Bob Hotchkiss . " He 's an entirely different man there . Friendlier than at the office . At least friendlier then he would be with us young squirts . " " He was friendly enough this evening , " said Edna . " He was indeed , " said Bob . " He showed a side of him that I never saw at the club , but that was because there were ladies present . " " He was being courtly , gallant , " said Edna . " Bill , was he ever in love with your mother ? "  | " Not that I know of , but he could have been , " said Bill . " Then I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , he was in love with your mother , but your mother was n't in love with him . One night at the club he began talking about love . I do n't know why or how we got on the subject . Sometimes when we were the only ones having dinner there , which was fairly often during August , he 'd launch into a topic that had no connection with legal matters . I had the feeling that he was sounding me out , to see how I felt about this and that . In any event , the topic that night was love , and he started to tell a story about a man he knew in his fifties , who thought that he was all through with romantic interests . The man had had an unhappy marriage , but it was too late for him to get a divorce . He 'd been married twenty-five years , and he thought he was through with romance . But he was n't . The wife of a friend of his , a very close friend , a younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something that her own husband could n't help her on . The two of them were thrown together fairly frequently , and the man came to the realization that he was in love with the woman . After twenty-five years of marriage to his wife , and maybe ten years that the woman had been married to his friend , he realized that this was the real thing . The only trouble was , the woman was still in love with her husband . That did n't stop him from trying to have an affair with her , and for the next year or two he made a nuisance of himself , asking her to go away with him , things like that . It was l'dge dangereux for the man , and when Clarence Kelley used the French expression I identified the man . It was , of course , Clarence Kelley himself , and the woman was your mother . It all fitted together .

There 's a lot more to the story than what I 've told you , but I wonder if he did n't mean that when he told your mother he 'd go quietly . It was such an extraordinarything to say otherwise . I guess it 's not much of a story . " " It tells you a lot about Clarence Kelley , " said Edna . " And about Mrs. Ewing , " said Priscilla Hotchkiss . " But more about Mr. Kelley . That poor , lonely man , living in his club and spending his nights reading Greek , " said Edna . " Well , what should my mother have done ? Had an affair with him ? " said Bill . " She was in love with my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You were n't supposed to . " " Time to go home , Bob , " said Priscilla . " Do n't go away mad , " said Edna . " Are you playing golf with me tomorrow ? " said Bob Hotchkiss . " Ten o'clock , but I still did n't like your story , " said Bill . After the Hotchkisses had gone Bill was silent as he undressed . " What 's the matter with you ? You might say something niceabout my party , " said Edna . " It was your idea . " " I honestly believe you think my mother should have had an affair with Clarence Kelley . " " I do n't think any such thing , but I feel sorry for him , " said Edna .

He was only a clerk there , making slow progress , because that was the way of the firm . He had not yet passed his bar examinations , and his first task of any importance was the drafting of two minor wills . The clients were two young men , friends of his who had not come into any considerable fortunes of their own , but thep90possibility of their dying intestate was abhorrent to lawyers , and they agreed to make a will despite the small size of their estates . It was also good training for Bill Ewing , who drafted the wills under the supervision of Clarence Kelley . There was an error of omission in the first will which Clarence Kelley quickly pointed out , but the second will had no mistakes . " I see you do n't make the same mistake twice , " said Clarence Kelley . " You ought to be ready for your bar exams fairly soon .

He decided to have a talk with his mother , and he dropped in on her after work . " Mother , you and I have always been straightforward with each other , and I have a question to ask you that you may not like . " " That means you want a straightforward answer ? " said Ada Ewing .

I suppose I must have done something , or maybe even not done something . One can be as bad as the other in a case like that . You must remember that Clarence was a lonely man , even then . His wife was no help to him at all . She was a noisy woman , who not only drank quantities of gin but used laudanum , a polite way of say/ing opium . You can imagine what effect that had on Clarence , with his two daughters away at school and Clarence trying to be both mother and father to them . Mrs. Kelley was a mess . I would have put her away . And that 's what made him think he was in love with me . He came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was n't very good at that because I never liked Mrs. Kelley . She was a handsome woman , although by the time you knew her she 'd lost her looks . If ever a man had a cross to bear , it was Clarence Kelley , and he misunderstood my sympathy . Eventually , finally , I had to tell him that your father was beginning to misunderstandit too , and not entirely without reason . I remember your father saying to me , Are n't you seeing a little too much of Clarence ? ' So I stopped seeing him . The other night when we had dinner at your house was the first time I 'd been alone with him  --  on the way home in the car  --  since I stopped seeing him , fifteen or twenty years ago . I do n't know who told you about Clarence Kelley and me  --  probably Bob Hotchkiss , who probably heard it from his mother . But it does n't make any difference now . Clarence respected my unwillingness to see him , and that dreadfulwife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think he enjoyed himself the other night . He 's old now , and lonely , but he was full of charm . I 've often wished I could do more for him , but your father always came first with me , and that did n't leave room for anyone else . " She was silent as she thought back on the years past . She did not even make his question a difficult one to answer . " I had n't really thought of Clarence Kelley until the other night , " she said . " I gave him a ride to the club and he held my hand , and when we got to the club he kissed me on the cheek , and that was the first time he 'd ever kissed me . I was glad he did . A lonely life , he leads , but I suppose I might as well get used to a lonely life . " She looked at her son . " Well , what else is on your mind ? " " I guess that 's all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it time you got home for dinner ? " she said.  |p92She  saw him to the door and put up her cheek to be kissed , but he was sure she wanted to be alone . The letter came informing William Bloodgood Ewing that he had passed the bar examinations in the same mail that a letter came from Wingate informing him that Eddie Noisrander had been wounded in action on the Western Front . The letter was signed by Eddie 's father , Emil Noisrander . " Knowing you were a friend of Edward 's I am passing on this information , " it said , and it was typed and had a secretary 's initials on the bottom , and obviously it was a form letter . It said nothing about the nature or degree of Eddie 's wound or about his condition or the date of his injury . Both letters were at home when Bill returned from work . " You have a letter from Columbus and one from Wingate . The one from Wingate is from Noisrander 's Brewery , " said Edna . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbus is . " " Open it and just tell me , yes or no , " said Bill . She opened it and said , " Yes , " and she kissed him . " Congratulations , although I do n't think you had a thing to worry about . But you 're a lawyer now , a full-fledged lawyer . " " Not quite , but I 'm a lawyer in the State of Ohio , " said Bill . He opened the letter from Emil Noisrander and handed it over to Edna . She read it carefully . " Poor Eddie . Such a waste , " she said . " It does n't say he was killed , " said Bill . " It does n't really say anything except that he was wounded . It does n't say what hospital he 's in or anything about his condition . There is n't anything we can do except write to Mr. Noisrander . I met him when I was staying with Eddie , the summer before I graduated . I met him twice . At Commencement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a friend of Eddie 's . " " Well , are n't you ? He introduced us , " said Edna . " Yes , he 's a friend of mine , but with reservations . He joined the German Army when he did n't have to , and the more I think ofp93what the Germans are doing , the less I 'm on their side . As someonesaid the other day , we 're neutral  --  on the side of the Allies . The Lusitania was just about the last straw . A thousand lives lost , over a hundred of them Americans . " " But she was supposed to be carrying munitions , " said Edna . " And what if she was ? There 's a thing called freedom of the seas . I do n't know anything about international law , or maritime law , but Germany is certainly violating the principle of freedom of the seas . Torpedoing the Lusitania is just that . Did you see what Teddy Roosevelt said about it ? He called it damnable and hellish . ' " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Edna . " A few more Lusitanias and we will , " said Bill . " Unfortunately , we 're unprepared . " " Would you get in it if we did ? " said Edna . " Of course I would , " said Bill . " Just when you passed your bar exams ? " said Edna . " That would n't keep me out . Nothing would , " said Bill . " I 'm an able-bodied citizen of the United States , and if my country gets into the war , I go in with the others . " " Well , let 's hope we stay out of it , " said Edna . " It 'll be a miracle if we do , " said Bill . " Bob Hotchkiss has joined the National Guard , that 's how he feels about it . He drills one or two nights a week , and all he talks about is the war . And do n't forget , he passed his bar exams . " " I have a feeling Bob wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Edna . " That remains to be seen , but he might make a better soldier , " said Bill . " Let 's pray for that miracle , " said Edna . " What does Clarence Kelley say about the war ? " " He does n't say much , but his son-in-law , the theatrical producerwho 's separated from his wife , has gone abroad to drive an ambulance for the French . "  | " To drive an ambulance ? Does he speak French ? " said Edna . " I assume he does . I do n't know anything about him except that he 's married to Clarence Kelley 's daughter and produces plays , or did . Offhand I could n't even tell you his name . And , yes , Clarence likes him . I can tell by the way he speaks of him . He 's seen the same thing happening to his son-in-law that happened to him . A drunken wife . His name , by the way , is Fiske , Granville Fiske . I knew it would come to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar exams . He 'll be just about at the club now . He telephoned Clarence Kelley . " Mr. Kelley , I thought you 'd like to know that I 've passed the bar exams , " he said . " How nice , " said Kelley . " I assumed that you would , but it 's nice to know . Your mother must be pleased . " " As a matter of fact , I have n't told her yet . " " Oh , you must tell her right away , " said Clarence Kelley . " You 've told Edna ? " " Yes , Edna knows , " said Bill . " She was the first to know . You 're the second . " " I 'm complimented . Now tell your mother . She 'll be very happy to hear the good news . It 's a funny thing about exams , Bill . You bone up on things like the Rule in Shelley 's Case , and then they do n't ask you that , but they ask you some simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you knew the answer , and you did n't . Probably because you had a cold at the University of Michigan . But I do n't suppose you had any colds at the Universityof Michigan . Well , tell your mother your good news . She 'll be pleased that you passed your first time around . " Bill telephoned his mother , but she was on her way home from the farm . " She spends a lot of time at the farm , " said Bill . " Thank goodness she has the farm to go to , " said Edna . Ada Ewing , in her country clothes , had become such a familiar figure on the farm that the workmen would hardly look up whenp95she joined them . " Do n't let me disturb you , " she had said in the beginning , but she had had to repeat it so often that the only man whom she disturbed was Lloyd Sharpe . A baby had been born to Beulah and Lloyd Sharpe , and another was on the way . The first child , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ada had said , " I know where the next farm manager 's coming from . " " Not Bruce , " said Beulah . " Bruce is going to be a doctor when he grows up . I set my heart on a doctor . So has Lloyd , have n't you , Lloyd ? " " That would be nice if he did , " said Lloyd . " I 'd like if he was a doctor . But it 's a little too early to tell what he 'll be . " " What if your second is a boy ? " said Ada . " Oh , my second can be a farm manager , just so my first is a doctor . Of course , it may be a girl , " said Beulah . " I would n't mind if the second was a girl , to keep me company . It 's a pretty lonesome life , being a farm manager 's wife . " " But you 're never far away from your husband , " said Ada . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he does with me , " said Beulah . " With me ? I had n't realized that , " said Ada . Later , when she and Lloyd were inspecting the stock , Lloyd said , " You must n't mind what Beulah said . The truth is she 's jealous . " " Of me ? Nonsense , she could n't be . " " Oh , you 're pretty , Mrs. Ewing , and you have personality , " said Lloyd . " But I 'm old enough to be your mother , " said Ada . " You sure do n't look it . You have n't any wrinkles . " " Look closer , Lloyd . They 're there , " said Ada . But Lloyd Sharpe had paid her a personal compliment , the first he had ever paid her and the first anyone had paid her in a long time . That evening , lying in her tub , she looked at herself in the mirror and was pleased . She was fifty-two and had been a widow for over two years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man had seenp96her , nor was any man likely to get any pleasure out of seeing or touching her , or she out of seeing or touching any man . The pleasure of touching a man had always been confined to the pleasure of touching Francis Ewing , who was dead , or the mixed pleasure of touching Anthony New , who had not even touched her . Her right hand , as she thought these things , lay on her clitoris , a moderatelypleasurable experience that she intensified until she discovered that by increasing the pressure and speed of the motion of her hand she approximated a climax . She looked down at herself , half expecting some sort of discharge like the one that she had caused years ago in Anthony New , and when there was none and she felt relaxed , she was relieved . No one in the world would know that she had found a way to get such relief . She got out of the tub and looked at herself in the full-length mirror , and saw that her nipples were erect . She wished that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would surely be somebody . At least she no longer had the feeling that she was more dead than alive . There would be somebody . Lloyd Sharpe , the nearest thing to a man in her life , was first to come to mind , and maybe he would be the one . Then she thought of all the things against his being the one : she would have to seduce him , virtually under the eyes of Beulah , and that presenteddifficulties . But the principal objection to Lloyd Sharpe was Lloyd Sharpe . He was young  --  and he was a good farm manager , and good farm managers were hard to get . Anthony New , her next thought , was young , but she did not know where he was . New York , the last she heard , working for a big architectural firm . In the years since Francis Ewing died her escorts at dinner parties were few : Clarence Kelley ; a man named Ray Bostwick , from Detroit , a recent widower ; Walter Finch , a Cleveland resident of whom Francis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Walter Finch . He plays with dolls " ; and Peter Hoff , of whom Francis Ewing had said , " He plays with dolls , too , but they 're live , baby dolls . Chorus girls and stenographers . " Peter Hoff was in the in/surance business in Columbus , but he spent a good deal of time in Cleveland , and Ada liked him . In her present lubricious mood she decided to call him . He maintained an apartment at the Cleveland Hotel . " How lucky I was to find you in , " said Ada . " Five minutes later and I 'd have been out . What can I do for you , Ada ? " " Well , you can come to a dinner I 'm having a week from Thursday . It 'll be only a few people , but I 've decided to begin to entertain . " " About time , Ada . It 's no use wasting away . A week from Thursday , you say . I 'll be in Cleveland that night , and I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter Hoff . Ada immediately invited six more people for dinner a week from Thursday and they all accepted . They were Dr. Hendricks , the heart specialist , and his wife ; Priscilla and Bob Hotchkiss ; Walter Finch , and Christine Frogg , the sculptor , who wore a Tuxedo and took an instant shine to Priscilla Hotchkiss , as did Peter Hoff . They almost sat down without Dr. and Mrs. Hendricks , who were late . They talked about the war in Europe , which did not interest Walter Finch , who amused Priscilla Hotchkiss with stories about Christine Frogg , told sotto voce . Peter Hoff wanted to eavesdrop , but Walter Finch made it difficult . Dr. Hendricks and Bob Hotchkiss dominated the war conversation and Bob Hotchkiss dominated Dr. Hendricks because he knew more about the war . Dr. Hendricks was called to the telephone at ten o'clock and had to go to the hospital , which left only six as his wife departed with him . " Dr. Hendricks always gets a call for ten o'clock , " said Walter Finch . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at home . It 's so convenient being a doctor , and a heart specialist at that . " The others remained until midnight , when the Hotchkisses and Christine Frogg decided to go on to Walter Finch 's apartment and Peter Hoff decided to go to his hotel . " Must you go too , Peter ? " said Ada.  | " No , I just thought it was time I went . " " Then stay awhile , " said Ada . The maids had gone to bed and the house was still and empty . " This is the way this house usually is , but I 'm going to change that . I 'm going to have people in for dinner , like tonight . As you said , there 's no use wasting away . Sit here , beside me . " " I 'll do just that , Ada . You would n't mind if I gave you a little kiss , " said Peter . " Why do n't you try it and see ? " said Ada . Peter kissed her once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her again . His hand , again tentatively , moved inside her bosom , and when Ada made no objection he took out her breast and kissed it . The next move , since they were not children , was up to Ada . " You could take off a few clothes , " said Peter . " Must I ? " said Ada . " Well , a few , " said Peter . " Your corset . " " I 'm afraid the maid will come in , " said Ada , but she stood up and unbuckled her corset and hid it under the sofa cushions . " I do n't want you to go all the way with me , Peter . I have n't since Francis died . But I 'll do anything else you want . I want to go all the way with you , but it ought to be in bed . " " I understand , " said Peter . " You want to give me a suck ? " " I 'll do anything you want , " said Ada . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held it and looked at it . " I do n't think you could have got inside me tonight . Maybe later , but not tonight , " she said . With that she put it in her mouth and made him come . " Oh , that was wonderful , " he said . " Superb . " " It was for me , too . Have you got a handkerchief ? " " Was it wonderful for you too ? I mean , did you come ? " said Peter . " I think so . Maybe not as much as I would in bed , but almost . I 'm still glowing , " said Ada . " Thank you , Peter . " " Thank me ? "  | " For my first experience since Francis died . It meant a lot to me . Thank you for putting my breast in your mouth . That was thrilling , I ca n't tell you how thrilling it was . Was it to you ? " " Well , not as much as the other , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . That can be very exciting to a woman , at least this woman , " said Ada . " I hate to say it , Peter , but I have a suspicion my maid is waiting for me . She wo n't know what 's going on . " " Then you 'd better not tell her , " said Peter . " You 're going to have to put your corset on . " " Dear Peter , I might have forgotten , and then she would have known , " said Ada . " Peter , you know such things . What is a dildo ? " " A dildo ? Why , yes , I know what a dildo is . When I took that trip around the world I saw several in Japan . It 's a kind of a thing , a device , that women insert in their private parts to make them have an orgasm . Where did you ever hear of a dildo ? " " A little Japanese nurse at the hospital told me about them . She said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look her up , she 'd gone back to Japan , so I never found out . " " Would you have used one ? " " Peter , the first year I was a widow I 'd have used anything , but I was always afraid to ask about a dildo . You have no idea how much I missed Francis . He was the only man in my life , literally , the only man in my life . " The next day , shortly after eleven o'clock in the morning , Dr. Hendricks telephoned Ada Ewing with the sad news that Peter Hoff had died in his sleep at his hotel . " Did you know he had a bad heart ? " said Dr. Hendricks . " He 'd been a patient of mine for over a year . I thought perhaps that was why you had invited us to dinner with him . " " No , I did n't know anything about his heart except that it was good  --  not in the medical sense , " said Ada . She wondered how much an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Poor Peter ! He had really wanted to go home but she had made himp100stay , and she blamed her own voluptuousness for what had happened to Peter Hoff . The funeral was to be in Columbus and she thought of attending it until she took into account all those gaping Shriners and the fact that she barely knew his wife . Ada ended up sending neither flowers nor a note of condolence . There was no use leading Mrs. Hoff to believe that there had been more to her acquaintance with Peter than she knew . But there must be other men in the world , and she was free to help herself to one or even more . She would look elsewhere than Cleveland , and this time she got a thousand miles away . Her friend Sophie Cudlipp said to her , " I do n't suppose there 's any use asking you to spend a couple of weeks in Palm Beach . " " There might be , " said Ada . " You mean you 'd go ? " said Sophie . " It 's time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Indeed it is , " said Sophie . " Can you make the trip in my private car ? I leave the fourteenth and I 'll be gone till late March . I 'd love to have you , Ada , truly I would . " " I think I 'd love to visit you for two weeks in February , " said Ada . " Is that all right with you ? " " Absolutely any time . You know I 'm so glad you 're showing signs of life again . I 'd begun to despair of ever waking you up . A woman as attractive as you are ought not to let it all go to waste . You really ought to consider getting married again . " " Oh , no , but I 'm not going to spend the rest of my life with Walter Finch , " said Ada . " As my late lamented used to say , There 's no percentage there , ' " said Sophie . Sophie , a widow for about five years , had inherited a trust fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was no secret that the war in Europe , if it went on as anticipated , might so much as double that . Cuyahoga Iron &; Steel , selling at 4 the year Dick died , was now selling at zo , with no telling where it would end . Sophie met Ada at West Palm Beach station in ap101Pierce-Arrow brougham , accompanied by a white-haired , deeply tanned man whom she introduced as her house guest , Will Levering , of Philadelphia . Will was in his forties , considerably younger than Sophie , and had beautiful manners and beautiful clothes . He was wearing that day a blue linen suit , a soft-brim Panama , and brown and white wing-tip shoes . He saw to Ada 's luggage and got on the box with the chauffeur , allowing the ladies to talk but edging in a word or two through the partition . By the time they reached Lake Worth Ada fully understood the relationship betweenSophie and Will . She owned him . " I 'm taking you to a party at the Stotesburys ' tonight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll give you a chance to meet a lot of people . " " I met Mr. Stotesbury once , at a party in New York . Does n't he play the drum ? " said Ada . " Every chance he gets , " said Will . " That 's all I remember about him , that he played the drum , " said Ada . " A harmless pastime , " said Will . " But do n't forget , he 's a Morganpartner . He 'll undoubtedly play the drum this evening . " Will 's room was on the ocean-front adjoining one side of Sophie 's , and Ada 's was separated from Sophie 's by a bathroom . Not a word was spoken about the proximity of Will 's room to Sophie 's and apparently none would be . Well , more power to Sophie , although it was not quite the arrangement Sophie would have had in her house in Cleveland . They dined that night with a song writer from New York , a comedienne , the comedienne 's currenthusband , and a rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got to the Stotesburys ' ball , and the song writer had made several attacks on Ada 's leg . " Did Sol annoy you with his handiwork ? " said Sophie . " Oh , you noticed that ? " said Ada . " He does that to everybody , " said Sophie . " The one you have to watch out for is Clem . "  | " Clem ? " " The man from Philadelphia with the moustache , the quiet one , " said Sophie . " He 's been known to take it out and hide it under his napkin . " " Good heavens , " said Ada . " His wife thinks it 's funny . Well , we wo n't see any more of them for the rest of the evening . They go home early , presumably to exchange recollections . You 're in Palm Beach now , you know . " " I 'd thought Palm Beach was full of old ladies cutting coupons . " " Like me , " said Sophie . " But there 's something invigorating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Why , he 's very pleasant , good manners , " said Ada . " He spends a month with me and a month with Charlotte Ormsburyand then he goes abroad , but because of the European situationhe is n't going abroad this winter . He pays his own way , you know , or practically . Of course , he 's our house guest for those two months , and that helps considerably , but he 's an excellent golfer , and people like to play with him . " " And that 's all he does ? " said Ada . " How do you mean ? " said Sophie . " I mean , does he make enough playing golf ? " " If you leave out Charlotte Ormsbury and me , no , but there 'd be others to take our places . He would n't have any trouble finding them . Let 's join him , " said Sophie . Her two weeks in Palm Beach were almost up , an uneventful two weeks except for the overtures that had been made and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to last day of her visit , thinking what a waste it had been , when Will entered her bedroom . " Shh , quiet , " he said , and took off his dressing gown and got into bed with her . " You 're leaving tomorrow ? " he said in a whisper . " Yes . " " Then let 's make love , " he said , whispering . The surprise of it was that she was willing and he had known it , and for that shep103was grateful . She put her nightgown over her head , and lay there until they both were ready . And then she guided his penis inside her and only half knowing what she was doing , but knowing , she fucked him . " Oh , that was wonderful , Will , " she said . " Shh , " he whispered . " I have to go now . " She lay on the bed fulfilled , now quite awake but reluctant to change her position . The thought occurred to her , and would not vanish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a question to which she might never know the answer . But of one thing she was certain : as she walked to the train the next day , there was life in her derriere that had not been there for three years . Bill Ewing joined the Preparedness League and became very active in it as well as  --  by coincidence  --  one of the members of the staff of Hotchkiss , Ewing and Kelley who were assigned to attend to the legal problems of the Cuyahoga Iron &; Steel Corporation . It was more or less inevitable that his association with Cuyahoga should affect his views on Preparedness ; Cuyahoga was Preparedness . Clarence Kelley called Bill into his office , asked him to sit down , and began : " Bill , I think I know your views on the war in Europe pretty well . You 're for the Allies , are you not ? " " Yes , I am , and becoming more so , " said Bill . " Good . Now as you know , Cuyahoga Iron &; Steel has become one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " From twelfth or thirteenth two years ago , it 's mushroomed into second place in amount of fees paid us . Jack McNair is giving Cuyahoga practicallyhis full time , for instance , and I need n't tell you that Jack McNair is one of our most valuable men . I wish we had more like him , but you do n't find lawyers like Jack growing on trees , or wherever crackerjack lawyers grow . In point of fact , you find them in a firm like Hotchkiss , Ewing and Kelley . He came with us twenty-odd years ago , fresh from Kenyon College , and he was indentured to me . I taught him all I know about the law , but he had a natural instinct for it that was rare in someone so young . Inp104those days he was inclined to drink too much and we almost had to let him go , but he straightened himself out when he got married . Sally straightened him out , is what I should say . In any event , Jack McNair can have anything he wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full partner . The answer is , he was offered a full partnership and turned it down  --  but he did n't turn down the money . Excuse me , Bill . I have to go to thebathroom . Bladder trouble . But do n't move , I 'll be right back . " The old man returned refreshed and resumed his seat in the high-backed chair . " That 's what keeps me out of court . Some judges would misunderstand my urgency , or my emergency . To continue . We 've decided to let you work with Jack McNair on Cuyahoga . You 've never worked with Jack before , but you 'll findhim easy to get along with , as long as you dot every i and cross every t . And what is most essential to Jack is that you share his views on the war in Europe . That was the first thing he asked me . He said that there would be many occasions when you 'd have to work at night and on Sunday , and you might not see the necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleveland , Ohio , there is need for haste . Well , how do you feel about it ? " " Pretty darn good , " said Bill . " Good , " said Kelley . " This is your first real opportunity with the firm . Up till now you 've been doing the sort of routine work that any law clerk would be doing for any law firm , but this is going to be a bit different . There 'll be a small raise in pay  --  ten dollars , I believe is the amount of the raise , although I 'm not sure . But it 'll be something to help you pay for your golf balls , although when you 're going to get time for golf is another matter . Jack McNairhas n't played golf all summer , but he does n't miss it . I 'm going to move your office closer to Jack 's . You 'll have an office , by the way , not just a desk . " " Clarence , there 's only one thing about this  --  promotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can certainly call it a promotion , " said Kelley.  | " Is n't Bob Hotchkiss next in line ? " said Bill . " I 'm glad you asked that . Yes , Bob is next in line , but as you know , Bob has been made a second lieutenant in the National Guard , and there are rumors that they may be sent to the Mexican Border . I do n't know when , and I do n't know if the rumors are any more than that , but Bob told me that there 's something going on . He would n't say what . Bob has seniority over you , and would ordinarily be entitled to the job with Jack McNair , but we ca n't afford to train Bob in the job , only to have him sent to the Border . We never actually discussed the job with Bob . Naturally he knows you 're going to work with Jack McNair . I told him , and he 's pleased . " " That 's the only thing I was a little worried about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have worried , " said Kelley . " Seniority rules in this firm . Or let me put it this way : seniority rules where courtesy is concerned . Now let me take you in to see Jack . " Jack McNair was one of the few lawyers in the firm who worked in shirtsleeves , with a pipe always in his mouth . " Ah , here we are , " said Jack . He stood up , Kelley remained standing and said , " I wo n't keep you gentlemen , " and departed , whereupon McNair said to Bill , " Have a seat , Bill . " " Thank you , " said Bill . " You 're to have one of the offices next door , and I suggest that the first order of business will be for you to familiarize yourself with the names of the Cuyahoga people . Accordingly , I have got together a list of the men you 'll be dealing with there . There are about twenty , to begin with . Some of them are hard names . For instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a good old Anglo-Saxon name . He does n't the English speak so good , but you would n't know it from his letters . It 's just his accent . His letters are masterpieces of English prose . He 's in charge of labor relations at Cuyahoga , where they have several thousand Poles . I 've prepared you a file of letters to accompany the list of names so that you 'll get acquainted with the work that each manp106does . There 's a man named Nork that just joined Cuyahoga from Hamtramck . He went to the University of Michigan around your time there . He 's in their legal department . " " I know Nork , " said Bill . " Good . Then there 's a whole slew of names that wo n't mean anything to you at first , but you 'll see by their letters that they 're important at Cuyahoga . The file 's on your desk . " " Already ? I have n't even seen my office , " said Bill . " That 's the last time you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years , " said McNair . " Even if we do n't get into the war , there 'll be plenty of work to be done , and if we do get into it , boy ! You 're a member of the Preparedness League , are you not ? " " Yes , I just joined , " said Bill . " Get out of it , Bill . I 'm all for it in principle , but now that you 're so closely identified with Cuyahoga , people will accuse you of being a warmonger , " said McNair . " I 'm afraid I 'm in too deep , " said Bill . " Well , all right , stay in , but do n't make speeches . Leave that to the congressmen . I do n't know what you think of Woodrow Wilson , but there are a lot of men in Congress that think he 's pussyfooting . I do n't happen to think so . I think he 's stalling for time , and that we 'll get into it sooner or later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Preparedness League while I support its aims . But public opinion is with Wilson because he 's pussyfooting , and it 'll change overnight when he decides to declare war . Meanwhile , do n't make any speeches . " " I would n't be likely to . " " Good . Now you can go read those letters , " said McNair . " I hope you 'll be happy in your new job . " " Thank you , I 'm sure I will be , " said Bill . When he got home from work that day he told Edna about the new job . " It 's a promotion , is n't it ? How is Bob Hotchkiss going to feel about that ? " she said.  | " To tell you the truth I do n't much care . Bob 's a second lieutenantin the National Guard , and he 's probably going down to the Mexican Border to chase bandits . I probably should n't say that . It sounds disagreeable . But maybe I am disagreeable . Bob joins the National Guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of uniform and do all the work . " " Did you ever stop to think that they may have promoted you because you 're a better lawyer than Bob ? " said Edna . " How can they tell ? Bob 's been doing the same kind of work that I 've been doing , " said Bill . " But what was it Clarence Kelley said about Jack McNair ? That he had a natural instinct for the law ? I do n't think Bob Hotchkiss has that . He has a natural instinct for golf , maybe , but not for the law , " said Edna . " You 're just trying to make me feel good , " said Bill . " By the way , guess who 's in the legal department at Cuyahoga ? Stanley Nork . " " Stanley Nork , the ex-football player that 's married to Ruth Velie ? They 're living in Cleveland ? How long have they lived here ? " " At least three months . That 's judging by the date of a letter he wrote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Stanley in the new job . " " It 's funny Ruth did n't look us up , " said Edna . " I 'm not even sure she 's living here , but I 'll undoubtedly find out , " said Bill . " I 'm of course dying to see Ruth , " said Edna . " Yes , I can imagine , " said Bill . " Shall we have them for dinner sometime ? " " Let 's give them time to get settled . Say about forty years ? " " Forty years is too long . Let 's make it thirty-five ? " said Bill . " Whatever you say , dear , " said Edna . " Mee-yow , mee-yow , " said Bill . " Actually , Ruth is n't so bad . She just got on her back too often for too many people , and she only did that because they asked her to . At least , I assume theyp108asked her . I wonder how she 's making out with the football player . " " You could always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could always ask him if he 's living with his wife , " said Bill . " I 'm afraid I 'll just have to wait till he brings the subject up . " " Forget the Norks . I 'm so pleased about your promotion , Bill . One good thing that 's come out of this war in Europe , " said Edna . It was about two weeks before the word reached Stanley Nork that Bill Ewing was working with Jack McNair . " I knew that Hotchkiss , Ewing and Kelley were our lawyers , but I did n't know that you had anything to do with us , " said Stanley . " I did n't until two weeks ago , " said Bill . " How are you , Stanley ? " Their conversation was taking place over the telephone . " Pretty good , pretty good . " " I thought you were working in Detroit . " " I was till about six months ago and then I got this offer from Cuyahoga . They wanted a lawyer who could speak Polish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got the job . Ruth was tired of living in Hamtramck and she 'd have gone anywhere . You knew I married Ruth Velie ? " " Yes , I heard that . How is Ruth ? " " Pretty good . We had a hard time finding a house in Cleveland , but we finally rented one on Ninety-fifth Street . I 'll tell her you asked about her . " " Do , " said Bill . " Stanley , Mr. McNair would like your office to have another look at the bottom of page twenty-four of the gunmountcontract before it 's sent to England . That 's page twentyfourof the gun-mount contract . " " Page twenty-four of the gun-mount contract . What 's wrong with it , Bill ? " " He wants to be sure you agree with the delivery date , that 's all . Are you sure it gives us enough time  --  meaning Cuyahoga ? " said Bill . " I 'll have Mr. Ennis read it this afternoon , " said Stanley.  | " That 's not good enough , Stanley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me back by twelve noon . " " I 'll try . Mr. Ennis is a pretty busy man , " said Stanley . " So is Mr. McNair , and Mr. McNair does n't go out to lunch . The contract could be in the hands of the British Purchasing Commissiontomorrow instead of Monday , so do what you can , Stanley . " " That McNair is always in a hurry , " said Stanley . " There 's a war on , " said Bill . " Goodbye , Stanley . " Edgar Ennis , who was head of Cuyahoga 's legal department , was a man who liked to take his time , whether it was in having lunch or reading contracts . It was therefore half-past twelve when Jack McNair opened the door of Bill 's office and said , " Did you hear anything from Ennis ? " " I 'm still waiting to hear from Stanley Nork , " said Bill . " The hell with that . Give me the contract , " said McNair . He stormed out of the office and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union Club and made Ennis read the contract while he was having his oysters , " said McNair . " He could just as easily have been obliging , but he was n't . Now the purchasing commission will get the contract tomorrow instead of Monday . Ennis is a lazy son of a bitch , but he 's Mrs. Cudlipp 's brother , so I ca n't have him fired . However , I gave him an earful at the club . You liking the work ? " " Especially now , " said Bill , smiling . " Think of some way to have Ennis retired , " said McNair . " This is no time for him and his snail 's pace . You have n't had your lunch , have you ? Neither have I. Would you like to have a sandwich with me ? " " I 'd love it , " said Bill . Lunch on a tray , with Jack McNair , grew into a habit with Bill , and as Bill was not yet a member of the Union Club , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was another matter , and he had to put a stop to that . " Mr. McNair , Edna is beginning to complain , " said Bill.  | " What about ? " said McNair . " Two nights in succession I had to tell her I would n't be home for dinner , and I have n't really seen my son in three days . " " That 's my fault , " said McNair . " I 'll try to get you home in time for dinner . How is the boy ? He 's named after John Stewart Ewing , is n't he ? " " Yes , he is , " said Bill . " He 's coming along fine , thank you . " " I knew his great-grandfather , " said McNair . " I knew his greatgrandfather , his grandfather , and his father . If he studies law , he 'll be the fourth generation of lawyers . " " He wo n't study law if his mother has anything to say about it . Right now she 's rather fed up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no home life . " " I apologize for making you miss dinner , " said McNair . " Tell Edna it wo n't happen again . " " I 'd rather you told her , " said Bill . " That would make it official ? All right , Bill . " McNair went home with Bill that evening . " Let me see that son of yours . I have n't seen him yet , " he said . " John Stewart Ewing . I 'd drink a toast to him but I have n't had a drink in twenty years . Say , now , is n't he a fine young man ? Who does he look like ? He has his father 's nose and mouth , but he has his mother 's eyes . Look at that smile . He 's a healthy young man , is n't he ? Oh-oh , he 's getting a little damp . " " I 'll change him , " said Bill . " Give him to me . " " Will you stay for dinner ? " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said McNair . " I have to go back to the office . I only came out here to apologize for keeping your husband , and I 'll try not to let it happen again . Mind you , I do n't promise , but I realize I 've been very unreasonable in my demands on Bill . You 're quite right . Lawyers have very little home life , especially when there 's a war on . " " Is Bill so indispensable ? " " To me he is , " said McNair . " I have n't told him , but we makep111a team that  --  it may be too early to tell  --  but I hope Bill sticks with me . It 's a downright pleasure to work with him . Yes , I would say he 's indispensable , and I have n't ever said that about anyone else . " Bill returned . " Martha 's changing the baby , " he said . " Well , I can get a trolley car at the corner , " said McNair . " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said goodnight . " He looks tired , " said Edna . " He is tired . " " I do n't want you looking like that when you 're fifty . Is n't that about what he is ? " " He 's in his late forties , " said Bill . " Did he convince you in that short time ? " " Of what ? " " Of whatever he tried to convince you of , " said Bill . " He 's a man of great charm , if that 's what you mean , and he knows it . I do n't usually like men who have charm and know it , but he has enough sincerity to make him irresistible . " " He has a son a Deke at Kenyon , the same way . Young Scotty . He 's on the tennis team and has n't lost a match in intercollegiate competition . Never trains . Just goes out and beats everybody in sight . " " Was Jack a Deke ? " " An Alpha Delt , " said Bill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edna . " No . Have I got Deke charm ? " " You sure have , and do n't pretend you do n't know it , " said Edna . " I was hoping it was just plain old William B. Ewing charm , " said Bill . " Oh , you have that too , but you save that for our intimate moments , " said Edna . " I do n't want anyone to touch that . Deke charm is different , public . Manners , the right clothes , things like that . The William B. Ewing charm is private . "  | " So is the Edna Everett charm , very private , " said Bill . " I was hoping you 'd say that , " said Edna . " We 'll go to bed early tonight . But now let 's have our dinner . I 'll put John-Stewart to bed and he 'll be asleep by the time we 've had dinner . I love you , Bill . I did n't for the last two nights , but you 're just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's more , I can do something for you that Jack McNair ca n't . " " Or anyone else , " said Bill . There was a farewell party for Bob Hotchkiss when his regimentwas sent to the Mexican Border . Bob , in his campaign hat and leather puttees and breeches , had already put away the manners of a civilian and adopted the manner of a second lieutenant . The party was a luncheon at the Union Club , the toastmaster was Clarence Kelley , who remarked that Bob , as an officer in his country'sservice , had hardly been elected to membership in the club before he got on the non-dues-paying roster . Kelley hoped that Bob would soon be back paying dues , as the club needed the money , and the firm needed Bob . Kelley then introduced Jack McNair , who said that Bob Hotchkiss would be sorely missed at the office , and Edgar Ennis , who spoke too long and declared that Bob 's father would be proud of him . They then presented Bob with a set of matched luggage and Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feeling that they had done their patriotic duty to a man who was not headed for the real war . But Bob was the first man in uniform in the office of Hotchkiss , Ewing and Kelley and he was determined to make the most of it . " Most of the men in my platoon have never been out of the State of Ohio , " he told Kelley , " and I expect my first big problem will be morale . But they 're good men for the most part . " " You 'll manage , " said Kelley . " You 'll manage . " Jack McNair and Bill Ewing walked back to the office together . " I suppose Wilson is right , sending the troops to the Border , " said McNair . " What do you think , Bill . You 're a young man . " " I do n't think many of them will get to Mexico , but maybe that'sp113not the point , " said Bill . " Bob looked very snappy in his uniform . " " That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people used to seeing men in uniform . My guess is that we 'll be in the big show in Europe inside of a year . Have you thought of what you 'll do then ? " " Oh , I 'll join the army , " said Bill . " What if you 're needed here ? " said McNair . " I 'll still join the army , " said Bill . " As you said , I 'm a young man . " " I want to talk to you about that , " said McNair . " All right , when the time comes , but my mind is made up , " said Bill . That night at home Bill said to Edna , " We 're not even in the war yet , but Jack McNair 's already determined to keep me out of it . " " That sounds as if you were determined to get into it , " she said . " Well , of course I am . Do you want me to be labeled a pacifist ? " said Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pacifist , " said Edna . " Everybodywill know you 're anything but . Seeing Bob Hotchkiss in uniformwas too much for you , was n't it ? What is there about a uniform ? Boots and spurs . " " Actually , Bob wore leather puttees , so it was n't boots and spurs , " said Bill . " Personally , I think the British uniform is much more becoming . " Well , so do I , " said Bill . " Maybe I 'll get them to change ours . " " Do they carry swords ? " " I believe the expression is wear swords . ' I do n't believe the British do any more , " said Bill . " They did in the beginning of the war , but swords have no place in trench warfare . Swords , or sabres , went out with the horse . There 's no such thing as a cavalry charge any more . The uhlans have stopped carrying lances . " " Who on earth are the uhlans ? " said Edna.  | " German cavalry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the subject of swords ? " " Swords ? I do n't know . Yes , I do , " said Edna . " I was thinking of Bob and poor Priscilla . " " I do n't see the connection , " said Bill . " No , I guess you do n't . Priscilla used to refer to Bob 's thing as his sword . " " His thing ? You mean his pecker ? Do you talk about Bob 's pecker ? " " Priscilla called it his sword . She had to have some name for it , " said Edna . " I did n't know you ever talked about it at all . " " How do you suppose we ever talked about having babies ? " " I did n't know you ever did , " said Bill . " Priscilla always said Bob put his sword in me , " and at first I did n't know what she was talking about . Anyway , it 'll be a long time before Bob puts his sword in Priscilla again , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what war does . Separates people , people that should be together , like Bob and Priscilla , like you and me . " Edna and Priscilla , being young wives of young lawyers , in the same firm , had that much in common , and they both had young children . But Priscilla had been the repository for Bob Hotchkiss 's growing jealousy of Bill Ewing , and to this was added Bob 's petulantsuperiority over Bill for not joining the National Guard . Bob , in his letters to Priscilla from El Paso , was unable to refrain from commenting on Bill 's pacifism , his slacking , his showing the white feather , and Priscilla , always swearing Edna to secrecy , could not always refrain from reading the letters aloud . " Do n't tell Bill Bob said this , but Bob resents Bill , " said Priscilla . " Do you resent Bill ? " said Edna . " Of course I do n't . Somebody has to stay home , " said Priscilla . " Most people are staying home , Priscilla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get over it . "  | " I hope he does , " said Edna . " They 've known each other so long . School together , and their fathers and mothers friends . " " Their fathers were partners , but I do n't know how good friends they were , " said Priscilla . " Oh , well now I never knew that . I of course never knew Mr. Hotchkiss , but I took for granted they were friends , " said Edna . " Clarence Kelley was always closer to Mr. Ewing than he was to Mr. Hotchkiss . Mr. Hotchkiss took Mrs. Kelley 's side years ago , when Mrs. Kelley had her nervous breakdown . " " I always understood the nervous breakdown was from too much alcohol , " said Edna . " Well , naturally you heard Mr. Kelley 's side of it , from Mr. Ewing . " " Mr. Ewing never spoke to me about Mr. or Mrs. Kelley . He died soon after we were married , " said Edna . " Uh-huh . Well , naturally Mr. Kelley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever would be to Bob Hotchkiss , " said Priscilla . " He recommended Bill to Jack McNair , and that was quite a promotion . But let 's not have that make any difference between us , Edna . I consider you my closest friend in Cleveland . I 've lived here four years , and it seems to me I could have made more friends in Cleveland , but I came here from Springfield , Mass. , and you talk about Boston being snobbish . I 'll give you Cleveland any time . My father manufactured bicycles . The Lightning . You may have heard of it . It was very successful . " " Oh , yes . My father had a Lightning , " said Edna . " He manufactured the Lightning till one of the big companies bought him out and he retired . We had plenty of money and I went to Smith College for a year before I married Bob . Bob was going to the Yale Law School , having been to Denison University before that , a Sigma Chi . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denison , and Cleveland was somewhere out in the tall timbers . They sure took me down a peg or two . I did n't know a soul in Cleveland , not a single , solitary soul . I used to walk alongp116Euclid Avenue just to be with people . One day I remember I was walking along Euclid and a man stopped me and said , Are n't you Priscilla Bascom ? ' and I said , Yes , but who are you ? ' And he said he was Kenneth Hires , used to be a foreman at the Lightning factory before my father sold out . He was working for a rubber company in Akron and was just in town for the day . I did n't know him from Adam and he was n't very attractive but I stood and talked to him for fifteen minutes , just to have someone to talk to . I told Bob to hurry up and make me pregnant or I would n't be responsible . Incidentally , I wanted another baby when he left for the Border , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gets back , whenever that will be . " " Do you like it any better here now ? " said Edna . " Oh , yes . I have the baby now , but I have n't got Bob , " said Priscilla . On an impulse Edna said , " How would you like to spend Christmaswith us ? " " Oh , I could n't , " said Priscilla . " Do you mean it ? " " It 'll just be Bill and I and Mrs. Ewing . " " Mrs. Ewing , Bill 's mother ? I know her , but  --  no , I do n't think I 'd better . She always struck me as rather strange . " " That 's because she 's been in mourning so long . But she blossomedout last spring . I see what you mean , but she is n't that way any more . " " Are you sure you want me ? " said Priscilla . " Of course I 'm sure , " said Edna . " Can I let you know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob , is that it ? " said Edna . " Well , yes . He might not like it , " said Priscilla . " He 's only got a week to find out . Why do n't you let him know after Christmas . You want to come , Priscilla . " " Yes , I do . Very well , if you 're sure it 's all right . I wo n't be in the way , " said Priscilla . " Is it all right if I bring the baby ? "  | " I 'm counting on it , " said Edna . " Come around noon and stay all day . " Mrs. Ewing said it was awfully thoughtful of Edna to have Priscilla . She knew what it was not to have a husband at Christmas-time . Bill was slightly more difficult . " It 's an act of kindness , but I 'm not sure it will be appreciated , " said Bill . " If you were gone , I 'd expect her to have me , " said Edna . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Bill . Priscilla arrived shortly after noon on Christmas Day , with presents for Edna , Bill , and Mrs. Ewing : a negligee for Edna , a handbag for Mrs. Ewing , a wallet for Bill . " You can exchange them after Christmas except Bill 's wallet , that has his initials on it . " " You got me almost the same thing I got you , " said Edna . " I bought you a dozen silk stockings , " said Mrs. Ewing . " I bought you a sweater . I hope it 's the right size , " said Bill . " I decided to leave the baby at home with Anna . He 's still too young to appreciate Christmas , and I was afraid he 'd give JohnStewarthis cold . Have you noticed how many colds are around ? " said Priscilla . " It 's the time of the year , " said Edna . " I 'm dying to know what you got from Bob . " " I should have brought it with me . It 's an armadillo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly hideous beaded belt that I 'll never wear . But it was all he could get . Shopping is n't easy in El Paso , as you can imagine . " At one o'clock they sat down to a turkey dinner and champagne . " Real pain to our sham friends and champagne to our real friends , " said Priscilla . " That was Bob 's favorite toast whenever he drank champagne . " " Well , here 's to Bob and a quick and safe return to Ohio , " said Bill . " I 'll certainly drink to that , " said Priscilla , and did so . " Priscilla , have another piece of mince pie , " said Bill.  | " There 's something in it , is n't there ? " said Priscilla . " A touch of brandy , not enough to hurt you , " said Bill . " You do n't know me . Champagne and brandy . Oh , all right , " she said . " It does n't affect you the way it does me , does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Priscilla ? " said Ada Ewing . " It makes me want to go to bed with a man , " said Priscilla . " No , then it does n't , " said Ada Ewing . " Maybe if I took enough it would . " " Why , Mother , " said Bill . " You shock me . " " Oh , why should I ? " said Ada Ewing . " You do n't really , but you must admit I 've never heard you talk this way before , " said Bill . " Then it 's high time you did . Priscilla , have another glass of champagne , " said Ada Ewing . " I 'll have one if you will , " said Priscilla . " No sooner said than done , " said Ada , and the two women touched their glasses and drank . Edna watched them , fascinated and trying without success to force herself to smile . Her motherin-lawignored her and smiled at Priscilla . For some reason , or possibly for no reason , Edna was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a Christmas full of loneliness and final desperation , ending with Faith 's naked body on the bathroom floor . But Edna was not sure whether Ada Ewing reminded her of Faith McCracken or if she was reminded of Faith by Priscilla and her loneliness . Priscilla 's remark about wanting to go to bed with a man was Faith 's unuttered cry , but Ada Ewing had been its echo . And yet there was something more to it than that . There was more to it than that . Ada Ewing offered to help with the dishes . " I 'd offer to help too , but I might break some , " said Priscilla . " Martha will attend to the dishes , " said Edna . " In that case , you 'll forgive me if I have to go , " said Ada Ewing . " So soon ? " said Edna.  | " I have to go out to the farm and deliver some presents , " said Ada . " Priscilla , why do n't you come with me ? We can both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good idea , " said Priscilla . With hardly more than a routine protest on the part of Edna , the two guests got in the Pierce-Arrow and were driven to the country . " I will say the fresh air should do them both some good , " said Edna . " And it 's snowing . " " I hope Walter has chains , " said Bill . " They 're going to need them . They 're having a blizzard in Chicago . " " They 're having one in Wingate too , " said Edna . " Let 's talk about the blizzard in Wingate . Let 's talk about anything but our departed guests . " " All right with me , " said Bill . " Mother has certainly changed . " " I thought we were n't going to talk about them , " said Edna . " Did Mother have anything to drink before she came here ? " said Bill . " How should I know ? No , I do n't think so . But the champagne flowed pretty freely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's Christmas , " said Bill . " I 'm going to have to call Jack McNair sometime this afternoon . I 'll bet he 's at the office . " " Well , do n't feel you have to go too , " said Edna . " I may have to for an hour or so . I 'm sure Bob Hotchkiss does n't stop chasing bandits on Christmas , " said Bill . Meanwhile , in the Pierce-Arrow with the side curtains snugly closed , Ada Ewing and Priscilla Hotchkiss were wrapped in buffalo robes against the cold . " It 's nice and cozy in the car , " said Priscilla . " It is , but my next car will be a limousine , " said Ada . " I 'm gettingold enough for a closed car . This car is about five or six years old , and there 've been a lot of improvements since this was new . It 's warm , but it is n't warm enough . " " When you get a limousine will you take me for a ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Ada . " You 've never seen our farm , have you ? " " Not close to , " said Priscilla . " Only from the road . " " I like it when the ground is covered with snow . But then I like it all the time , even when you 're knee-deep in mud . I come out here almost every day in the spring and summer . I think we may be in for a blizzard , " said Ada . " I wonder if we ought to turn back . Walter , do you think we ought to turn back ? " " It 's coming down pretty heavy , " said Walter . " Well , we 're almost there , " said Ada . " You may have to spend the night on the farm , Priscilla . I 'm sorry . " " That 's all right , as long as I can telephone home , " said Priscilla . " You can if the wires are n't down , " said Ada . They arrived at the farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You brought us a little snow , " said Lloyd . " So I did . This is Mrs. Hotchkiss . We may have to spend the night , " said Ada . " Is the house ready ? " " It 's always ready , Mrs. Ewing , " said Beulah . " Even Walter 's room . The house is n't warm yet , but it will be . Will you have supper in our house ? " " Thank you , Beulah . I brought you a few presents , " said Ada . There was a shotgun for Lloyd , a sheepskin coat for Beulah , some toys for the Sharpe children , while Beulah had knitted a sweater for Ada . " What time will supper be ready ? " said Ada . " When I get through the milking , " said Lloyd . " About six . " Ada and Priscilla had supper with the Sharpes in their house , and after supper Priscilla telephoned Ann . By that time Ada 's house was warm , and Ada suggested bed . " I brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's flannel , but I think you 'll need it tonight . It 's still snowing . I 'm sorry I could n't show you more of the farm , but there 'll be another time . Breakfast is at seven , and we 'll start back to town as soon as Walter thinks the roads are clear . Can I get you anything else before we go to bed ? "  | " Nothing , thank you , " said Priscilla . " I 'm sorry I got a little tiddly at dinner today . " " Oh , we both did , Priscilla . Goodnight . " At about eleven o'clock Priscilla came to Ada 's room . " Can I sleep with you ? Are you still awake ? " " Come in , " said Ada . She made room for Priscilla in her bed , and they went to sleep with their arms around each other . Once , during the night , Ada awoke and kissed the sleeping girl , and she thought she must not do that . But Ada Ewing was soon asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sharpe 's kitchen and Walter came in to tell them that the snowplow had been at work since six o'clock and that the road was fairly clear . " Then we 'll be on our way , " said Ada . They said goodbye to Beulah  --  Lloyd was shoveling snow  --  and got in the Pierce-Arrow and headed for Cleveland . " Did you have a good rest ? " said Ada . " Perfect . I even had a dream that you kissed me , " said Priscilla . " That was n't a dream , Priscilla . I did kiss you , " said Ada . " I was n't sure , " said Priscilla . " Is there anything wrong with that ? " said Ada . " No , no . You can kiss me any time you want to , " said Priscilla . " But I 'd rather you did it while I was awake . " " Hereafter I will , " said Ada . " When ? " said Priscilla . " When ? " said Ada . " Why , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I could come to your house this afternoon , or we could spend the night at the farm , " said Priscilla . " Let 's do that , spend the night at the farm . " " Priscilla , do you know what you 're saying ? " said Ada . " Yes , do n't you ? " said Priscilla . " Yes , I guess I do , " said Ada . " Who 'll ever know ? My husband 's away , and I would n't tellp122him anyway . Shall I tell you a secret ? " said Priscilla . " What ? " " Do you know why Bob joined the national guard ? " " No , " said Ada . " He 'd kill himself if he thought anybody knew . Promise you wo n't tell . Promise ? " " I promise , " said Ada . " Bob is very handsome and all that , and remember I told you I wanted to have another baby by him , but we could n't . We tried everything , everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only likes men . " " Priscilla ! I do n't believe it , " said Ada . " Bob Hotchkiss ? " " Do you know how long it 's been since he had relations with me ? " said Priscilla . " At least a year . He has a few drinks and wants me to get undressed , and I do , but that 's as far as it goes . He looks at me , and all he does is cry . I do n't think he does anything with men , either , but he likes to be with them . He sent me some snapshotsand they were all pictures of naked men in swimming . He wrote on the back of one of the snapshots , Being faithful to you . ' Faithful  --  well , maybe . But he 's very jealous of me , especially where Bill Ewing is concerned . I asked him once what he would do if I ever had an affair with Bill Ewing , and he said he 'd kill both of us . He hates Bill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than he is . If I so much as look at another man he threatens to beat me , and he 's strong . " " You had one child by him , " said Ada . " Yes , I did , but how long ago was that ? Even then he made me turn around . " " How do you mean ? " said Ada . " He pretended I was a man . He could n't do it from the front . He likes to look at me , but it only makes him cry . " " Bob Hotchkiss , the athlete , the strong man , " said Ada . " The man you 'd least suspect . " " Unless you knew him , " said Priscilla.  | " But I 've known Bob all his life , " said Ada . " Not in bed . " " No , that makes a difference , " said Ada . " Now maybe you understand why I was glad when you kissed me , " said Priscilla . " It was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long . I need affection . " " Yes , you do , and do n't we all ? " said Ada . She kissed Priscilla and Priscilla kissed her in turn . " It 's not the same , is it ? " said Priscilla . " No , but it 's good , " said Ada . " It 's affection , and who can do without that ? " " Will you take me out to the farm , tomorrow ? " said Priscilla . " Are you sure you want to ? " said Ada . " I just want to be with you . You 're not afraid , are you ? " " I am , a little , " said Ada . " So am I. " " Shall we wait and see how we both feel tomorrow ? " said Ada . " Yes , " said Priscilla . They were at Priscilla 's house . " Goodbye , my dear , " said Ada . " Good-bye , " said Priscilla . There was nothing in God 's world that could keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was told by Ann that Mrs. Hotchkiss had gone to the grocery store and would be back in an hour . When Priscilla telephoned her , Ada was beside the phone . " I did n't want to call you too early , " said Priscilla . " Are we going ? Are you going to take me ? " " I 'll be at your house in half an hour , " said Ada . The excitement was almost unbearable . She had no plans , knew not what to expect , but her head was spinning with anticipation . " Go to Mrs. Hotchkiss 's , " she told Walter . " We 're spending the day at the farm . " " Whatever you say , ma'am , " said Walter . " Did you call off Mrs. Bill ? " " Oh , heavens , I forgot about Mrs. Bill , " said Ada . " You were s'pose to go there to meet her father and mother , "  |p124said  Walter . " I was s'pose to meet them on the twelve-thirty from Detroit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Ada . She telephoned Edna . " Edna , something has come up and I have to go to the farm . Will you meet your father and mother ? I wo n't be able to have lunch with you , but I 'll get there as soon as I can . It may be late this afternoon , but I 'll be there . I 'm sorry , dear , but you understand . " She had no excuse to offer , but it was better to offer none than to offer a lame one . She would think of something when her head stopped spinning . " Mother and Daddy will be terribly disappointed , " said Edna . " Is there something the matter at the farm ? " " I 'll explain it when I see you , " said Ada . There was the danger that Edna would see the Pierce-Arrow at Priscilla 's house ; they lived only two blocks apart . But that was a chance Ada had to take , and she took it . As good fortune would have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat on , fur coat ready to be put on . " Tell Mrs. Hotchkiss I 'm waiting , " Ada said to Walter . " She 's coming , " said Walter . " I was waiting for you , " said Priscilla . " Never mind the lap robes , Walter . We 'll put them on ourselves , " said Ada . " I 'm glad you were waiting , Priscilla . We must n't letEdna see us . " " Yes , " Yes , I thought of that . That 's why I was ready , " said Priscilla . " Are you as excited as I am ? " " Yes , and what for ? " said Ada . " That 's just it . We do n't know what for . I 've thought about you since yesterday , you were never out of my thoughts . What shall we do when we get there ? Do we have to have lunch with Mrs. Sharpe ? " " I have n't thought that far ahead , " said Ada . " We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I do n't really like that woman , " said Priscilla . " I do n't know why , but she rubs mep125the wrong way . What if she comes to your house to make the beds ? " " No , she wo n't do that . She 'll have made the beds yesterday . I 'll say that for her , she 's a good housekeeper . We 're both excited , Priscilla , and we 're suspicious of everybody . " " We 're like two lovers , " said Priscilla . " Exactly , " said Ada . " I can hardly wait to have you kiss me , but the chauffeur would think it 's funny , two women kissing each other , " said Priscilla . " You 're suspicious of Walter , and so am I , " said Ada . " There were two girls at Smith College . I never knew what they did . Maybe nothing . You always saw them together and you wondered . But they were the same age , and virgins . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Ada . " How many men have you known ? " " Two . Bob , first , and one other since Bob . " " Who was that ? " said Ada . " You do n't know him . He 's a man I met on the train . I only saw him a few times after that . He comes from Buffalo , New York . How many have you known ? " " Two . My husband , and a man in Palm Beach , " said Ada . " That 's all ? " " That 's all . A wasted life , would n't you call it ? " said Ada . " You never slept with Clarence Kelley ? " " No , I never did . " " Bob was sure you had , " said Priscilla . " Other people thought that too , but I did n't . There 's the farm . We 'll go to my house and ignore Beulah Sharpe . I hope there 's plenty of hot water , but there will be . Beulah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking baths in the middle of the day , but we 'll make some excuse . " " Is that what we 're going to do , take baths ? " " Unless you have a better idea , " said Ada . The dominant person , the guide , was Ada Ewing . Once insidep126the house they took off their coats and arctics , and Ada put her arms around Priscilla and kissed her . Priscilla responded and awaited Ada 's next move in silence . Taking Priscilla by the hand , she mounted the stairs and they went to Ada 's bedroom . " Let me take off your dress , " said Ada . When she had done so Ada said , " You have a gorgeous little figure , Priscilla . " Priscilla still said nothing , and stood in her chemise as Ada stripped her naked . " Gorgeous , " said Ada . " How could any man not appreciate that figure ? Now I 'll join you . " Ada took off her clothes and the two women stood admiring each other , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tub , " said Ada . " Are n't you going to kiss me ? " said Priscilla . " Let 's wait , " said Ada . " We 'll prolong it , " she added . The tub was running and the women stood against each other , Ada slightly taller and with breasts fuller than Priscilla 's . " What do we do now ? " said Priscilla . " You get into the tub . We 'll get in together . I must have been thinking of this when I ordered a big tub , " said Ada . They got into the tub , facing each other , and Ada kissed Priscilla . " Kneel up , " said Ada . " Kneel up , facing me . " Priscilla did so , and they kissed each other and Ada put her hands on Priscilla 's buttocks , squeezing them . " I like that , " said Priscilla . " Shall I do it to you ? " " Of course , do what you want , " said Ada , " Now let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And I 'll dry you , " said Priscilla . They got out of the tub and Priscilla said , " It 's cold . Woo , it 's cold . " " Oh , you 're such a baby , " said Ada . " Let me dry you , and you 'll soon be warm . " " Am I such a baby ? It is cold . " " It is a bit cold , but I 'll soon have you warmed up , " said Ada . She took a towel and rubbed Priscilla all over her body brisklyp127except when she came to the part between her legs , which she rubbed slowly . " I like that too , " said Priscilla . " Do it some more . " " Like this ? " said Ada . " Not with the towel , with your hand . That 's better . Shall I do 1 that to you ? " " Yes , " said Ada . " Shall I kiss you there ? " " I wish you would , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " At the same time ? " said Priscilla . " Yes , " said Ada . " This is what we wanted to do all the time , is n't it ? " said Priscilla . " I guess it must be , " said Ada . She lay on the bed , and Priscillalay beside her . " I thought you were going to kiss me , there . " " I will , and you kiss me , there , " said Priscilla . " The French call it the soixante-neu f . " " I know , " said Ada . " Do it , and let 's not talk about it . " " But I like to talk about it , " said Priscilla . " Who do you talk about it to ? " " You , " said Priscilla . They kissed each other until they were tired . " I have to stop now , " said Ada . " I have to , too , " said Priscilla . Ada changed her position and put her arm around Priscilla 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ada . " Yes . Why is it supposed to be so wrong ? " said Priscilla . " I do n't know , " said Ada . " I 've never done it with anyone else , but I could go on doing it to you , except that I 'm tired . " " They say it 's not natural , but it was natural to me , " said Priscilla . " It 's as natural as Bob Hotchkiss liking only men , " said Ada . " Shall we do it again sometime  --  I do n't mean now . I think we 'd better get dressed , now . But you were excited , were n't you ? "  | " More excited than I 've ever been . " " Then we 'll do it again , " said Ada . " Maybe there 's something we do n't know , " said Priscilla . " Yes , maybe if we did it one at a time . You to me and I to you , " said Ada . " I think that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try that next time , " said Ada . " Now I think we 'd better get dressed . Oh , you darling girl . Why do I love you so ? " " Because I love you too . " " They kissed each other and got dressed . " I have to go see Lloyd Sharpe , but I 'll only be a minute . I have to have some excuse for coming out here today . Then I think we 'd better be getting back to town . " " You have such dignity , you 're so efficient , " said Priscilla . " The dignity is a result of a lifetime of repression , Priscilla . " They returned to town and Ada dropped Priscilla . She spentthe remainder of the afternoon listening to the gossip about Wingate , and Mrs. Everett was full of that . Nearly a year had gone by since Ada 's visit to Sophie Cudlipp in Palm Beach and Will Levering 's visit to her , the high point of her visit . But if Will Levering 's morning call had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it soon became insignific ' nt . She was probably never going to see Will Levering again ; a half hour of impromptu love-making with a man from Philadelphia ( who may well have been sent to her room by Sophie ) became in retrospect a half hour of pleasure and no more than that . Sophie Cudlipp had not been to Cleveland in all that time ; New York , Newport , New York , Saratoga , Newport , and New York were the postmarks of Sophie 's postcards . Then there came a letter from Palm Beach , inviting her to stay with her there , and Ada on an impulse accepted . She was , she knew , running away from Priscilla , but would not Priscilla run away from her ? " I have to go to Florida for a couple of weeks , " Ada told Priscilla over the telephone.  | " Florida ? What about me ? " " I 'll be back , Priscilla , " said Ada . " But three weeks ? That 's forever , " said Priscilla . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love you , dear , but  --  " There was a click on the telephone ; 1 Priscilla had hung up . Impetuous and piqued , Priscilla had hung up and given Ada an excuse for Ada to do what she wanted to do , which was to spend some time with her guilty conscience . And it was a guilty conscience . She had seduced Priscilla , and she wanted to get away for a few weeks . Will Levering once again was in the car that met Ada at West Palm Beach , but this time he was in the back seat . " Sophie asked me to meet you , " said Will . " She 's getting a permanent . " " There 's something I 've been dying to ask you , " said Ada . " Did Sophie send you to my room a year ago ? Now tell me the truth , Will . " " Well , yes and no , " said Will . " It was your last day , and Sophie was anxious to see that you had a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That was nice of you , " said Ada . " I 'd still be willing , " said Will . " You 're a sort of stallion , are n't you ? " said Ada . " I guess you could call me that , " said Will . " But I do n't think you 'd better say anything about this conversation . " " Why not ? Surely you told Sophie that you 'd slept with me . " " Yes , I did , but she may have forgotten . Sophie has other stallionsnow . She 's probably with one of them right this minute . You could have one too , you know . You 're much better-looking than Sophie , and you 're younger . You do n't know Palm Beach , Ada . It 's really depraved , and Sophie is one of the most depraved women here . She 's discovered a motorcycle policeman that she sends for now and then and pays him a hundred dollars . That 's in addition to her other stallions . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Ada.  | " You can believe me , " said Will . " I 'd abandon Sophie , but I 've gotten very fond of the old dear . If she was ten years younger I 'd marry her , but I would n't inherit all those millions from Cuyahoga , so I have my eye on someone else . Shall I come to your room in about an hour ? " " I guess that 's why I came to Palm Beach , " said Ada . " You 're honest to admit it , " said Will . " I do n't know what 's happened to me lately , " said Ada . " I 'm as depraved as Sophie . " " Why not ? " said Will . Ada did not have time to read the papers during her visit to Palm Beach ; she was more pleasurably occupied with Will Levering , who made it clear to Sophie that inasmuch as she was fairly busy with her motorcycle policeman , he would entertain Ada . This did not sit too well with Sophie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will was after all her idea . Ada 's visit to Palm Beach was not marked by the cordiality of the previous year , and Sophie did not persuade her to linger past the second week in February . On her return to Cleveland almost the first thing she heard was that General Pershing had been ordered home from Mexico , and Bob Hotchkiss was back in Cleveland . Tanned by the El Paso sun , Bob was now a first lieutenant , which meant silver bars instead of gold on his shoulder straps but also meant that he could no longer be called a shavetail . What else it meant was that he was sleeping with Priscilla , at least temporarily . Ada telephoned her , and Priscilla was cool toward her . " Oh , you 're back , " said Priscilla . " How was Florida ? " " Fine , but I missed you , " said Ada . " You 'll have to go on missing me . Bob 's back too . " " So I heard , " said Ada . " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget them , " said Priscilla . " I 'd hardly forget them , but I wo n't repeat them , " said Ada . " It sounds as though things were all right with you two . Are they ? "  | " He 's affectionate , if you know what I mean , " said Priscilla . " I know what you mean , " said Ada . " No more baths . " " Baths ? Oh , baths . No , no more baths . " " Well , I 'll miss you , Priscilla , but if Bob is affectionate as you say , he 's your husband , " said Ada . " You 'll find someone else , " said Priscilla . " It looks as though I 'll have to , " said Ada . " Do n't call me any more , " said Priscilla . " Somebody might be listening . " " Oh , do n't worry your pretty head about that , Priscilla , " said Ada . " But I was going to give a party for Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But I will . I want to hear all about the Mexican Border , " said Ada . She gave what turned out to be the largest party for Bob . He could not wear his uniform , but he remembered seven officers and men who had served with him and whom Ada had not included on her original invitation list . Cleveland society was well represented by the McVeaghs , the Hays , Holcombs , and the Swarzes , who also represented the board of directors of Cuyahoga . Walter Finch was there as was Christine Frogg , and they were both acquainted with the seven officers and men who were strangers to Ada , a fact which did not pass unobserved by Ada . Dr. and Mrs. Hendricks were there and stayed until after eleven o'clock . Most of the men wore white tie and tails , although some of the younger men wore Tuxedos . There were at least two hundredfor dancing , and Ada had forty people in for dinner . Clarence Kelley was her escort and Jack McNair was her dancing partner . " Smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that " It 's a Long Way to Tipperary . " A colonel and a leftenant attached to the British Purchasing Commission dropped in by invitation of Jack McNair and behaved themselves admirably , although the leftenant had trouble believing there was such a place as Chillicothe . " My dear fellow , there must be four or fivep132Chillicothes , " said Dr. Hendricks . To which the leftenant replied , " Is n't one enough ? " Otherwise amity prevailed until two A.M. and Bob Hotchkiss , who had had that extra glass of champagne , decided he wanted to spend the rest of the evening with his army buddies . Priscilla went home with Clarence Kelley . At eleven o'clock the next morning Clarence Kelley spoke to Ada on the telephone . " Could you possibly have lunch with me ? " said Clarence . " I thought we 'd go to the hotel . " Ada , with a successful party behind her , met Clarence . " I chose the hotel because it was public and what I have to say to you is private , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old trick of mine . Public place for private conversation . Ada , I want you to go away for a while . I know you 've just come back from Palm Beach , but why not try California ? " He cleared his throat . " Last night I took Priscilla Hotchkiss home from your party , and she unburdened herself of a lot of scandal that involves a lot of people . First , there was her husband . How much truth there is in what she told me about Bob , I have no way of knowing . But for what it 's worth , she 's convinced that Bob is a homosexual . He 's fond of men . And I must say that that does n't surprise me as much as it did her . I have n't got time to tell you why I suspected Bob . Suffice it to say , I had suspected him , and if what she says is true , the Lord help Bob . But then she launched into an accusation of you , Ada , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you tell me that what she said about you is n't true ? " " I do n't know what she told you , but it probably is true , " said Ada . " Did she tell you that we took a bath together at the farm ? " " Yes , " said Kelley . " That you got undressed and took a bath together , and that you had relations together , you and Priscilla . It sounds relatively harmless when you put it that way , but can you imagine what Cleveland gossip could do to a story like that ? I think you ought to go away . " " Why go away , Clarence ? "  | " Have you thought of Bill ? Bill and Edna and the baby ? Have you thought of Francis ? Have you thought of yourself ? " " Yes , and I 've thought of Priscilla , " said Ada . " I knew it was wrong , what I did . I could n't help myself , although that 's no excuse . I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forget . But I did n't forget , and I did think it over . I 'm past fifty , Clarence , and old enough to know better , but this girl attractedme and I attracted her , and I ca n't honestly say it 'll never happen again . Do I make any sense to you ? Do you think I 'm incorrigible ? " " The workings of the female mind are mysterious to me . " " No , they 're not . You understand women as well as any man I 've ever known , " said Ada . " You understood Bob Hotchkiss , so you ought to understand me . We have the same problem , have n't we ? Bob joined the army , and I took a bath with his wife . I kissed her where a woman ought not to kiss another woman , and she kissed me in the same place . It shocks you to hear that , but we have no secrets , you and I. I 'm not going away , Clarence . " " It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gossip , but you 're not thinking of Bill . " " I 've thought of Bill . If he has a degenerate mother , people are n't going to hold that against him . He 's the normal son of a normal father and it 's too bad about his mother . No , I 'm not going away . It may interest you to learn that I had an affair with a man in Palm Beach , and enjoyed it . Maybe I am incorrigible , Clarence . Maybe I just got started late in life . But I 'm not going to reform , and I 'm not going away . " " On advice of counsel  --  you 're ignoring advice of counsel , " said Kelley . " In other words , do what you think best , Ada . I 'd miss you if you went to California . " " Would you , Clarence ? You hardly ever see me , " said Ada . " I think of you a great deal , and I think a great deal of you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means always the same . You 're a strong woman , Ada . That 's the word for you  --  strong . " " Enough about me . Are we going to get in the war ? " said Ada . " What can possibly keep us out ? Wilson gets in in a few days , and then it 'll be only a question of time , " said Kelley . " That 's all it is anyway , a question of time . Once you sever diplomatic relations , the fat 's in the fire . Which may well be to your advantage . People will be so busy talking about the war that they wo n't be talking about you . However , do n't count on it . " " I 'm not counting on anything , " said Ada . " Except your friendship . " The war was on . It hardly mattered that there had been nearly three years of hostilities involving England , France , Russia , Germany , Italy , Belgium , Austria-Hungary , Turkey and the yet unmade nations of Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although Luxembourg and the United States of America were not yet in it , but Woodrow Wilson in his wisdom had decided that the time had come when he could n , o longer stay out of it . And so the Congress , with the exception of a little old maid from Montana , concurred in his decision . In Pottsville , Pa. , a company of the Pennsylvania National Guard from Scranton was billeted in the old Pershing mansion while guarding railroadbridges against the German agents , and there was an abortiveeffort to change the name of sauerkraut to Liberty Cabbage . The trench cap , an especially ugly article of men 's headgear , with a buckled belt across the top , had a sizable sale among boys and men . Women took up rolling bandages intended for the Red Cross . There was a rash of flag-raisings , with attendant speeches on patriotism , and the first Liberty Loan lapel buttons made their appearance . Charley Brickley , the Harvard drop-kicker , booted a football as high as the Sub-Treasury Building to call attention to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have raised millions by the sale of bonds . From the Pacific to the Atlantic it was impossible not to know that the war was on . " Good-bye Broadway , Hello France " was suddenly more popular than " I Did n't Raise My Boy to Be a Soldier " ; " Over There " was known to millions who were just beginning to learn " The Star-Spangled Banner " ; and there was a not too subtle warningin " Do n't Bite the Hand That 's Feeding You . " The sounds of a nation newly at war , the posters of James Montgomery Flagg , the cartoons of the Dutchman Raemekers , the jokes about the Kaiser and the Crown Prince , prepared the country for the sterner realities . " I 've thought about joining the Navy , " said Bill Ewing to Jack McNair . " Why the Navy ? " said Jack McNair . " Well , frankly , it 's cleaner , " said Bill . " From what we hear , France is a sea of mud . It rains all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a while . I 'd like to be on a submarine chaser . " " I think I would too , " said McNair . " Trench warfare has no appeal to me . But neither has any other kind of warfare . The closest I 'll get will be when my kid joins the army . He 's crazy to get in . He wants to get in the Signal Corps and be an aviator . That would n't be so bad . At least you stay out of the mud . Scotty 'll get his degree at Kenyon this June , and he 's applied for the Signal Corps . If his application is approved , he 'll go to Texas , and then I guess that 'll be the last we 'll see of him till the damn thing 's over . " " How long do you think that will be ? " " I do n't know , " said McNair . " I was talking to Colonel Abernathy about that . The British Purchasing Commission fellow . He made the point that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allies would have lost . But now that we 're in , it will take about three years to lick the Germans . The Germans had been getting ready for this war too long , and they were the only ones who were ready for it . We 're not ready for it , although we'vep136known for three years that we could n't stay out of it . Coach Wilson is to blame there . " " Coach Wilson ? " said Bill . " He coached the football team at Wesleyan before he became president of Princeton . Imagine him coaching a football team ? They must have been pretty hard up . Well , at least he sent a few thousand men to the Border and that was better than nothing . It made a first lieutenant out of Bob Hotchkiss , so the Germans better look out . The Yanks are coming . " " Is n't Bob coming back to Hotchkiss , Ewing and Kelley ? I have n't seen him around here much , " said Bill. j " In the strictest confidence , Clarence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't given him much to do . The firm is making a lot of money and can afford to pay Bob , but meanwhile you 're doing his work . If anything happens to Clarence Kelley , Bob 'll still draw pay , but if anything happens to me and Clarence , our best clients are going to look elsewhere for legal advice . The firm will collapse . Which brings me to a question : do you want to have Bob Hotchkiss for a partner ? " " I do n't think so , " said Bill . " If something happened to you and Clarence , I 'd rather go out on my own . " " I thought as much , " said McNair . " I 'm sure Bob would too . " " I suppose so , " said McNair . " That leads me to another question . How would you like to be on the board of Cuyahoga ? " " Me on the board of Cuyahoga ? " said Bill . " That 's what I said , " said McNair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cuyahoga as any man that 's now on the board . Those late nights and Sundays have paid off , Bill . They offered me a directorship and I said no , I wanted to be alawyer . But this is something you ca n't turn down . They askedme who I 'd recommend , and I suggested you . You 're young , butthat 's to your advantage . "  | " Come to me after the war , and I 'll give you an answer , " said Bill . " Unfortunately they wo n't wait that long . Three or four years from now is n't now . Three or four weeks from now is as long as they 'll wait , " said McNair . " Then you know my answer , " said Bill . " I have n't enlisted and my draft number has n't been drawn , but any day now . " " If you were on the board of Cuyahoga you could probably get an exemption , " said McNair . " And a white feather from Bob Hotchkiss , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McNair . " Bill , how would you like to be a captain ? You 'd outrank Bob Hotchkiss . " " That would be nice . How could it be arranged ? " said Bill . " Take the job on the Cuyahoga board , and go in as a captain . Or even a major . Do n't think that that ca n't be arranged , because it can . " " I knew there was a hitch to it , " said Bill . " Colonel Abernathy is n't a colonel . He 's actually a leftenantcolonel , but when the Judge Advocate General offered me a commissionback in January , I told him I 'd have to have equal rank with Abernathy . That 's how I know those things can be arranged . I thought it over for a while , then decided to remain a civilian . Gloves and a swagger stick look all right on Abernathy , but I like to work in shirt sleeves . But it 's nice to know I could have been a lieutenant-colonel . I think of myself as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ordnance . Oh , I have those moments too , when I 'd like to be in uniform . You 're not the only one . But why do n't you take the directorship on Cuyahoga ? Then later on go in as a captain ? You 're not all that anxious to stick a bayonet in some Heinie 's belly , are you ? You could do more for the Allied cause as a director of Cuyahoga . What are you thinking about ? " " I was thinking about a guy named Eddie Noisrander , " saidp138Bill . " All right , I 've changed my mind . I 'll be a director at Cuya-hoga . " Bill was on time for dinner that evening . " I want you to go out and buy yourself something expensive . Something worth about twenty times fifty-two dollars . That 's a thousand and fifty-four dollars . It can be furs or jewelry , whatever you like . " " Why the sudden generosity ? " said Edna . " I 'm all for it , but why ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , twenty is the twenty-dollar gold pieces I 'll be paid for attending directors ' meetingsat Cuyahoga Iron &; Steel . In other words , I 'm to be a director of Cuyahoga . " " That 's better than the two-and-a-half gold piece you 'd get for being a director of the Wingate Savings Bank , " said Edna . " I know , because my father used to give them all to my mother . But CuyahogaIron &; Steel ? Are n't they the ones that made you late for dinner ? " " That 's why I 'm giving you the director 's fees , " said Bill . " Tell me all about it at dinner , " said Edna . He did so , leaving out the mention of Eddie Noisrander but including the reference to a bayonet in a Heinie 's belly . " I do n't know why , but that sold me , " he said . " I do n't think I could kill anybody . There must be some Quaker in me . " " If you were me , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Edna . " My father 's mother was a Quaker from down Indiana way . Anyway , I 'm happy that you 're not going in the army . Those that live by the sword , shall perish by the sword . And I do n't mean it the way Priscilla means it . " " I 'm being inconsistent , taking the job at Cuyahoga and making munitions , but Emerson said consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds . ' I learned that from Professor Jeffries at Ann Arbor . The hobgoblin of little minds , ' he used to say , a strange thing for a law professor to say , but it came in handy . " " What will you do as a director of Cuyahoga ? " said Edna.  | " Go to the meetings and listen , " said Bill . " I 'll be the youngest director in the history of the corporation , so I 'll learn to keep my trap shut . However , after I 've learned the ropes they 'll hear from me . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Have n't I always ? " " No , because I never asked you to before . This time I 'll need luck , " said Bill . " The imponderable . " " Then I wish it to you , " said Edna . " The best of luck and a lot of it . " " That 's the way to talk , " said Bill . His mother called him a couple of days later . " I got an announcementthat you 'd been made a director of Cuyahoga . Congratulations . Did you know I had stock in Cuyahoga ? " " No , I did n't . How much stock ? " " Well , now I guess it must be worth a hundred thousand or maybe more . Clarence Kelley would know , " said Ada Ewing . " I inherited it from your father . Do you want it ? " " I do n't think so , but I may want it later , " said Bill . " Let me know when you want it , and I 'll transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you happen to be made a director ? " " I 've been working for Cuyahoga for six months or more , and Jack McNair , my boss , is in charge of their legal affairs , " said Bill . " I know the stock is coining money . I 'd hate to tell you what I 've been offered for my shares , " said Ada . " A hundred thousand ? " " That 's what it was worth when your father died , " said Ada . " I 've been offered a million for it , and Clarence told me to hold on to it . I have some other stock that you may be interested in . " " What 's that ? " " Akron Rubber . That 's been sensational . It was worth four dollars a share when your father left it to me , and now it 's wortharound sixty . I have ten thousand shares . Do you know about it ? " " Everybody knows about Akron Rubber , " said Bill . " But youmust n't go giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  | " Clarence gives me thirty-five thousand a year to spend , and I do n't really need that much . I 'm not extravagant . Your father and I lived very simply , and of course I had some Bloodgood money . Your Uncle Asa and I shared that , fifty-fifty . Unfortunately , Uncle Asa spent most of his  --  or fortunately . He had a good time doing it , drinking and women . He went through a hundred thousand dollarsby the time he was thirty , which may not seem like a great deal , but he only had nine years to spend it . Of course , he never worked , and I 've had to support him since he was thirty . You 're going to have to , too . Asa will probably live to be eighty . " " Why all this talk about money , Mother ? " said Bill . " You have n't mentioned money to me since I went up to Ann Arbor and you sneaked me fifty dollars a month allowance . " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't enough , but I never told him , " said Ada . " He used to say , See , Ada , fifty dollars a month was enough . Teaches him to be thrifty . ' Were you ever thrifty , Bill ? " " I managed to be broke on a hundred a month , so I guess I was n't , " said Bill . " But I 'm learning , and Edna is n't extravagant . Mr. Everett gives her a hundred a month and she saves nearly all of it . " " That 's being thrifty , " said Ada . " You did n't answer my question , " said Bill . " Why are you so full of money talk ? " " Because it 's really time we had some money talk . You know , Bill , I 'm not going to live forever . " " I do n't see why not , " said Bill . " Well , for one reason , I do n't want to , " said Ada . " I 'd like you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you really ? You have Edna and JohnStewart , and you 've just been made a director of Cuyahoga . It seems to me your life is full . Mine is not . I could tell you a few things about myself that you would n't like very much . " " I do n't think you could tell me anything that would greatly sur/prise me , " said Bill . " For instance , I hate to bring this up again , but are you sure you did n't have a love affair with Clarence Kelley ? " " No , I never did . " " I thought possibly you were going to tell me that I 'm Clarence Kelley 's son , " said Bill . " Well , you 're not . You 're the son of Francis Ewing and no one else . I was completely faithful to your father , from the time we were married till the day he died . I will tell you now that I sometimes wondered about that , why I did n't seem to be attractive to other men besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself thinking that if she 's so attractive to one man , why should n't she be to someone else . Even Edna , who never looks at another man , must have moments when she secretly wishes another man would fall in love with her . It 's the nature of the beast . " " I suppose it is , but I hope she never finds out it is , " said Bill . " When did you find out ? " " I told you . When I was married to your father , " said Ada . " But you never did anything about it ? " said Bill . " Not while he was alive . What I 've done since then is really none of your business . It was n't while he was alive for that matter . But at least you know whose son you are , and I suppose you 're entitled to that . Why did you think you might be Clarence Kelley 's son ? " " He 's taken such a fatherly interest in me , " said Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , and he 's old enough to have been my father . But he was n't . My mother and Clarence Kelley never knew each other . The Bloodgoods and the Kelleys did n't move in the same circles . Neither did the Bloodgoods and the Ewings , for that matter , but your father altered that . " " How ? " said Bill . " How ? Why , he was introduced to me and he made a point of seeing me , that 's how . We went on picnics together , and he made friends with your Uncle Asa , and in time we were married . Hep142got your uncle out of a couple of scrapes . He was always getting your uncle out of scrapes . " " What kind of scrapes ? " said Bill . " I 'm finding out a lot about my family that I never knew before . " " Women , " said Ada . " Your Uncle Asa was the kind of man who 'd promise to marry any woman in order to get her to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them took him seriously . Then he 'd come to your father and ask him to get him out of it . Sometimes it cost Asa money , but sometimes not . Your father could be very persuasive . " " He must have been , " said Bill . " A hitherto unsuspected side of him . " " The Cuyahoga and the Akron Rubber side of him were what you saw , before he died , " said Ada . " The side of him that protected your uncle from blackmailing females was naturally the side he did n't reveal , but he had fun outwitting them . Your Uncle Asa adored your father , and well he might . " " He was quite a man , " said Bill . " I mean  --  going to bat for Uncle Asa that way . " " Yes , " said Ada . " He understood people 's frailties " But she wondered if Francis Ewing would have found it possible to understand her frailty with Priscilla . It was more likely that he would have understood her use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of relationship she had had with Priscilla , and neither had she . He had never mentioned the kind of relationship Bob Hotchkiss must have had with the men in his company , and neither had she . And yet he had somehow known about the Priscilla relationship between two women and the Bob Hotchkiss relationship with the men in his company . How did he and she know about such relationships ? If people never talked about it , how did they know about them ? How freely she had talked about her relations with Priscilla to Clarence Kelley , and would never have talked about them to Francis Ewing . Were there people who invited such confidences and people who did not ? Soon the National Guard would be federalized and Bob Hotch/kiss would be going away to camp , and when that occurred she would know , as she did not know now , whether she was to resume the relationship with Priscilla . She had not seen Priscilla since she gave the party for Bob Hotchkiss and Clarence Kelley took Priscillahome , and there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , the weather was warm , and the dam at the farm was inviting . But Priscilla would have to make the first move , and she had not done so , and there were days when Ada did not want her to as well as days when she did . In the midst of this confusion , Bob Hotchkiss was quite suddenly sent away to camp in Georgia with his company , and Priscilla called Ada at the farm . " I wanted to talk to you , " said Priscilla . " Come out any time , " said Ada . " The farm is lovely . " " Could I come out tomorrow and maybe spend the night ? " said Priscilla . " But of course , any time , " said Ada . Priscilla had made the first move . The next day Priscilla arrived before noon , and Ada kissed her with more warmth than she was going to permit herself . " You know you 've been a naughty girl , " said Ada . " I have a husband , but thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I hope he gets sent over soon . That 's very unpatriotic of me , but it 's the truth . He got drunk the night of your party and did n't come home for two days . He did n't bother to tell me who he was with . I knew . " " Some of the boys ? " " Of course , some of the boys . He brought one of the boys home with him and made me sleep with him . How do you like that ? " said Priscilla . " You did sleep with him ? " said Ada . " I thought men like that did n't like to sleep with women . " " Well , he did . And Bob wanted him to . I guess there are a lot of things you do n't know about men . " " I guess there are , " said Ada.  | " I hate men , " said Priscilla . " So you 've come back to me , " said Ada . " It looks that way , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were together again , armsaround each other , and they remembered that one , Ada , was toperform the act of kissing . " Now let me kiss you , " said Priscilla . " Do you want to ? " said Ada . " Yes , " said Priscilla . " The same as you did me . " " I 'm glad you want to , " said Ada . " I want you to . Lie on top of me first . " " All right . Like a man ? " said Priscilla . " Just like a man , " said Ada . " Shall I do it like a man ? " said Priscilla . " Let 's try that , shall we ? " said Ada . " I ca n't go in you , but we 'll try . " " Maybe I can go in you , " said Ada . " Almost , " said Priscilla . " You 're almost in me . Oh , that 's wonderful . Do that some more , and I 'll come . Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Ada . " Oh , that is wonderful . It 's as good as coming . " I came , " said Priscilla . " I 'm still coming . You 're bigger than I am , that 's why I came . " " You did n't quite come , did you ? " " Maybe not quite , but the sensation is the same , " said Priscilla . " It 's just as good . " " It was for me too . " " How do you feel ? " said Priscilla . " Glowing . Different from with a man , but glowing , " said Ada . " Now we must get some sleep , must n't we ? I have to be back in town at nine-thirty . I have a dentist 's appointment . " " You have very nice teeth , Priscilla . You must n't neglect them , not even for me . " " I like my bosom better , " said Priscilla . " You like my bosom too . "  | " Yes , I do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he liked my bosom , " said Priscilla . " He really was n't so awful , but Bob was . He was horrible ? ' " Shall we not talk about Bob tonight ? " said Ada . " Or about that man ? Unless you want to . " " Oh , I do n't mind either way , " said Priscilla . " But you wanted to get some sleep , " said Ada . " It was Jerry Bolling , " said Priscilla . " Bob put him up to it . They came in the house both pretty drunk and Bob lifted up my skirt , right in front of Jerry , and the next thing I knew Jerry was doing it to me , and Bob was encouraging him . " " How do you mean , encouraging him ? " said Ada . " Encouraging him , " said Phyllis . " Telling him what to do . Callingme names , names I would n't repeat even to you . PushingJerry 's behind . Then Bob tried to do it and could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Ada . " No . He was soft . He could n't get an erection . All he could do was feel sorry for himself , and then he picked a fight with Jerry , and Jerry left the house in disgust . I do n't blame Jerry for doing what he did . A man tells you to have your pleasure with his wife , and you lift up your wife 's skirt , that 's the limit . I never spent such a morning in my whole life , I never did . " The story , shocking though it was , incredible though it was , and sadly humorous though it was , was self-revealing of Priscilla and her life with Bob Hotchkiss and hardly less so of Bob Hotchkiss and his life with Priscilla . Ada wanted to be free of the girl , to get her out of the house , but she wrapped her arm around her shoulder and said , " Let 's not talk about it any more . Let 's get some sleep . " The miserable , pretty creature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to abandon but now could not . In the morning Priscilla had only a cup of coffee for breakfast . " I do n't like to put a lot of food in my mouth before I see the den/tist , " she said . " I think it 's very inconsiderate . " She had a **27;13756;TOOLONG roadster and looked very pretty driving away in it , waving all the way down the lane . The Akron Tire &; Rubber Company plant was only a few miles from Cleveland as the crow flies , but Bill Ewing had never seen it . " Oh , you must have seen it , " said Jack McNair . " I must have , but I never did , " said Bill Ewing . " Well , do n't tell them that now , " said Jack McNair . " The stink kept me away , " said Bill . " Ah , then you 've been to Akron ? " said Jack McNair . " Passing through , " said Bill . " I was thinking of going to your alma mater , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that was all . I decided on the University of Michigan instead . " " The stink is a lot worse than when you were there , but all the perfumes of Arabia wo n't change that now . Reason : nobody wants to change it . They 'd rather have the profits from rubber . " Jack McNair and Bill Ewing were driving down to Akron because there was an important stockholder of Akron who was objectingto Bill 's being made a director of the company . " This fellow Ed Lustig has made millions out of Akron Rubber , and he does n't object to the stink . In fact , he probably does n't even notice it . It 's the breath of life to him . " " Poor man , " said Bill . " Poor man indeed , " said McNair . " What he principally objects to is ( a ) your youth , and ( b ) your being a Clevelander . Not that he has n't got four other Clevelanders on his board , but they 're all older men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " ( A ) , because I 'm young , and ( b ) because I 'm a Clevelander , and ( c ) because I 'm getting some stock from my mother , " said Bill . " He knows about the stock , all right , " said McNair . " Hold your nose , we 're coming in to Akron , " said Bill.  | " You hold your temper , young man . This means a lot to you , " said McNair . Ed Lustig was an affable-seeming man , who wore a wing collar and a diamond stickpin . " It 's very nice of you gentlemen to come all the way to Akron for lunch , " he said . " Do you want to wash first ? " " We stopped on the way in , " said McNair . Lustig addressed his remarks to McNair but never took his eyes off Bill Ewing , until Bill made the discovery that he was crosseyed . " Francis Ewing came in when our stock was selling at 4 , " said Lustig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I doubt if even he thought it would go to where it is now . There were times when I was n't , myself . You see that truck tire plant over there ? That was n't even built when your father passed on . Not even built . " " No , I guess it was n't , " said McNair . " You can just bet your darn tootin ' it was n't , " said Lustig . " The war was n't even started then . That building was housing the Norka plant , bicycle tires , and losing money . Losing money hand over fist . I tried to market a clincher-type tire and almost went broke doing it . But I was right about the war . I went to work and convertedthe Norka plant and then I enlarged it , and it 's still not big enough . Well , young man , some of our directors think there 's a place for you on our board . Do you know anything about bicycle tires ? " " Bicycle tires ? I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill . " Why ? " " People who ride bikes would n't take the time to change them , " said Bill . " Not even if you made the tires last twice as long ? " " Nor three times as long , " said Bill . " They just would n't take time to change a puncture . "  | " But if your clincher types are all right for an automobile , why would n't they be all right for a bicycle ? " said Lustig . " A kid riding a bike does n't have all day to change his tires , " said Bill . " Exactly . It took me four years to find that out . I guess because I did n't have a son . I only had my three daughters , " said Lustig . " Well , gentlemen , how about some lunch ? " Luncheon , consisting of steak , mashed potatoes , lima beans , and ice cream , was served in a small dining-room adjoining Lustig 's office . " I eat a steak every day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mackerel snatcher , but because I simply like steak . Half the time I do without my mashed potatoes , but I never do without my steak  --  except Friday . That one day I go without , always medium rare . " They finished their lunch and returned to the office , and Ed Lustig did not sit down . He remained standing as though the luncheon conference were over , as indeed it was . " Young man , you 'll do , " said Lustig . " Is that all ? " said Bill . " I would n't find out any more about you if I kept you waiting an hour , " said Lustig . " You can go back to Cleveland now , and I have work to do . You answered my question the right way , when I asked you about clincher types . " " What if I 'd given you the wrong answer ? " said Bill . " Well , you did n't , " said Lustig . McNair and Bill Ewing got into McNair 's Chalmers touring car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the cut of your jib , " said McNair . " Lustig is an independent cuss , and I guess you are too . I watched him when you were talking about clincher-type tires for bicycles , a pet project of his , and I thought , Ewing is spoiling his chances now . ' But you were n't . You were enhancing them , by going against everything he was in favor of . " " It was no more than the truth , " said Bill . " Yes , but how many times would a man tell the truth in suchp149circumstances ? " said McNair . " Now I have my eye on a directorate for you that may take a little longer . Sprague Chemical . " " What is Sprague Chemical ? " said Bill . " Sprague Chemical is a small firm that deals principally in nitrates , " said McNair . " Fertilizers ? " said Bill . " Another kind of nitrate . Explosives , " said McNair . " I do n't want you to say a word about this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The less you know about it now , the better . " " Who are the directors of Sprague Chemical ? " " George McVeagh , Alan Holcomb , Minor Hay , " said McNair . " Practically the same group as Cuyahoga , " said Bill . " The same money , but not as much of it . Not yet , anyway . It is n't listed on the New York Stock Exchange , and there is n't much trading in it . But there will be , later on . Frankly , it 's considered a patriotic effort on the part of George McVeagh and the others . They 've made a hell of a lot of money out of Cuyahoga and they 're willing to lose some to get Sprague started . Do n't ask who Sprague is . There is no such person . Sprague is actually a German chemist named Baer , B , a , e , r , Baer . Baer came from the Krupp Industries in the spring of 1914 and told our War Department about the war in Europe , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak so good the English , and for two years he had hard sledding becausethe Germans suspected him of being a traitor . Which , I may say , he was . Then he looked up a niece of his , who turned out to be Miss Schlatter , George McVeagh 's secretary , and Miss Schlatter arranged a meeting with George . She spoke very little German , but enough to make George understand . George checked with our War Department and they asked him how he knew about Baer . They said they 'd been trying to find him for a year , and George told them that they 'd had him in their office in Washington but nobody paid any attention to him . By that time George had given him enough money to carry on his experiments , and Baer would n't gop150to Washington , or offer his services to the War Department . He trusted George and just about nobody else , and that 's how George got first claim on his services . First and only claim . " " Where is the Sprague plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Naturally there 's a price on Baer 's head , " said McNair . " I have n't met Baer and neither have Minor Hay or Alan Holcomb . If you 're interested in the name Sprague , by the way , that was the name of George McVeagh 's old doubles partner at Harvard . He died in 1904 or ' 05 , so it would be pretty difficult to trace any connection there . A secret chemical plant named after a dead tennis player . George could have named it Chalmers , after this car . " " The car would run better if you did n't leave your choke out so much , " said Bill . " Is that what it is ? " said McNair . " I do that all the time . No wonder the carburetor 's flooded . I get to talking and I forget about the car . Would you like to drive ? " " All right , " said Bill . They changed seats and Bill took the wheel . " I can talk and drive at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Go right ahead , " said McNair . " What is the reason behind your getting me these directorships ? I know you said it was because I worked so hard on Cuyahoga , but that 's only part of the reason , " said Bill . McNair filled his pipe and lit it . " I was wondering when you might ask that question , " he said . " Hard to keep a pipe lit in the car . " I 'll wait , " said Bill . " I 'm preparing my answer , " said McNair . " I know that . That pipe comes in handy sometimes . " " Often , " said McNair . " You 're getting to know my habits too well . Your question was , why am I getting you these directorates , or directorships . Well , I 'll tell you . First of all , because I need you . I want you to be my right-hand man , someone whose judgment Ip151can rely upon and who knows my habits . My habits of thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand . ClarenceKelley was the first to bring you to my attention , because there were certain things about you that reminded him of certain things about your father . For instance , I happen to know that you were offered a good job with a New York law firm , starting as a clerk , and you turned it down because you preferred to work in Cleveland . Did you know that your father did the same thing ? He did . Twenty or twenty-five years earlier your father was offered a job with Clendenning and Clendenning , which later became Edwards , Clendenning . That seemed to indicate that you were satisfied to remain in Cleveland , which pleased me , because I 've been satisfied to remain in Cleveland . The practice of law is much the same everywhere in the United States , given certain peculiarities that make Louisiana different from , say , Rhode Island , Pennsylvaniafrom Delaware . " " Yes , " said Bill . " Be patient , we have fifteen miles to go , " said McNair . " In any case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . And the few mistakes you made were mistakes I might have made myself . So then I thought why not make this young fellow a director of Cuyahoga ? He could n't do any harm , because there are about fifteen other directorson the Cuyahoga board and even if all his ideas were cockeyed , the other fourteen would vote them all down . Also , there was the fact that your father had been on the board of Cuyahoga , and I 'm a strong believer in continuity . Cuyahoga is here to stay , and you 'd be the youngest director now , but twenty years from now you would n't be . " " That , of course , makes sense , " said Bill . " But it is n't the whole story . " " No , it is n't , " said McNair . " But let me tell it my own way . ClarenceKelley was very much in favor of your being made a director , and in fact he wished it had been his idea . But Clarence is n't an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'll back it up . Andp152he came to me about a month ago and suggested that inasmuch a your father had been a director of Akron Rubber , why not make you a director of Akron Rubber . And I said no . Cuyahoga was one thing , but Akron Rubber was different . Cuyahoga was mostly friends of your father 's , gentlemen for the most part , who belonged to the Union Club and whose wives were friends of your mother 's . Akron Rubber was a very different setup . It was run by Ed Lustig , a self-made man and a very tough customer . I could hear Ed Lustig raising the roof if they , or we , tried to put you in as a director there . Well , Clarence asked me whether I 'd mind if he had a few words to say in your favor , and I said no , I did n't mind . So he did . And whatever Clarence said , Ed was won over . " " So that 's how it was ? " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one other directorship I want you to have , and that 's Sprague , " said McNair . " Oh , hell , I might as well tell you why I want you in Sprague , and you 're not going to like it . I want you in Sprague for the same reason I wanted you in Cuyahogaand Akron Rubber . In plain language , I want you kept out of the army . " " So that 's what you 're aiming at ? I should have known , " said Bill . " I really should have known . Take the wheel , Mr. McNair . I do n't feel like driving any more . " " I have one more thing to tell you , Bill , " said McNair . " You 've told me enough for one day , " said Bill . " Will you listen to me while I tell you this ? Do n't stop the car , Bill , " said McNair . " You 've got to listen to me , you selfish kid . Do you know that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? A year , and maybe less . Ask Hendricks , he 'll tell you . Ask my wife . Everybody knows it but you . I have a thing called auricular fibrillation , and that kills you , my young hero . No , everybody does n't know . My son Scotty does n't know . But Clarence Kelley knows , and my wife , and Dr. Hendricks . And now you . " They continued the ride back to Cleveland in silence . Bill , who was still driving , said , " Shall I let you out at the office ? "  | " Of course let me out at the office . It 's only a little after three , " said McNair . " Will you be in tomorrow ? " " Yes , I 'll be in , " said Bill . " Leave the keys in the car , will you ? " said McNair . " No , I 'll give them to you , " said Bill . " I 'm coming back with you . On Sunday evenings in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetch Clarence Kelley out to the farm for supper . It was a custom that had originated during a hot spell , and was repeated nearly every Sunday . " If you had n't taken pity on me this summer , I 'd have spent many evenings at the club , all by myself , " said Clarence . " I do n't mind it in the winter , but it gets pretty deserted along about June . " They would eat their meal on the screened porch  --  chicken croquettes or a souffle , out of respect for Clarence 's dentures  --  and chat until ten o'clock , when it would be time for Clarence to go back to town . Clarence was always a good conversationalist , and if Ada suspected him of saving up topics for their Sunday evening chats , Ada did the same thing . " My dear , what is your opinion of Mr. Wilson and woman 's suffrage ? " he began one evening . " Jointly ? " said Ada . " Or separately , " said Clarence . " Mr. Wilson leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me cold . As for his interest in women 's suffrage , how could he help it , surrounded by his wife and those daughters ? His second wife and daughters . Mr. Baker is his secretary of war , but he 's anotherDemocrat , and I 'm not for anything they 're for . " " Not even woman 's suffrage ? Would n't you like to have the vote ? " said Clarence . " If I thought it would get rid of some of those Democrats . But Wilson is there till the war 's over , " said Ada . " I might be for it if the Republicans were in . " " They may be . It depends on when the amendment is voted in.  |p154That  may be just as Wilson is getting out . Then how would you feel about women 's suffrage ? " said Clarence . " I do n't think I 'd vote . But I might change . Who 's to say ? A couple of years from now I might turn into a rabid suffragette . I should worry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I ca n't really get stirred up about it on a warm summer 's evening , " said Ada . " Notice those sycamores , Clarence . I wish we had more than two of them . We had three , but one was struck by lightning last spring . " But the next Sunday evening she said , " Do you remember last Sunday , asking me what I thought of women 's suffrage ? " " I do , " said Clarence . " I found myself thinking about it all week , " said Ada . " Why should n't women have the vote ? Men have always had it , and look what condition the world is in now . You put a bee in my bonnet , Clarence . Is that what you meant to do ? " " Well , yes . All the suffragettes seem to be Democrats and you 're a good Republican . Why should they have all the fun ? " said Clarence . " Now you 're not proposing that I take an active interest in the suffragette movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where to begin . " " Why not begin at the beginning ? " said Clarence . " Have a few women in for lunch  --  " " And make a speech ? Never , " said Ada . " Not a speech . But give a talk . Explain to the women that as a Republican , you 're worried about the women 's suffrage movement being taken over by the Democrats . And then ask them whether they 're not worried too . Undoubtedly they 'll say they have n't even thought about it , one way or the other . But give them a week , and they will think about it . " " Aha , the same way you did me , " said Ada . " You 're a sly one , Clarence . " " I 've even planned your lunch for you , " said Clarence . " Not more than six . I 'd invite Jean McVeagh , because the McVeaghp155money will be necessary . Sara Holcomb , because she 's active in the Junior League . Marcia Hay , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four . " " Christine Frogg ? She looks too much like a suffragette , " said Ada . " The others I do n't object to , but Christine , with her tweed suits and capes , is a bit too much . " " Then do n't have her . But Christine is a worker , and she 'd be very pleased to be asked . She does a great deal of charity work , you know . Not the Junior League sort of thing , but with poor people that you never heard of . Five afternoons a week . And she 's a Republican . " " All right , I 'll have her , " said Ada . " When shall I have this get-together ? " " September sometime , " said Clarence . " They 're all away now , but they 'll be coming back in September . Then you can have anotherluncheon in October , and another in November , December , January , so on . " " Why me , Clarence ? Why not , for instance , Jean McVeagh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought of you first , " said Clarence . " Well , that seems to settle it , " said Ada . Clarence did not let her forget the luncheon or its purpose , and he managed to make some mention of it every Sunday evening until the last Sunday in August . " Two weeks more , " he said . " Oh , I have n't forgotten , " said Ada . " The McVeaghs will be back the day after Labor Day , and the Holcombs sometime that week . I 'm not sure about the Hays , but you can invite Christine Frogg any time . She 's been in town all summer . But Jean McVeagh is your piece de resistance , so invite her first . " " Whatever you say , " said Ada . The Monday after Labor Day was agreed upon , and at one o'clock the ladies arrived . They were all acquainted with each other , and they accordingly dispensed with introductions . " You'rep156probably wondering why I invited you four to lunch , " said Ada . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm not . My husband is , but Ah 'm a dyed-in-the-cotton Dimmocrat . Ah 'm originally from Mobile , Alabama . So maybe Ah better leave , " said Marcia Hay . " You can stay , Marcia , " said Ada . " Maybe we can win you over , or who knows , maybe you can win us over . The point is , Marcia and her Democratic friends have taken over the whole women 's suffrage movement , and I 've been wondering why we Republican women were content to sit idly by while they were doing it . " " Women 's suffrage ? It 's a long way off , " said Jean McVeagh . " Ah , but is it ? " said Ada . " So-called nice women , nice Republicanwomen , may think so , but it 's later than you think . " The luncheon lasted until two-thirty , and Christine Frogg stayed behind when the other women left . She was a rather stout woman with bobbed hair , wearing a crash suit and low-heeled shoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been interested in woman 's suffrage for years , " said Christine . " What got you inter-ested ? " " Clarence Kelley , " said Ada . " Dear old Clarence , " said Christine . " I wonder how much we owe him . I would have gone on writing bad poetry the rest of my life if it had n't been for Clarence . Then one day he came to my studio and saw some sculptures I had done and away went the poetry . A few kind words about my sculpture did it . If Clarence Kelly got you interested in woman 's suffrage there must be some good reason , and I 'm sure you have no idea what it is . " " None whatever , " said Ada . " Well , I think it 's wonderful , and I just wanted to tell you so . It 's a start , " said Christine . " Now I have to go back to my other job . I 'm a sculptress in the morning and a mission worker in the afternoon . Quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women enjoyed their luncheon ? " said Ada.  | " It was a start , " said Christine , and left . Clarence Kelley came to dinner to get a complete report on the luncheon . " I want to know everything , " he said . " What they wore , what questions they asked , everything . " Ada obliged him with the fullest report she could give , and added her guesses as to the individualwoman 's thoughts and reactions . As she finished , and they had their coffee in the library , he said , " Well , as Christine Frogg said , it 's a start . Do you want to go on with it ? " " For a while , at least , " said Ada . " How did you like Christine ? " said Clarence . " Well , I 've known her for quite a while but not well . Let 's say I liked her better this time , " said Ada . " But leaving a lot of room for improvement , " said Clarence . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to have her the next time . You do n't have to have any of the women that were here today , " said Clarence . " It might be interesting to see who you 'd invite the second time . " " Well , of today 's group , I suppose I 'd invite Christine , " said Ada . " I 'll have to have Edna Ewing and some of the younger crowd . " " " Priscilla Hotchkiss ? " " No , I do n't think Priscilla would be interested , " said Ada . " I 'm very sorry I told you about Priscilla and me . It makes me selfconsciousto mention her name . " " It makes me self-conscious too , " said Clarence . " But I know what I know , and let 's see if we ca n't turn that to our advantage . Have you wanted to see her lately ? " " Not as much , but I have her on my mind , " said Ada . " You know , of course , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see . A man would make a difference to you now . A man would probably drive Priscilla out of your thoughts , just as a man would probably drive you out of Priscilla 's thoughts . Have you thought of that ? " " I have , but what man ? " said Ada.  | " Almost any man now , " said Clarence . " Walter Finch ? " " I said a man , " said Clarence . " Dr. Hendricks ? " " Well , he 's a man , but he 's too selfish for you . You 're not suggestinganyone I think much of . I 'd suggest myself if I were thirty years younger , but I 'm not thirty years younger or twenty years younger . This man in Palm Beach , how old was he ? " " Forty-something . " " A good age for you . " " But he lives in Philadelphia , and he 's otherwise occupied , " said Ada . " The husbands of the women who were here today  --  George McVeagh , Minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jack McNair . " " Jack McNair is dying , " said Clarence . " He has less than a year to live . " " Oh , dear , does Bill know that ? " " He knows it now , " said Clarence . " Jack had to tell him . " " His heart ? " said Ada . " Acute auricular fibrillation , it 's called , " said Clarence . " Exactly what killed Francis , " said Ada . " At least they go quickly . " " So I 'm told , " said Clarence . " I do n't want to talk about Jack now . I want to talk about you , Ada . Have you wondered why I got you interested in woman 's suffrage ? " " I 've wondered a lot , " said Ada . " To distract you from your attachment to Priscilla . There 's nothing in that for you , Ada , and I do n't think you 're happy in it . Priscilla is a pretty but stupid girl , very unhappy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause trouble before she 's through , mark my word . " " Yes , I know she 's stupid , " said Ada . " Then get out of that liaison while you can , " said Clarence . " The curious thing is , I 'm sure she 's looking for a man , and wo n't have ap159hard time finding one . There are always men for the Priscillas of this world . " " Women too , I guess , " said Ada . " Yes , " said Clarence . " Ada , you 're a woman who was faithfully married to one man for twenty-some years , and he died , a little before his time but at an age that is n't unusual for a man to die at . Then followed a period of deep mourning . That in turn was followed by the affair with Priscilla , which I can partly explain by your need for somebody while you were still unwilling to be untrueto Francis ' memory . But you had an affair with the man in Palm Beach , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have had the affair if you 'd stayed in Cleveland , but Palm Beach was far enough away from your memory of Francis . The trouble is , you can pick up the telephone any time and continue having an affair with Priscilla , and every time you yield to that temptation you get in a bit deeper . In a few years , or even less , you 'll have got in so deep with Priscilla that you wo n't want anyone else . But Priscilla wo n't be so steadfast . She 'll drop you for a man , or a series of men , and you 'll be left with nobody . " " I know , I know , " said Ada . " I once told you that you know as much about women as any man alive , or words to that effect . How do you know so much ? " " How do you suppose ? " said Clarence . " I went through the same experience that you 're going through . " " But with a man ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my wife dying , like Francis , she went on living and making my life a living hell . But I went through the same period of mourning that you went through , and then it was followed by an attachment for a man much younger than I that made up for my wife 's cruelty . " " Was the man Francis Ewing ? " " Yes , it was , " said Clarence . " I was content to have a kind of avuncular relationship with him . We never took baths together . But I 've never known a man whose company gave me such pleas/ure . He was a good lawyer , if not quite a great one , and he had a hero-worship for me that I did n't quite deserve but that I tried to live up to . And I see some of the same characteristics in his son Bill . I 'll do anything to keep that boy out of the army . He must go on living . And you , Ada , must help him in every way you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ada . " I loved both of you , " said Clarence . " There , I think that 'll be enough for one night . Besides , I do n't want to keep faithful Walter waiting . " " What was the name of your sorority ? " said Bill Ewing . " Kappa Gamma Theta . Why ? " said Edna . " I have to fill out a paper saying what organizations I belong to , and it occurred to me that I do n't know the name of your sorority , " said Bill . " Kappa Gamma Theta , also known as K. G. T. , also known as Kiss George Tonight , " said Edna . " I never did kiss George . In fact , the only George I knew well enough to kiss was George Shipe , from Wingate . He came up to Ann Arbor to see me one time , but it was n't so much to see me as talk about Irma Frewling . Do you want to hear about Irma Frewling ? " " Not now , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or I 'll forget it . Irma was four or five years older than I was , and George could n't decide whether to ask her to marry him or not because he 'd heard stories about her . I 'd heard stories too . But I knew what was the matter with Irma and George did n't , so he tried to find out from me . I could n't tell him , or at least I would n't . Nice girls did n't talk about menstruating , so I did n't tell George what was the matter with Irma , but apparently she would menstruate for a month at a time . " " Why did n't you tell him she had the rag on ? That 's what they used to say at the Deke house , " said Bill . " He must have found out from somebody else , because he marriedBetty Schissler , and now they have two children , " said Edna.  | " So the story has a happy ending . What ever happened to Irma What's-Her-Name ? " said Bill . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detroit . " " Well , I hope she does n't have to stand on her feet all the time , " said Bill . " Poor Irma , " said Edna . " What paper are you filling out now ? " " It 's for the War Department records . I 've been made a directorof the Sprague company , subject to War Department approval . " " What is the Sprague company ? " " They 're doing some work for the War Department , " said Bill . " Where is it ? " " Oh , on the outskirts of Cleveland , " said Bill . " Why be secretive , Bill ? If you do n't want to tell me , just say so . " " I ca n't tell you , because I do n't know myself . " " A director of the company , and you do n't know where the company is ? " said Edna . " That often happens these days , " said Bill . " You want to know too much . " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Edna . " My husband , the big director . " They had been married over four and a half years , their son John-Stewart was three and a half years old , and it was close to the five years that they had once talked about as the limit of their residence in their present house . But wartime conditions precluded their consideration of moving , although wartime prosperity had made moving feasible . Bill was twenty-eight , making more money and known as a young man who was on his way , getting up , a fellow worth watching . His enemies  --  and he already had a few  --  were ready to say that his success was inevitable to the son of Francis Ewing , the assistant to Jack McNair , the eventual successorto Clarence Kelley . He had been made a member of the Union Club at twenty-six ; he was elected to , but declined , the presidencyof the Deke lunch club ; and he was invariably seen in the company of older men , a reliable index of his maturity.  |p162He  was diffident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think Bill Ewing likes me , " said Jean McVeagh to her husband . " And why not ? " said George McVeagh . " Ought he to kiss your hand ? " " Oh , no . Hand-kissing is n't what I want . " " Arse-kissing , then ? " said McVeagh . " That neither , " said Jean McVeagh , who was accustomed to her husband 's vulgarities . " I 'd just like him to show a little human warmth . I do n't even think he likes his mother . " " Well , now , that is bad . Everybody knows a boy 's best friend is his mother . Especially as Ada Ewing gave him all that stock . " " What stock was that , George ? " " Cuyahoga , " said George McVeagh . " And Akron Rubber for good measure . " " I knew she had a lot of Cuyahoga shares . I did n't know about the Akron Rubber , " said Jean . " Well , you know now . " " Why did she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because she does n't need it , and he does . And probably because Clarence Kelley told her to . " " Is Ada rich ? " " Ada does n't know how rich she is . That 's the truth . But as longas Clarence Kelley knows , she 'll be well taken care of . And as longas Clarence Kelley is looking out for Bill Ewing , he 'll be all right . " " Has Ada got as much as we have ? " said Jean . " Nowhere near , " said George . " But that still leaves her well off . " " She 's going to want some money from me . Not right away , but the time will come . She 's interested in woman 's suffrage . She had me and Sara Holcomb and Marcia Hay to lunch , and for some reason , that Christine Frogg . You know what that means . Money . It was while you were in Chicago , after Labor Day . " " Well , what did you and Sara decide ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give , and then decide . "  | " Very wise . But of course you know that Clarence Kelley does Ada 's thinking for her . Ada did n't think this up all by herself . She was never interested in politics . That brother of hers , Asa Bloodgood , tried to get a job in Columbus some years ago and asked her to help him . But she not only did n't know the governor  --  she did n't know who the governor was . I got that straight from Francis Ewing . " " Well , she 's made up for that . She knows now . I was quite surprised , " said Jean McVeagh . " That may be why Bill Ewing does n't like his mother , she 's a suffragette . " " Maybe , " said McVeagh . " I 'd be with him on that . " " Then I 'll stay out of it , " said Jean . Sara Holcomb , a lifelong friend of Ada Ewing 's , disagreed with Jean McVeagh 's theory that Bill did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ewing is half Bloodgood , do n't forget  --  they never seemed to get along with one another , especially Ada and Asa . But there 's strong family feeling there , " she told Jean McVeagh . " Ada supported Asa from the time he was thirty . She 'd never let him take a job that she did n't consider suitable . The resultwas , he never did take a job . Asa wanted to go to work managingthe new hotel , and he might have been good at it . But Ada said they only wanted the Bloodgood name , and no Bloodgood had ever been in the hotel business . The hotel caught fire and burned to the ground , and Asa took that as an omen . At least he never tried to get a job after that " " I do n't see what that has to do with Bill , " said Jean . " I 'm coming to that , " said Sara Holcomb . " As far as I know , Bill has never asked his mother for anything . But for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of Michigan , without his asking her to . His father gave him fifty dollars a month , and that was n't enough for a Bloodgood , so she gave him an extra fifty , without telling Francis . And goodness knows how much Cuyahoga stock and Akron Rubber she 's givenp164him . Bill would go on not asking her , because Ada will give it to him anyway . Anything he gets from her has to be of her own volition , and I think that 's nice . " Marcia Hay , who had known Ada Ewing less long than Jean McVeagh , did not participate in the discussion . " Bill is n't as loving and affectionate to Ada as my brother Robert is to my mother , but that 's the way Yankee boys are , " said Marcia Hay . " On top of which , Ada is n't the soul of affection herself . " Bill Ewing , whose affection or lack of it for his mother was the innocent cause of the discussion , would not have believed that any woman aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The men in his life were a different matter . Jack McNair . Clarence Kelley . Leftenant Colonel Abernathy , of the British PurchasingII Commission . Stanley Nork of the Cuyahoga legal department . Ed Lustig , of Akron Rubber , George McVeagh , men whom he might see for an hour a week , but who would be in his thoughts a disproportionatelength of time , made him a busy man . He was fondest of Jack McNair , the man who had told him he was dying , then never again spoken of his illness . He had the greatest admiration for Clarence Kelley , whom he had once thought to be his father . He liked , without affection , Stanley Nork . He respected , without admiration , Ed Lustig . He wanted Leftenant Colonel Abernathy to like him , without knowing why . And George McVeaghwas so rich that Bill could not think of McVeagh without automatically associating him with wealth . They were good men to be doing business with . Clarence Kelley , because he was so old , could be trusted , and McNair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live . Ed Lustig could not be trusted because nobody trusted him and never had . George McVeagh could be trusted in money matters under half a million . Stanley Nork was trustworthy under fifty thousand . Leftenant Colonel Abernathyhad no price but a K. B. E. at the end of the war to match his father 's . It was a personal profession , and trust was essential in it . Ap165mutually trustworthy relationship saved time and enabled the principals to proceed with the transaction , leaving the details of legal language to be worked out later . Bill Ewing , under the influence of Jack McNair , had learned to trust most of the men he dealt with , and to tie them down by the terms of the actual contracts , which were not always exactly as the other principals had understood them to be . As a result , Bill was accused of sharp practice , but sharp practice was not dishonest practice . " You are a son of a bitch , " said Stanley Nork on one occasion . " You slipped one over on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Bill . " We 're both working for Cuyahoga . " " We are now , but I 'm a union man , " said Stanley . " I know that , I 've known it all along , " said Bill . " If you try to slip one over on me on how much overtime you 're entitled to , I wo n't let you get away with it . I know , for instance , that you 'd like to be able to say to the union that you got them that overtime , but I 'm just as anxious to be able to tell the company that I prevented it . When the war 's over and you 're a union lawyer , I 'll fight you . But I do n't like fighting you when you 're being paid by the company . So who 's the son of a bitch , Stanley ? " " You could have me fired , " said Stanley . " Maybe I could , but I 'd rather have you where I can keep an eye on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you . Ruth 's having another baby . But do n't think that makes me forever grateful , " said Stanley . " The only thing you should be grateful for is that I caught you , but it 's too late for that , " said Bill . " You 're God damn right it is , " said Stanley . " You 're a Catholic , are n't you ? I thought they were against the Socialists , " said Bill . " I was never much of a Catholic . I guess I cared too much for poop-tang . Those girls at Ann Arbor settled my religion , and those professors changed my politics , " said Stanley . " Do you remember Eddie Noisrander at Ann Arbor ? "  | " Yes . " " He 's with the Heinies , " said Stanley . " I know , " said Bill . " Have you heard from him ? " " I would n't hear from him . He was one of your Psi U 's , " said Stanley . " But I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heinies . He was a Psi U and one of your rich bastards , but he was as much out of it as I was , a Polack from Hamtramck with a strong back and a weak mind . That 's what they used to say about us , the ones that played football . Why did Eddie Noisrander join the German army ? Do you know ? " " I guess he just happened to be there at the beginning of the war , " said Bill . " I do n't really know . " " I think it was because he felt out of it at Ann Arbor , " said Stanley . " I did too . But they were paying for my education , so I kept quiet . But I do n't ever go back . They used to ask me to go back and make speeches before football games , but fuck them . Quid pro quo . I got my education out of them , and they got twentyeightgames of football out of me , plus the fact that it cost me two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered why Eddie Noisrander joined the German army . " " Your guess is as good as mine , " said Bill . " Yes , it could be even better , Bill . Socialists think better because they think , " said Stanley . " They think like Socialists , you mean , " said Bill . Bill used his own judgment about informing Jack McNair that Stanley Nork was a Socialist . He decided against telling McNair for two reasons : he could keep an eye on Nork , and he felt confidentof being able to handle him ; and , second , there was no use giving McNair anything extra to worry about . McNair seemed to be healthy , but Bill was more alert to signs of deterioration , and he began to detect such signs ever since McNair had told him about his heart . For one thing , McNair was short of breath . Apparently it was painless , and McNair did not complain about it , but more frequently than in the past year Bill would step into McNair'sp167office and find him not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were taking a moment 's rest . He would be looking out the window , seated at his desk with some papers in front of him , but paying no attention to the papers or to the people in the office building across the street . On such occasions he would seem not only dead tired but anticipating a strain that was yet to come . Upon Bill 's entrance into the office McNair would take up his work , saying nothing about his condition , but faintly relieved or faintly irritated by Bill 's appearance . There were other signs as well , indications that he was giving Bill more responsibility , assigningchores to Bill that he previously had taken on himself . Most significantly , McNair left the office at six o'clock every evening . Then one day in November the inevitable occurred . It was late in the afternoon and McNair had stopped to fill his pipe while talking to Bill . A strained look came over his face and his voice was gentle as he said , " I think you 'd better get me to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hendricks , who was making his hospital rounds , and left word with him . Then he helped McNair on with his overcoat and the two took a taxi to the hospital . " It came sooner than I expected , but I guess it always does , " said McNair . He put his hand on Bill 's knee . " Thanks for everything , Bill , " he said . At the hospital Dr. Hendricks awaited them in the reception room . " How 're you feeling , Jack ? " said Dr. Hendricks . " Shaky , " said McNair . " Shaky and weak . No pain to speak of . " " I have a private room for you , " said Dr. Hendricks . " You can be quiet there . The nurse will help you get undressed . Your wife is on her way . " " Do n't tell Scotty until you have to , " said McNair . " Scotty ? Oh , your son . No , I 'll leave that to your wife . As soon as Mrs. McNair gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hell he can . The hell  --  he  --  can , " said McNair . " You heard what the boss said , " said Bill . It was the last speech McNair made to Bill . He died in his sleepp168two days later , and notwithstanding wartime conditions he was given a large funeral , larger than Bill had anticipated . Scotty was in England , learning to fly the planes of the Royal Flying Corps , and Bob Hotchkiss could not get leave ; but Leftenant Colonel Abernathy was present , as were six or seven members of Alpha Delta Phi from Kenyon and four Kenyon trustees ; George McVeagh , Alan Holcomb , Minor Hay , Anton Czerniewicz , Stanley Nork , Edgar Ennis , representing Cuyahoga ; Priscilla Hotchkiss ; Heidi Schlatter , representing her uncle , Valdemar Baer ; Ernie Herrick , steward at the Union Club ; Mrs. Hendricks , the doctor 's wife ; and various fat and thin people who represented various periods of Jack McNair 's life in Cleveland . After the funeral the body was put on the train for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the McNair family had a plot , and those who were able went to the home of Mrs. Francis Ewing for afternoon tea . " You 'll have to tell me the names of most of these people , " said Ada . " Well , I 'll try , " said Clarence Kelley . " I see one you 'll know . " " Priscilla . Yes , I noticed her at the church , " said Ada . " She was sitting with Edna . " " Edna is going to have a busy time from now on , " said Kelley . " Why ? " " I 've decided to make Bill a full partner . Why not ? He 's been doing Jack McNair 's work , he 's a director of Cuyahoga , a director of Akron Rubber , and a director of Sprague . He 's not too young , although that will be the objection to him at first . But the sooner he gets used to being a full partner , the more valuable he 'll be to the firm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I was a full partner in the original firm when I was only thirty-two . Francis was one at thirty-three . Hotchkiss was n't one till he was forty or thereabouts , I do n't remember . This is essentially a young firm . Jack McNair was offered a full partnership when he was about thirty-five . " " Why did he turn it down ? " said Ada.  | " Frankly , he was afraid he might start drinking again , and he did n't want the responsibility . He was paid as much as a full partner , and heaven knows he did a full partner 's work . It 's settled , Ada . The announcement will be forthcoming in a month or so . " " Does Bill know ? " " No . I want you to have the pleasure of breaking the news to him , " said Kelley . " It 'll come better from you , " said Ada . " I want him to hear it from your lips , " said Kelley . " However , there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I 'm going to make Bob Hotchkiss a partner , " said Kelley . " I have to , to maintain the name of the firm , Hotchkiss , Ewing and Kelley . It 's a whim of mine , and I hope it turns out all right , but if it does n't I wo n't be around to see it fail . I ca n't take up any more of your time now . " " When shall I tell Bill ? " said Ada . " Tonight , this afternoon , whenever you like , " said Kelley . " One more question . Who 's going to tell Bob Hotchkiss ? " " Oh , I 'll write him a letter next week , " said Kelley . The gathering of the friends of Jack McNair was mercifully brief . Although Cleveland was a large city , most people went home to supper , not dinner , and did so in time for the early movie , bed by ten or ten-thirty . People got more sleep , worked longer hours , spent more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleveland , and the lights in the shop windows along Euclid Avenue went out at eleven o'clock . Ada 's brother Asa Bloodgood had stayed for dinner after the McNair gathering , and he was so entertaining that Ada put off making her announcement to Bill until past ten o'clock . Then she said , " It 's getting past my bedtime , Asa , and I want to talk to Bill . " " I was just leaving , " said Asa , who was doing nothing of the kind , but he left . " We ought to go , too , " said Edna.  | " Not till you hear what I have to say , " said Ada . " It 's for both of you , Edna . Bill , you 're to be made full partner in Hotchkiss , Ewing and Kelley . Clarence told me this afternoon , and wanted me to tell you . " Bill was silent for a moment , then he looked at Edna and smiled . " I told you , " said Bill . " I made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were expecting it ? " said Ada . " Let 's say I was counting on it . Expecting it is another matter , " said Bill . " Expecting it , counting on it , it 's good news . How old was Dad when he became a partner ? " " Thirty-three , Clarence told me , " said Ada . " I do n't know whether I 'm not supposed to tell you this , but Bob Hotchkiss is to be made a partner too . " " Oh , that 's all right , " said Bill . " As long as I got there first . Bob 's thirty-three or four . Clarence and I will run things while Bob 's away , and maybe by the time he gets back there 'll be other changes made . Hotchkiss , Ewing and Kelley . That sounds pretty good . I assume that Bob has n't been told . " " Clarence will let him know by letter next week , " said Ada . " I suppose there 'll be one or two resignations from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young to be made a partner , but Jack McNairdid n't think so . " " No , and Clarence Kelley does n't think so either , " said Ada . " We ought to celebrate with some champagne . " " You have n't said a word , Edna , " said Bill . " Are n't you pleased ? " " I do n't see why Bob Hotchkiss is to be promoted . He has n't done anything , " said Edna . " No , but he 's a Hotchkiss , and I understand Clarence 's thinking , " said Bill . " If Bob were passed over , he 'd no doubt resign from Hotchkiss , Ewing and Kelley . " " All right , let him , " said Edna . " You 've earned your promotion , while Bob was doing nothing . Now is the time to form a new firm , Ewing and Kelley . What if Clarence should die while Bob is in the army ? Then it 'd Hotchkiss and Ewing , without the Kel/ley , and Bob would come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm inclined to agree with Edna , " said Ada . " The war wo n't last forever , " said Bill . " Let 's do it Clarence 's way for the present , and see what happens . " " Well , let 's put off having the champagne till then , " said Edna . " Suits me , " said Bill . " That being the case , it 's time we went home , " said Edna . " Goodnight , Mrs. Ewing . " The reason Bob Hotchkiss could not get leave was that his division embarked for France on November 30 . Priscilla went to New York to see him off , and returned to Cleveland without having slept with him . But she spent the night with Jerry Bolling , and the logical person to tell was Ada Ewing . " I think Jerry 's in love with me , " said Priscilla . " Would n't that be funny ? I went to New York to sleep with Bob , but I end up in bed with Jerry . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Ada . " Well , you knew about Jerry , about how he slept with me in front of Bob . That awful experience . But it was different this time . He was sailing the day after Bob sailed , and Bob was so frightened about going to France that he simply could n't have an erection . So he said why did n't I sleep with Jerry , and of course I said no , but I did . I hope I 'm not pregnant , but if I am , Jerry 's the man . It would certainly be interesting if Jerry got killed and Bob gets credit for being the father . I 'm due next week , and I 'm always on time , so I 'll know then . When are we going to the farm again ? " " To the farm ? I do n't know , " said Ada . " I still like you , Ada . I hope you like me , " said Priscilla . " I kept thinking about you . Do you know who else likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She asked me to pose for her , in the nude . I said I was afraid somebody would recognize me , but she positively assured me thatp172that would n't be necessary . She 'd change my features . So I went to her studio and posed for her . Do you mind ? " " Why should I mind ? " " Well , I thought you  --  I do n't know , " said Priscilla . " Have you told her anything about us , Priscilla ? " said Ada . " Well , I told her we took a bath together . I did n't tell her about the other time , " said Priscilla . " All I told her was that we took a bath together , one hot summer 's day . " " How long ago did you tell her that ? " " Oh , I guess it was a month ago , " said Priscilla . " Who else have you told ? " said Ada . " Nobody . " " Have you taken a bath with Christine ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was posing for her in the nude anyway , so she got in the tub with me . She had to stand up . There was n't room for both of us . " " Did you kiss her ? " " No . She kissed me , but I did n't kiss her . She wanted me to , but I did n't . I 'll only kiss you , down there . She practically pleaded with me , but I would n't . " " Does she always kiss you ? When you pose for her ? " said Ada . " I guess so . Are you jealous ? " " Yes , I suppose I am , " said Ada . " You need n't be . She does things to me , but I do n't do them to her , " said Priscilla . " A man does things to me , but I like it better when you do . I could do without men for the rest of my life . " " I do n't think I could , Priscilla . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not forever . Could you do without me ? " said Priscilla . " That 's not a fair question , when you 're sitting here and lookingvery pretty . " " Let 's go out to the farm , " said Priscilla.
