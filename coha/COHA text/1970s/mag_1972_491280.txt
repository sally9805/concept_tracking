Montreat , North Carolina . It is a pure morning , alive with mountain light . We are in the living room of Billy Graham 's eyrie , thirty-six hundred feet above the valley floor , clustered with rhododendron higher than a stag 's head . Back of the house looms the mass of the Blue Ridge Mountains , rising steeply higher than the house . Framed in the picture window of the big living room , a couple of miles away straight across , are the sawtooth peaks of the Black Mountains . The ride up the mountain had been along a road scarcely wide enough for even one car , and graded like a ski run , with steep drops every so often only six inches from the hubcaps , into gorges cut by tumbling streams or minor rock avalanches . I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills , from whence cometh my help . Billy Graham is in his study on the long-distance phone , and we have a chance to look around before he greets us . This is a spacious house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a porch overhang , valley and forest views from every window . Not another dwelling in sight  --  at this height there seems to be more sky than one sees from below . The smells of pine , and newly fallen leaves carpeting the forest blend in the senses with the sighted green of conifers tall as the masts of ships , and oaks bravely clinging to leaves sometimes still golden and once or twice flaring a last flame of scarlet . The Graham living room is what any man or woman , not utterly bereft of his senses , could call home and mean it . The fireplace is huge . Burned into the mantel is the legend : Eine fesle Burg ist unser Gott . . . a mighty fortress is our God . The beams of the ceiling are enormous , and bear the marks of the woodman 's axe which shaped them . The floor is of burnished brick , imperishable and gaining beauty with use  --  every step adds to the patina . Books , books , everywhere . Antiques in this country where an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands and left to those who follow . A grand piano in the corner . Of the five Graham children brought up in this beautiful place , only Nelson , aged thirteen , still lives at home . On the piano rack , as it turns out , is his music : " America the Beautiful " and " 0 Little Town of Bethlehem , " the latter scored in musical color phonetics for easy reading . On the walls the visual history of this family in primitive portraiture and artifacts . Billy Graham 's grandfather , Crook Graham , had been a Confederate soldier , and carried a Union bullet around in him as a reminder of that fracas , which perhaps led to his reputation for getting drunk and staying drunk every Sunday , and for his habit of blasting away with his fowling piece in the general direction of any young inen who came calling on his daughters . Billy 's grandfather on his mother 's side , Ben Coffey , was a one-legged , one-eyed veteran of Pickett 's Charge at Gettysburg , one of the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunt the Graham home . And blending with it in a strangely charming harmony are the Oriental silks and cloisonne china of Mrs. Graham , Ruth McCue Bell , the daughter of Virginia parents , who was born in North China where her father , a Presbyterian surgeon , was helping to build and develop a substantial missionary hospital despite civil wars and Japanese occupation . ( A book about him , A Foreign Devil in China , has just been released . ) The Post interviewers have never before met Billy Graham in person . They realize that William Franklin Graham , Jr. , may very well be the best-known man in the world today . He is the greatest personal phenomenon of the age . Graham stands uniquely as a modern preacher , yet there is something historical about him in his impact upon people , something which calls to mind intimations of a Paul of Tarsus , a Martin Luther , a Zwingli , a John Wesley , and in our time a Moody or a Sankey . Billy Graham would obviously shrink to be compared to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start a new sect or movement : his driving urge is to revive the thrust of fundamental Christianity . But just the same , his stature calls to mind these great religious figures of the past  --  his influence upon great numbers of people , and in this he easily surpasses them all in their finest hours . In his crusades alone he has preached to more than forty-three millions of people , face to face , in above fifty countries and in every state in the Union . This does not even begin to include the additional millions he has reached via TV- he has made personal appearances on such shows as " Laugh-in , " and the comedy hours of Jack Benny , Bob Hope Show , Woody Allen , and Johnny Carson . and the conversation somehow gets around to Jesus Christ every time . His syndicated column , " My Answer , " appears in forty-six papers with a daily circulation of twenty-two million people . His book , Peace with God , has sold over two million copies in thirty-eight languages . Among others he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be more timely and is already a best-seller . In the natural course of his work , stared at and interviewed wherever in the world that he goes , it is nothing for Billy Graham to fill a sports stadium accommodating more than 100,000 spectators until the tiers groan with standees and others clinging to the rafters . In Africa , a corps of black policemen called out to handle the surging crowds fell down on their job somewhat when it was discovered that most of them deserted their posts in order . to answer Billy 's call to come forward and make a stand for Jesus . In London , battered and bruised after hours of trying to stave off the affectionate mobs attempting to get close to Billy , one bobby was so close to the end of his strength that he was heard to gasp : " If these are Christians , let 's send out a call for some lions . " Billy has preached to sailors on aircraft carriers at sea , to soldiers at the front in Vietnam , and when he appeared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets and approached 200.000 in number . The New York Times reported that Billy had turned the " Crossroads of the world . . . ' into a great cathedral . " He has discussed the afterlife with Princess Margaret and with a queenly lady of 106 in New Zealand . He has rubbed noses with a Maori chieftain Down Under , * and elbows with the last five residents of the White House . The Archbishop of Canterbury wrote that " Dr. Graham has taught us all to begin again at the beginning . " In Australia , the Sydney Daily Mirror reported Magistrate A. E. Debenham as saying : " The Billy Graham Crusade has cut crime in parts of Sydney by an estimated 50 percent . " The Archbishop of Sydney declared that " his message is that of the Evangel , God 's great Good News for men who are lost and in need . " On a certain flight in a small plane in Nairobi , one of the pilots was puzzled by the downward drag of the tail . He investigated and found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had his Bible open and was explaining the parable of the sower . The great and the simple alike seem to be drawn to Billy Graham . Winston Churchill , a man no one has ever accused of being lacking in intellect , said to Billy : " I do not see much hope for the future unless it is the hope you are talking about , young man . We must have a return to God . " Graham knows precisely where he stands in this matter : " You ca n't come to God head first . There must be a response from the whole man , which means his intellect , will and emotion . " That may well be the secret to Billy Graham . Make no mistake about it , this is no hillbilly boy from the North Carolina backwoods who suddenly took to religion , but when he got the Call , he got it to stay and has been following a simple creed ever since . This fifty-one-yearold man is a student and an intellectual . His study is crammed with religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible concordances , the sermons of great pastors of Europe and America , the philosophies of the world . His office complex down in the Mont rea t valley has a library of even greater depth , perhaps 10,000 volumes covering every nuance and fact concerning the history and meanings of religion . And Billy Graham is also " with it " On his bookshelves are also From a Black Brother , by Manuel L. Scott ; The Feminine Mistake , by Cal Sarnra ; When God Was Black , by Bob Harrison ; and something the Lib girls might look into  --  Women Who Made Bible History , by Harold J. Ockenga . Thus , Billy Graham has managed to reach and to touch spiritually the high and the low . Longhaired kids have turned up to jeer and wave smutty placards and remained to pray with him . President Nixon has openly admitted that he sought Billy 's counsel before deciding to run in the last election . But maybe the most touching story of all concerns Dwight Eisenhower . A five-star general who directed the greatest battlefield in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a President of the most powerful country in the world . ( The whole story , in fact , has yet to be told of the strength and certainty of Eisenhower 's personality , which wasnot always projected in his public appearances . ) Yet , when Billy Graham visited General Eisenhower just before his death , the grand old man asked him to explain how he could know his sins were forgiven and that he was going to Heaven . Billy told him , quietly . And the General replied : " Thank you . I 'm ready . " Mrs. Graham has been chatting with us . She tells us that all of their five children were reared in this soaring mountain retreat . Virginia ( born in 1945 , now Mrs. Stephan Tchividjian ) mother of three of the Graham grandchildren ; Anne Morrow ( Mrs. Dan Lotz , 1948 ) ; Ruth Bell ( 1950 and now Mrs. Ted Diener() ; William Franklin , Jr . ( 1952 ) who , according to his father , currently seems to be leaning to becoming a tennis professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Ruth Graham is slender , charming , and aristocratic . They met as undergraduates at Wheaton College and were married in 1943 , following a first blind date and a period when Billy wooed her with all of the ardor which has captivated millions since . Ruth smilingly remarks that her husband is better looking today than when she first met him . At that time he struck her as something of a " beanpole . " But his spiritual stature was already maturing . " There was a seriousness about him ; there was a depth . He was much older in every way than the other students on the campus . He was a mature man , he was a man who knew God ; he was a man who had a purpose , a dedication in life ; he knew where he was going . " Billy 's official biographer , John Pollock , says that Ruth more than anyone broadened Graham 's mind . " She had no need to polish his manners or graces , but she was cultured , traveled , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from degenerating into stuffy solemnity , and preserved from extinction the light touch , the slice of small boy . Moreover , Ruth and her family , loyal Presbyterians , eased Billy Graham from his unspoken conviction that a vigorous Scriptural faith could not dwell within the great denominations . " Ruth is radiant when she talks about him , and quite obviously she likes to do nothing better . ( We recall two stories about the young-married Grahams . One , that he had the bachelor habit of using the bathroom door as a towel rack and she has n't broken him of it yet , after twenty-nine years together . Another , that one time when he was attending a church service without her , Billy absent-mindedly dropped a ten-dollar bill into the collection plate instead of the one dollar he had reached for . Afterwards , when he glowingly reported the donation to her , Ruth set matters straight by pointing out that in the eyes of God he only rated one dollar 's worth of generosity , based on what he had really meant to give . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has just returned from England , and shortly he will go to Liberia , the Far East , and then to Africa . We suspect that our interview is sandwiched in between a thousand other pressing matters . There is no evidence of this as he comes into the room calmly and unhurriedly to welcome us . This is a commanding man . Well over six feet , tanned , lean and fit . Today , he is dressed in a black and white checked sports jacket with wide lapels , a figured shirt with wide collar and tie to match , black trousers , socks and moccasins , with the bottom of the slacks even slightly flared . But the message gets across fast  --  looks mean nothing to this man . He is concerned only with the confrontation of spirit . His concentration is such a major part of his intellectual capacities that you can almost feel it . He moves easily and relaxes into a comfortable posture on the sofa in front of the fireplace . One gets the impression that an interview is a game with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposes to win . He faces the music with relish . England and Liberia are forgotten . He is 100 percent absorbed in the Here and the Now . As Billy Graham talks , a tremendous surge of sincerity and energy comes out of him . He gestures broadly as he talks , but the movements are not so much melodramatic as footnotes to what he is saying  --  a cartoonist picturing Billy Graham conversing would be tempted to draw electrical sparks shooting out from his long fingertips , the dynamics of his thought seem to be powered there . He laughs easily during the lighter moments of the interview . At only one point  --  when he is deep in his remarks about the afterlife  --  does he step out of the role of a celebrity answering a few questions put to him . Then he is dwelling on eternal truths , and utterly without being conscious of it , he glances upward for the briefest moment as if to check out Truth where it really lives . His emotional power , even held to a calmly conversational level , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man secure in what he believes , who has not wavered over the years , and who never will . That kind of inner strength is awesome . It is undoubtedly felt by all of the millions who have listened to him . This morning , in the room blazing with mountain sunlight , it is a kind of living force : Post : It has been suggested , because of your frequent appearances with President Nixon , that there is some political connection implied here . For instance , he accompanied you on your recent homecoming visit to the place you were born , North Carolina . Do you have any response to these observations ? Billy : Well , my association with the President is based purely on friendship . As a matter of fact , I am a registered Democrat . Even my wife does not know how I voted in the last election . I was a little afraid that the news media might give the occasion some political interpretation , but they did n't . The New York Times and the Washington Post ran it right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have a word of politics in it . The President was wonderful . They had signs throughout the city that were going to say " Welcome Mr. President , " but he made them take them down . Some local politicians who happened to be Republicans wanted a little meeting on Air Force I after it was all over . The President cancelled that too . He said to me : " No , this is your day and I 'm not going to let politics spoil it . " He and I rode along with all these thousands of people on each side of the car , and he even told me how to wave . For example , he said to touch them with the palms turned backward  --  this way you ca n't hurt them by getting your hand pushed back , and you wo n't hurt your hand either . Little things like that , you know . This I did n't know , because you know I 'm not used to it . It was quite a treat for me to be back in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post : Have you written any articles recently ? Billy : This year I have only done one . I just ca n't keep up with it . This year I had to put all of my energies into a book that 's just been published. * I do all of my own writing . Post : We 'd like to ask you a direct personal question . Surely these hills are inspirational to you , living here , retreating here . Do you lift up your eyes and gain strength sometimes in the mornings ? Billy : Yes , but that would be afternoon  --  I 'm not a morning man . I get up between seven and eight in the morning  --  my wife usually wakes me up with a cup of coffee  --  and then I try to go out and have devotions with my little son before he goes off to school . This house of course was built for a big family , five children in all . Now they 're all gone except one . Nelson is thirteen . We have another son who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in college part of the time and this semester he took off to work at a hospital in Jordan . He worked all summer in Israel , and now he 's working at a hospital right on the Syrian border . He got interested in this little hospital run by only two missionaries and he 's working there with his roommate from college . We have three married daughters , and , hopefully , we will all be home for Christmas . Between now and Christmas I have a very heavy schedule because I have to go to the Far East and I wo n't get home until about five days before Christmas . Right after Christmas Ruth and I will go to Africa to attend the inauguration of the President of Liberia . We 're going with Mrs. Nixon and will represent the President . Then we 'll be ready for a vacation . We take one every January . Post : Do you have a special place ? Billy : We go down to a little island in the Caribbean . We have friends who for many , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jamaica , but now we go to St. John 's down in the Virgins at Laurance Rockefeller 's development there . We have a marvelous two weeks every year and we never let anything interfere with it . Post : We 're fascinated by your health dynamic . I know you 're a jogger because one of your friends told us he could n't keep up with you . He had the nerve to say he 'd go jogging with you . Then you passed him like a deer and he gave it all up . Billy : Well , the problem is , I do n't jog , I run.1 run on a stopwatch , rather than taking the long time of four or five miles like some of the people do . I try to run a mile and a half , on the average . I do a mile on level ground at sea level in about six minutes . Up here , it takes me about eight minutes to do a mile because of the altitude . Post : Where did this come from ? Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball was my sport in those days . But when I took up running later on , I used to run three miles a day . I got out of the habit of it for a time but I 'm back on it now once again . I run every day wherever I am . I play golf when I can . Post : A good game ? Billy : Well , I have a handicap of ten , anyway . Post : What is your weight and height ? Billy : A strict 176 , and I 'm six-feet-two . But my wife has been feeding me so well since I 've been home the last week that I 'm afraid I 've gained an inch around my middle . Post : We 're very interested in a remark you made in one of your articles concerning your fondness for sports . You mentioned St. Paul , and a reference of his to the Olympics . Did he really say that ? Billy : Yes , he made a number of references in * The Jesus Generation which he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorruptible , whereas in the Olympics they were competing for a corruptible crown . Then in the twelfth chapter of Hebrews , he talks about the great crowd of witnesses that watches as we continue the race of life . He indicated that he is really talking about a big stadium , like the Colosseum in Rome , where the spectators sit in the stands watching as we finish the race of life . I believe from that passage that Christians can have encouragement that those that have gone on before are now watching us ; they can see us , and watch us as we finish the race of life . Ruth Graham : It sure would be nice if you could hear them cheer occasionally . Billy : smiles affectionately at his wife 's sally ! . She 's a much better Bible student than I am . We were both in college at the same time . She was a junior and I was a freshman . I 'd been preaching some . I had been in Bible School in Florida and she was a missionary 's daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in fact his life story comes out in book form right this week , A Foreign Devil in China by Zondervan Publishing in Grand Rapids , Michigan . They 're the biggest religious publishers in the country . And they 're publishing my new book . I 've been with Doubleday all these years , but many years ago  --  twenty years ago-1 made a commitment that I would do a book for Zondervan and I wrote this book . They are just going all out , and they have sold 135,000 copies before it ever appeared in book stores , I 've already started a new book for Doubleday but this little book is called The Jesus Generation . It is addressed to young people and it is about young people . I have tried to interpret youth to the older generation and the older generation to youth . It covers the whole range of what I want to say about young people and what I feel about young people and my advice to young people . Past : We want to ask you whether you think there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some faith among young people ? Do you feel that the pessimism is turning now to something more positive than , say , five or ten years ago when they were really lost , really silent , and really out ? Billy : Yes , I think that it is . A great many American young people are suddenly turning to Christ . It is still a minority , but it is growing rapidly . I It may be the answer to the prayers of millions of Christians who have been praying for spiritual awakening . The vast majority of American young people are still alienated , uncommitted and uninvolved . There is a deep vacuum within them . They are searching for individual identity . They are searching for a challenge and a faith . Whoever captures the imagination of the youth of our generation will change the world . Youth movements of the past have been perverted and led by dictators and demagogues . Perhaps the American young people will be captured by Jesus Christ . I say to them : If you are from fifteen to twenty-two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number over thirty million  --  you are probably still wrapped in educational swaddling clothes and taking subjects under the general heading of " preparation for life . " The trouble is : you believe you are ready for life . Ideals ? You have bales of them . You see men dying in wars around the world . You see crime , disease , and violence in cities , suburbia , and country . You see diseases unhealed and hunger unsatisfied . Why ? you ask . And no one answers ! Already , many of you have moved from what Professor Reich of Yale calls Consciousness 1 and Consciousness II into the state of consciousness he calls Consciousness Ill . Consciousness III people are determined to build a better world . But you are powerless , as you soon discover . You are shackled by financial , social , and familial checkreins . I see that you are impatient . I see that you are angry , and I say that you will have your chance to change the world . I say that you can succeed in your dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation in history has succeeded for several reasons : Because you have a better education . Because you are brighter than earlier generations . Because you are healthier and will live longer . Because you and your friends , by the thousands , are discovering Jesus Christ . When I was your age , I felt almost exactly as you do . As a teenager , I had a rebellious heart and mind , too . I lived on a farm in North Carolina where I was the oldest son in a devout Presbyterian family . Each morning I was required to milk ten to twenty dairy cows before breakfast , and I had to attend every worship service conducted at the Presbyterian church to which my parents belonged . I secretly rebelled against both , My scene was the farm but my " thing " was baseball and girls . My idea of a really cool evening was racing along in my father 's car with a pretty girl at my side . I loved . I hated . I walked on clouds . I groveled in despair . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be falling apart . The Great Depression of the thirties was on . Hitler was on the march across Europe . Ethiopia had fallen to Mussolini . Manchuria had been invaded . A few " ridiculous " people were predicting a second world war , but most " experts " were certain that things would work out and that the world was in for a long era of peace . Hundreds of thousands of unemployed people walked the streets looking for work . The heads of families sold apples on street corners . I understood little and resented my parents , my teachers , my humdrum life as a farmhand and high-school student . There has always been a gap between the generations  --  and there always will be . I rather expect it was meant to be . It is normal and wholesome and good when the young are taught to respect age . and when the older generation , assuming the responsibilities that come with age and experience and wisdom , understand the young and guide and support them without stifling . When this gap is distorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it becomes an unhealthy and abnormal situation . This is what is happening today . In the sixties and early seventies the biggest generation bomb in history dropped , detonated , and the explosion gouged a crater which was officially named ? " the generation gap . " Before the fallout was over , sociologists , psychologists , psychiatrists , and statisticians were analyzing , studying , and dissecting both generations . The modern generation gap affected virtually every part of the world . No country , not even China and Russia , was immune , Antipathies heightened and tensions sharpened , until a near life-and-death struggle developed between the old and the young . In Red China , the youth turned in almost total rebellion against the older generation . The same was true in many parts of Europe . While the impact in America has been less than in some parts of the world , it is greater than in others . It became the straights versus the swingers , the moral versus the permissive , drawn along chronological lines . With short fuses and low boiling points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provocation , be expected to split into two irritable and often angry camps , with the smallest of issues taking on enough significance to trigger an argument , a fight , or even a revolution . So characteristic of our times is the generation gap that Erich Segal built it into the plot of Love Story . This work topped the fiction bestseller list week after week . Charles Reich 's The Greening of America , which during those same weeks topped the nonfiction list , deals with the issues which this gap raises . Nor , as I have already mentioned , is the gap an American phenomenon . It peaked enough in China to magnetize twenty-five million Red Guards into a youth march of unprecedented proportions . In Soviet Russia an indication of its power is the way it elicits from the pen of young poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko the widely disseminated lines : I wish to quarrel in a big way , My own strength intoxicates me . I drive on , plain-speaking , irreconcilable , And that means  --  I am young ! " Send your son to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Felix Houphouet-Boigny , President of the Ivory Coast . " Send him to the Sorbonne in Paris and he will return a Communist . " The generation gap is clearly as universal as it is deeply entrenched . What nettles many young people is the persistent refusal of their el-ders to bend to the winds of change , winds which at times they them-selves have blown up . This makes the youth feel that they are unique -- a special electric body who stand apart Continued on page 104 continued from page 47 from any race of people who have ever inhabited this planet . This claim to uniqueness has been flung into the teeth of parents and school administrators around the world . " if you do n't understand , get out of the way , " has become more of a threat than a plea . The young are right , at least partially , when they indict the older generation : " It 's you adults who push drugs on us , who print and sell pornography to seize our dimes and dollars , and your constant barrage of ads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without . You open charge accounts for us to buy a lot of junk we do n't need . " John Leo , writing in the Christian Herald , points to the youth counterculture having been " born of patience , mobility , and prolonged adolescence . A society that keeps its young out of approved adult roles until the age of twenty-one or twenty-two , produces children at a rate that makes them half the population , and then supplies them with enough money to create and respond to their own economic markets , is doing nothing less than spawning a new culture . Stripped of technical jargon , what the social scientists have been telling us is that young people , formerly oriented toward family and tradition , are now oriented toward one another . " Causes of the generation rift could be summed up , in addition to the foregoing : the natural rebellion of the human heart ; the emptiness evident everywhere ; the constant erosion and dehumanization of personality by a machine-oriented age ; the lack of purpose and meaning ; the tragic failure of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young and consequently anger their parents ; the overriding social problems that have no foreseeable solutions ; the failure of parents to live what they preach ; the failure of government to understand that the basic gut-level problems facing the nation are not materialistic and social , but moral and spiritual . The church , too , is at fault in turning from Biblical proclamation to social and political activism . Too many clergymen are just plain phonies in the eyes of the youth . They want to see discipleship in the lives of their parents and they want the clergy to " tell it like it is " from the pulpit . How long will it take to learn that God meant it when He warned that " The nation which will not serve me shall perish " ? How long will it take to learn that astronomical congressional appropriations are no substitute for spiritual awakening which , in the final analysis , alone can reform our institutions and the individuals who make up society ? In searching for ways to bridge the generation gap , there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haveto practice what we preach by striving more and more to bring our conduct into line with our code of beliefs . No mother can demand that her daughter abstain from sleeping around when she herself is flirting and on occasion compromising her own moral conduct . No father who wavers between heavy social drinking and occasional binges to the edge of alcoholism , and who ca n't speak a pleasant word in the morning until he has had a cigarette , can yell incessantly at his son to get off marijuana , the route that often leads to hard drugs . Consistency , constancy , and undeviating diligence to maintain Christian character are a must if the older generation is to command respect or expect to get even a hearing from the young . Another point for parents : There are times when our lives are straight as a gun barrel , but instead of letting our children be placed in the hands of God by prayer , to be developed by Him into their unique potential , we try to force them into a mold . " Be not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to be , since you can not make yourself as you wish to be . " ( Thomas a Kempis ) The younger generation does n't want to be a rubber stamp of its elders . " A chip off the old block " is a phrase which would not appear in a youth dictionary . In the past we have required our young to defer significant feats both great and small , to be content withcontests for grades and athletic letters , and to keep their heads buried in their books . So the average student , full-grown and exploding with energy , remains a dependent whose actions are monitored and whose life is carefully protected by his elders . As the years pass he grows increasingly restive , knowing himself to be an adult with a large stock of relevant knowledge , though with less experience than his parents , but often treated like a child . Today his universal rejection of this role is being exploited by the radicals who have founded " the movement . " It is international in scope , and it is passionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coin . Many times young people reject their parents for no reason at all . Many parents have done a good job rearing their children . Showering their children with love , they have spent hours every week with them . They have prayed earnestly for them and sacrificed much for them . Then when their children reach a certain age , they reject their parents . As Erich Segal put it : " I would define a father as a person who will someday be misunderstood by his son . " One of life 's most painful experiences is for a parent to be rejected by his child . This is happening more and more in our society . Often it is not the parent 's fault  --  it is the child 's fault . There is a certain indefinable age in the early teens at which God treats a child as an adult , Then he must make his own moral decisions . Post : Do you think he can ? Billy : I do n't know .

Jesus Christ Superstar I think borders on blasphemy and the sacrilegious , but at the same time it 's asking the right questions . It 's asking the question that millions of young people are confronted with . It gives a marvelous opportunity for people like me to come back with an authoritative answer and say that Jesus Christ is the Son of the Living God and that He rose from the dead . They leave Him in the grave . I can say that He rose again , that He 's alive , that He 's coming back to set the world straight someday . From that point of view Jesus Christ Superstar clarifies what we may think , and that too is to the good . It 's all quite a fad . Sidney Poitier portrays a black Christ in Alabama in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Billboard and Variety both have predicted that the songs of the seventies , instead of being on drugs and sex among young people , will be on religion and religious themes . I was in Germany last week and the big magazine there , Stern , had an article on the Jesus movement in Berlin . I was in Amsterdam about two months ago and there were just hundreds of these so-called Jesus young people among the hippies who had invaded Amsterdam . It is becoming a world phenomenon even in such places as Romania . I have a feeling , I may be wrong and I really do n't have any statistics to support this , but I have a feeling that we have reached a peak in the drug situation . Education is beginning to pay off . And even the news . .. such as this morning , where we read that this young fellow in a church shot and killed the janitor and tore the church up and wounded two or three others and then killed himself . I think these young people are beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's more lasting than the highs you get from drugs . I do think that there is a turning point coming on , and that we shall see the results soon . Post : Is it fair to ask you your opinions on birth control and abortion ? Do you want this off the record ? Billy : Thank you , no . Anything I say is all right for quotation . I am a strong advocate of birth control . I know this runs contrary to some Catholic doctrine but I suspect that many Catholics practice it . When you travel through India , Pakistan , etc. , you have to believe in some sort of control of the population . I do n't think it should ever be a state control . I do n't think we should ever set a limit on families and say that no family can have more than two or three children . 1 think that it has to be voluntary . But the population explosion is a very serious thing . Evidently between 1975 and 1980 there are some parts of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have learned to grow in the Philippines and other places does n't have the nutritional value that we thought it was going to have . The new wheat is also falling short as is the so-called miracle rice . Forester , who is probably the world 's greatest computer expert , fed into his computer three months ago data regarding the population explosion , the ecological problem , the new weapons systems , the crime situation and everything . The answer was , according to the machine , that the world has less than a generation to survive . I would think that unless we get the ecological problem solved , unless we do something about the population explosion , the human race is in trouble . I 'm not in favor of abortion , except where there is rape , incest , or where the mother 's life is in jeopardy . Post : A number of people have suggested that you would make a good President of the United States . Would you care to comment ? Billy : laughs . Well , first of all , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me preach would immediately say , " what is he doing in politics ? " The public reaction would be negative . In the second place I would not have the qualifications . I do n't think I would have the physical or nervous stamina to be President . Thirdly , 1 do n't have the intellectual ability to cope with the problems that we have . I 've been fairly close to two or three Presidents , so I know something of what they feel , and it 's just really beyond a man to deal with . I think Mr. Nixon is coming as close to it as anybody . Contrary to what people think about him , he is a true intellectual . We have n't had an intellectual in the White House in a long time . Kennedy was no intellectual  --  I mean he was written up by the Eastern press as an intellectual because he agreed with the Eastern Establishment . But Nixon is a true intellectual and he is a student , particularly a student of history . In that respect he 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , God has called me to preach , and I would never deter from that because my lips would turn to clay if I ever left what God has called me to do for something else . I 've had three Presidents offer me jobs , top positions , and I have said no to all of them  --  I do n't know how many President Johnson has asked me to serve in . I said no to all of them , and the reason President Nixon has n't asked me to serve on any of those things since he became President is simply because he knows my position . I 've made it quite clear to him . I do a lot of little things to try to maybe help a President , primarily in the spiritual and moral area , but I feel that my role is of a preacher , a spiritual influence on whatever President is there , whether he is a Democrat or a Republican . In my own home town I have accepted an invitation to serve a hospital authority , but other than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some of those commissions and give them my point of view but I feel that such is my role . I do n't think there 's any conceivable circumstance that I would ever change because my calling to God 's work was so clear and unmistakable  --  and still is to this day  --  that I do n't think I would do anything else . I can make a greater contribution the way 1 am , because the moment you enter politics you have divided everything . And at the moment , I can go out and preach to labor leaders , business leaders , Catholics , Protestants , Jews , and they all accept me as a preacher of the Gospel and I feel that this is my calling . Post : May we refer to your article in the Reader 's Digest , " Through the Valley of the Shadow , " and your comments about older people who bravely admitted to a fear of death ? Then later on you cited one man who had achieved a great deal of serenity and peace by getting his affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what you say to the person who is afraid to die and is doubtful how to face it  --  which is all of us ? Billy : Well , I 've faced that experience a lot of times . I met a man in Vietnam who said , " I have been through a seminary , I 'm a chaplain here , and I had a man the other day die . I had to talk to him in his dying moments and he asked me how he could be sure he was saved , that he was going to heaven , and 1 did n't know what to tell him . " And he asked me , " What would you tell him ? " I think many clergymen do n't know what to say at such an hour as that . I personally have found that when people are dying , they do n't want you to cover up , they do n't want you to beat around the bush , they do n't want you to come in and make out that everything is fine . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to talk about death , they want you to talk about the future life . They want to hear with some authority whether you believe there is a future life or not , and why you believe it . I have gone over in much detail how a man can know that he 's saved and going to heaven . I have said first of all that God loves you . No matter what you 've done in the past , God loves you . You have sinned against God , you have broken His law and the result of that sin is death . But God sent Jesus Christ to die on the cross for you and that is why we are saved . We 're not saved because we 're good . We 're not saved because we have lived a good life . I 'm not going to heaven because I have preached a lot , or read the Bible or prayed . I 'm going to heaven totally and completely on the merits of what Christ did on that cross . The Bible says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are saved by Grace . And that word Grace is something I did n't deserve . Most people are thinking at the end , " I wonder if I am good enough . " You do n't have to be good enough . It has to all end on Jesus Christ and what He did . This is what Good Friday is all about . This is what the cross is all about , and that 's why every Catholic church and every Protestant church has a cross . The cross is a symbol of Christianity because something supernatural happened on it . Christ took judgment ; He died and that 's how I know that I 'm going to heaven . As a result of this , I have perfect faith about our relationship with God . I have perfect peace about my future . Of course , I have the natural tensions and fears of self-preservation , because if we did n't have them we might walk in front of a truck or something else . So that when a plane gets in a thunderstorm , 1 grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not because I 'm afraid . Many times I look forward to death . I have no fear of death whatsoever . I think that one of the bravest and most courageous men that I know right now is dying in only a matter of hours , and he 's just facing death with a smile , courage , joy , and serenity because of his faith in God . He is one of the richest men in the world , but his faith is all that counts now . Post : What man in history do you most admire ? Or rather , shall we say , whom would you place second , since Christ is a historical figure ? Billy : without hesitation . Well , of course it would be a Biblical person . long pause . t would say Da niel because he was prime minister of the greatest empire in the world . I would n't say the Roman Empire was the world 's greatest empire , the Assyrian Empire was . Daniel was a combination of prophet and political leader and he wrote about many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Post : What about prayer in t he schools ? Billy : After reading all this stuff in the Congressional Record and all the arguments used against the prayer , I would say that every teacher in America has the right to stand up and read the Bible in front of the class . What has happened is the school boards and principals throughout the country have misinterpreted congressional intent . It would be good to have another poll because the American people , in my opinion by 92 percent , want prayer in the school . Post : You must be greatly in demand for personal appearances beyond your crusades . Billy : Yes , last year I had 8,000 invitations to speak . I was offered every type of inducement , including $10,000 for one speech . Of course , I take no income at all for any speech , or any article I write . The fee I tell them to give to their favorite charity or to send it to our Association , and we use it for evangelism . I do have an inheritance from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for our needs . My father was Just a poor farmer with a third grade education , but the best part of our home town moved out on the property . We have banks , shopping centers , all kinds of things up there , managed by my brother . I have two sisters and a brother . My sister married a clergyman and he 's one of the best-known clergy men in America  --  Layton Ford , even though he 's a Canadian . Post : What about your children  --  do they show any interest at all in following in your footsteps ? Billy : Well , my three daughters are all Bible teachers . They have classes in their homes . One is married to a Swiss investment banker , who is studying now to be a doctor . The second daughter married a New York dentist . The third one married an advertising executive in Philadelphia , and they live in Valley Forge . All the girls married devout Christians . My oldest son does n't know yet what he wants to be . My youngest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although at the moment he leans toward being a tennis professional . Ruth has had the responsibility of rearing and teaching these children . She stayed at home hundreds of times , when I suppose she might have liked to travel with me , but one of us has been at home all the time with the children and it 's paid off . We are very happy with our children since , as you know , a lot of clergymen 's children have deep problems and many of them , you know , just go off the deep end . But I think that part of our success has been because of the place we live , We could have lived in New York , probably had more contacts , more excitement , and all the rest of the big city , but we lived here in the mountains and reared them like mountain children . We kept open house so all their friends could come here . Also , we live in a college community and we have a lot of college students coming up here . Post : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you have to get down that road in a hurry ? Billy : We have a jeep . But once we came to the point where even the jeep would n't make it and we had to use sleds . The nineteenth of November two years ago we had eleven inches of snow . Actually , if we had to we could land a helicopter on that bit of lawn beside the house . Would you like to see it ? Sargent Shriver landed there in a helicopter one time , and at another time one of t hose big military helicopters , searching for someone who was lost in the mountains , came down just as neatly . The Grahams usher us out into the magnificent sunlit vista of their mountainside retreat . We are all silent for a few moments looking out across the valley to the distant peaks of the Black Mountains . The terrace is a kind of platform midway between heaven and earth , and there is a sense of soaring out into space as we stand there . The mountainside plunges down steeply below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a really handsomely built little tree-house ? wedged in the crotch of an enormous pine which towers up far above it ? where Nelson Graham enjoys taking leave of the earthbound cares of boyhood . We are reluctant to leave the terrace , all the more because our host brings out a couple of rocking chairs given to him by President Lyndon B. Johnson  --  and these are rocking chairs , beautifully simple , handmade creations which prove that comfort and functional design have been longtime coordinates in the Deep-South country . We leave reluctantly , with the Grahams graciously seeing us off in the courtyard , where the big bell from a monster locomotive of the Southern Railroad stands guard in silent dignity . We head towards the Billy Graham offices and library at the very bottom of the mountain where the evangelist works with his staff , meets official visitors , and conducts the business of his monumental schedule . A charming episode suddenly materializes as we attempt to reach the Graham offices ( the building was formerly a comfortable country retreat for an artist ) and are sidetracked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some extensive building additions which are being made to the office structure . A young woman of striking appearance leaves her small children and romping dogs , and graciously directs us how to weave our way through the alterations and heavy machinery to the right door ? we have really disturbed her at her own private home . It is not until an hour or so later , as we examine the family photographic archives in the Graham offices that we realize that this young lady is Mrs. Tchividjian , the Graham 's daughter " Gigi " ( Virginia ) , and that the youngsters are their grandchildren . We are struck not only by the fact that she so simply and warmly directed us without revealing who she was , but also by the fact that this family branch has obviously settled just about as close to the father and mother as possible . Something very happy is in the air . Inside the office , we encounter more of the myriads of Billy Graham books , and as we sense the bustle and pressures of the place , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has achieved the monument of his faith amidst the complexities of world liturgies and the endless demands of his modern environment  --  something close to a miracle of self-discipline and self-realization . And the end product is made clear as we leave Montreat : it has been a busy , full morning , and yet we are completely serene . The presence of Billy Graham contains a gift of himself to others .
