The Federal Government sometimes uses its tax dollars to underwrite academic research that might charitably be described as frivolous . Among recipients of such largesse is Sociologist Pierre van den Berghe of the University of Washington , who used part of a $97,000 grant from the National Institute of Mental Health to underwrite a report by his researcher , George Primov , titled , " The Peruvian Brothel as Sexual Dispensary and Social Arena . " <P> Primov made some 20 visits to the San Tutis brothel outside the Andean city of Cuzco . His interviews with the prostitutes led to the conclusion that brothels do serve as , among other things , a gathering place for drinking and storytelling . <P> Senator William Proxmire last week gave the study his Golden Fleece Award for " the biggest , most ridiculous or most ironic waste of taxpayers ' money . " Van den Berghe , the author of Academic Gamesmanship , professed to be pleased , saying : " My reputation in the academic community will be enhanced . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
