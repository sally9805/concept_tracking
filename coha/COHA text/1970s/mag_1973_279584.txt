McNALLY and <P> RADU FLORESCU 223 pages . New York Graphic . $8.95 . <P> <P> California is , of course , the new Transylvania . The mind does not boggle therefore at the news that a professor at California State University at San Francisco teaches an accredited course in vampirism . He also has written a book . A question arises . Is Professor Wolf for vampirism or against it ? The answer remains murky . For what the professor has done is to invent a scholarly equivalent of the celebrated New Journalism , whose practitioners take their own temperatures every second paragraph and print the resultant fever charts as reportage . <P> " I shiver with more than cold , " one of his early sentences begins , " and into my trained academic mind there push , in all their luminosity , Faust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes on to quote do not , as it happens , come within half a mile of the subject of vampires . Professor Wolf , as he explains , was sitting one sunny day on the Berkeley campus watching girls and feeling randy when he happened to think of Faust . And so ? So nothing ; Wolfs trained academic mind drops the thought , satisfied that it has served its purpose as a lyrical prelude . <P> The thought he then takes up is arresting : " We slept , in the dark , sweet exhaustion after love , for hours in near oblivion . " What 's this ? Read on : " It was no time for the telephone bell , but it rang . And rang . As if a fishhook had caught in the back of my skull and I was reeled upward from the nourishing dark , and at last I heard it , reached for it , angrily .

The reader is treated to Hamlet 's " To be or not to be " soliloquy ( twice ) and to an account of Wolfs first sex experience . Wolf donates a pint of blood to a hospital and allows himself to entertain giddy thoughts . He interviews some cancer patients , who have little to say , and an actor , Christopher Lee , who has played Dracula in several films . He talks with some high school girls , and although the subject of vampires does not come up , he learns a lot about teen-age sex . He does find one 22-year-old sadomasochist who says he likes to suck blood .
