IT had long been obvious that the construction industry could not continue in 1973 the blistering pace of last year , when it started a record 2.4 million dwelling units , but economists and builders originally expected only a mild and healthy decline that would halt incipient overbuilding . Now , however , the National Association of Home Builders fears that starts will fall 20% , to around 1.9 million , the lowest since the recession year of 1970 . That would be about twice as sharp a drop as first anticipated , and enough to put a painful crimp in builders ' profits and hardhat payrolls . <P> The outlook has been darkened by President Nixon 's decision to halt new federal money for subsidy programs that last year financed the construction of 14% of all housing starts . Three key programs are involved : <P> 1 ) The Public Housing program , under which the Government pays to local housing authorities about two-thirds of the rent charged low-income tenants in projects designed for them . <P> 2 ) Section 235 of the Housing Act of 1968 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average annual incomes of about $7,000 to buy houses . Such families can get FHA-insured mortgage loans of as much as $24,000 , and pay as little as 1 % interest on them ; the FHA pays the rest . <P> 3 ) Section 236 of the Housing Act , under which the Government pays most of the interest on mortgage loans to banks and other lenders for apartment houses for poor families . That enables the authorities operating these buildings to charge much lower rents than they would have to if they paid all the interest themselves . <P> The President ordered that no new projects be approved under any subsidy programs for as long as 18 months , while federal officials re-evaluate the programs ' effectiveness . But the order specified that projects already approved by Jan. 5 could go ahead , and it was originally thought that enough work was under way to keep builders busy all year . Indeed , George Romney , who was Secretary of Housing and Urban Development when the freeze began , insisted that at least a quarter of a million subsidized units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1972 . <P> Now , though , it has become obvious that the freeze will not only prevent much new building , but will stop many slum-rebuilding projects in midcourse , halting site-clearance work or even actual construction already in progress . Housing officials in some cities move such projects along on the basis of verbal commitments from federal officials . They sign a formal subsidy contract only when the builders are about to begin putting up steel and pouring concrete , or have already begun . <P> According to New York City 's housing chief Andrew Kerr , the city , acting on Government promises of aid , had begun construction of 6,000 units . But because no written agreement had been signed , no federal funds will now be available , and the future of the housing is uncertain . " The Government left us holding the bag , " Kerr asserts . The Chicago Housing Authority had applications pending with the Government for 8,500 units ; now all work from planning to demolition has stopped . Plans for public-housing projects also have been interrupted in Milwaukee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event that local officials can find money to replace federal financing .
