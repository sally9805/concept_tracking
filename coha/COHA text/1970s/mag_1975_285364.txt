" We are now moving toward an understanding with the Soviet Union that should significantly diminish the obstacles to emigration and ease the hardship of prospective emigrants . " <P> - Henry Kissinger <P> <P> After the U.S. Secretary of State made public his " understanding " with the Kremlin last September , hopes soared among Soviet Jews that harassment of would-be migrs to Israel might come to a halt . Soviet denial of the existence of that understanding last month dampened those hopes-and rightly so . Despite passage by the U.S. Congress of a trade bill that gives the Soviet Union most-favored-nation status*-a bill that was contingent upon Moscow 's easing of emigration restrictions-there has been a marked upsurge within the U.S.S.R. of harassment of Russian Jews . Kissinger predicted earlier that congressional pressure on the emigration issue would prove to be counterproductive . <P> Arrests of prospective Jewish migrs , as well as a sensational show trial in the Ukraine , indicate that there has been a change in the relatively conciliatory policy that had allowed 54,000 Jews to leave the country in the past two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 34,000 during the previous year ; last month only 900 Russian emigrants arrived in Israel-the lowest total for any month in four years . Since non-Jewish Soviet citizens are not allowed to emigrate freely either , Moscow 's attitude toward Jews who want to leave is consistent , if hardly pleasant . <P> Whisked Away . Since Congress passed the trade bill , at least seven Leningrad Jewish activists have been picked up by the police in connection with a planned hunger strike protesting emigration barriers . Four refuseniks ( Soviet Jews whose applications to go to Israel have been turned down ) , Georgi Sokiryansky , Iosif Blikh , Israel Varnovitsky and Vladimir Sverdlin , were arrested while on their way to Moscow for the strike . Physicist Lev Zhigun , a prominent Zionist and refusenik , was poisoned in a Leningrad caf . An ambulance whisked him away to a hospital , where he was held incommunicado for ten days . Last week the Soviet Supreme Court denied the appeal of Mikhail Levyev , the former manager of a Moscow store who was sentenced to death last month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him until Levyev prepared to emigrate to Israel . <P> Another case of recent repression involves Mikhail Shtern , 56 , an eminent Jewish endocrinologist , who was sentenced on New Year 's Eve to eight years at hard labor on trumped-up charges . During his pretrial interrogation , Shtern was told by a prosecutor that " the accusation is connected with your desire to emigrate , because the emigration of Jews discredits our country . " At his trial in the Ukrainian city of Vinnitsa , the doctor was accused of taking bribes from his patients , involving 775 rubles ( $1,050 ) , one chicken , two geese , three baskets of apples and 70 eggs . Actually , these were either repayments for hard-to-get medicines personally purchased by Shtern or small gifts from grateful patients . More than 3,000 Western physicians have protested the trial , and an international campaign is mounting to free him and 34 other victims of the anti-emigration drive , who are called " Prisoners for Zion .
