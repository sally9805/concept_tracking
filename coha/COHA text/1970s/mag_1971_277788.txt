If someone is going to put a wet diaper in your hand , pick Sandy Dennis to do it . The girl makes it seem like some sort of unpublicized honor . A delectable scatterbrain , she appears to be permanently stalled somewhere between bed and breakfast . Sandy is one of life 's winning losers . Her eyes imply that the tear ducts were installed first , and her voice box quivers with a heart broken in transit . Perhaps she is every father 's illusion of a vulnerable daughter . Count her a big funny plus in a small funny British comedy import called How the Other Half Loves . <P> Ditto : Phil Silvers . If someone is going to do an in-place jog in your living room in a blue sweatsuit , and rig the timer so that he wo n't collapse in the middling prime of his life , then why not share the pleasure of Phil 's strenuously hilarious company ? What with his toothy grin and Dennis ' prehensile incisors , the pair might be auditioning for a dentists ' convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage , adultery . To define it further , it is also about that common sequel to adultery-how to keep the spouse from finding out . Silvers is the cuckold . His wife ( Bernice Massi ) has spent part of the night with a prized employee of his . Among sexual detectives , Silvers rates on a par with Dr. Watson . Only the final curtain brings light to his cloudily creased forehead . <P> This is not a comedy that will incur the enthusiasm of devotees of Aristophanes , Molire , or even Neil Simon . To laugh at How the Other Half Loves is a little like making a midnight raid on the refrigerator , half ashamed but sneakingly satisfied .
