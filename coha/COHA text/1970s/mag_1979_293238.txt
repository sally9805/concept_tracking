COLLECTED STORIES : 1939-1976 by Paul Bowles Black Sparrow ; 417pages ; $14 hardcover , $6 paper <P> Paul Bowles is a Renaissance man born into an age that applauds specialization . Doing several things very well indeed has , paradoxically , brought him less public acclaim than he might have received had he stuck to one . Bowles , 68 , has been a distinguished composer ; in 1947 Musician Virgil Thomson called him " America 's most original and skillful composer of chamber music . " He has written music for the stage , particularly for the plays of his friend Tennessee Williams . He has also been a tireless collector of folklore and legends , especially from Morocco , where he has lived on and off since the early 1930s . There he and his wife , the late novelist Jane Bowles , presided over a lively colony of literary migrs and pilgrims . Bowles translated Sartre and founded Antaeus , a superb quarterly ; his publications include novels ( The Sheltering Sky . Let It Come Down ) , collections of poetry and short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North African Moghrebi dialect and an autobiography . His work has been highly esteemed by other writers , including a few ( Norman Mailer , Gore Vidal ) with no love for each other . Yet Bowles remains less familiar to general readers than dozens of his inferiors . <P> Collected Stories : 1939-1976 provides a chance to isolate and trace one strand of Bowles ' remarkable career . The book 's 39 tales are not only worth reading on their own , but their assembly should dispel several myths that have grown up around Bowles ' work . First , spreading his talent wide has not meant that he spread it thin ; any short list of the best contemporary American stories should include two or three from this volume . Second , Bowles ' reputation as a pitiless chronicler of the bizarre and sadistic is undeserved ; many of his stories are unquestionably grotesque , but the impact of this collection is much more complex and humane . <P> The essential Bowles plot charts a clash between two cultures , one usually Western and the other primitive . Primitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings in North Africa , near the deadly lure of the Sahara , or in stifling , vegetation-choked places in Mexico or South America . Visitors come to feast on the picturesque and take one step too many off the beaten path . From that point on , they are more truly on their own than they ever dreamed possible . Sometimes their fate is terrible . In A Distant Episode , a linguistics professor studying North African dialects stumbles foolishly into the hands of a gang of marauding nomads ; they cut out his tongue and then teach him clownish tricks to perform at their revels . Other interlopers get gentler treatment . In Pastor Dowe at Tacat , an ineffectual missionary is driven away from an Indian village by an act of generosity ; local custom obliges him to accept a villager 's seven-year-old daughter as his wife .
