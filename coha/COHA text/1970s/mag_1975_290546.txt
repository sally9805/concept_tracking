OUTLOOK / TIME BOARD OF ECONOMISTS <P> As business moves into its traditionally bustling fall season , signs of a quickening recovery from the nation 's most severe postwar recession are multiplying . Employment , store sales , industrial production and corporate profits have all turned up ; the leading indicators - those statistics that tend to foreshadow future economic trends-have shown an exceptionally strong rise in the past five months ( see chart ) . Yet the figures are breeding no euphoria ; instead , many bankers , businessmen and economists see danger signals ahead . Their big worry is that a combination of resurging inflation , tight money , climbing interest rates , and inadequate Government stimulus to the economy will choke off the recovery , possibly as early as the middle of next year , before it has done much to bring down the nation 's high unemployment rate , and perhaps even tip the economy into a new slump by 1977 . <P> Tax Cuts . Those fears were analyzed last week by members of the TIME Board of Economists , who gathered in Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next year or so . It was a spirited session marked by unusually sharp arguments between conservatives and liberals , and even some quarrels on specific points between ideological allies . Republicans Murray Weidenbaum and Beryl Sprinkel insisted that the recovery could keep going through 1976 and beyond with no more stimulus than the Ford Administration now plans , which will probably include acceptance of an extension of this year 's temporary tax cuts . They believe any effort to force-feed greater growth could be severely inflationary . All six of their colleagues present at the meeting voiced deep worry that unless Washington shifts soon to more expansionary monetary or fiscal ( tax and spending ) policies , the upturn will begin to fizzle out around the middle of next year . <P> Most of TIME 's economists expect real gross national product-the output of goods and services discounted for inflation-to sprint up at an annual rate of about 7% for the rest of this year and through the first half of 1976 . Prices in that time will probably rise at a 7% to 8% annual rate , a disturbingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered in 1973-74 , but much better than the 15.4% compound annual rate of inflation the U.S. suffered in July . Unemployment , which fell from 9.2% in May to 8.4% in both July and August , will come down , but painfully slowly . It may well still be above 8% by year 's end , and will decline only to 7.5% or a trifle less by late 1976 . These forecasts , which are roughly in line with predictions voiced to a congressional task force last week by President Ford 's chief economic adviser , Alan Greenspan , underscore an important point : the recession dragged the U.S. economy so far down that several years of unusually strong growth , not just one , will be needed to return the nation to full prosperity .
