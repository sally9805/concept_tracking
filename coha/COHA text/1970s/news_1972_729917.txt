txt Representatives of the Book Co. and Time-Life , Inc. , today disclosed in court here that a total of $750,000 has been paid thru Swiss banks in connection with the alleged autobiography of billionaire recluse Howard Hughes . During the court session , Hughes ' attorneys stated that none of the money had gone to Hughes , that Hughes does not have an account at a Swiss bank , and for the first time they said publicly : " There is a culprit in this case who has duped the publishers and we have yet to find him . " Injunction Is Sought These remarks and others were made before New York Supreme Court Judge Gerald P. Culki n . Hughes ' lawyers were acting for Rosemont Publications of Las Vegas , Nev. , a wholly owned Hughes subsidiary . They were seeking an injunction to prevent , Time-Life , Dell Books , and others from publishing what the firms had described as an authorized autobiography of Hughes . attorney Halliburton Fates II insisted that the manuscript was authentic , that Hughes ' signatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosemont was a " paper entity created to supress publication of information about Hughes . " Fates also told Culkin that the New York courts already had ruled in earlier hearings that an injunction against publication of an autobiography or biography violated the First Amendment . He said that consequently Rosemont and the Hughes group in general were without legal redress in this case . Hughes ' OK Is Key . " Nobody is interested in a Hughes biography , " interjected Culkin . " What interests everyone is this ' auto ' business  --  the mark of personal approval of Hughes . " This is the gist of the whole business as I see it . Anyone can publish a biography but if you want the label autobiography , that 's a horse of another color . " Maybe we all ought to go down to the Bahamas together and settle this whole thing right there , " Culkin continued with a straight face . " I 'm sure this would be cheaper and quicker in the long run . " When the Rosemont application was filed before Culkin a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clifford Irving , who wrote the alleged Hughes story , to bring into court the " authenticating material " which they said they possessed . Publishers Comply The various members of the publishing group complied with this  --  order by handing affidavits and : photostatic copies to the Hughes lawyers in the courtroom today . As a result , both David Shivitz for Rosemont , and Chester Davis , appearing directly . for Hughes , ammended their pleas for a temporary injunction to include a request for an immediate priority from the judge to call Irving and officers of the publishing companies for immediate examinations in deposition hearings and discovery examinations . " and Irvin g , , .. tave just turned over to us for the very first time a vast amount of material which they claim proves that their manuscript is authentic , and the only way we can attack this material , which we submit is not authentic , is by cross-examination of the principals in this affair , " Shivitz said . " Can Prove Hoax " " If we are granted priority for our discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executives of the publishing firms that they have been had ; I mean that someone has pulled a fast one , " he continued . " Now that they have made the material available we will -7 : be able to prove to their satisfaction and to the court 's that , : this is a hoax , " he said . Shivitz said that they learned front material just handed to them in the courtroom that the first Life magazine extracts Will go to press on Feb. 2 , and that the Book-of-the-Month Club . yould go to print Jan. 27 , and this narrows down the time limit in the inquiry . Learns About Cheeks Davis told Culkin : " Mr. Ir-. ying , who had refused until now ' any cooperation with us , has - just given in his affidavit dates land places he met someone he said was Mr. Hughes . I will need only a day or two to pro : duce live witnesses not in the 7 : ' employ of Mr. Hughes and not interested in anything but the truth , who will refute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning for the first time about the several checks and funds passed in this case ? and the not inconsiderable sum of $750,000 is involved , " Davis said . " I remind the court of two aspects of the case : one , that Hughes has said publicly that he did not receive the money and that Mr. Irving never talked to him . " Whoever signed the notes , contracts , agreements , a n d other papers Mr. Irving had produced , and whoever signed Hughes ' name to these checks is not known . I still have to find this culprit and to do so I certainly do need to conduct an oral examination of Mr. Irving . " A spokesman for Time-Life Inc. , said that Time had agreed to pay $250,000 for three extracts of the Irving manuscript and already had paid out more than $100,000 to . The spokesman emphasized that Time had no dealings with either Irving or Hughes . Blast at Rosemont The ' Time spokesman also called Rosemont an " instrument of supression " for information about Hughes . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more severely than Rosemont in the dispute . He said that a national magazine is not put together overnight and that in order to recoun some of the outlays of the Hughes affair Time-Life has signed contracts with 25 foreign nublications . He said that copies of extracts from Irving 's book must be transmitted to the foreign buyers within the next few days so they can be translated into 20 different languages . At this point Culk in announced that he would take the petition under advisement and issue a ruling as soon as possible . Court attaches said that in a matter of . this importance , the judge 's findings probably would be prepared within 48 hours . Response by Attorney After Culkin ' left the bench , Davis rushed ' over to Fales and said to him , 9f I took you down to the Bahamas now and you saw Hughes , would you believe you bought a hoax ? " " Just you make your appearances here in this court Mr. Davis and explain to us why Mr. Hughes himself did n't have an affidavit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newsmen the Irving affidavit in response to Culkin 's earlier order , a sheaf of more than 25 pages of legal foolscap . Davis said : " I barely had time to glance over it right here in the courtroom , but for the first time we know where Irving says he met Hughes and I can give you a few examples . " Reason for No Affidavit Davis then quickly read off the following alleged meeting places , all in 1971 : March 4-5 , San Juan , Puerto Rico ; Feb. 15 , Tehuantepec , Mexico ; Sept. 11 , Paradise Isle , Nassau ; Sept. 23-24 , Key Biscayne , Fla. ; Sept. 25 , Miami Beach ; and Feb. 13 , Oxaca , Mexico . Davis said there were a number of other places but these would serve as an example . " In his telephone interview , Hughes publicly said that he had not been away from the Bahamas since Thanksgiving of 1970 , altho of course , he has been outside his hotel there , " Davis stated . " We have not filed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no notary public in the . Bahamas who knows Mr. Hughes and could attest his signature , " Davis said .
