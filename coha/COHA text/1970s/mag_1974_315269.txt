THE THEATER <P> JUMPERS by TOM STOPPARD <P> Seven years ago , in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead , British Playwright Tom Stoppard turned Hamlet inside out and seemed to prove that even for bit players , great tragedy has no silver lining . When critics inquired about the play 's message , Stoppard averred that this is no age for message in the theater . " One writes about human beings under stress , " he said , " whether it is about losing one 's trousers or being nailed to a cross . " To risk a play whose primary level was philosophical , he added , " would be fatal . " In Jumpers , that is just the gamble he has taken-in London with triumphant results . Now the play has opened in Washington , D.C. , for a limited run at the John F. Kennedy Center . <P> Moral Absolutes . Jumpers begins at a surreal party . A girl swings back and forth over the stage as she performs a denture-defying striptease . Some lemon-clad gymnasts , called Jumpers , do flips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his pyramid .

But the playwright also offers a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Moore . Moore is a professor of moral philosophy . In his office opposite Dotty 's bedroom , he is busy dictating a discourse in defense of moral absolutes - in fact , of the whole idea of goodness and even the possibility of God 's existence . " Is God ? " he begins . But soon he is revising : " Are God ? " Before long , Moore has fumblingly re-created the whole history of man 's proofs of God 's existence , the decline of faith and philosophy 's search for knowledge , from the ancient wrestlers with the nature of truth and virtue down to the pusillanimous modern school , which limits itself to discussing the slipperiness of words .
