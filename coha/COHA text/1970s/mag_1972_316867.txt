Through these doors pass the future automotive painters of the world . - Sign over a Los Angeles garage <P> THE words may not seem wildly ambitious , but to the ghetto blacks being trained inside the garage with money from the Labor Department , the sign symbolizes the hope of acquiring a marketable skill . In the past ten years , the Government has spent $19 billion to nurture that hope through job-training programs that at one time or another have enrolled more than 8,000,000 people . This fiscal year , Washington will pay $1.6 billion to companies , vocational schools and public and private agencies that contract to teach job skills to more than 1,000,000 of the unemployed and underemployed-and sometimes to instruct them in the three Rs and personal grooming . <P> The payments are being made with growing reluctance . In the view of many businessmen , and more important of high Nixon Administration officials , the programs have swallowed huge amounts of taxpayers ' money but failed to put enough unemployed into productive jobs . The programs are thus prime targets for budget cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring , charged that the " array of patchwork programs ... is not delivering the jobs , the training and the other manpower services that this nation needs . " Such opinions will be reinforced by the recent drop in unemployment , which may make training seem less urgent . The Government reported last week that the jobless rate in November fell to 5.2% , the lowest figure since August 1970 . <P> Is manpower training a boondoggle or a boon to those who are still unemployed ? The Government 's total effort is a complex of programs too diverse to support any generalization , except that manpower training has grown into a bureaucratic monstrosity . There are separate programs-many bearing such optimistic names as Apprenticeship Outreach , Operation Mainstream , JOBS , JUMP and WIN-for the urban poor and the rural poor ; for blacks , Chicanos , Puerto Ricans and Appalachian whites ; for Viet Nam veterans , displaced aircraft engineers and welfare mothers . <P> Some programs offer classroom instruction , others on-the-job training , still others a mixture of both . They aim to place graduates in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoe repairman , nurse 's aide , hotel bookkeeper . Coordination and supervision are spotty at best . Houston-area officials of the Labor Department 's Manpower Administration do not even know how many programs are operating locally ; they estimate twelve to 18 . <P> Several programs have had meager results . WIN ( for Work INcentive ) . which trains welfare mothers for such jobs as clerk and keypunch operator , enrolls about 120,000 women a year , but 70% drop out before finishing the three-to six-month course , mostly because of physical or emotional problems , including drug addiction . The Job Corps , which houses youths in camps in order to take them out of a ghetto environment while providing training , has attracted only 21,000 to its 71 centers , which have a capacity of 25,000 . Many youngsters prefer even slums to the barracks-like camps .
