of the world of letters , now lives in Danby , Vermont . And just what is this fabulous eighty-year-old lady  --  winner of the Nobel prize for literature in 1938 ; author of over eighty published books and innumerable shorter pieces ; the most translated author in all of American literature , with some ninety publishers abroad ; virtually worshipped as a sage in the Orient and a celebrity at home in constant demand for personal appearances ; sometime resident of China , Japan , India , Java , Russia , England , France , Switzerland , and the United States ; whose autograph alone has been known to add $50.00 to the price of one of her books ; who has walked with kings and princes , presidents and peasants  --  just what is this remarkable personage doing in this out-of-the-way corner of a hideaway state ? Retiring ? No : merely beginning a new life . Figuratively , she is bringing back nightingales into a garden where they once sang . Pearl Buck has elected to take a little village , lost in time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its soul . Pride it once had , and justifiably . Once upon a year Danby was famous for its superb marble , quarried from the mountain which rises steeply above the one-horse main street . Lordly buildings in Washington contain Danby marble . The Supreme Court building and the John F. Kennedy Memorial were fashioned of it . Danby residents are proud of the fact that most of the cellars in their modest homes have marble floors . Doorsteps and lintels are of pure marble , for once the valuable stone was as easy to come by in Danby as sawdust in a lumber town . But the harsh realities of 1972 's economics loom larger than sentiment . It is cheaper now to import marble from Italy than to quarry it in Vermont . Today the fabled quarry is deserted except for the snakes and small game which find its geometric crevices and gaping caverns a home fashioned to their liking . The village itself , which once bustled with activity and boasted thirteen primary school districts , now has one school and the community pulse has slowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imperious lady who was thought to have left her heart in a similar village in old China but now has found it again in the green hills of Vermont . In advance of going to visit her in Vermont , I had heard rumors that Pearl Buck had " bought " an entire village and apparently was planning to operate it along feudal lines , in which she was to be the Grand Duchess and bend it to her will . It almost sounded like a return to nineteenth-century " company " towns , complete with a company store and a private constabulary to keep out labor unions . But the facts are certainly less melodramatic and wholly reassuring . Miss Buck tells it this way : " Danby ? What I saw was a lovely old village , but it was dying . I could see that at a glance . I had seen many a dead and dying village in many places in our beloved country . North and South . East and West , but especially in the West . I know the signs- - the closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pain tless walls , a handful of people still clinging to the only home they know  --  a sad and heartbreaking sight . Since I must always know the why of all I see and experience , I stopped often at these villages to ask where nearly everyone was gone and why were they gone  --  and would they never come back ? The answers were always the same . Once upon a lime the village had been a small prosperous center of an industry centered at a crossroads of a natural resource . But time passes as it will and must , industries opened elsewhere , the natural resource was exhausted , there was nothing to keep the young people in the village , and with the young goes the life of any village . One can not blame them for going , since to stay is death , but they take life with them . " And so I was sad when I came upon the village of Danby and saw its dying plight . Most of the center of the village was dead  --  houses . withou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grocery store still alive , a struggling church , a post-office in a room in a building that had once been line . " That was what struck my first attention . Danby had once been a beautiful village . It was dying , but it was still beautiful . The country store was unusual in its structure and design . The houses had not been built originally for poor people . We bought the store and searched the region for books about Danby . There was no doubt about its decline . So evident was it that an aged resident , who had spent his life here , said that the villagers had been trying to collect enough money to burn down the country store and all surrounding houses and persuade some modern shopping center to buy the land ! I shuddered as I read the old town history books . For Danby was never an ordinary village . No wonder the houses , dilapidated though most of them were . are fine houses , well built by people who had worked and received good pay  --  once upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Danby . And the residents have joined in the renaissance . Miss Buck realizes that " It would be easy to bring in a construction company and get it all done fast , but instead we have incorporated the Danby Construction and Decorating Company , made up of Danby young men . " She continues with a bit of roguishness that she purchased a row of houses along Danby 's Main Street ( which , by the way , unsettled real estate prices so much that now , if she innocently happens to admire a flower garden next to a house , the owner may quadruple the property evaluation overnight ! ) and then rented them out to proprietors of antique shops who have brought them back into shipshape condition and are stocking them with some of the finest furniture , glassware , silver , and oddities to be found anywhere in that heaven of antique collectors , New England . And the people like it . Not all of the people , naturally , since it is human nature to resist change , even when not to have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans for Danby , Miss Buck is as inscrutable as her beloved East . They are hidden away in her head . But one thing at least is certain : Danby has a present now where only a short time ago , it only had a past . And , thanks to her , it also has a future . Danby is definitely on the map to stay : the nightingales are back in the garden . Route #7 to Danby , again a town well worth visiting thanks to Pearl Buck , cuts straight down a valley with ancient forested hills rising steeply on either side . It winds past the Rutland airport where little two-motored jobs sideslip and bump down onto Vermont ground almost apologetically . A couple of miles further down the pike , a stream dashes abruptly down from the mountain and crosses under a Main Street bridge at right angles . The little road leading from Route #7 at the bridge hits Danby 's only street at the head of a T. To your left the statue of a Union soldier , eternally vigilant , stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the few buildings in Danby which catch the eye , and you look over the hood of the car directly at the three-story frame building which once was the pride and joy of the state , a " skyscraper " celebrating the eminence of a settlement with its own millionaires and a natural asset which anyone in his right mind could see would never run out of its shrouded treasures . ( I am reminded of a classic and unforgettable Webster cartoon . A prosperous businessman of about 1910 , handsomely moustachioed and with heavy watch chain over rounded midsection , is reassuring a worried associate . " Nonsense , " says he , " 1 tell you that while they still make crackers , we 'll make the barrels to put them in . " ) The skyscraper looks merely cozy to the modern eye . too . It is gaily screened with hanging pots of flowers . morning glories and begonias . and suddenly the eye catches a flash of startling blue , bluer than any Vermont blue . It is Miss Buck 's dress , a cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peacock 's tail in a land of jade . She is ensconced in one of her favorite spots , where she can look up and down the street  --  the whole length of the town  --  and across the Common to the mountains beyond . And there she holds court for the world , which is beginning to come to her , even as I did . One passes through the general store on the way upstairs . The nice old country things  --  candy in jars , corncob pipes , country linens  --  but there are also shelves crowded with Pearl Buck books . She will autograph one for a visitor who asks . Up the stairs and through the antique shop to where she sits on the little flowered porch , like a queen in a fairy tale of long ago . I can not help myself . I have never met her before and it is love at first sight . I hear myself saying : " I think I have waited all my life to meet you . " Her head wears a luminous crown of white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And that blue , blue , dress . ( I am to see her later in red , and then silver . ) She is simply , unconquerably beautiful . We lunch , and I soon discover that Pearl Buck belongs to all the world . A lady who has bought a book downstairs enters , and breathlessly and even desperately asks if Miss Buck will autograph it and may they have their picture taken together ? Pearl Buck gravely assents , since it is all too clear that if the lady were denied she might just go to pieces on the spot . The deed is done and the lady departs , clutching her book to her ample bosom , smiling beatifically , and clearly determined to break every speed law during her trip home to get that picture developed . An elderly couple comes in . They are of retirement age , well-dressed , relined . They stand awkwardly in front of Miss Buck . Something tense is in the air , and we learn what it is when the man speaks testily to his wife . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you said you would . Go ahead and ask her . " The man reacts as I did : he is captivated . Suddenly his wife finds her tongue and they both ply Miss Buck with questions , like children asking their teacher Why . She answers them , in that beautiful modulated voice , the words like something in a classic book . ( In a later conversation , Miss Buck explains to me what has been called her " Biblical style " of writing and speaking . She reveals that since she grew up in China , she learned first to think and then speak in Chinese . She still thinks in Chinese and then translates it into English speech . Those lovely cadences and rhythms are the music of the Chinese language , and she takes no credit for it . I know better , because what she says is of even more importance than how she says it . But I hold my peace on that score with her , until this moment of writing . ) The lady blurts out what is on her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Communists , you know , and all that . What does Miss Buck think about it ? Pearl Buck answers . The voice is low and musical , the words are shaped like pearls on black velvet . The lady 's eyes open wider and wider , as Miss Buck speaks fondly of China- its culture and history stretching into antiquity ; how the Chinese discovered gunpowder but used it only for fireworks until the West turned it on them as a weapon ; how the great Empire had tutored the world , absorbed its enemies , and created sophisticated works of art and sublime philosophies when the inhabitants of the British Isles were still painting themselves blue and were religious victims of a tree cult . Pearl Buck autographs the book for them . She holds the felt-tipped pen very much like a brush . The characters of her letters of her name appear on the page almost vertically . Chinese-type characters , each a little drawing . The couple thank her and they leave . When they arrived at the porch , they were tense , frowning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaily , and laughing . This moment on the little porch is clearly the highlight of their whole trip from Maryland . Some alchemy has worked upon them . They are eloquent and easy spoken . Veteran China Watchers who see things from The Broad Perspective . Pearl Buck watches them go , bemused . " They are nice people , " she says . Pearl Buck walks the streets of Danby every day , summer and winter . She has devised a choice of rive routes , compounded of a road or two coming down from the back country into Main Street . This now is her village , this is the good earth , and its people . She loves them all . They come out and pass the time of day with her , and she often goes inside for a visit . This is a village where everybody 's children are everybody 's children and , after just a couple of hours in Danby , even the dogs are old and familiar friends , encountered in a dozen places . In one of her books Pearl Buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom . The family was the basic part of the village structure . The unemployed or the sick or the aged had no fears then ? the uncles and the sisters and the cousins and the aunts were all in the same family compound and , poor or no , all sustained the one . The Chinese were so well aware of this strength that when they built a walled city they were always careful to include within its confines a quantity of peasant family farms . The latter insured that the community would never be starved out or lack for the agrarian muscles which had made China great . * * * Everywhere she goes , Pearl Buck is at the center . Tourists spy her on the Danby street in her long silk dress and straw hat ( even in winter , wearing boots in the snow , she insists on the beautiful long silk dresses ) , and I see their lips move : " There she is ! That 's Pearl Buck . " A couple of teen-agers , passing us in the opposite direction as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they are open-eyed at her presence , the majestic mien and remote con templative gaze . They have never seen anyone like her before : they may never again , and somehow they sense this . She just affects people this way . A Korean on her staff says , " She is the reincarnation of a great soul . " He looks meaningfully al me . He has in mind a god . One member of her staff firmly believes she should be our first female President of the United States , another Indira Gandhi of India , or Goida Meir of Israel . Her character is not a mystery but a monument . She has inherited the strength and wisdom of the ages . And yet she is almost painfully alive . She is so sensitive to suffering and so deeply aware of beauty that loneliness must per force be her only true companion . This may well be the price of her great gifts . But what gifts ! Pause over some of the things she has said : I am always moved , with grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few who are prying or meanly critical , for the very few who rejoice in the grief of others , there are the thousands who are kind . I have come to believe that the natural human heart is good , and I have observed that this goodness is found in all varieties of people , and that it can and does prevail in spite of other corruptions , This human goodness alone provides hope enough for the world . Endurance of inescapable sorrow is something which has to be learned alone . And only to endure is not enough . Endurance can be a harsh and bitter root in one 's life , bearing poisonous and gloomy fruit , destroying other lives . Endurance is only the beginning . There must be acceptance and tit. ' knowledge that sorrow fully accepted brings its own gifts . For there is an alchemy in sorrow . It can be transmuted into wisdom , which , if it does not bring joy , can yet bring happiness . It is less necessary to be anxious about the weak than the strong in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred ways , they are fed , they are clothed and provided with either no effort on their part or at most only so much as they are able to make . But who takes care of the strong ? Nu one . It is considered that they must be able to care for themselves and they manage it in one way or another because they must , because they know they have only themselves upon whom to depend . If they were given a tenth of the aid , sympathy , compassion , which are given as a matter of course to the weak , the helpless , the ineffectual , they might be more gentle , more compassionate , too , and the world be better for it . For my part I pity the strong . I think we Americans , being so young and unsophisticated , have a completely wrong idea of what true sophistication is . According to Asian definition , which I myself believe to be correct , a sophisticated person is one who has experienced everything , knows everything , and has reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this kind of wisdom , add the poetry that is Pearl Buck : Where , then , is the beauty of China ? Not on the surface of things , anyway . But I bide my time . For it is here . Some of the rarest bits of beauty in the world I have found in this old country , so reserved , so indolent for centuries , so careless of what the world thinks of her . For China does not express herself in show places . Even in Peking , that bourne of all tourists to the Far East , the things that one sees are not show places . The Forbidden City , the Temple of Heaven , the Lama Temple - these and a host of the others were built up slowly out of the life of the people , for the people themselves , with no thought originally of tourist eyes and dollars . Indeed , for decades , no amount of money could purchase a glimpse of them . The Chinese have naturally little idea of exhibition and advertising . Go into any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will find a decorous , dark , quiet interior , with shelves and shelves of neat packages folded away . each with its price tag symmetrically arranged . There are no pedestals with gorgeous satins folded cunningly to catch the light and entice the buyer . But a clerk comes forward , and when you have made known your wishes , he selects carelessly half a dozen packages from the shelves and tears off the paper wrappers . Suddenly before your eyes bursts the splendor of stuffs whereof kings ' robes are made . Brocaded satins and velvets , silk of marvellous brilliance and delicacy of shades are massed before you in a bewildering confusion . It is like a crowd of magnificently hued but terflies released from dull cocoons . You make your choice and the glory is all shut away again into the dark . That is China . Her beauties are those of old things , old places carefully fashioned with the loftiest thought and artistic endeavor of generations of aristocrats , and now like their owners , falling gently into decay . Behind this high wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one may step , if one has the proper key , into a gracious courtyard , paved with great square old tiles , worn away by the feet of a hundred centuries . There is a gnarled pine tree , a pool of goldfish , a carver , stone seat whereon is seated a white-haired grandfather , dignified and calm as an old Buddha in his gown of cream-colored silk . In his pale , withered hand he holds a long pipe of polished black wood , tipped with silver . If you are his friend , he will rise with deep bows and escort you with a most perfect courtesy into the guest hall . There in a high chair of a carved teak you may sip his famous tea and marvel at the old paintings hung in silken scrolls upon the walls , and meditate upon the handwrought beams of the ceiling , thirty feet above . Beauty , beauty everywhere , stately and reserved with age . I mind me of a great dark guest hall in a temple , which faces out upon a tiny sunny courtyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray brick . Here every spring the great pink shoots push up , and when I go there in May , the sunlight is pouring down upon the deeply tinted peonies , glowing in reds and dusky pinks , and in the center creamy ones with golden hearts . The terrace is cleverly placed so that the guests must needs look upon it from the dimness of the interior . What words could be spoken , what thought shaped in such a place , save those of purest beauty ! There are old paintings , old embroideries , potteries and porcelains and brasses , hidden away preciously by families who owned them before America was thought of ; indeed , perhaps they are of an age with Pharoah 's treasures-who knows ? * * * It is only an American , born and reared in an alien country , who can appreciate fully the amazing beauty of the American woods in autumn . Inexplicably , no one had prepared me for it . I had lived all my days in a calm Chinese landscape , lovely in its way with delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pools . It was gently colorful , too , in blues and greens , with a semi-tropic effulgence of sunshine , and a piercing starriness of night . But when summer was gone , and chrysanthemums had glowed and faded , the colors were put away for the most part until the next spring . The trees dropped their leaves softly , turning the while to a quiet , neutral brown , without any great ado about it , and almost overnight we were in decent and sober winter garb . The earth took on a dull monotony of hue , which the little thatched farmhouses of adobe did not relieve . Even the people retired into enormous padded garments of dark blue and black . Thus when , after a loitering journey eastward , I found myself walking through a wood in Virginia , how can I put the excitement of it into words ! No one had told me how paganly gorgeous it would be . Oh , of course they had said , " The leaves turn in the fall , you know , " but how does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tans and faint rose reds . Instead , I found myself in a living blaze of color-robust , violent , vivid beyond belief . I shall never forget one tall tree trunk wrapped about with a vine of flaming scarlet , standing outlined , a fiery sentinel , against a dark rocky cliff . There was a maple walk which might have been the pathway to the golden streets of the New Jerusalem . Wandering anywhere , above crimson and seal brown , and yellow of purest quality . One walked on a carpet of hues which an emperor 's wealth could not buy in a Peking rug . Even the quite tiny things , small vines and plantlets that must have been meek little things in summer , expressed themselves in the most outrageous and unrestrained colors , Well ! There can be nothing like it on this earth . Do the Americans realize it every year , I wonder ? if you have not as yet discovered the enchantment in the many worlds of Pearl Buck , you should , for one of the secrets of her literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based upon her personal experiences in so many far places : When I went to North China to live , I did not eat rice but wheaten breads with vegetables and infrequent bits of meat . Featherlike twisted crullers , salt and not sweet , and tea made breakfast , with dates and persimmons for fruits , or roasted bread , paper-thin and a foot in diameter , wrapped around chopped garlic . For the second meal of the day , since in North China people eat only two meals a day except in the harvest season , we ate noodles aril/or bread roasted against coal embers and dotted with sesame seeds , or steamed bread-rolls filled with chopped meat and garlic , or boiled dumplings , very small and dainty and filled with bits of meat and fresh ginger , or with chopped spinach and bean vermicelli , I am never in the least homesick for past worlds , for I live in the present , yet I come nearest to nostalgia when I think of the variety of Chinese food . Each province had its own fruits and vegetables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dish or other , and every restaurant had its specialty and every family its private recipes , and no one thought of food and cooking with anything except lyric pleasure . Tire other evening , sitting with Chinese friends here upon my own terrace , we remembered together a few of the most famous dishes of our childhood world-the Yellow River fish soup so deliciously cooked in Ching-chow , the steamed shad of West Lake , the cured fish and beef of Chang-sha , the plum flower fragrant salted fish of Chao-chow , the steamed crabs of Soochow , the sweet and sour fish of Peking , and the dried shrimps of Tung-ting Lake . A nd of wines , the best , we agreed , was the Shao-hsing wine of Chekiang , and then the Mao-tai wine of Kweichow and the distilled Pen-chow liquor of Shansi . And of teas the green Lung-ching tea of Chekiang was our favorite but also the Pu-erh tea of Yunnan , plucked from the mountain named ru-erh , and the Chi-men red tea , and the Lin-an green tea of Anking or the jasmine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how chrysanthemum tea , Pearl Buck has an office on the third floor of her skyscraper . Bookcases to the ceiling . Priceless Oriental artifacts . A great desk . Continued on pane 135 Comfortable chairs and settees for visiting . But her residence is just a step away from Main Street , on the West Danby road , an even smaller hamlet a few miles over the mountain on a high and forlorn plateau . The house is a bleak old frame building with no claim to architectural beauty . The mountain stream tumbles beside it , and sometimes Pearl Buck sits by her very own flume cut out by centuries of falling water , close to a pothole where the cold water swirls , twenty feet across and twenty feet deep , clear as crystal and shadowed by trout lurking in its depths . From this sylvan mood outside , one steps through the door of Pearl Buck 's home into a setting of patrician and cosmopolitan elegance . Entering the living room , one has a sense of being touched by greatness in many forms . A beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A memento of Sarojini Naidu , the Indian poetess . Fabulous pictorial art  --  the brooding figure of a Chinese Mandarin . Pearl Buck is a sculptress , among other things , and the room reflects this . She takes pleasure in shapes . Over yonder is a nobly proportioned and obviously priceless battalion of chessmen : she is a formidable opponent , naturally , in any joust of the mind . Beyond that is the grand piano , with an inspiring bit of sculpture near the keyboard  --  the hands of the great Polish virtuoso and patriot , Ignace Paderewski , whom Pearl Buck knew . She herself plays with polished expertness  --  Bach , Beethoven , Vivaldi  --  and I am told that she could have been a great composer , had she attempted it . An interesting facet of her mind is her method of playing her music . She will take up a book of Beethoven Sonatas , for instance , with no riffling through the pages . She starts at the first , and plays on through in order , in an unconscious revelation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having written an entire library of books and an untold number of articles , stories , and poems , denies that she is currently writing five books at the same time . " Only three , " she says . " The other two I am writing in my head . " There is a desk upstairs in her apartment on the second floor of her house , looking out into the woods . There she writes in her careful longhand , using a tiny brush made of mouse hair , Chinese style . When she is not writing , she is reading . She started reading Charles Dickens when she was four , and she has never stopped devouring books . There is one in every room of her house  --  she is reading them all simultaneously as one might enjoy at the same time the company of a group of friends . One of her staff says : " She has a burning sensation of not havingenough time to write all of the books that she wants to write . " Here is how she describes her creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more than this- a human creature born abnormally , inhumanly sensitive . To him a touch is a blow , a sound is a noise , a misfortune is a tragedy , a joy is an ecstasy , a friend is a lover , a lover is a god , and failure is death . Add to this cruelly delicate organism the overpowering necessity to create to create to create- so that without the creating of music or poetry or books or buildings or something of beauty and meaning his very breath is cut off from him . Ile must create . He must pour out creation . By some strange unknown pressing inward urgency he is not really alive unless he is creating . The merest conversation with Pearl Buck is fuel enough for a lifetime in certain ways , and we spent hours on every imaginable subject . One needs to know something about her past not to be entirely overwhelmed by the richness and variety of her mind . It is a past varied in both practical and emotional experience on which she has built her ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few months after her birth in America her father and mother returned to China to carry on their missionary work . Her life was extraordinary in China . She was tutored simultaneously as a Chinese child and as an American child . She never went to any formal school , yet at fifteen she could , and did , pass t he entrance examination at Wellesley College . She never went there , however , since her many relatives in America were Southerners , and they prevailed upon her to attend Randolph Macon , in Virginia . She was lonely because she was different- a Chinese girl with a Western exterior . There is no doubt but that she was always a genius . At Randolph Macon and later on when she studied at Cornell , she won every prize in writing she went after , although always to her surprise . But her genius has been that of truth rather than the flourish of a writing style . That is why The Good Earth , which sold one million eight hundred and eleven thousand copies in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize in literature . That is why , as I mentioned before , she is the most translated of any American author . This is not to compare Mark Twain and Pearl Buck as to quality , for they are two different coins . But he is second to her in translation into foreign languages , and so far behind  --  a point the irascible old boy would relish  --  he has no chance of catching up . It is undoubtedly because what she has to say goes continued from page 135 to the heart of everyone , regardless of nationality or race , like a shaft of light . At the banquet following the presentation of the Nobel Prize to Pearl Buck , Herr Lindlbad , Swedish Professor of Astronomy , said : " You have in your liter feel that Madame 's early Americanization at Wellesley made her a little uppity , and they would refer to her as " the college girl , " like a glossy product of some high-toned girl 's school who came back to the farm and was ashamed of the homely qualities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew the Communists after that and has always opposed them , although her hope is that the vast and eternal quality of China will in turn absorb that form of government and yield a return to true democracy . In the same remarkable sense of being so far ahead of her time , Pearl Buck 's acceptance of the Nobel Prize contained remarks which should gladden the disturbed hearts Continued on page 141 ary works , which are of the highest quality , advanced the understanding and appreciation in the Western world of a great and important part of mankind , the people of China . You have taught us by your works to see the individuals in this great mass of people , you have shown us the rise and fall of families , and the land as the foundation upon which families are built . In this you have taught us to see those qualities of thought and feelings which bind us all together as human beings on this Earth , and you have given us Westerners something of China 's soul . When by the development of technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , the surface of the Earth shrinks . East and West are no longer separated by almost insuperable voids and distance , and when on the other hand , partly as a natural effect of this phenomenon , the differences of national character and ambitions clash to form dangerous discontinuities , it is of the greatest importance that the peoples of the Earth learn to understand each other as individuals across distances and frontiers . When works of literature succeed in this respect they are certainly in a very direct way idealistic in the sense in which this word was meant by Alfred Nobel . " The Professor 's words take on added meaning today , many years after , as our country takes steps to bridge the gap between the West and the East .

Space simply does not permit me to record even briefly the vast scope and comprehension of any conversation with Pearl Buck . It ranges from humorous little asides to the most transcendent matters . One of the asides concerned my observation that she had no pets about her , this woman of the loving heart . ( There is a forty-year-old parrot squawking out in the kitchen of her home as we converse , mixing it up with choice Korean and English expletives. and salted with the whew WHEW kind of whistle American truck drivers direct at pretty girls , but the bird belongs to her chef . ) So Miss Buck tells me that she had always favored pets , but in the end she had to give them up because of their insistence on her time , which she so needs for her creative work . The last pet was a baby pig , for instance . He had been , of course , the runt of a litter when she first saw him at a nearby farm , and destined for extinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the competition of his hardier littermates . She took him home and treated him like a poodle , until in time he not only stood outside of her study door squealing for attention when she needed most to be at her writing , but insisted on being carried around in her arms , even after he had reached a sizeable adult porkerhood . He was regretfully returned to the farm , where she at least had the satisfaction of noting that his superior diet and life as a self-elected human being gave him an immediate superiority over his former littermates , and he went on to great things as the king of the barnyard . More serious topics in our conversation range from the Dail Lama , whom she knows personally and visited in his court of exile at the foot of the Himalayas in India , to Tibetan death rites , American publishing , education , and the plight of American children who are not prepared for adult living . ( In Japan , even a baby strapped to his mother 's back sees the world from the eye level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A day with her is an education , both spiritually and intellectually . Seeing her walk about Danby , play the regal hostess over an exquisitedinner in her home , or just poke about her beloved flea market behind the general store ( where I counted eighteen tents to house the antiques and whatnots set out for both trade and public ) is to realize that here is a woman who has emerged triumphant over life . But as all conversations in the end come around to life 's mysteries , it is here wherein Pearl Buck has penetrated so deeply in her eventful and sometimes tragic life , Here she reaches heights of intellectual and spiritual power which are strangely moving . One feels as if Pearl Buck can draw back the veil on things the rest of us only dimly sense . Pearl Buck , often , brings to her conversation her father , dead for many years , as well as her beloved husband , whom she has lost more recently . She tells me how , after the death of her husband , her journeys took her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a state of numbed shock . No doubt even this heroic person wondered if she could go on . Yet she had told others that it could be done . So she would try . This is Pearl Buck telling about her battle . And I think you could do worse than read these words aloud to someone you love , so that you may find still another to visit , as I did , in Pearl Buck 's shining land of the mind : When I was a child and often reluctant to do my duty , my father used to say to me firmly but gently , " If you will not do it because it is right , then do it for the greater glory of God . " For the greater glory of God , then , and for my father 's sake , though still reluctant , I did do what had to be done , at least as often as possible . Now to return to the apartment . I did not once see it while it was being decorated . When all was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big window . It was a bright day , I remember , one of New York 's best , the air fresh from the sea and the sky blue . And facing me , across the building , under the eaves and along the roof , I saw these words carved in huge stone letters : AD MAIOREM DEL CLORIAM " To the greater glory of God . " What does it mean , this voice from the grave , my father 's grave ? He lies buried on a mountaintop in the very heart of a China lost to me . I am here and alive and thousands of miles away . Are we in communication , my husband and I , through my father ? It is not possible . How dare I say it is noO Some day we shall know . What day ? That day , perhaps , when saints and scientists unite to make a total search for truth , It is the saints , the believers , who should have the courage to urge the scientists to help them discover whether the spirit continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceases to be the container . Faith supplies the hypothesis , but only science can provide the computer for verification . The unbeliever will never pursue the search . He is already static , a pillar of salt , forever looking backward . There are no miracles , of that I am sure . If one walks on water and heals the sick and raises the dead to life again , it is not a matter of magic but a matter of knowing how to do it . There is no supernatural : there is only the supremely ? natural , the purely scientific Science and religion , religion and science , put it as I may . they are two sides of the same glass , through which we set . darkly until these two , focus . ing together , reveal the truth . On the day when the message comes through from over the far horizon where dwells " that great majority , " the dead , the proof will reach us , not as a host of angels in the sky but as a wave length recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal as the fingerprint belonging to someone whose body is dust . Then the scientist , recognizing the wave length , will exclaim , " But that 's someone I know ! I took his wave length before he died. - And he will compare his record with the wave length just recorded and will know that at last a device , a machine , is able to receive a message dreamed of for centuries , the message of the continuing individual existence , which we call the immortality of the soul . Or perhaps it will not be a scientist who receives , but a woman , waiting at a window open to the sky .
