txt Letters to the Editor Letters to the Editor What Westway Funds Could Do for Transit To the Editor : My effort to pave the way legislatively for a trade-in of West Side interstate highway money for masstransit funding is far from shortsighted , as was suggested in a recent letter . I have long been convinced that the plan to build a huge interstate highway on the West Side was not only a serious threat to the communities along its route but an invitation to bring still more undesirable and unnecessary auto traffic info Manhattan , an idea both environmentally unsound and wasteful of energy . Using the present $550 million tradein value of the proposed interstate for modernization of our mass-transit system would provide a needed boost for our city 's economy , create many jobs and also greatly benefit riders . However , even more money may become available . Under an Abzug-Kennedy amendment approved by both the House and Senate in December , we may expect an interstate transfer value of up to $1 billion , nearly double the old trade-in expectation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities . . What could the money be used for ? A memorandum prepared for me by a group of mass-transit specialists and environmentalists cited cost estimates of a number of . projects , including : Air-conditioning on all IRT rolling stock not subject to replacement , $86 million ; modernizing stations ' at Wall Street , South Ferry , Fulton Street , Grand Central-IRT Lexington , Times Square and 72d Street and Broadway , $66 million ; facilitating transfer points in the Bronx , Brooklyn and Manhattan , $20.5 million : fluorescent lighting above platform edges , passage . The Unprotested Murder To the Editor : ' Like many Americans , I am incensed that no steps were taken to protest the murder of an American official while returning from his office to his home in Greece . Shortly thereafter a British doctor on returning to England informed officials that she had been mistreated in Chile . The British Foreign Office immediately withdrew its Ambassador from that country . This is just what we should have done and perhaps also sent a part of our Mediterranean fleet to the waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world , but if its foreign officers , while on official duty , can be murdered with impunity , we shall command no respect . In this Bicentennial year , some of us remember John Paul Jones and Teddy Roosevelt and many others who upheld our honor even under difficult conditions . Can we no longer do the same ? JOHN H. G. PELL New York , Jan. 2 , 1976 ? Flawed Angola Analogy To the Editor : The Congress , apprehensive of seeing a Vietnam-style involvement in Angola , is opposing further U.S. aid to F.N.L.A. , and UNITA . But there is no similarity between Vietnam and Angola . Unlike the Vietcong , the M.P.L.A. has no outside sanctuary , no exclusive claim to past anticolonial struggle , no To the Editor : Herbert Bienstock letter Dec. 18 attacks me for " sloppy scholarship " and " nonsense " for assertions I made in a Dec. 8 Op-Ed article . Mr. Bienstock disputes my correlating census figures about people listed as of " Polish " and " Russian " origin with Jewish people . This presumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistently lists only Yiddish as the original language of the Russian group . Moreover , virtually every scholar in the field has made the same correlation for years . Furthermore , studies independent of census data consistently confirm the educational and economic rank of Jews among ethnic groups . For example , Stephen Steinberg 's report prepared for the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education , " The Academic Melting Pot , " 1974 , lists the " index of representation " or " ratio of the proportion in higher education against the proportion in the national average " for college faculty as follows : Catholic 72 percent ; Protestant 100 percent ; Jewish 272 percent ; the index of college graduates is : Catholic 98 percent ; Protestant 87 percent ; Jewish 312 percent ( see pp. 100-103 ) . Andrew Greeley in " Ethnicity in the United States . " 1974 , reports that Jews have by far the highest percentage among them of college graduates of all ethnic groups : German Jewish 23.3 percent ; ways , control areas , S52 million : upgrading the tracks on IRT , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely useful project would be extension of the Flushing Line via ' 41st Street through the Lincoln Tunnel to North Bergen , N.J. No doubt the millions or New Yorkers who daily endure the increasing discomfort of subway and bus rides have many other ideas on what can be done to make our mass-transit facilities more efficient and attractive . These can be presented at public hearings . Certainly there may be disagreement as to which projects should have priority , but I think there can be little doubt that there is a greater need to improve mass transit for the benefit of residents and help rejuvenate our economy than to build another superhighway that skirts our city for the benefit of those passing through .

It is the U.S.S.R. , through its proxy Cuba , which assumes the " American posture " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhospitable environment , with . its own supply lines stretching across the ocean and with the opposite side benefiting from nearby sanctuaries . Since the U.S.S.R. is not likely to repeat American mistakes and extend its involvement much further , a limited U. S. material aid to the opposite side can not exacerbate the situation . A default presents more risks . ( Prof. ) MICHAEL RYWKIN Russian Area Studies , City College New York , Dec. 24 , 1975 ? Friends of All Animals To the Editor : Mr. Singer 's facts are in error OpEd Dec. 27 . He has neglected to do his homework on animal welfare societies . The A.S.P.C.A. is interested in all animals  --  not simply dogs and cats . Name the abused animal , and we will go to its assistance . The first requisite of a humane society is to stand up to " powerful interests . " Respectability or good intentions ' do not count in the long run . Neither will Mr. Singer 's generalities suffice . To the best of our financial ability , we speak for all animals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , A.S.P.C.A.

At the bottom are blacks , 4 percent ; Spanishspeaking background . 4.1 percent , and Polish-Americans and Italian-Americans , each with 5.1 percent . Mr. Bienstock is a veteran statistician and knows these facts and practices . He hurls charges at me of unfairness to Jews . No attack on Jews was intended , or stated , in my article , nor should anyone read any into it . I listed Jews , and other ethnics , merely to show the parameters of income and education among American groups . Mr. Bienstock has no real argument against my piece but is using his title as " government statistician " in an attempt to discredit what he misperceives as an attack on his ethnic group . The point of my article holds : There is a hierarchy of ethnic groups in the United States as measured by income , education and occupational status , and the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a thesis Mr. Bienstock carefully avoids contesting . As to Mr. Bienstock 's moralizing that one should not he polemic about these matters , should we take his letter as our model ? ( Assoc . Prof. ) RICHARD GAMBINO Queens College Flushing , N. Y. , Dec. 19 , 1975 On Fighting Corruption , ro the Editor : It is essential for the effective enforcement of integrity in the criminal justice system and the maintenance of public confidence that the future of the Office of the Special Prosecutor not be obscured or hastily decided by the controversy surrounding Mr. Nadjari . The policy issues involved are far more controversial , substantalive and vital than the personality issues raised in the current controversy . Let us recall the revelations of the Knapp Commission hearings and pay particular attention to the commission 's recommendations . 1 . It advised the Governor to appoint a Special Deputy Attorney general " to investigate and prosecute all crimes involving corruption in the criminal process . " He was to proceed beyond the police corruption investigations of the commission by checking on " accusations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was to have jurisdiction in the five ? counties ' of the city because " corruption patterns do not stop at county lines , and jurisdictional niceties have often severely hampered corruption investigations . " 3 . His term should be limited to five years , when " it should be possible ... to make an informed judgment whether he should continue to supplement regular anticorruption efforts . . . " In response to these recommendations , Governor Rockefeller established the Office of the Special Prosecutor on Sept. 19 , 1972 . At the same time , the Governor requested the State Commission of Investigation to conduct a study of the criminal justice system . In its report , issued in 1975 , the commission pointed out that the inadequate management of the criminal justice system " literally invited corruption in some areas . " A task force 's evaluation of the , Office of the Special Prosecutor . coneluded last April that the office was working effectively with the Police Department in rooting out police corruption , but that the investigations of the other aspects of the criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluation . The decision regarding the continuation of the office and the appointment of another Special Prosecutor could best be made after there is an objective and deliberative study and public discussion of the future of the office and its mission . Otherwise , innuendoes and accusations will continue to tax the public 's shaken faith in the criminal justice system . MILTON MUSICUS Albany , Jan. 3 , 1976 The writer was director of the federally sponsored study of the Special Prosecutor 's Office . ? The Crime Promoters To the Editor : It is discouraging to see the newspapers regularly quoting politicians ' statements that today 's breakdown of the criminal justice system is caused by too little money for the courts . Is it not transparently more accurate to say that the cause is too many crimi-nals ? It is tempting to wonder if it is all one big conspiracy . Are plea bargaining ' and slap-on-the-wrist sentencing practiced by prosecutors , lawyers and judges in the subconscious knowledge that this encourages crime and thus escalates the number of jobs available for prosecutors , lawyers and judges ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , certain and stiff justice might reduce crime ? The other extreme seems obvious . Just sentence each new convict to one week on parole and the need for prisons will disappear . But can you imagine the resulting explosion in crime and in the magnitude of the justice system we would need ? That is exactly where we 're now heading . A constructive suggestion might be to work for a five-year test of prompt , certain and stiff justice in a few typical counties or states . The public deserves documented proof of the results of such a policy . I have never seen The Times report such data if they exist . E. L. MCCANDLESS White Plains , Jan. 2 , 1976 ? To Catch a Bus To the Editor : Bus stops here are a lottery game for New Yorkers  --  for visitors from abroad they are a despair . This superlative city has the most primitive approach in this matter : painted yellow lines in mostly faded condition , a small sign saying " Bus Stop , " topped by that paradoxical-sounding inscription " No Standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , seeing other people stand , they stand too . Where , oh where , are the big , clearly informative posters found in all big European cities , exactly describing the complete route of every passing bus ? Most visitors have learned to read and would not have to frantically ask the overworked driver if he were going their way . Even born New Yorkers badly need this simple help : easily readable posters carrying the direction of each passing bus . On Fifth Avenue there are a great many bus stops all along . But while you patiently wait , only stopless buses pass , carrying with them the mystery of their schedule . Some bus shelters have been lately provided for the public . What about a good deed that would not cost this city more . billions and would prove a tranquilizer both to passengers and bus drivers ? Will the real bus stop please stand up !
