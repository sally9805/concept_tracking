txt Crown Zellerbach Corp . expects to spend about $125 million next year on paper mills , box plants , sawmills and other production facilities . That sizable outlay will follow investments estimated at $110 million to $115 million this year . At first glance , such major spending by the San Francisco-based paper and woodproducts company would appear to promise gleaming new plants , work for hundreds of construction workers , new jobs for many mill hands and an enlarged market for loggers . But it does n't . The huge outlay will just keep Crown Zellerbach 's present plants running . " We will continue with mandatory spending to meet environmental requirements at our plants , and to handle normal maintenance and equipment replacement , but we wo n't begin any big new projects , " a company official says . Crown Zellerbach is typical of major corporations these days . With many factories running far below capacity , interest rates remaining high and the economic outlook still cloudy , companies are budgeting 1976 capital spending cautiously . They are completing expansions already begun and making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities or major expansions . Deceptive Statistics This caution will be masked in the many year-end capital spending projections by government and private economists , however . In fact , such estimates generally will show 1975 and 1976 corporate capital spending at record levels . The latest Commerce Department projection for 1975 puts total outlays at $113.51 billion , up 1% from the record $112.4 billion last year . Spending next year may again rise a bit , with higher investment by electric and telephone companies offsetting a slight reduction by manufacturers . Some more-optimistic forecasts envision a second half rise in manufacturers ' outlays producing an overall increase of 10% or more for the entire year . The annual fall survey of Inc. , for example . projects a 9% boost in 1976 outlays , but it also concludes that price rises would result in no gain in physical investment . ( See story on page 19 . ) Interviews with economists and executives indicate , however , that the physical amount of expanded or improved productive capacity to be installed next year will be far below the 1974 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost more each year . Also , companies must spend more to satisfy government pollution-control and employe health and safety rules . Finally , it costs more each year just to replace existing facilities , partly because of inflation but also because there is more plant to maintain . Significant Decline This decline in actual additions of plants and better machinery is highly significant . Only new or expanded facilities create new industrial jobs and provide the capacity needed to avert shortages in the next economic boom . Also , the long-term rate of gain in productivity  --  the rise in output per man-hour  --  depends on the amount of moreefficient facilities actually installed , not on the total dollars spent . And rising productivity is essential to a higher standard of living and to keeping U.S. products competitive in world markets . A two-year decline in actual additions to or improvements in productive facilities does n't necessarily mean the U.S. is stagnating , of course . Historically , capital spending has lagged economic trends ; it continues at high levels for a while after the economy turns down , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial production and other economic activities have begun improving . But if executives ' caution about adding plant and equipment continues , it will slow future expansion of the economy . Evidence of that caution abounds . Executive after executive talks about increasing return on investment , generally by minimizing capital outlays and making existing capital work harder . Ford Motor Co. , for example , cut 1975 spending below initial projections by deferring or eliminating some projects . The company now estimates 1975 spending at about $700 million , down from $800 million projected in January and $832 million actually invested in 1974 . Survey of Big Firms The nation 's 1,000 largest manufacturers plan to spend $45.3 billion on plant and equipment in 1976 , down from $48.1 billion this year , according to a survey by the Conference Board , a New York economic research organization . Appropriations for future spending by the companies this year will drop to about $44.7 billion , 21% below 1974 's $56.9 billion , the Conference Board adds . As of July , only 57% of the companies said they will expand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a result of this caution , suppliers of capital goods have seen orders plunge . Producers of machine tools , the machines used to shape practically all parts made of metal , report a 61% decline in orders for the Brst nine months of this year . Companies making other capital goods ranging from heavy trucks to textile machinery also note slack orders . " Industrial plants are running at low capacity , working back from consumer industries all the way to the basic industries such as , steel , " says George Ramsden , vice president , sales , for Jervis B. Webb Co. , Detroit producer of industrial conveyor systems . " As a result , they are n't spending for expansion . " And because of slow business , companies have less cash to invest . Sun Oil Co. , St. Dayids , Pa. , sees 1975 spending " at the very bottom " of the $600 million to $750 million range set last January . That 's down from $834 million in 1974 . The sag reflects in addition to a drop in purchases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings because of lower product demand and a surge in domestic and foreign taxes . Companies also say they are conserving capital because they expect it to be scarcer in the next decade . " Cash generation for expansion has become our No. 1 . priority . " says Richard E. Heckert , senior vice president of Du Pont Co . " In selecting new investments , we face increasingly difficult choices because of cash limitations . New investments are being judged not just on their individual merits , but are also being weighed against alternatives . " The chemical giant expects to keep capital spending about level at about $1 billion a year from 1974 through 1977 . Likewise , TRW Inc. , Cleveland-based producer of automotive , electronic , industrial and aerospace products , plans to hold 1976 spending at approximately this year 's levels because TRW does n't want any more debt . The 1975 spending will be $10 million to $15 million below last year 's $128 million , officials say . Companies holding 1976 capital spending to 1974 levels , of course , will get fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year 's projected 1% increase in current-dollar spending represents an 11.5% drop from 1974 in real capital outlays . Price increases on plant and equipment are likely to be smaller in 1976 but still substantial , probably exceeding 8% . Impact on a Utility To evaluate inflation 's impact on individual companies , consider Commonwealth Edison Co . The Chicago utility is spending about $928 million on a nuclear power station scheduled to start up in 1978 . A similar 2.2-million-kilowatt plant that began producing power in 1973 cost about $618 million . " The cost has gone up just about 50% over the five years , " G. R. Corey , vice chairman , says . Inflation has similarly ballooned prices of replacement equipment , and companies , even when spending cautiously , ca n't avoid replacing worn-out gear . One new roll for a steel rolling mill now costs $13,964 , more than 50% above the $9,153 in 1972 , and rolls are due to go up another 8% soon , says Armco Steel Corp. , Middletown , Ohio . Armco will spend $80 million to $85 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to climb . Complicating analysis of such costs , however , is the generally higher quality of new equipment ; it is usually difficult to separate spending for replacement from that for better efficiency , pollution abatement and employe safety . An auto parts maker might buy a small furnace for melting steel for castings to replace an aging one . But the new equipment probably will be more efficient than the old furnace , produce lesssmoke and have additional safety features . Nevertheless , the proliferation of new laws and arhroinifstrative rulings on safety and pollution control requires sharply increased spending for equipment that does n't appreciably augment capacity or productivity . The Commerce Department estimates that industry will spend $6.29 billion for pollution-abatement equipment in 1975 , up 12% from $5.62 billion in 1974 . However , some other surveys indicate much higher totals . , for example , estimates 1975 corporate capital outlays just for air and water pollution control at $8.35 billion , up 20% from 1974 and more than triple the $2.5 billion spent on such facilities in 1970 . Problems of Analysis " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very difficult thing to segregate , " says Commonwealth Edison 's Mr. Corey , who headed a task force that studied the outlook for electric utilities . " Our projection was that ( electric utility industry ) spending for environmental equipment in the 15 years from 1975 through 1989 will be $30 billion to $60 billion . My own estimate is $60 billion , about 10% of total facilities investment . " About the same percentage applies at Commonwealth Edison , he says , with about $70 million of the $700 million to be invested in both 1975 and 1976 going for pollution controls . Steel industry pollution-control expenditures take an even higher percentage of capital investment . At U.S. Steel Corp. , for instance , they amounted to about 15% last year . And next year Armco Steel and Republic Steel Corp . face a far heavier burden in overhauling their jointly owned taconite ore processing plant at Silver Bay , Minn . Of the planned $252 million outlay , only about $30 million will buy productive equipment ; the rest will be spent to end the dumping of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the air . So far there are n't any outlays of that magnitude for employe health and safety , but such costs also are mounting . For instance , B. F. Goodrich Co. , Akron , is spending $42 million over a four-year period to reduce employe exposure to vinyl chloride ; the gas , used to make plastic resins , is believed to cause liver cancer . And on a much smaller scale , a trucker buying a $40,000 highway tractor this year is paying about $2,000 for additional braking gear to meet new federal requirements for nonskid stops , says White Motor Corp. , a Cleveland truck producer . Long-Range Impact Hazy It 's too early to say whether the combination of corporate investment caution and increased spending for essentially nonproductive equipment will permanently slow down economic growth . Some economists and executives think so . Others think companies will resume investing aggressively after a few quarters of rising sales and profits . The Conference Board figures the 1,000 largest manufacturers will raise their capital appropriations next year and their spending in 1977.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
