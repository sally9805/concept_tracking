Jerusalem 's answer on the West Bank further dims peace prospects <P> After almost two months of standing in the wings , the Middle East is back on the diplomatic stage again . When he visits Jerusalem this week for Israel 's 30th anniversary celebrations , Vice President Walter Mondale will talk with Israeli leaders about how to get the stalled peace negotiations moving once more . After that , he plans to fly on to Alexandria for a meeting with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat . <P> Depending on how Mondale fares , Washington hopes to arrange a July meeting in Europe , probably in London , between Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan and his Egyptian counterpart , Mohammed Ibrahim Kamel . Also attending : U.S. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance . Following that , Vance might soon find himself flying to the Middle East for the fifth time since he took office 17 months ago . <P> What triggered much of this latest activity was Israel 's response to two questions that the Carter Administration put to Dayan during a Washington visit two months ago . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the captured Arab territory in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip : Would Israel be willing to declare that at the end of five years the final status of these areas would be resolved ? And how might this resolution take place ? <P> The government of Premier Menachem Begin took its time in arriving at its answers . When it finally did so last week , it was almost a year to the day after the ailing Polish-born guerrilla fighter and political mystic came to power and seven months following Sadat 's " sacred mission " to Jerusalem . But the passage of time had not changed attitudes . The Israeli government 's response was only a crisp observation that five years after a peace agreement Israel would be willing to negotiate " the nature of future relations " between itself and the West Bank . With that virtual nonanswer , the Begin government signaled once more that it was determined to hold on to the West Bank and Gaza at any price , even at the cost of foreclosing the best opportunity Israel has had to make peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> That was bad news for practically everybody ; even within Israel it was widely criticized . Two of Begin 's 19 Cabinet colleagues abstained from the Knesset vote , and a third , Defense Minister Ezer Weizman , stormed out of the meeting shouting and cursing . The decision , in his view , " will lead us all to another round of wars . I will go and prepare the army for the next war . " The Labor opposition was also sharply critical . " What is the point of giving an answer that nobody will accept ? " demanded Opposition Leader Shimon Peres . " Who needs a decision that by its very nature is a neither-nor reply ? " Added former Premier Yitzhak Rabin : " It is ridiculous that the three main Cabinet members can not agree on a decision like this . "
