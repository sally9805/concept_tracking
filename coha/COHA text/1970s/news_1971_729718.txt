txt Offshore oil fields , as great as or greater than the bonanza discovered in the Persian Gulf , are now a likelihood in the East and South China Seas . " There 's enough oil there for everyone , " says Ur . kennetit Emery , an oceanographer who has been making geophysical studies of the area since World War H. " It could radically change the standard of living for everyone from South Korea to Indonesia , as it has done in the Persian Gulf . " Offshore drilling  --  already an annual $6 billion business providing 20 percent of the world 's oil and gas  --  will account for half of the world 's supply in the next decade or two , Dr. Emery predicts . Offshore production will soon overtake the $7 billion world fishing industry to become the most valuable , recoverable ocean resource , he estimates . Mining for tin , cobalt , magnetite , manganese nodules , diamonds , and other materials is " small potatoes " in comparison , amounting to $15 to $20 million a year . // *Offshore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution , Dr , Emery has just returned from his latest one-month research cruise of the Java Seas . He is also a member of the National Academy of Sciences . The oil potential in the China Seas has been realized only in the last five years , Dr. Emery said in an interview . The oldest producing wells in the area , off Indonesia and Thailand , go back four years . Indonesia 's on- and offshore oil production now has surpassed 1 million barrels a day . Giant to awaken ? No oil is currently being produced commercially in the East China Sea because of political difficulties , he says . But oil-bearing sediments on the Continental Shelf could provide much-needed energy for Japan and South Korea and could help awaken the slumbering giant ? mainland China . " Mainland China 's oil production is only minima at the moment . The economy is still based on muscle power . They have some coal and onshore oil production , but once they have the technology and the energy power , you 'll see an industrial boom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , " said Dr. Emery . The development of a " small-tractor economy " will release millions of Chinese peasants for work in factories , and oil will play a major influence , he foresees . As a point of comparison , U.S. oil con sumption is 20 barrels per person a year ; whereas the agrarian Chinese consume less than 1 percent of that , he calculates . Rights disputed Two years ago , Dr. Emery was part of a survey team that established the oil potential off South Vietnam and Cambodia . Development has been delayed because of territorial disputes between the two countries . But this fall the offshore lands will be subdivided and leases sold to major oil concerns . In yet-to-be publighed findings , Dr. Emery reports that sediments in the deeper China Basin , west of the Philippines and south of mainland China , are different from and older than those on the Continental Shelf . Although the shelf areas still look more favorable for oil exploration , the China Basin has greater potential than anyone realized . " We still do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Someone will have to punch some holes to find out . " Repercussions expected The oil potential of the China Seas has only recently been discovered , Dr. Emery assesses , " because the oil companies are not very venturesome . The jump to offshore production usually occurs after a government or university expedition has shown the potential . " In the long run , production of oil off the Asian coast is likely to have repercussions elsewhere around the world . " This will apply pressure particularly to the Middle East countries . They wo n't be able to keep jacking up the price of oil because of the Asian competition . If they price themselves out of business , they 'll be in trouble . " The development of offshore drilling has been astonishingly rapid , Dr. Emery points out . Before World War II , the technology was n't available . By- 1950 , only 1 to 2 percent of the oil came from offshore sources . Today it 's 20 percent .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
