Revolt of the Old <P> To the Editors : <P> <P> Revolt of the Old Oct. 10-you better believe it ! I used TIME 'S story to present the pros and cons of Claude Pepper 's bill to my nursing home 's " Keeping Current " group . They demolished the cons . <P> One nursing-home patient summed it up : " If we had worked longer , we would have been able to buy more and thus create more jobs . To mandate the retirement of the able , experienced older worker is like burning all the encyclopedias in the world . " <P> <P> Blanche Levy <P> Milwaukee <P> Why not " revolt of the aged , " as in fine wine and good cheese-instead of " old " as in newspapers and shoes . <P> <P> Patricia Ann Roczey <P> San Diego <P> It is usually overlooked that for a retired person , a new life begins : a new life with new opportunities and new challenges . So-called love for the job and the position one holds is frequently nothing but a mask to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 65 is like the quality of mercy : it blesses him who retires and it blesses the unemployed for whom the gates to a productive life are finally opened . <P> <P> Fred S. Mott <P> Cincinnati <P> The proposal to raise to 70 the age at which a person can get a maximum Social Security check was made by the desk set , whose hardest job is making it to the water cooler and back to their desks . They can " work " until 98 before throwing in the towel . <P> At 62 my back finally caved in , and the doctor said any man who works 46 years in a mine , mill or construction job , as I have , deserves a rest . So I retired on 80% Social Security and a small carpenter 's pension . Millions of Americans work very hard for their money and are glad to retire at 65 or earlier . <P> <P> Chester Degenkolb <P> Pittsburgh <P> Where are all these jobs that people want to work at till the day they die ? And where are all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die on the job ? <P> In all my years I 've met only two neurotics who waited to be shoved out at 65 . ( They should have been kicked out at 20 . ) <P> If there are these wonderful jobs around , then why not give minorities a chance at them ? <P> <P> J.M. Hermerl <P> Chippewa Falls , Wis . <P> <P> What the hell good does it do to have a retirement age of 70 if you ca n't get a job after 50 ? <P> <P> Dorothy Quincey <P> Los Angeles <P> Kicked out of the California educational system at 65 , I was hired by Western Illinois University ( half time at my request ) to start a remedial English program . The program is now flourishing , and I have just published a textbook ( The Least You Should Know About English ) that has sold 27,000 copies in its first eight months . <P> <P> Teresa Ferster <P> Glazier Macomb , Ill . <P> <P> I for one am glad Winston Churchill was around at 65 to pull our civilization out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mass . <P> Fish-and-Chips in Soho <P> If Freddie Laker 's air fares to London Oct. 10 are still in existence come next summer , it will be fish-and-chips in Soho instead of squid in San Francisco for me . <P> Jolly good show , Freddie ! <P> <P> Barbara Cavagnaro <P> Manhasset , N. Y. <P>
