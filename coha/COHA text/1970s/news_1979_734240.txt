txt JACKIE ? ROGERS tried every trick . She did n't miss a one , but none of them worked . She kept right on smoking . She puffed up a storm , cigaret after cigaret , pack after pack , year after year . Every night as she went to bed she vowed to quit smoking the next morning . And yet the next morning would come and she 'd grab for the pack lying on the table next to the bed . She always had a new scheme concocted just to escape the menacing looks she got from her husband and children ? . the looks of disappointment and disdain as she would nervously light up another one . " I tried everything , " she , says . " I smoked for 20 years and was on a 20-year quitting.binge . Close-up With Anne Keegan " I tried plastic pacifiers that looked like cigarets and would suck on them . I tried throat lozenges and chewed on them in between cigarets , I threw countless packs into the wastepaper basket and vowed never to smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rummaging through the basket , retrieving the pack . I ' tried hypnotists. and they did n't work . " When my mother got sick with cancer I promised to quit smoking forever if she lived . But I never lived up to that promise . " I WENT TO meetings where they showed me what happens to your lungs , and still I kept puffing away . I even gave up buying them . Then I had to live by plot and ploy . Every day I went to visit friends who either smoked or kept cigarets out on their coffee tables and I would sneak a few home with me in my purse . " I went to a psychiatrist twice a week to see why I was smoking . I did n't know the psychiatrist was a smoker himself and after many visits he told me my problem was not cigarets but my husband , who did not approve of them . He wanted to talk to my husband next . When I told my husband that , he just about hit the roof . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's it , ' I said to myself . ' I 've got lung cancer and am going to die . ' I vowed ! Vowed on everything holy as I was carted away to the hospital that if it was n't lung cancer I would give up smoking for good . " It turned out not to be lung cancer but pneumonia , and I did n't smoke while I was in the hospital or when I first came home . But then I went down into our basement , into my studio , and there was a pack of cigarets lying there . " IT WAS LIKE the devil sitting there and I ran upstairs to get away from them . But I kept thinking about that // Tribune Photo by David Nystrom Jackie Rogers : " I tried plastic pacifiers . " She stubs out her cigaret for good // pack of cigarets . And finally I decided I would have one , only one , after lunch . " I had that one and I felt real proud of myself . I thought , ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' But the next morning , when I got up , the first thing I thought of was , ' When will I have that one cigaret ? ' And after supper that night I crept down and had one more . And the next morning all I could think of was , ' When am I going to have my two cigarets ? ' " The compulsion had taken over again . I 'd opened the floodgates , and the compulsion to smoke had flooded me under . " My husband and my four children did not approve of my smoking at all , and I could not do it in front of them . It got so when my husband came home from work  --  which used to be the nicest time of day  --  instead of thinking , ' Oh wonderful , John is home , ' I 'd think , ' Oh God , where can I go now to smoke ? ' And I would retreat to the basement or say I had to go shopping to get away from him so I could puff away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this man , yet I 'm preferring cigarets to the man I love ; What has happened to me ? ' By this time , I 'd lost respect for myself . I had no will power at all . " The kids would say , ' Mommy , why are you smoking and killing yourself ? ' and I would say , ' Let your mother alone . I 'm imperfect and smoking is one of my imperfections . Let your mommy lead her own life . ' " By the time Jackie Rogers hit 40 , she 'd been smoking for 20 years , and vowing to quit every day of those 20 years . Yet she never did ; she really did n't want to . She could n't imagine life without a cigaret in her hand . Close-up Finally , her frustrated husband came to her with a deal . The kids , all four of them , would do all the housework  --  the shopping , the cleaning , the laundry , and . the cooking ? if she would please just agree to research the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term paper . " He told me , ' I 'm resigned to your smoking now , but I do not know what I 'm supposed to say to the kids when they haul you out of here for the last time on a stretcher and the kids ask me why I did n't stop Mommy from smoking . ' " I TOLD HIM I would agree to research and study the quitting of smoking as long as I could smoke while I was doing it . The deal was on . " For eight months Jackie researched every aspect of smoking , taking copious notes and puffing away as she did it . The children did her housework and her husband encouraged her studies . " What I was looking for was not just quitting smoking , " she says , " but how to be free from the compulsion to smoke . " As I studied I found that quitting in the past all those times was like trying to cut the trans-Atlantic cable with a pair of manicure scissors , instead of untwisting it wire by wire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole thing . " Finally , after almost a year 's study , Jackie Rogers , hardcore smoker , set a date six weeks away . She started to wean herself in different ways away from cigarets , like making the time between the first cup of coffee and the first cigaret longer and longer . On Jan. 31 , 1968 , before she went to bed , Jackie had her last cigaret . " I WOKE DP the next morning wondering what I was going to do . Was I going to make it ? I felt strange , for I had no craving . I felt like I 'd stepped out of myself and into a spring day . The whole day was beautiful and so was the next . And I 've never had another cigaret since . " Jackie Rogers was so exhilarated with her success , she put an ad in the local paper in Easton , Pa. , saying she was conducting a no-smoking seminar at a downtown hotel . Twenty-five people showed up , and of those 25. all hut one eventually gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more seminars and built the organization into a business called Smokenders . She says ' she thinks in the last II years since she stopped puffing her method has cured 150,000 people of the smoking habit , among them Joseph Califano , secretary of the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare , who has come out strongly against smoking ; Barry Manilow ; and Lauren Bacall . One of her groups out West , she says , is trying to cure one of the " Marlboro men " models of the habit . AND JACKIE is delighted . " My life has changed , " she says , " since I gave up cigarets . I feel more reassured now , I 've finally done something on my own . I 've become more assertive . I 'd failed so many times before and I finally did something spectacular . " I wake up with more energy and I do n't lose it anymore during the day . I 've mastered something that mastered me . But most of all , I found freedom . And is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something as little and unimportant as a ciagret ? "
