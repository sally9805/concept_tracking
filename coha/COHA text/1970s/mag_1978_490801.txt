THE A k ? . NEW 1101iN IH THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment THE global fortunes of liberty are difficult to measure , but it seems undeniable that in the last five years or so they have shown a definite improvement . At least four nations  --  Greece , Portugal , Spain , and India  --  have made the notoriously difficult transition from dictatorship to constitutional government . In the same period , our own country cast a resounding vote in favor of liberty by ejecting President Nixon from office when he began to trifle with our Constitution . Subsequently , our government adopted the advancement of human rights as an explicit purpose of its foreign policy . No parallel improvement has been visible in the Soviet Union  --  on the contrary , the Soviet government has recently cracked down on the human-rights movement there  --  yet one ex-citizen of that country , Alexander Solzhenitsyn , has carried out a virtual one-man revolution in world opinion on the question of Soviet repression . He has brought to light truths about Soviet history which no amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . One surprising thing about the new democratic trend is that it does not seem to have been inspired by an ideological commitment to democracy . Rather , the parties involved have often seemed to slide in the direction of democracy almost in spite of themselves . In Portugal , for example , some months after the dictatorship of Mar-cello Caetann was overthrown , General Anttinio de Spinola , the leader of the revolt , and a man of the right , tried to seize power in a coup d'etat , but the attempt was stopped by other elements of the Army . Several months later , a political faction on the far left , claiming allegiance to Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho , the commander of an Army security force , launched another coup , but this attempt , too , was turned hack . Only then did the country settle down and submit itself to the results of a general election  --  an election that gave no single party a majority , let alone dictatorial control . The Portuguese , it seemed , had become democrats by default . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original revolution might have wished to exercise one-party contu of one kind or another . But although they might not have been eager to live merely as one party among many , still less did any of them wish to he stamped out by the one-party rule of some other party . Only when the factions had given up the grand and exciting visions of their original design were they willing to accept parliamentary roles based on their thirty or ten or five per cent of the popular vote . Democracy was everyone 's second choice . Allegiance to diversity became the cost of survival , Similarly , when Franco died in Spain , the Spanish parties , many of which might have preferred to exercise eNclusive control over a new government , whether as monarchists or as Communists , found a common ground in parliamentary procedure , and democracy emerged more as a way of accommodating the conflicting visions of many parties than as the special enthusiasm of any one party . In the meantime , the same logic was prevailing among the Communist parties of the European nations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliged to make pledges of loyalty to " bourgeois freedoms " if they were to have any hope of gaining admission to full participation in the political lives of their countries . None of these developments would Ii ave more than a local significance if it were not that in the international arena the nations of the world now find themselves in a position very much like that of a collection of political parties setting out to found a new political order . The need arises because blind but irreversible events , unplanned and unanticipated by anyone , have placed an agenda of common business in ev-eryone 's hands  --  business that includes the much-discussed tasks of saving the earth 's ecosphere from despoliation , husbanding the earth 's resources , pre-venting a large-scale collapse of the world economy , and preventing a nuclear holocaust . The substantive issues of a world politics have appeared , but not the mechanisms for dealing with them . Nothing in this situation neces-sarily propels the world toward demo-cratic procedures  --  force and the threat of force still hold their usual sway over international affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-gether , and no one of them has the power to force all the others into com-pliance , however much it might like to , democratic procedures do seem al-most to recommend themselves , as they did in Portugal and Spain . Already , the skills of democratic discourse can pro-vide aleader with formidable advan-tages in international affairs . e Politicians today are busy seeking constituencies out-side the borders of their own countries . Making use of world television , they have taken to speaking over the heads of foreign governments , and addressing foreign peo-ples directly . Anyone who doubts whether this sort of politicking can be effective should reflect on the enor-mous shifts in public opinion which were brought about in the United States , among other places , by President Sadat 's speech in Jerusa-lem . Has any 117nerican politician made such a strong impression on the Ameri-can public in the last year ? Every na-tional leader , therefore , now faces two audiences : the one at home and the one in the world at large . Although the home audiences may be under govern-ment control , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lead-ers of authoritarian nations set out to make their mark on world opinion , they quickly discover that the people of the world at large have to he treated quite differently from the people at home . When they face their own people , they find a cowed , submissive audience , which must accept what they say , because no one in it is allowed to talk back ; but when they turn outward to the world , and seek to make their words carry across international barriers , as the leaders of the Middle Eastern nations are now assiduously doing , they find an audience that is uncoerced  --  or uncoerced by them , at any rate . For each person in the world looks upon every government in the world but his own from the vantage point of a free man  --  free , that is , within the constraints imposed by his own government . And every leader in the world appears before every people but his own in the role of a supplicant and petitioner . In this discourse , the authoritarian manner  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people than they know themselves , together with the assumption that to disagree is disloyal and probably punishable  --  is not likely to go over well . Dictatorial leaders who want to address the world persuasively have to accord their new audience a respect that they may altogether deny their own people . A small incident that occurred during President Carter 's recent trip shows how the process works : when the President was in Poland , Edward Gierek , the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish Communist Party and de-facto head of the Polish government , who has recently been seeking to increase Poland 's international prestige , judged it worthwhile to invite several American newsmen to interview him on television ; and it was a courtesy that he showed to the foreign audience alone . Gierek found it advisable to give American viewers better treatment than he gives his own coutrymen . Naturally , a government is free to turn its back on the world audience , and simply bombard it with the propaganda that was styled for domestic use , as the Chinese are notable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully into world affairs as they are constituted today finds that it has to adopt the style , and perhaps a little of the substance , of democratic politics . ? Two Concerts BACK To BACH : Three-fifteen on a midwinter Saturday afternoonah , bitter chill it was , the owl ... But what was going on at the Symphony Theatre , on Broadway at Ninety-fifth Street ? Dulcet woodwinds . A dozen rows of seats removed at the front , to accommodate the American Symphony Orchestra and a gaggle of amateur musicians who were attempting Bach 's Fourth Brandenburg Concerto . Swaying and bobbing , the woodwind cluster navigated the closing bars , a little raggedly but with spirit . " You got there ! " shouted Allan Miller as the overflow audience broke into applause . " You did it ! " Allan Miller is the conductor for special programs of the American Symphony , and its twelve-hour ( 11 A.M. to I I P.M. ) , admission-free , play-along " Wall to Wall Bach " festival was going better than anyone had imagined in his wildest dreams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the line of people waiting to get in stretched far along Broadway . About thirty amateur instrumentalists , each of whom had brought an instrument , a music stand , and a burning desire to perform in public , were sitting in with the American Symphony 's regulars , while as many more were waiting their turn in a section of seats reserved for them at the front of the house . The amateurs had begun signing in as early as nine-thirty in the morning , and some of the luckiest had had the unforgettable experience of performing alongside Jaime Laredo , Lilian Kallir , Pinchas and Eugenia Zukerman , Walter Trampler , and other famous guest virtuosos . " It 's the best concert I 've ever been to , " said Marie Miller , Allan 's wife , who is a small , dark-haired woman . She had a " Back to Bach " button pinned to her dress . " Look at that audience ! Everyone wide awake ! " The next piece on the program was Bach 's Concerto in D Minor , performed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not conducting this one , we were able to talk with him for a few minutes , while he consumed a hamburger in an impromptu greenroom to the left of the stage . A slim , youthful-looking man in a dark-blue blazer and a purple turtleneck , Miller seemed preternaturally calm . " People keep asking me , ' When are the amateurs coming ? ' " he said . " But thirty out of the fifty musicians playing in there are amateurs . It 's all going very smoothly . And we 've had some wonderful mu sical moments , too . One young man his name is Philip Rubinstein  --  came nut of the audience with his violin and said he 'd like to play the Bach Double Concerto . It was n't on the program , or anything , but Robert Rucli6 , our concertmaster , said he 'd be glad to do it with him , and Elaine Comparone , who has donated her harpsichord and her services on it for the entire day , accompanied them . I thought they handled it superbly . " Inviting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done before , but never , he told us , on a scale as big as this . Part of his job with the American Symphony Orchestra  --  an innovative young orchestra that was founded in 1962 by Leopold Stokowski and is now entirely self-governing ( the musicians decide all major questions by vote ) ? is to develop new audiences and new performing opportunities throughout the city ; and the upper West Side , which is where the Millers , most of the day 's soloists , and a host of other serious musicians live , seemed the natural place for a pioneer Bach marathon . Why Bach ? Because his music is fairly accessible to sight-reading amateurs , Miller said , and also because , as a Brooklyn violinist had told him over the phone the day before , " there are a Jot of Bach-lovers in this town . " Planning for the event started last June , when Miller teamed up with a next-door neighbor , Ethel Sheffer , who runs a neighborhood-improvement group called Blocks for a Better Broadway . Mrs. Sheffer mustered local support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miller handled the musical and organizational end of things , taking care of outside fund-raising and publicity , and persuading the soloists to lend their talents . Three days before the concert , when it suddenly became evident that the ancient and semi-moribund old movie theatre had not been cleaned for aeons , Mrs. Sheffer got Project Return , a local drug rehabilitation clinic , to send over four volunteers ; she wangled brooms from the Sanitation Department and a vacuum cleaner from the OTB office down the street ; and Miller and the volunteers spent five hours battling the dirt . What the old-rose interior lacked in splendor it was now making up in ambiente . A lot of people in the audience looked absurdly happy . When a flutist , arriving late , found thatthere were no chairs left in the flute section , he was instantly provided with a briefcase to sit on . Periodically , after conducting a work , Miller would suggest to the audi- " Hard to believe , is n't it ? Saper Bowl XII now belongs to the ages . " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the people waiting outside hear some music , and large numbers would graciously give up their seats . " It 's really an incredible day , " said Mrs. Sheffer , to whom Miller had introduced us . " The policeman on duty in the lobby just got relieved , but he says he 's going to stay . A lot of people are making contributions to the Arnerican Symphony , which is lucky , because we went into this without having all the money to pay for it . You should have seen a woman who just gave us five dollars . She had tears streaming down her cheeks , and she said it was the happiest day of her life ? I 've never played with an orchestra before , and today I made my d6but with Pinchas Zukerman ! ' " Miraculously , the long and complex program was running almost precisely on schedule . We stayed for the Concerto for Oboe d'Amore and Orelkstra ( Marsha Heller , soloist ) , and for the Suite for Orchestra No. l , during which Miller stopped the musicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you " to the violins , and looked pleased after they resumed playing . We had to leave then , but we returned a little after eight , when the Mass in B Minor was scheduled to begin . There was a lot of milling in the aisles as about a hundred and fifty singers received scores and took up positions behind the orchestra and up on the stage . " Please make way for a cello , " someone was saying . " Cello coming through . " Isaiah Sheffer , Ethel 's husband , stood beside Miller on the podium ( a wooden box covered with a rug ) . " Please he quiet , " he implored all those present , " so we can organize this titanic event . " From where we stood , the soprano section appeared to he dominated by lovely young girls with long , cascading hair ; the alto section by lovely mature women , some with snow-white hair ; and the tenor and bass sections by lovely men of about thirty-two , some with no hair . A CBS television cameraman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day had his lens and floodlight about a foot from Miller 's face at this point . Miller 's calmness  --  the sheer nerve of the man struck us as super-human . He was in the position of a general whose army may be going into 22 JANUARY 2 3 9 1 97 8 battle without ammunition , and he did not ilinch . Turning to the audience , Miller thanked it for its wonderful caperation throughout the day . " Thank you , Allan ! " someone called out , to cheering and applause . Addressing the chorus , Miller said , " Could I have a B-minor chord ? " We held our breath . The chorus responded with a soft but very creditable B-minor chord . Miller smiled and nodded . " I think that will he fine , " he said quietly . A moment later , they were into it . Two hours and forty minutes later , they were really into it , filling the theatre ( which was still packed ) with glorious sound . Six concert artists were on hand to handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star . The chorus seemed to gain strength and confidence as the Mass progressed . During the final movement , any number of moist eyes caught the light on the stage and in the audience , and the applause at the end must have registered on most of the area 's seismographs . A tsunami of applause . Clapping in unison . Bravos and bravissimos . Allan Miller saluting the orchestra , the soloists , and the chorus . The chorus applauding Allan Miller . Allan Miller saluting the audience , and the audience saluting everybody else . A great day for Bach ; a great day for the American Symphony Orchestra ; a great day for the upper West Side . ? HOROWITZ GALA : What will probably prove to he the most dramatic musical event of 1978 took place at Carnegie Hall the other Sunday when Vladimir Horowitz , that eccentric , nonpareil pianist , played a concerto with an orchestra for the first time in twenty-five years . The orchestra was the New York Philharmonic ( the concert marked the fiftieth anniversary of Mr. Horowitz 's Philharmonic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the conductor was Eugene Ormandy , the celebrated seventy-eightyear-old conductor and music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra . This was a benefit concert for the Philhar mottle , with everybody donating his or her services , and Mr. Horowitz had taken on the role of impresario as well as that of soloist . He had selected the time ( 4 P.m. ) , the place ( Carnegie Hall ) , the orchestra itself ( the Philharmonic ) , the piano ( a 1973 Steinway with a large and brilliant sound ) , the recording company ( RCA ) , and the conductor ( Ormandy ) , creating a certain amount of confusion in the process . ( The Philharmonic normally plays in Avery Fisher Hall and records for Columbia . Mr. Ormandy had n't conducted the orchestra in many years . ) There were two rehearsals of the program , and we were invited to the second one , which took place at 5 P.M. on the Friday before the performance . It began with a spirited reading of Beethoven 's " Egmont Overture " by Mr. Ormandy , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baton technique . At five-twelve , Mr. Horowitz , wearing a brown suit , a pale-yellow shirt , and a yellow-and-white bow tie , walked up to the podium and leafed through several pages of the concerto with Mr. Ormandy . Then , as Mr. Ormandy asked the musicians to mark certain passages ( " After Two he wants it a bit more pianissimo .... Before Fifteen , a heavier weight for the basses " ) , Mr. Horowitz sat down at the piano and provided musical illustrations . When everything had been marked , Mr. Ormandy turned to his soloist and said , " Shall we begin ? " Winds and strings played a light , pulsating motif , and after a few bars Mr. Horowitz joined them with a melancholy Slavic theme . The concerto progressed through a series of rippling arpeggios , a playful dialogue between piano and orchestra , and a percussive cadenza , with pauses every few minutes for consultation and adjustment . At one point , after the orchestra and the piano had played a powerful fortissimo passage together , Mr. Horowitz turned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Could you hear me ? " " Just , " replied Mr. Friend with a straight face . During the great cadenzas , the musicians sat very still , watching Mr. Horowitz as if he were a genie who had suddenly materialized out of a bottle . During several purely orchestral passages , Mr. Horowitz swung around to straddle the piano bench and encourage the strings with discreet bowing motions . At the end of the second movement , soloist and orchestra played two rapid percussive chords . THE NEW YORKER After the second one , Mr. Ormandy signalled the orchestra to halt , taking Mr. Horowitz by surprise with his hands poised clawlike over the keyboard . " Shall we stop ? " Mr. Ormandy said politely , pointing to his watch . " They need a break . " Mr. Horowitz nodded , and jumped up from the bench . He looked at the ceiling , and then pushed his piano a few inches farther into the center of the orchestra . " The more it goes inside , the better it sounds , " he said as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I play my recital , I sit where the oboe is , because there is more projection . " During the break , we asked Mr. Ormandy exactly when he had last conducted the Philharmonic . ' Thirty years ago , in New Orleans , " he said . " IVIr . Rodzinski suddenly resigned just before a southern tour , and Stokowski and I divided a week between us . " " Tell us about the Rachmaninoff concerto , " we said . " Rachmaninoff was a good friend of mine and of our orchestra , and a great artist , and he was always very modest about his work , " said Mr. Ormandy . " He made several small cuts in the Third , perhaps because he thought it might be too long to hold the audience 's attention . Actually , it runs forty minutes at the most , which is pretty close to normal . When I talked to Horowitz about the concerto , I told him I had several scores of it with different sets of cuts . And he said , ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' So we got a new copy for the orchestra and started from scratch . " At the end of the rehearsal , we found Mr. Horowitz  --  lean , elegant , and vigorous-looking at seventy-four  --  relaxing in his shirtsleeves in an upstairs dressing room . " For my age , I did n't play badly , " he said , lighting a cigarette . We asked why he had chosen the Rachmaninoff Third . " I suppose it 's my favorite concerto , because it embraces everything that is possible pianistically , " he said . " But I also like the First very much , and perhaps I 'll play that , too , someday . I 've recorded the Third twice , and I always play the original cadenza that Rachmaninoff wrote for the end of the first movement . The alternate cadenza is so strong it 's ton much Like an ending in the middle of the concerto . " " Why did you restore the cuts ? " we asked . " When Rachmaninoff played the concerto first , in 1909 , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He was very much offended , and he tried to shorten the piece to make it more popular , I had played the concerto for several years in Europe , and Rachmaninoff heard about me from Fritz Kreisler . One day shortly after I arrived here , in 1928 , I got a call from the Steinways . ' Mr. Rachmaninoff would like Mr. Horowitz to come down and play his concerto . ' We met , and went downstairs together to the basement . He played the orchestra part on one piano while I played the solo part on the other one . He made a lot of small cuts , which I used for many years . Until today . " " How would you describe your interpretation of this music ? " we asked . " I play freely in the grand mariner , " said Mr. Horowitz . " And the Philharmonic is not really accustomed to this style . As we all know , music is made up of little black notes on white paper that you read . But I always say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search for it , and that is what I mean by the grand manner . I play , so to speak , from the other side of the printed score , looking hack . " The concert , which took place two days later , was an enormous success . Carnegie Hall was packed with Horowitz buffs , Philharmonic patrons , and curious musicians , most of whom had never heard the Master perform with an orchestra . " Hearing him play is a rare and sensational experience , " said the Metropolitan Opera 's music director , James Levine , who is no mean pianist himself . " Horowitz is one of a handful of artists who can project and communicate with such size and thrust of personality that you are swept along beyond your power to criticize . " There was a message from President Carter before the concerto began ( " Your world-acclaimed talent and consistent generosity in sharing it have made all of us proud that you are an American " ) , and a ten-minute standing ovation at the end . We dashed backstage during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congratulations from a circle of friends . " Was it good ? " asked Mr. Horo-
