Dr. Lewis Thomas has more good news about the human condition <P> <P> There is nothing at all absurd about the human condition . We matter . It seems to me a good guess , hazarded by a good many people who have thought of it , that we may be engaged in the formation of something like a mind for the life of this planet . If this is so , we are still at the most primitive stage , still fumbling with language and thinking , but infinitely capacitated for the future . Looked at this way , it is remarkable that we 've come as far as we have in so short a period , really no time at all as geologists measure time . We are the newest , the youngest , and the brightest things around . <P> - Lewis Thomas <P> <P> Who is this man , and why is he saying all those nice things about the human race ? The first question is simpler than the second . Lewis Thomas , 65 , is a doctor and an administrator ( currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center in New York City ) . He is a biologist , a researcher and a professor . He is a published poet and , quite possibly , the best essayist on science now working anywhere in the world . <P> This last accomplishment has brought Thomas more attention than all the others put together . A collection of 29 of his essays was published in 1974 under the title The Lives of a Cell : Notes of a Biology Watcher . No one expected much , least of all the author . For one thing , most Americans escape from the study of biology as fast as their teachers will let them ; if they think of the subject at all , they are likely to remember rubbery dead frogs and the smell of formaldehyde . For another , Thomas made few concessions to the ignorance of laymen . He certainly did not obfuscate , but he gave complex matters the taxonomic precision they required : " It has been proposed that symbiotic linkages between prokaryotic cells were the origin of eukaryotes , and that fusion between different sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phagocytic ones ) . . . " Such is not the stuff that bestsellers are made of , but that is precisely what Thomas ' book became . Novelist Joyce Carol Gates found the essays " remarkable . . . undogmatic . . . gently persuasive . " John Updike praised Thomas ' " shimmering vision . " Reviewers picked up the applause ; so did more and more readers . The book has now sold over 300,000 copies in hardback and paperback and has been translated into eleven languages . The Lives of a Cell was given a National Book Award in April 1975 , but not in the category of science . It was honored as a contribution to the field of arts and letters . <P> Which is what it was . And so is The Medusa and the Snail ( Viking ; 175 pages ; $8.95 ) , a collection of 29 more Thomas essays to be published this month . If anything , the new book is better than its predecessor . Thomas ' prose seems firmer , his conclusions surer , his voice more resonant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and devotes his attention to larger chunks of society as well as to bacteria and viruses . Taken together , his two books form an extended paean to this , the best of all possible worlds .
