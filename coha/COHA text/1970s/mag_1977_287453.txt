" His message struck a special chord in me , " said Los Angeles Correspondent William Marmon , whose long interview with Alex Haley , the author of Roots , accompanies our cover story . Marmon , whose own roots were in the South , finds that he too has " rattling around in my head some near-biblical family stories told and retold by my grandmother . " Like many white Southerners , Marmon chafed against the " distorting experience " of segregation and , to help counteract it , wrote his senior thesis at Princeton on the Harlem renaissance of the 1920s . Correspondent Edward Boyer , who sat in on the interview with Haley , felt a shock of recognition when he saw Roots on TV . Boyer 's maternal grandparents were born slaves , and his grandfather had watched General Sherman 's troops march through Georgia - marveling , as any nine-year-old boy would , at " all the shiny buttons " on the blue Union uniforms . <P> The bad weather continued to be major news this week , and in some parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff . When New York Correspondent Marion Knox was assigned to cover the chilly plight of snowbound Buffalo ( see THE NATION ) , she found that trains had stopped running , all highways were shut down , and no flights were landing at the Buffalo airport .

From there she hopped a truck carrying 35,000 lbs . of frozen veal , part of a two-mile-long caravan taking emergency rations to the stricken city . " Buffalo was a mess , " she reports-streets unplowed , cars buried in snow , people carting groceries home on sleds . " The very fact of being there made you part of the people . ' You stuck here too ? ' someone would ask , and he 'd start right out telling you his story . " <P> We heard an interesting story from Iowa , a follow-up to our Jan. 31 cover on the Big Freeze . The Saturday night after that issue came out , Gordon Neal , at home on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The caller : President Jimmy Carter , who had been reading TIME and had seen our reference to the Neals ' frozen water pipe . The two chatted about the fuel crisis , Neal 's 160-acre farm and the weather . It turned out that Neal 's pipe had burst and been repaired . He had , in fact , been in the bathtub when his wife called him to the phone . Said Neal last week : " I told Emma that if that ever happened again , she had better tell me who was on the line .
