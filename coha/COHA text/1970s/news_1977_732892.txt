txt The mounting interest in who will now head the Federal Bureau of Investigation obscures a prior question : What should rule the F.B.I. ? Just how committed is the new Administration to impressing the framework of law on an institution that has for years been placed beyond the reach of the law by Presidents , by Congress and by the founding director , J. Edgar Hoover . That is not to say tnat retaining the present curector , Clarence M. Kelley , would signal a commitment to the abuses of the past ; or that Mr. Kelley has been a party to those abuses ; or even that he has condoned them . Far from it . Mr. Kelley has served as a useful bridge between the F.Bl. ' s sordid past and a yet-to-be-determined future . In the wake of the Hoover era and L. Patrick Gray 's brief and confused tenure , Mr. Kelley brought an aura of earnest professionalism . But unfortunately , Mr. Kelley also bore the heavy baggage of having been a long-time Hoover-era employee of the F.B.I . Mr. Kelley is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the memories and loyalties of the past still make on him . Thus , when he began to institute constructive reforms  --  and he did  --  he had to deal with a formidable backlash from within his own agency , generated by employees who saw nothing but virtue in the good old days . And why not ? The bugging , the tapping , the burglarizing , the dissemination of fabricated and defamatory information and the instigations to violence all seemed legitimate . They flowed from Presidential and Congressional imperatives  --  whether explicit , in such Presidential directives as those targeting Nazi saboteurs or the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party , or implicit , as in Congress 's reluctance to question anything the bureau did . In such an atmosphere , it was possible , as the bureau 's former domestic intelligence chief , William C. Sullivan , has testified , for the law to be extraneous to the bureau 's internal decision making . " Never once , " Sullivan told a Senate committee , " did I hear anybody , including myself , raise the question , ' Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is it legal , is it ethical or , moral ? : " And that is what the new F.B.I . appointment must be about . It must be a clear signal that the past is over , that lawlessness is over . Mr. Kelley is , unfortunately , part of the past  --  the best part , perhaps , but still the past . He has trouble , as he himself has admitted , interpreting the F.B.I . to the outside world and is having a similarly difficult time in communicating the need for thoroughgoing reform to his colleagues inside . The new Administration needs to send the clearest signal down through the bureau , out through the country and up to the Congress : that the bad old days are over , that Presidential complicity in lawlessness is over , and that the new Administration will not only welcome but will help fashion new legislation setting lawful limits on the activities of the bureau  --  and other Federal investigative agencies . The appointment of a person of stature who is deeply committed to the law is the immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the long range the nation will have to depend on that framework of law for the preservation of democratic values . In its rough outline , that legislation should at least include a definition of the F.B.I . ' s jurisdiction , confining it to narrower and substantially more tangible threats to the national security . It should delimit the techniques used by the bureau , forbidding those like burglary , which are clearly illegal , and requiring safeguards  --  like warrants for wiretaps  --  for those which have the potential to be abused . And it should provide for citizens to recover damages for unconstitutional governmental abuses of their rights . How close the nation comes to achieving such safeguards will depend in part on the legislative acumen and leadership of the next director . In its approach to the F.B.I. , our Government went a long , way down the road in the wrong direction and the appointment will suggest just how far back up that road the Carter Administration intends to bring us . Our character as a people derives from our determination to govern ourselves by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or men .
