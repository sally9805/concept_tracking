txt THERE ARE AS many rats in Chicago as there are people  --  about 3.3 million . Applying the same widely accepted rule  --  otthumb ratio , it follows that another 3.6 million rats live in the suburbs . If you are on the ground floor of a building at this moment , at least one rat is probably within 150 feet of you . Hidden , of course . Nonsense , you say ? Well , sorry about all this , but it 's true . Just ask any of the federal , state , municipal , or privately employed experts who earn their living by hunting and killing rats . IN the CHICAGO metropolitan area , about 1,500 men go forth each day on these searchand  --  destroy missions . Laden with chemical killers , baits , poison gas injectors , and a variety of mechanical traps , they travel to opulent North Shore estates , slum apartments , alleys , restaurants , hotels , schools , hospitals , airports , factories , skyscrapers , warehouses , colleges ; theaters , and well , everywhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps they always will be . Man provides them with their three necessities ? food , water , and shelter . The notion that rats exist only in filthy environments is pure myth . You ? rarely see members of the long-tailed armies which infest urban and rural areas across the United States because the rat is nocturnal and prefers invisibility . But the damage he does is enormous . Each year , rats cat or spoil more than $1 billion worth of food in this country . ' THE RAT 'S greatest infamy , of course , is as the carrier of a flea which in turn carries the plague bacilli . In the 14th century , the plague killed 45 million Europeans . The disease then declined rapidly and is relatively rare today . In the United States , it has claimed fewer than 400 lives in the last 75 years . But rats continue to infect humans with other diseases , including typhus fever ; hemorrhagic jaundice , which kills up to 9B per cent of its victims ; and rat bite fever , a serious affliction fortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer salmonellosls , an intestinal disorder , should you eat rat-contaminated food , and trichinosis , if , you consume undercooked pork which came from a. hog whose diet included rats . RATS HAVE BEEN known to start calamitous fires by dragging combustibles into their nests and by gnawing at electric wires . On occasion , they attack babies in their cribs , sometimes fatally . Probably the most despised of all mammals , the rat is also the most varied genus . He comes in more than 500 named forms and under at least one pseudonym , " nutria , " which is the fur trade 's euphemism for rat pelts made into'women 's coats . In Chicago and most of the nation , the Norway rat ? Rattus noryegicus ? dominates . His fur may be brown , ' gray , white , or spotted . He weighs in at about a pound and is 7 to 10 inches long not counting the tail , which doubles his length . The females produce litters of 6 to 22 about once every two months . The young become ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and possessed of exquisitely developed senses of hearing and touch , the rat is one of nature 's most successful biological organisms . " YOU CA N'T exterminate the whole rat population , you can only control it , " said Richard Jennings , vice president of one of Chicago 's biggest pest control firms . Jennings ' company not long ago took on its most unusual hunting job in recent years . It trapped and killed a solitary rat which was terrorizing a secretary on an upper floor of one of Chicago 's newest and tallest skyscrapers  --  but not before it was widely rumored around the Loop that the entire building was swarming with rodents . " You often find rats on construction jobs , but this was really a strange one , " Jennings said . " The rat had obviously been finding bits of food and water somewhere , and hiding out for a long time . " It is true , Jennings said , that rats will chew off their own legs to escape a trap ; that they become cannibalistic when food is scarce ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-organized colonies and fight to retain their dominance . Like most big league exterminators , Jennings has spent time studying the considerable literature on rats . The literature , if you include new reports , yields such tidbits as this : ? In 1938 , a man in the basement of his Forest Park home fired several rifle shots at an aggressive rat , swatted it with a ball bat , and finally succeeded in strangling it after it clung to his leg and took four bites out of his thigh . ? In 1943 , Marines at a rat-infested base in the South Pacific promised native children a stick of gum for each rat tail delivered as evidence of a kill . In a trice , the kids brought in 15,000 tails . ? Immediately after World War II , special exterminating teams were sent to bomb-ravaged cities harboring unspeakably high rodent populations . In Tokyo alone , about 25 million rats romped in the ruins . ? In 1948 , the first rat known to have crossed the Atlantic in a passenger airplane debarked at La Guardia Airport ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutchman named Jean OliBollinger claimed to have killed 100,000 rats in a single day in Liege , Belgium . He said his secret was a poisoned paste appealing to the rats ' sexual senses . " Today , the biggest problems facing this business are tough new environmental protection controls on what kinds of poisons we can ise and strains of rats which have become resistant or immune to those poisons , " said Donald E. Resetar , service manager of another big Chicago exterminating firm . Rat hunters are restricted largely to slowcorking anti-coagulant poisons which thin a - at 's blood and causes it to die of internal temorrhaging . They 're safe to use around pets and children , but require repeated feedings to rats , which are bait-shy at best . " THE TROUBLE IS , people started buying this poison in the ' 50s and ' 60s and throwing it around indiscriminately without following up or knowing what they were doing , " said Resetar . " Actually , they were just feeding the rats , but not enough to kill them , and that 's how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no-nonsense man who is intensely professional about his work . You believe him when he tells you he has seen things like rats carrying hen 's eggs long distances by tucking them under their chins . " You want to go out on some rat jobs with one of my men ? " he asks . You agree , and early the next morning you show up wearing work clothes and heavy shoes and trying to act nonchalant . The field technician you team up with is George Stevenson , who obviously has an immense fund of knowledge about rats . You remember that earlier Resetar , wearing a look of near-ominiselence , told you , " I can kill more rats than you can because I know how rats think " ; Stevenson displays the same kind of confidence . The first stop is a tire shop and warehouse . Stevenson shines his powerful flashlight into nooks and crannies , looking for rat signs in a way that reminds you of Indian scouts in movies . He can tell you how old a rat dropping is by looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcing , " Yes , they 're right down here , all right . " SINCE RATS are creatures of habit , you must pick up their current " trails " before you know where to plant the bait . For this job Stevenson takes a loaf of bread and a can of phosphorous paste and proceeds to make a stack of what look like bread-and-butter sandwiches . The poisoned bait is placed at strategic points . " This kills them about 15 minutes after they eat it , " Stevenson confides . Next stop was a big printing plant , where Stevenson repeats his methodical tracking routine and this time elects to use an anti-coagulant . He also tells the plant manager to plug rat entry holes he has spotted a rat can squeeze thru an opening no larger than a man 's thumb . Finally , a shoe store  --  the eeriest job of all because here the rats reside in a pitch dark half-basement which requires you to walk in a crouching position . No rats in sight , but plenty of signs on a really tough job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invisible urine spots . The manager upstairs is antsy , or ratsy , because the rodents have been nibbling on shoes near the customer area and it would hardly do to have one run across the room while a lady was trying to squeeze into a size 4-AA . Stevenson makes more phosphorous sandwiches . ? And so it goes  --  today , tomorrow , and maybe forever . A small army of visible men battling a stupendous perhaps 3.7 billion and largely hidden world population of rats who eat what humans eat , live where humans-Jive , and find the arrangement most satisfactory .
