The nightmare begins with a very proper prosecutor facing a panel of potential jurors . " This case grows out of the so-called Watergate affair , " he is saying . " A ny of you who have read anything about the case-or heard radio or TV broadcasts about it-will be excused from the jury . " The nightmare ends when no qualified U.S. citizen can be found to sit in the jury box . <P> Last week Archibald Cox , the special Watergate prosecutor , outlined a muted version of just that nightmare as he asked Senator Sam Ervin 's select Watergate committee to postpone its sessions for perhaps three months . " The continuation of hearings , " said Cox , " would create grave danger that the full facts ... will never come to light , and that many of those who are guilty of serious wrongdoing will never be brought to justice . " Backed unanimously by his committee , Sam Ervin rejected " the suggestion that the Senate investigation will impede the search for truth . " As he had previously observed : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find out the truth ... than sending one or two people to jail . " <P> Although Cox reluctantly accepted the Ervin committee 's decision , he was still trying at week 's end to persuade Federal Judge John Sirica to ban the public from the hearings , or at least to ban TV and radio coverage of potential defendants like former White House Counsel John Dean . Since reporters would presumably still be admitted , the absence of TV cameras or radio microphones would hardly insulate the public from the proceedings . <P> Untidy Mix . As head of a Senate committee , Ervin has a constitutional right to press ahead , but his statement of the conflict between " the truth " and " sending one or two people to jail " seemed to concede Cox 's point that the hearings might impair future legal proceedings . A concurring opinion came from Massachusetts Judge Paul Reardon , who drafted the A.B.A. 's free press-fair trial guidelines : " The Sixth Amendment , which guarantees the accused the right to a speedy public trial by an impartial jury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> To the distant , raised eye of the London Times , the untidy mix of prosecutors , press and Congress seemed almost to amount to " a lynching " of the President . A Times editorial scored Ervin 's committee for publicizing hearsay , the Watergate grand jury for considering prejudicial evidence , and the newspapers ( especially the New York Times and the Washington Post ) for publishing leaks . It complained that much out of-court evidence , like that being offered by John Dean , was " not given under oath , not open to crossexamination " and is thus of a quality that " could hardly be less satisfactory . Yet on this evidence could well be based public conclusions which could destroy the President . " While conceding the importance of the earlier investigative work by Washington reporters , the Times wondered how Congress and the press now could " defend themselves from the very charge that they are bringing against the President , the charge of ... interfering with the course of justice .
