Barbara Walters ' mission in moving to ABC was to pull the network out of last place in the evening news sweepstakes . In two months on the job , she has delivered 300 news items , conducted 17 on-air interviews , and smiled bravely through 38 of Co-Anchorman Harry Reasoner 's sign-off witticisms . The result : ABC is still last and , in fact , further behind the leader , CBS . <P> In the nervous , numbers-obsessed world of television programming , there are two gauges of success : Nielsen ratings , which measure popularity in percentages of all TV-owning households , and audience shares , which express the preferences of only those households with sets turned on . By the second standard , ABC is not exactly burning up the air waves . Its most recent weekly audience share was 18 , the same as the average share for the month before Walters arrived . For CBS , however , the share has risen from 29 to 30 . NBC 's share has dropped from 25 to 24 . <P> ABC officials prefer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks on the job , 10.5 , with the program 's average rating for the same period a year ago , 9.9-which translates into a gain of more than 700,000 viewers . But again , CBS has done better , rising from 13.9 to 15.7 . NBC 's rating is virtually unchanged . <P> Less Room for News . The numbers are causing some concern at ABC . " We rise or fall on shares , " says one veteran Washington correspondent . " If we ca n't get the share up , things will really hit the fan . " Harry Reasoner shows some disappointment . " I wish the ratings were higher , " he says , " and I hope they will be . " <P> The fault apparently is not in the star-who has fluffed nary a line , bantered easily with Reasoner , and put even more bite into her interviews than she did on NBC 's Today show-but in her format . ABC 's half-hour newscast was restyled to include Walters ' interviews , unscripted dialogue and features on such self-help topics as health , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been less room for news . Reports from correspondents in the field , for instance , dropped to 140 in the first month of Walters ' tenure , from 168 the month before . ABC had been planning to alleviate the space problem by expanding the program to 45 minutes or an hour , but the network 's affiliate stations killed that idea a month ago . Barbara 's bosses are now de-emphasizing the self-help features and reorganizing their correspondents . They are even trying to lure heavyweight reporters from rival networks ( one target : NBC 's Tom Pettit ) . Says Walters : " We 've got a long climb ahead of us. "
