txt ill-placed weapons test could release unsuspected earth strains with possibly dangerous results . So once again a scientific study of possible links between underground testing and earthquakes finds a basis for concern . The small but real possibility of triggering an earth shock in the Cannikin test in the quake-prone Aleutians this autumn has been one of the reasons environmentalists oppose the test . In this , a roughly five-megaton blast would explode 6,200 feet beneath Amchitka Island . This particular test does not especially worry the authors of the present study  --  Prof. M. Nafi Toksiiz and Harold H. Kehrer of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) . They think the possibility that Can . nikin would trigger a disastrous shock or seismic sea wave to be remote . However , they warn that the amount of pent-up strain energy a nuclear blast might release depends far more on the nature of the site than on the size of the blast itself . So testers must beware of where they test . The study , reported in the current issue of the journal Science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a test to find out how much of the energy released came from ea rth strain . The MIT scientists find that , in some tests in Nevada , this ran to more than ten times the explosive energy of the nuclear blast itself . " The implications of these results in terms of the utility of nuclear explosions for the release of tectonic stresses and earthquake control are encouraging , " the scientists say . " In the vicinity of the shot point , such events nuclear blasts could be used to relax small regions . " They suggest that engineers might do this to deactivate an earthquake-prone site prior to building a nuclear-power plant . But they warn that they do not yet know how quickly the earthquake danger might build up again . They find that explosions in hard media such as granite release much more tectonic strain energy than do explosions in softer stuff such as volcanic tuff or salt . Moreover , the strain-release effect depends on the amount of strain involved . A highly strained region is much more likely to let go than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warn , " . nuclear testing in regions of high ambient stresses might have serious consequences . . . . Thus in any testing program . . , hard media should be avoided unless the ambient stress levels are known to be low . " // *How A-power may affect severity of earthquakes // This at once recalls Cannikin . The test hole is in a hard medium . The stress levels are definitely not known to be low . On the contrary , this is one of the most seismically active areas in the world . Stress levels might be quite high indeed . However , when asked about this , Professor Toksiiz said , " If two previous tests in that general area are indicators , there is no concern on our part . If there is built-up strain , Cannikin could release a lot of tectonic energy . But from everything we know , I think it 's a very small chance . " This is the position the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission ( AEC ) has taken . It says the test , at most , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely event a quake did result , AEC says , it would mean it was about to happen anyway . ' Sea waves unlikely As for a tsunami , the agency notes that even large natural quakes in the Amchitka area have not generated these destructive sea waves in the past . On the other hand , environmentalists insist that the admittedly small probability of releasing an earthquake should not be dismissed so lightly . The report of the ad hoc panel on the safety of underground testing prepared for the President 's Office of Science and Technology in 1968 concluded that the need for a test should be " compelling " if it is to be carried out in the face of such risks as the earthquake uncertainty . Blast size cited Dr. Gordan J. F. MacDonald , member of the President 's Council on Environmental Quality and one of the scientists who prepared the 1968 report , says the fact that two earlier Aleutian tests set off no quakes is no reason for complacency . He says one can not extrapolate those results to predict the results of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever the case turns out to be with Cannikin , the MIT study raises yet another warning for nuclear testers . And it also holds out a hope that the right kind of underground explosion might help us bring quake-producing forces under a degree of control .
