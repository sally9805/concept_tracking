THE MAN WITH A SHATTERED WORLD <P> by A.R . LURIA 165 pages . Basic Books . $6.95 . <P> <P> Nobody promised Comrade Zasetsky a rose garden ; it did not seem necessary . Before going off to fight the Germans in 1941 , he was young , healthy , bright and idealistic . He had three years of polytechnical training behind him and a beckoning future in research or development , or perhaps even a prestige niche in Soviet middle management . But in March 1943 , outside of Smolensk , a German bullet not only destroyed Zasetsky 's future but eliminated most of his past as well . <P> The wound damaged a part of his brain that deciphered perceptions of the world and bound them into some kind of order . Like a broken mirror with some pieces missing and others jumbled , Zasetsky 's shattered mind reflected the world as senseless fragments . He could not tell left from right ; he could not be sure where his arms and legs were . He saw a pair of glasses as disparate lines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could only think of the word . <P> Although Zasetsky could still speak in those simple phrases and sentences that had become reflexive , he could no longer remember anything he had learned . In the hospital he tried to decide-while attempting to muffle his rising urgency-whether to ask for a bird , a duck or a bedpan . <P> Not only did the logic of grammar escape him but the wound left him with half vision . Unless he moved his head , he could see only half a page , half a word , half a letter . The ability to analyze was also gone . During a prolonged reschooling period , a simple statement like " An elephant is bigger than a fly " took hours of explaining before the relationship was understood . Grasping a basic geometry theorem meant up to two months of solitary " thinking , " only to have the theorem forgotten days or even hours later . <P> Shattered World . " This strange illness I have is like living without a brain , " writes Zasetsky . How long it took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But after 25 years of daily effort , he has managed some 3,000 pages about his illness . The Man with a Shattered World is a selection of Zasetsky 's writings , arranged and commented on by A.R . Luria , professor of psychology at the University of Moscow . The book is equally as remarkable a document as Luria 's The Mind of a Mnemonist ( 1968 ) , which was about a man , otherwise rather ordinary , who suffered from a mind that could not forget anything . <P> The determination with which Zasetsky fought-and still fights-to escape " that know-nothing world of emptiness and amnesia " makes him anything but ordinary . The mystery of his doggedness lies somewhere in the undamaged frontal lobe of his brain . There , at the seat of the personality and emotions , he was able to battle , as Luria says , " with the tenacity of the damned . " Writing is Zasetsky 's laborious way of thinking . His achievement is that he has managed , after untold agonies and frustrations , to describe his unending confusions with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to match it . - R.Z.S.
