A TOUCH OF THE POET by Eugene O'Neill <P> O'Neill 's magnificent obsession was that a life of illusions is unpardonable but that a life without illusions is unbearable . This produces the fierce tension at the heart of his dramatic imagination . <P> In A Touch of the Poet , as elsewhere , O'Neill dramatizes , in the agitated course of a single day , the downward course of a lifetime . He tells of a man whose life would crumble except for his dreams and whose dreams themselves fall apart at last . And , as so often in O'Neill , Poet has centripetal force and centrifugal wastefulness , giant strength and giant sprawl , sure theatrical instincts and shaky dramatic structure . The present revival at Broadway 's Helen Hayes Theater is like a tidal wave that seems to purge almost every defect of the play . <P> The setting is a tavern near Boston . The time is 1828 . The hero is an O'Neill staple , the man of illusions-cum-sorrows , bottle-fed . With the aid of drink , Con Melody ( Jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaelic gallant seducing the lovelies of Europe , the fearless cavalry major decorated on a Spanish field of honor by the great Wellington himself . In sorry reality , he is an impoverished tavern keeper too proud to tend bar as his father did in Ireland . Indeed , pride hagrides Con Melody , like the Greek Furies , except that he is driven more toward travesty than tragedy . <P> In his scarlet dragoon 's uniform , he preens before a mirror and loftily mouths stanzas from Byron . Playing the highborn gentleman , though fooling no one , Con charges over the countryside on a thoroughbred mare while reducing his daughter to a barroom slavey . He sneers at the Yankees as vulgar traders while owing them money and enjoying none of their trade . <P> His fiery daughter Sara ( Kathryn Walker ) has a wealthy young Yankee in tow , and when it comes out that the boy 's father wants no truck with the peat-bog Melodys , Con rides swaggeringly forth to avenge such an insult by issuing a dueling challenge . Terribly beaten by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence , all the posturing and pride of him . This time he goes forth only to kill the last emblem of his dream , his blooded mare , his Byronic self . <P> As confirmed a dream addict as any of the tosspots in The Iceman Cometh , Con Melody is unlike them in having a family around him-a low-born wife Nora ( Geraldine Fitzgerald ) , who unfalteringly loves him , his mettlesome daughter Sara , who is increasingly roused to hate . Yet each inspires in him only a more desolating sense of aloneness . In the costly family game of lies and consequences , Con bears more than a few resemblances to O'Casey 's Paycock . <P> And a few , as well , to James Tyrone , the actor-patriarch of Long Day 's Journey into Night , whom O'Neill modeled on his own father . Con dwells on Wellington 's praise of his combat heroics as Tyrone dwells on Edwin Booth 's praise of his acting . Both men are united in a fear of the poverty of Ireland and a desire to conceal their peasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Melody despises the Jacksonian rabble just as Tyrone reviles such ( to him ) modern playwrights as Strindberg and Ibsen.
