NO one could blame the Europeans for suspecting that it might be a plot concocted by American parents . This summer as never before , their parks and piazzas , their hostels and highways are overflowing with a record-high number of blue-jeaned invaders . More than 800,000 young Americans are descending on Europe with the same ease and dispatch with which an older generation took on a trip across the state line . In the process , they are turning the travel industry upside down and creating a stir wherever they go . <P> Londoners are complaining about " pollution by package tour . " More than the usual thousands of Continental Europeans are making plans to flee their own cities this summer to avoid the youthful crush . Elderly strollers in Munich 's English Gardens glower at barefoot Brooklyn musicians standing on their heads with feet intertwined or sitting yoga-style , with begging bowls in outstretched hands . The Greek Orthodox Church in Athens has adopted a new prayer entitled " For Those Endangered by the Touristic Wave . " The words : " Lord Jesus Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the islands and the villages of our Orthodox Fatherland , as well as the holy monasteries , which are scourged by the worldly touristic wave . Grace us with a solution to this dramatic problem and protect our brethren , who are sorely tried by the modernistic spirit of these contemporary Western invaders . " <P> The big new incitement to youthful wanderlust this year is the greatest price-cutting war in airline history .

A youth-fare passenger on Sabena can fly only to and from Brussels , but on some other lines he can now mix and match . Pan Am. for example , allows a person of 25 or less to fly to one European city and return from another . Irish-Aer Lingus offers the widest choice of all - four different cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return from another , and stop over in Dublin or Shannon both coming and going . <P> Economic Consequences <P> TWA has hitched a welcome wagon of giveaways to its flights : each youth-fare passenger gets a book of coupons good for 10% to 50% discounts in restaurants and discotheques . Alitalia announced the best cost-per-mile bargain : a $199 round trip between New York and Rome . Icelandic Airlines , dubbed the " hiphop airline " by the hairy hordes who prefer it . rolled out the cheapest European youth fare : a $185 round trip between Aug. 1 and Sept. 10. and $165 the rest of the year . <P> As a result of the price cuts , 1971 will be one of the biggest years ever for going places . All together , more than 3,500,000 Americans and Canadians will cross the Atlantic this year . Because of the recession , the recalcitrance of the stock market and the horse-and-buggy pace of economic recovery , even middle-aged tourists will be looking for bargains rather than luxury .
