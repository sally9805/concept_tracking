" This is a shoestring operation , " says Frank Church , who , despite a late start and a money shortage , has won three primaries in three tries . His dream now is to capture Montana and Rhode Island this week , win Ohio next week , and run second to Jerry Brown in California . Few expect him to do all-or even most-of that , but he may well become a factor at the Democratic Convention . On an economy-class flight from Portland , Ore. , Church talked to TIME West Coast Bureau Chief Jess Cook : <P> <P> Q. On what issues do you disagree most sharply with Jimmy Carter ? <P> <P> A. I do n't know his stands on many positions . His whole campaign has dealt in generalities as far as I can see . <P> <P> Q. Where do you disagree with Carter on foreign policy ? <P> <P> A. I agree with the general principles he refers to . But I 've had proposals over the years to turn our foreign policy away from established directions . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital interests are not at stake . We should withdraw all military forces from the mainland of Asia . Long ago I called for an end to bilateral foreign aid programs , which we dish up every year to the tune of $8 billion to $10 billion . I would substitute long-term economic programs in concert with other major countries . <P> <P> Q. What are your chief differences with Brown ? <P> <P> A. The presidency is no place for on-the-job training . I 've always advocated the politics of substance , not the politics of style . All I know about him is the image . <P> <P> Gf . Are you saying he has too much gall ? <P> <P> A. I do n't believe in an instant presidency . <P> <P> Q. Does that mean yes ? A. Yes <P> Q. Do you rule out Hubert Humphrey 's chances for the nomination because he has not entered the primaries ? <P> <P> A. If the convention were to turn to someone who had not gone to the people , then I think that the people would feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would create a backlash against the primary system . I 'll support <P> Hubert Humphrey if he is nominated , but it would be a serious mistake . <P> <P> Q. Do you favor the Humphrey-Hawkins full-employment bill ? <P> <P> A. I support it-but it 's just a palliative . It is n't the answer unless we want everyone to end up on the Government payroll . What we really need is to rejuvenate our private economy . We should recognize the extent to which we are exporting our jobs through the export of capital . That process is reaching hemorrhage proportions . Yet public policy tilts investment abroad through the tax system and subsidized Government insurance for investments abroad . <P> <P> Q. Is there a single overriding issue in this campaign ? <P> <P> A. Politically , to re-establish the legitimacy of the Government in the eyes of the people .
