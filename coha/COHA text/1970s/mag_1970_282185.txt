The identity of the author of this communication has been suppressed for reasons which may be self-evident , but the author , whose work has been vouched for by a colleague , has answered a number of questions raised by a referee . <P> With this sober explanation , the staid British science journal Nature published a paper by a Cambridge University scientist who has reached a remarkable conclusion : the rate of growth of the male 's beard seems to be related to his sexual activity . <P> The anonymous scientist , who is a bachelor , had been living and working for weeks at a time on a remote island ; no women were on hand to distract him . In these monastic circumstances , he soon noticed an intriguing phenomenon : his beard was growing less rapidly than normal . Furthermore , on the day before each of his periodic returns to the mainland and reunions with a receptive female ( also unidentified ) , his facial hair began to sprout at a prodigious rate . The implications were staggering . Could the mere thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seeking the answer , the scientist set up an experiment in which he eagerly served as a guinea pig . After each daily shave with an electric razor , he meticulously collected and weighed the amount of hair that had been removed . He also devised a zero-to-five scale for rating each day 's activities-including mental and physical exertion , degree of nervousness , amount of sleep and occurrence of intercourse . <P> The results were as unmistakable as the fuzz on his face . By Friday , as the weekend intimacies approached , his beard growth had increased by nearly 20% over its midweek rate . But after his sexual needs were fulfilled , hair growth abated . On Monday , in fact , his stubble was shorter than on any other day of the week . <P> The reason for this phenomenon is apparently rooted in hormonal activities . Facial hair , a secondary male sexual characteristic , is largely governed by production of male hormones called androgens . Indeed , one of these compounds -testosterone-is known to be secreted by the testicles in greater quantities during intercourse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release of androgens even with the anticipation of sex . " Even the presence of particular female company in the absence of intercourse , after a period of separation , usually caused an obvious increase in beard growth . " As a byproduct of his research , the scientist also found that increased beard growth was associated with tension , mental fatigue , alcohol and increased shaving . On the other hand , it is apparently curtailed by heavy exercise and high temperatures . <P> Do the findings of the anonymous researcher have any scientific value ? " It seems , " he concludes in proper scientific jargon , " that beard growth in a man is a much-neglected parameter of hormone activity that can readily be quantified . "
