" To understand man , we have to understand the brain . " <P> <P> If man ever succeeds in reaching this goal , most neuroscientists today agree that much of the credit will belong to the author of that statement , Dr. Francis Otto Schmitt , a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Although he is a skilled researcher in molecular biology , Schmitt is best known in his profession as a scientific impresario . He is the founder , chairman and most enthusiastic member of the M.I.T.-sponsored Neurosciences Re search Program . It is from the work of this group that a comprehensive theory of brain function could well emerge . <P> Founded in 1962 , the N.R.P. represents Schmitt 's attempt to get science 's " wets " ( chemists ) and " drys " ( physicists ) together to work on the mystery of the brain . The organization is a loose federation of scientists who are themselves connected with such prestigious institutions as the University of California , Germany 's Max Planck Institutes and the National Institutes of Health . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Meeting regularly to discuss specific topics and staying in constant communication by letter and telephone , they hope to accomplish together what none could succeed in I doing alone . Five of the N.R.P. 's ' 36 associates have won Nobel Prizes for their work in chemistry , medicine or physiology . <P> But merely being Nobel laureates entitles them to no special consideration in what the scientific community acknowledges is a tough outfit . A couple of Nobelists were transferred to consultant status when they became too busy to participate in N.R.P. 's demanding schedule of meetings . <P> The dean of this unique college is as impressive as the faculty . Born in St. Louis in 1903 , Schmitt studied medicine at Washington University , published two papers in Science before his 20th birthday and received his doctorate in physiology* before going abroad for two years of study in England and Germany . He returned to Washington U. , where he remained on the faculty until moving to M.I.T. in 1941 . <P> Schmitt pioneered the use of X-ray diffraction and polarization optics to explore the inner workings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was invented . Head of the team that was first in the U.S. to use an electron microscope for studying biological tissues , he is also well known for his work on collagen , the clear protein material that fills the spaces between cells . <P> His research , which led to an understanding of how the collagen molecule is constructed , won him the coveted Lasker Award in 1956 . <P> ?
