CONGO DIARY AND OTHER UNCOLLECTED PIECES by Joseph Conrad Edited by Zdzislaw Najder ; Doubleday ; 192 pages ; $7.95 <P> In 1903 Joseph Conrad was asked by a London weekly to list the books he read as a boy . " I do n't remember any child 's book ; I do n't think I ever read any , " the Polish-born author replied . " The first book I remember distinctly is Hugo 's Travailleurs de la Mer Toilers of the Sea , which I read at the age of seven . " <P> Today Conrad has replaced Victor Hugo . A similar survey of contemporary writers would turn up many of the master 's titles : An Outcast of the Islands , Lord Jim , Typhoon , Nostromo , The Secret Agent and his greatest story , Heart of Darkness . His ominous Slavic intensity and his understated English produced a prose style that generations have found intoxicating . Countless youths acquired their first sense of literary power in such passages as " When an opportunity offered at last to meet my predecessor , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bones . " <P> Congo Diary traces the first autobiographical flutters of that sentence from Heart of Darkness . After more than ten years as a seaman and officer in the British merchant navy , Conrad signed a three-year contract with a Belgian company to serve on river steamboats that plied the Congo River . " Like an empty Huntley and Palmer biscuit tin " was his description of boats like the Roi des <P> Belges , the double-decked stern-wheeler that he sailed up to Stanley Falls . Heart of Darkness conveys the dwarfing effect that the 1,000-mile journey must have had on the 32-year-old Conrad : " Trees , trees , millions of trees , massive , immense , running up high ; and at their foot , hugging the bank against the stream , crept the little begrimed steamboat , like a sluggish beetle crawling on the floor of a lofty portico . " <P> Yet truth is often flatter than fiction . <P> In the part of the Diary known as the " Upriver Book , " Conrad is all business , the professional sailor noting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the high mountain ahead crossing over to the left bank . To port of highest mount a low black point . Opposite a long island stretching across . The shore is wooded . " <P> The-1890 adventures hi the Congo altered the course of the writer 's life and art . He returned to England disillusioned and physically racked by tropical sickness . In addition , the destructive effects of Belgian colonialism on tribal life made a lasting impression on the son of a Polish patriot who had been jailed and exiled for his activities against Russian imperialism . During an overland trek from Matadi to Kinshasa , the Diary notes , he " met an officer of the State inspecting ; a few minutes afterwards saw at a camp-ing place the dead body of a Backongo . <P> <P> Shot ? Horrid smell . " And later : " Today did not set the tent but put up in Government shimbek . Zanzibari in charge-very obliging . Met ripe pineapple for the first time . On the road today passed a skeleton tied up to a post . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of a cross . " <P> Among those whom Conrad met in the Congo was Roger Casement , at the
