FINISHING TOUCHES by JEAN KERR <P> The middle-aged male in a psychic or physical funk is very much in vogue this season on Broadway . We have seen that theme treated in That Championship Season and Butley , and now in Finishing Touches . Each of these plays fires off salvos of laughter , and yet each also imparts an unsettling mood of deep , free-floating anxiety . <P> The hero of Touches is a 43-year-old college English teacher named Jeff Cooper who is fretting about a full professorship . Jeff ( Robert Lansing ) comes home from the classroom one day and tells his wife Katy ( Barbara Bel Geddes ) that he is falling in love with a nubile student . Being the rare wife who is the first to know does not prevent Katy from being cataclysmically shaken by her husband 's startling don't-kiss-but-tell confession . Bel Geddes beautifully conveys outward bravado and inner terror . <P> Katy 's emotional world does not mend appreciably when her son brings home from Harvard an actress with whom he has been sleeping .

After 25 platonic minutes he is back home , ready for a reconciliation . <P> There has always been a disconcerting rift in Jean Kerr 's plays between the witty , wise and thoroughly honest statements she makes about domestic life and the artificial plot mechanics she adopts for the sake of happy endings . <P> In some ways , the emotional substructure of the play has more density and complexity than its surface . At one point , Katy says she wishes that it was 1948 . This is not merely a wistful desire to be young again ; it is a hunger for the relatively stable value system of that era . <P> The Cooper generation was taught to go to church on Sundays , to enter marriage , often virginally , on a till-death-do-us-part vow , to obey its parents and expect obedience from its children . For these familial and marital mores , the middle class has been mocked and undermined for years . Time may well vindicate Jean Kerr 's conviction that innocence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family is the quintessential social unit without which civilization disintegrates in anarchy . T.E .
