txt The clanking battle over returnable vs. one-way bottles may turn out to have been only a skirmish in the antipollution war . Unlike most wars , this one may turn out to be one which everyone wins and no one loses . Partisan issues in the bottle battle have been somewhat less than noble . Chain stores have refused to handle returnable bottles in some areas . In New York City , the A &P; chain has completely swept them of its shelves , because they are a nuisance . Bottling companies , for the most part , have caved in to the chain stores ' dislike of returnables and have gone the one-way road . Customers have hardly been innocent victims . In some cities , such as conservative Boston , they continue to willingly save pennies by lugging back the empties every marketing day . But in most other cities  --  with New York , as usual , the worst culprit ? they shun returnables as if they contained arsenic .

After weeks , only a few cases full had been picked up and redeemed by local residents . ) Environmentalists have attacked the one-way bottle as a waste of a natural resource , but mainly because it adds to the nation 's total of solid-waste pollution . Just this week a bill was introduced in the House that would ban throwaway bottles and cans . The bill would provide fines of up to $1,000 or six months ' imprisonment for violating the ban . Now , glass-container advocates argue , recycling of glass is the answer to both customer convenience and environmental preservation . Studies by the United States Bureau of Mines indicate that glass can be recovered economically from municipal-incinerator residue . Experiments at the bureau 's Tuscaloosa Metallurgy Research Lab have found economic uses for the " cullet , " in glass-insulating wool , brick , floor , and wall tile . It is already being used as a component of " glassphalt , " for roadtopping . Further bureau tests are seeking other uses . // *Battle of bottles escalates // But the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where the industry has traditionally used about 5 percent of cullet in its new glass , some plants are now using 10 percent in their total raw-materials mix . Glass Container Manufacturers Institute ( GCMI ) research points to 30 percent and perhaps even 50 percent cullet content in new-glass manufacture . More realistic goal For the present , says John G. Turk , director of GCMI 's research efforts , 30 percent is the more realistic goal . That means reclaiming approximately one-third of the glass bottles and jars which up to now have been thrown onto America 's rubbish heaps , or approximately 11 billion bottles a year . To accomplish this , GCMI has set up a network of 92 bottle-redemption centers at or near glass-container plants in 25 states . Trial programs in different areas have proven successful . In Los Angeles , a program begun April 20 brought in 30,000 bottles a week to start , and by June 30 this was up to half-a-million bottles a week .

As optimists see it Owens-Illinois of Toledo , Ohio , cosponsored an experimental program in Ann Arbor , Mich. , with ENACT ( Environmental Action for Survival ) recently . In a two-day drive , it recovered 65 tons of glass , most of it gathered from dumps and along roadsides . Owens-Illinois felt the experiment was successful enough to justify a permanent glass-collection program in the university community . If , ultimately , the Bureau of Mines research programs on glass recovery and recycling are borne out , the bottle battle will be over . The public desire for convenience will be met , and technology will have saved the public from its own folly . Or so the optimists would have it . As for the aluminum can , which is making such rapid inroads on the glass bottle , it , too , is subject to recycling . In fact , the aluminum industry already gets some 20 percent of its raw materials from scrap .

Reynolds Aluminum Company is shelling out many research dollars on recycling possibilities . Richard L. Cheney , executive director of GCMI , foresees the day when salvaging of all waste materials will be a big business in its own right . To this end , GCMI is supporting research at Stanford Research Institute , in cooperating with the Public Health Service , to develop an automated , low-cost system of separating raw-trash components . Processing stations He looks forward to " a nationwide network of processing stations where municipalities , or perhaps even utilities , separate wastes mechanically . . . . " Such a system , as envisioned by GCMI , would ultimately result in near-total conservation of natural resources . Most experts on environmental control and conservation agree that total recycling is the ultimate answer . Its day , however , is still far off .
