Walter Hickel gave up his job as Governor of Alaska in 1969 to go to Washington as President Nixon 's first Secretary of the Interior .

Hickel made the observation , which then seemed presumptuous , that Nixon had cut himself off from the outside world ; worse , he allowed that view to leak out to the public . In his current bid for a second term as Alaska 's Governor , Hickel , 55 , used his dismissal as a point in his favor , but it was not enough to win him victory . <P> In last week 's Republican gubernatorial primary , the Kansas-born , millionaire real estate developer was defeated by a bearded poet-fisherman-bush pilot and big-game guide named Jay Hammond . <P> A former president of the state senate , Hammond , 52 , is mayor of the borough of Bristol Bay and lives in the Eskimo fishing village of South Naknek . <P> A decided underdog when he entered the race , Hammond stumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , son of the radio commentator , who won the G.O.P. nomination for Lieutenant Governor . At a time when Alaska is in the throes of pipeline fever , their winning platform surprisingly calls for " careful scrutiny " of the state 's rapid growth and " no development for development 's sake . " In November , Hammond will face Governor William A. Egan , who was easily renominated in last week 's Democratic primary .
