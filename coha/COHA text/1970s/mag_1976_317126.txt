Few politicians are willing to take on Virginia 's Senator Harry Flood Byrd Jr . Byrd is running as an independent , no Republican is challenging him , and several Democrats have dropped out . That leaves the field open to Admiral Elmo Russell Zumwalt Jr . ( ret. ) , former Chief of Naval Operations , who will announce his candidacy on the Democratic ticket in a few weeks . <P> The race will pit a formidable family dynasty against a brilliant and out spoken military man . Zumwalt , 55 , was the youngest CNO ever , helped humanize the service and raised its re-enlistment rate from 9.5% to 30% . <P> Zumwalt has been making news not by lambasting Byrd but by launching a flanking attack on a personal target-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger . He accuses Kissinger of " lying in his teeth " when the Secretary soft-pedaled violations of nuclear arms agreements by the U.S.S.R. , of running " a secret , Metternichian policy that seeks to mislead , not to lead , and of " creating peace in our time by pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's assault seems an odd political tactic since Byrd , also a supporter of the Pentagon , has not taken any stand for or against Kissinger 's policies . Nevertheless , veteran Virginia politicians give Zumwalt a slim fighting chance to upset Byrd.
