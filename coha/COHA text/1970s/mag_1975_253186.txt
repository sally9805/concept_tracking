As they prepared for the Christmas holiday last week , some Americans suffered second thoughts about traveling by air . Much of their fear of flying was caused by the recent and widely publicized spate of near collisions involving commercial airliners . On Thanksgiving Eve , 24 people were injured when an American Airlines jet dived just in time to avert a collision with a Trans World Airlines plane over Michigan . A fortnight ago , another pair of planes , one a TWA , the other a United Air Lines jet , passed within 300 ft. of each other as both were heading for Chicago 's O'Hare International Airport . There were other close calls in the Chicago area that day . Shortly before the two big jets avoided disaster , a twin-engine Cessna en route to a small field north of O'Hare crossed in front of a North Central Airways turboprop . Later , a privately owned Jet Commander descended through the path of another TWA aircraft . <P> Considering the amount of traffic in some of the nation 's air space , it should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprising , given the chances for mechanical and human failure both on the ground and in the cockpit , is that there are so few collisions . Of 81 fatal accidents suffered by airlines during the past decade , only seven involved collisions . <P> That remarkably good record can be attributed largely to improvement in air-traffic control . Until the mid-1960s , air-traffic controllers had to rely on old-fashioned radar to scan the skies and keep track of moving " blips " that represented individual aircraft . Now the controllers ' vision has been increased enormously by improved radar and new electronic gadgetry . Every aircraft that flies above 18,000 ft. and in designated control areas carries a radar transponder that answers ground radar by flashing an identifying signal . The ground radar is assisted by banks of computers that display on the radar screen right next to each blip a printed data block containing the aircraft 's identification , flight number , altitude and speed . With that information a controller can determine when one plane is getting too close to another . Control is now being further improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The computers that keep track of the aircraft also search for planes within two minutes ' flying time of a hazardous situation . When they find one , they flash a warning to the air-traffic controller , who can then give one or both planes directions to avoid an accident . C.A. has already gone into operation at the Denver , Fort Worth , Kansas City and Memphis air-route traffic control centers . FAA officials are now planning to speed up the installation schedule at other control centers.
