txt Qantas , the Australian international airline , paid $560,000 in cash yesterday to a hoaxer who had convinced airline officials that there was a bomb on a plane bound for Hong Kong with 116 passengers and 12 crew members . After the airline 's general manager handed over the mon-1 ey to a young man with a false beard , the company received a telephone call saying that there was no bomb on the plane . The aircraft , a Boeing 707 , then landed safely at the Sydney International Airport , after nearly six hours of circling at 35,000 feet while it was thoroughly searched . The drama began shortly after the plane took off on a nonstop flight from Sydney to Hong Kong at 11:30 A.M. Sydney time ( 9:30 P.M. Tuesday Eastern daylight time ) . At 12:15 P.M. a man calling himself Mr. Brown telephoned the Department of Civil Aviation in Sydney and said that a bomb was in a locker at the Sydney airport and that a similar bomb was aboard the plane . The caller said the bombs were designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Searchers found the bomb in the locker a few minutes later . With it were ? three typewritten notes . One note , addressed to Capt . R. J. Ritchie , the Qantas general manager , demanded $500,000 ? $560,000 in United States currency ? in exchange ' for directions on how to find ' and dismantle the bomb said to , be aboard the plane . The three ) notes were signed " Mr. Brown . " Qantas immediately notified : he pilot of the plane by radio , ' The pilot , Capt . William Selwind 49 years old , ordered a search of the aircraft . Passengers were not told of the bomb scare until the plane had landed although many realized the situation as the search was carried out . A Qantas spokesman said today that when the plane landed its fuel supply was ' fairly close to our operational requirement " for only 15 minutes more flight . The note with the bomb in the airport locker said that the device in the aircraft had been set so that it would automatically explode by increased air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal cruising altitude of more than 30,000 . When officials confirmed that the bomb in the locker fitted the description of the device said to be aboard the plane , Qantas decided to pay the money , a spokesman for the airline said . " It was not a question of the $500,000 but of the passengers aboard , " John Ulm , chief public relations officer for the airline , told reporters . Authorities noted that the in- ! oiclent duplicated the plot of a ' movie shown on television here ' on March 2 . In the film , " Doomsday ' Flight , " a bomb activated by air pressure was aboard a plane ' flying from New York to the West Coast . It was set to explode when the plane dropped to 5,000 feet . The pilot , played by Van Johnson , foiled the plot by landing the plane at the Denver Airport , 5,280 feet above sea level . Planes and Ships Deployed Yesterday , with the Qantas plane circling at 35,000 feet while the crew searched the aircraft , the Australian Gov-ernment deployed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosion disabled the airliner . Captain Selwin , the pilot , told reporters that he had not been " unduly alarmed " but had been " a little anxious as we were coming in to land at Sydney . " " We were not certain that the bomb was aboard and I told the passengers there was a technical difficulty and that we would have to circle until clearance was given to land , " he said . He said that the plane , held at 35,000 feet , was depressurized to the equivalent of 22,000 feet to allow a more thorough search . " We removed every conceiv-I able panel to find the object , " Captain Selwin said . " All the passengers cooperated with my request and all baggage was searched . " Passengers Interviewed after the plane landed said that everyone aboard had been calm . " Eventually the steward said they were searching for a small parcel about 10 inches by 6 inches , " said Mrs. N. L. Thompson , an Australian passenger .

" On receiving the warning by radio , Captain Selwin brought the plane back to Australia 's east coast and circled Brisbane for nearly three hours and then flew to Sydney and circled two and . a half hours more . Finally informed that the incident was a hoax , he landed the plane here at 6:40 P.M. While the plane was circling , a series of telephone calls from a man who called himself " Mr. Brown " instructed airline officials how to pay the ransom . Money Would n't Fit The first call instructed that the money be left in the airport locker where the bomb was found . In a second call , an official told the caller that the money would not fit in the locker . A third telephone call instructed Qantas to be prepared to give the cash to a man in a small van outside the company 's office in downtown Sydney . The money , in two suitcases . was handed over by the airline 's general manager at 5:45 P.M .. to a man in a van that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was described as about 25 years old with long hair and a false beard . About 20 minutes later , " Mr. Brown ' ' called for the last time to say that there was no bomb aboard the plane . Shortly afterwards , the policed found the yellow van aban-i doned on a main street in canral Sydney .
