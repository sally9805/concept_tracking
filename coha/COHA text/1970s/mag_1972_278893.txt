&gt;Passengers in planes stacked up over a congested airport may find the experience nervousmaking , but travelers only rarely have to endure that kind of tension . For air traffic controllers on the ground , facing the possibility of causing a calamity each working day , the stress is unremitting and the effects on the digestive system horrendous . A study by the newly formed Academy of Air Traffic Control Medicine in St. Charles , 111. , shows that ulcers are distressingly commonplace among control-tower personnel . The annual incidence in American physicians , for example , is between 9% . Dr. Richard Grayson has examined 111 air controllers since 1970 and reports that 77.5% had symptoms severe enough to make further tests essential ; 32.5% actually had ulcers . <P> &gt;Medical authorites generally blame poor sanitation , blood transfusions and drug addicts ' needles for the spread of serum hepatitis , a debilitating and sometimes fatal liver disease . Now it appears that the mosquito might also transmit the ailment . Studies by Rutgers University , the New York Blood Center and the New Jersey Medical School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person known to be a chronic carrier of hepatitis , the laboratory-raised insects retained the virus for three days and presumably could have transmitted the infection if allowed to attack another victim . The researchers know of no hepatitis cases that can be attributed directly to mosquitoes , but the source of the disease is often untraceable . The new findings are yet another reason for communities to conduct vigorous anti-mosquito campaigns . <P> &gt;Among the causes of pain in rheumatoid arthritis are inflammation of the synovium ( the membrane lining the joint capsule ) and subsequent erosion of the enclosed cartilage and bone . Doctors generally prescribe painkillers and other anti-inflammatory drugs including common aspirin . But according to Dr. Alan Wilde of the Cleveland Clinic , early surgery may provide more permanent relief and slow the progress of the disease as well . Wilde told a scientific session of the Arthritis foundation that he had performed synovectomies on 39 patients , delicately removing the inflamed tissue from a total of 121 finger joints . Most of the patients experienced complete relief of pain , while a few showed partial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third of the patients . In nearly half , the deterioration stopped , while in a few cases , removal of the diseased synovium actually casued the damaged cartilage to heal .
