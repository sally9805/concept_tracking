There was nothing spectacular about her , but when she came into the office you felt that she merited the attention she at once obtained , She was , you could say without straining a point , rather good-looking , but she was not nearly so good-looking as most women would have to be to make a comparable impression . She spoke in the crisp , fluttery cadence of the British , consistently sounding her " r 's " and " ing 's " and regularly saying " been " as they do in London . For a girl born and raised in Georgia , such speaking could suggest affectation . Yet it was the very opposite of this quality that contributed a great deal to the pleasing effect she invariably produced on those who met her . Naive has so many inapplicable connotations it is hardly the word to use in reference to this urbane and gracious presence , yet it is difficult to think of our first meeting without that very word coming to mind , with its overtones of freshness , artlessness , and candor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Neither her face nor her figure had lost anything worth mentioning . Despite her composure , she gave a distinct impression of energy and playful spontaneity , an impression of vivid youth . In response to ordinary questions about her activities and interests she spoke of tennis , riding , and reading . She expressed opinions on current affairs that seemed to make excellent sense and talked with wit about the cyclic changes in feminine clothes and the implications of atomic physics for the future . As discussion progressed , the picture of a rather remarkable woman became more and more distinct . Here was evidence of high intelligence and of considerable learning without discernible bookishness or consciousness of being " an intellectual . " Her manner suggested wide interest , fresh and contagious enthusiasms , and a taste for living that reached out toward all healthy experience . Having a cup of coffee with her or weeding a garden would somehow take on a special quality of fun and delightfulness . Something about her over and beyond her looks prompted the estimate that she would be very likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who encountered her . Here , it seemed , was natural taste without a shadow of posed aestheticism , urbanity without blunting of response to the simplest of joys , integrity and good ethical sense with the very opposite of everything that could be called priggish or smug . She showed nothing to suggest she meant to give such an impression or that she had any thought as to how she seemed . Prior to this interview a great deal of trustworthy information had been made available to me . Anna 's mother and father had given her story at length . It is too much of a story to tell in a chapter or in a single book . And , no matter how told , it could not be believed except by those who have already had experience over years with such pat-tents of behavior . Her family first became aware that Anna had serious problems through the discovery of a boys ' club in the local high school which , if not exactly founded in her honor , had at least been organized about her as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their early teens , a secret society in a sense , the group , like many Greek letter fraternities , had special phrases , symbolic signs , and countersigns . Encountering each other at the soda fountain or passing in the school corridor , two boys might slowly flex the fingers of their hands ( so as to suggest a rounded aperture , possibly ) , leaving their arms dangling as if to veil slightly from alien observers a mystic communication . First and fundamentally , the comprehension of the entire adult world was glibly evaded by this communications system . Like dozens of other small , spontaneously forming and dissolving fraternities centered around interests that ranged from bird study to techniques of mutual masturbation , the group whose special interest lay in Anna did not for a while attract undue orsustained scrutiny from the adult world . The club had come into being after a discussion among several boys heretofore not particularly well acquainted with one another . Chat had veered desultorily from literal accounts of what they had done to certain girls to playful variations on the theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastic ) use of strongly obscene words . Each of the boys had , in fact , been surprised and , though this was not admitted , also shocked to discover through their shared experiences that Anna was not a " nice girl . " A confused disillusionment no doubt played some part in their emphasis on the opposite evaluation of this girl who had , rather typically , represented the " sacred " ( sexless ) female in their thoughts . The fear of so honoring a female who turned out to be this other sort of thing loomed as a threat to one 's own manhood . The untouchable priestess , once disclosed as an impostor , must be thoroughly defiled . Thus man sometimes seeks protection from confusion through which he himself risks the defilement of personally enshrining one who will make his virility ( honor ) the laughingstock of the group . All of the boys found a special pleasure in talking together about their achievements . Soon a friend was told about their source of pleasure , then another friend , and still another . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual pleasure , but as time passed it became more practical for several to visit her together . An appointment would be made by one of those interested . Anna , under the pretext of taking a walk or going to visit a friend , would , without detection , make her way to a building situated on the other side of the large garden behind her house . Now used as a storehouse and garage , the building was originally a stable , and its former hayloft afforded reasonable privacy . The boys , by coming from another street through a hedge back of the garage , could make their way unnoticed to the rendezvous . Safe opportunities , though fairly frequent , were limited because the chauffeur was sometimes in the garage . There were also days when the yard man worked nearby , or , rarely , Anna 's brother might be there exercising with barbells and other gymnastic equipment he kept Dr. Cleckley  --  clinical professor of psychiatry at the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta  --  has been a frequent contributor of articles to learned journals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author of The Caricature of Love and of the famous Three Faces of Eve , as well as of The Mask of Sanity , from which the article has been extracted . in another part of the building . This , no doubt , was a factor in the group 's choice of coming together , particularly as its membership expanded . Of even more importance , perhaps , was a specific satisfaction found by some in entering upon the venture together . The closely shared experience seemed to enhance the pleasures of club conversation when they gathered later to talk over what happened . After chapel in the morning it was customary for the captain of the baseball team , the chairman of the debating club , and others interested in extracurricular activities occasionally to announce plans for meetings of their various groups . One morning , in response to a dare by other club members , Jack came forward and in a bold voice called out : " At the beginning of lunch hour there 'll be a meeting of the Animal Crackers in Room 49 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the part of a few teachers , but no official inquiry about the club was made and no adult thought of any play on Anna 's name or caught improper innuendos . The existence of the club and their daughter 's undesirable situation was finally brought to the attention of Anna 's parents through its effect on another person . Among the older boys who had been attracted by Anna was one who had apparently turned to her in the utmost seriousness . All accessible information indicates that this boy fell in love with Anna not by a trivial attraction but with all the vividness and life-shaking stir that the first complete and genuine experience of this sort can bring to an earnest young man almost ready for college . The younger girl , suddenly having become mature in body , loomed like something never seen before upon his awareness . There is reason to believe that he was determined to marry her and resolved to be scrupulously faithful through all the years he must wait for this . There is nothing to suggest he did not seek her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and fear of arousing even further impulses , which it would have been for him a desecration to fulfill under these conditions , caused him to treat her , if not like an untouchable goddess , at least with extraordinary restraint . Anna , it seems , behaved in such a way that he was sure she reciprocated his feelings not only in kind but also in degree . Reports as to how he discovered the relations of Anna with the club are somewhat conflicting . It is almost impossible to believe that fortune was so unkind as to have him blunder upon an actual meeting of this group with the customary activities in progress . So it is said to have happened . At any rate , he received enlightenment in // such a convincing way that the impact was sudden and trenchant . In his immediately subsequent state , rumored to be a " nervous breakdown " at the time , his family physician , after considerable difficulty , seems to have obtained some idea of what he had experienced . Being a relative of Anna 's mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation demanded attention and disclosed something of it to her parents . Anna 's apparent reactions were such as to enable all the family to be entirely sincere in showing her their continued confidence , their respect , and their love . In choosing a fine private school with high academic standards , she seemed to be showing her serious intentions about the future . Her keen interest in choosing clothes , her care in getting exactly the right sort of curtains for the dormitory room might have suggested to some almost too easy and quick a recovery from the fell blow she was thought to have suffered , but at the time this seemed instead a fit and appealing veil of insouciance that she bravely , if not almost heroically , pulled about her to conceal with stoic and patrician grace the terrible trauma her spirit had sustained . Even in the short period of time before she left for boarding school , Anna 's outwardly blithe air that she displayed when she joked and laughed with friends who came by ( her ability to seem blandly preoccupied in getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shop was expecting any day now ) provoked fleeting but ominous thoughts in the family that such poise , considering the full circumstances , might be a little excessive . Excellent reports on Anna came for several months from the distant school . She was doing well in her studies and already she had won a place on the swimming team . She seemed also to have found herself almost at once in the warm affection of teachers and students . One teacher , in a letter to her mother , spoke of Anna 's " unusual promise in English " and of her " surprising maturity of outlook . " Anna 's own letters , although few , were warm with expressions of devotion that seemed to follow the inimitable idiom of sincerity . In these letters she sometimes mentioned her conviction that she knew of no way to express her gratitude except to show by her own conduct that she did deserve the trust her mother and father had shown in her and the support of their love and understanding . No happiness could mean more than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud of her again . Such letters were building up in these parents an encouragement they sorely needed and offering ( as an anodyne for their anguish and humiliation ) increasing hope that as parents they had not , perhaps , failed their daughter utterly . Meanwhile , reports began to come from the school which seriously disquieted them . Anna had apparently broken a number of rules , most of them involving minor issues , it is true . She had twice been caught smoking with several other girls ; she had four times stayed outconsiderably beyond hours ; she had cut several classes ; she had spoken disrespectfully to a teacher . But , after all , such misdemeanors often indicate a healthy sort of growing up and her parents were anxious to avoid forcing Anna into a rigid pharisaical propriety as compensation for her terrible error . When a final decision was reached that Anna could not be kept at school , a good many more serious symptoms had come to light . Several petty thieveries ( at first assumed to be absentminded borrowings ) , flagrant but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were accepted as points of honor  --  all of this added up to make her expulsion imperative . At the half dozen or more subsequent schools attended by Anna , she often seemed to have changed , and for varying periods her family 's hope was high . Her behavior at each place fell into similar but not identical patterns . Like the " It says , ' I 've decided to take it all with me , even the lawyer 's fee . ' " persisting theme in a complicated work of music , her actions took diverse courses but came always to an identical point , which for her was failure . Once or twice Anna completed the entire year , but nearly always each new institution found itself unable to handle her after a few months . Sometimes she worked steadily during the summer and easily completed courses she had missed in her numerous shiftings about . Perhaps on the basis of an excellent performance on the entrance examination , she gained admission to a distinguished college for women and , after being expelled , briefly attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions she undertook training in business school , in hospitals ( nursing , X-ray technician , etc. ) , and welfare work . She often expressed spontaneously a lively interest in this or that career and worked out her plans with good judgment , but , after widely varying periods during which she applied herself , she regularly ended by quitting voluntarily or being dismissed . The odd thing was that when Anna sought some new job with which to occupy herself or toenter some course of training , she seemed to have no hesitation in giving as references those who had no choice except to describe her as entirely unreliable and unfit for what she planned . Sometimes the reason for her failures seemed not to lie so much in antisocial or spectacularly improper acts as in other maladaptations . A few excerpts from a letter follow : . This student , we are compelled to say , was a definitely dangerous worker to have around roentgenological apparatus . It became necessary to watch her carefully . She could not be trusted to carry out things on her own responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she always showed amazement and disbelief that she could possibly be doing anything wrong . She appeared to be sincere in such reactions . . . . I find it i ? - possible to recommend this person for work along these lines . . I am convinced that her performance would be detrimental to the profes- sion or to any group for which she might work . From one prep school she was dismissed though standing high in her classes after it was proved she had placed a half dozen or more rubber condoms so that these useful items would become unmistakably evident when several couples seated themselves on the two sofas that flanked the fireplace . Here , almost directly under chaperoning eyes , the younger pupils not yet given permission to go out with their boyfriends had circumspect dates on certain evenings . No sudden scurrying of mice could have evoked more hearty squeals or such quick explosive male lathier than the magielike appearance of these unmistakable objects , some neatly rolled . others generously stuffed . Had only one or perhaps even two of the condoms emerged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seating of couples . it might have been possible for an alert girl , or perhaps even for one of the self-conscious and preoccupied boys , to cover it and hide it away before general attention was aroused . Anna , it seems . had given some thought to this . Perhaps with time and retelling , some exaggeration has colored the event . It is said that an elastic band was set to snap one condom boldly forth and that others were placed so they would slip down from under the knitted antimacassars . At any rate , Anna made certain of a conspicuous display . Struck almost witless by the magic appearance of such an object in her lap ( whence it had dropped from the top of the sofa ) , one girl released the initial squeal . Such uproar ensued automatically that hastening chaperones missed little of the scene . On numerous occasions Anna made difficulties for herself by driving off in cars that belonged to teachers or other school employees . Only once , or possibly twice , during her teens does it appear she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , there were periods when she frequently stole underwear , stockings , and ornaments ( usually inexpensive costume pieces or club pins ) from other students and even from those in authority . While at the university , for a time she fell into the sporadic practice of relieving her dates of small amounts of cash she discovered in their pockets during heavy petting . Under such circumstances she also , but more rarely , took a pocketknife or a bunch of keys . During an interval in which she was not in trouble with the faculty , Anna alienated and outraged several girls in the dormitory with whom she had been very friendly . After a few bottles of beer which the group had shared , she entered the rooms occupied by two of these friends and , in their absence , urinated on several evening dresses which they highly valued . ( After the act she refolded the dresses neatly and put them back , sodden and malodorous , in the drawers . ) It was a number of days before evidence emerged that unmistakably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were highly suggestive but not final proof were for a while withheld by those who could not bring themselves to believe Anna capable of such behavior . She easily denied such a possibility to several who spoke with her separately in the hope of finding facts that would exonerate her . She also fabricated evidence to establish her innocence so calmly and so freely that it carried almost axiomatic conviction . On being confronted with plain proof from several sources , she was able to smile off the affair and dismiss it as a whimsical prank . Some felt it was their responsibility as a group to report this incident , but so much was brought out in Anna 's behalf that all finally agreed to let the affair go no further . Concentrating on the long record of her outlandish sexual promiscuity , the most naive observer would perhaps think of " nymphomania " or at least of very powerful erotic drives . Others might surmise that she is and has always been a genitally frigid ( or partially frigid ) woman who finds stimulation but never orgasm ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less consciously to all sorts of indiscretions in a never-ending quest . Neither of these hypotheses seems to account for Anna 's behavior when one becomes familiar with more evidence pertaining to her inner experiences . It seems most probable that this woman has somewhat less than ordinary conscious sexual motivation and that the most significant feature of her sexual experience is that , despite frequent mechanical responses , it has meant so little to her . The localized sensory reaction has not been greatly valued nor has it seemed to play a dominant role in directing her conduct . Anatomic intimacy with man has never been associated with interpersonal relationships of any consequence or duration . Important as this fact may be ( granting that our estimate is in some measure correct ) , it still does not offer a circumscribed area in which a final explanation for Anna 's career can be readily drawn . In every other aspect of social experience also this woman has similarly failed to develop any sort of relationship with another human being that seemed to have much meaning for her or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any consistent , obviously purposive behavior . At forty years of age , during our first interview , Anna absentmindedly checked the preliminary information blank to indicate her status as divorced . She spontaneously changed the pencil mark to show that she was married . As a matter of fact , Anna 's current marriage had lasted a good many years . It is true her husband was such in name only , but he served a practical purpose . The couple had not seen each other or otherwise communicated since shortly after the nuptials , but the legal existence of this union deterred Anna in one aspect of her behavior that had formerly given considerable trouble to her family and their attorneys . Before her last wedding and over a long period , she had fallen into the habit of marrying on impulse apparently as trivial as what might lead another woman to buy a new hat . With one man after another she casually completed the legal ceremonies and entered into this monumental contract , the groom being now an adventurous taxi driver , now an opportunistic bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encountered in her welfare work . The succession of divorces and the repeated financial settlements demanded by vagrants and petty rascals she had on several occasions espoused threatened the family resources . Gratifyingly ( and in contrast with some other cases of similar illness ) , Anna 's marriage series was halted by the prospect of legal bigamy . The husbands of this series were not ( or certainly not usually ) men who took the bride very seriously . This can not be said of her earlier husbands , two of whom were distinguished and wealthy men and , according to the evidence , genuinely and deeply in love with Anna . With one of these , an architect of international repute , she lived for a while in England . To him and almost simultaneously to his wayward brother Anna is said to have given gonorrhea which , as the first year of marriage drew to a close , she inadvertently picked up from a sycophantic interior decorator , a person , according to report , more active homosexually than other-wise- On being detected in activities that would produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely showed simple insouciance . Once at college she did so well for so long that hope returned to her family . Apparently she had found herself at last . After a succession of excellent reports , one showing failures in four subjects appeared . Anna was called on long-distance telephone by her father , who wanted to lose no time in trying to find some remedy for the trouble . Her easy , happy laughter relieved him deeply , even before she had time to go on and explain the mistake that had been made in the dean 's office . She had just heard of it but had not realized the rather comical error had been transmitted to any report that reached him and her mother . Actually she had not realized it was quite time for these reports to be mailed out . She had been , you see , pretty busy  --  but " mighty happy , " too . Warmed within and deeply reassured , he left the telephone completely at ease . Within a few days , sure enough , there came official acknowledgment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused with those of his daughter . The true report was even better than those excellent ones that had been coming regularly now for months . The dean 's signed name and the official school paper and forms would have dispelled any suspicions of fraud had suspicions arisen . Anna 's tone and manner when she spoke over the telephone were such , however , that no doubt at all seemed justified . Soon truly disturbing information came from the school . Not only was Anna failing dismally in all studies , but serious misconduct had brought the question of her expulsion to a crucial point . Wiring his daughter that he was taking the first train , the father also instructed her to make appointments for him with the college authorities . On arriving he found that no appointments had been made . He was entirely unexpected . He was surprised , furthermore , to find that Anna had left for the weekend , after convincing the house mother that she had parental permission to visit an imaginary aunt . Apparently she typed letters and forged signatures to bring off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school stationery and report forms and successfully utilizing these to send back the false reports to her family . On her return after the weekend she seemed surprised to find her father still there and at first expressed vexation at him . He never learned just what misadventures befell his daughter , who had apparently roamed about in a large city nearby . She took all the discussion of her recent acts with equanimity , apologized for her mistakes , and admitted that it was quite inexpedient to bring off such deceptions when it was apparent to her they would certainly and promptly be discovered . She said she did not know precisely why she had acted in such a plainly injudicious way , but she never seemed curious or really concerned about the possibility of discovering a reason for the behavior . Anna did not always emerge unscathed from such adventures . She was badly beaten up in some sort of night spot brawl in St. Louis . On this occasion several of her ribs were fractured , and a lung was punctured ; her brother , who flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injuries would prove fatal . Though occasionally , when drinking , she has taken an active part in slapping or hair-pulling incidents , she has shown little inclination to attack . In similar episodes she rarely initiated gross vocal disputes or was vulgarly aggressive with words . Calmness seemed more characteristic of her than high temper , although it is recorded that in her teens she was expelled from one academy for publicly telling off a school authority in a speech vehemently and versatilely obscene and closing with references anything but flattering to the state of his " third leg . " Many of these incidents , which in isolation appear spectacular , occurred while Anna passed in the community as a reliable , conforming , and extraordinarily attractive woman . Much of the time she seemed poised , polite , and a paragon of happy behavior . For a while during her early twenties she taught a Sunday school class . Her teachings were ethically admirable and she gave a strong impression of sincerity . She often worked for a month or more at a time , efficiently and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other welfare activities . Most who knew her casually in these endeavors would have been genuinely astonished to learn that she had any serious personality problem . Once while hospitalized for a week or ten days , she left the almost universal impression of being a delightful patient . Courteous , composed , undemanding , and cheerful , she took discomforts and minor pains in a way that elicited admiration . During this brief period , in which a benign nodule was surgically removed from her breast , she casually accepted lesbian attentions from a female attendant and also sought to entice an intern . In these enticements she went so far as to get the fly of his trousers open before accepting his determination to refrain . Occasionally during her early thirties , but also a few times since , Anna had engaged in a group sexual pastime . There were minor variations of procedure . Usually drinks with five or six men , whom she might pick up in one of the less inviting honky-tonks or frolic spots about town , constituted the first phase . Later the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual relations with her , each taking his turn . On one such exploit , an argument arose aboutwhether or not she had stolen a cigarette lighter belonging to an escort , and the group , uniting against her , threw Anna in a creek and then drove off , leaving her to walk home . This patient spent a good deal of time reading . In contrast to many psychopaths who readily claim all sorts of entirely imaginary learning , she showed considerable familiarity with literature of many sorts . She seemed to read Shakespearean plays , the major Russian novels , pulp magazines , and comic books with about the same degree of interest . Her factual knowledge about what she had read seemed good , though it must be admitted she often falsified with assurance when questions led her into unknown areas . She played complicated music on the piano with fine technical skill and spent a good deal of time doing so . She had an accurate acquaintance with current scales of intellectual and esthetic fashion and could probably have avoided offense even to the most snide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How she reacted to such matters in the innermost and final chamber of her being can only be surmised . My impression is that King Lear and Amazing Confessions elicited responses in no fundamental way different . There is little I can offer in explanation for the biologic enigma I trust is apparent . In both quantity and quality her emotions , I believe , have regularly fallen short of the affect we almost automatically assume must prompt , accompany , or follow such actions as hers . I will not say that Anna never loved or hated or suffered . I think there was a time when she probably did all of these precociously and beyond ordinary degree . All that , however , is beyond an iron curtain . On this side of the curtain , though she had vexations and minor satisfactions and though she could at times get mad and could be a little fond of people , Anna never really seems to have meant much harm to others or to herself . One of the physicians who had often treated her expressed his bewilderment about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangely she escaped the subjective consequences of her experiences . Taking a phrase from the Russian novel about prostitution , Yenta , to embody his reaction , he said , " All the horror is in just this  --  that there is no horror . " A thoughtful and now elderly member of her family whose advice her parents and one of her early husbands had often sought was particularly impressed with what he described as an unbelievable but somehow authentic innocence that Anna never seemed to lose . Experiences which would harden an ordinary person conspicuously or ensure a conscious cynicism , mordant and profound , seem to fall lightly on her spirit , to leave her surprisingly serene . The person just mentioned , after more than two decades of concern with her problems , finds even more surprising than all the unfortunate acts combined , Anna 's thoughtless assumption that she is to be trusted in all matters , that her behavior has been essentially honorable and ladylike , and the fact that her self-respect is apparently bright and unblemished. n        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
