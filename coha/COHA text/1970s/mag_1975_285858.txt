In a tough little bit of song parody , the Rolling Stones once suggested : " Summer 's here , and the time is right/ For fighting in the streets . " It 's also a prime time on screen for assorted brawls , mysteries , plots , tests of valor and full-fledged battles , as the current crop of thrillers amply demonstrates . <P> THE WIND AND THE LION . A rambunctious , romantic pageant , filled with sentimental splendors , all about a brave Berber bandit ( Sean Connery ) and a beautiful American woman ( Candice Bergen ) of true grit . Writer-Director John Milius has captured both the sweep and the spirit of such classic adventure romances as Four Feathers . <P> <P> FRENCH CONNECTION II . John Frankenheimer 's jolting , street-tough companion piece to William Friedkin 's original , this tune featuring Popeye Doyle ( Gene Hackman ) prowling Marseille , looking for the Frenchman who got away . <P> NIGHT MOVES . Gene Hackman again , this time as a former football player turned private eye trying to graft the pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Arthur Perm 's sometimes sober , sometimes pyrotechnic film is a rather too eager attempt to lift the genre into the realm of metaphysics . <P> THE EIGER SANCTION , by contrast , is straightforward stuff , featuring Clint Eastwood pulling some derring-do on the side of one of Switzerland 's highest mountains . <P> ROLLERBALL , about to open , boasts James Caan in a futuristic speculation in which aggression has been channeled into a single deadly team sport . <P> BREAKOUT is the seasonal visit from Charles Bronson , this time more expansive than usual as a Texas border rat who is hired to bust Robert Duvall out of a Mexican prison . This caper-based on fact-also has the distinction of having inspired a real-life jailbreak in Michigan two weeks ago . Life is not always scrupulous about imitating art , however . The real convicts got caught .
