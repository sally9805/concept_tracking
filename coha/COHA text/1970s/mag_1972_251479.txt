In theory , the lyrics the white boy is singing ought to enrage the audience with their racism and sexism . In theory . <P> <P> Gold Coast slaveship <P> Bound for cotton fields , <P> Sold in a market <P> Down in New Orleans , <P> Scarred old slaver know <P> He 's doin ' all right , <P> Hear him whip the women <P> Just around midnight- <P> But 20 , even ten rows back , the words can scarcely be heard . They exist not as nouns and verbs , but as a physical mass , a hot , indistinct slur like sausage meat : ground out of the famous lips , eaten by the mike , driven into banks of amplifiers and rammed out through two immense blocks of speakers high on either side of the stage . The vowels mix stickily with the air of the auditorium , already saturated by the fume of tens of thousands of packed bodies , the smoke of 50,000 cigarettes and a few pounds of weed , forming an acrid blue vault overhead . <P> The Rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , electric guitars and vast sneering voice ride into another , undifferentiated wave of sound coming at the stage from the hall - the noise of thousands of kids in vicarious heat . Where these two walls of energy meet , above the stage and its blindly waving fringe of teeny-bopper arms , they precipitate a form . It is Mick Jagger , Jumpin ' Jack Flash in person , laced into a white rhinestone-studded jumpsuit and painted like a Babylonian hooker , back-lighted by amber spots and front-lighted by a Mylar mirror the size of a movie screen slung from the roof trusses , belting into the chorus : <P> Ah , Brown Sugah , <P> How come you taste so good ? <P> Aaaah , Brown Sugah , <P> Just like a young girl should . . . <P> <P> When the Stones open at Madison Square Garden in New York on July 24 , it will be the climax of their seventh U.S. tour , which has been , in purely show-biz terms , a vast success .

The chance of getting a ticket over the counter has irrevocably gone . To frustrate scalpers , the tour managers set up a kind of electronic lottery in which supplicants sent postcards six weeks in advance , and the cards were selected at random . The news of this selection process appeared in smallish print at the bottom of the full-page ads in the New York Times , with the result that thousands of Stones fans who did not read it were still pestering the helpless box offices in early July .               @ @ @ @ @ @
