txt In spite of a serious islandwide drought in the last 18 months , Cuba 's 1975 sugar harvest should be a relatively good one . That is the view of both Cuban officials and foreign observers who are well acquainted with the sugar industry , long the mainstay of Cuba 's economy . For their part , Cuban officials refuse to give any estimates on 1975 , worried that such information might have adverse effects on world market prices . But other sources indicate the harvest , now under way , may top 5.5 million tons . It would be at least one million tons more if there had been no drought  --  and this is obviously a source of some disappointment for the Cubans . $2 billion bonanza Yet at today 's world market prices , running at about 50 cents a pound , Cubt will do very well with the 1975 crop . It could moan as much . as a $2 billion bonanza for the Cuban treasury . Prices last year hovered between 8 and 14 cents per pound , whereas four years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // *Cuban sugar harvest ontinued from Page 1 Sugar has always been the main barometer of how well the Cuban economy is doing . It is , as economist Carlos Rafael Rodriguez puts it , " the regulator of our economy . " But there is growing diversification today . Production of nickel , Cuba 's one exportable mineral , is up , as is production of citrus products ? oranges , grapefruit , and other fruits . There has been a marked expansion of industry as well . Economy grows In recent years , the economy has grown significantly . It is up at least 25 percent in the 1970-73 period , with 1974 adding another 8 or 7 percent to the tally . A yearly growth rate of 8 percent is considered likely for the foreseeable future . Moreover , Cuba now ranks among the top two or three nations in Latin America in terms of per capita output , hovering at about $1,000 yearly , a position attained since Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro came to power in 1959 . The high price for sugar on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture , helped also by increased prices for just about everything Cuba produces . At the same time , the improvement results from increased efficiency in the economy . The current sugar harvest will use fewer people than ever before ? due to mechanization . About 200,000 workers will be needed , whereas in the last harvest the manpower total came to 222,000 . Just fbur years ago , it was 400,000 . Plans now aye under way here for a large-scale expansion of nonsugar areas of the economy . This involves boosting present nickel production of 26,000 tons yearly to 100,000 tons in 10 years , expanding tobacco , citrus , fish , and rice production far beyond present levels , and increasing industrial output significantly . In textiles , for example , with the modernization and expansion of plant facilities , the Cubans are counting on taking cloth production from 130 million square meters to 200 million by 1980 and 400 million by 1985 . Cloth production hovered near 70 million square meters in 1970 . Realism ' stressed Dr. Rodriguez is convinced that there has been a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past three years . " Conditions today are much improved , " he says , noting that the economy reached a low point , not only in production , but also in public and official confidence in 1970 . That was after the failure of that year 's sugar harvest to reach a projected goal of 10 million tons . It hit 8.5 million , but only after Herculean efforts that disrupted much of the rest of the economy . Since then , Dr. Rodriguez adds , Cuba has tackled its economic problems " with greater realism . " The result is that the economy today , although still showing weak spots , is much improved over the past . " And we think it is going to get even better , " he concludes .
