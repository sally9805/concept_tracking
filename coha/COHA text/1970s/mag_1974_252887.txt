Oregon State was coming to town for an important game , so U.C.L.A. Center Bill Walton prepared in typical fashion . He began each day with his regular breakfast diet of yogurt , cottage cheese , nuts , cereal , raisins , seeds and honey . He rode his ten-speed bicycle to the beach and contemplated the Pacific . He took his weekly acupuncture treatment : needles in the ears or legs to relieve pain from tendinitis in his knees . On the night before the game , he stayed up until 2 a.m. working on his latest cause-organizing campus opposition to a proposed experimental program for modifying the behavior of criminals by brain surgery . Finally , he put in a half-hour of Transcendental Meditation , chanting his mantra in solitude . <P> William Theodore Walton ( known on his fans ' banners as WILLIAM THE GREAT or WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR ) was ready at last for a little serious basketball . As usual , the vegetarian tiger played as if he had dined on red meat all week ; as if he had slept sweetly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if his knees were made of steel cables ; as if his only icons were the ball and the hoop . <P> Bruin boosters roared their pleasure as their hero gathered in lob passes , then levitated his lanky , 6 ft. 11 in. frame and dropped the ball delicately downward for a basket . At the opposite end of the court , Walton planted himself in front of Oregon State shooters like a giant redwood tree , branches stretching toward the ceiling . Near the end of the game , when Oregon State surged to within three points of U.C.L.A. , Walton responded with a torrent of shots and rebounds that kept the Bruins in the lead . For his efforts that evening early this month : 31 points , 19 rebounds , and an 80-75 U.C.L.A. victory . <P> With that kind of overpowering skill , Walton has become the most successful college athlete of his generation . His achievements , by now , are legion and legend : his team ran up the longest winning streak in college history ( 88 games ) ; counting an unexpected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last Friday night , U.C.L.A. has lost just twice in three years of Walton 's varsity play ; it has won two N.C.A.A. championships and a third is expected next month . Walton himself has a personal won-lost record of 148-2 ( reaching back to his junior year in high school ) , and several multimillion-dollar offers to turn pro after his junior year . Even for Coach John Wooden , who has made winning as common as Los Angeles smog , the Walton era has been sui generis . <P> As if his stats were not enough , Walton , 21 , seems intent on shattering every jock stereotype . He is serious about his studies ( history major , solid B-plus average ) , radical in his politics , reclusive in his lifestyle , contemptuous of money and luxury . So fierce is his sense of individualism that he says that he will not turn pro when he gets his diploma next month unless he can play in Southern California . " Living , " he says , " is more important than playing . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
