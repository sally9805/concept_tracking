It was perhaps the most humiliating incident in the history of the nation 's largest police department . First , New York City Police Commissioner Patrick Murphy announced that 57 lbs . of confiscated heroin was missing from the property-storage room . The next day it developed that an additional 24 Ibs. had disappeared . Estimated illicit retail value : $15 million or more . The cache constituted the bulk of the heroin seized in the 1962 case upon which the film The French Connection was based . <P> All signs pointed to an inside job . <P> A recent lab analysis of the vault 's contents showed that much of the heroin had been replaced by innocuous white powder , while ten pounds had been stolen with no effort at substitution . Murphy promised a tightening of security measures , but he may be closing the barn door after the horse has gone . According to police forms , the officer officially responsible for some of the heroin 's removal ( although there is evidence his signature was forged ) was Detective Joseph Nunziatta , who killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by federal agents . In any event , the caper underscored the archaic inefficiency of police procedures . It showed why local forces have such a difficult time keeping ahead of organized crime , which probably instigated the horse thievery.
