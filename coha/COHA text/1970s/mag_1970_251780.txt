Institutions are so money-hungry that the U.S. is likely to face a chronic shortage of capital throughout the new decade . The pent-up demand for funds - to finance hospitals , schools , airports , highways , pollution control , business enterprises and especially housing-presages a tidal wave of borrowing in the years ahead . Last week the demand reshaped the patterns of saving and borrowing money in two ways . <P> Something for Savers . To help banks and savings-and-loan associations stem a worrisome outflow of funds , the Government raised the maximum interest rates that they can pay to depositors . On ordinary savings accounts , the ceiling went up from 4% to 4% for commercial banks and from 4% to 5% for S &; Ls . At the same time , Washington perpetuated a dubious double standard by which the rich can earn more with their money than can citizens of modest means . Banks and S &; Ls were empowered to pay up to 7% interest on certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more held for a year or longer . For smaller sums , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4% to 6% . <P> The moves were intended to help thrift institutions snare some of the funds that have been going into such enticing outlets as commercial paper ( 8% ) , Government bonds ( 8% ) or Eurodollars ( 9% ) . The chief effect is likely to be a small rise in passbook savings , though such accounts still do not pay enough to make up for the erosion of inflation . <P> Bell Ringer . Even the executives of the world 's biggest company figured that they might have some trouble in raising all the funds that their firm needs from its usual source , the bond market . American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. , therefore , broke with recent tradition in an effort to secure $3.1 billion for the expansion and improvement of its rapidly deteriorating service . Ma Bell offered its giant family of 3,100,000 stockholders a total of $1.57 billion of 30-year debentures , plus warrants entitling them to buy some 31 million A.T . &; T. shares . At last week 's closing price of 481 , the warrants , when exercised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bell package , the largest corporate financing in history , intrigued Wall Street for several reasons . Though the interest rate on the $100 debentures has not yet been set , A.T . &; T. made it clear that the return will be enticing to little savers who are disenchanted with the yields available from savings accounts . The debentures may pay interest in excess of 8% . Because A.T . &; T. is the dowager queen of the investment world , its action promises to make warrants a more popular and respectable way for blue-chip companies to raise money . For years , the New York Stock Exchange has barred trading in warrants on the ground that they are too speculative ; the Big Board may now liberalize that policy .
