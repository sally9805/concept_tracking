Of all the diseases to which women are susceptible , few are more devastating than breast cancer . This year alone the disease will affect 70,000 American women and kill 30,000 . Doctors who have tried for decades to determine the cause now have strong evidence that a principal villain is a virus . Researchers in the U.S. and India have found high concentrations of virus-like particles in the milk of women with family histories of breast cancer . Equally important , according to an article published in the British scientific journal Nature , they have found that these particles are indistinguishable from viruses known to cause cancer in animals . <P> The findings represent a major medical discovery . They raise the possibility that doctors might one day be able to immunize women against breast cancer . Doctors have known since 1936 that the Bittner virus can cause cancer in laboratory mice ; they learned in 1969 that similar particles could also be found in human milk . It was not until early this year that a direct correlation between the virus-like particles and a familial history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What provided the clue was a study by Bombay Drs . S.M. Sirsat , J.C . Paymaster and A.B . Vaidya of the Parsis , descendants of the Zoroastrians who fled Persia 1,200 years ago , settled in India and married exclusively within their own sect . Parsi women are three times more likely to develop breast cancers than the rest of the Indian population . Nearly 40% of the Parsi mothers studied showed virus-like particles in their milk . <P> The prevalence of such particles is hardly unique to the Parsis . In a study undertaken to test the relevance of the Indian team 's findings , Biophysicist Dan Moore and his colleagues at the Institute for Medical Research in Camden , N.J. , analyzed milk from 166 American women . Of 156 with no family history of breast cancer , only seven ( 5% ) showed evidence of the particles in their milk . But of ten women whose families had a history of the disease , six ( 60% ) were found to harbor large numbers of the particles . Doctors are still reluctant to state flatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have been unable as yet to identify particles in a human tumor . But Moore has found that serum from humans who have had breast cancer can have a neutralizing effect on the mouse virus when the serum is injected into mice .
