The President/Hugh Sidey <P> There have been moments along the difficult presidential journey of Jimmy Carter when he seemed close to fulfilling his own prophecy that he could " achieve greatness . " He recognized the gravity of the energy problem early . He had the courage to see the peril of inflation and change his course . In the glades of Camp David , when his goodness , his determination and his sincerity brought Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat together for peace , Carter seemed ready to move beyond historical inhibitions . <P> His sudden decision to normalize relations with China was another bold stroke beyond convention . His skillful orchestration of the Vienna summit , his firm but tender treatment of the ailing Leonid Brezhnev , appeared to signal that he was now trained and toughened and on the brink of stepping out of mediocrity . <P> But last week , as he had before , Carter seemed to falter and slip back , hesitant and uncertain about how to lead this nation into a future that grows darker each day . The chilling conclusion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : he may not be up to the challenge . It is plain that he has mastered the details of the problems , come to appreciate the role of Congress , learned better the realities of a dangerous world . But taking that knowledge and fashioning from it a call to peaceful arms eludes him . A growing number of both politicians and scholars believe that because of the energy and economic crises , this nation needs a kind of revolution in thought and way of life . The principal executive of such an effort of inspiration and organization must be the President . Yet the size of the challenge and the power he has at his command seem too great for his comprehension- or use . <P> The American people are coming to the same conclusion about Jimmy Carter . Richard Scammon , an expert in the analysis of public opinion , finds the Harris and Gallup polls that show Carter now running behind Republicans Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford " the worst thing that has happened in his presidency . " Ratings of " approval " often rise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early in the political season , Scammon believes that the problem of an incumbent reaches beyond politics to the popular perception of the man . <P> If history is a guide , there really is no one who can tell Carter how he should lead . It must come from within him . That is the worry . He has little sense of history , nor has he proved himself to be an imaginative man . These may be fatal flaws .
