THE DANCE OF DEATH by AUGUST STRINDBERG <P> In Strindberg 's obsession , any relationship between the sexes tended to take on the character of a Hundred Years ' War-there might be some redemptive moments , some victories , but mostly it would be nasty , brutish and nearly interminable . Marriage became a sort of ugly paradigm of the human condition . <P> The Dance of Death is one of the most concentrated visions of unmitigated nastiness ever staged . Edward , a drunken , boorish army captain , lives with his venomous wife Alice in an island fortress off the bleak coast of Sweden . Bills go unpaid , the paint peels , and their children-small wonder-avoid them . They approach their silver wedding anniversary with only an astonished resentment that each could have deprived the other of so much of life . <P> Strindberg wrote The Dance of Death in two parts ; as is becoming customary with this play , Director AJ . Antoon is staging only the first part in this production at Manhattan 's Lincoln Center . Despite a distinguished cast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of performance . It mixes rage and exhaustion the way old club fighters hack away and then fall into each other 's clinch , softly drubbing the kidneys , to rest for a little while . ( A few years ago , Friedrich Duerrenmatt staged The Dance of Death literally as a boxing match . ) <P> Dark Laughter . Robert Shaw as the bullet-headed lout begins by screaming something as subtle as " Shut up , for Christ 's sake ! " Zoe Caldwell asks with a desperate pleading , " Oh , when is he going to die ? " Starting at such a level of anger , it is difficult for the players to find much new emotional territory to cover , and they do not . Strindberg intended moments of dark laughter in The Dance of Death , but the audience laughs with a bewildered edginess , as if not quite sure that it should . <P> One imagines that a couple hatefully married for 25 years , rather than bludgeoning each other with such sullen insults , would have developed between them an immense repertory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in this play 's descendant , Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? , the couple would know precisely where to strike to draw blood . As it is , Alice simply calls Edward a " miserable old wart hog " and a " fiend , " as if she had long since despaired of finding anything more imaginative to say . The Dance , at last , is little more than a gray and rather disagreeable marathon . <P> L.M.
