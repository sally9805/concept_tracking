Female journalists last week made waves in politics , courtrooms and White House society : <P> JUDY JOINS THE NON-GUESTS <P> Ever since she broke the ban on press coverage by crashing the wedding reception of Julie Nixon and David Eisenhower in 1968 , Washington Post Reporter-Columnist Judith Martin , 32 , has been on bad terms with the White House . Just how bad became apparent last week when she was barred from covering Tricia Nixon 's White House wedding next month . " The First Family , " sniffed Mrs. Nixon 's staff director , Connie Stuart , " does not feel comfortable with Judith Martin . " <P> A Wellesley graduate with an acerb tongue and typewriter , Judy has been tough on Tricia in the past , once observing of her little-girl look : " A 24-year-old woman dressed like an ice cream cone can give even neatness and cleanliness a bad name . " <P> Post executives appealed to the White House , got nowhere , and defiantly decided that instead of assigning six reporters to cover the wedding as originally planned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll get as near as I can and cover as well as I can , " says Judy , who has been promised help from friends inside to " keep me informed . " <P> ROSE ROCKS THE BOAT <P> Ronald Reagan has been telling his California constituents that " taxes should hurt . " Now , one of the more intriguing and potentially damaging political stories of the year is that he paid no state income tax at all in 1970 ( because of business reverses ) . Disclosure came through a most unlikely channel : a gossipy item broadcast on the student radio station at Sacramento State College by a 29-year-old widowed mother of three who is studying journalism there and was on the air only to fill a course requirement . <P> Rose King apparently exercised no particular journalistic skill in getting the story , and professes surprise at the storm that blew up following her broadcast over KERS-FM . " I really did n't think anybody was listening , " she says with a chuckle . " I did n't see the tax return myself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from several sources , and I was convinced they were reliable . " <P> A Democratic worker , Rose insists she would have used the item regardless of Reagan 's political affiliation . Her scoop has brought Rose several feelers for newspaper jobs when she graduates from Sacramento State next year , but it has also put her on the spot . Under <P> California law , disclosure of tax information is a crime punishable by six months in jail and a $500 fine . " I wo n't tell you anything about where I got my information , " she told a tax investigator . " That is my privilege as a journalist . " In her refusal , she relies on another state law protecting reporters from being forced to reveal their sources . <P> FELICITY FIGHTS BACK <P> Like many campus newspapers , the Stanford Daily has found that covering radical violence and student demonstrations is a thankless trip through no man 's land . One Daily photographer was threatened by radicals for taking their pictures ; two days later he was Maced by police . Recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searched the Daily 's files in a fruitless hunt for pictures of the protesters .
