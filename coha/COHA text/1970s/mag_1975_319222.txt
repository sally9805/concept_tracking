There are books of which the backs and covers are by far the best parts . <P> - Charles Dickens <P> Especially children 's books . At the Christmas season hundreds of new volumes beckon , each with an appealing dust jacket , each with the promise of juvenile delight . It is only upon close examination that the fantasy turns out to be a dream of Ebenezer Scrooge : volumes shaped like rabbits , turtles-everything but books ; " relevant " accounts of crime and strife ; the latest data on the making of babies-but little about the meaning of love . Still , along the shelves a few items always glitter-works that will be read and reread long after the backs and covers are coated with crayon , spilled milk , tears and time . <P> In Anno 's Alphabet ( Crowell ; $6.95 ) , Artist Mitsumasa Anno exhibits a gifted mind as well as hand . Twenty-six illustrations mount ingenious optical illusions in the shape of letters ( see story head above-c 1974 by Fukuinkan-Sho-ten ) ; on the opposite pages are objects beginning with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertains and instructs in the best alphabet book of the year . <P> For Pezzettino ( Pantheon ; $4.95 ) , Leo Lionni manages a feat of Klee : his collages and swirls of paint evoke the sensations of childhood . Pezzettino is a minuscule symbol , and all his friends are large , adventurous ones-until the boy sails off to the isle of Wham . The result is a pleasing metaphor for growing pains , and a consolation for that temporary period when the very young are dwarfed by parents , siblings , and sometimes life itself . <P> " Every child must have something to ignore/ And that 's what parents were created for . " So observed Ogden Nash , and as if in agreement , Mercer Mayer has produced Two More Moral Tales ( Four Winds ; $3.50 ) . No adult is needed to explain these textless jokes about pigs who put on elaborate evening wear and then head for mud , or about a venal fox who sells fur coats that are still alive . The Chicken 's Child , by Margaret A. Hartelius ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidentally hatches an alligator egg . The green baby thereupon eats corn , pies , wash-tubs and tractors , yet still manages to win himself an honored place on the farm and in the child 's library . <P> Parents are back in style in three books of poems for the young . John Lawrence 's Rabbit &; Pork : Rhyming Talk ( Crowell ; $6.95 ) revives the old cockney custom of jingling euphemisms : " Johnny Homer " to mean corner . By means of fine-lined wood engravings , Lawrence invests each miniverse with whimsy and bite ( from " Inky Smudge " : Judge , to " Noah 's Ark " : Park ) ; his pageant of animals educates almost as much as it amuses . Perhaps the most diverting beast of the season is the dragon of Magic in the Mist ( Atheneum ; $4.95 ) . Margaret Mary Kimmel 's happy reptile-illustrated by Trina Schart Hyman-is the best igniter since the match .
