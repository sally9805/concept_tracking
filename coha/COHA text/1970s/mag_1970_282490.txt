Shortly after he took charge of the Rockefeller Foundation 's wheat-improvement program in Mexico 26 years ago , a young American plant pathologist named Norman E. Borlaug began a momentous series of cross-breeding experiments . With the germ plasm of plants from four different countries , he succeeded in developing a remarkable new kind of wheat that was able to flourish in all of Mexico 's widely varied growing conditions . His work quickly put Mexico on the road to self-sufficiency in wheat production . But it had an even more important result : it sowed the seeds of the Green Revolution-a quantum jump in agricultural progress . <P> Last week , as the man most responsible for that jump , the onetime Iowa farm boy was awarded the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize . Characteristically , Borlaug was in the wheatfields near Atizapn , Mexico , when he heard the news about the $78,000 prize . " Somebody has made a mistake , " he insisted . When he was finally convinced , he delayed meeting reporters until he had completed his day 's work : carefully checking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triple dwarf " wheat . <P> Visit to India . The experimental plants were , in fact , descendants of the original strains that Borlaug had bred for his crusade against famine . Undisturbed by any scientific breeding techniques , wheat in tropical countries had evolved over the centuries into tall , thin-stemmed strains able to survive flooding and compete successfully with weeds for sunlight . But they are highly vulnerable to modern fertilizers , which cause them to become top-heavy with grain and topple over . To overcome that problem , Borlaug collected samples of a Japanese dwarf strain that had already been improved by a U.S. Agriculture Department scientist named Orville Vogel and crossed it with native Mexican wheat and other strains with desirable qualities . By growing them in both the hot , parched fields of northern Mexico and the higher , cooler regions near Mexico City , Borlaug eventually succeeded in producing a totally new strain . It was one that was hardy , resistant to toppling , and also well suited to Mexico 's diverse climates and soils . <P> In 1963 , while on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracle " wheat could be planted there as well . As a result , India is now on the verge of producing enough wheat to meet its own needs . Neighboring West Pakistan , also a recipient of the miracle wheat , has already achieved that goal . Indeed , the Rockefeller and Ford foundations were so elated by Borlaug 's work that they joined forces in establishing a similar international program for rice improvement headquartered in the Philippines . <P> Tanned and rugged-looking , the 56-year-old grandfather still travels the globe , constantly preaching the cause of the Green Revolution ( and also of birth control ) . Despite his evangelical zeal , however , he seems happiest at home in Mexico . After one recent trip , during which he visited a dozen countries in almost as many days , he arrived back at his farm late at night and looked at the cloudless sky . " It 's a wonderful moonlit night , " he told his haggard companions . Then , after seeing them off to bed , he stayed up until dawn , inspecting his fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
