John W. Gardner , the founding chairman of Common Cause and formerly Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare , sees danger in certain proposals that have come forth lately from various tax reformers to eliminate or reduce the charitable contributions that Americans can deduct from taxable income . He stated his case recently at a United Way conference in a speech on which this essay is based : <P> " These Americans are a peculiar people . If , in a local community , a citizen becomes aware of a human need which is not being met , he thereupon discusses the situation with his neighbors . Suddenly a committee comes into existence . The committee thereupon begins to operate on behalf of the need and a new community function is established . It is like watching a miracle , because these citizens perform this act without a single reference to any bureaucracy , or any official agency . " <P> Just so , 150 years ago , Tocqueville described a unique feature of the American system . It is the spontaneous working of a creative public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such vitally important institutions as libraries , museums , civic organizations , great universities , the United Way , the Little Leagues , the Salvation Army , symphony orchestras , garden clubs , historical societies , adoption services , hospitals , religious organizations , Alcoholics Anonymous , the 4-H clubs . Indeed , this American spirit reaches into almost every field of human interest . Tied to another powerful American tradition - that of private giving for public purposes-the volunteer spirit has released incredible human energy and commitment in behalf of community all over the country . <P> Yet in the next two or three years the Federal Government may destroy this feature of the American system . The destruction could be accomplished silently and invisibly-in the name of tax reform . The threat lies in proposals that would reduce , directly and indirectly , the charitable contributions Americans itemize as deductions from taxable income . And there are even those who , with the intent of simplifying the tax code , would eliminate such deductions entirely . With due respect to the reformers , the alarm should be shouted : Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of their good intentions . <P> Up till now , Government tax policy has deliberately fostered that tradition . The deductibility of charitable gifts is based on the idea that it is good for a great many people , independently , privately , to contribute to charitable , religious , scientific and educational activities of their choice . Such giving supports the American pluralism that allows all kinds of people to take the initiative in all kinds of activities . In reality , the tradition that has produced the innumerable institutions that are sometimes called the nonprofit sector lies at the very heart of our intellectual and spiritual strivings . The deductibility of charitable donations has been only an expression of that larger philosophy .
