txt The United States , the Soviet Union , France , and Britain are pumping arms and military know-how into the Middle East area at an unprecedented pace . Specialists here estimate that Mideast governments , especially Iran , Saudi Arabia , Israel , Libya , Egypt . Syria , and Iraq , may well double their 1974 military expenditures to around $40 billion in 1975 . Instructors and technicians , especially from the Soviet Union and the United States , are moving in with the giant arms packages . Some current examples are about 1,500 Soviet military personnel in the northeast African state of Somalia and more than 1,000 in Syria ; 1,500 U.S. civilian and660 U.S. military personnel in Iran , and somewhat fewer American military in Saudi Arabia . The Vinnell Corporation of Los Angeles has a controversial contract , under U.S. congressional investigation , for 1,000 more U.S. civilian veterans to train the Saudi National Guard . Still more U.S personnel are expected shortly in Kuwait to accompany more than 30 A-4 Skyhawk aircraft as well as Superhawk antiaircraft missiles and transport vehicles purchased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new U.S. military-aid program there . Assignment of McDonnell-Douglas Aircraft Corporation technicians for the Skyhawks and Raytheon Corporation specialists for the Superhawkmissiles are believed to be part of the Kuwait deal . Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat expelled some 15,000 Soviet military personnel from Egypt in July , 1972 , and never readmitted them , despite the October , 1973 , war with Israel . But resumption of Soviet arms shipments now is reported in Egypt . Inevitably , say Arab military analysts , this will involve return of at least several hundred Soviet personnel to Egypt . News agencies in Cairo quoted Egyptian Foreign Minister Ismail Fahmy as telling an Egyptian parliamentary committee Feb. 18 that Egypt would not go back to the Mideast peace talks in Geneva until its arms losses of October , 1973 , are replaced either by the Soviets or by other sources . Losses replaced The Israeli Chief of Staff , Gen. Mordecai Gur , said in an Israel radio interview that Egypt had received Soviet-made weapons from Libya recently . Israeli Defense Minister Shimon Peres told the Israeli Knesset ( Parliament ) that Libya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tanks , fighter planes , and ground-to-air missiles . He added that delivery began last summer . Israel 's 1973 war losses in aircraft , tanks , artillery , and missiles have been replaced by the United States . // *Mideast awash in weaponry // Though Egypt has been shopping and Syria has shown interest in Western arms ? Egypt has received some French Mirage-3 fighters and Saudi Arabia has purchased , possibly for Egypt , large quantities of the more advanced Mirage F-1 for delivery in 1978-79 ? neither country seems able to make a major switch to the West . Egyptian and Syrian miliraty men have said it would take something like 10 years , far too long for either to consider , to convert to Western arms . Huge arms buildup Iran 's huge arms buildup in the Persian Gulf , involving some $4 billion in purchases from the U.S. last year , has aggravated the shortage of skilled manpower in Iran . Some 700,000 foreign workers have been recruited . Among some of the U.S. training activities there are management for Iran Aircraft Industries and training in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gen. Delk Oden , former commander of the U.S. Army Aviation Center and president of Bell Helicopter Company , which has sold Iran nearly 500 helicopters since 1973 . A recent U.S. General Accounting Office report showed that this high-level U.S. support for Iran has led to many key military skills being in " critical short supply " within the U.S.
