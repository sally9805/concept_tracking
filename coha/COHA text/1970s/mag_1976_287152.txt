Amid glowing pledges to promote ' ' better relations among nations , " 35 heads of government gathered in the capital of Finland one year ago this week to sign a document that a small army of negotiators had taken two years to prepare . Today the vaunted Helsinki agreement remains what it was from the start : more ceremony than substance . There has been so little improvement in East-West relations that can be credited to the accord that the spirit of Helsinki has become increasingly dispirited . <P> The anniversary is being observed enthusiastically enough in the Soviet Union , which is celebrating the occasion with special television programs , endless newspaper articles and the publication of a book . After all , the Russians were the original sponsors of Helsinki , and their dominance of Eastern Europe and the Baltic states , a fact for more than a generation , was legitimized by the accord . This kind of quasi-juridical sanction had long been a major goal of Kremlin foreign policy . <P> Unfounded Fears . In the West , and most notably the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his political year lexicon , the anniversary is being all but ignored . One reason is that some of NATO 's initial hesitations have been justified : the gains of Communists in Southern Europe are partly attributable to the post-Helsinki mood , in which the threat of international Communism has appeared to be further diminished . Yet the West 's main fear , that a Helsinki-inspired euphoria would lead to sharp cutbacks in defense spending by NATO nations , seems so far to have been unfounded . <P> In return for the West 's ratification of Soviet post-1945 territorial gains , Moscow and its allies had to pledge , among other things , increased East-West cultural and human contacts . Cultural exchanges have indeed burgeoned , as measured by the rising East-West traffic in groups involved in sports , art and other fields , and tourism within the Soviet Union is being expanded . But Western scorekeepers fault the Soviets in other areas , notably human rights , including the treatment of political dissidents and would-be emigrants . Although the Kremlin has cut the price of emigration visas by onefourth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissidents and relatives of those outside to emigrate , people who apply for the visas are usually penalized immediately by a loss of their jobs . <P> After a period of petulance over criticism of its record on human rights , Moscow early this year switched to a policy of visible compliance with Helsinki through what are known in diplomatic parlance as " small steps , " such as eased travel restrictions on foreign newsmen and inviting Western observers to Soviet military exercises . More recently , the Soviets have been marking time on new Helsinki initiatives of their own , while rapping Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe , which broadcast into Russia and Eastern Europe , and Washington 's public opposition to Communist participation in Western European governments , as violations of the Helsinki pledge of noninterference in other countries ' affairs . Another complaint : the difficulty European Communists have in visiting the U.S. Concedes one U.S. official : " Our self-righteous position is not as credible as we 'd like to think .
