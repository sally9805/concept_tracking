txt Both China and the Soviet Union ? the first and third most populous lands on earth ? have a growing hunger this year for US grains . Bad weather has shriveled crop hopes in the two Communist giants , sending signals of need and distress radiating from Moscow and Peking . One such signal , according to experts , is a pattern of gold sales early this year indicating that the Soviets , and perhaps the Chinese , were selling gold to earn dollars to buy American and other foreign grain . " The Soviets , " said one gold expert , " always have been shrewd in the way they liquidate sell gold , dribbling it out in small quantities well in advance of the time they will need the money . " // From page 1 China , USSR grain In February , March , and April of this year , the specialist said , gold in world markets was selling in a " very narrow margin " of $230 to $250 an ounce . Something was holding gold from going higher . That something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emanating in part from the Soviet Union , perhaps from China . The Soviets and Chinese , he said , sell gold primarily through the Zurich market and , given the " close-mouthed Swiss , " it is hard to pin down details . That late-winter time frame , grain specialists concur , coincided with the realization by Soviet and Chinese officials that their needs for grain imports this year would be vast . Since that time gold prices have shot up ? $278.80 was the June 14 morning quote in London ? reflecting , among other things , smaller supplies offered by the International Monetary Fund , the US Treasury , and , probably , experts say , by the Soviets and Chinese . With their money in hand , in other words , the governments in Moscow and Peking are shopping for grain , with the US a prime supplier . Already in this third crop year of a five-year US-Soviet grain agreement , said Michael Hall , president of Great Plains Wheat , Inc. , the Russians have bought 10 million tons of grain ? 2.5 million of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The US Government , as it did in the second year of the agreement , is allowing the Soviets to buy up to 15 million tons . Already , according to Mr. Hall , Soviet officials are exploring a 15-million-ton ceiling for the fourth crop year , beginning next Oct. 1 . For grain in excess of 15 million tons , Soviet officials must notify the US Department of Agriculture of needs and purchasing intentions . The USSR , with its commitment to the Soviet people of greater meat supplies , wants regular access to US grain markets . American farmers need to sell surplus wheat and corn . US farm sales overseas do much to cut the chronic American trade deficit . Against this background , both sides describe their periodic grain talks as cordial and cooperative , whatever may be the strained status on other issues . China , projecting a 43-million-ton wheat crop this year , was beset by the same bad winter and spring weather conditions that reduced Soviet crops . Chinese officials say they hope to buy 6 million tons of grain from the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the next three years . China buys more wheat than corn from the United States , the reverse of the Soviet buying pattern . In the period 1972-74 , China bought substantial quantities of US grains , then dropped out of the market , getting its foreign supplies from Canada , Australia , and Argentina . Last year the Peking government looked again to the United States as a " residual " supplier . If the Chinese do , in fact , buy 6 million tons of American wheat and corn , the US will become the prime foreign food supplier to their nearly 1 billion people . Food imports of this magnitude  --  from the US , Canada , and Australia  --  will drain Chinese foreign-exchange reserves , reducing investment possibilities in industrial fields . A steadily growing population  --  though at a slower rate than hitherto  --  has led Chinese authorities to admit that many of their people today have less grain to eat than 20 years ago . This chronic need , coupled with bad crop conditions in the northern wheatlands this year , sends the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
