DOCTOR BRODIE 'S REPORT <P> by JORGE LUIS BORGES <P> 128 pages . Dutton. $5.95 . <P> <P> Borges ' best previous stories were strange , dreamlike fables that cast an oblique , ironic light on the doings of this world . In this latest group , the world is all too much with the author . These are mostly plain , unadorned tales-some harsh , some tender-of love , hate and the inevitability of death . In his preface , Borges admits giving up the " surprises inherent in a baroque style . Now , having passed 70 , I believe I have found my own voice . " Or is it , he asks himself , only the " fruit of weariness " ? <P> The characters of these stories are the sort of people Borges grew up with in Argentina , the heroes and villains of the legends he was taught as a child . They are assorted freebooters and roustabouts who subsist precariously on the edge of civilization . Resigned as they are to a grim fate , the world holds no surprises for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The End of the Duel , two gauchos who hate each other are conscripted into the same army and taken prisoner by a malicious prankster who orders them to run a race after their throats have been slit . The winner never knows he has won . <P> At his advanced age , Borges is a master at describing people who have come to the end of their world and their dreams . One engaging story , The Elder Lady , concerns an old woman who has not ventured out of her house in Buenos Aires since 1921 . " The last pleasures left her , " writes Borges , " would be those of memory and , later on , of forgetfulness . She recounted historical happenings , but always using the same words in the same order , as if they were the Lord 's Prayer , so that I grew to suspect there were no longer any real images behind them . Even eating one thing or another was all the same to her . She was , in short , happy . " <P> The pick of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partial return to the dream kingdoms of the earlier works . With powerful brevity , Borges limns a decadent nation where language-and all that it implies of hope and beauty - is the execrated enemy . Disdaining vowels , Borges ' updated Yahoos grunt only in consonants . When they want to open what passes for a conversation , they fling mud . Their king is protected from mortal corruption by being blinded and castrated . <P> The most esteemed figure among them is the poet . " Six or seven words , generally enigmatic , may come to a man 's mind . He can not contain himself and shouts them out . If the poem does not stir people , nothing comes to pass ; but if the poet 's words strike them , they all draw away without a sound , under the command of a holy dread . Now he is a man no longer but a god , and anyone has license to kill him . "
