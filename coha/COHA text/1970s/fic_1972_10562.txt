The latter had evinced no surprise that he should be asked to fly to Vienna in three hours . He had quietly packed an overnight case , and the pair of them had taken a taxi to Heathrow Airport . The Englishman had calmly produced a roll of notes enough to buy two return tickets for cash after the Frenchman had admitted he had not thought of paying cash and had only brought his passport and a checkbook . Since then they had hardly exchanged a word . The Englishman had not asked where they were going in Vienna , or whom they were to meet , or why , which was just as well because the Frenchman did not know . His instructions had merely been to telephone back from Londonairport and confirm his arrival on the BEA flight , at which he was told to report to General Information on arrival at Schwechat . All of which made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside him , far from helping , made things worse . At the information desk in the main hall he gave his name to the pretty Austrian girl , who searched in a rack of pigeon-holes behind her , then passed him a small buff message form . It said simply " Ring 61.44.03 , ask for Schulze . " He turned and headed towards the bank of public phones along the back of the main hall . The Englishman tapped him on the shoulder and pointed at the booth marked Wechsel . " You 'll need some coins , " he said in fluent French . " Not even the Austrians are that generous . " The Frenchman blushed and strode towards the money-change counter , while the Englishman sat himself comfortably in the corner of one of the upholstered settees against the wall and lit another king-size English filter . In a minute his guide was back with several Austrian bank-notes and a handful of coins . The Frenchman went to the telephones , found an empty booth , and dialled . At the other end Herr Schulze gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few seconds , then the phone went dead . The young Frenchman came back to the settee , and the blond man looked up at him . " On y va ? " he asked . " On y va . " As he turned to leave , the Frenchman screwed up the message form with the telephone number and dropped it on the floor . the Englishman picked it up , opened it out , and held it to the flame of his lighter . It blazed for an instant and disappeared in black crumbs beneath the elegant suede boot . They walked in silence out of the building and hailed a taxi . The centre of the city was ablaze with lights and choked with cars , so it was not until forty minutes later that the taxi arrived at the Pension Kleist . " This is where we part . I was told to bring you here , but to take the taxi somewhere else . You are go straight up to Room Sixty-four . You are expected . " The Englishman nodded and got out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Drive on , " he said , and the taxi disappeared down the street . The Englishman glanced up at the old Gothic writing on the street name-plate , then the square roman capitalsabove the door of the Pension Kleist . Finally he threw away his cigarette , half smoked , and entered . The clerk on duty had his back turned , but the door creaked . Without giving any sign of approaching the desk , the Englishman walked towards the stairs . The clerk was about to ask what he wanted when the visitor glanced in his direction , nodded casually as to any other menial , and said firmly , " Guten Abend . " " Guten Abend , mein Herr , " replied the clerk automatically , and by the time he had finished the blond man was gone , taking the stairs two at a time without seeming to hurry . At the top he paused and glanced down the only corridor available . At the far end was Room 68 . He counted back down the corridor to what must be 64 , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door of 64 were twenty feet of corridor , t he walls being studded on the right by two other doors before 64 , and on the left a small alcove partially curtained with red velours hanging from a cheap brass rod . He studied the alcove carefully . From beneath the curtain , which cleared the floor by four inches , the toe of a single black shoe emerged40 / / 411111 I ) AY 01 ' ' 1 I1 P. JACKALslightly Ile turned and walked back to the foyer . This time the clerk was ready At least he managed to get his mouth open. " ( let me Room Sixty-four please , " said the Englishman . The clerk looked him in the face for a second , then obeyed . After a few seconds he turned hack from the small switchboard , picked up the desk phone , and passed it over . " If that gorilla is not out of the alcove in fifteen seconds I am going hack home , " said the blond man , and put the phone down . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the door of 64 open and Colonel Rodin appeared . He stared down the corridor for a moment at the Englishman , then called softly , " Viktor . " From the alcove the giant Pole emerged and stood looking from one to the other . Rodin said , " It 's all right . He is expected . " Kowalski glowered . The Englishman started to walk . Rodin ushered him inside the bedroom . It had been arranged like an office for a recruiting board . The escritoire served for the chairman'sdesk and was littered with papers . Behind it was the single upright chair in the room . But two other uprights brought in from adjacent rooms flanked the central chair , and these were occupied by Montclair and Casson , who eyed the visitor curiously . There was no chair in front of the desk . The Englishman cast an eye around , selectedone of the two easy chairs and spun it around to face the desk . By the time Rodin had given fresh instructions to Viktor and closed the door , the Englishman was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rodin took his seat behind the desk . For a few seconds he stared at the man from London . What he saw did not displease him , and he was an expert in men . The visitor stood above six feet tall , apparently in his early thirties , and with a lean , athletic build . He looked fit , the suntanned face had regular but not remarkable features , and the hands lay quietly along the arms of the chair . To Rodin 's eye he looked like a man who retained control of himself . But the eyes bothered him . He had seen the soft , moist eyes of weaklings , the dull , shuttered eyes of psychopaths , and the watchfuleyes of soldiers . The eyes of the Englishman were open and staredAnatomy of a Plotback with frank candor . Except for the irises , which were of flecked grey so that they seemed smoky like the hoar mist on a winter 's morning . It took Rodin a few seconds to realise that they had no expression at all . Whatever thoughts did go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rodin felt a worm of unease . Like all men created by systems and procedures , he did not like the unpredictableand therefore the uncontrollable . " We know who you are , " he began abruptly . " I had better introducemyself . I am Colonel Marc Rodin  --  " " I know , " said the Englishman , " you are chief of operations of the OAS . You are Major Rene Montclair , treasurer , and you are MonsieurAndre Casson , head of the underground in the Metropole . " He stared at each of the men in turn as he spoke , and reached for a cigarette . " You seem to know a lot already , " interjected Casson as the three watched the visitor light up . The Englishman leaned back and blew out the first stream of smoke . " Gentlemen , let us be frank . I know what you are , and you know what I am . We both have unusual occupations . You are hunted while I am free to move where I will without surveillance . I operate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to practical details , we are all professionals at our jobs . Therefore we do not need to fence . You have been making enquiries about me . It is impossible to make such enquiries without the news of them soon getting back to the man being asked about . Naturally I wished to know who was so interested in me . It could have been someone seeking revenge or wishing to employ me . It was important to me to know . As soon as I discovered the identity of the organisation interested in me , two days among the French newspaper files in the British Museum were enough to tell me about you and your organisation . So the visit of your little errand boy this afternoon was hardly a surprise . Bon . I know who you are , and whom you represent . What I would like to know is what you want . " There was silence for several minutes . Casson and Montclair glanced for guidance at Rodin . The paratroop colonel and the assassin stared at each other . Rodin knew enough about violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J A C K A Lstand the man facing him was what he wanted . From then on Montclairand Casson were part of the furniture . " Since you have read the files available , I will not bore you with the motivations behind our organisation , which you have accurately summed up as idealism . We believe France is now ruled by a dictator who has polluted our country and prostituted its honour . We believe his regime can only fall and France be restored to Frenchmen if he first dies . Out of six attempts by our supporters to eliminate him , three were exposed in the early planning stages , one was betrayed the day before the attempt , and two took place but misfired . " We are considering , but at this stage only considering , engaging the services of a professional to do the job . However we do not wish to waste our money . The first thing we would like to know is if it is possible . " Rodin had played his cards shrewdly . The last sentence , to which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the grey eyes . " There is no man in the world who is proof against an assassin 's bullet , " said the Englishman . " De Gaulle 's exposure rate is very high . Of course , it 's possible to kill him . The point is that the chances of escape would not be too high . A fanatic prepared to die himself in the attempt is always the most certain method of eliminating a dictator who exposes himself to the public . I notice , " he added with a touch of malice , " that despite your idealism you have not yet been able to produce such a man . Both Pont-de-Seine and Petit-Clamart failed because no one was prepared to risk his own life to make absolutely certain . " " There are patriotic Frenchmen prepared even now  --  " began Cassonhotly , but Rodin silenced him with a gesture . The Englishman did not even glance at him . " And as regards a professional ? " prompted Rodin . " A professional does not act out of fervour and is therefore more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being idealistic , he is not likely to have second thoughts at the last minute about who else might get hurt in the explosion , or whatever method , and beingAnatomy of a Plota professional he has calculated the risks to the last contingency . So his chances of success on schedule are surer than anyone else , but he will not even enter into operation until he has devised a plan that will enable him not only to complete the mission , but to escape un-harmed . " " Do you estimate that such a plan could be worked out to permit a professional to kill Grand Zohra and escape ? " The Englishman smoked quietly for a few minutes and stared out of the window . " In principle , yes , " he replied at length . " In principle , it is always possible with enough time and planning . But in this case it would be extremely difficult . More so than with most other targets . " " Why more than others ? " asked Montclair . " Because de Gaulle is forewarned  --  not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All big men have bodyguards and security men , but over a period of years without any serious attempt on the life of the big man , the checks become formal , the routines mechanical , and the degree of watchfulness is lowered . The single bullet that finishes the target is wholly unexpected and therefore provokes panic . Under cover of this the assassin escapes . In this case there will be no lowering of the level of watchfulness , no mechanical routines , and if the bullet were to get to the target , there would be many who would not panic but would go for the assassin . It could be done , but it would be one of the hardest jobs in the world at this moment . You see , gentlemen , your own efforts have not only failed but have queered the pitch for everyone else . " " In the event that we decide to employ a professional assassin to do this job  --  " began Rodin . " You have to employ a professional , " cut in the Englishman quietly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would be prepared to do the job out of purely patriotic motives . " " Yes , there are still Watin and Curutchet , " replied the blond man . " And doubtless there are more Degueldres and Bastien-Thirys around somewhere . But you three men did not call me here for a chat in general terms about the theory of political assassination , nor be-44 / / 45THE DAY O F T H E J A C K A Lcause you have a sudden shortage of trigger-fingers . You called me here because you have belatedly come to the conclusion that your organisation is so infiltrated by the French Secret Service agents that little you decide remains secret for long , and also because the faces of every one of you is imprinted on the memory of every cop in France . Therefore you need an outsider . And you are right . If the job is to be done , an outsider has to do it . The only questions that remain are who , and for how much . Now , gentlemen , I think you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " Rodin looked sideways at Montclair and raised an eyebrow . Montclairnodded . Casson followed suit . The Englishman gazed out of the window without a shred of interest . " Will you assassinate de Gaulle ? " asked Rodin at last . The voice was quiet , but the question filled the room . The Englishman 's glance came back to him , and the eyes were blank again . " Yes , but it will cost a lot of money . " " How much ? " asked Montclair . " You must understand this is a once-in-a-lifetime job . The man who does it will never work again . The chances of remaining not only uncaught but undiscovered are very small . One must take enough for this one job both to be able to live well for the rest of his days and to acquire protection against the revenge of the Gaullists  --  " " When we have France , " said Casson , " there will be no short-age  --  " " Cash , " said the Englishman . " Half in advance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Rodin . " Ilalf a million . " Rodin glanced at Montclair , who grimaced . " That 's a lot of money , half a million new francs  --  " " Dollars , " said the Englishman . " Half ' a million dollars ? " shouted Montclair , rising from his seat . " You are crazy ? " " No , " said the Englishman calmly , " but I am the best , and thereforethe most expensive . " Anatomy of a Plot " We could certainly get cheaper estimates , " sneered Casson . " Yes , " said the blond man without emotion , " you would get men cheaper , and you would find they took your fifty-per-cent deposit and vanished or made excuses later as to why it could not be done . When you employ the best you pay . Half a million dollars is the price . Considering you expect to get France itself , you value your country very cheap . " Rodin , who had remained quiet through this exchange , took the point . " Touche . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a million dollars cash . " " I am aware of that , " replied the Englishman . " If you want the job done you will have to make that sum from somewhere . I do not need the job , you understand . After my last assignment I have enough to live well for some years . But the idea of having enough to retire is appealing . Therefore I am prepared to take some exceptionally high risks for that price . Your friends here want a prize even greater  --  France herself . Yet the idea of risks appals them . I am sorry . If you can not acquire the sum involved , then you must go back to arranging your own plots and seeing them destroyed by the authorities one by one . " He half-rose from his chair , stubbing out his cigarette in the process . Rodin rose with him . " Be seated , monsieur . We shall get the money . " Both sat down . " Good , " said the Englishman , " but there are also conditions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outsider in the first place is because of constant security leaks to the French authorities . How many people in your organisation know of this idea of hiring any outsider at all , let alone me ? " " Just the three of us in this room . I worked out the idea the day after Bastien-Thiry was executed . Since then I have undertaken all the enquiries personally . There is no one else in the know . " " Then it must remain that way , " said the Englishman . " All records of all meetings , files , and dossiers must be destroyed . There must beTHE DAY OF THE JACKAL Anatomy of a Plotnothing available outside your three heads . In view of what happened in February to Argoud , I shall feel myself free to call off if any of you three are captured . Therefore you should remain somewhere safe and under heavy guard until the job is done . Agreed ? " " D'accord . What else ? " " The planning will be mine , as with the operation . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . In short , I shall disappear . You will hear nothing from me again . You have my telephone number in London and my address , but I shall be leaving both as soon as I am ready to move . " In any event you will only contact me at that place in an emergency . For the rest there will be no contact at all . I shall leave you the name of my bank in Switzerland . When they tell me the first two hundred and fifty thousand dollars has been deposited , or when I am fully ready , whichever is the later , I shall move . I will not be hurried beyond my own judgement , nor will I be subject to interference . Agreed ? " " D'accord . But our undercover men in France are in a position to offer you considerable assistance in the way of information . Some of them are highly placed . " The Englishman considered this for a moment . " All right , when you are ready send me by mail a single telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that number direct from anywhere in France . I will not give anyone my own whereabouts , but simply ring that number for latest information about the security situation surrounding the President . But the man on the end of that telephone should not know what I am doing in France . Simply tell him that I am on a mission for you and need his assistance . The less he knows , the better . Let him be simply a clearing house for information . Even his sources should be confined uniquely to those in a position to give valuable inside information , not rubbish that I can read in the newspapers . Agreed ? " " Very well . You wish to operate entirely alone , without friends or refuge . lie it on your own head . How about false papers ? We have two excellent forgers at our disposal . " " I will acquire my own , thank you . " Casson broke in . " I have a complete organisation inside France similar to the Resistance during the German occupation . I can put this entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No thank you . I prefer to bank on my own complete anonymity . It is the best weapon I have . " " But supposing something should go wrong , you might have to go on the run  --  " " Nothing will go wrong , unless it comes from your side . I will operate without contacting or being known to your organisation , M. Casson , for exactly the same reason I am here in the first place : because the organisation is crawling with agents and stool-pigeons . " Casson looked fit to explode . Montclair stared glumly at the windowtrying to envisage raising half a million dollars in a hurry . Rodin stared thoughtfully back at the Englishman across the table . " Calm , Andre . Monsieur wishes to work alone . So be it . That is his way . We do not pay half a million dollars for a man who needs the same amount of molly-coddling our own shooters need . " " What I would like to know , " muttered Montclair , " is how we can raise so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rob a few banks , " suggested the Englishmanlightly . " In any case , that is our problem , " said Rodin . " Before our visitor returns to London , are there any further points ? " " What is to prevent you from taking the first quarter of a million and disappearing ? " asked Casson . " I told you , messieurs , I wanted to retire . I do not wish to have half an army of ex-paras gunning for me . I would have to spend more protecting myself than the money I have made . It would soon be gone . " " And what , " persisted Casson , " is to prevent us waiting until the job is done and then refusing to pay you the balance of the half million ? " " The same reason , " replied the Englishman smoothly . " In that event I should go to work on my own account . And the target would48 / / 49THE DAY O F THE J A C K A Lbe you three gentlemen . However , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rodin interrupted . " Well , if that is all , I do n't think we need detain our guest any longer . Oh . . . there is one last point . Your name . If you wish to remain anonymous you should have a code name . Do you have any ideas ? " The Englishman thought for a moment . " Since we have been speakingof hunting , what about the Jackal ? Will that do ? " Rodin nodded . " Yes , that will do fine . In fact I think I like it . " He escorted the Englishman to the door and opened it . Viktor left his alcove and approached . For the first time Rodin smiled and held out his hand to the assassin . " We will be in touch in the agreed manner as soon as we can . In the meantime could you begin planning in general terms so as not to waste too much time ? Good . Then bonsoir , Monsieur Chacal . " The Pole watched the visitor depart as quietly as he had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and caught the first plane back to London in the morning . Inside the Pei.sion Kleist Rodin faced a barrage of belated questions and complaints from Casson and Montclair , who had both been shaken by the three hours between nine and midnight . " Half a million dollars , " Montclair kept repeating . " How on earth do we raise half a million dollars ? " " We may have to take up Chacal 's suggestion and rob a few banks , " answered Rodin . " I do n't like that man , " said Casson . " He works alone , without allies . Such men are dangerous . One can not control them . " Rodin closed the discussion . " Look , you two , we devised a plan , we agreed on a proposal , and we sought a man prepared to and capable of killing the President of France for money . I know a bit about men like that . If anyone can do it , he can . Now we have made our play . Let us get on with our side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /Q threeDuring the second half of June and the whole of July in 1963 France was rocked by an outbreak of violent crime against banks , jewellers ' shops , and post offices that was unprecedented at the time and has never been repeated since . The details of this crime wave are now a matter of record . From one end of the country to the other , banks were held up with pistols , sawn-off shotguns , and submachine-guns on an almost daily basis . Smash and grab raids at jewellers ' shops became so common throughout that period that local police forces had hardly finished taking depositions from the shaken and often bleeding jewellers and their assistants than they were called away to another similar case within their own district . Two bank clerks were shot in different towns as they tried to resist the robbers , and before the end of July the crisis had grown so great that the men of the Corps Republicain de Securite , the anti-riot squads known to every Frenchman simply as the CRS , were called in and for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those entering a bank to have to pass one or two of the blueuniformedCRS guards in the foyer , each toting a loaded submachine carbine . In response to pressure from the bankers and jewellers , who coin-/ 51THE DAY O F THE J A C K A L Anatomy of a Plotplained bitterly to Government about this crime wave , police checks on banks at night were increased in frequency , but to no avail , since the robbers were not professional cracksmen able to open a bank vault skilfully during the hours of darkness , but simply thugs in masks , armed and ready to shoot if provoked in the slightest way . The danger hours were in daylight , when any bank or jeweller shop throughout the country could be surprised in the middle of business by the appearance of two or three armed and masked men , and the peremptory cry " Haut les mains . " Three robbers were wounded towards the end of July in different hold-ups , and taken prisoner . Each turned out to be either a petty crook known to be using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anarchy or a deserter from one of the former colonial regimentswho soon admitted he was an OAS man . But despite the most diligent interrogations at police headquarters , none of the three could be persuaded to say why this rash of robberies had suddenly struck the country , other than that they had been contacted by their patron ( gang boss ) and given a target in the form of a bank or jewel-shop . Eventually the police came to believe that the prisoners did not know what the purpose of the robberies was ; they had each been promised a cut of the total , and being small fry had done what they were told . It did not take the French authorities long to realise that the OAS was behind the outbreak and that for some reason the OAS needed money in a hurry . But it was not until the first fortnight of August , and then in a quite different manner , that the authorities discovered why . Within the last two weeks of June the wave of crime against banks and other places where money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious to be handed over to the Commissaire Maurice Bouvier , the much-revered chief of the Brigade Criminelle of the Police Judiciaire . In his surprisingly small , work-strewn office at the headquarters of the PJ at 36 , Quai des Orfcvres along the banks of the Seine a chart was prepared showing the cash or , in the case of jewellery , approximate re-sale value of the stolen money and gems . By the latter half of July the total was wellover two million new francs , or 400,000 dollars . Even with a reasonablesum deducted for the expenses of mounting the various robberies , and more for paying the hoodlums and deserters who carried them out , that still left , in the Commissaire 's estimation , a sizeable sum of money that could not be accounted for . In the last week of June a report landed on the desk of General Guibaud , the head of the SDECE , from the chief of his permanent office in Rome . It was to the effect that the three top men of the OAS , Marc Rodin , Rene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together on the top floor of a hotel just off the Via Condotti . The report added that despite the obvious cost of residingin such an exclusive quarter , the three had taken the entire top floor for themselves , and the floor below for their bodyguards . They were being guarded night and day by no less than eight extremelytough ex-members of the Foreign Legion and were not venturing out at all . At first it was thought they had met for a conference , but as the days passed SDECE came to the view that they were simply taking exceptionally heavy precautions to ensure that they were not the victims of another kidnapping as had been inflicted on Antoine Argoud . General Guibaud permitted himself a grim smile at the sight of the top men of the terrorist organisationthemselves now cowering in a hotel in Rome , and filed the report in a routine manner . Despite the bitter row still festering between the French Foreign Ministry at the Quai d'Orsay and the German Foreign Ministry in Bonn over the infringement of Germanterritorial integrity at the Eden-Wolff Hotel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his Action Service men who had carried out the coup . The sight of the OAS chiefs running scared was reward enough in itself . The General smothered a small shadow of misgiving as he surveyed the file of Marc Rodin and nevertheless asked himself why a man like Rodin should scare that easily . As a man with considerable experience in his own job and an awareness of the realities of politics and diplomacy , he knew he would be most unlikely ever to obtain permission to organise another snatch job . It was only much later52 / / 53THE DAY OF THE JACKAL Anatomy of a Plotthat the real significance of the precautions the three OAS men were taking for their own safety became clear to him . In London the Jackal spent the last fortnight of June and the first two weeks of July in carefully controlled and planned activity . From the day of his return he set himself among other things to acquire and read almost every word written about or by Charles de Gaulle . By the simple expedient of going to the local lending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaulle he compiled a comprehensive bibliography about his subject . After that he wrote off to various well-known bookshops , using a false name and a forwarding address in Praed Street , Paddington , and acquired the necessary books by post . These he scoured until the small hours each morning in his flat , building up in his mind a most detailed picture of the incumbent of the Elysee Palace from his boyhood until the time of reading . Much of the information he gleaned was of no practical use , but here and there a quirk or character trait would emerge that he noted in a small exercise book . Most instructive concerning the character of the French President was the third volumeof the General 's memoirs , The Edge of the Sword ( Le Fil de l'Epee ) , in which Charles de Gaulle was at his most illuminating about his own personal attitude to life , his country , and his destiny as he saw it . The Jackal was neither a slow nor a stupid man . He read voraciouslyand planned meticulously , and possessed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factual information on the offchancethat he might later have a use for it . But although his reading of the works of Charles de Gaulle , and the books about him by the men who knew him best , provided a full picture of the proud and disdainful President of France , it still did not solve the main question that had been baffling him since he accepted the assignment in Rodin 's bedroom in Vienna on June 15 . By the end of the first week in July he still had not worked out the answer to this question  --  when , where , and how should the " hit " take place ? As a last resort he went down to the reading room of the British Museum54 /and , after signing his application for permission to do research with his habitual false name , started to work his way through the back copies of France 's leading daily newspaper , Le Figaro . Just when the answer came to him is not exactly known , but it is fair to presume it was within three days from July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ germ of an idea triggered by a columnist writing in 1962 , cross-checking back through the files covering every year of de Gaulle 's presidency since 1945 , the assassin managed to answer his own question . He decided within that time precisely on what day , come illness or bad weather , totally regardless of any considerations of personal danger , Charles de Gaulle would stand up publicly and show himself . From that point on , the Jackal 's preparationsmoved out of the research stage and into that of practical planning . It took long hours of thought , lying on his back in his flat staring up at the cream painted ceiling and chain-smoking his habitual kingsizefilter cigarettes , before the last detail had clicked into place . At least a dozen ideas were considered and rejected before he finally hit on the plan he decided to adopt , the " how " that had to be added to the " when " and " where " that he had already decided . The Jackal was perfectly aware that in 1963 General de Gaulle was not only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and skilfully guarded figure in the western world . To assassinate him , as was later proved , was considerably more difficult than to kill PresidentJohn F. Kennedy of the United States . Although the English killer did not know it , French security experts who had through American courtesy been given an opportunity to study the precautionstaken to guard the life of President Kennedy had returned somewhat disdainful of those precautions as exercised by the AmericanSecret Service . The French experts ' rejection of the American methods was later justified when in November 1963 John Kennedy was killed in Dallas by a half-crazed amateur while Charles de Gaulle lived on , to retire in peace and eventually to die in his own house . What the Jackal did know was that the security men he was up against were at least among the best in the world , that the whole/ 55THE DAY OF THE JACKAL Anatomy of a Plotsecurity apparatus around de Gaulle was in a state of permanent forewarning of the likelihood of some attempt being made on their charge 's life , and that the organisation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the credit side he could reasonably bank on his own anonymity and on the choleric refusal of his victim to cooperate with his own security forces . On the chosen day , the pride , the stubbornness , and the absolute contempt for personal danger of the French President would force him to come out into the open for a few seconds no matter what the risks involved . The SAS airliner from Kastrup , Copenhagen , made one last swing into line in front of the terminal building at London , trundled forward a few feet , and halted . The engines whined on for a few seconds , then they also died away . Within a few minutes the steps were wheeled up , and the passengers started to file out and down , nodding a last goodbye to the smiling stewardess at the top . On the observation terrace the blond man slipped his dark glasses upwards onto his forehead and applied his eyes to a pair of binoculars . The file of passengers coming down the steps was the sixth that morning to be subjected to this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warm sunshine with people waiting for arriving passengers and trying to spot them as soon as they emerged from their aircraft , the watcher 's behaviour aroused no interest . As the eighth passenger emerged into the light and straightened up , the man on the terrace tensed slightly and followed the new arrival down the steps . The passenger from Denmark was a priest or pastor , in a clerical grey suit with a dog-collar . He appeared to be in his late forties from the iron-grey hair cut at medium length that was brushed back from the forehead , but the face was more youthful . He was a tall man with wide shoulders , and he looked physically fit . He had approximatelythe same build as the man who watched him from the terrace above . As the passengers filed into the arrivals lounge for passport and customs clearance , the Jackal dropped the binoculars into the leather56 /brief-case by his side , closed it , and walked quietly back through the glass doors and down into the main hall . Fifteen minutes later the Danish pastor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitcase . There appeared to be nobody to meet him , and his first call was made to the Barclays Bank counter to change money . From what he told the Danish police when they interrogated him six weeks later , he did not notice the blond young Englishman standing beside him at the counter , apparently waiting his turn in the queue but quietly examining the features of the Dane from behind dark glasses . At least he had no memory of such a man . But when he came out of the main hall to board the BEA coach to the Cromwell Road terminal , the Englishman was a few paces behind him holding his brief-case , and they must have travelled into London on the same coach . At the terminal the Dane had to wait a few minutes while his suitcase was unloaded from the luggage trailer behind the coach , then wend his way past the checking-in counters to the exit signs marked with an arrow and the international word " Taxis . " While he did so , the Jackal strode round the back of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had left his car in the staff car-park . He hefted the brief-case into the passenger seat of the open sports model , climbed in , and started up , bringing the car to a halt close to the left-hand wall of the terminal from where he could glance to the right down the long line of waiting taxis under the pillared arcade . The Dane climbed into the third taxi , which cruised off into the Cromwell road , heading towards Knightsbridge . The sports car followed . The taxi dropped the oblivious priest at a small but comfortable hotel in Half Moon Street , while the sports car shot past the entrance and within a few minutes had found a spare parking metre on the far side of Curzon Street . The Jackal locked the brief-case in the trunk , bought a midday edition of the Evening Standard at the newsagent in Shepherd Market , and was back in the foyer of the hotel within five minutes . He had to wait another twenty-five before the Dane came downstairs and handed back his room key to the receptionist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a few seconds from the hook , and/ 57THE DAY OF THE JACKAL Anatomy of a Plotthe man in one of the foyer arm chairs apparently waiting for a friend , who lowered his newspaper as the Dane passed into the restaurant , noted that the number of the key was 47 . A few minutes later , as the receptionist bobbed back into the rear office to check a theatre bookingfor one of the guests , the man in the dark glasses slipped quietly and unnoticed up the stairs . A two-inch-wide strip of flexible mica was not enough to open the door of Room 47 , which was rather stiff , but the mica strip stiffened by a whippy little artist 's palette knife did the trick , and the spring lock slipped back with a click . As he had only gone downstairs for lunch , the pastor had left his passport on the bedside table . The Jackal was back in the corridor within thirty seconds , leaving the folder of traveller 's cheques untouched in the hopes that without any evidence of a theft the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply lost his passport somewhere else . And so it proved . Long before the Dane had finished his coffee , the Englishman had departed unseen , and it was not until much later in the afternoon , after a thorough and mystified search of his room , that the pastor mentioned the disappearance of his passport to the manager . The manager also searched the room , and after pointing out that everything else includingthe wallet of traveller 's cheques was intact , brought all his advocacyto bear to persuade his bewildered guest that there was no need to bring the police to his hotel since he had evidently lost his passport somewhere in transit . The Dane , being a kindly man and not too sure of his ground in a foreign country , agreed despite himself that this was what must have happened . So he reported the loss to the Danish Consulate-General the next day , was issued with travel documents with which to return to Copenhagen at the end of his fortnight 's stay in London , and thought no more about it . The clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a passport in the name of Pastor Per Jensen of Sankt Kjeldskirke in Copenhagen , and thought no more about it either . The date was July 14 . Two days later a similar loss was experienced by an American student from Syracuse , New York . He had arrived at the Oceanic Building of London Airport from New York , and he produced hispassport in order to change the first of his traveller 's cheques at the American Express counter . After changing the cheque he placed the money in an inside pocket of his jacket , and the passport inside a zipped pouch which he stuffed back into a small leather hand-grip . A few minutes later , trying to attract the attention of a porter , he put the grip down for a moment and three seconds later it was gone . At first he remonstrated with the porter , who led him to the Pan Americanenquiries desk , which directed him to the attention of the nearest terminal security police officer . The latter took him to an office where he explained his dilemma . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been taken by someone else accidentally in mistake for his own , a report was filed listing the matter as a deliberate theft . Apologies were made and regrets were expressed to the tall and athletic young American about the activities of pickpockets and bagsnatchersin public places , and he was told of the many precautions the airport authorities took to try to curb their thefts from incoming foreigners . He had the grace to admit that a friend of his was once robbed in a similar manner in Grand Central Station . The report was eventually circulated in a routine manner to all the divisions of the London Metropolitan Police , together with a description of the missing grip , its contents , and the papers and passport in the pouch . This was duly filed , but as weeks passed and no trace was found of either the grip or its contents , no more was thought of the incident . Meanwhile Marty Schulberg went to his consulate in Grosvenor Square , reported the theft of his passport , and was issued with travel documents enabling him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacation touring the highlands of Scotland with his exchange-studentgirl friend . At the consulate the loss was registered , reported to State Department in Washington , and duly forgotten by both establishments . It will never be known just how many incoming passengers at London Airport 's two overseas arrivals passenger buildings were scanned through binoculars from the observation terraces as they58 / / 591111 DAY O1 THE JACKAL Anatomy of a Plotemerged from their aircraft and headed down the steps . Despite the - litfcrence in their ages , the two who lost their passports had some things in common . Both were around six feet tall , had broad shoulders and slim figures , blue eyes , and a fairly close facial resemblance to the unobtrusive Englishman who had followed and robbed them . Otherwise , Pastor Jensen was aged forty-eight , with grey hair and goldrimmedglasses for reading ; Marty Schulberg was twenty-five , with chestnut brown hair and heavy-rimmed executive glasses which he wore all the time . These were the faces the Jackal studied at length on the writing bureau in his flat off South Audley Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visits to theatrical costumiers , opticians , a man 's clothing store in the West End specializing in garments of American type and mainly made in New York to acquire a set of blue-tinted clear-vision contact lenses ; two pairs of spectacles , one with gold rims and the other with heavy black frames , and both with clear lenses ; a complete outfit consisting of a pair of black leather loafers , T-shirt and underpants , off-white slacks and a sky-blue nylon windbreaker with a zip-up front and collars and cuffs in red and white wool , all made in New York ; and a clergyman 's white shirt , starched dog-collar , and black bib . From each of the last three the maker 's label was carefully removed . His last visit of the day was to a men 's wig and toupee emporium in Chelsea run by two homosexuals . Here he acquired a preparation for tinting the hair a medium grey and another for tinting it chestnut brown , along with precise and coyly delivered instructions on how to apply the tint to achieve the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also bought several small hairbrushes for applyingthe liquids . Otherwise , apart from the complete set of American clothes , he did not make more than one purchase at any one shop . The following day , July 18 , there was a small paragraph at the bottom of an inside page of Le Figaro . It announced that in Paris the Deputy Chief of the Brigade Criminelle of the Police Judiciaire , CommissaireHippolyte Dupuy , had suffered a severe stroke in his office at the Quai des Orfevres and had died on his way to hospital . Asuccessor had been named . He was Commissaire Claude Lebel , Chief of the Homicide Division , and in view of the pressure of work on all the departments of the Brigade during the summer months , he would take up his new duties forthwith . The Jackal , who read every French newspaper available in London each day , read the paragraph after his eye had been caught by the word " Criminelle " in the headline , but thought nothing of it . Before starting his daily watch at London Airport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forthcoming assassinationunder a false identity . It is one of the easiest things in the world to acquire a false British passport . The Jackal followed the procedure used by most mercenaries , smugglers , and others who wish to adopt an alias for passing national boundaries . First he took a car trip through the Home Counties of the Thames Valley looking for small villages . Almost every English village has an attractivelittle church , and a graveyard nestling in its shadow . In the third cemetery he visited the Jackal found a gravestone to suit his purpose , that of Alexander Duggan who died at the age of two and a half years in 1931 . Had he lived , the Duggan child would have been a few months older than the Jackal in July 1963 . The elderly vicar was courteous and helpful when the visitor presented himself at the vicarage to announce that he was an amateur genealogist engaged in attempting to trace the family tree of the Duggans . He had been informed that there had been a Duggan family that had settled in the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the parish records might be able to help him in his search . The vicar was kindness itself , and on their way over to the church a compliment on the beauty of the little Norman building and a contribution to the donations box for the restoration fund improved the atmosphere yet more . The records showed that both the Duggan parents had died over the past seven years , and , alas , their only son Alexander had been buried in this very churchyard over thirty years before . The Jackal idly turned over the pages in the parish register of births , marriages , and deaths for 1929 , and60 / / 61THE DAY OF THE JACKAL Anatomy of a Plotfor the month of April the name of Duggan , written in a crabbed and clerkly hand , caught his eye . Alexander James Quentin Duggan , born April 3 , 1929 , in the Parish of Saint Mark 's , Sambourne Fishley . He noted the details , thanked the vicar profusely , and left . Back in London he presented himself at the Central Registry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young assistant accepted without query his visiting card showing him to be a partner in a firm of solicitors of Market Drayton , Shropshire , and his explanation that he was engaged in trying to trace the whereabouts of the grandchildren of one of the firm 's clients who had recently died and left her estate to her grandchildren . One of these grandchildren was Alexander James Quentin Duggan , born at Sambourne Fishley , in the parish of Saint Mark 's on April 3 , 1929 . Most civil servants in Britain do their best to be helpful when confronted by a polite enquiry , and in this case the assistant was no exception . A search of the records showed that the child in question had been registered precisely according to the enquirer 's information , but had died on November 8 , 1931 , as the result of a road accident . For a few shillings the Jackal received a copy of both the birth and death certificates . Before returning home he stopped at a branch office of the Ministry of Labour and was issued with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shillings he bought a child 's printing set , and at a post office for a one-pound postal order . Back in his flat he filled in the application form in Duggan 's name , giving exactly the right age , date of birth , etc. , but his own personal description . He wrote in his own height , colour of hair and eyes , and for profession put down simply " businessman . " The full names of Duggan 's parents , taken from the child 's birth certificate , were also filled in . For the reference he filled in the name of Reverend James Elderly , vicar of Saint Mark 's , Sambourne Fishley , to whom he had spoken that morning , and whose full name and title of LLD had obligingly been printed on a board outside the church gate . The vicar 's signature was forged in a thin hand in thin ink with a thin nib , and from the printing set he made up a stamp reading : SAINT MARK 'S PARISH CHURCHSAMBOURNE FISHLEYwhich was placed firmly next to the vicar 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application form , and the postal order were sent off to the Passport Office in Petty France . The death certificate he destroyed . The brand new passport arrived at the accommodation address by post four days later as he was reading that morning 's edition of Le Figaro . He picked it up after lunch . Late that afternoon he locked the flat and drove to London Airport , where he boarded the flight to Copenhagen , paying in cash again to avoid using a cheque book . In the false bottom of his suitcase , in a compartment barely thicker than an ordinary magazine and almost undetectable except to the most thorough search , was two thousand pounds , which he had drawn earlier that day from his private deed box in the vaults of a firm of solicitors in Holborn . The visit to Copenhagen was brisk and businesslike . Before leaving Kastrup Airport , he booked himself on the next afternoon 's Sabena flight to Brussels . In the Danish capital it was far too late to go shopping , so he booked in at the Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Seven Nations , had a mild flirtation with two Danish blondes while strolling through the Tivoli gardens , and was in bed by one in the morning . The next day he bought a lightweight clerical grey suit at one of the best known men 's outfitters in central Copenhagen , a pair of sober black walking shoes , a pair of socks , a set of underwear and three white shirts with collars attached . In each case he bought only what had the Danish maker 's name on a small cloth tab inside . In the case of the three white shirts , which he did not need , the point of the purchase was simply to acquire the tabs for transference to the clerical shirt , dog-collar , and bib that he had bought in London while claimingto be a theological student on the verge of ordination . His last purchase was a book in Danish on the notable churches and cathedrals of France . He lunched off a large cold collation at a lakesiderestaurant in the Tivoli Gardens , and caught the 3:15 plane to Brussels. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goossens should have gone wrong in middle age was something of a mystery even to his few friends , his rather more numerous customers , and the Belgian police . During his thirty years as a trusted employee of the Fabrique Na- tionale at Liege he had established a reputation for unfailing precision in a branch of engineering where precision is absolutely indispensable . Of his honesty also there had been no doubt . He had also during those thirty years become the company 's foremost expert in the very wide range of weapons that that excellent company produces , from the tiniest lady 's automatic to the heaviest of machine guns . His war record had been remarkable . Although he had continued after the Occupation to work in the arms factory run by the Germans for the Nazi war effort , later examination of his career had established beyond doubt his undercover work for the Resistance , his participa- tion in private in a chain of safe-houses for the escape of downed Allied airmen , and at work his leadership of a sabotage ring that ensured a fair proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurately or blew up at the fiftieth shell , killing the German crews . All this , so modest and unassuming was the man , had been wormed out of him later by his defence lawyers and trium- phantly produced in court on his behalf . It had gone a long way to mitigating his sentence , and the jury had also been impressed by his own halting admission that he had never revealed his activities during the war because post-liberation honours and medals would have embarrassedhim . By the time in the early fifties that a large sum of money had been embezzled from a foreign customer in the course of a lucrative arms deal , and suspicion had fallen upon him , he was a departmental chief in the firm , and his own superiors had been loudest in informing the police that their suspicions with regard to the trusted M. Goossens were ridiculous . Even at the trial his managing director spoke for him . But the presiding judge took the view that to betray a position of trust in such a manner was all the more reprehensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On appeal it was reduced to five . With good conduct he had been released after three and a half . His wife had divorced him and taken the children with her . The old life of the suburban dweller in a neat flower-rimmed detached house in one of the prettier outskirts of Liege ( there are not many ) was over , a thing of the past . So was his career with F.N. He had taken a small flat in Brussels , later a house further out of town , as his fortunes prospered from his private business as the source of illegal arms to half the underworld in Western Europe . By the early sixties he had the nickname 1'Armurier , the Armourer . Any Belgian citizen can buy a lethal weapon  --  revolver , automatic , or rifle  --  at any sports or gun shop in the country on production of a national identity card proving Belgian nationality . Goossens never used his own , for at each sale of the weapon and subsequent ammunitionthe sale is noted in the gunsmith 's log-book , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goossens used other people 's cards , either stolen or forged . He had established close links with one of the city 's top pickpockets , a man who , when not languishing in prison as a guest of the state , could remove any wallet from any pocket at ease . These he bought outright for cash from the thief . He also had at his disposal the services of a master forger who , having come badly unstuck in the late/ 65THE DAY OF THE JACKAL Anatomy of a Plotforties over the production of a large amount of French francs in which he had inadvertently left the " u " out of " Banque de France " ( he was young then ) , had finally gone into the false passport business with much greater success . Lastly , when Goossens needed to acquire a firearm for a customer , the client who presented himself at the gunsmith 's with a neatly forged I.D . card was never himself but always an out-of-work and out-of-jail petty crook or an actor resting between conquests of the stage . Of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew his real identity . So also did some of his customers , notably the top men in the Belgian underworld , who not only left him alone to his devices but also offered him a certain amount of protection in refusing to reveal when captured where they had got their guns , simply because he was so useful to them . This did not stop the Belgian police being aware of a portion of his activities , but it did prevent them ever being able to catch him with the goods in his possession or being able to get testimony that would stand up in court and convict him . They were aware of and highly suspicious of the small but superbly equipped forge and workshop in his converted garage , but repeated visits had revealed nothing more than the paraphernalia for the manufacture of wrought-metal medallionsand souvenirs of the statues of Brussels . On their last visit he had solemnly presented the Chief Inspector with a figurine of the Manneken-Pisas a token of his esteem for the forces of law and order . He felt no qualms as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the arrival of an Englishman who had been guaranteed to him over the phone by one of his best customers , a former mercenary in the services of Katanga from 196o to 1962 who had since masterminded a protection business among the whorehouses of the Belgian capital . The visitor turned up at noon , as promised , and M. Goossens showed him into his little office off the hall . " Would you please remove your glasses ? " he asked when his visitor was seated and , as the tall Englishman hesitated , added , " You see I think it is better that we trust each other insofar as we can while our business association lasts . A drink , perhaps ? " The man whose passport would have announced him as Alexander Duggan removed his dark glasses and stared quizzically at the little gunsmith as two beers were poured . M. Goossens seated himself behind his desk , sipped his beer , and asked quietly , " In what way may I be of service to you , monsieur ? " " I believe Louis rang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " M. Goossens nodded . " Otherwise you would not be here . " " Did he tell you what is my business ? " " No . Simply that he knew you in Katanga , that he could vouch for your discretion , that you needed a firearm , and that you would be prepared to pay in cash , sterling . " The Englishman nodded slowly . " Well , since I know what your business is , there is little reason why you should not know mine . Besides which , the weapon I need will have to be a specialist gun with certain unusual attachments . I  --  er  --  specialise in the removal of men who have powerful and wealthy enemies . Evidently , such men are usually powerful and wealthy themselves . It is not always easy . They can afford specialist protection . Such a job needs planning and the right weapon . I have such a job on hand at the moment . I shall need a rifle . " M. Goossens again sipped his beer , nodded benignly at his guest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I sense a challenge . What kind of rifle had you in mind ? " " It is not so much the type of rifle that is important . It is more of a question of the limitations that are imposed by the job , and of finding a rifle which will perform satisfactorily under those limitations . " M. Goossens eyes gleamed with pleasure . " A one-off , " he purred delightedly . " A gun that will be tailor-made for one man and one job under one set of circumstances , never to be repeated . You have come to the right man . I sense a challenge , my dear monsieur . I am glad that you came . " The Englishman permitted himself a smile at the Belgian 's professorialenthusiasm . " So am I , monsieur . " " Now tell me , what are these limitations ? " 66 / / 67THE DAY OF THE JACKAL Anatomy of a Plot " The main limitation is of size , not in length but in the physical bulk of the working parts . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He held up his right hand , the tip of the middle finger touching the end of the thumb in the form of a letter o less than two and a half inches in diameter . " That seems to mean it can not be a repeater , since a gas chamber would be larger than that , nor can it have a bulky spring mechanism for the same reason , " said the Englishman . " It seems to me it must be a bolt-action rifle . " M. Goossens was nodding at the ceiling , his mind taking in the details of what his visitor was saying , making a mental picture of a rifle of great slimness in the working parts . " Go on , go on , " he murmured . " On the other hand it can not have a bolt with a handle that sticks out sideways like the Mauser seven-ninety-two or the Lee Enfield three-o-three . The bolt must slide straight back towards the shoulder , gripped between forefinger and thumb for the fitting of the bullet into the breech . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself must be detachable so that it can be fitted just before firing . " " Why ? " asked the Belgian . " Because the whole mechanism must pass into a tubular compartmentfor storage and carrying , and the compartment must not attract attention . For that it must not be larger in diameter than I have just shown , for reasons I shall explain . It is possible to have a detachable t rigger ? " " Certainly , almost all is possible . Of course , one could design a single-shot rifle that breaks open at the back for loading like a shotgun . That would dispense with the bolt completely , but it would involve a hinge , which might be no saving . Also it would be necessary to design and manufacture such a rifle from scratch , milling a piece of metal to make the entire breech and chamber . Not an easy task in a small workshop , but possible . " " How long would that take ? " asked the Englishman . The Belgian shrugged and spread his hands . " Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have that amount of time . " " In that case it will be necessary to take an existing rifle purchasable in a shop and make modifications . Please go on . " " Right . The gun must also be light in weight . It need not be of heavy calibre , the bullet will do the work . It must have a short barrel , probably not longer than twelve inches  --  " " Over what range will you have to fire ? " " This is still not certain , but probably not more than a hundred and thirty metres . " " Will you go for a head or chest shot ? " " It will probably have to be head . I may get a shot at the chest , but the head is surer . " " Surer to kill , yes , if you get agood hit , " said the Belgian . " But the chest is surer to get a good hit . At least , when one is using a light weapon with a short barrel over a hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he added , " from your uncertainty on this point of the head or the chest that there may be someone passing in the way ? " " Yes , there may be . " " Will you get the chance of a second shot , bearing in mind that it will take several seconds to extract the spent cartridge and insert a fresh one , close the breech , and take aim again ? " " Almost certainly not . I just might get a second if I use a silencer and the first shot is a complete miss which is not noticed by anyone nearby . But even if I get a first hit through the temple , I need the silencer to effect my own escape . There must be several minutes of clear time before anyone nearby realises even roughly where the bullet has come from . " The Belgian continued nodding , by now staring down at his deskpad . " In that case , you had better have explosive bullets . I shall prepare a handful along with the gun . You know what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercury ? " " Oh mercury , I think . So much neater and cleaner . Are there any more points concerning this gun ? " 68 / / 69THE DAY O F THE J A C K A L Anatomy of a Plot " I 'm afraid so . In the interests of slimness , all the woodwork of the handgrip beneath the barrel should be removed . The entire stock must be removed . For firing it must have a frame-stock like a Sten gun , each of the three sections of which , upper and lower members and shoulder-rest , must unscrew into three separate rods . Lastly , there must be a completely effective silencer and a telescopic sight . Both of these too must be removable for storage and carrying . " The Belgian thought for a long time , sipping his beer until it was drained . The Englishman became impatient . " Well , can you do it ? " M. Goossens seemed to emerge from his reverie . He smiled apologetically . " Do forgive me . It is a very complex order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never failed yet to produce the required article . Really , what you have described is a hunting expedition in which the equipment must be carried past certain checks in such a manner as to arouse no suspicion . A hunting expedition supposes a hunting rifle , and that is what you shall have . Not as small as a twenty-two calibre , for that is for rabbits and hares . Nor as big as a Remington three hundred , which would never conform to the limitations of size you have demanded . " I think I have such a gun in mind , and easily available here in Brussels at some sports shops . An expensive gun , a high-precision instrument . Very accurate , beautifully tooled , and yet light and slim . Used a lot for chamois and other small deer , but with explosive bullets just the thing for bigger game . Tell me , will the  --  er  --  gentleman be moving slowly , fast , or not at all ? " " Stationary . " " No problems then . The fittings of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are mere mechanics . The tapping of the end of the barrel for the silencer and the shortening of the barrel by eight inches I can do myself . One loses accuracy as one loses eight inches of barrel . Pity , pity . Are you a marksman ? " The Englishman nodded. ' " l'hen there will be no problem with a stationary human being ata hundred and thirty metres with a telescopic sight . As for the silencer , I shall make it myself . They are not complex , but difficult to obtain as a manufactured article , particularly long ones for rifles which are not usual in hunting . Now , monsieur , you mentioned earliersome tubular compartments for carrying the gun in its brokendownform . What had you in mind ? " The Englishman rose and crossed to the desk , towering over the little Belgian . He slipped his hand inside his jacket , and for a second there was a flicker of fear in the smaller man 's eyes . For the first time he noticed that whatever expression was on the killer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouded by streaks of grey like wisps of smoke covering all expression that might have touched them . But the Englishman produced only a silver propelling pencil . He spun round M. Goossens 's note pad and sketched rapidly for a few seconds . " Do you recognize that ? " he asked , turning the pad back to the gunsmith . " Of course , " replied the Belgian after giving the precisely drawn sketch a glance . " Right . Well now , the whole thing is composed of a series of hollow aluminum tubes which screw together . This one "  --  tapping with the point of the pencil at a place on the diagram  --  " contains one of the struts of the rifle stock . This here contains the other strut . Both are concealed within the tubes that make up this section . The shoulderrestof the rifle is this  --  here  --  in its entirety . This is therefore the only part which doubles up with two purposes without changing in any way . " Here "  --  tapping at another point on the diagram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the thickest point is the largest diametertube which contains the breech of the rifle with the bolt inside it . This tapers to the barrel without a break . Obviously , with a telescopic sight being used there need be no foresight , so the whole thing slides out of this compartment when the assemblage is unscrewed . The last two sections  --  here and here  --  contain the telescopic sight itself and the silencer . Finally the bullets . They should be inserted into this littleTHE DAY O F THE J A C K A L Anatomy of a Plotstump at the bottom . When the whole thing is assembled it must pass for precisely what it looks . When unscrewed into its seven component parts , the bullets , silencer , telescope , rifle , and the three struts that make up the triangular frame stock can be extracted for reassembly as a fully operational rifle . OK ? " For a few seconds longer the little Belgian looked at the diagram . Slowly he rose , then held out his hand . " Monsieur , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius . Undetectable . And yet so simple . It shall be done . " The Englishman was neither gratified nor displeased . " Good , " he said , " Now , the question of time . I shall need the gun in about fourteen days , can that be arranged ? " " Yes . I can acquire the gun within three . A week 's work should see the modifications achieved . Buying the telescopic sight presents no problems . You may leave the choice of the sight to me , I know what will be required for the range of a hundred and thirty metres you have in mind . You had better calibrate and zero the settings yourself at your own discretion . Making the silencer , modifying the bullets and constructing the outer casing . . . yes , it can be done within the time allowed if I burn the candle at both ends . However , it would be better if you could arrive back here with a day or two in hand , just in case there are some last minute details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days ? " " Yes , any time between seven and fourteen days from now . But fourteen days is the deadline . I must be back in London by August the fourth . " " You shall have the completed weapon with all last details arranged to your satisfaction on the morning of the fourth if you can he here yourself on August first for final discussions and collection , monsieur . " " Good . Now for the question of your expenses and fee , " said the Englishman . " Have you an idea how much they will be ? " The Belgian thought for a while . " For this kind of job , with all the work it entails , for the facilities available here and my own specialised knowledge , I must ask a fee of one thousand English pounds . I concedethat is above the rate for a simple rifle . But this is not a simple rifle . It must be a work of art . I believe I am the only man in Europe capable of doing it justice , of making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am in my field the best . For the best , one pays . Then on top there would be the purchasing price of the weapon , bullets , telescope , and raw materials . . . say , the equivalent of another two hundred pounds . " " Done , " replied the Englishman without argument . He reached into his breast pocket again and extracted a bundle of five-pound notes . They were bound in lots of twenty . He counted out five wads of twenty notes each . " I would suggest , " he went on evenly , " that in order to establish my bona fides I make you a down payment as an advance and to cover costs of five hundred pounds . I shall bring the remaining seven hundredon my return in eleven days . Is that agreeable to you ?

On my return here , if there has been any attempt to contact the police or to lay a trap , you will die . Is that understood ? " M. Goossens was pained . Standing in the hallway he looked up at the Englishman , and an eel of fear wriggled in his bowels . He had faced many of the tough men of the Belgian underworld when they came to him for special or unusual weapons , or simply a run-of-themillsnub-nosed Colt Special . These were hard men . But there was something distant and implacable about the visitor from across the Channel who intended to kill an important and well-protected figure . Not another gangland boss , but a big man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expostulating , then decided better . " Monsieur , " he said quietly . " I do not want to know about you , 72 / / 73THE DAY OF THE JACKAL anything about you . The gun you will receive will bear no serial number . You see , it is of more importance to me that nothing you do should ever be traced back to me than that I should seek to know more than I do about you . Bonjour , monsieur . " The Jackal walked away into the bright sunshine and two streets away found a cruising taxi to take him back to the city centre and the Hotel Amigo . He suspected that in order to acquire guns Goossens would have to have a forger in his employ somewhere , but preferred to find and use one of his own . Again Louis , his contact from the old days in Katanga , helped him . Not that it was difficult . Brussels has a long tradition as the centre of the forged identity-card industry , and many foreigners appreciate the lack of formalities with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early sixties Brussels had also become the operations base of the mercenary soldier , for this was before the emergence in the Congo of the French and South African/British units who later came to dominate the business . With Katanga gone , over three hundred out of work " military advisers " from the old Tshombe regime were hanging around the bars of the red-light quar- ter , many of them in possession of several sets of identity papers . The Jackal found his man in a bar off the rue Neuve after Louis had arranged the appointment . He introduced himself , and the pair retired to a corner alcove . The Jackal produced his driving licence , which was in his own name , issued by the London County Council two years earlier and with some months still to run . " This , " he told the Belgian , " belonged to a man now dead . As I am banned from driving in Britain , I need a new front page in my own name . " He put the passport in the name of Duggan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the passport first , took in the newness of the passport , the fact that it had been issued three days earlier , and glanced shrewdly at the Englishman . " En effet , " he murmured , then flicked open the little red driving licence . After a few minutes he looked up . " Not difficult , monsieur . The English authorities are gentlemen . They do not seem to expect that official documents might perhaps be forged , therefore they take few precautions . This paper "  --  he flicked the small sheet gummed onto the first page of the licence , which carried the licence number and the full name of the holder  --  " could be printed by a child 's printing set . The watermark is easy . This presents no problems . Was that all you wanted ? " " No , there are two other papers . " " Ah . If you will permit my saying so , it appeared strange that you should wish to contact me for such a simple task . There must be men in your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are the other papers ? " The Jackal described them to the last detail . The Belgian 's eyes narrowed in thought . He took out a packet of Bastos , offered one to the Englishman , who declined , and lit one for himself . " That is not so easy . The French identity card , not too bad . There are plenty about from which one can work . You understand , one must work from an original to achieve the best results . But the other one . I do not think I have seen such a one . It is a most unusual require-ment . " He paused while the Jackal ordered a passing waiter to refill their glasses . When the waiter had gone he resumed . " And then the photograph . That will not be easy . You say there must be a difference in age , in hair colouring and length . Most of those wishing for a false document intend that their own photograph shall be on the document , but with the personal details falsified . But to devise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you now appear this complicates things . " He drank off half of his beer , still eyeing the Englishman opposite him . " To achieve this it will be necessary to seek out a man of the approximate age of the bearer of the cards , who also bears a reasonablesimilarity to yourself , at least as far as the head and face is concerned , and cut his hair to the length you require . Then a photograph of this man would be put onto the cards . From that point on it would be up to you to model your subsequent disguise on this man 's true appearance , rather than the reverse . You follow me ? " / 75THE DAY OF THE JACKAL Anatomy of a Plot " Yes , " replied the Jackal . " This will take some time . How long can you stay in Brussels ? " " Not long , " said the Jackal . " I must leave fairly soon , but I could be back on August first . From then I could stay another three days . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Belgian thought again for a while , staring at the photograph in the passport in front of him . At last he folded it closed and passed it back to the Englishman after copying onto a piece of paper from his pocket the name Alexander James Quentin Duggan . He pocketed both the piece of paper and the driving licence . " All right . It can be done . But I have to have a good portrait photograph of yourself as you are now , full-face and profile . This will take time . And money . There are extra expenses involved . . . it may be necessary to undertake an operation into France itself with a colleague adept in picking pockets in order to acquire the second of these cards you mention . Obviously , I shall ask around Brussels first , but it may be necessary to go to these lengths  --  " " How much ? " cut in the Englishman . " Twenty thousand Belgian francs . " The Jackal thought for a moment . " About a hundred and fifty pounds sterling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposit and the remainder on delivery . " The Belgian rose . " Then we had better get the portrait photos taken . I have my own studio . " They took a taxi to a small basement flat more than a mile away . It turned out to be a seedy and run-down photographer 's studio , with a sign outside indicating that the premises were run as a commercial establishment specialising in passport photographs developed while the customer waited . Inevitably stuck in the window were what a passer-by must have presumed to be the high-points of the studio owner 's past work  --  two portraits of simpering girls , hideously retouched , a marriage photo of a couple sufficiently unprepossessing to deal a nasty blow to the whole concept of wedlock , and two babies . The Belgian led the way down the steps to the front door , unlocked it , and ushered his guest inside . The session took two hours , in which the Belgian showed a skill with the camera that could never have been possessed by the author of the portraits in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he unlocked with his own key , revealed a selection of expensive cameras and flash equipment , besides a host of facial props including hair tints and dyes , toupees , wigs , spectacles in great variety , and a case of theatrical cosmetics . It was halfway through the session that the Belgian hit on the idea that obviated the necessity to seek out a substitute to pose for the real photograph . Studying the effect of thirty minutes working on the Jackal 's face with makeup , he suddenly dived into the chest and produced a wig . " What do you think of this ? " he asked . The wig was of hair coloured iron-grey and cut en brosse . " Do you think that your own hair , cut to this length and dyed this colour , could look like this ? " The Jackal took the wig and examined it . " We can give it a try and see how it looks in the photo , " he suggested . And it worked . The Belgian came out of the developing room half an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheaf of prints in his hand . Together they pored over the desk . Staring up was the face of an old and tired man . The skin was an ashen gray and there were dark rings of fatigue or pain beneath the eyes . The man wore neither beard nor moustache , but the grey hair on his head gave the impression he must have been in his fifties at least , and not a robust fifty at that . " I think it will work , " said the Belgian at last . " The problem is , " replied the Jackal , " that you had to work on me with cosmetics for half an hour to achieve this effect . Then there was the wig . I can not emulate all that by myself . And here we were under lights , whereas I shall be in the open air when I have to produce these papers I have asked for . " " But this is precisely not the point , " reported the forger . " It is not so much that you will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the photograph will not be a dead likeness of you . This is the way the76 / / 77THE DAY OF THE JACKAL Anatomy of a Plotmind of a man examining papers works . He looks at the face first , the real face , then asks for the papers . Then he sees the photograph . He already has the image of the man standing beside him in his mind 's eye . This affects his judgement . He looks for points of similarity , not the opposite . " Secondly , this photograph is twenty-five by twenty centimetres . The photograph in the identity card will be three by four . Thirdly , a too precise likeness should be avoided . If the card was issued several years previously , it is impossible that a man should not change a bit . In the photograph here we have you in open-necked striped shirt with collar attached . Try to avoid that shirt for example , or even avoid an open-necked shirt at all . Wear a tie , or a scarf or a turtle-necked sweater . " Lastly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily simulated . The main point of course is the hair . It must be cut en brosse before this photo is presented , and dyed grey , perhaps even greyer than in the photograph , but not less so . To increase the impression of age and decrepitude , grow two or three days of beard stubble . Then shave with a cut-throat razor , but badly , nicking yourself in a couple of places . Elderly men tend to do this . As for the complexion , this is vital . To extract pity it must be grey and tired , rather waxy and ill-looking . Can you get hold of some pieces of cordite ? " The Jackal had listened to the exegesis of the forger with admiration , though nothing showed on his face . For the second time in a day he had been able to contact a professional who knew his job thoroughly . He reminded himself to thank Louis appropriately  --  after the job was done . " It might be arranged , " he said cautiously . " Two or three small pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour a feeling of nausea , uncomfortable but not disastrous . They also turn the skin a grey pallor and cause facial sweating . We used to use this trick in the Army to simulate illness and avoid fatigue and route marches . " " Thank you for the information . Now for the rest , do you think you can produce the documents in time ? " " From the technical standpoint , there is no doubt of it . The only remaining problem is to acquire an original of the second French document . For that I may have to work fast . But if you come back in the first few days of August , I think I can have them all ready for you . You  --  er  --  had mentioned a down payment to cover ex-penses  --  " The Jackal reached into his inside pocket and produced a single bundle of twenty five-pound notes , which he handed the Belgian . " How do I contact you ? " he asked . " I would suggest by the same way as tonight . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or out of town . Then I would have no way of finding you . " The Belgian thought for a minute . " Then I shall wait from six until seven each evening in the bar where we met tonight on each of the first three days of August . If you do not come , I shall presume the deal is off . " The Englishman had removed the wig and was wiping his face with a towel soaked in removing spirit . In silence he slipped on his tie and jacket . When he was finished he turned to the Belgian . " There are certain things I wish to make clear , " he said quietly . The friendliness was gone from the voice and the eyes stared at the Belgian as bleak as a Channel fog . " When you have finished the job , you will he present at the bar as promised . You will return to me the new licence and the page removed from the one you now have . Also the negatives and all prints of the photographs we have just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the original owner of that driving licence . The name of the two French documents you are going to produce you may select yourself , providing it is a simple and common French name . After handing them over to me you will forget that name also . You will never speak to anyone of this commission again . In the event that you infringe any of these conditions , you willi die . Is that understood ? " The Belgian stared back for a few moments . Over the past three hours he had come to think of the Englishman as a run-of-the-mill customer who simply wished to drive a car in Britain and masqueradeTHE DAY OF THE JACKAL Anatomy of a Plotfor his own purposes as a middle-aged man in France . A smuggler , perhaps , running dope or diamonds from a lonely Breton fishing port into England . " It is understood , monsieur . " A few seconds later the Englishman was gone into the night . He walked for five blocks before taking a taxi back to the Amigo , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottle of Moselle in his room , bathed thoroughly to get rid of the last traces of make-up , then slept . The following morning he checked out of the hotel and took the Brabant Express to Paris . It was July 22 . The head of the Action Service of the SDECE sat at his desk on that same morning and surveyed the two pieces of paper before him . Each was a copy of a routine report filed by agents of other departments . At the head of each piece of blue flimsy was a list of departmentchiefs entitled to receive a copy of the report . Opposite his own designation was a small tick . Both reports had come in that morning and in the normal course of events Colonel Rolland would have glanced at each , taken in what they had to say , stored the knowledge somewhere in his fearsome memory , and had them filed under separateheadings . But there was one word that cropped up in each of the reports , a word that intrigued him . The first report that arrived was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing a synopsis of a despatch from their permanent office in Rome . The despatch was a straight-forward report to the effect that Rodin , Montclair , and Casson were still holed up in their top floor suite and were still being guarded by their eight guards . They had not moved out of the building since they established themselves there on June 18 . Extra staff had been drafted from R 3 Paris to Rome to assist in keeping the hotel under round-the-clock surveillance . Instructions from Paris remained unchanged : not to make any approach but simply to keep watch . The men in the hotel had established a routine for keeping in touch with the outside world three weeks previously ( " see R 3 Rome report of June 30 " ) , and this was being maintained . The courier remained Viktor Kowalski . End of message . Colonel Rolland flicked open the buff file lying on the right of his desk next to the sawn-off 105 mm. shell case that served for a copious ashtray and was even by then half-full of Disque Bleue stubs . His eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till he found the paragraph he wanted . Each day , it said , one of the guards left the hotel and walked to the head post office of Rome . Here a Poste Restante pigeonhole was reserved in the name of one Poitiers . The OAS had not taken a postal box with a key , apparently for fear it might be burgled . All mail for the top men of the OAS was addressed to Poitiers and was kept by the clerk on duty at the Poste Restante counter . An attempt to bribe the original such clerk to hand over the mail to an agent of R 3 had failed . The man had reported the approach to his superiors and had been replaced by a senior clerk . It was possible that mail for Poitiers was now being screened by the Italian security police , but R 3 had instructions not to approach the Italians to ask for cooperation . The attempt to bribe the clerk had failed , but it was felt the initiative had to be taken . Each day the mail arriving overnight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been identified as one Viktor Kowalski , formerly a corporal of the Foreign Legion and a member of Rodin 's original company in Indochina . Kowalski seemingly had adequate false papers identifying him to the post office as Poitiers , or a letter of authority acceptable to the post office . If Kowalski had letters to post , he waited by the post box inside the main hall of the building until five minutes before collection time , dropped the mail through the slit , then waited until the entire box-full was collected and taken back into the heart of the building for sorting . Attempts to interfere with the process of either collection or despatch of the OAS chief 's mail would entail a degree of violence , which had already been precluded by Paris . Occasionally Kowalski made a telephone call , long-distance , from the Overseas Calls telephone counter , but here again attempts either to learn the number asked for or to overhear the conversation had failed . End of message. 80 / / 81THE DAY OF THE JACKALColonel Rolland let the cover of the file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the two reports that had come in that morning . It was a police report from the Police Judiciaire of Metz stating that a man had been questioned during a routine raid on a bar and had half-killed two policemen in the ensuing fight . Later at the police station he had been identified by his fingerprints as a deserter from the Foreign Legion by the name of Sandor Kovacs , Hungarian by birth and a refugee from Budapest in 1956 . Kovacs , a note from PJ Paris added at the end of the information from Metz , was a notorious OAS thug long wanted for his connection with a series of terror murders of loyalist notables in the Bone and Constantine areas of Algeria during 1961 . At that time he had operated as partner of another OAS gunman still at large , former Foreign Legion corporal Viktor Kowalski . End of message . Rolland pondered the connection between the two men yet again , as he had done for the previous hour . At last he pressed a buzzer in front of him and replied to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Get me the personal file on Viktor Kowalski . At once . " He had the file up from archives in ten minutes , and spent another hour reading it . Several times he ran his eye over one particular paragraph . As other Parisians in less demanding professions hurried past on the pavement below to their lunches , Colonel Rolland conveneda small meeting consisting of himself , his personal secretary , a specialist in handwriting from the documentation department three floors down , and two strong-arm men from his private Praetorian Guard . " Gentlemen , " he told them , " with the unwilling but inevitable assistance of one not here present , we are going to compose , write , and despatch a letter . " The Jackal 's train arrived at the Gare du Nord just before lunch , and he took a taxi to a small but extremely comfortable hotel in the rue de Suresne , leading off from the Place de la Madeleine . While it was not a hotel in the same class as the D'Angleterre of Copenhagen or the Amigo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more modest and less known place to stay while in Paris . For one thing his stay would be longer , and for another there was far more likelihood of running into somebody in Paris in late July who might have known him fleetingly in London under his real name than in either Copenhagenor Brussels . Out on the street he was confident that the wraparounddark glasses he habitually wore , and which in the bright sunshine of the boulevards were completely natural , would protect his identity . The possible danger lay in being seen in a hotel corridor or foyer . The last thing he wished at this stage was to be halted by a cheery " Well , fancy seeing you here , " and then the mention of his name within the hearing of a desk clerk who knew him as Mr. Duggan . Not that his stay in Paris had anything about it to excite attention . He lived quietly , taking his breakfast of croissants and coffee in his room . From the delicatessen across the road from his hotel he bought a jar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 83THE DAY OF THE JACKAL Anatomy of a Ploton the breakfast tray , and asked the hotel staff to include the jar of marmalade on his tray each morning in place of the jam . He was quietly courteous to the staff , spoke only a few words of French with the Englishman 's habitually atrocious pronunciation of the French language , and smiled politely when addressed . He replied to the management 's solicitous enquiries by assuring them that he was extremely comfortable and thank you . " M. Duggan , " the hotel proprietress told her desk clerk one day , " est extremement gentil . Un vrai gentleman . " There was no dissent . His days were spent out of the hotel in the pursuits of the tourists . On his first day he bought a street map of Paris , and from a small notebook marked off on the map the places of interest he most wanted to see . These he visited and studied with remarkable devotion , even bearing in mind the architectural beauty of some of them or the historical association of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Triomphe or sitting on the terrace of the Cafe de 1'Elysee scanning the monument and the rooftops of the great buildings that surround the Place de 1'Etoile . Anyone who had followed him in those days ( and no one did ) would have been surprised that even the architecture of the brilliant M. Haussmann should have attracted so devoted an admirer . Certainly no watcher could have divined that the quiet and elegant English tourist stirring his coffee and gazing at the buildings for so many hours was mentally working out angles of fire , distances from the upper stories to the Eternal Flame flickering beneath the Arc , and the chances of a man fleeing down a rear fire escape unnoticed into the milling crowds . After three days he left the Etoile and visited the ossuary of the martyrs of the French Resistance at Montvalerien . Here he arrived with a bouquet of flowers , and a guide , touched by the gesture of the Englishman to the guide 's one-time fellow Resistants , gave him an exhaustive tour of the shrine and a running commentary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept straying away from the entrance to the ossuary towards the high walls of the prison which cut off all direct vision into the courtyard from the roofs of the surroundingbuildings . After two hours he left with a polite " thank-you " and a generous but not extravagant pourboire . He also visited the Place des Invalides , dominated on its southern side by the Hotel des Invalides , home of Napoleon 's tomb and shrine to the glories of the French Army . The western side of the enormous square , formed by the rue Fabert , interested him most , and he sat for a morning at the corner cafe where the rue Fabert adjoins the tiny triangular Place de Santiago du Chili . From the sixth or seventh floor of the building above his head , 146 , rue de Grenelle , where that street joins the rue Fabert at an angle of ninety degrees , he estimated that a gunman would be able to dominate the front gardens of the Invalides , the entrance to the inner courtyard , most of the Place des Invalides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a last stand , but not for an assassination . For one thing , the distance from the upper windows to the gravelled path leading from the Invalides Palace to where cars would be drawn up at the base of the steps between the two tanks was over two hundred metres . For another , the view downwardsfrom the windows of number 146 would be partly obscured by the topmost branches of the dense lime trees growing in the Place de Santiago and from which the pigeons dropped their off-white tributes onto the shoulders of the uncomplaining statue of Vauban . Regretfully , he paid for his Vittel Menthe and left . A day was spent in the precincts of Notre Dame cathedral . Here amid the rabbit warren of the Ile de la Cite were back stairways , alleys , and passageways , but the distance from the entrance to the cathedral to the parked cars at the foot of the steps was only a few metres , and the rooftops of the Place du Parvis were too far away , while those of the tiny abutting Square Charlemagne were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watchers . His last visit was to the square at the southern end of the rue de Rennes . He arrived on July 28 . Once called the Place de Rennes , the square had been renamed when the Gaullists took power in the City Hall , and was now called Place du 18 Juin 1940 . The Jackal 's eyes strayed to the shining new name plate on the wall of the building and remained there . Something of what he had read the previous month84 / / 85THE DAY OF THE JACKALAnatomy of a Plotreturned to him . June 18 , 1940 , the day when the lonely but lofty exile in London had taken the microphone to tell the French that if they had lost a battle , they had not lost the war . There was something about this square , with the crouching bulk of the Gare Montparnasse on its southern side , full of memories for the Parisians of the war generation , that caused the assassin to stop . Slowly he surveyed the expanse of tarmac , crisscrossed now by a maelstrom of traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streams from the rue d'Odessa and the rue de Rennes . He looked round at the tall , narrow-fronted buildings on each side of the rue de Rennes that also overlooked the square . Slowly he wended his way round the square to the southern side and peered through the railings into the courtyard of the station . It was a-buzz with cars and taxis bringing or taking away tens of thousands of commuter passengers a day , one of the great mainline stations of Paris . By that winter it would become a silent hulk , brooding on the events , human and historical , that had taken place in its steely , smoky shadow . The station was destined for demolition in 1964 , when a new station was to be built five hundred yards along the railway line . The Jackal turned with his back to the railings and looked down the traffic artery of the rue de Rennes . He was facing the Place du 18 Juin 1940 , convinced that this was the place the President of France would come one last time , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past week were possibles ; this one , he felt sure , was the certainty . Within a short time there would be no more Gare Montparnasse , the columns that had looked down on so much would be smelted for suburban fences , and the forecourt that had seen Berlin humiliated and Paris preserved would be just another executives ' cafeteria . But before that happened , he , the man with the kepi and two gold stars , would come once again . But in the meantime the distance from the top floor of the corner house on the western side of the rue de Rennes and the centre of the forecourt was about 130 metres . The Jackal took in the landscape facing him with a practised eye . Both corner houses on the rue de Rennes where it debouched into the%quire were obvious choices . The first three houses up the rue de Rennes were possibles , presenting a narrow firing angle into the forecourt . Beyond them the angle became too narrow . Similarly , the first three houses that fronted the Boulevard de Montparnasse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beyond them the angles became too narrow again , and the distance too great . There were no other buildings that dominated the forecourt that were not too far away , other than the station building itself . But this would be out of bounds , its upper office windows overlooking the forecourt crawling with security men . The Jackal decided to study the three corner houses on the western side of the rue de Rennes first , and sauntered over to a cafe on the corner at the eastern side , the Cafe Duchesse Anne . Here he sat on the terrace a few feet from the roaring traffic , ordered a coffee , and stared at the houses across the street . He stayed for three hours . Later he lunched at the Hansi Brasserie Alsacienne on the far side , and studied the eastern facades . For the afternoon he sauntered up and down , looking at closer quartersinto the front doors of the blocks of apartments he had picked out as possibles . He moved on eventually to the houses that fronted the Boulevardde Montparnasse itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more briskly busy . The next day he was back again , sauntering past the facades , crossing the road to sit on a pavement bench under the trees and toying with a newspaper while he studied the upper floors . Five or six floors of stone facade , topped by a parapet , then the steeply sloping black-tiled roofs containing the attics , pierced by mansard windows , once the quarters of the servants , now the homes of the poorer pensionnaires . The roofs , and possibly the mansards themselves , would certainly be watched on the day . There might even be watchers on the roofs , crouching among the chimney stacks , their field glasses on the opposite windows and roofs . But the topmostfloor below the attics would be high enough , providing one could sit well back into the darkness of the room not to be visible86 / I / 87THE DAY OF THE JACKALfrom across the street . The open window , in the sweltering heat of a Paris summer , would be natural enough . But the further back one sat inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sideways down into the forecourt of the station . For this reason the Jackal ruled out the third house into the rue de Rennes on each side of the street . The angle would be too narrow . That left him four houses to choose from . As the time of day he expected to fire would be the midafternoon , with the sun moving towards the west , but still high enough in the sky to shine over the top of the station roof into the windows of the houses on the east side of the street , he eventually chose those two on the west side . To prove it , he waited until four o'clock on July 29 and noticed that on the west side the topmost windows were receiving only a slanting ray from the sun , while it still fiercely lit the houses on the east . The next day he noticed the concierge . It was his third day sitting either at a cafe terrace or on a pavement bench , and he had chosen a bench a few feet from the doorways of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few feet , behind him and separated by the pavement down which pedestrians scurried endlessly , the conciergesat in her doorway and knitted . Once , from a nearby cafe , a waiter strolled over for a chat . He called the concierge Madame Berthe . It was a pleasant scene . The day was warm , the sun bright , reaching several feet into the dark doorway while it was still in the southeast and south , high in the sky over the station roof across the square . She was a comfortable grandmotherly soul , and from the way she chirped " Bonjour , monsieur " to the people who occasionally entered or left her block , and from the cheerful " Bonjour , Madame Berthe " that she received each time in return , the watcher on the bench twenty feet away judged that she was well-liked . A good-natured body , and with compassion for the unfortunate of this world . For shortly after two in the afternoon a cat presented itself and within a few minutes , after diving into the dark recesses of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berthe was back with a saucer of milk for the creature she referred to as her little Minet . Anatomy of a PlotShortly before four she bundled up her knitting , put it into one of the capacious pockets of her pinafore , and shuffled on slippered feet down the road to the bakery . The Jackal rose quietly from his bench and entered the apartment block . He chose the stairs rather than the lift and ran silently upwards . The stairs ran round the lift shaft , and at each curve on the rear of the building , the stairs halted to make room for a small halflanding . On each second floor this landing gave access through a door in the rear wall of the block to a steel fire escape . At the sixth and top floor , apart from the attics , he opened the rear door and looked down . The fire escape led to an inner courtyard , around which were the rear entrances to the other blocks that made up the corner of the square behind him . On the far side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a narrow covered alleyway leading towards the north . The Jackal closed the door quietly , replaced the safety bar , and mounted the last half-flight to the sixth floor . From here , at the end of the passage , a humbler staircase led to the upper attics . There weretwo doors in the passage giving access to flats overlooking the inner courtyard and two others for flats on the front of the building . His sense of direction told him either of these front flats contained windowslooking down into the rue de Rennes , or half-sideways onto the square and beyond it the forecourt of the station . These were the windows he had been observing for so long from the street below . One of the name plates next to the bell pushes of the two front flats he now confronted bore the inscription " Mlle Beranger . " The other bore the name " M. et Mme Charrier . " He listened for a moment but there was no sound from either of the flats . He examined the locks ; both were embedded in the woodwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the locks on the far side were probably of the thick bar of steel type so favoured by the security-conscious French , and of the double-locking variety . He would need keys , he realised , of which Mme Berthe would certainly have one for each flat somewhere in her little loge . A few minutes later he was running lightly down the stairs the way88 / t / 89THE DAY OF THE JACKALhe had come . He had been in the block less than five minutes . The concierge was back . He caught a glimpse of her through the frosted glass pane in the door of her cubbyhole , then he had turned and was striding out of the arched entrance . He turned left up the rue de Rennes , passed two other blocks of apartments , then the facade of a post office . At the corner of the block was a narrow street , the rue Littre . He turned into it , still following the wall of the post office . Where the building ended there was a narrow covered alleyway . The Jackal stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sideways down the alley .

On the far side he could make out in the shadows the last rungs of the fire escape of the building he had just left . He had found his escape route . At the end of the rue Littre he turned left again into the rue de Vaugirard and walked back to where it joined the Boulevard de Montparnasse . He had reached the corner and was looking up and down the main street for a free taxi , when a police motorcyclist swept into the road junction , jerked his machine onto its stand , and in the center of the junction began to halt the traffic . By shrill blasts on his whistle he stopped all the traffic coming out of the rue de Vaugirard , as well as that heading down the Boulevard from the direction of the station .

Standing on the corner looking down the length of the Boulevard de Montparnasse , the Jackal saw five-hundredyards away a motorcade sweep into the Duroc junction from the Boulevard des Invalides and start to head towards him . In the lead were two black-leather-clad motorcyclists , white helmetsgleaming in the sun , sirens blaring . Behind them appeared the shark-like snouts of two DS 19 Citroens in the line astern . The policemanin front of the Jackal stood bolt upright facing away from him , left arm gesturing rigidly down towards the Avenue du Maine on theAnatomy of a Plotsouthern side of the junction , right arm bent across the chest , palm downwards , indicating priority passage for the approaching motorcade . Heeling over to the right , the two motorcyclists swept into the Avenue du Maine , followed by the two limousines .

Farther down the road , near the exit from the Duroc Metro station from which she had just emerged , another figure had watched the passing of the President with more than usual interest . She had been about to cross the road when a policeman had waved her back . Seconds later the motorcade swept out of the Boulevard des Invalides across the expanse of cobbles and into the Boulevard de Montparnasse . She too had seen the distinctive profile in the back of the first Citroen , and her eyes had glowed with a passionate fervour . Even when the cars had gone , she stared after them , until she saw the policeman looking her up and down . Hastily she had resumed her crossing of the road . Jacqueline Dumas was then twenty-six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show off to its best advantage , for she worked as a beautician in an expensive salon behind the Champs Elysees . On the evening of July 3o she was hurrying home to her little flat off the Place de Breteuil to get ready for her evening 's elate . Within a few hours she knew she would be naked in the arms of the lover she hated , and she wanted to look her best . A few years earlier the thing that mattered most in her life was her next date . Hers was a good family , a tight-knit group with her father working as a respectable clerk in a banking house , mother being a typical middle-class French housewife and Maman , she finishing her90 / / 91 IfTHE DAY O F THE J A C K A L Anatomy of a Plotbeautician 's course , and Jean-Claude doing his National Service . The family lived in the outer suburb of Le Vesinet , not in the best part , but a nice house all the same . The telegram from the Ministry of the Armed Forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1959  --  It said that the Minister was required with infinite regret to inform Monsieur and Madame ArmandDumas of the death in Algeria of their son Jean-Claude , private soldier in the First Colonial Paratroops . His personal effects would be returned to the bereaved family as soon as possible . For some time Jacqueline 's private world disintegrated . Nothing seemed to make sense , not the quiet security of the family at Le Vesinet or the chatter of the other girls at the salon on the charms of Yves Montand or the latest dance craze imported from America , le Rock . The only thing that seemed to pound through her mind was that little Jean-Claude , her darling baby brother , so vulnerable and gentle , hating war and violence , wanting only to be alone with his books , scarcely more than a boy whom she loved to spoil , had been shot dead in a battle in some God-forsaken wadi in Algeria . She began to hate .

He asked if he could speak to Mademoiselle Jacqueline . She said , " C'est moi-meme " and what did he want ? He replied he commanded the platoon in which one Jean-Claude Dumas , private soldier , had been killed , and he bore a letter . She asked him in . The letter had been written some weeks before Jean-Claude died , and he had kept it in his inside pocket during the patrol in the djebel looking for a band of fellagha who had wiped out a settler family . They had not found the guerrillas , but had run into a battalion of the ALN , the trained troops of the Algerian national movement , the FLN . There had been a bitter skirmish in the half light of dawn andJean-Claude had taken a bullet through the lungs . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jacqueline read the letter and cried a little . It said nothing of the last weeks , just chatter about the barracks at Constantine , the assault courses , and the discipline . The rest she learned from Francois : the pull-back through the scrub for four miles while the outflanking ALN closed in , the repeated calls on the radio for air support , and at eight o'clock the arrival of the fighter-bombers with their screaming engines and thundering rockets . And how her brother , who had volunteered for one of the toughest regiments to prove he was a man , had died like one , coughing blood over the knees of a corporal in the lee of a rock . Francois had been very gentle with her . As a man he was hard as the earth of the colonial province in whose four years of war he had been forged as a professional soldier . But he was very gentle with the sister of one of his platoon . She liked him for that and accepted his offer to dine in Paris . Besides , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not want them to hear how Jean-Claude had died , for both had managed to numb themselves to the loss in the intervening two months and somehow carry on as usual . Over dinner she swore the lieutenant to silence and he agreed . But for her the curiosity became insatiable , to know about the Algerian war , what really happened , what it really stood for , what the politicians were really playing at . General de Gaulle had come to the presidency from the premiership the previous January , swept into the Elysee on a tide of patriotic fervour as the man who would finish the war and still keep Algeria French . It was from Francois that she first heard the man her father adored referred to as a traitor to France . They spent Francois 's leave together , she meeting him every eveningafter work in the salon to which she had gone in January 196o from the training school . He told her of the betrayal of the French Army , of the Paris government 's secret negotiations with the imprisonedAhmed Ben Bella , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Algeria to the melons . He had returned to his war in the second half of January , and she had snatched a brief time alone with him when he managed to get a week 's leave in August in Marseilles. 92 / / 93THE DAY O F THE J A C K A L Anatomy of a PlotShe had waited for him , building him in her private thoughts into the symbol of all that was good and clean and virile in French young manhood . She had waited throughout the autumn and winter of 1960 , with his picture on her bedside table throughout the day and evening , pushed down her nightdress and clasped to her belly while she slept . In his last leave of the spring of 1961 he had come again to Paris , and when they walked down the boulevards , he in uniform , she in her prettiest dress , she thought he was the strongest , broadest , handsomestman in the city . One of the other girls at work had seen them , and the next day the salon was a-buzz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was not there ; she had taken her annual holiday to be with him all the time . Francois was excited . There was something in the wind . The news of the talks with the FLN was public knowledge . The Army , the real Army , would not stand for it much longer , he promised . That Algeria should remain French was , for both of them , the combat-hardened twenty-seven-year-old officer and the adoring twenty-three-year-old mother-to-be , an article of faith . Francois never knew about the baby . He returned to Algeria in March 1961 and on April 21 several units of the French Army mutinied against the Metropolitan government . The First Colonial Paras were in the mutiny almost to a man . Only a handful of conscripts scuttled out of barracks and made rendezvous at the Prefet 's office . The professionalslet them go . Fighting broke out between the mutineers and the loyal regiments within a week . Early in May Francois was shot in a skirmish with a loyalist Army unit . Jacqueline , who had expected no letters from April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July . She quietly took a flat in a cheap suburb of Paris and tried to gas herself . She failed because the room had too many gas leaks , but lost the baby . Her parents took her away with them for their August annual holidays , and she seemed to have recovered by the time they returned . In December she became an active underground worker for the OAS . Her motives were simple : Francois , and after him Jean-Claude . They should be avenged , no matter by what means , no matter whatthe cost to herself or anyone else . Apart from this passion , she was without an ambition in the world . Her only complaint was that she could not do more than run errands , carry messages , occasionally a slab of plastic explosive stuffed into a loaf in her shopping bag . She was convinced she could do more . Did not the " flics " on the corners , carrying out snap searches of passers-by after one of the regular bombings of cafes and cinemas , inevitably let her pass after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her lips ? After the Petit-Clamart affair one of the would-be killers had spent three nights at her flat off the Place de Breteuil while on the run . It had been her big moment , but then he had moved on . A month later he had been caught , but had said nothing of his stay with her . Perhaps he had forgotten . But to be on the safe side , her cell leader instructed her to do no more work for the OAS for a few months , until the heat wore off . It was January 1963 when she began carrying messages again . And so it went on , until in July a man came to see her . He was accompanied by her cell leader , who showed him great deference . He had no name . Would she be prepared to undertake a special job for the Organisation ? Of course . Perhaps dangerous , certainly distasteful ? No matter .

By mid-July they had met , apparently by chance , when she sat next to the man in a restaurant and smiled shyly at him while asking for the loan of the salt cellar on his table . He had spoken , she had been reserved , modest . The reaction had been the right one . Her demurenessinterested him . Without seeming to , the conversation blossomed , the man leading , she docilely following . Within a fortnight they were having an affair . She knew enough about men to be able to judge the basic types of appetites . Her new lover was accustomed to easy conquests , experiencedwomen . She played shy , attentive , but chaste , reserved on the outside with just a hint now and again that her superb body was94 / / 95THE DAY OF THE JACKAL Anatomy of a Plot ; one day not to be completely wasted . The bait worked . For the man the ultimate conquest became a matter of top priority . In late July her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The snag was the man 's wife and two children , who lived with him . On July 29 they left for the family 's country house in the Loire Valley , while the husband was required to stay on in Paris for his work . Within a few minutes of his family 's departure he was on the phone to the salon to insist that Jacqueline and he should dine alone at his flat the following night . Once inside her flat , Jacqueline Dumas glanced at her watch . She had three hours to get ready , and although she intended to be meticu- lous in her preparations , two hours would suffice . She stripped and showered , drying herself in front of the full-length mirror on the back of the wardrobe door , watching the towel run over her skin with unfeeling detachment , raising her arms high to lift the full , rose- nippled breasts with none of the feeling of anticipatory delight she used to feel when she knew they would soon be caressed in Francois 's palms . She thought dully of the coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would , she vowed , she would go through with it , no matter what kind of loving he wanted . From a compartment in the back of the bureau she took her photo of Francois , looking out of the frame with the same old ironic half-smile he had always smiled when he saw her flying the length of the station platform to meet him . The picture 's soft brown hair , the cool buff uniform with the hard-muscled pectorals beneath , against which she loved once long ago to rest her face , and the steel paratrooper 's wings , so cool on a burning cheek . They were all still there  --  in celluloid . She lay on the bed and held Francois above her looking down as he did when they made love , asking superfluously , " Alors , petite , tu veux ? ... " She always whis- pered , " Oui , tu sais bien ... " And then it happened . When she closed her eyes she could feel him inside her , hard and hot and throbbing strength , and hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stifled command " Viens , viens ... " which she never disobeyed . She opened her eyes and stared at the ceiling , holding the warmed glass of the portrait to her breasts . " Francois , " she breathed , " help me , please help me tonight . " On the last day of the month the Jackal was busy . He spent the morning at the Flea Market , wandering from stall to stall with a cheap holdall by his side . He bought a greasy black beret , a pair of wellscuffedshoes , some not-too-clean trousers , and , after much searching , a long once-military greatcoat . He would have preferred one of lighter material , but military greatcoats are seldom tailored for midsummer and in the French Army are made of Duffel . But it was long enough , even on him , stretching to well below the knee , which was the important thing . As he was on his way out , his eye was caught by a stall full of medals , mostly stained with age . He bought a collection , together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures of the ribbons and captions telling the reader for which campaignsor for what kind of acts of gallantry the various medals were awarded . After lunching lightly at Queenie 's on the rue Royale he slipped round the corner to his hotel , paid his bill , and packed . His new purchases went into the bottom of one of his two expensive suitcases . From the collection of medals and with the help of the guide-book he made up a bar of decorations starting with the Medaille Militaire for courage in the face of the enemy , and adding the Medaille de la Liberation and five campaign medals awarded to those who fought in the Free French Forces during the Second World War . He awarded himself decorations for Bir Hakeim , Libya , Tunisia , D-Day , and the Second Armoured Division of General Philippe Leclerc . The rest of the medals , and the book , he dumped separately into two waste paper baskets attached to lamp posts up the Boulevard Malesherbes . The hotel desk clerk informed him there was the excellentEtoile du Nord express for Brussels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught , and dined well , arriving in Brussels in the last hours of July. 96 / / 97Q SIX 1 The letter for Viktor Kowalski arrived in Rome the following morn- ing . The giant corporal was crossing the foyer of the hotel on his return from picking up the daily mail from the post office when one of the bell-hops called after him , " Signor , per favore ... " He turned , as surly as ever . The wop was one he did not recognise , but there was nothing unusual in that . He never noticed them as he bulled his way across the floor of the foyer towards the lift . The dark-eyed young man held a letter in his hand as he came to Kowal- ski 's side . " E una lettera , signor . Per un Signor Kowalski . . . non cognosco questo signor . . . . E forse un francese ... " Kowalski did not understand a word of the babble of Italian , but he got the sense and he recognised his own name , badly pronounced though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hand and stared at the scrawled name and address . He was registered under another name , and not being a reading man had failed to notice that five days earlier a Paris newspaper had had a scoop announcing that three of the top men of the OAS were now holed up on the top floor of the hotel . So far as he was concerned , no one was supposed to know where he was . And yet the letter intrigued him . He did not often receive letters , and as with most simple people the arrival of one was an important event . He had cottoned from the Italian , now standing with spaniel eyes by his side staring up as if he , Kowalski , was the fount of human knowledge who would solve the dilemma , that none of the desk staff had heard of a guest of that name and did not know what to do with the letter . Kowalski looked down . " Bon . Je vais demander , " he said loftily . The Italian 's brow did not uncrease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upwards through the ceiling . The Italian saw the light . " Ah , si . Domandare . Prego , Signor . Tante grazie ... " Kowalski strode away leaving the Italian gesticulating his gratitude . Taking the lift to the eighth floor , he emerged to find himself confronted by the desk-duty man in the corridor , automatic drawn and cocked . For a second the two stared at each other . Then the other slipped on the safety catch and pocketed the gun . He could see only Kowalski , no one else in the lift . It was purely routine , happening every time the lights above the lift doors indicated that the ascending lift was coming beyond the seventh floor . Apart from the desk-duty man , there was another facing the fire escape door at the end of the corridor and another at the head of the stairs . Both the stairs and the fire escape were booby-trapped , although the management did not know this , and the booby-traps could be rendered harmless only when the current to the detonators was cut off from a switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the day shift was on the roof above the ninth floor where the chiefs lived , but in case of attack there were three others now asleep in their rooms down the corridor who had been on night shift , but who would awake and be operational in a few seconds if anything happened . On the eighth floor the lift doors had been welded closed from the outside , but even if the light above the lift on the eighth floor indicated the lift was heading right for the top it was a sign for a general alarm . It had only happened once and then by accident , when a bell-hop delivering a tray of drinks had pressed the98 / / 99THE DAY OF THE JACKALbutton for " Nine . " He had been quickly discouraged from this practice . The desk man telephoned upstairs to announce the arrival of the mail , then signalled to Kowalski to go up . The ex-corporal had alreadystuffed the letter addressed to himself into his inside pocket while the mail for his chiefs was in a steel case chained to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the flat case were spring-loaded , and only Rodin had the keys . A few minutes later the OAS colonel had unlocked both , and Kowalski returned to his room to sleep before relieving the desk man in the late afternoon . In his room back on the eighth floor he finally read his letter , starting with the signature . He was surprised that it should be from Kovacs , whom he had not seen for a year and who hardly knew how to write , as Kowalski had some difficulty in reading . But by dint of application he deciphered the letter . It was not long . Kovacs began by saying that he had seen a newspaper story on the day of writing , which a friend had read aloud to him , saying that Rodin , Montclair , and Casson were hiding at that hotel in Rome . He had supposed his old friend Kowalski would be with them , hence was writing on the offchance of reaching him . Several paragraphs followed to the effect that things were getting tough in France these days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still coming through for smash-and-grab raids on jewellers . He had personally been in four , said Kovacs , and it was no joke , particularly when one had to hand over the proceeds . He had done better in Budapest in the good old days , even though these had only lasted for a fortnight . The last paragraph recounted that Kovacs had met Michel some weeks before , and Michel had said that he had been talking to JoJo , who had said little Sylvie was sick with Luke-something ; anyway it was to do with her blood having gone wrong , but that he Kovacs hoped she would soon be all right and Viktor should not worry . But Viktor did worry . It worried him badly to think that little Sylvie was ill . There was not a great deal that had ever penetrated into the heart of Viktor Kowalski in his thirty-six violent years . He had100 /Anatomy of a plotbeen twelve years old when the Germans invaded Poland and one year older when his parents were taken away in a dark van . Old enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel behind the cathedral that had been taken over by the Germans and was visited by so many of their officers , which so upset his parents that they protested to the military governor 's office . Old enough to join the partisans . He had killed his first German at fifteen . He was seventeen when the Russians came , but his parents had always hated and feared them , and told him terrible tales about what they did to Poles , so he left the partisans , who were later executed on orders of the commissar , and went westwards like a hunted animal towards Czechoslovakia . Later it was Augtria and a Displaced Persons camp for the tall raw-boned gangling yputh who spoke only Polish and was weak from hunger . They thought he was another of the harmless flotsam of post-war Europe . On An1ericanfood his strength returned . He broke out one spring night in 1946 and hitched south towards Italy , and thence into France in company with another Pole he had met in DP camp who spoke French , In Marseilles he broke into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbed him , and was on the run again . His companion left him , advising Viktor there was only one place to go  --  the Foreign Legion . He signed on the next morning and was in Sidi-Bel-Abbes before the police investigation in war-torn Marseilles was really off the ground . The Mediterranean city was still a big import-base for American foodstuffs , and murders committed for these foodstuffs were not uncommon . The case was dropped in a few days when no immediate suspect came to light . By the time he learned this , however , Kowalski was a legionnaire . He was nineteen and at first the old sweats called him " petit bonhomme . " Then he showed them how he could kill , and they called him Kowalski . Six years in Indochina finished off what might have been left in him of a normally adjusted individual , and after that Kowalski was Sent to Algeria . In between he had a posting to a weapons training course for six months outside Marseilles . There he met Julie , a tiny but vicious scrubber in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 101THE DAY OF THE JACKAL Anatomy of a Plother mec . Kowalski knocked the man six metres across the bar and out cold for ten hours with one blow . The man enunciated oddly for years afterwards , so badly was the lower mandible shattered . Julie liked the enormous legionnaire , and for several months he became her " protector " by night , escorting her home after work to the sleazy attic in the Vieux Port . There was a lot of lust , particularly on her side , but no love between them , and even less when she discoveredshe was pregnant . The child , she told him , was his , and he may have believed it because he wanted to . She also told him she did not want the baby , and knew an old woman who would get rid of it for her . Kowalski clouted her and told her if she did that he would kill her . Three months later he had to return to Algeria . In the meantime he had become friendly with another Polish ex-legionnaire , Josef Grzybowski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invalided out of Indochina and had settled with a jolly widow running a snack-stall on wheels up and down the platforms at the main station . Since their marriage in 1953 they had run it together , JoJo limping along behind his wife taking the money and giving out the change while his wife dispensed the snacks . On the evenings when he was not working , JoJo liked to frequent the bars haunted by the legionnaires from the nearby barracks to talk over old times . Most of them were youngsters , recruitssince his own days at Tourane , Indochina , but one evening he ran into Kowalski . It was to JoJo that Kowalski had turned for advice about the baby . JoJo agreed with him . They had both been Catholics once . " She wants to have the kid done in , " said Viktor . " Salope , " said JoJo . " Cow , " agreed Viktor . They drank some more , staring moodily into the mirror at the back of the bar . " Not fair to the kid , " said Viktor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never had a kid before , " said Viktor after some thought . " Nor me , even being married and all , " replied JoJo . Somewhere in the small hours of the morning , very drunk , they agreed on their plan and drank to it with the solemnity of the trulyintoxicated . The next morning JoJo remembered his pledge , but could not think how to break the news to Madame . It took him three days . tie skated warily round the subject once or twice , then blurted it out while he and the missis were in bed . To his amazement , Madame was delighted . And so it was arranged . In due course Viktor returned to Algeria , then to rejoin Major Rodin , who now commanded the battalion , and to a new war . In Marseilles JoJo and his wife , by a mixture of threats and cajolement , supervised the pregnant Julie . By the time Viktor left Marseilles she was already four months gone and it was too late for an abortion , as JoJo menacingly pointed out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . This individual had become wary of crossing legionnaires , even old veterans with gammy legs , so he obscenelyforeswore his former source of income and looked elsewhere . Julie was brought to bed in late 1955 and produced a girl , blue-eyed and golden-haired . Adoption papers were duly filed by JoJo and his wife , with the concurrence of Julie . The adoption went through . Julie went back to her old life , and the JoJos had themselves a daughter , whom they named Sylvie . They informed Viktor by letter , and in his barracks bed he was strangely pleased . But he did not tell anyone . He had never actually owned anything within his memory that , if revealed , had not been taken away from him . Nevertheless , three years later , before a long combat mission in the Algerian hills , the chaplain had proposed to him that he might like to make a will . The idea had never even occurred to him before . He had never had anything to leave behind for one thing , since he spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cities when given his rare periods of leave , and what he had belonged to the Legion . But the chaplain assured him that in the modern Legion a will was perfectly in order , so with considerable assistance he made one , leaving all his worldly goods and chattels to the daughter of one Josef Grzybowski , former legionnaire , presently of Marseilles . Eventually a copy of this document , along with the rest of his dossier , was filed with the archives of the Ministry of the Armed Forces in Paris . When Kowalski 's name became known to the French security forces inTHE DAY OF THE JACKAL Anatomy of a Plotconnection with the Bone and Constantine terrorism in 1961 , this dossier was unearthed along with many others and came to the attention of Colonel Rolland 's Action Service at the Porte des Lilas . A visit was paid to the Grzybowskis , and the story came out . Kowalski never learned this . He saw his daughter twice in his life , once in 1957 after taking a bullet in the thigh and being sent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came to the city when on escort duty for Lieutenant Colonel Rodin , who had to attend a court martial as a witness . The first time the little girl was two , the next time four and a half . Kowalski arrived laden with presents for the JoJos and toys for Sylvie . They got on very well together , the small child and her bear-like Uncle Viktor . But he never mentioned her to anyone else , not even Rodin . And now she was sick with Luke-something , and Kowalski worried a lot throughout the rest of the morning . After lunch he was upstairs to have the steel etui for the mail chained to his wrist . Rodin was expecting an important letter from France containing further details of the total sum of money amassed by the series of robberies , and he wanted Kowalski to pay a second visit to the post office for the afternoon mail arrivals . " What , " the corporal suddenly blurted out , " is Luke-something ? " Rodin , attaching the chain to his wrist , looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he replied . " It 's a malady of the blood , " explained Kowalski . From the other side of the room where he was reading a glossy magazine Casson laughed . " Leukaemia , you mean , " he said . " Well , what is it , monsieur ? " " It 's cancer , " replied Casson , " cancer of the blood . " Kowalski looked at Rodin in front of him . He did not trust civilians . " They can cure it , the toubibs , mon colonel ? " " No , Kowalski , it 's fatal . There 's no cure . Why ? " " Nothing , " mumbled Kowalski , " just something I read . " Then he left . If Rodin was surprised that his bodyguard who had never been known to read anything more complex than standing orders of the day had come across that word in a book , he did not show it and the matter was soon swept from his mind . For the afternoon 's mail brought the letter he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts in Switzerland now contained over $ 250,000 . Rodin was satisfied as he sat down to write and despatch the instructions to the bankers transferring that sum to the account of his hired assassin . For the balance he had no qualms . With President de Gaulle dead , there would be no delay before the industrialists and bankers of the extreme Right-wing , who had financed the OAS in its earlier and more successful days , produced the other 250,000 . The same men who had replied to his approaches for a further advance of cash only a few weeks earlier with mealy-mouthed excuses that the " lack of progress and initiative shown over recent months by the forces of patriotism " had decreased their chances of ever seeing a return on previous investments , would be clamouring for the honour of backing the soldiers who shortly afterwards would become the new rulers of a re-born France . He finished the instructions to the bankers as darkness fell , but when he saw the orders Rodin had written instructing the Swiss bankers to pay over the money to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important thing they had all three promised their Englishman was that he would have a contact in Paris capable of supplying him constantly with the latest accurate information about the movements of the French President , along with any changes in the security routines surrounding him that might occur . These could , indeed probably would , be of vital importance to the assassin . To inform him of the transfer of the money at this stage , Casson reasoned , would be to encourage him to go into action prematurely . Whenever the man intended to strike was obviously his own choice , but a few extra days would make no difference . What might very well make a difference between success and another , certainly the last , failure would be the question of information provided to the killer. 104 / / 105THE DAY OF THE JACKAL Anatomy of a PlotHe , Casson , had received word that very morning in the mail that his chief representative in Paris had succeeded in placing an agent very close to one of the men in de Gaulle 's immediate entourage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in a position to acquire consistently reliable information as to the General 's whereaboutsand above all his travelling intentions and his public appearances , neither of which were being publicly announced in advance any more . Would Rodin therefore please stay his hand for a few more days until Casson was in a position to supply the assassin with a telephone number in Paris from which he could receive the information that would be vital to his mission ? Rodin reflected long over Casson 's argument , and eventually agreed that he was right . Neither man could be aware of the Jackal 's intentions , and in fact the transmission of the instructions to the bankers , followed later by the letter to London containing the Paris telephone number , would not have caused the assassin to alter any detail of his schedule . Neither terrorist in Rome could know that the killer had already chosen his day and was proceeding with his planningand contingency precautions with clockwork precision . Sitting up on the roof in the hot Roman night , his bulky form merging into the shadow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily in a practised hand , Kowalski worried about a little girl in a bed in Marseilles with Luke-something in her blood . Shortly before dawn he had an idea . He remembered that the last time he had seen JoJo in 1960 , the ex-legionnaire had talked of getting a telephone in his flat . On the morning that Kowalski received his letter , the Jackal left the Amigo hotel in Brussels and took a taxi to a corner of the street where M. Goossens lived . He had rung the armourer over breakfast in the name of Duggan , which was how Goossens knew him , and the appointment was for 11 a.m . He arrived at the corner of the street at 10:30 and spent half an hour surveying the street from behind a newspaper on a kerbside bench in the little public gardens at the end of the street . It seemed quiet enough . He presented himself at the door at 11sharp , and Goossens let him in and led him to the little office off the hallway . After the Jackal had passed , M. Goossens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain . Inside the office the Englishman turned to the armourer . " Any problems ? " he asked . The Belgian looked embarrassed . " Well , yes , I am afraid so . " The assassin surveyed him coldly , with no expression on his face , the eyes half closed and sullen . " You told me that if I came back on August i I could have the gun by August 4 to take home with me , " he said . " That 's perfectly true , and I assure you the problem is not with the gun , " said the Belgian . " Indeed the gun is ready , and frankly I regard it as one of my masterpieces , a beautiful specimen . The trouble has been with the other product , which evidently had to be made from scratch . Let me show you . " On top of the desk lay a flat case about two feet long by eighteen inches broad four inches deep . M. Goossens opened the case and the Jackal looked down on it as the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flat tray , divided into carefully shaped compartments , each exactly the shape of the component of the rifle that it contained . " It was not the original case , you understand , " explained M. Goossens . " That would have been much too long . I made the case myself . It all fits . " It fitted very compactly . Along the top of the open tray was the barrel and breech , the whole no longer than eighteen inches . The Jackal lifted it out and examined it . It was very light , and looked rather like a submachine gun barrel . The breech contained a narrow bolt which was closed shut . It ended at the back with a knurled grip no larger than the breech into which the rest of the bolt was fitted . The Englishman took the knurled end of the bolt between forefinger and thumb of the right hand , gave it a sharp turn anti-clockwise . The bolt unlocked itself and rolled over in its groove . As he pulled the bolt slid back to reveal the gleaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark hole at the rear end of the barrel . He rammed the bolt back home and twisted it clockwise . Smoothly it locked into place . THE DAY OF THE JACKAL Anatomy of a PlotJust below the rear end of the bolt an extra disc of steel had been expertly welded onto the mechanism . It was half an inch thick but less than an inch round , and in the top part of the disc was a cutout crescent to allow free passage backwards of the bolt . In the centre of the rear face of the disc was a single hole half an inch across ; the inside of this hole had been threaded as if to take a screw . " That 's for the frame of the stock , " said the Belgian quietly . Jackal noticed that where the wooden stock of the original rifle had been removed no trace remained except the slight flanges running along the underside of the breech where the woodwork had once fitted . The two holes made by the retaining screws that had secured the wooden stock to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rifle over and examined the underside . There was a narrow slit beneath the breech . Through it he could see the underside of the bolt that contained the firing pin which fired the bullet . Through both slits protruded the stump of the trigger . It had been sawn off flush with the surface of the steel breech . Welded to the stump of the old trigger was a tiny knob of metal , also with a threaded hole in it . Silently M. Goossens handed him a small sliver of steel , an inch long , curved and with one end threaded . He fitted the threaded end into the hole and twiddled it quickly with forefinger and thumb . When it was tight the new trigger protruded below the breech . By his side the Belgian reached back into the tray and held up a single narrow steel rod , one end of it threaded . " The first part of the stock assembly , " he said . The assassin fitted the end of the steel rod into a hole at the rear of the breech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steel rod seemed to emerge from the back of the gun and cant downwards at thirty degrees . Two inches from the threaded end , up near the mech- anism of the rifle , the steel rod had been lightly flattened , and in the centre of the flattened portion a hole had been drilled at an angle to the line of the rod . This hole now faced directly backwards . Goossens held up a second and shorter steel rod . " The upper strut , " he said . 108 / / 109This too was fitted into place . The two rods stuck out backwards , the upper one at a much shallower angle to the line of the barrel so that the two rods separated from each other like two sides of a narrow triangle with no base . Goossens produced the base . It was curved , about five or six inches long , and heavily padded with black leather . At each end of the shoulder guard , or butt of the rifle , was a small hole . " There 's nothing to screw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it onto the ends of the rods . " The Englishman fitted the end of each steel rod into the appropriate hole and smacked the butt home . The rifle now , when seen in profile , looked more normal , with a trigger and a complete stock sketched in outline by the upper and lower strut and the base plate . The Jackal lifted the butt-plate into his shoulder , left hand gripping the underside of the barrel , right forefinger round the trigger , left eye closed , and right eye squinting down the barrel . He aimed at the far wall and squeezed the trigger . There was a soft click from inside the breech . He turned to the Belgian , who held what looked like a ten-inch long black tube in each hand . " Silencer , " said the Englishman . He took the proffered tube and studied the end of the rifle barrel . It had been finely " tapped " or threaded . He slipped the wider end of the silencer over the barrel and wound it quickly round and round until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the barrel like a long sausage . He held his hand out from his side and M. Goossens slipped the telescopic sight into it . Along the top of the barrel were a series of pairs of grooves gouged into the metal . Into these the sprung clips on the underside of the telescope fitted , ensuring the telescopic sight and the barrel were exactly parallel . On the right hand side and on the top of the telescope were tiny grub screws for adjusting the crossed hairs inside the sight . Again the Englishman held up the rifle and squinted as he took aim . To a casual glance he might have been an elegant , check-suited Englishgentleman in a Piccadilly gunshop trying out a new sporting gun . But what had been ten minutes before a handful of odd-looking'I'H F. 1 ) AY OF THE JACKAL . Anatomy of a Plotcomponents was no sporting gun any more ; it was a high-velocity , long-range , fully silenced assassin 's rifle . The Jackal put it down . He turned to the Belgian and nodded , satisfied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I congratulate you . A beautiful piece of work . " M. Goossens beamed . " There still remains the question of zeroing the sights and firing some practise shots . Do you have any shells ? " The Belgian reached into the drawer of the desk and pulled out a box of a hundred bullets . The seals of the packet had been broken , and six shells were missing . " These are for practice , " said the armourer . " I have taken six others out for converting them to explosive tips . " The Jackal poured a handful of the shells into his hand and looked at them . They seemed terribly small for the job one of them would have to do , but he noticed they were the extra long type of that calibre , the extra explosive charge giving the bullet a very high velocity and consequently increased accuracy and killing power . The tips too were pointed , where most hunting bullets are snug-nosed , and where huntingbullets have a dull leaden head , these were tipped with cupronickel . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting gun he held . " Where are the real shells ? " asked the assassin . M. Goossens went to the desk again and produced a screw of tissue paper . " Normally , of course , I keep these in a very safe place , " he explained , " but since I knew you were coming , I got them out . " He undid the screw of paper and poured the contents out onto the white blotter . At first glance the bullets looked the same as those the Englishman was pouring from his cupped hand back into the cardboard box . When he had finished he took one of the bullets off the blotter and examined it closely . From a small area around the extreme tip of the bullet the cupronickelhad been finely sanded away to expose the lead inside . The sharp tip of the bullet had been slightly blunted , and into the nose atiny hole had been drilled down the length of the nose-cap for a quarter of an inch . Into this aperture a droplet of mercury was poured , then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the lead had hardened , it too was filed and papered until the original pointed shape of the bullet tip had been exactly re-created . The Jackal knew about these bullets , although he had never had occasion ' to use one . Far too complex to be used en masse except if factory-produced , banned by the Geneva Convention , more vicious than the simple dum-dum , the explosive bullet would go off like a small grenade when it hit the human body . On firing , the droplet of mercury would be slammed back in its cavity by the forward rush of the bullet , as when a car passenger is pressed into his seat by a violent acceleration . As soon as the bullet struck flesh , gristle , or bone , it would experience a sudden deceleration . The effect on the mercury would be to hurl the droplet forwards towards the plugged front of the bullet . Here its onward rush would rip away the tip of the slug , splaying the lead outwards like the fingers of an open hand or the petals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would tear through nerve and tissue , ripping , cutting , slicing , leaving fragments of itself over an area the size of a tea-saucer . Hitting the head , such a bullet would not emerge , but would demolish everything inside the cranium , forcing the bone-shell to fragment . The assassin put the bullet carefully back on the tissue paper . Beside him the mild little man who had designed it was looking up at him quizzically . " They look all right to me . You are evidently a craftsman , M. Goossens . What then is the problem ? " " It is the other , monsieur . The tubes . These have been more difficult to fabricate than I had imagined . First I used aluminum as you suggested . But please understand I acquired and perfected the gun first . That is why I only got around to doing the other things a few days ago . I had hoped it would be relatively simple , with my skill and the machinery I have in my workshop . " But in order to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAY OF THE JACKAL Anatomy of a Plotthin metal . It was too thin . When threaded on my machine for later assembly piece by piece , it was like tissue paper . It bent when the slightest pressure was put upon it . In order to keep the inside measurementsbig enough to accommodate the breech of the rifle at its widest part , and yet get thicker-metalled tubes , I had to produce something that simply would not look natural . So I decided on stainless steel . " It was the only thing . It looks just like aluminum , but slightly heavier . Being stronger , it can be thinner . It can take the thread and still be tough enough not to bend . Of course , it is a harder metal to work , and it takes time . I began yesterday ... " " All right . What you say is logical . The point is , I need it , and I need it perfect . When ? " The Belgian shrugged . " It is difficult to say . I have all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I doubt . I am certain the last technical problems are licked . Five days , six days . A week perhaps ... " The Englishman showed no signs of his annoyance . The face remainedimpassive , studying the Belgian as he completed his explanations . When he finished , the other was still thinking . " All right , " he said at last . " It will mean an alteration of my travelling plans . But perhaps not as serious as I thought the last time I was here . That depends to a certain degree on the results of a telephone call I shall have to make . In any event , it will be necessary for me to acclimatise myself to the gun , and that may as well be done in Belgium as anywhere else . But I shall need the gun and the undoctoredshells , plus one of the doctored ones . Also , I shall need some peace and quiet in which to practise . Where would one pick in this country to test a new rifle in conditions of complete secrecy ? Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the open air ? " M. Goossens thought for a moment . " In the forest of the Ardennes , " he said at length . " There are great reaches of forest there where a man may be alone for several hours . You could be there and back in a day . Today is Thursday , the weekend starts tomorrow and the woods might be too full of people picnicking . I would suggest Monday , the fifth . By Tuesday or Wednesday , I hope to have the rest of the job finished . " The Englishman nodded , satisfied . " All right . I think I had better take the gun and the ammunition now . I shall contact you again on Tuesday or Wednesday next week . " The Belgian was about to protest when the customer forestalled him . " I believe I still owe you some seven hundred pounds . Here "  --  he dropped another few bundles of notes onto the blotter  --  " is a further five hundred . The outstanding two hundred pounds you will receive when I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monsieur , " said the armourer , scooping the five bundles of twenty five-pound notes into his pocket . Piece by piece he disassembledthe rifle , placing each component carefully into its green baizelinedcompartment in the carrying case . The single explosive bullet the assassin had asked for was wrapped in a separate piece of tissue paper and slotted into the case beside the cleaning rags and brushes . When the case was closed , he proffered it and the box of shells to the Englishman , who pocketed the shells and kept the neat attache case in his hand . M. Goossens showed him politely out . The Jackal arrived back at his hotel in time for a late lunch . First he placed the case containing the gun carefully in the bottom of the wardrobe , locked it , and pocketed the key . In the afternoon he strolled unhurriedly into the main post office and asked for a call to a number in Zurich , Switzerland . It took half an hour for the call to be put through and another five minutes until Herr Meier came on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number and then giving his name . Herr Meier excused himself and came back two minutes later . His tone had lost the cautious reserve it had previously had . Customers whose accounts in dollars and Swiss francs grew steadily merited courteous treatment . The man in Brussels asked one question , and again the Swiss banker excused himself , this time to be back on the line in less than thirty seconds . He had evidently had the customer 's file and statement brought out of the safe and was studying it . " No , mein Herr , " the voice crackled into the Brussels phone booth . " We have here your letter of instruction requiring us to inform you112 / / 113THE DAY OF THE JACKAL Anatomy of a Plotby letter express airmail the moment any fresh in-payments are made , but there have been none over the period you mention . " " I only wondered , Herr Meier , because I have been away from London for two weeks and it might have come in my absence . " " No , there has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall inform you without delay . " In a flurry of Herr Meier 's good wishes , the Jackal put the phone down , settled the amount charged , and left . He met the forger in the bar off the rue Neuve that evening , arriving shortly after 6 . The man was there already , and the Englishman spotted a corner seat still free , ordered the forger to join him with a jerk of his head . A few seconds after he had sat down and lit a cigarette , the Belgian joined him . " Finished ? " asked the Englishman . " Yes , all finished . And very good work , even if I do say so myself . " The Englishman held out his hand . " Show me , " he ordered . The Belgian lit one of his Bastos and shook his head . " Please understa , td , monsieur , this is a very public place . Also one needs a good light to examine them , particularly the French cards . They are at the studio . " Jackal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right . We 'll go and have a look at them in private . " They left the bar a few minutes later and took a taxi to the corner of the street where the basement studio was situated . It was still a warm , sunny evening , and though the street was narrow and no sun percolated , the Englishman wore the wraparound dark glasses to avoid recognition . One old man passed them coming the other way , but he was bent with arthritis and shuffled with his head to the ground . The forger led the way down the steps and unlocked the door from a key on his ring . Inside the studio it was almost as dark as if it were night outside . A few shafts of dullish daylight filtered between the ghastly photographs stuck to the inside of the window beside the door , so that the Englishman could make out the shapes of the chair andtable in the outer office . The forger led the way through the two velvet curtains into the studio and switched on the centre light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envelope , tipped it open , and spread the contents on the small round mahogany table that stood to one side , a prop for the taking of portrait photographs . The table he then lifted over to the centre of the room and placed it under the centre light . The twin arc lamps above the tiny stage at the far back of the studio remained unlit . " Please , monsieur . " He smiled broadly and gestured towards the three cards lying on the table . The Englishman picked the first up and held it under the light . It was his driving licence , the first page covered by a stuck-on tab of paper . This informed the reader that Mr. Alexander James Quentin Duggan of London W.I. is hereby licensed to drive motor vehicles of Groups 1a , ib , 2 , 3 , 12 , and 13 only from to DEC 1960 until 9 DEC 1963 inclusive . Above this was the licence number ( an imaginary one of course ) and the words " London County Council " and " Road Traffic Act 1960 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fee of 15/  --  received . " So far as Jackal could tell , it was a perfec , t forgery , 2rtainly good enough for his purposes . The second card was simply a French carte d'identite in the name of Andre Martin , aged fifty-three , born at Colmar and residentin Paris . His own photograph , aged by twenty years , with iron-grey hair cut en brosse , muzzy and embarrassed , stared out of a tiny corner of the card . The card itself was stained and dogeared , a working man 's card . The third specimen drew his closest attention . The photograph on it was slightly different from the one on the I.D . card , for the date of issue of each card was different by several months , since the renewal dates would probably not have coincided precisely , had they been real . The card bore another portrait of himself that had been taken nearly two weeks earlier , but the shirt seemed to be darker and there was a hint of stubble round the chin of the photo on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by skilful retouching , giving the impression of two different photo-114 / / 115THE DAY O F THE J A C K A L Anatomy of a Plotgraphs of the same man , taken at different times and in different clothes . In both cases the draughtsmanship of the forger was excellent . Jackal looked up and pocketed the cards . " Very nice , " he said . " Just what I wanted . I congratulate you . There is fifty pounds outstanding , I believe . " " That is true , monsieur . Merci . " The forger waited expectantly for the money . The Englishman drew a single wad of ten five-pound notes from his pocket but held them extended between forefinger and thumb . He said , " I believe there is something more , no ? " The Belgian tried unsuccessfully to look as if he did not comprehend . " Monsieur ? " " The genuine front page of the driving licence . The one I said I wanted back . " There could be no doubt now that the forger was acting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thought had just occurredto him , and turned away . He walked several paces one way , head bowed as if deep in thought , hands held behind his back . Then he turned and walked back . " I thought we might be able to have a little chat about that piece of paper , monsieur . " " Yes ? " The Jackal 's tone gave nothing away . It was flat , without expression , apart from a slight interrogative . The face said nothing either , and the eyes seemed half shrouded as if they stared only into their own private world . " The fact is , monsieur , that the original front page of the driving licence , with , I imagine , your real name on it , is not here . Oh , please , please "  --  he made an elaborate gesture as if to reassure one seized by anxiety , which the Englishman gave no sense of being  --  " it is in a very safe place . In a private deed box in a bank , which can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monsieur , a man in my precarious line of business has to take precautions , take out , if you like some form of insurance . " " What do you want ? " " Now , my dear sir , I had hoped that you might be prepared to dobusiness on the basis of an exchange of ownership of that piece of paper , business based on a sum somewhat above the last figure of a hundred and fifty pounds which we mentioned in this room . " The Englishman sighed softly , as if slightly puzzled by the ability of man to complicate unnecessarily his own existence on this earth . He gave no other sign that the proposal of the Belgian interested him . " You are interested ? " asked the forger , coyly . He was playing his part as if he had rehearsed it at length ; the oblique approach , the supposedly subtle hints . It reminded the other of a bad B-picture . " I have met blackmailers before , " said the Englishman , not an accusation , just a flat statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ah , monsieur , I beg you . Blackmail ? Me ? What I propose is not blackmail , since that is a process that repeats itself . I propose simply a trade . The whole package for a certain sum of money . After all , I have in my deed box the original of your licence , the developed plates , and all the negatives of the photographs I took of you , and , I am afraid "  --  he made a regretful grimace to show he was afraid  --  " one other picture taken of you very quickly while you were standing under the arc lights without your makeup . I am sure these documents , in the hands of the British and French authorities , could cause you some inconvenience . You are evidently a man accustomed to paying in order to avoid the inconveniences of life  --  " " How much ? " " One thousand pounds , monsieur . " The Englishman considered the proposition , nodding quietly as if it was of mild academic interest only . " It would be worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he conceded . The Belgian grinned triumphantly . " I am most glad to hear it , monsieur . " " But the answer is no , " went on the Englishman as if he were still thinking hard . The Belgian 's eyes narrowed . " But why ? I do not understand . You say it is worth a thousand116 / / 117THE DAY OF THE JACKAL Anatomy of a Plotpounds to you to have them back . It is a straight deal . We are both used to dealing in desirable property and being paid for it . " " There are two reasons , " said the other mildly . " Firstly , I have no evidence whatever that the original negatives of the photographs have not been copied , so that the first demand would not be succeeded by others . Nor have I any evidence that you have not given the documentsto a friend , who , when asked to produce them will suddenly decide that he no longer has them , unless he too is sweetened to the tune of another thousand pounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that worries you , your fears are groundless . It would be in my interest not to entrust the documents to any partner , for fear that he might not produce them . I do not imagine you would part with a thousand pounds without receiving the documents . So there is no reason for me to part with them . I repeat , they are in a bank deposit box . " From the point of view of repeated requests for money , that would not make sense . A photostat copy of the driving licence would not impress the British authorities , and even if you were caught with a false driving licence , it would only cause you some inconvenience , but not enough to justify several payments of money to me . As for the French cards , if the French authorities were informed that a certain Englishman were masquerading as a non-existent Frenchman called Andre Martin , they might indeed arrest you if you passed in France under that name . But if I were to make repeated requests for money , it would become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another forger to make you a new set . Then you would no longer need to fear exposure while in France as Andre Martin , since Martin would have ceased to exist . " " Then why can not I do that now ? " asked the Englishman , " since another complete set would cost me probably no more than an extra hundred and fifty pounds ? " The Belgian gestured with hands apart , palms upwards . " I am banking on the fact that convenience and the time element to you are worth money . I think you need those Andre Martin papers and my silence in not too long a time . To get another set made wouldinvolve a lot more time , and they would not be as good . Those you have are perfect . So you want the papers , and my silence , and both now . The papers you have . My silence costs a thousand pounds . " " Very well , since you put it like that . But what makes you think I have a thousand pounds right here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who knows all the answers but has no rooted objections to exposing them to satisfy the whims of a close friend . " Monsieur , you are an English gentleman . It is clear to all . Yet you wish to pass for a middle-aged French working man . Your French is fluent and almost without accent . That is why I put the birthplace of Andre Martin as Colmar . You know , Alsatians speak French with a trace of accent like your own . You pass through France disguised as Andre Martin . Perfect , a stroke of genius . Who would ever think of searching an old man like Martin ? So whatever you are carrying on you must be valuable . Drugs perhaps ? Very fashionable in certain smart English circles these days . And Marseilles is one of the main supply centres . Or diamonds ? I do not know . But the business you are in is profitable . English milordsdo not waste their time with picking pockets on racecourses . Please , monsieur , we stop playing games , hein ? You telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand pounds to you at the bank here . Then tomorrow night we exchange packagesand  --  hop  --  you are on your way , not so ? " The Englishman nodded several times , as if in rueful contemplation of a past life full of errors . Suddenly he raised his head and smiled engagingly at the Belgian . It was the first time the forger had seen him smile , and he felt enormously relieved that this quiet Englishman had taken the matter so calmly without the usual twisting around to seek an outlet . But in the long run no problems . The man had come around . He felt the tension drain out of him . " Very well , " said the Englishman , " you win . I can have a thousandpounds here by noon tomorrow . But there is one condition . " " Condition ? " At once the Belgian was wary again. 118 / / 119THE DAY OF THE JACKAL Anatomy of a Plot " We do not meet here . " The forger was baffled . " There is nothing wrong with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is everything wrong with this place from my point of view . You have just told me that you took a clandestine picture of me here . I do not wish our little ceremony of handing over our respective packages to be interrupted by the quiet click of a camera from some concealed point where one of your friends has thoughtfully hidden himself . . . " The Belgian 's relief was visible . He laughed aloud . " You need have no fears of that , cher ami . This place is mine , very discreet , and nobody comes in here unless they are invited in by me . One has to be discreet , you understand , for I make a sideline from here in taking pictures for the tourists , you know , very popular but not quite the kind of work one does in a studio on the Grand ' Place . " He held up his left hand , the forefinger and thumb forming the letter 0 , and ran the extended forefinger of the right hand through the circular aperture several times to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes twinkled . He grinned wide , then started to laugh . The Belgian laughed too at the joke . The Englishman clapped his hands against the Belgian 's upper arms , and the fingers tightened on the biceps muscles , holding the forger steady , his hands still going through their erotic gestures . The Belgian was still laughing when he got the impression that his private parts had been hit by an express train . The head jerked forward , the hands discontinued their mime and dropped downwards to the crushed testicles from which the man who held him had withdrawn his right knee , and the laugh turned to a screech , a gurgle , a retch . Half unconscious , he slithered to his knees , then tried to roll forwards and sideways to lie on the floor and nurse himself . The Jackal let him slip quite gently to his knees . Then he stepped round and over the fallen figure , straddling the exposed back of the Belgian . His right hand slipped round and past the Belgian 's neck and with it he gripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the back of the forger 's head . He gave one short , vicious twist to the neck , backwards , upwards , and sideways . The crack as the cervical column snapped was probably not very loud , but in the quiet of the studio it sounded like a small pistol going off . The forger 's body gave one last contraction , then slumped as limp as a rag doll . The Jackal held on for a moment longer before letting the body fall face down on the floor . The dead face twisted sideways , hands buried beneath the hips still clutching the privates , tongue protruding slightly between the clenched teeth , half bitten through , eyes open and staring at the faded pattern of the linoleum . The Englishman walked quickly across to the curtains to make sure they were closed completely , then went back to the body . He turned it over and patted the pockets , finding the keys eventually in the left-hand side of the trousers . In the far corner of the studio stood the large trunk of props and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lid , and he spent ten minutes removing the contents and piling them in untidy heaps on the floor . When the trunk was quite empty , the killer lifted the body of the forger by the armpits and hefted it over to the trunk . It went in quite easily , the limp limbs buckling to conform with the contours of the interior of the trunk . Within a few hours rigor mortis would set in , jamming the corpse into its adopted position at the bottom of the case . The Jackal then started replacing the articles that had come out . Wigs , women 's underwear , toupees , and anything else that was small and soft were stuffed into the crevices between the limbs . On top went the several trays of make-up brushes and tubes of grease . Finally the jumble of remaining pots of cream , two negligees , some assorted sweaters and jeans , a dressing-gown , and several pairs of black fishnet stockings was placed on top of the body , completely covering it and filling the trunk to the brim . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but then the hasp went home and the padlock was shut . Throughout the operation the Englishman had handled the pots and jars by wrapping his hand in a piece of cloth from inside the case . Using his own handkerchief he now wiped off the lock and all outer surfaces of the trunk , pocketed the bundle of five-pound notes that/ 121THE DAY OF THE JACKAL Anatomy of a Plotstill lay on the table , wiped that too , and replaced it against the wall where it had stood when he came in . Finally he put out the light , took a seat on one of the occasional chairs against the wall , and settled down to wait until darkness fell . After a few minutes he took out his box of cigarettes , emptied the remaining ten into one of the side pockets of his jacket , and smoked one of them , using the empty box as the ash-tray and carefully preserving the used stub by putting it into the box when it was finished . He had few illusions that the disappearance of the forger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a man like that would probably have to go underground or travel out of town at periodic intervals . If any of his friends remarked on his sudden failure to appear at his normal haunts , they would probably put the fact down to that . After a while a search would start , first of all among the people connected with the forging or pornographic photo business . Some of these might know about the studio and visit it , but most would be deterred by the locked door . Anyone who did penetrate into the studio would have to ransack the place , force the lock on the trunk , and empty it before finding the body . A member of the underworld , doing this , would probably not reportthe matter to the police , he reasoned , thinking the forger had fallen foul of a gangland boss . No maniac customer interested in pornography alone would have bothered to hide the body so meticulouslyafter a killing in passion . But eventually the police would have to know . At that point a photograph of the forger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember his departure on the evening of August r in company with a tall blond man in a check suit and dark glasses . But it was an extremely long shot that anyone would for months to come examine the dead man 's deed box , even if he had registered it in his own name . He had exchanged no words with the barman , and the order for drinks he had given to the waiter in the same bar had been two weeks earlier . The waiter would have to have a phenomenal memory to recall the slight trace of foreign accent in the order for two beers . The police would launch a perfunctory search for a tall blond man , buteven if the enquiry got as far as Alexander Duggan , the Belgian police would still have to go a long way to find the Jackal . On balance , he felt he had at least a month , which was what he needed . The killing of the forger was as mechanical as stamping on a cockroach . The Jackal relaxed , finished a second cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep dusk had descended over the narrow street . He left the studio quietly , locking the outer door behind him . No one passed him as he went quietly down the street . Half a mile away he dropped the unidentifiable keys down a large drain set into the pavement and heard them splash into the water several feet down in the sewer beneath the street . He returned to his hotel in time for a late supper . The next day , Friday , he spent shopping in one of the working-class suburbs of Brussels . From a shop specialising in camping equipment he bought a pair of hiking boots , long woollen socks , denim trousers , check woollen shirt , and a haversack . Among his other purchases were several sheets of thin foam rubber , a string shopping bag , a ball of twine , a hunting knife , two thin paint brushes , a tin of pink paint and another of brown . He thought of buying a large Honeydew melon from an open fruit stall , but decided not to , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel he used his new driving licence , now matching his passport in the name of Alexander Duggan , to order a self-drive hire car for the following morning , and prevailed on the head receptionclerk to book him a single room with shower/bath for the weekendat one of the resorts along the sea coast . Despite the lack of accommodation available in August , the clerk managed to find him a room in a small hotel overlooking the picturesque fishing harbour of Zeebrugge , and wished him a pleasant weekend by the sea. 122 / / 123While the Jackal was doing his shopping in Brussels , Viktor Kowalski was wrestling with the intricacies of international telephone enquiries from Rome 's main post office . Not speaking Italian , he had sought the aid of the counter clerks , and eventually one of them had agreed that he spoke a little French . Laboriously Kowalski explained to him that he wished to telephone a man in Marseilles , France , but that he did not know the man 's telephone number . Yes , he knew the name and address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who asked Kowalski to write it down . This Kowalski did , but the Italian , unable to believe that any name could start " Grzyb . . . " spelt it out to the operator at the international exchange as " Grib ... " thinking that Kowalski 's written " z " had to be an " i . " No name Josef Gribowski existed in the Mar- seilles telephone directory , the operator informed the Italian at the other end of the phone . The clerk turned to Kowalski and explained that there was no such person . Purely by chance , because he was a conscientious man anxious to please a foreigner , the clerk spelt the name out to underline that he had got it right . " 11 n'existe pas , monsieur . Voyons : jay , air , eee  --  " " Non , jay , air , zed ... " cut in Kowalski . The clerk looked perplexed . " Excusez moi , monsieur . Jay , air , zed ? Jay , air , zed , ee-grec , bay ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Italian shrugged and presented himself to the switchboard operator once again . " Get me international enquiries , please . " Within ten minutes Kowalski had JoJo 's telephone number , and half an hour later he was through . At the end of the line the exlegionnaire'svoice was distorted by crackling , and he seemed hesitant to confirm the bad news in Kovacs 's letter . Yes , he was glad Kowalski had rung , he had been trying to trace him for three months . Unfortunately , yes , it was true about the illness of little Sylvie . She had been getting weaker and thinner , and when finally a doctor had diagnosed the illness , it had already been time to put her to bed . She was in the next bedroom at the flat from which JoJo was speaking . No it was not the same flat , they had taken a newer and larger one . What ? The address ? JoJo gave it slowly , while Kowalski , tongue between pursed lips , slowly wrote it down . " How long do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He got his meaning over to JoJo at the fourth time of trying . There was a long pause . " Allo ? Allo ? " he - shouted when there was no reply . JoJo 's voice came back . " It could be a week , maybe two or three , " said JoJo . Disbelievingly , Kowalski stared at the mouthpiece in his hand . Without a word he replaced it on the cradle and blundered out of the booth . After paying the cost of the call he collected the mail , snapped the steel case on his wrist tight shut , and walked back to the hotel . For the first time in many years his thoughts were in a turmoil , and there was no one to whom he could turn for orders how to solve the problem by violence . In his flat in Marseilles , the same one he had always lived in , JoJo also put down the receiver when he realized Kowalski had hung up . He turned to find the two men from the Action Service still where they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . One was 125THE DAY OF THE JACKAL Anatomy of a Plottrained on JoJo , the other on his wife , who sat ashen-faced in the corner of the sofa . " Bastards , " said JoJo with venom . " Shits . " " Is he coming ? " asked one of the men . " He did n't say . He just hung up on me , " said the Pole . The black , flat eyes of the Corsican stared back at him . " He must come . Those are the orders . " " Well , you heard me . I said what you wanted . He must have beenshocked . He just hung up . I could n't prevent him doing that . " " He had better come , for your sake , JoJo , " repeated the Corsican . " He will come , " said JoJo resignedly . " If he can , he will come . Forthe girl 's sake . " " Good . Then your part is done . " " Then get out of here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Corsican rose , the gun still in his hand . The other man remainedseated , looking at the woman . " We 'll be going , " said the Corsican , " but you two will come with us . We ca n't have you talking about the place or ringing Rome now , can we , JoJo ? " " Where are you taking us ? " " A little holiday . A nice pleasant hotel in the mountains . Plenty of sun and fresh air . Good for you , JoJo . " " For how long ? " asked the Pole dully . " For as long as it takes . " The Pole stared out of the window at the tangle of alleys and fish stalls that crouch behind the picture postcard frontage of the Old Port . " It is the height of the tourist season . The trains are full these days . In August we make more than all the winter . It will ruin us for several years . " The Corsican laughed as if the idea amused him . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JoJo . After all , it is for France , your adopted country . " The Pole spun round . " I do n't give a shit about politics . I do n't care who is in power , what party wants to make a fuck-up of everything . But I know people like you . I have been meeting them all my life . Youwould serve Hitler , your type . Or Mussolini , or the OAS if it suited you . Or anybody . Regimes may change , but bastards like you never change ... " He was shouting , limping towards the man with the gun whose snout had not quivered a millimetre in the hand that held it . " JoJo , " screamed the woman from the sofa . " I beg you  --  leave him alone ! " The Pole stopped and stared at his wife as if he had forgotten she was there . He looked round the room at the figures in it one by one . They all looked back at him , his wife imploring , the two Secret Service toughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no effect on the inevitable . The leader of the pair nodded towards the bedroom . " Get packed . You first , then the wife . " " What about Sylvie ? She will be home from school at four . There will be no one to meet her , " said the woman . The Corsican still stared at her husband . " She will be picked up by us on the way past the school . Arrangementshave been made . The headmistress has been told her granny is dying and the whole family has been summoned to her death bed . It 's all very discreet . Now move . " JoJo shrugged , gave a last glance at his wife , and went into the bedroom to pack , followed by the Corsican . His wife continued to twist her handkerchief between her hands . After a while she looked up at the other agent on the end of the sofa . He was younger than the Corsican , a Gascon . " What  --  what will they do to him ? " " Kowalski ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to him . That is all . " An hour later the family was in the back seat of a big Citroen , the two agents in the front , speeding towards a very private hotel high in the Vercors . The Jackal spent the weekend at the seaside . He bought a pair of swimming trunks and spent the Saturday sunning himself on the126 / / 127THE DAY OF THE JACKAL Anatomy of a Plotbeach at Zeebrugge , bathed several times in the North Sea , and wanderedround the little harbour town and along the mole where British soldiers and sailors had once fought and died in a welter of blood and bullets . Some of the walrus-moustached old men who sat along the mole and threw for sea bass might have remembered forty-six years before , had he asked them , but he did not . The English present that day were a few families scattered long the beach enjoying the sunshine and watching their children play in the surf . On Sunday morning he packed his bags and drove leisurely through the Flemish countryside , strolling through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the unmatchable steaks broiled over a timber fire served by the Siphon restaurant at Damm , and in the midafternoon turned the car back towards Brussels . Before turning in for the night , he asked for an early call with breakfast in bed and a packed lunch , explaining that he wished to drive into the Ardennes the following day and visit the grave of his elder brother who had died in the Battle of the Bulge between Bastogne and Malmedy . The desk clerk was most solicitous , promising that he would be called without fail for his pilgrimage . In Rome Viktor Kowalski spent a much less relaxed weekend . He turned up regularly on time for his periods of guard duty , either as the desk man on the landing on the eighth floor , or on the roof by night . He slept little in his periods off duty , mostly lying on his bed off the main passage of the eighth floor , smoking and drinking the rough red wine that was imported by the gallon flagon for the eight ex-legionnaires who made up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bite with the Algerian pinard that sloshes inside every legionnaire 's pannikin , he thought , but it was better than nothing . It habitually took Kowalski a long time to make up his mind on anything independently , but by Monday morning he had come to his decision . He would not be gone long , perhaps just a day , or maybe two days if the planes did not connect properly . In any event , it was something that had to be done . He would explain to the ' Patron " afterwards . Hewas sure the patron " would understand , even though he would be damned angry . It occurred to him to tell the colonel of the problem and ask for forty-eight hours ' leave , but he felt sure that the colonel , although a good commanding officer who also stuck by his men when they got into trouble , would forbid him to go . He would not understand about Sylvie , and Kowalski knew he could never explain . He could never explain anything in words . He sighed heavily as he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubled by the thought that for the first time in his life as a legionnaire , he was going to go A.W.O.L.The Jackal rose at the same time and made his meticulous preparations . He showered and shaved first , then ate the excellent breakfast placed on the tray by his bedside . Taking the case containing the rifle from the locked wardrobe , he carefully wrapped each component in several layers of foam rubber , securing the bundles with twine . These he stuffed into the bottom of his rucksack . On top went the paint tins and brushes , the denim trousers and check shirt , the socks and the boots . The string shopping bag went into one of the outer pockets of the rucksack , the box of bullets into the other . He dressed himself in one of his habitual striped shirts , a dove-grey lightweight suit as opposed to his usual check worsted ten-ounce , and a pair of light black leather loafers from Gucci . A black silk knitted tie completed the ensemble . He went down to his car , parked in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Returning to the foyer , he took delivery of his packed lunch , nodded a reply to the desk clerk 's wishes for a bon voyage , and by 9 was speeding out of Brussels along the old E 40 highway towards Namur . The flat countryside was already basking in a warm sunshine that gave a hint of a scorching day to come . His road-map told him it was ninety-four miles to Bastogne , and he added a few more to find a quiet place in the hills and forests to the south of the little town . He estimated he would do the hundred miles by noon easily and gunned the Simca Aronde into another long , flat straight across the Walloon plain . Before the sun had reached its zenith , he was through Namur and128 / / 129THE DAY OF THE JACKAL Anatomy of a PlotMarche , following the signposts that indicated Bastogne was approaching . Passing through the little town that had been torn to pieces by the guns of Hasso von Manteuffel 's King Tiger tanks in the winter of 1944 , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew thicker , the winding road more frequently darkened by great elms and beeches and less often sliced by a single beam of sunshine between the trees . Five miles beyond the town the Jackal found a narrow track runningoff into the forest . He turned the car down it and after another mile found a second trail leading away into the forest . He turned the car a few yards up this and hid it behind a clump of undergrowth . For a while he waited in the cool shade of the forest , smoking a cigarette and listening to the ticking of the engine block as it cooled , the whisper of wind through the upper branches , and the distant cooing of a pigeon . Slowly he climbed out , unlocked the trunk , and laid the rucksack on the hood . Piece by piece he changed his clothes , folding the impeccabledove-grey suit along the back seat of the Aronde and slipping on the denim slacks . It was warm enough to do without a jacket , and he changed the collared and tied shirt for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave way to the hiking boots and woollen socks into which he tucked the bottoms of the denims . One by one he unwrapped the component parts of the rifle , fitting it together piece by piece . The silencer he slipped into one trouser pocket , the telescopic sight into the other . He tipped twenty shells from the box into one breast pocket of his shirt , the single explosive shell , still in its tissue-paper wrapper into the other . When the rest of the rifle was assembled , he laid it on the hood of the car and went round to the trunk again and took from it the purchase he had made the previous evening from a market stall in Brussels before returning to the hotel , and which had lain in the trunk all night . It was the Honeydew melon . He locked the trunk , tipped the melon into the empty rucksack along with the paint , brushes and hunting knife , locked the car , and set off into the wood . It was just after noon . Within ten minutes he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where from one end one could get a clear vision for 150 yards . Placing the gun beside a tree , he paced out 150 paces , then sought a tree from which the place where he had left the gun was visible . He tipped the contents of the rucksack out onto the ground , prised the lids off both tins of paint , and set to work on the melon . The upper and lower parts of the fruit were painted quickly brown over the dark green skin . The centre section was colored pink . While both colours were still wet , he used his forefinger to draw crudely a pair of eyes , a nose , moustache , and mouth . Jabbing the knife into the top of the fruit to avoid smearing the paint by finger contact , the Jackal gingerly placed the melon insidethe string shopping bag . The big mesh and fine string of the bag in no way concealed either the outline of the melon or the designsketched upon it . Lastly he jabbed the knife hard into the trunk of the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handles of the shopping bag over the hilt . Against the green bark of the tree the pink and brown melon hung suspended like a grotesque autonomous human head . He stood back and surveyed his handiwork . At 150 yards it would serve its purpose . He closed the two tins of paint and hurled them far into the forest where they crashed through the undergrowth and disappeared . The brushes he jabbed into the ground bristles foremost and stamped on them until they too were lost to view . Taking the rucksack he went back to the rifle . The silencer went on easily , swivelling round the end of the barreluntil it was tight . The telescopic sight fitted snugly along the top of the barrel . He slipped back the bolt and inserted the first cartridge into the breech . Squinting down the sight , he scoured the far end of the clearing for his hanging target . When he found it , he was surprised to find how large and clear it looked . To all appearances , had it been the head of a living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards away . He could make out the130 / / 131THE DAY OF THE JACKAL Anatomy of a Plotcrisscross lines of the string of the shopping bag where it restrained the melon , his own finger smears denoting the main features of the face . He altered his stance slightly , leaned against a tree to steady his aim , and squinted again . The two crossed wires inside the telescopic sight did not appear to be quite centred , so he reached out with the right hand and twiddled the two adjusting screws until the cross in the sight appeared to be perfectly central . Satisfied , he took careful aim at the centre of the melon and fired . The recoil was less than he had expected , and the restrained " phut " of the silencer hardly loud enough to have carried across a quiet street . Carrying the gun under his arm , he walked back the length of the clearing and examined the melon . Near the upper right hand edge the bullet had scored its path across the skin of the fruit , snapping part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried itself in the tree . He walked back again and fired a second time , leaving the setting of the telescopic sight exactly where it had been before . The result was the same , with half an inch of difference . He tried four shots without moving the screws of the telescopic sight until he was convinced his aim was true , but the sight was firing high and slightly to the right . Then he adjusted the screws . This next shot was low and to the left . To make quite sure he again walked the length of the clearing and examined the hole made by the bullet . It had penetrated the lower left corner of the mouth on the dummy head . He tried three more shots with the sights still adjusted to this new position , and the bullets all went in the same area . Finally he moved the sights back by a whisker . The ninth shot went clean through the forehead , where he had aimed it . A third time he walked up to the target , and this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chalked the existing area touched by the bullets  --  the small cluster to the top and right , the second cluster round the left hand side of the mouth , and the neat hole through the centre of the forehead . From then on he plugged in succession each eye , the bridge of the nose , the upper lip and the chin . Swinging the target into a profileposition he used the last six shots through the temple , ear-hole , neck , cheek , jaw and cranium , only one of them being slightly off-target . Satisfied with the gun , he noted the positioning of the grub-screws that adjusted the telescopic sight and , taking a tube of balsa wood cement from his pocket , squirted the viscous liquid over the heads of both grub screws and the surface of the bakelite adjacent to them . Half an hour and two cigarettes later the cement was hard , and the sights were set for his eyesight with that particular weapon at 130 metres at spot-on accuracy . From his other breast pocket he took the explosive bullet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He took particularly careful aim at the centre of the melon and fired . As the last plume of blue smoke curled away from the end of the silencer , the Jackal laid the rifle against the tree and walked down the clearing towards the hanging shopping bag . It sagged , limp and almostempty , against the scarred trunk of the tree . The melon that had absorbed twenty lead slugs without coming to pieces had disintegrated . Parts of it had been forced through the mesh of the bag and lay scattered on the grass . Pips and juice dribbled down the bark . The remaining fragments of the fruit 's flesh lay broken in the lower end of the shopping bag , which hung like a weary scrotum from the hunting knife . He took the bag and tossed it into some nearby bushes . The target it had once contained was unrecognisable as anything but pulp . The knife he jerked out of the wood and put back in its sheath . He left the tree , retrieved his rifle , and strolled back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swaddling of foam rubber sheeting and replaced in the rucksack , along with his boots , socks , shirt , and slacks . He dressed again in his city clothes , locked the rucksack in the boot , and quietly ate his lunch sandwiches . When he had finished , he left the drive and drove back to the main road , turning left for Bastogne , Marche , Namur , and Brussels . He was back in the hotel shortly after six , and after taking his rucksack up to his room , descended to settle the charge for the hire car with the desk clerk . Before bathing for dinner , he spent an hour carefully132 / / 133THE DAY O F THE J A C K A L Anatomy of a Plotcleaning every part of the rifle and oiling the moving parts , stacked it away in its carrying case , and locked it into the wardrobe . Later that night the rucksack , twine , and several strips of foam rubber were dumped into a corporation refuse basket , and twenty-one used cartridgecases went spinning into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 , Viktor Kowalski was again at the main post office in Rome seeking the help of someone who spoke French . This time he wanted the clerk to telephone the Alitalia flight enquiries office and ask the times of planes during that week from Rome to Marseilles and back . He learned that he had missed the Monday flight , for it was leaving Fiumicino in an hour and he would not have time to catch it . The next direct flight was on Wednesday . No , there were no other airlines running a direct flight to Marseilles from Rome . There were indirect flights ; would the Signor be interested in that idea ? No ? The Wednesday flight ? Certainly , it left at ir:r5 a.m. , arriving at Marignane Airport , Marseilles , shortly after noon . The return flight would be the next day . One booking ? Single or return ? Certainly , and the name ? Kowalski gave the name on the papers he carried in his pocket . With passports abolished within the Common Market , the national identity card would be good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk at Fiumicino one hour before take-off on Wednesday . When the clerk put the phone down , Kowalski took the waiting letters , locked them into his etui , and left to walk back to the hotel . The following morning the Jackal had his last meeting with M. Goossens . He rang him over breakfast , and the armourer announced that he was pleased to say the work was finished . If Monsieur Duggan would like to call at ii a.m. ? And please to bring the necessary items for a final fitting . He arrived again with half an hour in hand , the small attache case inside an ordinary empty fibre suitcase that he had bought at a secondhandshop earlier in the morning . For thirty minutes he surveyed the street in which the armourer lived before finally walking quietly to thefront door . When M. Goossens let him in , he went on into the office without hesitating . Goossens joined him after locking the front door , and closed the office door behind him . " No more problems ? " asked the Englishman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " From behind his desk the Belgian produced several rolls of hessian sacking and laid them on the desk . As he undid them , he laid side by side a series of thin steel tubes , so polished they looked like aluminum . When the last one was laid on the desk he held out his hand for the attache case containing the component parts of the rifle . The Jackal gave it to him . One by one , the armourer started to slide the parts of the rifle into the tubes . Each one fitted perfectly . " How was the target practice ? " he enquired as he worked . " Very satisfactory . " Goossens noticed as he handled the telescopic sight that the adjustingscrews had been fixed into place with a blob of balsa wood cement . " I am sorry the calibrating screws should have been so small , " he said , " It is better to work off precise markings , but again it was the size of the original screw heads that got in the way . So I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never have fitted into its tube . " He slipped the telescope into the steel tube designed for it , and like the other components it fitted exactly . When the last of the five components of the rifle had disappeared from view , he held up the tiny needle of steel that was the trigger , and the five remaining explosive bullets . " These , you see , I have had to accommodate elsewhere , " he explained . He took the black leather padded butt of the rifle and showed his customer how the leather had been slit with a razor . He pushed the trigger into the stuffing inside and closed the slit with a strip of black insulating tape . It looked quite natural . From the desk drawer he took a lump of circular black rubber about one and a half inches in diameter and two inches long . From the centre of one circular face a steel stud protruded upwards , threaded like a screw . " This fits onto the end of the last of the tubes , " he explained. 134 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ K A L Anatomy of a PlotRound the steel stud were five holes drilled downwards into the rubber . Into each one he carefully fitted a bullet , until only the brass percussion caps showed to view . " When the rubber is fitted , the bullets become quite invisible , and the rubber gives a touch of verisimilitude , " he explained . The Englishmanremained silent . " What do you think ? " asked the Belgian with a touch of anxiety . Without a word the Englishman took the tubes and examined them one by one . He rattled them , but no sound came from inside , for the interiors were lined with two layers of baize to absorb both shock and noise . The longest of the tubes was twenty inches ; it accommodated the barrel and breech of the gun . The others were about a foot each , and contained the two struts , upper and lower , of the stock , the silencer , and the telescope . The butt , with the trigger inside its padding , was separate , as was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let alone an assassin 's rifle , it had vanished . " Perfect , " said the Jackal , nodding quietly . " Absolutely what I wanted . " The Belgian was pleased . Although an expert in his trade , he enjoyed praise as much as the next man , and he was aware that in his field the customer in front of him was also in the top bracket . The Jackal took the steel tubes , with the parts of the gun inside them , and wrapped each one carefully in the sacking , placing each piece into the fibre suitcase . When the five tubes , butt , and rubber knob were wrapped and packed , he closed the fibre suitcase and handed the attache case with its fitted compartments back to the armourer . " I shall not be needing that any more . The gun will stay where it is until I have occasion to use it . " He took the remaining two hundred pounds he owed the Belgian from his inner pocket and put it on the table . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belgian pocketed the money . " Yes , monsieur , unless you have anything else in which I may be of service . " " Only one , " replied the Englishman . " You will please remember my little homily to you a fortnight ago on the wisdom of silence . " " I have not forgotten , monsieur , " replied the Belgian quietly . He was frightened again . Would this soft-spoken killer try to silence him now , to ensure his silence ? Surely not . The enquiries into such a killing would expose to the police the visits of the tall Englishman to this house long before he ever had a chance to use the gun he now carried in a suitcase . The Englishman seemed to be reading his thoughts . He smiled briefly . " You do not need to worry . I do not intend to harm you . Besides , I imagine a man of your intelligence has taken certain precautions against being killed by one of his customers . A telephone call expected within an hour perhaps ? A friend who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not come through ? A letter deposited with a lawyer , to be opened in the event of your death ? For me , killing you would create more problems than it would solve . " M. Goossens was startled . He had indeed a letter permanently deposited with a lawyer , to be opened in the event of his death . It instructed the police to search under a certain stone in the back garden . Beneath the stone was a box containing a list of those expected to call at the house each day . It was replaced each day . For this day , the note described the only customer expected to call , a tall Englishmanof well-to-do appearance who called himself Duggan . It was just a form of insurance . The Englishman watched him calmly . " I thought so , " he said . " You are safe enough . But I shall kill you , without fail , if you ever mention my visits here or my purchase from you to anyone , anyone at all . So far as you are concerned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That is perfectly clear , monsieur . It is the normal working arrangement with all my customers . I may say , I expect similar discretionfrom them . That is why the serial number of the gun you carry has been scorched from the barrel with acid . I too must protect myself . " The Englishman smiled again . " Then we understand each other . Good day , Monsieur Goossens . " A minute later the door closed behind him , and the Belgian who knew so much about guns and gunmen but so little about the Jackal136 / / 137THE DAY OF THE JACKALbreathed a sigh of relief and withdrew to his office to count the money . The Jackal did not wish to be seen by the staff of his hotel carrying a cheap fibre suitcase so although he was late for lunch he took a taxi straight to the mainline station and deposited the case in the leftluggageoffice , tucking the ticket into the inner compartment of his slim lizard-skin wallet . He lunched at the Cygne well and expensively to celebrate the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and walked back to the Amigo to pack and pay his bill . When he left , it was exactly as he had come , in a finely cut check suit , wraparound dark glasses , and with two Vuitton suitcases following him in the hands of the porter down to the waiting taxi . He was also t600 pounds poorer , but his rifle reposed safely inside an unobtrusive suitcase in the luggage office of the station and three finely forged cards were tucked into an inside pocket of his suit . The plane left Brussels for London shortly after 4 , and although there was a perfunctory search of one of his bags at London Airport , there was nothing to be found , and by 7 he was showering in his own flat before dining out in the West End . R eightUnfortunately for Kowalski , there were no telephone calls to make at the post office on Wednesday morning ; had there been he would have missed his plane . And the mail was waiting in the pigeonhole for M. Poitiers . He collected the five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the chain , and set off hurriedly for the hotel . By half past nine he had been relieved of both by Colonel Rodin , and was free to go back to his room for sleep . His next turn of duty was on the roof , starting at 7 that evening . He paused in his room only to collect his Colt .45 ( Rodin would never allow him to carry it on the street ) and tucked it into his shoulder holster . If he had worn a well-fitting jacket the bulge of the gun and holster would have been evident at a hundred yards , but his suits were as ill-fitting as a thoroughly bad tailor could make them , and despite his bulk they hung on him like sacks . He took the roll of sticking plaster and the beret that he had bought the day before and stuffed them into his jacket , pocketed the roll of lire notes and French francs that represented his past six months savings , and closed the door behind him . At the desk of the landing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone call made , " said Kowalski , jerking his thumb upwards in the direction of the ninth floor above . The guard138 / /
