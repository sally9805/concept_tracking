txt The beautifully landscaped , tree-lined campus of Spelman College here is as it appears to be  --  calm , classy and comfortable . And , like its New Englandstyle architecture plunked down in the Deep South , it also may be a bit unsure of its position . One of the two remaining black women 's colleges in the U.S. ( the other is Bennett College in Greensboro , N.C. ) , Spelman is facing an identity crisis . Before the battle for integration largely succeeded , the 94-year-old liberal-arts college educated the daughters of the nation 's best black families . It contributed significantly to black education and culture . Even during the radical 1960s , Spelman survived its posh image  --  it 's often called the Vassar of the South  --  and maintained its prominence because it was black during a period when black was beautiful . But now , Spelman has become a victim of its own successful fight for social change . Many of its potential students have been lured away to prestigious white colleges that once would have accepted few or none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's liberation and the desire by some of its students to take such previously all-male subjects as engineering . With racial problems no longer viewed in terms of a crisis , it has lost its position as a rallying point . And it has n't any minority programs to help catapult blacks into key jobs  --  being black is n't special on an allblack campus , and thus Spelman women do n't receive the special attention that some blacks on white campuses get from corporate recruiters . So Spelman is seeking to regain its leadership via a $17 million fund-raising campaign . If the drive succeeds , it may put Spelman back on the map ( an important goal in itself  --  even the college 's recruiting brochure concedes that " unless you 're black and a woman , you may never have heard of Spelman " ) . If the drive fails , the college may be doomed , at best , to comfortable obscurity . Why It Wants Money The stakes are so high because the 1,100-student college believes it needs the money to compete with white schools . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physics and other subjects . It wants money for new physical facilities , faculty salaries and scholarships . And it hopes the campaign will attract the attention of both foundations and corporate recruiters . But despite Spelman 's sudden concern with fund raising and despite an anticipated $100,000 deficit for the school year just ending , the college never has faced a financial crisis . For Spelman has had the good fortune to be closely linked with the Rockefeller fortune . Just one year after Spelman was founded as the first school for black women , John D. Rockefeller Sr. , at a fund-raising meeting in Cleveland , was said f.o have emptied his pockets and made his first pledge . In 1884 , the school was named Spelman in honor of his wife 's mother , Mrs. Harvey Spelman . From then on , the links multiplied . The school 's 92-year-old administration building is named Rockefeller Hall . The fine-arts building , a dormitory and the lovely 1,200-seat chapel all are named for various Rockefellers . And various Rockefellers lead the current fund-raising campaign , with Mrs. Laurence S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the chairman . is American Telephone &; Telegraph President Robert D. Lilley . " We were looking for someone in business to head the campaign , " says Albert E. Manley , Spelman 's 67-year-old president . Off to Fast Start The Rockefeller-AT &T; ties have helped Spelman 's campaign : The Rockefeller Brothers Fund contributed $1 million , AT &T; and its affiliates gave about $285,000 , and subbtantial donations flowed in from International Business Machines , Chase Manhattan Bank and several foundations . The first $8 million was raised easily . - While it is unusual for a black women 's college to attract such big-league corporate backing , the school 's history is a bit unusual , too . Spelman was founded in 1881 by two Massachusetts women who had gone South to study living conditions among freed men . They decided to set up a Baptist seminary to provide religious and educational opportunities for women just out Of slavery . The seminary opened in the basement of AtlantaN Friendship Baptist Church with $100 and 11 students . By 1884 , the seminary had a printing office and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a school fur blacks . In 1856 , it started a nurses ' training program . By IMO , it awarded its first college degrees . Four years later it sent its first three graduates to medical school . In 1924 , it became a teachers ' college , and for many years one of its principal contributions to society was to supply a steady stream of teachers to black schools . During the years when segregation was in full sway , Spelman also made another important contribution to the black community . Along with Morehouse College , the nearby school for black men , Spelman served as a social and cultural center . The two schools offered many blacks their only exposure to the fine arts , and they were meeting grounds for black notables . W. E. B. DuBois , the late black natknalist , once lived on Spelman 's 22-acre campus . Yet , despite the many black leaders linked with Spelman , its administration and faculty long remained largely white . The New Image Only now , under its first black administration , is Spelman presenting itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white-run one with black students . For the first time , the faculty is predominantly black . The drama department now presents Afro-American and African plays instead of Ibsen and Shakespeare . The library , which has an excellent collection of black authors , is getting more emphasis . Even the school 's exchange program , which once brought white students from institutions like Smith and Wellesley , has changed ; it now brings to Spelman black women from Waite colleges . " We 've got to bring black women home , " one Spelman woman says . But even though many Spelman students say they came to the school ' to get " relief from integi aced education " or to share the " black female experience , " most of them recognize that Spelman certainly does n't offer a craNh course in blackness . In fact , the school did n't succumb to the educational trend toward Afro-American studies and does n't offer any degrees in black studies . During the height of the black-is-beautiful movement , of course , Spelman students felt forced to reaffirm their blackness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Power meetings , Spelman 's black period waned . Groups like the Sisters of Blackness , once a radical political group , became community-service organizations . This decline of radicalism -- a phenomenon widely noted on white campuses as well ? has produced a crop of Spelman students more likely to talk about Morehouse men and marriage than about politics . The student body , which probably feels less oppressed and less radical than almost any in Spelman history , is n't part of any particular political or social struggle . Some students , in fact , are more inclined to struggle over the 60-year issue of whether Spelman should have perorates on campus . The return to parochial problems , Spelman 's critics say , really represents a return to what has been Spelman 's problem all along . They charge that the school has n't sought to uplift the whole black population but merely to serve as a finishing school for a few black elite . An Additional Insult This charge  --  probably the greatest obstacle in its current campaign for recognition  --  sprang from the fact that so many Spelman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black society . Moreover , there was an additional insult to many blacks : Spelman women frequently have very light skin and straight hair . This physical phenomenon of the early black social structure  --  which was based on white appearance , ideals and livelihood  --  seemed to indicate that light skin facilitated sticcess , and its frequent presence at Spelman was embarrassing during the black-is-beautiful days and still stirs one of the college 's moat heated intraracial conflicts . The finishing-school image also was implanted by long years of strict social codes . For example , the students were traditionally pictured in skirts and blouses , and only in 1969 did they win the right to wear pants on campus . The student curfew was pushed back to 2 a.m. only reluctantly , and compulsory chapel was abolished ? only recently : " Spelman used to have the image of a black elitist finishing school , " Sadie Allen , Dean of Women and an alumna , concedes . " But Spelman 's purpose has always been to train women for jobs , not for society , " she argues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and still believesoin traditional education that trains its students for careers ? nontraditional for women  --  in business , medicine , law and the social sciences . in this way Spelman resembles the best white women 's colleges . Over half its student body goes on to graduate school . Basle Subjects Stressed In trying to move with the times , Spelman is trying to leave behind its finishingschool reputation by putting even more emphasis on its traditional , basic-subject type of curriculum . Even courses like home economics have taken new directions and new names . A new option offers dual degrees in traditional social sciences plus engineering or physics . And the school is a part of a six-institution complex called the Atlanta University Center . Another phase of Spelman 's quest for a new image is its effort to diversify its student body , which now is drawn from 87 states and numerous foreign countries . Its fundraising materials and its recruiting mailings now show black women of all types and , especially , of all shades . The school also takes pains to stress that from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It says that only about 20% of its students can be considered middle class . And although the tuition for a 12- to 18-hour semester is only $866 , well over half the students need financial aid . But despite the drive to modernise its image and the- fund-raising campaign to make many of the changes financially possible , it seems unlikely that Spelman ever will regain the prominence it enjoyed during its first 70 years . And the basic split remains . Many students think that the school is guilty of complacency . But many observers , particularly alumnae , think that the school is trying too hard to become a center for black Intelligentsia again . " It 's sacrificing Its tradition , " one 47-year-old complains .
