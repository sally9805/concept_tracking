SMOKE-FILLED ROOMS <P> Being in a room with people who are smoking can be hazardous to your health . Fact or fancy ? Fact , says Cardiologist Wilbert Aronow of the University of California College of Medicine at Irvine . In a study at the Long Beach Veterans Administration Hospital , Aronow tested the effects of passive smoking ( breathing smoke-contaminated air ) on ten men with severe coronary-artery disease . All of them had angina pectoris , a condition marked by chest pain and triggered by not enough oxygen reaching the heart . Each man sat in an 11-ft. by 12-ft. room with three people who each smoked five cigarettes over a period of two hours . Ordinarily , the men could pedal exercise about four minutes before experiencing chest pains . After sitting in a smoke-filled room , they were forced to stop after only 2 to 3 min. , and their heart rates and blood pressures rose as they inhaled the nicotine-laden air . Concludes Aronow : " Passive smoking aggravates angina pectoris . " <P> <P> SKATEBOARD INJURIES <P> When skateboard fever surfaced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skyrocket . The estimated number of skateboard injuries treated in emergency rooms , a measly 3,682 in 1973 , rose in 1977 to a whopping 140,070 , about a third of them fractures . The Consumer Product Safety Commission 's National Injury Information Clearinghouse once ranked skateboards ( along with scooters and skates ) 42nd on the list of hazards ; now the group is No. 7 . Very few injuries are due to product defects . Says Clearinghouse Director Nancy Johnston : " We found that a lot of injuries occur in the first week of use or with borrowed skateboards . They 're due to the skateboarder not having enough experience , balance or judgment . " <P> Though injuries in the first six months of 1978 were down to 45,698 from 70,874 for the same period last year , Johnston says that " by the end of the year , the number could still catch up .
