To most people , furnishing a new house or apartment is an expensive , sometimes traumatic experience-where to put the chairs , how to arrange the sofas in the conversation area , and what decorating style to choose . A growing number of architect-designers may have found the solution to these troublesome questions : no furniture at all . Man 's earliest shelter was a cave with a rock to sit on , and perhaps it gave him more peace of mind than a cluttered room in a contemporary home . <P> " Chairs , for example , create rigid environments , " explains Thomas Luckey , 31 , a New Haven environmental architect . " Because chairs are in fixed locations , they limit your options as to where to sit . " In most rooms that Luckey and his colleagues design , conventional furniture is replaced by lumps , bumps and other more or less organized protrusions that serve as chairs , couches , tables and shelves . " The basic formula , " says Charles Moore , former dean of Yale 's School of Architecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to design an environment that is relatively cheap , comfortable and useful . " After that , he says , " almost anything goes . " Some of the more remarkable examples : <P> MULTILEVEL PLATFORMS . Architect Michael Black was called in by Harold Slavkin , a Los Angeles molecular biologist , to plan a vacation house . He disposed of all furniture , building a complex of multilevel platforms covered with carpeting . Now guests sit , lie or sprawl , and flop from one tier to another as conversations catch their interest . " In a 10-ft. by 12-ft. area , " says Slavkin 's wife Kay , " we 've had as many as twelve people in practically as many postures . " Black also revamped the Slavkins ' staid , traditional Los Angeles house . " The problem , " he says , " was a cold , formal living room and warm , informal people . " Once again , he used platforms to replace furniture . " The first time people see it , " says Kay Slavkin , " they just stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raymond Kappe 's California home carries the tiered effect even further , with floors of one room becoming sofas ( also tables , chairs and beds ) for another . " You can sit on the edge of the drawing room and dangle your feet into the studio , " says Kappe . " There are so many places for people to sit or sprawl that we can entertain a hundred and still retain intimacy . " <P> MOVABLE COLUMN . New Haven Architect Luckey has designed an 8-ft. - long , 6-ft. - diameter column that can be used in various ways . In a horizontal position , it serves as a bed or a couch ; when it is lifted to a vertical position , the interior can be used as a dressing space , storage area or simply as a place to read in peace . <P> URETHANE BLOCKS . St. Louis Architect Terrence Cashen has furnished his living room with two dozen 1-ft. by 2-ft. urethane blocks , lit it with two strings of naked light bulbs , and mirrored two opposite walls to reflect blocks and bulbs receding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The unmirrored walls are white , carpet and cubes charcoal gray . " The lack of color , " says Cashen , " makes people more important because they add color . "
