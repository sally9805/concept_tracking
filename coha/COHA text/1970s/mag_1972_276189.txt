ITT Lobbyist Dita Beard agreed last week to talk about her past with TIME Correspondent Ted Hall . It was only days before she was to face a grilling by U.S. Senators investigating Columnist Jack Anderson 's charges that she had written a memo linking the Nixon Administration 's settlement of an antitrust case against ITT with a company contribution to the Republican National Convention ( see THE PRESS ) . The rumbustious Mrs. Beard , 53 , refused to discuss her role in the ITT controversy , but was not at all shy about revealing intimate , if sometimes confused details of her earlier days . Hall 's report : <P> <P> DRESSED in a navy blue nightgown with white piping at the neckline , Dita Beard chain-smoked cigarettes in Room 269 of Denver 's 178-bed Rocky Mountain Osteopathic Hospital behind a sign that said NO SMOKING PLEASE , OXYGEN IN USE . Under treatment for a heart ailment , Dita was well protected against unwanted visitors by tight screening . Western Union called with a telegram that had to be read to her personally . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO BUY DRINKS . Dita 's laugh rumbled from her diaphragm . " Must be my old drinking buddies from the club , " she explained . <P> The way Dita tells it , her life has had its grim moments , but mostly it was fun . Her job at ITT " got better and better-it was beautiful until those sons of bitches pulled this one on me . " She was apparently referring to Columnist Anderson and his legman Brit Hume . " I started raising hell when I was born , and I ai n't quit yet , " she said . Her father Robert Davis was serving in Germany as an Army colonel when she was born at Fort Riley , Kans. , in 1918 . Her parents at one point had three birth certificates prepared with different names : Alsace Lorraine , Roberta and Adele Fournier . She does not know how she wound up with the name Dita . The family moved to Fort Monmouth , N.J. , where , she claims , her father was so important in helping build up the Signal Corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goddam place , " she says . " But when it got big , some son of a bitch took Dad 's picture down . " <P> Mann Act . Dita grew up as an Army brat , moving from base to base . She adored her father , who treated her like a boy , made her learn to ride almost as soon as she could walk . " Every morning at 5:30 , the goddam horses were at the back door , " she recalls of a stay in the Panama Canal Zone . She was on a raft there once , swimming with her father , when a " goddam crocodile was skulking under the raft . " He ordered her to swim for shore anyway . <P> Dita claims that she moved too often to finish high school . Her mother , an amateur concert singer who loved to travel ( " She did n't care much for me " ) , would take her out of school on trips whenever Army transportation looked tempting . Her father bought a 300-acre spread , Rising Wolf Ranch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child . " Dad thought nothing of giving me a gun and a fishing rod and telling me to go off for a couple of weeks . I learned to be very independent . " He retired from the Army in grand style in 1930 , she claims . " He hit his commanding general over the head with a riding crop at the officer 's club-we never did know which was drunker. "
