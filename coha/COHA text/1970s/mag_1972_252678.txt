To many Americans over 40 , a simple ceremony in Tokyo this week will perhaps serve as a strange and vaguely reassuring reminder of how shallow are the tracks of former wars . During 82 savage and bloody spring days in 1945 , 12,300 American servicemen died in the closing months of the Pacific war for the control of Okinawa , a 60-mile-long island in the East China Sea . Early this week , in the gardens of the Imperial Palace , Vice President Spiro Agnew is to read a presidential proclamation , signed by Richard Nixon , that will end the U.S. military occupation of Okinawa and 140 other islands of the Ryukyu chain . For both nations this reversion to Japanese control will resolve what Agnew describes as " the last major issue of the war . " <P> On Okinawa ( pop . 1,000,000 ) , worshipers at a memorial service in front of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Naha , the island capital , will give thanks to the spirits of the dead for the return of sovereignty to the motherland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing in the streets or displays of fireworks that accompanied the first reports in late 1969 that the U.S. was getting ready to return political control to Tokyo . Even though most Okinawans welcome the change , they have had time enough for uneasy second thoughts about their island 's future . " After all , " Okinawan Banker Hiroshi Senaga told TIME Correspondent Frank Iwama , " the younger generation was brought up under U.S. administration , and the older generation knows only the discriminatory policies of Tokyo that made prewar Okinawa a second-class prefecture of Japan . " <P> Raising Income . The changeover will affect almost every aspect of island life . Pay telephones are being fitted to take ten-yen coins instead of nickels ; price tags and taximeters are being adjusted . Road signs will soon be changed from miles to kilometers , and eventually drivers will have to learn to use the left-hand side of the street . In what the Bank of Japan describes as the biggest shipment of money in history , a cargo of 54 billion yen ( about $180 million ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparation for a massive conversion of currency . The islanders are being permitted to exchange most of their U.S. money at the pre-revaluation rate of 360 yen to the dollar ( v. 302 at the current rate ) . <P> One major problem for the Japanese is how to strengthen Okinawa 's economy , which is still heavily dependent on U.S. military spending . To improve the island 's unfavorable trade balance ( $102 million in exports last year , v. $424 million in imports ) , the government has urged Japanese firms to open Okinawan branches . Most U.S. firms now on the island expect to remain . As an additional boost , the government plans to hold a huge International Ocean Exposition in 1975 and expects to spend about $1 billion on roads , buildings and other facilities that will continue to help the economy when the exposition is over .
