QB VII by Leon Uris. 504 pages . Doubleday . $7.95 . <P> The Jews who have survived pogroms and genocide will doubtless weather this vulgar affront as well . Still , individual Jews who find themselves stuck in Leon Uris ' paper detention camp must surely regard QB Vll as a rather gratuitous endurance test . <P> Based on a libel suit that the author actually faced in England over a sentence in his third novel , Exodus , the book pits a Gentile Polish doctor , Adam Kelno , against a famous American Jewish novelist , Abe Cady . During World War II Dr. Kelno was forced to practice medicine in the infamous Jadwiga concentration camp . He sues Cady for libel because of a sentence that strayed into Cady 's blockbuster novel , The Holocaust , which casually charges Kelno with performing " 15,000 or more experimental operations without use of anesthesia . " The surgery involved sterilization and mutilation of sexual organs . After setting up these pasteboard people , Uris embarks on a lengthy trial scene in which the grizzly camp testimony unfolds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the genre . The prose is an illiterate shorthand : " Lou was a tall , thin man with a sleepy face whose dominating feature was seventy Sy Devore suits . " The plot is interstitched with editorials , sermons and lessons in writing . On the latter subject one can hardly deny Uris his soapbox . He has always been a crude novelist . Yet Exodus is the sixth biggest bestselling novel of the century , * and QB VII , after wintering comfortably atop all the charts , is now second only to Exodus in the author 's hardback sales . <P> Sadomasochism . Still Uris ' fictional caveats-rung in through Abe 's conversations with his British publisher - seem absurdly at odds with his own wretched writing performance this time out . According to Uris , what most writers apparently forget is basic storytelling -a skill he himself once practiced but has neglected in this heavily predictable tale . Then there is that literary creation Author Abe himself , a mensh who makes Hemingway seem as mousy as Mann . Writing is heavy going for Abe . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is often " unable to lace his shoes " at the end of a day 's work . <P> Abe emerges , finally , as the shining avenger of Jewish wrongs , despite the fact that he is technically guilty of libel since the number of Kelno 's crimes did not approach 15,000 and Abe , who can not recall the doctor at all when charged , does not even know how that pesky sentence got into his book in the first place . <P> The result of Abe 's fecklessness is a roundup of Kelno 's victims , who must come to London to relive their tortures in court . Understandably , Abe does not even want to see them , but his son reassures him . " The minute you meet them , you 'll forget about their mutilation , " he cries . Abe does pull himself together , so much so that each victim goes away with an autographed copy of his complete works . In the meantime , their testimony has accounted for pages and pages of excruciatingly detailed descriptions of sexual organs and agony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in slapdash fiction it is only sadomasochism . Which is a popular theme in popular novels these days . <P> Martha Duffy
