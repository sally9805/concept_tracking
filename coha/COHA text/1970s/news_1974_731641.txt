txt Eight men stood in the early morning sunshine Tuesday waiting for the union hall to open . The talk was about the shutdown at the Chrysler auto plant , unemployment hecks , and unpaid bills . A few of the men thought the plant would be idle for only a short time . But others had the sinking , desperate feeling that the assembly line would be closed forever . Then came the news  --  good and bad . About 1,600 workers on the first shift would be called back to work Jan. 6 . But another 1,600 on the second shift were out " indefinitely . " " I do n't know when they are to return , " said a Chrysler spokesman . " We 're just calling it an indefinite layoff and that 's it . " THE LAST Valiants and Darts were driven off the assembly line Nov. 1 . Now they are parked alongside the hundreds of Jther shiny new compacts in the plant 's storage lot . Then the company announced a two-week temporary layoff . But on Nov. 8 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men were told to turn in their plant identification cards . Their shift was eliminated . Forest , 58 , a relief spray painter on the production line , has 15 years ' seniority . Back in the early ' 60s , he was laid off for three years . This time , it will be only two months . Thomas Mize Jr. , 27 , a repairman with 91/2 years ' seniority , said he worked " 12 and 14 hours a day , 7 days a week " during the summer of 1973 . But because he was on the second shift , he expects to be without a job for some time , " THE FIRST THING I 'd do , " told Mize , " is I 'd look for another job . And then when they call you back  --  which they have to do under union rules  --  you come back . " No matter how long it takes , you come back . Your seniority stays with you and you do n't want to lose it . That 's money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mize answered . " I applied at a motel for a part-time job as a desk clerk . Then , I went to the gas stations . But they say they might be cutting back . " Nobody wants to hire a Chrysler employe because they know they 'll go back when the plant starts up . What am I going to do in the meantime ? " THE ANSWER sounds relatively simple . The state pays each man $80 a week unemployment compensation from the time he Is laid off until he is rehired or finds another job . The checks come in regular as clockwork for 26 weeks and can be extended for another 13 weeks . In addition , under the United Auto Workers Union contract , each production line worker receives $50 to $60 Supplemental Unemployment Benefits S.U.B. from Chrysler . These payments run for one year or until the fund is exhausted ? whichever comes first . Thus , during a layoff , each worker gets 95 per cent of his take-home pay less $7.50 , the estimated weekly cost of transportation and lunches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot to ' many men , even tho all their other substantial benefits such as hospitalization and medical and dental insurance remain in affect . Before news of the plant 's reopening was announced , a few of the men in the union hall  --  those who thought the shutdown was temporary ? were treating the layoff as an unexpected vacation . One said he planned to go hunting in Virginia . Another ' said that as long as the unemployment checks continued to roll in , he did n't care if he ever worked again . " YOU KNOW , they 're treating this like a big joke , " said Tom Lambeck , 30 , who was laid off last July after 2% years and has not found another job . " After all , we are unskilled labor and where can we get job security ? I hear the utilities are going to cut back and when that happens , things are really bad . " EARNS $5.86 an hour including cost-of-living and takes home about $170 a week . During the layoff , he figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $125 mortgage payment due last week , a $68 car payment is due later this month , and I just paid a - $60 utility bill , " said . " I 'm carrying two personal loans and they wo n't let me borrow any more on my Master Charge . I 've already written checks on my savings and that 's almost gone . called up all my creditors and they agreed to give me time . You know it takes two weeks to get the first state unemployment check and four weeks for the first S.U.B . payment . " Before Mize was laid off , his wife was ' looking for a job . However , she has not been feeling well and last week , the doctor said she may have to go to the hopsital . HE HAS $600 in a savings account but he , too , has car and mortgage payments coming due . He talked of selling his house , but added : " Where would I go ? " Mize has given up cigarets and taken to chewing tobacco . But his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , he says . And later this week , he will find out if he is eligible for food stamps . Last year , the Chrysler assembly plant here had about 5,200 workers and the adjacent auto parts plant employed more than 300 . During the height of the energy crisis , the company eliminated the third shift on the assembly line and started cutting back foremen and whiteolLar workers . The parts plant , so far , has not been affected , probably because auto dealers report their customers are more concerned than ever about keeping their cars in good condition . The foremen and whitecollar workers received severance pay but no S.U.B . pay .
