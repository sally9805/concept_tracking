txt While President Carter 's decision to scrap the B-1 bomber has far-reaching political implications for the U.S. defense posture and U.S.-Soviet arms negotiations , the immediate human impact will be felt in this town and other places like Palmdale . The national economy will not be seriously affected by the cancellation , economists contacted by this newspaper say . But a so-called " ripple effect " is expected to hurt employees and suppliers in the aerospace industry here and elsewhere in southern California , and in other states where parts of the plane are manufactured . Palmdale ( population 10,600 ) is 70 miles northeast of Los Angeles City Hall on the edge of the stark and arid Mojave Desert . Half the work force here depends on federally funded aerospace programs like Rockwell International 's $24 billion contract to build 244 B-1 bombers . For California , the scrapping of the B-1 means an immediate loss of 8,000 jobs by Aug. 1 . Here in Palmdale , the belt-tightening has begun . Some 4,000 new jobs were lost in the presidential veto . With 1,600 townspeople @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aerospace industry already nudging citywide unemployment above 7 percent ( down from 9 percent last December ) , the B-1 was considered by many to be the key to Palmdale 's future prosperity . One of them is George Knapp , a Rockwell worker helping to assemble the fourth B-1 prototype currently under production in the company hangar at the edge of town . " Palmdale ca n't survive without the B-1 " , he said . " This place is going to turn into a dust bowl faster than you can say ' Tomahawk cruise missile . ' " From  --  a e 1 Aerospace workers wait The ' Tomahawk ' he mentioned is a stubby version of the cruise missile . President Carter says the cruise , launched from existing B-52s , could do the same job as the supersonic B-1 bomber at a fraction of the cost . The B-1 contract here called for four prototype planes . Three had been built and tested ? for 118 hours , 17 minutes ? before Mr. Carter announced his decision . The fourth was 40 percent complete . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is awaiting word as to his future at Rockwell ? and as a resident of Palmdale . Another Rockwell worker , James Lewis , said : " It is n't like this kind of thing has n't happened before . It 's just that a kick in the wallet never feels good . . . . Now , it looks like I 'll have to move where the work is . If I ca n't hold on here , my family and I say , ' good-byePalmdale . ' And so do a lot of others . " AS a major aircraft-manufacturing testing center , Palmdale has a long history of rolling with the aerospace punches . Lockheed of California is here . Other aerospace companies with interests in this area include Northrop , McDonnell Douglas , and Boeing . " Palmdale has survived the recession , " said Mayor Robert St. Clair , referring to the 1967-72 period , when the California aerospace employment plummeted from 616,000 to less than 440,000 . " Palmdale , " continued Mayor St. Clair , " has survived the Lockheed 1011 TriStar . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the continued production of the space shuttle . Last week , the shuttle made its most recent test flight , bolted to the back of a Boeing 747.
