txt Jim Hickman of the Cubs singled in the bottom of the 12th to drive in Pete Rose of the Reds in the All-Star game last night as the National League beat the American , 5 to 4 , in Cincinnati . The Nationals scored three runs in the bottom of the ninth to tie the game , 4 to 4 , and send it into extra innings . They came on a solo homer by Dick Dietz of the Giants , a single by Willie McCovey of the Giants , and a sacrifice fly by Roberto Clemente of the Pirates . The end came swiftly in the 12th on consecutive two-out singles by Rose and Bill Grabarkewitz of the Dodgers to set it up for Hickman .
