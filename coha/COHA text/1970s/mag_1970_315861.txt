Every presidency develops its own trappings of status . Under Richard Nixon , the favored few who travel on Air Force One cherish their blue , Air Force special issue flight jackets emblazoned with the presidential seal and personal silver-and-black name tags . All the President 's top aides-Henry Kissinger , John Ehrlichman , H.R. Haldeman-wear them aboard . Even Nixon 's personal secretary , Rose Mary Woods , suits up . <P> Lately there is a new symbol of status . Free of charge , Washington 's C &; P Telephone Co. has installed ten of its still experimental " picturephones " in the offices of the highest presidential advisers . The gadgets , small TV sets attached to the telephone , allow the presidential elite to dial-in one another 's images as well as voices-not that any one of them is likely to forget what the others look like . <P> Apart from broadcasting status , the picturephones contribute little to the smoother workings of Government . To Egghead Kissinger , they are a technological mystery . He will not call on the device , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fussing as he tries to work the thing . " Technology gone mad , " he has been heard to mutter . One day when a picturephone call came in , Ehrlichman 's large , balding head materialized on Kissinger 's screen and his deep voice intoned : " Push the center button , Henry . "
