When the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel opened in 1964 , it was widely described as an engineering marvel and a surefire tourist attraction . Its 17 miles of open spans and underwater tunnels connect Virginia 's Cape Charles with the Norfolk area , uncorking what had been a major traffic bottleneck between New York and Florida . The 25-minute scenic crossing costs $4 for car and driver , plus 85 for each passenger-just pennies more than the old 90-minute ferry fare of $3.85 for car and driver . Yet traffic on the world 's longest bridge-tunnel has been only half of what the experts predicted . In 1969 , for example , drivers paid $8,100,000 in tolls , less than half of the originally projected revenues . This discrepancy may well cause an embarrassing default on some bond interest payments . <P> The bridge-tunnel cost $140 million , but to provide a reserve for a rainy day , Virginia 's state-run Bridge-Tunnel District raised $200 million in three bond issues . The reserve has been largely exhausted to pay interest during the past six money-losing years . Unless the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skip the second half-interest payment of $2,875,000 on $100 million of 5% C-series bonds next July . In that event , the interest obligation would accumulate but would be paid only if and when funds are available . Venturesome investors can now buy a $1,000 C bond for $310 . <P> Matter of Integrity . Officials of the district cling to the faint hope that Virginia 's general assembly will bail out the bridge-tunnel , though the state has no legal obligation to vote financial aid . Such a move would cost the state $5 million a year , initially . There are questions about the propriety of using tax money to pay off the bonds . The matter has caused anxious debate in the assembly , where the argument for support is that the state 's reputation for fiscal integrity would be tarnished if Virginia let the bond issue of a political subdivision go into default . <P> Why is traffic on the bridge-tunnel so far below predictions ? One reason is that improvements on the feeder highways to the north and south have fallen behind schedule . Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Highway , was finished ahead of time and has siphoned off much long-distance traffic . The original traffic projections also underestimated the increasing use of air travel . <P> Traffic rose a heartening 7% during 1969 , but officials figure that the bridge-tunnel will not start to break even for another decade . An average of 105,518 cars , trucks and buses a month have been using the span , mostly on weekends . On weekdays , the roadways of the superspan are often deserted-except for clusters of seagulls.
