txt Opponents of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi , elated by the - surprise defection of her senior Cabinet minister , conferred tonight on how to encourage further defections and unify opposition . in the campaign for next month 's Parliament elections . In a major political development , Jagjivan Ram , a leading national figure who has peen in the Cabinet for 30 years , dramatically resigned from the Cabinet and from the Congress Party this morning with a stinging denunciation of the 19 months of stern emergency rule here . Ram a National Figure " Citizens of the country have been deprived of all their freedoms , " said Mr. Ram , the Agriculture Minister , in his resignation letter to Mrs. Gandhi . " A fear psychosis has overtaken the whole nation . People are living in a state of constant fear and are silently suffering . " Like Mrs. Gandhi , Mr. Ram is one of India 's few truly national figures , with a broad base of support . Because of that base , his defection changed the whole nature of the campaign , posing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister 's party . Mr. Ram , who is one of India 's 85 million untouchables , has a wide following among this minority group and a firm political base in his native Bihar , India 's second most populous state . When he quit the party this morning , asserting that it had " ceased to be a democratic organization , " the 68-year-old // minister took with him five other Congress Party leaders , including the former chief ministers of the states of Uttar Pradesh and Orissa . But political insiders on both sides of the dispute said that he would still have to win over one or two really major figures , preferably Cabinet ministers , to achieve a real party split like the one that divided the Congress Party in 1960 . For that reason , the next few days are regarded as crucial . At his roomy beige home in the old colonial section of New Delhi , Mr. Ram spent the day in meetings with backers , trying to work out a strategy to attract more defectors and to forge a united opposition . Half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other Congress Party leaders to shore up their defenses . The party 's high command issued a statement calling Mr. Ram 's move " an act of bad faith , " and the Prime Minister said she was " astounded . " In her letter accepting Mr. Ram 's resignation , she said , qt is strange that you should have remained silent all these months , but should make these baseless charges now , " after the recent substantial relaxation of the emergency . " You were actively and directly associated with every decision in the conduct of the national policies . You fully supported our policies . rnti never expresssd i:ny reservations or doubt . " ? Mr. Ram 's angry defection , and his appeal to other government supporters to join him , appeared to insure not only that the election campaign would be a real contest , but also that its major issue would be the emergency rule that was imposed upon India on June 26 , 1975 . Mr. Ram and the other Congress defectors did not join the Janata Party , the principal opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin March 16 . But he indicated a degree of cooperation when he said that his new group , called Congress for Democracy , would try to avoid " triangular contests , " in which both opposition parties field candidates to the benefit of the Congress Party . Janata leaders called at Mr. Ram 's house all day with congratulations and offers of cooperation . The party ; announced that its leader , Jaya Prakash Narayan , who also comes , from Bihar , would appear with Mr. Ram at a big rally here Sunday . " All democrats in the country will join us in welcoming the clear and unequivocal stand for democracy of Jagjivan Ram , " the Janata Party ' said . " It shows that at the critical fate-laden moment , the traditions of our freedom movement assert themselves . " Mr. Ram , who like most leading Indian politicians spent some time in British jails during the struggle for independence , also referred to that period in the joint statement issued this morning . Recalling " the call of the motherland to free her from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls once again to guard and preserve democracy , to protect human values so that India and India alone becomes strong and prosperous . The coming general elections provide perhaps the last opportunity for preventing the total reversal of the nation 's cherished policies , and for correcting the illegitimacy that predominates in several aspects of our national life . " When Mrs. Gandhi made her surprise election call two weeks ago , her Government lifted press censorship , released leading political prisoners and permitted the resumption of political activities , which had been banned since the declaration of the emergency . But the leaders of the new Congress for Democracy said more had , to be done . They demanded the cancellation of the emergency  --  which has only been suspended  --  the repeal of a far-reaching censorship law enacted a year ago , and the release of all remaining political prisoners . Those who joined Mr. ' Ram in signing the statement were Nandini Satpathy , former chief minister of Orissa , H. N. Bahuguna , former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh , Mrs. Gandhi 's home state ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gandhi 's Cabinet ; D. N. Tiwari , a Member of Parliament , and R. M.
