txt LETTERS pg . 258 Moral Fiction To the Editor . After reading John Gardner 's review of " Tsuga 's Children " ( May 15 ) , I find myself wondering exactly what grudge he has against Thomas Williams . I say grudge because this is not a review , but an exercise in name-calling . When Gardner turns a review of a children 's novel into an attack on another novelist 's entire oeuvre , and when most of his argument is carried by loaded language and naked assertion , it seems more personal than critical . Gardner starts out by excluding Williams from the ranks of " serious " novelists , calling him " a preacher and an entertainer . " He makes writing and reading serious novels sound like pumping iron : " If ( Williams deals with weighty matters , he does not deal with them weightily . " ( A statement that demands Wagnerian tuba for accompaniment . ) Gardner uses the adjective " Hollywood " like a blunt instrument or a Pavlovian trigger : this is especially obvious in the overkill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having " Hollywood-style nobility : the sharp simplicity of myth , or more properly , the TV adventure-story animated cartoon . " Gardner says " preaching .. . in novels for children .. . makes him cross . " ( He was probably cross already , but let that pass . ) The use of " preaching " as a pejorative might make us forget to ask for a moment what Gardner would call the clear moral statements of all sorts of children 's classics , from " The King of the Golden River " and " The Princess and the Goblin " to " The Chronicles of Narnia , " " A Wrinkle in Time , " or Susan Cooper 's " The Dark Is Rising . " Even the word " noble , " when applied to . Williams 's children , is negative . -0 e wonders what the author of " Grendel " would say if the author of " Beowulf " had written in modern English prose . Gardner says the " language , emotions and surprising heroics " of various characters and creatures " recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hardy Boys . " Another bit of overkill : surely the scholar of the Gawaine-poet and Chaucer can tell the difference between the rhetoric ' of Bomba and that of Raggedy Ann . Unless of course . Gardner would characterize the language of my imaginary modern " Beowulf " as recalling Tolkien , William Morris , Michael Crichton and Stan Lee 's Thor . Gardner goes so far as to characterize Williams 's reasoning as " quasi-mystical " ( surely even worse than " mystical , " though many people misuse that word as meaning merely " fuzzy-thinking " ) and finally reduces the story to a warning against eating meat from the A. &P.; ( calling Williams a sadist in passing ) . The price of eating meat is spilling blood , and I suspect a tour of a stockyard would turn some of us vegetarian . ( Incidentally , the convenience of modem technological warfare is largely in not knowing what you 're doing in all its gory detail ; think of the B-52 pilots dropping bombs on coordinates and never seeing their targets . ) But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the rest of us . I would n't go on at such length if I thought Gardener 's motives in writing the review were purely literary . JOHN A. TAYLOR Washington , Pa . John Gardner replies : Mr. Taylor 's main objection is legitimate . In a review of a single book , I should n't have expressed my opinion on Williams 's entire " oeuvre , " since to do so without giving proofs is obviously unfair , however true my naked assertion may be . Also , and more important , it 's of no use either to Thomas Williams or to the reader . As for the rest , Mr. Taylor is wrong , though on rereading my review I can see that his emotion is understandable . I have nothing personal against Thomas Williams , and it is certainly true that no other work of his I 've seen is as bad , by any means , as " Tsuga 's Children . " He 's a gifted , sometimes even brilliant writer , whose sentimental streak infuriates me , since it ruins good novels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fault in my own fiction . I 'm also hypersensitive on another point : I keep talking about " moral fiction " and have a book on the subject coming out . Easy moralizing is regularly confounded with what I understand as moral fiction , and I 'm afraid I used Thomas Williams 's work as an excuse to express my anger at the confusion . What I say about the faults of ' Tsuga 's Children " is surely true , otherwise Taylor would not call my attack " overkilL " Nevertheless , a reviewer should be instructive , not cruel . Cruelty , as everyone knows , is one of the most common forms - of sentimentality , whether it appears in " Tsuga 's Children " or in my review of it . Or in Mr. Taylor 's silly letter . Correction To the Editor I just received a copy of the June 26 book review , which includes my review of Suzi Gablik 's " Progress in Art . " There is a serious mistake in the last sentence , that totally contradicts what I had intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude that " There is no solution because there is no problem . " My final sentence was intended to read " Of course , there can be no solution if one does not acknowledge that there is a problem . " The word " not " was omitted in the printed text , so that it appears I have the same . . . attitude I attribute to Duchamp and Gablik . I realize that it is late to refer to the review , but I am much embarrassed by the apparent lack of consistency in my review , and would appreciate a correction . BARBARA ROSE Perugia , Italy Josephine To the Editor : . It has taken some time for Ishmael Reed 's review of Stephen Papich 's " Remembering Josephine " ( Dec. 12 ) to reach me and to be translated for me into French . It has distressed and angered me almost beyond expression . On behalf of our 12 children , myself and the memory of my wife and their mother , I fervently request what in France we call the droit de reponse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reed 's review is his compounding of the ugly , vulgar and indecent aspects of Mr. Papich 's book  --  many of which are untrue , totally or partially inaccurate or grossly exaggerated ? by adding shocking and totally unfounded comments of his own . " The children hated each other " ? that is a lie ; " ungrateful wretches " who called Josephine " a ? slut " ? where is his proof ? ? The children 's behavior causing Josephine a heart attack  --  ridiculous . Josephine suffeted from a heart condition ever since 1942 , when she was 36 , - during the period in which she worked for the French Secret Service and the Resistance in Morocco , 25 years before the first children were adopted . " Junkies , thieves , bleeders and cry-babies " ? I have - six of the children with me now in Buenos Aires . I am in constant touch with other six in Europa . Mr. Reed need only know them to realize it is an untruth and a disgrace to classify them as the dregs of society ... " Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , agonies. mar takes or weaknesses of my wife , she was not pitiful ! Her pity for the unfortunate was overwhelming and endless , but she would have been humiliated and disgusted by anyone who might have dared to show pity for her . Even when she begged and borrowed to save the chateau Milandes , she did it as a convinced petitioner for an ideal , a dream , a cause , not as a mendicant looking for a handout . She lost Milandes . She was thrown out bodily , screaming and fighting to the end . Of course , the terrible despair was there , but it was the despair of the Old Testament zealots and prophets , and still , she never gave up . Until the day she died , she was convinced that she would find legal grounds for getting Milandes back and to reinstate her extraordmary dream of universal Ekternity . In her heart , she Sever lost Milandes . In her heart , she was never defeated .
