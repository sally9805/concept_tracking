 | Watergate Was War , Not Politics THE Watergate scandal , it is clear , is different ? truly different ? from all the scandals that have preceded it in our history . It is this difference that makes Watergate so frightening . All those other scandals ? Credit Mobilier , the Whisky Ring , Teapot Dome , Sherman Adams and his vicuna coat , Bobby Baker and his wheeling and dealing ? were motivated by greed , an emotion effortlessly understood by almost all of us . But the Watergate men seem to have been motivated by more complex emotions ? by a certain selfrighteousness , by fear , by a special kind of political-ideological hatred . As a result , the people who were running the President 's election campaign were not really running the kind of campaign this country has known since the party system was founded . They were not practicing politics . They were making war , a special kind of war . The kind of war they were making has been made between nations for a long time now , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not within this nation . The spiritual ancestor of the Committee to Re-elect the President , better known as CREEP , is boSS . The Office of Strategic Services , in which this writer served , was this country 's first serious attempt to wage war by covert and unconventional means . oss was patterned on the British Secret Services , and the Central Intelligence Agency has in turn been patterned on oss . In fact , all the world 's secret services , including Russia 's KGB , have four main missions . In oss , they were called S.I . ( Secret Intelligence ) , S.O . ( Secret Operations ) , M.O . ( Morale Operations ) and X-2 ( Black Propaganda ) . CREEP 's covert operations fit into  | was condemned to a long jail term , would have been regarded as among the bravest and the best .

Watergate is as deadly and seri ous a business as this reporter has seen in a quarter century of covering politics . For Watergate has been an attempt to alter the very nature of the ancient American political system . Politicians have played tricks on each other since politics was invented . But this is not politics ; this is war . The special form of warfare waged by oss against Adolf Hitler was morally justified by the moral necessity to destroy Nazism . The more limited and circumspect form of warfare waged by the CIA against the KGB , and vice versa , is also justified by hard necessity . But to transfer such secret-service techniques , on an obviously planned and organized basis , to the internal American political process is a genuinely terrifying innovation . Any person proven to have used these techniques should not only be punished by the law ; he should be banned forever from participation in American politics . the same categories .

So was the faked telegram from President John Kennedy to the Saigon mission , calling , in effect , for the assassination of Diem . The burglarization of the office of Daniel Ellsberg 's psychiatrist was essentially an S.I . operation . If successful , it would no doubt have been used as part of a major morale operation . The operation in which CREEP arranged to flood the White House with telegrams supporting the President 's Vietnamese policy was of course a morale operation . So was that in which homosexuals were allegedly hired to give ostentatious support to Senator McGovern . The mission of Donald H. Segretti , who was generously rewarded by Mr. Nixon 's private lawyer , Herbert W. Kalmbach , was to head an intelligence network . Segretti was clearly also expected to do some morale-operations work . One even recognizes in the people who have surfaced in CREEP some of the same sort of people as in wartime oss .
