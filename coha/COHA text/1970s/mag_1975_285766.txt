Even as Cambodia and South Viet Nam were falling to Communist armies , millions of dollars in U.S. aid to those countries were still surging through the pipeline across the Pacific . The Defense and State Departments acted immediately to turn off the flow : they rescinded letters of credit to recipients , canceled orders to suppliers , and cabled ships at sea to " frustrate " their cargoes ( that is , dump them ) at the nearest port . Result : military aid was routed directly to U.S. bases but non-military goods are piling up in warehouses all over Asia , especially in Singapore , Bangkok , Hong Kong and Manila . <P> <P> The U.S. Agency for International Development ( AID ) has dispatched a dozen or so troubleshooters in the Far East to take inventory of the orphaned aid and figure out something to do with it . They have found that goods are still pouring in as if conjured up by some sorcerer 's apprentice , even though it is scarcely conceivable that the shippers would not have got Kissinger 's orders by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the woodwork for the next 45 to 60 days , " sighs Clifford Frink , 54 , senior AID man in Hong Kong . <P> Estimates of how much the troubleshooters may eventually find range from $50 million to $100 million or more . It is a cornucopia of miscellany- " everything from vaginal foam to cement mixers , " says one AID official . Among the items found so far : tin plate , steel sheet , chemicals , dies , pumps , cotton , newsprint , forklift trucks , photocopying machines . Says Frink in Hong Kong : " We have part of a rice mill . It may be an entire rice mill-I wo n't know until I get into the boxes . The same thing with an edible oil mill . There is a big shipment of ladles . Our hunch is that they are ladles for pouring glass . " <P> What to do with it all ? AID officials will divert some of the goods to nations that the U.S. is still assisting , not to expand programs but to fill existing commitments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go primarily to Bangladesh , India and perhaps Egypt . But industrial goods pose a much tougher problem . They were intended for the sophisticated economic base that the U.S. wanted to build in South Viet Nam until the very end . ( The Mayaguez , for instance , was unloading 3,000 tons of industrial goods-just what is still not clear-when it hastily had to leave Saigon in mid-April . ) AID officials are committed to no similar development of other aid-receiving nations , and while they look around for a use for the goods , hefty warehouse bills are piling up . <P> AID will try to persuade suppliers in the U.S. to buy back some of the homeless goods . Whatever they do not want will have to be peddled to Asian entrepreneurs , some of whom are already expressing interest . Their average offer so far : 10 on the dollar .
