THE WOMEN by CLARE BOOTHE LUCE <P> This is a vigorous , thoroughly entertaining revival of Clare Boothe Luce 's saucy 1936 saga of bare-knuckled Eves . Interestingly enough , the play is something of a rarity in terms of the U.S. theater 's comic tradition in recent decades . We have grown accustomed to kooky comedy , sight-and-gag comedy , situation comedy and even black comedy . But Mrs. Luce writes social comedy . <P> The genre disappeared after World War II because the class structure mirrored in the play came to an end with that event . Implicit in the play is a great divide between superiors and inferiors , patricians and plebeians . However they err , the patricians are sanctified by wealth , birth and breeding . Whether they are openly envious or openly critical , the plebeians are content or resigned to being maids , manicurists or powder-room attendants . From the vantage point of 1973 , one of the fascinations of The Women is that it is positively class-ridden . <P> The central conflict of the play is a plebeian foray into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfume clerk , seduces and steals the husband of Mary Haines ( Kim Hunter ) . Since Mary is a pretty decent woman compared with her feline friends , audience sympathy gravitates to her . Crystal is a steely predator who wants her share of the spoils , but as an arriviste , she can not keep her social footing . She is caught out in another liaison , and Mary gets her husband back . In effect , the lower orders have been chastised for their presumption . <P> The irony is that the social heights to which Crystal aspires operate on a code of ethics no more elevated than hers . These women lie , cheat on their cheating husbands , booze it up and assassinate each other 's characters between brunch and bridge . Even while she gives tongue to their malice , Mrs. Luce clearly sees them as parasites who neither toil nor spin , except for their cunning webs of mischief . Like a social anthropologist , she follows these felines to their lairs-exercise parlors , hairdresser sessions , nightclub powder rooms . In an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's assumption that women are as much a conspiracy as a sex , and Mrs. Luce reveals that the conspiracy is centered on him-how to get a man and how to hold him . <P> The humor that makes The Women such a savory pleasure is as much of a rarity as the play . Mrs. Luce 's lines border on the aphoristic , but they lack the pith and elegance of fine aphorisms . Her true forte is the sniper fire of sarcasm in which one character fells another in midstep or midsentence . Many of these lines fall to the busybody superbitch played by Alexis Smith , and she is a past mistress of the lethal riposte . <P> Split between old film hands and old stage hands , the cast is uneven in performance . Making her Broadway debut as Mary 's mother , Myrna Loy , 68 , seemed apprehensive in her entrances and exits and confined her delivery to flat recitation . Also making her first Broadway appearance , Rhonda Fleming , 49 , seemed to be posing for a camera rather than playing to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Louise Wilson are tartly expert comediennes , and Jan Miner is wonderfully hilarious as a countess addicted to husbands ( five ) and alcohol ( 90-proof ) . <P>
