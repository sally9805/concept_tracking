A group of third-and fourth-graders swarmed through the Vermont statehouse last January and persuaded legislators to designate Apis mellifera ( the honeybee ) as the state 's official insect . Argued one of the young lobbyists : " Bees are industrious , just like us Vermonters . " The bill was duly signed into law by Governor Richard A. Snelling . <P> At noon one day last week , 10,000 bees droned into Montpelier and settled under the eaves near the Governor 's office . " It 's probably just a delegation to thank Governor Snelling , " joked Beekeeper Emile ( " Beaver " ) Couillard , 65 , as he climbed a ladder 50 ft. to reach the gathering insects . Couillard , who likes bees as much as any other industrious Vermonter , took the swarm home to his hives , where he expects them to produce about $150 worth of honey this year-enough to take the sting out of his job .
