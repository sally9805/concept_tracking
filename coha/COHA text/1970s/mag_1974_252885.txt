THE GREAT MacDADDY <P> by PAUL CARTER HARRISON <P> There is a moment in The Great MacDaddy when a group is seated around the table at Mother Faith 's St. Louis boardinghouse playing cards . <P> An old man , gesturing with his half-pint of Imperial , harangues the assemblage in a woozily dis gusted lecture on black pride , or the lack of it . Infected by his rhythms , the card players and their women begin , raggedly at first , then with a soulful swell , to sing Amazing Grace , coloring the hymn with a chaotic ardor and subtlety that would surely alarm any white missionary . It is not conventional hallelujah ; like much of this odd , ritualistic musical , the moment has a certain magnificent energy that leaves one feeling lonely when it is over . <P> MacDaddy , which is the season 's first production by Manhattan 's Negro Ensemble Company , is a free-form , episodic jour ney through black people 's time . It ranges across 20th century America , criss crossing decades . MacDaddy ( David Downing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vintner on the trail of his vanished friend Wine , who represents a lost magic , the secret of the race . A funky and inventive Candide , MacDaddy travels through peckerwood racism , black venality , Tomism and the death's-head enemy , heroin . <P> His adventures are organized as a sequence of sketches , or " beats , " as Play wright Harrison calls them , with many of the 17 cast members playing a variety of roles - a deacon , a shuffling Stepin Fetchit , crapshooters , addicts . <P> They speak dialects that fall into scatty rhyme , slick and ingenious , while Cole ridge-Taylor Perkinson 's music runs from gospel to voodoo to jazz . The evening is a fairly dense and ambitious odyssey that flirts with incoherence and goes on a bit too long . But the trip is worth it . In a season of obsessive nostalgia , MacDaddy at least has blood in it , and not embalming fluid .
