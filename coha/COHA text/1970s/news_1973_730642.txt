txt That middle-aged woman in the greasy coveralls is the latest sign of do-it-yourself desperation in the United States . The inner workings of the automobile have long mystified many owners and drivers ; but now the four-wheeled public is fighting back ? with wrenches and hoists . In Chicago , Detroit , Boston , and half a dozen other cities , do-it-yourself garages are opening up and enterprising motorists are taking auto repair courses and rolling up their sleeves to take advantage of the new trend . " On the weekends people are waiting in line when we open , " says Leonard W. Larson , co-owner of Chicago 's first such garage . " We expect by next year it will be on an appointment-only basis . " " It 's a complete self-service garage , where a person can do anything he wants to do from an oil change to overhauling a motor , putting in shocks , or rotating tires , " he says of his Automotive Hobby Shop . Expansion talk heard Opening only last August , the Hobby Shop has done such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other garages . They plan to start a franchise business within a few weeks . Would-be mechanics can rent stalls at the Hobby Shop garage for $3 an hour complete with a full array of tools and repair equipment , including hoists . The daily rate for lengthy repairs runs $20 . The garage is open 14 hours a day , six days a week , plus six hours on Sunday . Parts can be purchased at discount rates . " Most people come to us because they 're dissatisfied with hodgepodge service they get on the outside and fed up with the high cost of repairs . The feeling is , generally : ' I 'm going to try myself , I ca n't do any worse , ' " says Mr. Larson . A tune-up may normally cost anywhere from $65 to $80 in a repair shop , but a do-it-yourselfer can do the job for about $20 . ( Mechanics are standing by to help , if needed , at Mr. Larson 's garage . " We do n't want anyone hung up here , but we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Estimate of the savings Most self-service garages estimate motorists can save 50 percent or more on repair costs by doing the work themselves . Women have not shied away from the grease-pit revolution . " Some 40 percent of the people taking our auto repair course are women , " says Walter B. Rasmussen , director of adult education for the Evanston ( Illinois ) Township High school . One graduate proudly told her instructor : " I 've already paid for the ( $18 ) course in oil changes alone . " Interest has mushroomed so much in the last few years that the Evanston program , like many around the country , has had to expand to offer to more than just a basic " know your car " course . Professional mechanics are not yet too worried about being thrown out of a job . They realize laymen may quickly learn to change oil or spark plugs , but when it comes to something like the automatic transmission , ignition system , or wheel alignment , most people just do n't have the time to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Rasmussen . " But this is consumer education as much as anything else . It gives motorists a basic knowledge of their car , so they wo n't be fooled . With spiraling costs bombarding the consumer on every side , this latest effort at economy is not likely to be a passing craze.
