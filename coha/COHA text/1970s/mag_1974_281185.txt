FIND YOUR WAY HOME by JOHN HOPKINS <P> This is the familiar triangle plot with one rather unsettling difference-the " other woman " is a young man . Alan Harrison ( Lee Richardson ) is a respectable British businessman of 47 . He has been married for 20 years and is the father of two grown children . For some 15 years he has been a compulsive philanderer , mostly with women . Yet the only genuine and wrenching affection he has felt has been for a man young enough to be his son : 23-year-old Julian Weston ( Michael Moriarty ) . A year before the play begins , Alan had left Julian . Now he has been impelled instinctively to return . <P> The drama unfolds with undistracted simplicity , eloquence and force . In Act I , Julian reveals the anguish and hysteria to which he was driven by Alan 's abandonment . The two are reconciled and go to bed together . In Act II , Alan 's wife Jacqueline makes a touching plea for Alan 's return , but he refuses . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : that he has been the most indiscriminate sort of male prostitute . Yet the two men finally agree that to deny their love for each other would be to make life not worth living . <P> Find Your Way Home is the most outspoken and honest play about homo sexuality that has ever appeared on Broadway . Yet nothing is said or done onstage in order to titillate an audience of either gays or straights . British Play wright Hopkins makes three serious points and makes them well . The first of these affirms what Diana Trilling has written of D.H . Lawrence : " The sexual ity which Lawrence celebrated was mat ing . What the present generation means by love-making is coupling . " Alan and Julian make love in Lawrence 's sense . <P> Secondly , Hopkins shows how heavily attitudes toward homosexuality are socially conditioned . If Alan were leaving his wife for another woman , she would be dismayed but resigned . It is the social stigma and the half-sniggering , half-pitying gossip of friends and acquaintances that disturb her so deeply . <P> Hopkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so great a writer as Proust - is that love is indivisible . Whatever its form of expression , the essence of love never differs . Hopkins never makes any of these points as didactic arguments . <P> They are implicit in his play and made explicit by a fine cast . Jane Alexander is exceptional in conveying grief , shock and wifely possessiveness . And Moriarty , Richardson , and John Ramsey as a one-night pickup , never take an emotionally false step .
