IT was not the usual , formal embassy party , but rather a friendly get-together among off-duty diplomats . As the senior envoy in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum , Saudi Arabian Ambassador Abdullah al Malhouk had invited other mission heads to say farewell last Thursday to George Curtis Moore , 47 , a popular U.S. Foreign Service officer and first-rate Arabist . After serving as the ranking U.S. diplomat in the Sudan for more than three years , Moore was being replaced by Ambassador Cleo A. Noel Jr. , 54 , and returning to Washington for reassignment . At around 7 p.m. , after Moore had been presented with a silver tray and the guests were starting to leave , the cool Khartoum evening was suddenly shattered with terror . <P> A pair of Land Rovers screeched up to the front gate of the four-story embassy villa . One rammed a limousine waiting for Noel . Seven men leaped out firing automatic weapons at random . The departing diplomats scurried for cover . " Run , run , run for your life ! " shouted the Dutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambassadors , managed to escape . The French ambassador got away by scaling a seven-foot garden wall . The Papal Nuncio in Khartoum slipped out a side gate . <P> But Noel , a career officer in his first ambassadorial post , was nicked in the leg by a bullet and Belgian Charg d'Affaires Guy Bid was hit in the foot . They , along with others , were forced back into the embassy . Once they got inside , the terrorists rounded up more diplomats , including the Hungarian and Yugoslav envoys who unsuccessfully tried to hide in the roof garden . <P> The invaders quickly identified themselves as members of Black September , the Palestinian guerrilla group that murdered eleven Israelis at the Munich Olympics last summer . Holding a sort of mock court in which the captives were judged according to their country 's attitude toward the Palestinian cause , they singled out as hostages the two Americans , Noel and Moore ( whom they bound and beat ) , Belgian Eid , Saudi Host Al Malhouk and Jordanian Charg d'Affaires Adly al Nasser . The choices did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have strongly opposed the Palestinian guerrilla movement , Saudi Arabia has been ambivalent , giving financial support to both Jordan and the terrorists . As for Eid , it seemed he was mistaken by his captors for a Jew ; in fact , his forebears were Egyptian . One diplomat unsuccessfully sought by the commandos was the West German ambassador , who missed the party at the last minute because of another engagement . <P> With the five hostages chosen , everyone else , including the Saudi ambassador 's wife and children , was released . Each freed diplomat was given a mimeographed sheet of paper with a statement of apology to the Saudi government for using its embassy as the scene of the attack , and to Sudan for staging it on Unity Day , a national holiday celebrating the first anniversary of the end of Sudan 's 17-year-long civil war .
