txt ALMA CAMPBELL IS AFRAID to sleep . She 's terrified to . She fights it every night . She is scared to death that when her weary eyes finally flicker and close , and her mind drifts off and her senses relax , it will happen again . So Alma Campbell seldom sleeps anymore . Neither does her husband , Lonnie , nor her five children . And when they finally do give in and doze , they often awaken with a heart-thumping jolt in the middle of the night and run to the window just to make sure it is n't happening again . For it has happened six times already . Six times in three weeks that they 've been off their guard by . falling asleep , Close-up With Anne Keegan only to be awakened by tearful shouts and screaming and the frantic barking of their two dogs . Through the curtains of their windows they 'll see it ? the flames shooting out of the abandoned building next door , leaping across the four-foot gangway , reaching out to lick at their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so the night now brings with // 11110 From page one They live in fear of nighttime arson // It the terror that the place will burn , again . " Every little sound we hear dyer there , " said Alma , " the rats scurrying in that empty building over the broken glass , or the wind  --  everything makes us jump up and run and look out the window and then call the police and . beg them to come look at the place to see if someone is in there , setting it on fire again . " We do n't sleep In this house anymore . We just lie ' down in our rooms in ? trances , wondering if we 'll all go up in flames . " The abandoned building at 534 N. Noble St. that sits so close to the Campbell 's neat little home Is not boarded up . It 's full of the putrid stench of charred wood and plaster and burned out old mattresses  --  its doors wide open , its winlows yawning empty of glass , just ripe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first fire was early on a Sunday corning when people were sleeping , " raid Lonnie Campbell . " The third floor vas vacant but there were people living in the second floor , the first floor , and a the basement . The whole third floor went up . By evening everyone In the . wilding moved out so it became vacant . Ithe first fire did not alarm us too much , we thought lt might have been electrical . " BUT THE SECOND fire came just three days later . It started on the first floor . And the third fire came just a few days after that . The third fire came the following Sunday , again , while everyone was asleep . " We all know it 's arson . Empty buildings just do n't start up by themselves . Somebody 's setting those fires , and we 're afraid that it 's going to take our house and all of us with it . " " After the second fire , " Alma said , " one of the firemen came over to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these days the firemen . might not get there in time and stop , tt from burning us down . He told me ' to call the mayor 's office and the alderman 's office . He told me to keeping calling and calling . " I called the mayor 's office four times . They were n't listening much to me and the last time I started choking up and crying , saying , ' Ca n't you please get this building torn down ? ' Cause If it does n't come down ? I 'm going to have a nervous breakdown ! ? " I TOLD THEN WE are all tired ? that everynight we have to stay up and try to patrol the place with flashlights looking to see if the arsonist has crept in there . I told this person it was a matter of life and death . " This person said to me , ' What do you mean by life and death ! ' and I said , ' Just that . My family 's life is at stake . Cant the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us torn down so it does n't burn again ! ' " The fourth fire came not much later and the Campbells ' dogs alerted them that the abandoned building was burning . The fifth fire came on a Thursday , June 14th , at 330 a.m . A huge explosion shook the neighborhood awake and the empty building burst into flames . , ' We 'd been staying up to guard but we finally all collapsed from exhaustion  --  and then it happened , " said Alma . " Like they knew . Like they were waiting . I woke up crying and shouted , ' Lord , Mercy God . It 's that building again ! ' " The police called me that day and said they 'd be watching the building and said , ' Fine . But I wo n't rest till that building is clean gone . ' " AND WOULD YOU believe that at 6:30 the next morning , after the police must have left , the place went up again . There 's no rest for us now . I ca n't eat anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never know when it will happen again . " I called the alderman 's office and he was real nice , but he said it could take months for the city to tear down this building and I do n't know if we 'll last that long . I do n't know if we 'll live to see it , ' cause it 's going to burn sometime soon , like it 's done before when we 're asleep again . There 's nothing to stop it Anybody can walk by and toss gasoline and a match in it . We 're living in this city scared to death . " If we were renting , we 'd be gone . But we own this house and we ca n't go anywhere . " The Campbells have worked hard on their house . They bought it on contract two years ago and in several months they will have paid it all off . It is the first house they have ever owned and they are proud of it . BUT THEY ARE also afraid for lit because they have little fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back up again . At least one member of the family stays up all night , or they sleep in shifts and patrol . " I 'm scared . I 'm scared it 's going to happen again , mom , and it 'll jump to our house and we wo n't be able to get out , " said daughter Sheila , breaking down from exhaustion one morning at 2 am. after making her rounds of the abandoned building . " Now do n't worry , " said Alma Campbell , running her fingers nervously through her hair . " God 's a'watching over us , even if the city isn't. "
