txt Letters to the Editor pg . 40 Letters to the Editor Public Employees : The Periled Pensions To the Editor : The legislation enacted in Albany on Dec. 6 and a recent decision by Supreme Court Justice Hyman Korn may seriously jeopardize the pension rights of state and municipal employees , not only in New York City but throughout the entire nation . The law passed by the State Legislature empowers city pension trustees to make investments to protect the solvency of New York City . This means that they now have a dual responsibility , to the pensioners on the one hand and to the solvency of the city on the other , but with no mandate as to which has priority . Thus their role as trustees has been basically altered . In addition , the recent law protects the trustees from damage suits for losses from investing in city bonds , the liability being shifted to the city income tax . Pensions are construed as essential city services , but so also are fire and police protection , here again without the determination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one dollar left , it could go to pay a policeman 's or fireman 's salary rather than to a pensioner . The decision of Justice Korn in dismissing the suit of Selma Simpson to enjoin the purchase of M.A.C . bonds is also revolutionary . In his words , the case was dismissed because " the court may not interfere with the pension To Guard a Foreign V.I.P. To the Editor : President Ford 's veto of the Congressional bill that would have authorized modest reimbursement to local governments for furnishing protection to visiting foreign dignitaries raises a very important question . When will . a Anti-Sadat Demonstration , Oct. 29 Mayor of the City of New York have the guts to proclaim publicly that the city will no longer provide so much as a single police officer to guard visiting diplomats because no policemen can be spared from their regular duties and there is no money available to pay for overtime ? BERNARD LIEBMAN Dobbs Ferry , N. Y. , Dec. 3 , 1975 On Curbing Tax Cheats To the Editor : A recent letter captioned " The Cheating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning less Wheat Sales to Moscow : A Case for $55 Bushels To the Editor : The Soviet Union has become an ardent supporter of OPEC and its pricing policies . It has chastised China for shading prices below the " cartel " levels . It has stubbornly resisted pricing oil at levels below those posted by the cartel in oil/wheat negotiations with the United States . It has given economic and political support to OPEC and its pricing policies . This being the case , the same rules should then apply to the Soviet Union when pricing our wheat . Production costs for oil in Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , etc. , are considerably less than 50 cents per barrel . This oil is being sold at the current OPEC cartel price of over $11 per barrel . A markup from 50 cents of 2,200 percent . It costs an efficient American farmer approximately $2.50 to produce a bushel of wheat . By the same yardstick then , wheat sold to the Soviet Union or to OPEC countries should be priced at $55 per bushel . Simultaneously , it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it is a diminishing resource is invalid . We are already a net importer of three of the four basic elements : nitrogen ( as ammonia ) , potash and sulphur needed by our farmers to fertilize the soil and grow our crops annually . Only in phosphates are we a net exporter . Our agricultural sector requires literally scores of millions of tons of these elements every year to fertilize the land . Each of them is a diminishing resource as well . RAYMOND J. LEARSY New York , Dec. 5 , 1975 board 's exercise of its discretion to make these choices . " Yet in a number of prior cases , the courts have interfered with investment decisions of trustees when they threatened the solvency of pension funds . If beneficiaries of trust funds have no right to challenge these decisions , the trustees then have absolute and unlimited powers . Taking this position establishes a dangerous precedent threatening not only public but private beneficiaries in all forms of trusts . But perhaps the Korn decision implies that only the acts of public trustees may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public pensioners are being denied their constitutional right to equal protection of the laws . Congress has enacted legislation giving private pensioners protection through enforcement of the " prudent man " principle and the diversification of investments . Why should public pensioners have any less protection than private pensioners ? A bill should now be introduced in Congress extending the provisions of the Federal Retirement Income Security Act to public pensions . WILLIAM WITHERS Eatontown , N.

" A guarantee of maximum payment is , however , not apt to be realized through introduction of special stamps , as the letter writer maintains .

MORGANSEN Jackson Heights , N. Y. , Dec. 4 , 1975 Generous City Hall . To the Editor : This taxpayer is aghast at the generous gift the city is giving to the Yankees . You list $7,000 to carpet the floor of the team 's general offices , $215,000 for a tarpaulin to cover the field , and all this when we are closing health facilities , day-care and old-age centers , when we are halting work on schools already under construction . I believed that our additional taxes were needed to keep our city alive and not to furnish luxuries to a baseball team .

On the other hand , it voted for the Arab-Communist-sponsored anti-Zionist U.N . resolution , agreeing that the Zionist ideology is racist , therefore the overwhelming majority of the Jews are racists . Foreign Minister Emilio 0 . Rabasca curtly declared : " Mexico is a sovereign country and can vote as it chooses . " He is quite right . We Jews are also sovereign individuals , and we spend our money as we choose . We just do n't like to sponsor those countries that slander us and our beliefs by calling us racists . It is as simple as that . EMERY BERCZELLER , M.D. New York , Dec. 1 , 1975 ? British Sharing To the Editor : H. M. Government 's recent announcement of partial autonomy for Scotland and Wales ( news story Nov. 28 ) while retaining all profits and rights to natural resources merely reinforces a Gaelic adage , " In Scotland only the problems are Scottish  --  everything else belongs to England . " One can not help but believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the man who throws scraps of rancid meat to appease a very angry dog he has just tried to beat into submission once too often . ( Rev. ) DOUGLAS G. SCOTT Tenafly , N. J. , Dec. 2 , 1975 The Peace-Mongers To the Editor : With the recent revelation of the harassment of Martin Luther King by the F.B.I. , I was struck with the similarity in treatment of another Nobel Prize winner , Dr. Sakharov of tits Soviet Union . Both , in winning the prize , seemed to have evoked from their respective governments reactions which could only be interpreted as hostile . One also might wonder whether the similarity of response really means a similar disapproval of the search for peace by both Governments . There is no question that the Bill of Rights has been defiled by the F.B.I. , at least in this situation . Its illegal acts of entry through wiretapping and threatening letters certainly seem more fitting to a less democratic government . Unfortunately , it seems that democracy and civil liberties have been too little respected in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is only a glimmer , is that these revelations are being made . It hurts deeply to know that you are no better off in many ways than those under a different form of government . The essence probably comes down to the nature of man and how he uses power , and how his fears lead to the suppression and stifling of other voices about him . We must entertain an open and honest Government on all levels , subject to review by the Congress . This , . it seems to me , is a major lesson we have learned . The road is a very long ( ) tie and , unfortunately , in many spots a shameful one . JEFFREY H. GORDON , M.D. Greenvale , L. I. , Dec. 3 , 1975 ' ? Housing 's ' Hard Truth ' To the Editor : Ada Louise Huxtable 's recent ' column , " U.S. Faces Housing Emer-. gency , " is a remarkably accurate and succinct statement of exactly what the Federal Government has done to depress the housing market . It is true that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H.U.D. was able to persuade Congress to enact the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 , which passed the " problem of production back to the private sector . " In short , H.U.D. got its wish  --  a subsidy program for tenants but no Government assistance in financing . In today 's atmosphere of economic chaos , with the allure of belt-tightening , this policy was even embraced by some friends of housing in Congress . But now the hard truth must once again be learned  --  without Government mortgage insurance and low-interest financing , the private sector can not provide housing in America for any but the affluent . That is the Government 's necessary role ? but like an , ostrich 's , H.U.D. 's head is in the sand . And because of it , " housing is one of the most severe and tragic emergencies that this country faces . " " Belt-tightening " here is only storing up disaster for tomorrow . Federal investment in housing would do much to decrease unemployment , loosen the tight housing market and reduce the inevitable social tensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and socially positive , and beneficial to so many in our country . TOM FORRESTER LORD Executive Director Houston Housing Development Corp . Houston , Dec. 2 , 1975 ? Yesterday 's ' Quacks ' To the Editor : Your front page story on the increasing evidence of the role of diet in the causation of cancer ( Dec. 3 ) has implicit a lesson in humility for us all . In 1958 , I was employed by Symon Gould of the Health Guild , a distributor of vegetarian , organic gardening and other " crackpot " valetudinarian literature . Several branches of the Federal Government descended upon us in wrath , threatening prosecution and suspension of mailing privileges unless we agreed to cease and desist from the distribution of various books which made the same point which you headlined today . We could find no medical men or academic scientists willing to testify in our defense , since it was the official policy of the medical profession that one who argued for a relation between diet and cancer was ipso facto a " quack , " and we were forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having come a long way since the persecution of Galileo . Remember the fable of Aesop about the two sacks , the one we carry in front of us containing the faults of others and the one behind with our own faults ? And the statement of Nobel laureate Lorenz is also to point : " Those who have warned against the indiscriminate use of insecticides , pesticides and chemical preservatives have been discredited in an infamous way . " SAM ABRAMS Portsmouth , N. H. , Dec. 3 , 1975 ? The ** Gap To the Editor : I am a student in the sixth grade of Woodward Parkway School in Farmingdale . Our class was reading your editorial " The Origins of Man " City Edition , Nov. 5 . I believe there has been a slight mistake . The editorial states the Egyptian high culture produced the Sphinx and pyramids some 3.000 years ago . We learned in school the Sphinx and pyramids were built about 3.000 B.C. , which was 5,000 years ago since this is A.D. 1975 . . DENISE PISTONE Farmingdale , L.
