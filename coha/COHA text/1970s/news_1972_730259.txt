txt As President Nixon 's national-security adviser flew into Peking , his opposite number in the secret peace talks in Paris , North Vietnam Politburo member Le Duc Tho , flew out . Or nearly so ? Le Duc Tho left the Chinese capital in fact 30 hours before Dr. Kissinger 's arrival . Le Duc Tho had broken his journey home to Hanoi from Paris with an overnight stay in Peking . After a night 's sleep , he spent the morning closeted with Chinese ' Premier Chou En-lat . Hanoi 's Ambassador in Peking , Ngo Thuyen , gave no details of the discussion when he met the press later in the day . But he scotched suggestions that the purpose of the meeting was to prepare the Chinese leader for the role of go-between during Dr. Kissinger 's four-day stay here . More than dozen meetings The envoy described President Nixon and his foreign-policy adviser as " deeply stubborn " for their refusal to accept Hanoi 's peace proposals , but said that the proper forum for any new ideas they may have is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side to resume the talks in Paris , " the envoy said . " We believe if Mr. Nixon has some new ideas , he can put them before us there . " Mr. Tho has had more than a dozen secret meetings with Dr. Kissinger in Paris during the past three years , The most recent of the meetings , just before the Moscow summit last month , failed to produce any break in the negotiating deadlock , // *Little help to Kissinger // The timing of Sunday'scmeeting with Premier Chou , coinciding as it did with the presence in Hanoi of Soviet President Podgorny , is bound to provoke speculation that there is a major breakthrough in the offing . However , there was nothing in the North Vietnamese Ambassador 's press briefing to support such speculation , and diplomats here continue to feel that Dr. Kissinger will make as little progress on Vietnam this time as he has during past Peking visits . Continued backing seen The presidential adviser , who arrived here Monday evening , is certain to discuss the war in his meetings with Mr. Chou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely find that they terrain solidly behind their Vietnamese allies , resistant to all pleas that they use their influence with Hanoi on behalf of a compromise settlement . Apart from Vietnam , Dr. Kissinger is expected to use his time here to allay any suspicions the Chinese may have about the Moscow summit , and to pursue the discussion of other Asian topici that Mr. Nixon and Mr. Chou had when they met here four months ago . Principal among such topics is the relationship between the United States and Japan , particularly in regard to U.S. efforts to have the Japanese shoulder a greater share of the collective defense burden in the western Pacific . This is seen here as a spur to reviving Japanese militarism . Sato announcement The discussion of Japan will take on renewed importance in the light of the retirement announcement made by Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato over the weekend . The Chinese have hinted on more than one occasion that a Chinese-Japanese detente , so eagerly sought by the Japanese , would have to wait until Mr. Sato stepped down . So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sato , retirement . But previous form indicates that the Chinese press will use whatever influence it has on Japanese public opinion to favor the selection as successor of a man who comes closest to meeting Peking 's prescriptions for d  --  tente between the two nations . On current form , that man would appear to be Takeo Miki , a former foreign minister . Trade and exchanges . too Also on Dr. Kissinger 's probable agenda here are bilateral topics , including trade and exchanges in the fields of sports , journalism , and learning . Although U.S. visitors continue to pour into Peking , the exchanges have not developed at the rate some people predicted after Mr. Nixon 's visit here . In fact , recent conversations between U.S. visitors and leading Chinese officials indicate that the Chinese attitude will continue to be one of caution , at least as long as the Vietnam and Taiwan problems remain unresolved . In a meeting late last week with Harvard China expert John King Fairbank , Mr. Chou expressed some interest in Mr. Fair-bank 's proposal for student exchanges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caution . In the field of journalism , the most recent indications are that it may be some time before the Chinese are ready for a permanent U.S. news bureau in Peking .
