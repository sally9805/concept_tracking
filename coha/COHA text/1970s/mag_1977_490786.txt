THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment WE 'VE just heard from a wom- an we know , who writes as follows : Because I have lived abroad for many years , I sometimes find myself a stranger in New York . The follow ing happened the afternoon of the thirty-first of December . Having bought a small turn-of-the century apothecary bottle of tender-green glass that looked as if it had been washed in by the sea , I decided to go in search of the one flower it would hold , and give both to an older woman friend as a token gift for the New Year . I walked down to the nearest florist . He is a strange man , given to ruminative black moods , and he often stands in front of his shop in clement weather and sometimes leaves his door open in the cold . His prices are so unaccountable that I seldom walk in except when he tapes a huge " SALE " sign to his window : his flag of surrender to clients , passersby , inflation ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen American Beauties . But who wants three dozen American Beauties ? I did n't . All . I wanted was one flower : a single flower among all the flowers in all the world . I looked at his display carefully , through its prison of dew-spotted sliding glass . He had long-stemmed carnations in clear-cut colors as well as the red-and-white striated hybrid . He had roses  --  tall , short in more subtle gradations . He had pale-yellow autumnal chrysanthemums the size of medium grapefruits . He had gladioli , he had pompons . He had baby 's breath , he had daisies . He had all the usual , year-round flowers . No . None of them would do . " Do you have any gardenias ? " I asked . The florist was in one of his sombre moods . " How many do you want ? " Very thin and tall , gruff , elegant in bluejeans and a sweater , he watched me , head down , eyes raised above half glasses . " One , " I said . " All sold out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want it for ? " " To put in water . I mean , to give , with an old bottle I found . " " In that case , " he stated categorically , " what you want is a gardenia with a stem . " " That 's what I said . A gardenia  --  with a stern . " He looked at me as if I had climbed out of a UFO directly onto the sidewalk in front of his shop . " My dear woman , " he half shouted , " we have not had a gardenia with a stem in this store since 1941 ! " So there he stood , among the potted palms and the ficuses , under a spread-out fern suspended from the ceiling . He stood his ground . I just stood . He calmed down . " I remember we used to sell a lot of them to Bernard Baruch , and to the President , " he said . The date 1941 , together with Bernard Baruch , told me that the President was Franklin Roosevelt , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fail , and I had , in a way , been dismissed with that date , 1941 . As I was on my way out , the florist shouted , " Hold it ! I have a friend who still carries them . Oh , he has lots of them . I 'm sure he 's got some left . " He wrote out an address on the back of one of his cards , and then raised his eyes to mine above his half glasses . The fact that he had sent me knowingly on a futile gardenia hunt became clear once I had walked more than twenty blocks and entered the second flower shop . An exceedingly polite Old World gentleman came forward to help inc . " A gardenia with a stem , " he said , with a slight trace of German accent . " We do n't carry them anymore . I 'll show you what we have . " He went to the back of the shop and returned a moment later with a gar denia in the palm of his hand , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Unfortunately , we get them this way . Made up for corsages . " He picked the flower up by what looked like its stem and turned it over in the air . " Careful , " he said , half to himself and half to me . " The flower wilts where you touch it . " What I saw were four dark gardenia leaves cut in half and arranged in a square frame around the circular flower , and a round piece of white cardboard stapled to the leaves with an opening in its center that allowed about an inch of the real stem of the flower to pass through . This blunt piece of stem almost immediately tapered off to the width of two pieces of wire , which were tightly wound together with green tape . Carefully , he turned the flower over once again , so that I could look at it , though he knew perfectly well that I was not going to buy it . It was beautiful . It was stonelike . It had the slightly yellowed tone of certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The aestivation of the petals around its heart was convoluted into the shape of a nautilus shell . The man brought it closer to my face , and I bent over to smell it . Its scent was white , too ; it was heavy but without a trace of cloying sweetness , and I realized that it had never not once  --  been successfully translated into perfume . " That 's not what you want , " the man said , and he shook his head . " It 's the same with camellias . I 'll show you . I have one left , but it 's not fresh . " He brought out the palest of pink camellias , with so many petals it must have been double . It was slightly wilted , and yellowed at the tips , but lovely nevertheless . Immediately , an unsummoned list of names ran through my head like a draft : Marie Duplessis , the angel-faced courtesan , dead of " consumption " at the age of twenty-three . She had conquered so many in that short span of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heavy debts ) , who started on a novel , " The Lady of the Camellias , " three months after her death . Published a year later , the novel was dramatized by him the year after that . Duse and Bernhardt , who played the heroine of his famous play , Marguerite Gautier , at the opposite poles of the acting range . All the movies retitled " Camille " ? inanely , ineptly , and falsely , since through all of them Marguerite remains Marguerite ( a French flower name ; Daisy , to be exact ) , and the name Camille has nothing whatever to do with the camellia flower . Garbo , at the peak of her beauty , in the George Cukor film : dressed for the theatre , bouquet of camellias in hand . I thanked the gentleman with the slight trace of German accent . He bowed lightly , and I walked out and down the avenue for three blocks ; then I came to a flower shop , and , unable to resist temptation , walked in . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to float them ? " Night fell , and I was late to visit a friend who lay in bed with a bad back . I told him my story . " I have an excellent florist you might not know about , " he said , very businesslike . He found a number . " Why do n't you call him up ? " I did . " Gardenias ? " the fourth florist said , over the telephone . " In New York , you 'll never find one with a stem . They come to us all made up , mainly from the South , or California . And it 's becoming more and more difficult to get a Belmont ' - type gardenia at all . ... Camellias ? We used to carry camellia trees , but they 're difficult to keep in city apartments . And they 're expensive to produce . You see , from the point of view of supply and demand , they just do n't pay off . I have to call twelve or fourteen greenhouses before I can get a decent camellia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get one in season , hut , of course , the flowers are small . And you 'll have to wait until Easter . " I could n't wait until Easter . I had to find my flower that afternoon . What sort of flower I bought does not matter . What does matter is that I bought a flower I did not want . And it is difficult to compromise , even with a flower , on the last afternoon of the year . ? ? Mahierites THE award season is upon us once again , and we thought you 'd like to know what the New York Mahlerites  --  a small but determined group of people devoted to advancing the study of the life and work of Gustav Mahler  --  are doing about it . On a recent evening , we joined thirty-odd Malilerites who had assembled at the New School to choose the three top Mahler recordings of 1976 . Since Maiderites are an argumentative and opinionated lot , with very high performing standards  --  most Mahlerites own extensive record collections and can readily compare several versions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informative Conductors and orchestras were evaluated with disarming frankness ( the critical test seemed to he how closely the Master 's instructions for the playing of his music were followed ) , performances were dissected , and a number of artistic reputations became slightly tarnished in the process . When we arrived at the New School , shortly before eight , we were directed to a fourth-floor lecture hall , where a mimeographed sheet handed us at the door informed us that five semifinalists had been selected by mail ballot from a total of eleven new releases listed in the Schwann catalogue . They were the Second Symphony played by the Vienna Philharmonic under Zuhin Mehta ; the Third Symphony played by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under James Levine ; the Fifth Symphony played by the Berlin Philharmonic under Herbert von Karajan ; " Das Lied von der Erde " played by the Concertgebouw Orchestra tinder Bernard Haitink , with James King and Janet Baker as soloists ; and a reissue of " Liedcr Eines Fahrenclen Geselien " played by the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra under Rafael Kubelik , with Dietrich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nialilerites  --  who ranged in . ige from twenty to sixty and had an overall scholarly look  --  were sipping cider , munching doughnuts , and chatting about you-know-who . We made our way to the cider table past fragments of enticing conversation . ( " Jimm ) ' s Eighth was adrenalin soup . All climaxes and no music . " " Zuhin should listen to Bruno Walter . Maybe he 'd learn something . " " The Philharmonic may not he the most accurate orchestra in the world , but I 'll take its tone and thrust over the more perfect Cleveland any day . " " kohl 's a great orchestra trainer but not a great symphonic con-doctor . His Mahler 's too fierce and Germanic . And the horns always look so scared . " ) After collecting a drink , we joined two men who were corn-paling notes on , the worst Mahler performances they 'd ever encountered . " My nomination is Hermann Scherclien 's Fifth with the Philadelphia , " said Jack Diether , a Mahler expert and , with a young woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He cut it to such shreds that the Scherzo and the Finale together took about the same length of time as the Adagietto , which was played agonizingly slowly . " " Stokowski cut out one movement of the Second out of town , " said his companion , " and omitted a different one when he got to New York . " " The second-worst performance , " continued Mr. Diether , " was Skrowaczewski 's Klagende Lied ' with the Minnesota . In the first part , he cut the orchestral interludes wherever he could find five to twenty bars that did n't change key . And in the third part the offstage orchestra sections had had to be cut , for financial reasons . It was horrifying . " We asked Mr. Diether what major pitfalls await a Mahler conductor . " The music is tough to handle , technically and emotionally , " he said " It has very abrupt and complex dynamics , and it is also very subtle . So you need an orchestral technician and an intellectual who has tremendous feeling for Mahler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philharmonic in the fifties , was the greatest Mahler conductor of his day , because he could project Mahler 's ideas and emotions and also had the technical skill to handle the tricky changes of mood without losing the architectural line of the score . " " Who is the best Mahler conductor today ? " we asked . " There is n't one , " replied Mr. Diether . " There are only specific performances . Bernstein 's Tenth Adagio . Solti 's Fifth . James Conlon 's Sixth . " We moved on to another group , which was discussing Pierre Boulez and James Levine , two conductors who had participated in the New York Philharmonic 's recent Mahler cycle . " When Boulez played the Seventh in 1975 , it was as if he were launching a battleship that promptly sank , " said a short , somewhat bald man wearing black-rimmed glasses . " This time , it floated . The orchestra still does n't agree with his conception , but at least it knows how to play it . " " Boulez has a fantastic ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said a young woman with black curly hair . " And he brings out a lot of things that other conductors ignore . He did a beautiful job of controlling the tension at the end of the Third . " " But Levine has more absolute control over the orchestra , " said the man with glasses . " Unfortunately , " the girl replied , with a smile . " The Philharmonic played exactly what Levine wanted . Which simply demonstrated that lie does n't have genuine tempo relationships . Andante to allegro ca n't he that far apart in terms of logic . " A few minutes later , Nancy Karlins called the meeting to order and led off with several announcements . A sculptor was offering his Mahler plaque to members at a discount . A concert of youthful Mahler lieder was being planned for next season . A researcher had uncovered the recipe for Mahler 's favorite Apfelkuchen , and copies were available . Another Mahlerite had acquired photographs of two steamships on which Mahler had crossed the Atlantic , and was displaying them at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviews with musicians who had actually played under the composer had been made by a California Mahlerite and would be presented at the next meeting . Then the group got down to the serious business of selecting the award winners . As excerpts from each of the five entries were played , the reactions in the room ranged from pleasure to pain . Levine 's recently issued Third Symphony evoked knowing smiles . ( " Much more subtle and aware than his live performances with the Philharmonic , " a man behind us said . ) Karajan 's Fifth produced pleased surprise . ( " He 's come to Mahler very late , but he really understands what it 's about , " remarked a woman to our left . ) But a Karajan " Lied von der Erde " with the same orchestra had not even made the semifinals . Haitink 's " Lied von der Erde " aroused mixed enthusiasm . ( " That 's the most Chinese singing I 've ever heard , " said a young man with a black beard . ) The big hit was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recording that sent the Mahlerites into ecstasies . ( " Stupendous ! " we heard . And " Kubelik is one of the unsung giants of our time . " And " It 's a performance that is slow enough to get at the detail without losing the momentum . " ) The big flop was Mehta 's Second Symphony , which was dismissed as insensitive and superficial . ( " He pushes the tempo , and he has about as much grace and poise as an elephant , " said one Mahlerite near us . " It was n't warm , relaxed , and comfortable , " said a second . " Thai 's the Vienna Philharmonic ? " said a third . ) When the official vote was taken , the first choice was the " Fahrenden Gesellen " reissue , with Levine 's Third and Karajan 's Fifth coming in second and third . " This seems to indicate , " said Mr. Diether mildly , " that the record companies are turning out a lot of things we think are n't very good . " On our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain the sudden surge of interest in Mahler . " I think it 's because he relates to the uncertainty in which we live at present , " lie replied . " Mahler questioned the basis of our existence , and expresses his doubts and his convictions in his music . And people  --  especially the young  --  who have to face existential issues today respond to this . Forty years ago , Mahler was too much for many people to handle , because they did n't want to think about ultimate responsibilities . Now that we are forced to contemplate such things , he 's a lot easier to understand . " Palme OLOF PALME , who will be fifty years old this month , has inhabited the higher reaches of Swedish politics for exactly half his life  --  since 1952 , whcn he was elected chairman of the National Union of Swedish Students . Some years before , he had hitchhiked around the United States , and had studied politics and economics at Kenyon College . In 1954 , Prime Minister Tage Erlander decided that here was a bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast differences in personal style  --  Erlander is twinkly , fatherly , and folksy , whereas Palme , who is of aristocratic origins , is as cosmopolitan as they come  --  the two men worked together splendidly , and in 1969 Palme succeeded his mentor in the Premiership . The Swedes had a general election last September 20th , and Paline 's party , the Social Democrats , lost to a coalition of Liberals , Moderates , and Centrists . Forty-four years of Social Democratic rule was thus ended  --  or , as Palme prefers to think of it , interrupted . There will be another election in 1979 . In any case , given Sweden 's stability and the notorious longevity of its citizens , Palme will most likely still be playing a big role in his country 's affairs at the turn of the next century . Palme was in New York last month , after stopovers in Geneva , where he was elected a vice-president of the Socialist International , and in Barcelona , where he got a tumultuous welcome at the first legal congress of the Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1932 . Here in town , among other activities , he gave a talk at the School of International Affairs of Columbia University . In the Dag Hammarskjiild Faculty Lounge , a couple of hundred people , mostly graduate students , crowded the chairs , tables , and rugs . They gave Palme a big hand . He had opposed the Vietnam war as passionately as if he were an American , and that had earned hini the respect of many people now of graduate-school age . Besides , Palme , Kenyon ' 48 , has always felt at home on American campuses . His face is deeply lined , and his eyes are deep-set to the point of hollowness , but he has sandy hair , a slim build , and an intense manner , which give him the air of a much younger man . He spoke informally , without notes , in excellent , lightly accented English , and here is sonic of what he said : " In general , Democratic Socialism is moving ahead in Europe . This is notwithstanding the fact that we lost an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost by a very narrow margin , and largely because the opposition , in the final weeks of the campaign , attacked us from both the left and the right on nuclear energy . Since then , they have adopted our program , and I do n't know whether to congratulate them on their wisdom or scold them for turning their backs on those who voted for them . Since the election , we have got twenty-five thousand new members , and we are well ahead in the opinion polls . Overall , again we are gaining strength . In 1955 , thirty-three per cent of all Cabinet members in Western Europe were Social Democrats . By 1975 , the figure was up to fifty-four per cent , while Christian Democrats , liberals , and conservatives had lost accordingly . There 's the same tendency in members of parliaments , votes at elections , and so forth . Why is this so ? Well , capitalism in the Western world  --  industrial society in the Western world  --  is in crisis . When you ca n't solve the problem of employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are now very few defenders of the basic ideas of capitalism  --  of the ownership and control of the economy in the hands of a very few people . On the other hand , Communism , as such , has lost much of its glory . The stale bureaucracies of Eastern Europe , with their dogmatic and monolithic thinking , do n't stir people 's imagination . So Democratic Socialism has become more of an attractive alternative . " During the sixties  --  the golden sixties when we had high growth in most industrial countries , our task was simple and dear . The main problem was the imbalance between a flourishing private sector and a poor public sector and it was only through the public sector that people 's longing for better education , housing , and health care could he satisfied . This was the core of Democratic Socialist ideology in the sixties , and it was quite successful in a number of countries . Now , in the seventies , we have a host of new problems . Growth is no longer automatic . We thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live through a period of mass unemployment  --  the worst since the Great Depression . So if you look at Democratic Socialist thinking in Europe  --  in my country , and , increasingly , in others  --  it starts with a concept of work : not as the sociologists of the fifties saw it , as a necessary evil from which to escape to leisure time , where the important things in life took place , but as a part of being human . If you 're unemployed , or if your work is grim or terrible or hazardous , that will color the rest of your existence . We see unemployment not only as a gross economic waste but also as an individual human tragedy , because it deprives one of a meaningful social role . And if there is anything that is characteristic of Swedish society it is work . Even ( luring this time of great international crisis , the last figure for unemployment in our country was one and six-tenths per cent . Below that it 's difficult to grt , because you always have people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the welfare society we have tried to build in Scandinavia and the conditions of existence of people at work , simply because working conditions are steered by the profit motive , by and large , and people who work are a unit of production . You 're taught in school about democracy  --  that you should be able to influence " The question before the board , then , is whether or not to enter an altered state of consciousness . " events in your surroundings -- but in most industrial countries the moment you enter industry you enter an eighteenth-century hierarchical structure . So one of the main thrusts of Democratic Socialism now is to build up participation at work , whether it be in industry or in the public sector , and that means a transfer of power from capital to work . We long ago left the old idea that the nationalization of the means of production will solve our problems . On the other hand , there are a lot of things that you can not solve by the market mechanism , by the profit motive , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning instead . The core of the energy problem , for example , is to bring down the use of energy , and that can he done only by very determined long-range planning . It 's the same with the use of natural resources , or regional development , or full employment . These things are too important to he left to market forces . They have to he done by democratic planning  --  and not by a few bureaucrats but under popular control . " We speak in our country of three aspects of Socialism . One is democracy , which itself develops in three stages . The first , which our predecessors fought for , is political democracy  --  the right to vote , freedom of speech and the press , free trade unions . NVe continue with social democracy  --  fighting mass unemployment and poverty , creating sickness insurance . We started that phase in the thirties . The third stage would he economic democracy , which means not leaving the economy to the market forces and the profit motive but putting it under the control of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual factories . " Another aspect of Democratic Socialism is solidarity as a basic value of society . If you build a society on the notion of competition  --  of everybody working his own way at the expense of everybody else you will fragment society and inevitably create great social in justice . Classical liberalism is a very cold ideology , because its starting point is people 's loneliness . Socialism , without denying the loneliness that is built into the human condition , seeks instead to develop our sense of community and human solidarity . " The third aspect is internationalism . I have the firm conviction that any nation 's external policy is an extension of its internal policy . You ca n't work for ideas of solidarity and justice and greater equality on the international scene if you 're not prepared to pursue the same goals in your own country . " Then Palme took questions , and someone asked if he thought that countries much larger than Sweden could achieve comparably low rates of unemployment . " Yes , if they have a determined policy ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous productive capacity of the United Status has no need for unemployment . I 'm not criticizing anything in this country , but if you look at your hospital system or your day-care system or your educational system , I would imagine that the number of job opportunities measured by the needs of people is rather significant , and if that expansion took place it would probably take care of much of the unemployment problem . Then , people say two things . They are seared of inflation . But that 's a matter of consumer-demand policy . And , secondly , people are afraid of high taxes . But that you get accustomed to . " The audience laughed , and someone asked Palme to comment on the emergence of " Eurocommunism . " " The Communists in Europe , especially Southern Europe , have been in isolation ever since the war  --  which means that large parts of the working class of Southern Europe have been deprived of any political influence , " he said . " Now the Communists in these countries are trying to break out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they give up certain dogmatic elements of Stalinism and Leninism  --  the dictatorship of the proletariat , proletarian internationalism , and democratic centralism . The first means , simply , dictatorship . The second means that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union should he decisive in internation , t1 matters . The third means an elitist construction of the Party , . If they give up all that , we could n't , as Willy Brandt has put it , he insensitive to that development . If it goes all the way , they 'll become good Democratic Socialists . They 're not there yet . We 'll have to see . "
