Some time during this Christmas season , a father selecting a suit for his son or a sugar daddy eying a bauble for his woman friend will pull out a plastic credit card to pay for it , and the U.S. consumer will be $1 trillion in debt . Figuring that in an inflationary period the wise person borrows while the fool saves , the consumer has been piling on debt at a quickening rate , buying new houses , new toys and just about everything else . Private debt now averages more than $4,600 for each man , woman and child in the U.S. <P> Federal Reserve Board Chairman William Miller frets that the load is too heavy . So does his predecessor , Arthur Burns . Says he : " Consumers are going into debt at a reckless rate . They are counting on good luck . Let there be some weakness in the economy , and they 'll be in trouble . " <P> Retail sales were up a strong 2% in November on top of October 's 1.3% rise , and the consumer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat in many Midwest areas , but in Boston , Pittsburgh , Atlanta , Dallas , Houston and Beverly Hills , retailers report sales well ahead of last year . Some are even looking forward to double-digit Increases . <P> Dallas merchants say Christmas sales may climb by 25% . Shoppers are packing malls in suburban Houston to buy stereos , TVs and Betamax recorders . Expensive furs , jewelry , silks and cashmeres are brisk sellers everywhere . Many retailers echo the report of a luggage salesman at Chicago 's Marshall Field department store : " Customers are buying better quality . It 's the old philosophy of being too poor to buy cheap . " <P> Consumer debt , the kind that results from credit-card purchases , installment buying and other small loans , has jumped since 1975 , from $197 billion to $289 billion . Moreover , mortgage debt in the same period has risen from $479 billion to $701 billion because home prices have increased fast and people figure that houses are a good investment . <P> There is a buy-now attitude among Americans , who figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they see something they like , they had better buy it now . Economist Alan Greenspan estimates that an unprecedented 25% of the average household 's after-tax income now goes to meeting interest and principal payments each month , and that " there are a significant number of households that allocate 40% or more of their income to debt service . " <P> While they spend , borrow and pay off , Americans are saving less of their incomes than in a decade-only 5.1% , which is down from the 1973-75 average of 7.6% . This may be due in part to a feeling that people need not worry about their old age because Medicare , Social Security and private pensions will take care of them , but the attitude represents a basic change in consumer psychology . When inflation ran high in past years , consumers reduced their borrowing and increased their savings out of fear of bad times ahead . This helped fight inflation by braking an economy that needed slowing . <P> What makes the present load bearable for the borrower is the lengthening of the repayment schedules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for three years can now be stretched to four or even five . Some credit-card repayments can be drawn out indefinitely for anyone who is willing to pay an annual finance charge of up to 18%.
