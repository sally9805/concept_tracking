G.O.P. government in exile <P> Ever since New Deal days , the Brookings Institution has wielded immense influence in Washington 's corridors of power as the nation 's pre-eminent liberal think tank-to the discomfort of conservatives who respected its solidly researched studies of wide-ranging economic issues enough to wish that their side could produce equally good ones . Now it can , through the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research . The Washington-based A.E.I. , founded back in 1943 , long languished in obscurity , but during the 1970s it has steadily gained enough intellectual weight to become a sort of Republican Brookings . <P> A.E.I. 's influence , ironically , is being magnified by the G.O.P. 's defeat in last year 's presidential election . Out-of-office Republicans have been flocking to A.E.I. in such numbers that , echoing a joke often made about Brookings during the Nixon-Ford years , the institute could be described as almost a Republican government in exile . Unlike Brookings , where most appointments are full time , A.E.I. has only a small core of a dozen program directors and six resident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prestigious group of outside consultants and experts . Paul W. McCracken , once chairman of President Nixon 's Council of Economic Advisers , serves part time as head of A.E.I. 's " council of academic advisers " and plays a leading role in choosing what subjects the institute will study and who will investigate them . Others helping A.E.I. on a part-time basis to build up expertise include two leaders of the Nixon Cabinet : Melvin Laird , former Secretary of Defense , who has just finished an A.E.I. report on energy problems , and William Simon , Secretary of the Treasury until last January , who is starting an A.E.I. study of tax policy . <P> Then , in addition to a permanent staff and the part-timers , there is a category of " senior fellows , " who often undertake research projects . Among the senior fellows are Laurence Silberman , a former Deputy Attorney General ; John Robson , former chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board ; and-oh , yes-one Gerald R. Ford , the institute 's only " distinguished fellow . " The former President , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year from A.E.I. , will participate in seminars or conferences at ten colleges and universities this fall under A.E.I. auspices . For further prestige , A.E.I. can boast the consulting services of Academic Adviser Milton Friedman , winner of the 1976 Nobel Prize in Economics , and Senior Fellows Irving Kristol , Henry Luce Professor of Urban Values at N.Y.U. , and Ben Wallenberg , the conservative Democratic election analyst .
