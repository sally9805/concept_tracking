 | French . There were two words Tom did n't know . He would look them up tonight in his Harrap 's beside his bed . He was good at holding words in his memory to look up . After dinner he put on a raincoat , though it was n't raining , and walked to a little bar-cafe a quarter of a mile distant . Here he took coffee some evenings , standing at the bar . Invariably the proprietor Georges inquired about Mme. Heloise , and expressed regret that Tom had to spend so much time alone . Tonight Tom said cheerfully : " Oh , I am not sure she will stay on that yacht another two months . She will get bored . " " Quel luxe , " murmured Georges dreamily . He was a paunchy man with a round face . Tom mistrusted his mild and unfailing good humor . His wife Marie , a big energetic brunette who wore bright red lipstick , was frankly tough , but she had a wild happy way of laughing that redeemed her . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object to that fact , but it was not his favorite bar . It just happened to be the closest . At least Georges and Marie had never referred to Dickie Greenleaf . A few people in Paris , acquaintances of his or Heloise 's , had , and so had the owner of the Hotel St. Pierre , Villeperce 's only hostelry . The owner had asked , " You are perhaps the M. Ripley who was a friend of the American Granelafe ? " Tom had acknowledged that he was . But that had been five years ago , and such a question  --  if it never went any further  --  did not make Tom nervous , but he preferred to avoid the subject . The newspapers had said that he had received quite a sum of money , some said a regular income , which was true , from Dickie 's will . At least no newspaper had ever implied that Tom had written the will himself , which he had . The French always remembered financial details . After his coffee , Tom walked home , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road , slipping now and then in the sodden leaves that cluttered the edge of the road . There was no sidewalk to mention . He had brought a flashlight , because the streetlights were too infrequent . He caught glimpses of cosy families in kitchens , watching television , sitting around oilclothcovered tables . Chained dogs barked in a few courtyards . Then he opened the iron gates  --  ten feet high  --  of his own  | house , and his shoes crunched on gravel . Mme. Annette 's light was on in her side room , Tom saw from the glow . She had her own television set . Often Tom painted at night , for his amusement only . He knew he was a bad painter , worse than Dickie . But tonight he was not in the mood . Instead , he wrote to a friend in Hamburg , Reeves Minot , an American , asking when did he expect to need him ? Reeves was to plant a microfilm ? or something  --  on a certain Italian Count Bertolozzi . The Count would then visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom would remove the object from the place in the suitcase or wherever , which Reeves would tell him and post it to a man Tom did n't know at all in Paris . Tom frequently performed these fencelike services , sometimes for jewelry thefts . It was easier if Tom removed the objects from his guests , than if someone tried to do the same thing in a Paris hotel room , when the carrier was not in . Tom knew Count Bertolozzi slightly from a recent trip to Milan , when Reeves , who lived in Hamburg , had been in Milan also . Tom had discussed paintings with the Count . It was usually easy for Tom to persuade people with a bit of leisure to stay with him a day or so in Villeperce and look at his paintings  --  he had besides Derwatts , a Soutine , of whose work Tom was especially fond , a Van Gogh , two Magrittes , and drawings by Cocteau and Picasso , and many drawings of less famous painters which he thought equally good or better . Villeperce was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enjoy a bit of country before going up . In fact , Tom often fetched them from Orly in his car , Villeperce being some forty miles south of Orly . Only once had Tom failed , when an American guest had become immediately ill in Tom 's house from something he must have eaten before arriving , and Tom had not been able to get to his suitcase because the guest was constantly in bed and awake in his room . That object  --  another microfilmed thing of some sort  --  had been recovered with difficulty by a Reeves man in Paris . Tom could not understand the value of some of these things , but neither could he always when he read spy novels , and Reeves was only a fence himself and took a percentage . Tom always drove to another town to post these things , and he always sent them a false return name and address . . u '  | That night , Tom could not fall asleep , so he got out of bed , put on his purple woolen dressing gown  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a birthday present from Heloiseand went down to the kitchen . He had thought of taking up a bottle of Super Valstar beer , but decided to make some tea . He almost never drank tea , so in a way it was appropriate , as he felt it was a strange night . He tiptoed around the kitchen , so as not to awaken Mme. Annette . The tea Tom made was dark red . He had put too much in the pot , and it was what the English would call filthy tea . He carried a tray into the living room , poured a cup , and walked about , noiseless in sealskin houseshoes . Why not impersonate Derwatt , he thought . My God ; yes ! That was the solution , the perfect solution , and the only solution . Derwatt was about his age , close enough  --  Tom was thirtyone and Derwatt would be about thirty-five . Blue-gray eyes , Tom remembered Cynthia ( Bernard 's girl friend ) or maybe Bernard saying in one of their gushing descriptions of Derwatt the Untarnishable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tremendous help , would be , for Tom . Jeff Constant would surely be pleased with the idea . A press interview . Tom must brush up on the questions he might have to answer , and the stories he would have to tell . Was Derwatt as tall as he ? Well , who among the press would know ? Derwatt 's hair had been darker , Tom thought . But that could be fixed . Tom drank more tea . He continued walking about the room . His should be a surprise appearance , a surprise presumably even to Jeff and Ed  --  and Bernard , of course . Or so they would tell the press . Tom tried to imagine confronting Mr. Thomas Murchison . Be calm , self-assured , that was the essence . If Derwatt said a picture was his own , that he had painted it , who was Murchison to say him nay ? On a crest of enthusiasm , Tom went to his telephone . Often the operators were asleep at this hour  --  r A.M. and a bit after ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the yellow sofa . He was thinking that Jeff or somebody would have to get some very good make-up in readiness . Tom wished he could count on a girl , Cynthia for instance , to  | supervise it , but Cynthia and Bernard had broken up two or  | three years ago , Tom thought . Cynthia knew the score about Derwatt and Bernard 's forgeries , and would have none of it , not a penny of the profits , Tom remembered . " ' Allo , j'ecoute , " said the female operator in an annoyed tone , as if Tom had got her out of bed to do him a favor . Tom gave the number of Jeff 's studio , which he had in an address book by the telephone . Tom was rather lucky , and the call came through in five minutes . He pulled his third cup of filthy tea nearer the telephone . " Hello , Jeff . Tom . How are things ? " " Not any better . Ed 's here . We were just thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , and I have a better idea . How about my playing ? our missing friend  --  for a few hours , anyway ? " Jeff took an instant to comprehend . " Oh , Tom , great ! Can you be here for Wednesday ? " " Yes , sure . " " Can you make it Tuesday ? Tomorrow ? " " I do n't think I can tomorrow . But Wednesday , yes . Now listen , Jeff , the make-up  --  it 's got to be good . " " Do n't worry ! Just a sec ! " He left off to speak with Ed , then returned . " Ed says he has a source  --  of supply . " " Do n't announce it to the public , " Tom continued in his calm voice , because Jeff sounded as if he were leaping off his feet with joy . " And another thing , if it does n't work , if I fail ? we must say it 's a joke a friend of yours dreamed up  --  me . That it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom meant with validating Murchison 's forgery , but Jeff grasped this at once . " Ed wants to say a word . " " Hello , Tom , " Ed 's deeper voice said . " We 're delighted you 're coming over . It 's a marvelous idea . And you know  - -  Bernard 's got some of his clothes and things . " " I 'll leave that to you . " Tom felt suddenly alarmed . " The clothes are the least . It 's the face . Get cracking , will you ? " " Right you are . Bless you . " They hung up . Then Tom slumped back on the sofa and relaxed , almost horizontal . No , he would n't go to London tomorrow . Go on stage at the last moment , with dash and  | momentum . Too much briefing and rehearsal could be a bad thing . Tom got up with the cold cup of tea . It would be amusing and funny if he could bring it off , he thought as he stared at the Derwatt over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in a chair , a man with several outlines , so it seemed one was looking at the picture through someone else 's distorting eyeglasses . Some people said Derwatts hurt their eyes . But from a distance of three or four yards , they did n't . This was not a genuine Derwatt , but an early Bernard Tufts forgery . Across the room hung a genuine Derwatt , The Red Chairs . Two little girls sat side by side , looking terrified , as if it were their first day in school , or as if they were listening to something frightening in church . The Red Chairs was six or seven years old . Behind the little girls , wherever they were sitting , the whole place was on fire . Yellow and red flames leaped about , hazed by touches of white , so that the fire did n't immediately catch the attention of the beholder . But when it did , the emotional effect was shattering . Tom loved both pictures . By now he had almost forgot to remember , when he looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine . Tom recalled the early amorphous days of what was now Derwatt , Ltd . Tom had met Jeffrey Constant and Bernard Tufts in London just after Derwatt had drowned  --  presumably intentionally  --  in Greece , and shortly after Tom had returned from Greece himself , not long after Dickie Greenleaf 's death . Derwatt 's body had never been found , but some fishermen of the village said they had seen him go swimming one morning , and had not seen him return . Derwatt 's friends  --  and Tom had met Cynthia Gradnor on the same visit  --  had been profoundly disturbed , affected in a way that Tom had never seen after a death , not even in a family . Jeff , Ed , Cynthia , Bernard had been dazed . They had spoken dreamily , passionately , of Derwatt not only as an artist but as a friend , and as a human being . He had lived simply , eating badly at times , but he had always been generous to others . Children in his neighborhood had adored him , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had always reached in his pockets for what were perhaps his last pennies to give them . Then just  | before he had gone to Greece , Derwatt had had a disappointment . He had painted a mural on a government assignment for a post office in a town in the north of England . It had been approved in sketch form , but rejected when finished : somebody was nude in it , or too nude , and Derwatt had refused to change it . ( " And he was right , of course ! " Derwatt 's loyal friends had assured Tom . ) But this had cut Derwatt out of a thousand pounds that he had counted on . It seemed to have been a last straw in a series of disappointments  --  the depth of which Derwatt 's friends had not realized , and for this they reproached themselves . There had been a woman in the picture too , Tom recalled vaguely , the cause of another disappointment to Derwatt , but it seemed that the woman was not so important to him as his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly free lance , and were quite busy , and in the last days when Derwatt had called on them  --  not for money but for company on several evenings ? they had said they had n't time to see him . Unbeknownst to his friends , Derwatt had sold what furniture he had in his Islington studio and got himself to Greece where he had written a long and depressed letter to Bernard . ( Tom had never seen the letter . ) Then had come the news of his disappearance or death . The first thing Derwatt 's friends , including Cynthia , had done was gather all his paintings and drawings and try to sell them . They had wanted to keep his name alive , had wanted the world to know and appreciate what he had done . Derwatt had had no relatives , and as Tom recalled , he had been a foundling without even known parents . The legend of his tragic death had helped instead of hindered ; usually galleries were uninterested in paintings by a young and unknown artist who was already dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used his entrees and his talent for articles on Derwatt in newspapers , color supplements and art magazines , and Jeffrey Constant had made photographs of Derwatt 's paintings to illustrate them . Within a few months of Derwatt 's death they found a gallery , the Buckmaster Gallery and moreover in Bond Street , and soon Derwatt 's canvases were selling for two and three hundred pounds . Then had come the inevitable . The paintings were all sold ,  | or nearly , and this was when Tom had been living in London ( he had lived for two years in a flat in S VV z near Eaton Square ) and had run into Jeff and Ed and Bernard one night in the Salisbury pub . They had again been sad , because Derwatt 's paintings were coming to an end , and it had been Tom who had said , " You 're doing so well , it 's a shame to end like this . Ca n't Bernard knock off a few paintings in Derwatt 's style ? " Tom had meant it as a joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only knew that Bernard was a painter . But Jeff , a practical type like Ed Banbury ( and not a bit like Bernard ) had turned to Bernard and said , " I 've thought of that , too . What do you think , Bernard ? " Tom had forgot Bernard 's exact reply , but he remembered that Bernard had lowered his head as if in shame or plain terror at the idea of falsifying his idol Derwatt . Months later , Tom had encountered Ed Banbury in a street in London , and Ed had said cheerfully that Bernard had brought off two excellent " Derwatts " and they had sold one at the Buckmaster as a genuine . Then still later , just after Tom had married Heloise , and was no longer living in London , Tom , Heloise , and Jeff were at the same party , a large cocktail party of the kind where you never meet or even see the host , and Jeff had beckoned Tom into a corner . Jeff had said , " Can we meet somewhere later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card . " Can you come over around eleven tonight ? " So Tom had gone to Jeff 's alone , which had been simple , because Heloise  --  who at that time did not speak much English ? had had enough after the cocktail party , and wanted to go back to their hotel . Heloise loved London  --  English sweaters and Carnaby Street , and the shops that sold Union Jack wastebaskets and signs that said things like " Piss off , " things that Tom often had to translate for her , but she said her head ached after trying to speak English for an hour . " Our problem is , " Jeff had said that night , " we ca n't go on pretending we 've found another Derwatt somewhere . Bernard is doing fine but ? Do you think we could dare dig up a big trove of Derwatt 's somewhere , like Ireland where he painted for a bit , and sell them and then call it quits ? Bernard  | is n't keen about going on . He feels he 's betraying Derwattin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then said , " What 's the matter with Derwatt being still alive somewhere ? A recluse somewhere , sending his paintings to London ? That is , if Bernard can keep going . " Um-m . Well  --  yes . Greece , maybe . What a super idea , Tom ! It can go on forever ! " " How about Mexico ? I think it 's safer than Greece . Let 's say Derwatt 's living in some little village . He wo n't tell anyone the name of the village  --  except maybe you and Ed and Cynthia ? " " Not Cynthia . She 's ? Well , Bernard does n't see much of her any more . Consequently neither do we . Just as well she does n't know too much about this . " Jeff had rung up Ed that night to tell him the idea , Tom recalled . " It 's just an idea , " Tom had said . " I do n't know if it 'll work . " But it had worked . Derwatt 's paintings had begun coming from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Derwatt 's " resurrection " had been exploited to advantage by Ed Banbury and Jeff Constant in more magazine articles , with photographs of Derwatt and his ( Bernard 's ) latest paintings , though not of Derwatt himself in Mexico , because Derwatt permitted no interviewers or photographers . The paintings were sent from Vera Cruz and not even Jeff or Ed knew the name of his village . Derwatt was perhaps mentally sick to be such a recluse . His paintings were sick and depressed , according to some critics . They were still among the highest priced paintings of any living artist in England or on the Continent or in America . Ed Banbury wrote to Tom in France , offering him ten per cent of the profits , the loyal little group ( now numbering only three , Bernard , Jeff , and Ed ) being the sole beneficiaries of Derwatt 's sales . Tom had accepted , mainly because he considered it , his acceptance , rather a guarantee of his silence about the duplicity . And Bernard Tufts was painting like a demon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure if Bernard owned any part of it . Several Derwatts were in a permanent collection of the gallery , and the gallery showed  | the paintings of other artists as well , of course . This was more Jeff 's job than Ed 's , and Jeff had hired an assistant , a sort of manager for the gallery . But this step up , the purchase of the Buckmaster Gallery , had come after Jeff and Ed had been approached by an art materials manufacturer called George Janopolos or some such , who wanted to start a line of goods to be labeled " Derwatt , " which would include everything from erasers to oil paint sets , and for which he offered Derwatt a royalty of one per cent . Ed and Jeff had decided to accept for Derwatt ( presumably with Derwatt 's consent ) . A company had then been formed called Derwatt , Ltd . All this Tom recollected at 4 in the morning , shivering a little despite his princely dressing gown . Mme. Annette always thriftily turned the central heating down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between his hands and stared unseeing at a photograph of Heloise  --  long blond hair on either side of a slender face , a pleasant and meaningless design to Tom just now rather than a face  --  and he thought of Bernard working in secret on his Derwatt forgeries in a closed , even locked room in his studio apartment . Bernard 's place was pretty crummy , as it always had been . Tom had never seen the sanctum sanctorum where he painted his masterpieces , the Derwatts that brought in hundreds of quid . If one painted more forgeries than one 's own paintings , would n't the forgeries become more natural , more real , more genuine to oneself , even , than one 's own painting ? Would n't the effort finally go out of it and the work become second nature ? At last Tom curled up on the yellow sofa , slippers off and feet drawn under his robe , and slept . He did not sleep long before Mme. Annette arrived and awakened him with a shriek , or a shrill gasp , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tom said , smiling , sitting up . Annette hurried off to make his coffee .  | Tom booked a flight to London at noon on Wednesday . It would give him only a couple of hours to get made-up and to be briefed . Not enough time to grow nervous . Tom drove to Melun to pick up some cash  --  francs  --  at his bank . It was twenty to i 2 , and the bank closed at i 2 . Torn was third on the queue at the window where people received cash , but unfortunately a woman was delivering payroll money or some such at this window , heaving up bags of coins , while keeping her feet braced against the bags that remained on the floor . Behind the grill , a clerk with wetted thumb was counting stacks of banknotes as quickly as possible and making notations of their sums on two separate papers . How long would this go on , Tom wondered , as the clock crept toward ' 2 . Tom watched with amusement as the queue broke up . Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring glassy-eyed , like fascinated snakes , at all the dough , as if it were a heritage left them by a relative who had worked a lifetime for it . Tom gave it up and left the bank . He could manage without the cash , he thought , and in fact he had only been thinking of giving it or selling it to English friends who might be coming to France . On Wednesday morning , when Tom was packing his bag ,  | Mme. Annette knocked on his bedroom door . " I 'm off for Munich , " Tom said cheerily . " There 's a concert . " " Ah , Muniche ! Bavarie ! You must take warm clothing . " Mme. Annette was used to his impromptu trips . " For how long , M. Tome ? " " Two days , maybe three . Do n't worry about messages . I may ring to see if any has come . " Then Tom thought of something possibly useful , a Mexican ring that he had  --  he thought  --  in his studbox . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttons , a heavy ring of silver whose design was two coiled snakes . Tom disliked it and had forgot how he acquired it , but at least it was Mexican . Tom blew on it , rubbed it against a trousers leg , and pocketed it . The post at io:30 A.M. brought three items , a telephone bill , lumpy in its envelope because of separate tabs for each nonVilleperce call ; a letter from Heloise ; and an American airmail letter addressed in a hand Tom did n't know . He turned the envelope over and was surprised to see the name Christopher Greenleaf on the back with a San Francisco return address . Who was Christopher ? He opened Heloise 's letter first . Cheri , I am happy and very quite now . Very good repastes . We catch fishs off the boat . Zeppo sends love . Zeppo was her swarthy Greek host and Tom could tell him what to do with his love . I learn better to mount a bicycle . We have made many voyages into the land which is dry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I miss you . Are you happy ? Many invites ? Did that mean guests or invitations ? Are you painting ? I have received no word from Papa . Kiss Mme. A. I embrace you . The rest was in French . She wanted him to send a red bathing suit which he would find in the small commode in her bathroom . He should send it airmail . The yacht had a heated swimming pool . Tom at once went upstairs where Mme. An-  | nette was still working in his room , and entrusted this task to her , giving her a hundred-franc bill for it , because he thought she might be scandalized at the price of the airmail package and be tempted to send it slow post . Then he went down and opened the Greenleaf letter hastily , because he had to leave for Orly in a few minutes . Oct. 13 , 19 Dear Mr. Ripley , I am a cousin of Dickie 's and am coming to Europe next week , probably going to London first , though I can not make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway , I thought it would be nice if we could meet . My uncle Herbert gave me your address , and he says you are not far from Paris . Have n't got your telephone number , but I can look it up . To tell you a bit about myself , I am twenty and I go to Stanford University . I spent one year in military service , during which my college was interrupted . I 'll return to Stanford for a degree in engineering but meanwhile I am taking a year off to see Europe and relax . Lots of fellows do this now . The pressure everywhere is quite something . I mean in America , but maybe you have been in Europe so long you do n't know what I mean . My uncle has told me a lot about you . He says you were a good friend of Dickie 's . I met Dickie when I was II and he was 21 . I remember a tall blond fellow . He visited my family in California . Please tell me if you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile here 's hoping to meet you . Sincerely Chris Greenleaf He would get out of that one politely , Tom thought . No use making closer contact with the Greenleaf family . Once in a blue moon Herbert Greenleaf wrote him , and Tom always replied , nice polite letters . " Mme. Annette , keep the home fires burning , " Tom said as he took off .  | " What did you say ? " He translated it into French as best he could . " Au revoir , M. Tome ! Bon voyage ! " Mme. Annette waved to him from the front door . Tom took the red Alfa-Romeo , one of the two cars in the garage . At Orly , he put the car in the indoor garage , saying it was for two or three days . He bought a bottle of whisky in the terminus to take to the gang . He had already a big bottle of Pernod in his suitcase ( since he was permitted to enter London with only one bottle ) , because Tom had found that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle , the inspector never asked him to open his suitcase . On the plane he bought untipped Gauloises , always popular in London . It was raining lightly in England . The bus crept along on the left side of the road , past the family houses whose names always amused Tom , though now he could hardly read them through the murk . Bide-a-Wee . Unbelievable . Milford Haven . Dun Wandering . They hung on little shingles . Inglenook . SitYe-boon . Good God . Then came the stretch of jammed-together Victorian houses that had been converted into small hotels with grandiose names in neon lights between Doric doorway pillars : Manchester Arms , King Alfred , Cheshire House . Tom knew that behind the genteel respectablility of those narrow lobbies some of the best murderers of the present day took refuge for a night or so , looking equally respectable themselves . England was England , God bless it ! The next thing that caught Tom 's attention was a poster on a lamppost on the left side of the road . DERWATT was written in bold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture reproduced in color looked , in the dim light , dark purple or black and somewhat resembled the raised top of a grand piano . A new Bernard Tufts forgery , doubtless . There was another such poster a few yards on . It was odd to feel so " announced " all over London , and to arrive so quietly , Tom thought as he stepped down from the bus at the West Kensington Terminus unnoticed by anyone . From the terminus , Tom rang Jeff Constant at his studio . Ed Banbury answered .  | " Hop a taxi and come straight here ! " Ed said , sounding wildly happy . Jeff 's studio was in St. John 's Wood . Second floor  --  first to the English  --  on the left . It was a proper neat little building , neither swank nor shabby . Ed whipped the door open . " My God , Tom , it 's great to see you ! " They shook hands firmly . Ed was taller than Tom with lank blond hair that was apt to fall over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was about thirty-five . " And where 's Jeff ? " Tom fished out Gauloises and whisky from the red net , then the smuggled Pernod from his suitcase . " For the house . " " Oh , super ! Jeff 's at the gallery . Listen , Tom , you 'll do it ? ? Because I 've got the stuff here and there is n't too much time . " " I 'll try it , " Tom said . " Bernard 's due . He 'll help us . Briefing . " Ed looked hecticly at his wristwatch . Tom had removed his topcoat and jacket . " Ca n't Derwatt be a little late ? Is n't the opening at five ? " " Oh , of course . No need to get there till six , anyway , but I do want to try the make-up . Jeff said to remind you you 're not much shorter than Derwatt was  --  and who remembers those statistics ? Assuming I ever wrote them anywhere ? And Derwatt had bluish gray eyes . But yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea ? " " No , thanks . " Tom was looking at the dark blue suit on Jeff 's couch . It looked too wide , and it was unpressed . A pair of awful black shoes were on the floor by the couch . " Why do n't you have a drink ? " Tom suggested to Ed , because Ed looked as jumpy as a cat . As usual , another person 's nervousness was making Tom feel calm . The doorbell rang . Ed let Bernard Tufts in . Tom extended a hand . " Bernard , how are you ? " " All right , thank you , " Bernard said , sounding miserable . Bernard was thin and olive-skinned , with straight black hair and gentle dark eyes .  | Tom thought it best not to try to talk to Bernard just now , but to be simply efficient . Ed drew a basin of water in Jeff 's tiny but modem bathroom , and Tom submitted to a hair rinse to make his hair darker . Bernard began to talk , but only after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He walked with a slight stoop , " Bernard said . " His voice ? He was a little shy in public . It was sort of a monotone , I suppose . Like this , if I can illustrate , " Bernard said in a monotone . " Now and then he laughed . " " Do n't we all ! " Tom said , laughing nervously himself . Now Tom was sitting in a straight chair , being combed by Ed . On Tom 's right was a platter of what looked like barbershop floor sweepings , but Ed shook this out , and it was a beard fastened to fine flesh-colored gauze . " Good God , I hope the lights are dim , " Tom murmured . " We 'll see to that , " said Ed . While Ed worked with a moustache , Tom pulled off his two rings , one a wedding ring , one Dickie Greenleaf 's ring , and pocketed them . He asked Bernard to bring him the ring from his left trousers pocket , and Bernard did . Bernard 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask him how Cynthia was , and remembered that Bernard was not seeing her any more , information years old now . They had been going to marry , Tom remembered . Ed was snipping at Tom 's hair with scissors , creating a bush in front . " And Derwatt ? " Bernard stopped , because his voice had cracked . " Oh , shut up , Bernard ! " Ed said , laughing almost hysterically . Bernard laughed also . " Sorry . Really , I 'm sorry . " He sounded contrite , as if he meant it . The beard was going on , with glue . Ed said , " I want you to walk around a bit here , Tom . Get used to it . At the gallery ? You wo n't have to go in with the crowd , we decided against that . There 's a back door , and Jeff will let us in . We 'll invite some of the press to come into the office , you see , and we 'll have just one standing lamp on across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ceiling bulb , so that ca n't go on . "  | The gluey beard felt cool on Tom 's face . In the mirror in Jeff 's loo , he looked a little like D. H. Lawrence , he thought . His mouth was surrounded by hair . It was a sensation Tom did not like . Below the mirror on a little shelf three snapshots of Derwatt were propped up  --  Derwatt reading a book in shirtsleeves in a deckchair , Derwatt standing with a man Tom did not know , facing the camera . Derwatt had glasses in all the pictures . " The specs , " Ed said , as if he read Tom 's thoughts . Tom took the round-rimmed glasses Ed handed him , and put them on . That was better . Tom smiled , gently so as not to spoil the drying beard . The specs were plain glass , apparently . Tom walked with a stoop back into the studio , and said in what he hoped was Derwatt 's voice , " Now tell me about this man Murchison ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands flailing wildly . " This man Murchison , " Tom repeated . Bernard said , " M-Murchison , according to Jeff , thinks ? Derwatt has returned to an old technique . In his painting The Clock , you see . I do n't know what he means  --  specifically  --  to tell you the truth . " Bernard shook his head quickly , pulled a handkerchief from somewhere and blew his nose . " I was just looking at one of Jeff 's shots of The Clock . I have n't seen it in three years , you see . Not the picture itself . " Bernard was talking softly , as if the walls might be listening . " Is Murchison an expert ? " Tom asked , thinking , what was an expert ? " No , he 's just an American businessman , " Ed said . " He collects . He 's got a bee in his bonnet . " It was more than that , Tom thought , or they would n't all be so upset . " Am I supposed to be braced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Is he , Bernard ? " Bernard almost gasped , then tried to laugh , and for an instant he looked as he had looked years ago , younger , naive . Tom realized that Bernard was thinner than when he had last seen him three or four years ago . " I wish I knew , " Bernard said . " You must only  --  stand by the fact that the picture , The Clock , is Derwatt's. "  | " Trust me , " Tom said . He was walking about , practising the stoop , assuming a slowish rhythm which he hoped was correct . " But , " Bernard went on , " if Murchison wants to continue whatever he 's talking about , whatever it is  --  Man in Chair you 've got , Tom ? " A forgery . " He need never see that , " said Tom . " I love it , myself . " " The Tub , " Bernard added . " It 's in the show . " " You 're worried about that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Bernard said . " Maybe . " " Then you know what technique Murchison is talking about ? Why do n't you take The Tub out of the show if you 're worried about it ? " Ed said , " It was announced on the program . We were afraid if we removed it , Murchison might want to see it . " The conversation got nowhere , because Tom could not get a clear statement of what they , or Murchison , meant by the technique in these particular pictures . " You 'll never meet Murchison , so stop worrying , " Ed said to Bernard . " Have you met him ? " Tom asked Ed . " No , only Jeff has . This morning . " " And what 's he like ? " " Jeff said about fifty or so , a big American type . Polite enough but stubborn. ? Was n't there a belt in those trousers ? " Tom tightened the belt in his trousers . He sniffed at the sleeve of his jacket . There was a faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all the cigarette smoke . And anyway , Derwatt could have been wearing Mexican clothes for the past few years , and his European clothes might have been put away . Tom looked at himself in a long mirror , under one of Jeff 's very bright spotlights that Ed had put on , and suddenly doubled over with laughter . Tom turned around and said , " Sorry , I was just thinking that considering Derwatt 's fantastic earnings , he certainly hangs onto his old gear ! " " That 's okay , he 's a recluse , " Ed said . The telephone rang . Ed answered , and Tom heard him assuring someone , no doubt Jeff , that Tom had arrived and was ready to go .  | Tom did not feel quite ready to go . He felt sweaty from nerves . He said to Bernard , trying to sound cheerful , " How 's Cynthia ? Do you ever see her ? " " I do n't see her any more . Not very often , anyway . " Bernard glanced at Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's she going to say when she finds out Derwatt 's come back to London for a few days ? " Tom asked . " I do n't think she 'll say anything , " Bernard replied dully . " She 's not  --  going to spoil things , I 'm sure . " Ed finished his telephone conversation . " Cynthia wo n't say anything , Tom . She 's like that . You remember her , do n't you , Tom ? " " Yes . Slightly , " Tom said . " If she has n't said anything by now , she 's not going to , " Ed said . The way he said it made it sound like , " She 's not a bad sport or a blabble-mouth . " " She is quite wonderful , " Bernard said dreamily , to nobody . He suddenly got up and darted for the bathroom , perhaps because he had to go there , but it might have been to throw up . " Do n't worry about Cynthia , Tom , " Ed said softly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , here in London . She 's been quiet for three years or so . Well , you know  --  since she broke up with Bernard . Or he broke up with her . " " Is she happy ? Found somebody else ? " " Oh , she has a boy friend , I think . " Bernard was coming back . Tom had a scotch . Bernard took a Pernod , and Ed drank nothing . He was afraid to , he said , because he 'd had a sedative . By 5 o'clock , Tom had been briefed or refreshed on several things : the town in Greece where Derwatt had officially last been seen nearly six years ago . Tom , in case he was queried , was to say he had left Greece under another name on a Greek tanker bound for Vera Cruz , working as oiler and ship 's painter . They borrowed Bernard 's topcoat , which was older looking than Tom 's or any of Jeff 's in his closet . Then Tom and Ed set off , leaving Bernard in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . " My God , he 's down in the mouth , " Tom said on the pave-  | ment . He was walking with a slump . " How long can he go on like this ? " " Do n't judge by today . He 'll go on . He 's always like this when there 's a show . " Bernard was the old workhorse , Tom supposed . Ed and Jeff were burgeoning on extra money , good food , good living . Bernard merely produced the pictures that made it possible . Tom drew back sharply from a taxi , not having expected it to be bowling along on the left side of the road . Ed smiled . " That 's great . Keep it up . " They came to a taxi rank and got into a cab . " And this  --  caretaker or manager at the gallery , " Tom said . " What 's his name ? " " Leonard Craig , " Ed said . " He 's about twenty-six . Queer as Dick 's hatband , belongs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jeff and I let him into the circle . Had to . It 's really safer , because he ca n't spring any blackmail , if he signed a written agreement with us to care-take the place , which he did . We pay him well enough and he 's amused . He also sends us some good buyers . " Ed looked at Tom and smiled . " Do n't forget a bit of woikin ' class accent . You can do it quite well as I remember . "  | Ed Banbury rang a bell at a dark red door flush with the back of a building . Tom heard a key being turned , then the door opened and Jeff stood there , beaming at them . " Tom ! It 's super ! " Jeff whispered . They went down a short corridor , then into a cosy office with a desk and typewriter , books , cream-colored wall-to-wall carpeting . Canvases and portfolios of drawings leaned against the wall . " I ca n't tell you how right you look  --  Derwatt ! " Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make your beard fall off . " " Even a high wind would n't , " Ed put in . Jeff Constant had gained weight , and his face was flushed ? or perhaps he had been using a sun-tan lamp . His shirt cuffs were adorned with square gold links , and his blue and black striped suit looked brand-new . Tom noticed that a toupee ? what they called a hairpiece  --  covered the bald spot on the top of Jeff 's head , which Tom knew must be quite barren by now . Through the closed door that led to the gallery came a hubbub of voices , lots of voices , out of which a woman 's laugh leaped like a porpoise over the surface of a troubled sea , Tom thought , though he was not in the mood for poerty now . " Six o'clock , " Jeff announced , flashing more cuff to see  | his watch . " I shall now quietly tell a few of the press that Derwatt in here . This being England , there will not be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ed interrupted . " ? not be a stampede , " Jeff said firmly . " I 'll see to that . " " You 'll sit back here . Or stand , as you like , " Ed said , indicating the desk which was set at an angle and had a chair behind it . " This Murchison chap is here ? " Tom asked in Derwatt tones . Jeff 's fixed smile widened , but a little uneasily . " Oh , yes . You ought to see him , of course . But after the press . " Jeff was jumpy , eager to be off , though he looked as if he might have said more , and he went out . The key turned in the lock . " Any water anywhere ? " Tom asked . Ed showed him a small bathroom , which had been concealed by a section of bookshelf that swung out . Tom took a hasty gulp , and as he stepped out of the bathroom , two gentlemen of the press were coming in with Jeff , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the other in his twenties , but their expressions were much alike . " May I present Mr. Gardiner of the Telegraph , " Jeff said . " Derwatt . And Mr. ? " " Perkins , " said the younger man . " Sunday . . . " Another knock on the door before they could exchange greetings . Tom walked with a stoop , almost rheumatically , toward the desk . The single lamp in the room was near the door to the gallery , a good ten feet away from him . But Tom had noticed that Mr. Perkins carried a flash camera . Four more men and one woman were admitted . Tom feared a woman 's eyes , under the circumstances , more than anything . She was introduced to him as a Miss Eleanor Somebody of the Manchester Something or other . Then the questions began to fly , although Jeff suggested that each reporter should ask his questions in turn . This was a useless proposal , as each reporter was too eager to get his own questions answered . " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Mr. Derwatt , we 're so surprised to see you here . What made you decide to come to London ? "  | " Do n't call me Mister Derwatt , " Tom said grumpily . " Just Derwatt . " " Do you like the latest  --  group of canvases you 've done ? Do you think they 're your best ? " " Derwatt  --  are you living alone in Mexico ? " asked Eleanor Somebody . " Yes . " " Could you tell us the name of your village ? " Three more men came in , and Tom was aware of Jeff urging one of them to wait outside . " One thing I will not tell you is the name of my village , " Tom said slowly . " It would n't be fair to the inhabitants . " " Derwatt , uh ? " " Derwatt , certain critics have said ? " Someone was banging with fists on the door . Jeff banged back and yelled , " No more just now , please ! " " Certain critics have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splitting , and Jeff set his shoulder against it . The door was not giving , Tom saw , and turned his calm eyes from it to regard his questioner. " ? have said that your work resembles a period of Picasso 's related to his cubist period , when he began to split faces and forms . " " I have no periods , " Tom said . " Picasso has periods . That 's why you ca n't put your finger on Picasso  --  if anybody wants to . It 's impossible to say I like Picasso , ' because no one period comes to mind . Picasso plays . That 's all right . But by doing this he destroys what might be a genuine  --  a genuine and integrated personality . ' What is Picasso 's personality ? " The reporters scribbled diligently . " What is your favorite painting in this show ? Which do you think you like best ? " " I have no ? No , I ca n't say that I have a favorite painting in this show . Thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached for Jeff 's Craven A 's and lit one with a table lighter before two reporters could spring to his cigarette . Tom drew back to protect his beard from their fire . " My favorites perhaps are the old ones ? The Red Chairs , Falling  | Woman , maybe. ? Sold alas . " Out of nowhere , Tom had recalled the last title . It did exist . " Where is that ? I do n't know that , but I know the name , " someone said . Shyly , recluse-like , Tom kept his eyes on the leatherbound blotter on Jeff 's desk . " I 've forgot . Falling Woman . Sold to an American , I think . " The reporters plunged in again : " Are you pleased with your sales , Derwatt ? " ( Who would n't be ? ) " Does Mexico inspire you ? I notice there are no canvases in the show with a Mexican setting . " ( A slight hurdle , but Tom got over it . He had always painted from imagination . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in Mexico , Derwatt ? " asked Eleanor . ( This Tom could do . A one-story house with four rooms . A banana tree out front . A girl came to clean every morning at io , and did a little shopping for him at noon , bringing back freshly baked tortillas , which he ate with red beans  --  frijoles ? for lunch . Yes , meat was scarce , but there was some goat . The girl 's name ? Juana . ) " Do they call you Derwatt in the village ? " " They used to , and they had a very different way of pronouncing it , I can tell you . Now it 's Filipo . There 's no need of another name but Don Filipo . " " They have no idea that you 're Derwatt ? " Tom laughed a little again . " I do n't think they 're much interested in the Times or Art Review or whatever . " " Have you missed London ? How does it look to you ? " " Was it just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perkins asked . " Yes . Just a whim . " Tom smiled the worn , philosophic smile of a man who had gazed upon Mexican mountains , alone , for years . " Do you ever go to Europe  --  incognito ? We know you like seclusion ? " " Derwatt , I 'd be most grateful if you could find ten minutes tomorrow . May I ask where you 're ? "  | " I 'm sorry , I have n't yet decided where I 'm stopping , " Tom said . Jeff gently urged the reporters to take leave , and the cameras began to flash . Tom looked downward , then upward for one or two photographs on request . Jeff admitted a waiter in a white jacket with a tray of drinks . The tray was emptied in a trice . Tom lifted a hand in a gesture of shy , gracious farewell . " Thank you all . " " No more , please , " Jeff said at the door . " But I ? " " Ah , Mr. Murchison . Come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom . " Derwatt , this is Mr. Murchison . From America . " Mr. Murchison was large , with a pleasant face . " How do you do , Mr. Derwatt ? " he said , smiling . " What an unexpected treat to meet you here in London ! " They shook hands . " How do you do ? " Tom said . " And this is Edmund Banbury , " Jeff said . " Mr. Murchison . " Ed and Mr. Murchison exchanged greetings . " I 've got one of your paintings  --  The Clock . In fact , I brought it with me . " Mr. Murchison was smiling widely now , staring with fascination and respect at Tom , and Tom hoped his gaze was dazzled by the surprise of actually seeing him . " Oh , yes , " Tom said . Jeff again quietly locked the door . " Wo n't you sit down , Mr. Murchison ? " " Yes , thank you . " Murchison sat , on a straight chair . Jeff quietly began gathering empty glasses from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to the point , Mr. Derwatt , T  --  I 'm interested in a certain change of technique that you show in The Clock . You know , of course , the picture I mean ? " Murchison asked . Was that a casual or a pointed question , Tom wondered ? " Of course , " Tom said . " Can you describe it ? " Tom was still standing up . A slight chill went over him . Tom smiled . " I can never describe my pictures . It would n't surprise me if there were no clock in it . Did you know , Mr. Murchison , I do n't always make up my own titles ? And how  | anyone got Sunday Noon out of that particular canvas is beyond me . " ( Tom had glanced at the gallery program of twentyeight Derwatts now on exhibit , a program which Jeff or someone had thoughtfully opened and placed on the blotter of the desk . ) " Is that your effort , Jeff ? " Jeff laughed . " No , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Murchison ? I 'll get you one from the bar . " " No , thank you , I 'm fine . " Then Mr. Murchison addressed Tom . " It 's a bluish-black clock held by ? Do you remember ? " He smiled as if he were asking an innocent riddle . " I think a little girl  --  who 's facing the beholder , shall we say ? " " Hm-m . Right , " said Murchison . " But then you do n't do little boys , do you ? " Tom chuckled , relieved that he 'd guessed right . " I suppose I prefer little girls . " Murchison lit a Chesterfield . He had brown eyes , light brown wavy hair , and a strong jaw covered with just a little too much flesh , like the rest of him . " I 'd like you to see my picture . I have a reason . Excuse me a minute . I left it with the coats . " Jeff let him out the door , then locked the door again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing against a wall of books , silent . Tom said in a whisper : " Really , boys , if the damned canvas has been in the coat room all this time , could n't one of you 've whisked it out and burnt it ? " " Ha-ha ! " Ed laughed nervously . Jeff 's plump smile was a twitch , though he kept his poise , as if Murchison was still in the room . " Well , let us hear him out , " Tom said in a slow and confident Derwatt tone . He tried to shoot his cuffs , but they did n't shoot . Murchison came back carrying a brown paper-wrapped picture under one arm . It was a medium-sized Derwatt , perhaps two feet by three . " I paid five thousand dollars for this , " he said , smiling . " You may think it careless of me to leave it in the cloakroom , but I 'm inclined to trust people . " He was undoing the wrapping with the aid of a penknife . " Do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the picture . " Of course I do . "  | " You remember painting it ? " " It 's my picture , " Tom said . " It 's the purples in this that interest me . The purple . This is straight cobalt violet  --  as you can probably see better than I. " Mr. Murchison smiled almost apologetically for a moment . " The picture is at least three years old , because I bought it three years ago . But if I 'm not mistaken , you abandoned cobalt violet for a mixture of cad red and ultramarine five or six years ago . I ca n't exactly fix the date . " Tom was silent . In the picture Murchison had , the clock was black and purple . The brushstrokes and the color resembled those of Man in Chair ( painted by Bernard ) at home . Tom did n't know quite what , in the purple depaituuent , Murchison was hammering at . A little girl in a pink-and-apple-green dress was holding the clock , or rather resting her hand on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . " To tell you the truth , I 've forgot , " Tom said . " Perhaps I did use straight cobalt violet there . " " And also in the painting called The Tub outside , " Murchison said , with a nod toward the gallery . " But in none of the others . I find it curious . A painter does n't usually go back to a color he 's discarded . The cad red and ultramarine combination is far more interesting  --  in my opinion . Your newer choice . " Tom was unworried . Ought he to be more worried ? He shrugged slightly . Jeff had gone into the little bathroom and was fussing about with glasses and ashtrays . " How many years ago did you paint The Clock ? " Murchison asked . " That I 'm afraid I ca n't tell you , " Tom said in a frank manner . He had grasped Murchison 's point , at least in regard to time , and he added , " It could have been four or five years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sold to me as an old one . And The Tub . That 's dated only last year , and it has the same straight cobalt violet in it . " The cobalt violet for the purpose of shadow , one might say , was not dominant in The Clock . Murchison had an eagle eye . Tom thought The Red Chairs  --  the earlier and genuine Derwatt  | ? had the same straight cobalt , and he wondered if it had a fixed date ? If he could say The Red Chairs was only three years old , prove it somehow , Murchison could simply go to hell . Check with Jeff and Ed later on that , Tom thought . " You definitely remember painting The Clock ? " Murchison asked . " I know it 's my picture , " Tom said . " I might have been in Greece or even Ireland when I painted it , because I do n't remember dates , and the dates the gallery might have are not always the dates when I painted something . " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with good-natured American conviction . " Good heavens , why not ? " Tom 's good-nature matched Murchison 's . " I have a nerve sticking my neck out like this , I know . But I 've recently seen some of your earlier work in a museum in Philadelphia . If I may say so , Mr. Derwatt , you 're ? " " Just call me Derwatt . I like it better . " " Derwatt . You 're so prolific , I think you might forget ? I should say not remember a painting . Granted The Clock is in your style and the theme is typical of your ? " Jeff , like Ed , was listening attentively , and in this pause Jeff said , " But after all this picture came from Mexico along with a few others of Derwatt 's . He always sends two or three at a time . " " Yes . The Clock has a date on the back . It 's three years old , written in the same black paint as Derwatt 's signature , " Murchison said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I had the signature and the date paint analysed in the States . That 's how carefully I 've gone into this , " Murchison said , smiling . " I do n't quite know what the trouble is , " Tom said . " I painted it in Mexico if the date 's three years old in my own writing . " Murchison looked at Jeff . " Mr. Constant , you say you received The Clock along with two others , perhaps , in a certain shipment ? " " Yes . Now that I recall  --  I think the other two are here now , lent by London owners  --  The Orange Barn and ? Do you recall the other , Ed ? "  | " I think it 's Bird Spectre probably . Is n't it ? " From Jeff 's nod , Tom could see it was true , or else Jeff was doing well at pretending . " That 's it , " said Jeff . " They 're not in this technique . There 's purple in them , but made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine  --  genuinely later pictures at any rate . " Murchison was slightly wrong , they were phonies as well . Tom scratched his beard , but very gently . He kept a quiet , somewhat amused air . Murchison looked from Jeff to Tom . " You may think I 'm being bumptious , but if you 'll excuse me , Derwatt , I think you 've been forged . I 'll stick my neck out farther , I 'll bet my life that The Clock is n't yours . " " But Mr. Murchison , " Jeff said , " that 's a matter of simply ? " " Of showing me a receipt for a certain number of paintings in a certain year ? Paintings received from Mexico which might not be even titled ? What if Derwatt does n't give them a title ? " " The Buckm.aster Gallery is the only authorized dealer for Derwatt 's work . You bought that picture from us . " " I 'm aware of that , " said Murchison . " And I 'm not accusing you  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think this is a Derwatt . I ca n't tell you what happened . " Murchison looked at all of them in turn , a bit embarrassed by his own outburst , but still carried along by his conviction . " My theory is that a painter never reverts to a single color which he once used or any combination of colors once he has made a change to another color as subtle and yet as important as lavender is in Derwatt 's paintings . Do you agree , Derwatt ? " Tom sighed and touched his moustache with a forefinger . " I ca n't say . I 'm not so much of a theoretician as you , it seems . " A pause . " Well , Mr. Murchison , what would you like us to do about The Clock ? Refund your money ? " Jeff asked . " We 'd be happy to do that , because ? Derwatt has just verified it , and frankly it 's worth more than five thousand dollars now . " Tom hoped Mr. Murchison would accept , but he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pushed his hands into his trousers  | pockets and looked at Jeff . " Thank you , but I 'm more interested in my theory  --  my opinion , than in the money . And since I 'm in London , where there 're as good judges of painting as anywhere in the world , maybe the best , I intend to have The Clock looked at by an expert and compared with  --  certain indisputable Derwatts . " " Very well , " said Tom amiably . " Thank you very much for seeing me , Derwatt . A pleasure to meet you . " Murchison held out his hand . Tom shook it firmly . " A pleasure , Mr. Murchison . " Ed helped Murchison wrap up his painting , and provided more string , as Murchison 's string would no longer tie . " Can I reach you through the gallery here ? " Murchison said to Tom . " Say tomorrow ? " " Oh , yes , " Tom said . " They 'll know where I am . " When Murchison had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well  --  how serious is it ? " Tom asked . Jeff knew more about pictures . He spoke first , with difficulty . " It 's serious if he drags in an expert , I suppose . And he will . He may have a point about the purples . One might call it a clue that could lead to worse . " Tom said , " Why do n't we go back to your studio , Jeff ? Can you whisk me out the back door again  --  like Cinderella ? " " Yep , but I want to speak to Leonard . " Jeff grinned . " I 'll drag him in to meet you . " He went out . The hum from the gallery was less now . Tom looked at Ed , whose face was a bit pale . I can disappear , but you ca n't , Tom thought . Tom squared his shoulders , and lifted his fingers in a V. " Chin up , Banbury . We 'll see this one through . " " Or that 's what they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more vulgar gesture . Jeff came back with Leonard , a smallish , neat young man in an Edwardian suit with many buttons and velvet facings . Leonard burst into laughter at the sight of Derwatt , and Jeff shushed him . " It is marvelous , marvelous ! " Leonard said , looking Tom over with a genuine admiration . " I 've seen so many pictures , you know ! I have n't seen anything so good since I did Toulouse-  | Lautrec with my feet tied up behind me ! ? That was last year . " Leonard stared at Tom . " Who are you ? " " That , " Jeff said , " you are not to know . Suffice it to say ? " " Suffice it to say , " Ed said , " Derwatt has just given a brilliant interview to the press . " " And tomorrow Derwatt is no more . He will return to ' Mexico , " Jeff in a whisper . " Now back to your duties , Leonard . " " Ciao , " said Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leonard , bowing . He backed toward the door , and added , " The crowd 's nearly all gone . So 's the booze . " He slipped out . Tom was not quite so cheerful . He very much wanted out of his disguise . The situation was a problem , not yet solved . Back at Jeff 's studio , they found that Bernard Tufts had gone . Ed and Jeff seemed surprised . And Tom was a little uneasy , because Bernard ought to know what was going on . " You can reach Bernard of course , " Tom said . " Oh , sure , " said Ed . He was making some tea for himself in Jeff 's kitchen . " Bernard 's always chez lui . He 's got a telphone . " It crossed Tom 's mind that even the telephone might not be safe to use for long . " Mr. Murchison is going to want to see you again probably , " Jeff said . " With the expert . So you 've got to disappear . You 'll leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jeff was sipping a Pernod . He looked more confident , perhaps because the press interview and even the Murchison interview had gone reasonably well , Tom thought . " Mexico my foot , " Ed said , coming in with his cup of tea . " Derwatt will be somewhere in England staying with friends , and even we wo n't know where . Let some days pass . Then he 'll go to Mexico . By what means ? Who knows ? " Tom removed his baggy jacket . " Is there a date for The Red Chairs ? " " Yes , " Jeff said . " It 's six years old . " " Printed here and there , I suppose ? " Tom asked . " I was thinking of updating it  --  to get over this purple business . " Ed and Jeff glanced at each other , and Ed said quickly , " No , it 's in too many catalogs . "  | " There 's one way out , have Bernard do several canvases ? two anyway  --  with the plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of purple . " But Tom felt discouraged as he said it , and he knew why . Tom felt that it might be Bernard that they could n't count on any longer . Tom looked away from Jeff and Ed . They were dubious . He tried standing up , straight , feeling confident of his Derwatt disguise . " Did I ever tell you about my honeymoon ? " Tom asked in Derwatt 's monotone . " No , tell us about your honeymoon ! " Jeff said , ready for a laugh and grinning already . Tom assumed Derwatt 's stoop . " It was  --  most inhibiting ? the atmosphere . In Spain . We 'd taken a hotel suite , you see , and there I was with Heloise , and downstairs in the patio a parrot sang Carmen  --  badly . And every time we ? Well , there it came : **31;722;TOOLONG ! Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-heaaaa ! ' People leaned out windows yelling in Spanish , Shut your filthy beak ! Who taught that  --  unmentionable object to sing Carmen ? Kill it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make love while laughing . Have you ever tried it ? Well  --  they say laughter distinguishes the human from the animal . And  --  the other thing certainly does n't . Ed , can you get me out of this foliage ? " Ed was laughing , and Jeff rolling on the sofa in relief ? which Tom knew would be temporary  --  from the recent strain . " Come in the Ioo . " Ed turned on the hot water in the basin . Tom changed into his own trousers and shirt . If he could lure Murchison to his house somehow , before Murchison spoke to the expert he was talking about , perhaps something  --  Tom did n't know what  --  could be done about the situation . " Where 's Murchison staying in London ? " " Some hotel , " Jeff said . " He did n't say which . " " Can you ring a few hotels and see if you can find him ? " Before Jeff got to the telephone , it rang . Tom heard Jeff telling someone that Derwatt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where he was going . " He 's very much a loner , " Jeff said . " Another gentleman of the press , " Jeff said when he had hung up , " trying to get a personal interview . " He opened  | a telephone book . " I 'll try the Dorchester first . He looks like a Dorchester type . " " Or a Westbury type , " Ed said . It took a lot of delicately applied water to remove the gauze of the beard . Afterward came a shampoo to get the rinse out of his hair . Tom finally heard Jeff say in a cheerful tone , " No , thank you , I 'll ring back later . " Then Jeff said , " It 's the Mandeville . That 's off Wigmore Street . " Tom put on his own pink shirt from Venice . Then he went to the telephone and booked a room at the Mandeville under the name Thomas Ripley . He would arrive by 8 P.M. or so , he said . " What 're you going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little . " I do n't know just yet , " he said , which was true .  | The Hotel Mandeville was rather plush , but by no means as expensive as the Dorchester . Tom arrived at 8:15 P.M. and registered , giving his address as Villeperce-sur-Seine . It had crossed his mind to give a false name and some English country address , because he might get into considerable difficulties with Mr. Murchison and have to disappear quickly , but there was also the possibility of inviting Murchison to France , in which case Tom might need his real name . Tom asked a bellhop to take his suitcase to his room , and then he looked into the bar , hoping Mr. Murchison might be there . Mr. Murchison was not there , but Tom decided to have a lager and wait a few moments . A ten-minute wait with a lager and an Evening Standard brought no Mr. Murchison . The neighborhood was full of restaurants , Tom knew , but he could hardly approach Murchison 's table and strike up an acquaintance on the strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day . Or could he  --  saying he had also seen Murchison going into the back room to meet Derwatt ? Yes . Tom was just about to venture out to explore the local restaurants , when he saw Mr. Murchison coming into the bar , gesturing to someone to follow him . And to Tom 's surprise , horror even , he saw that the other  | person was Bernard Tufts . Tom slipped quickly out the door on the other side of the bar , which opened onto the pavement . Bernard had n't seen him , Tom was fairly sure . He looked around for a telephone booth , for another hotel from which to telephone , and finding none , he went back into the Mandeville by the main entrance and took his key for his room , number four eleven . In his room , Tom rang Jeff 's studio . Three rings , four , five , then to Tom 's relief , Jeff answered . " Hello , Tom ! I was just going down the stairs with Ed when I heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to know where Bernard is now ? " " Oh , we 're leaving him alone tonight . He 's upset . " " He 's having a drink with Murchison in the bar of the Mandeville . " " What ? " " I 'm ringing from my room . Now whatever you do , Jeff ? Are you listening ? " " Yes-yes . " " Do n't tell Bernard I saw him . Do n't tell Bernard I 'm at the Mandeville . And do n't get in a flap about anything . That 's providing Bernard is n't spilling the beans now , I do n't know . " " Oh , my God , " Jeff groaned . " No-no . Bernard would n't spill the beans . I do n't think he would . " " Are you in later tonight ? " " Yes , by ? Oh , home before midnight , anyway . " " I 'll try to ring you . But do n't be worried if I do n't . Do n't try to ring me because  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said with a sudden laugh . Jeff laughed , but a bit sickly . " Okay , Tom . " Tom hung up . He definitely wanted to see Murchison tonight . Would Murchison and Bernard have dinner ? That would be a bore to wait out . Tom hung up a suit and stuck a couple of shirts in a drawer . He splashed some more water on his face and looked in the mirror to make sure every bit of glue was gone . Out of restlessness , he left his room , his topcoat over his arm . He would take a walk , to Soho perhaps , and find a place  | for dinner . In the lobby , he looked through the glass doors of the Mandeville bar . He was in luck . Murchison sat alone , signing the bill , and the street door of the bar was just then closing , perhaps even with Bernard 's departure . Still , Tom glanced around in the lobby , in case Bernard had slipped out to the men 's room and might be coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until Murchison was actually standing up to leave before he went into the bar . Tom looked depressed and thoughtful , and in fact he felt that way . He looked twice at Murchison , whose eyes met his once , as if he were recalling Murchison from somewhere . Then Tom approached him . " Excuse me . I think I saw you at the Derwatt show today . " Tom had put on an American accent , midwestern with a hard r in Derwatt . " Why , yes , I was there , " Murchison said . " I thought you looked like an American . So am I. Do you like Derwatt ? " Tom was being as naive and straightforward as possible without seeming dim-witted . " Yes , I certainly do . " " I own two of his canvases , " Tom said with pride . " I may buy one of the ones in the show today  --  if it 's left . I have n't decided yet . The Tub . " " Oh ? So do I own one , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's it called ? " " Why do n't you sit down ? " Murchison was standing , but indicated the chair opposite him . " Would you care for a drink ? " " Thanks , I do n't mind if I do . " Murchison sat down . " My picture is called The Clock . How nice to run into someone who owns a Derwatt , too  --  or a couple of them ! " A waiter came . " Scotch for me , please . And you ? " he asked Tom . " A gin and tonic , " Tom said . He added , " I 'm staying here at the Mandeville , so these drinks are on me . " " We 'll argue about that later . Tell me what pictures you have . " " The Red Chairs , " Tom said , " and ? "  | " Really ? That 's a gem ! The Red Chairs . Do you live in London ? " " No , in France . " " Oh , " with disappointment . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chair . " " I do n't know that , " Murchison said . For a few minutes , they discussed Derwatt 's odd personality , and Tom said he had seen Murchison go into a back room of the gallery where he had heard Derwatt was . " Only the press was let in , but I crashed the gate , " Murchison told Tom . " You see , I 've got a rather special reason for being here just now , and when I heard Derwatt was here this afternoon at the gallery , I was n't going to let the opportunity slip . " " Yes ? What 's your reason ? " Tom asked . Murchison explained . He explained his reasons for thinking Derwatt might be being forged , and Tom listened with rapt attention . It was a matter of Derwatt using a mixture of ultramarine and cadmium red now , for the past five years or so ( since before his death , Tom realized , so Derwatt had begun this , not Bernard ) , and of having in The Clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cobalt violet . Murchison himself painted , he told Tom , as a hobby . " I 'm no expert , believe me , but I 've read almost every book about painters and painting that exists . It would n't take an expert or a microscope to tell the difference between a single color and a mixture , but what I mean is , you 'll never find a painter going back to a color that he has consciously or unconsciously discarded . I say unconsciously , because when a painter chooses a new color or colors it is usually a decision made by his unconscious . Not that Derwatt uses lavender in every picture , no indeed . But my conclusion is that my Clock and possibly some other pictures , including The Tub that you 're interested in , by the way , are not Derwatts . " " That 's interesting . Very . Because as it happens my Man in Chair sort of corresponds to what you 're saying . I think . And Man in Chair is about four years old now . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you going to do about your Clock ? " Murchison lit one of his Chesterfields . " I have n't finished my story yet . I just had a drink with an Englishman whose  | name is Bernard Tufts , a painter also , and he seems to suspect the same thing about Derwatt . " Tom frowned hard . " Really ? It 's pretty important if someone 's forging Derwatts . What did the man say ? " " I have the feeling he knows more than he 's saying . I doubt if he 's in on any of it . He 's not a crooked type , and he does n't look as if he had much money , either . But he seems to know the London art scene . He simply warned me , Do n't buy any more Derwatts , Mr. Murchison . ' Now what do you think of that ? " " Hm-m . But what 's he got to go on ? " " As I say , I do n't know . I could n't get anything out of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , and he said he called eight London hotels before he found me . I asked him how he knew my name , and he said , Oh , word gets around . ' ? Very strange , since the Buckmaster Gallery people are the only people I 've spoken to . Do n't you think ? I have an appointment with a Tate Gallery man tomorrow , but even he does n't know it 's in regard to a Derwatt . " Murchison drank some of his scotch and said , " When paintings start coming from Mexico ? Do you know what I 'm going to do tomorrow besides showing The Clock to Mr. Riemer at the Tate Gallery , I 'm going to ask if I or he has the right to see the receipts or books of the Buckmaster Gallery people in regard to Derwatt paintings sent from Mexico . It 's not the titles I 'm so interested in , and Derwatt told me he does n't always title them , it 's the number of paintings . Surely they 're let in by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded , there 's a reason. ? Would n't it be amazing if Derwitt himself were being hoodwinked and a few Derwatts  --  well , some said to be four or five years old , for instance  --  were being painted right here in London ? " Yes , Tom thought . Amazing . " But you said you spoke with Derwatt . Did you talk to him about your painting ? " " I showed it to him ! He said it was his , but he was n't dead sure of it in my opinion . He did n't say , By God , that 's mine ! ' He looked at it for a couple of minutes and said , Of course , it 's mine . ' It was maybe presumptuous of me , but I said to Derwatt I thought it was possible he could forget a canvas or two , an untitled canvas that he 'd done years ago . "  | Tom frowned as if he doubted this , which he did . Even a painter who did not give titles to his paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing , perhaps . But he let Murchison continue . " And for another thing , I do n't quite like the men at the Buckmaster Gallery . Jeffrey Constant . And the journalist Edmund Banbury , who 's obviously a close friend of Constant 's . They 're old friends of Derwatt 's , I realize that . I get The Listener and Art Review and also the Sunday Times in Long Island where I live . I see articles by Banbury quite often , usually with a plug for Derwatt , if the article is n't on Derwatt . And do you know what occurred to me ? " " What ? " Tom asked . " That  --  just maybe Constant and Banbury are putting up with a few forgeries in order to sell more Derwatts than Derwatt can produce . I do n't go so far as to say Derwatt 's in on it . But would n't that be a funny story , if Derwatt 's so absent-minded he ca n't even remember how many pictures he 's painted ? " Murchison laughed . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as funny as the truth , Mr. Murchison . Tom smiled . " So you 're going to show your picture to the expert tomorrow ? " " Come up and see it now ! " Tom tried to take the bill , but Murchison insisted upon signing . Tom went with him in the lift . Murchison had his painting in a corner of his closet , wrapped as Ed had wrapped it that afternoon . Tom looked at it with interest . " It 's a handsome picture , " Tom said . " Ah , no one can deny that ! " " You know ? " Tom propped it on the writing desk and was now looking at it from across the room with all the lights turned on . " It does have a similarity to my Man in Chair . Why do n't you come over and look at my picture ? I 'm very near Paris . If you think my picture might be forged , too , I 'll let you take it back with you to show in London . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could . " " If you 've been taken in , so have I , I think . " It would only be insulting to offer to pay for Murchison 's flight , Tom thought ,  | so he did not . " I 've a pretty big house and I 'm alone at the moment , except for my housekeeper . " " All right , I will , " said Murchison , who had n't sat down . " I intend to leave tomorrow afternoon . " " All right . I 'll postpone that Tate Gallery appointment . " " I 've lots of other paintings . Not that I 'm a collector . " Tom sat down in the largest chair . " I 'd like you to have a look at them . A Soutine . Two Magrittes . " " Really ? " Murchison 's eyes began to look a little dreamy . " How far are you from Paris ? " Ten minutes later , Tom was in his own room one floor below . Murchison had proposed that they have dinner together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appointment at to P.M. in Belgravia , so there was hardly time . Murchison had entrusted Tom with booking their ' plane tickets for tomorrow afternoon to Paris , a round-trip for Murchison . Tom picked up the telephone and booked two seats on a flight that left tomorrow afternoon , Thursday , at 2 P.M. for Orly . Tom had his own return ticket . He left a message downstairs for Murchison in regard to the flight . Then Tom ordered a sandwich and a half bottle of Medoc . After this , he napped until i i , and put in a telephone call to Reeves Minot in Hamburg . This took nearly half an hour . Reeves was not in , a man 's German-accented voice said . Tom decided to chance it , because he was fed up with Reeves , and said , " This is Tom Ripley . Has Reeves any message for me ? " " Yes . The message is Thursday . Tomorrow . The Count arrives in Milan tomorrow . Can you come to Milan tomorrow ? " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mir leid . " Tom did n't , as yet , want to say to this man , no matter who he was , that the Count already had an invitation to visit him when he next came to France . Reeves could n't expect him to drop everything all the time  --  Tom had done so on two other occasions  --  to fly to Hamburg or Rome , much as Tom enjoyed little excursions , pretend to be in those cities by accident , and invite the " host , " as Tom always thought of the carrier , to his Villeperce house . " I think there 's no great coin-  | plication , " Tom said . " Can you tell me the Count 's address in Milan ? " " Grand Hotel , " said the voice brusquely . " Would you tell Reeves I 'll be in touch tomorrow probably . Where can I reach him ? " " Tomorrow morning at the Grand Hotel in Milan . He is taking a train to Milan tonight . He does not like airplanes , you know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man like Reeves not liking airplanes . " I 'll ring him . And I 'm not in Munich now . I 'm in Paris . " " Paris ? " with surprise . " I know know Reeves tried to ring you in Munich at the Vierjahreszeiten . " That was too bad . Tom hung up politely . The hands of his wristwatch moved toward midnight . Tom puzzled about what to tell Jeff Constant tonight . And what to do about Bernard . A speech of reassurance sprang full-blown to Tom 's mind , and there was time to see Bernard before he left tomorrow afternoon , but Tom was afraid Bernard might be more upset and negative , if anybody made an obvious effort to reassure him . If Bernard had said to Murchison , " Do n't buy any more Derwatts , " it sounded as if Bernard was n't going to paint any more Derwatts , and that , of course , was going to be very bad for business . A still worse possibility , which Bernard might be on the brink of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or several purchasers of phony Derwatts . What state of mind was Bernard really in , and what was he up to ? Tom decided he should not say anything to Bernard . Bernard knew that he , Tom , had proposed his forging . Tom took a shower and began to sing : " Babbo non vuole Mamma nemmeno Come farema A far all ' amor ... " The Mandeville 's walls gave a feeling  --  maybe an illusion ? of being soundproof . Tom had not sung the song in a long  | time . He was pleased that it had come to him out of the blue , because it was a happy song , and Tom associated it with good luck . He got into pajamas and rang Jeff 's studio . Jeff answered at once . " Hello . What 's up ? " " I spoke with Mr. M. tonight , and we got along fine . He 's coming to France with me tomorrow . So that will delay things , you see . " " And  --  you 'll try to persuade him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something like that . " " Want me to come to your hotel , Tom ? You 're probably too tired to pop over here . Or are you ? " " No , but there 's no need . And you might just run into Mr. M. if you came here , and we do n't want that . " " No . " " Did you hear from Bernard ? " Tom asked . " No . " " Please tell him ? " Tom tried to find the right words . " Tell him that you  --  not me  --  happen to know Mr. M. is going to wait a few days before he does anything about his painting . I 'm mainly concerned that Bernard does n't blow up . Will you try to take care of that ? " " Why do n't you speak to Bernard ? " " Because it would be wrong , " Tom said somewhat crossly . Some people had no inkling of psychology ! " Tom , you were marvelous today , " Jeff said . " Thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Take care of Bernard . I 'll ring you before I take off . " " I expect to be in my studio all morning tomorrow . " They said good night . If he had told Jeff about Murchison 's intention to ask for receipts , the records of paintings sent from Mexico , Jeff would have been in a tizzy , Tom thought . He must warn Jeff about that tomorrow morning , ring him from a pavement telephone booth , or from a post office . Tom was wary of hotel switchboard listeners . Of course , he hoped to dissuade Murchison from his theory , but if he could n't , it would be just as well if the Buckmaster Gallery made some records that looked authentic .  | The next morning , breakfasting in bed  --  a privilege for which one paid a few Puritan shillings extra in England  --  Tom rang Mme. Annette . It was only 8 o'clock , but Tom knew she would have been up for nearly an hour , singing as she went about her chores of turning up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making her delicate infusion ( tea ) , because coffee in the morning made her heart beat fast , and adjusting her plants on various windowsills so they would catch the most sun . And she would be mightily pleased by a coup de fil from him in Londres . ' Allo ? ' allo ! " Operator furious . " ' Allo ? " Quizzical . " ' Allo ! " Three French operators were on the telephone at once , plus the woman at the Mandeville switchboard . At last , Mme. Annette came on . " It is very beautiful here this morning . Sunlight ! " Mme. Annette said . Tom smiled . He badly needed a voice of cheer . " Mme. Annette ? Yes , I am very well , thank you . How is the tooth ? ... Good ! I am telephoning to say I will be home this afternoon around four with an American gentleman . " " Ah-h ! " said Mme. Annette , pleased .  | " Our guest for tonight , perhaps for two nights , who knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With some flowers ? And for dinner perhaps tournedos with your own delicious bearnaise ? " Mme. Annette sounded delirious with joy that Tom would have a guest and she would have something definite to do . Then Tom rang Mr. Murchison , and they agreed to meet in the hotel lobby around noon and to take a taxi together to Heathrow . Tom went out , intending to walk to Berkeley Square , off which was a haberdashery where he bought a pair of silk pajamas as a small ritual nearly every time he came to London . It might also be his last chance this trip for a ride on the Underground . The Underground was a part of the atmosphere of London life , and Tom also was an admirer of Underground graffiti . The sun was struggling rather hopelessly through a wet haze , though it was not actually raining . Tom ducked into the Oxford Street station along with some last stragglers , perhaps , of the morning rush hour . What Tom admired about London graffiti-writers was their ability to scrawl things from moving escalators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but girls in girdles and panties , and they were adorned by anatomical additions male and female , sometimes whole phrases : I LOVE BEING HERMAPHRODITE ! How did they do it ? By running in an opposite direction from the escalator 's while writing ? WOGS OUT ! was a favorite everywhere , varied by WOGS OUT NOW ! Down on the train platform , Tom spotted a poster for the Zeffirelli Romeo and Juliet with Romeo naked on his back and Juliet crawling over him with a shocking proposal coming out of her mouth . Romeo 's reply in a balloon was " Okay , why do n't you ? " Tom had his pajamas by io:3o . He bought a yellow pair . He had wanted purple , as he had none now , but he had heard enough about purple lately . Tom took a taxi to Carnaby Street . For himself , he bought a pair of narrow satin-like trousers , as he did not care for flared cuffs . And for Heloise , flared hipsters of black wool , waist twenty-six . The booth where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could not step back from the mirror to see if the length was right , but Mme. Annette  | loved to adjust little things like that for him and Heloise . Besides , two Italians who kept saying " Bellissiro ! " were pulling back the curtain every few seconds , wanting to come in and try on their own gear . When Tom was paying , two Greeks arrived and began discussing prices loudly in drachmas . The shop was about six feet by twelve , and no wonder there was only one assistant , because there would have been no room for two . With his purchases in big crisp paper bags , Tom went to a pavement telephone booth and rang Jeff Constant . " I spoke with Bernard , " Jeff said , " and he 's absolutely terrified of Murchison . I asked him what he said to Murchison , because Bernard told me he 'd spoken with Murchison , you see . Bernard said he 'd told Murchison not to buy any more ? paintings . That 's bad enough , is n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what else ? " " Well  --  I tried to tell Bernard he 'd already said all he could or should . It 's difficult to explain because you do n't know Bernard , but he 's got such a guilt thing about Derwatt 's genius and all that . I tried to convince Bernard that he 'd eased his own conscience by saying that to Murchison , and why not let well enough alone ? " " What did Bernard say to that ? " " He 's so down in the mouth , it 's hard to tell what he said . The show was a sell-out , you see , except for one picture . Imagine ! And Bernard feels guilty about that ! " Jeff laughed . " The Tub . It 's one of the ones Murchison is picking on . " " If he does n't want to paint more just now , do n't force him . " " That 's exactly my attitude . You 're so right , Tom . But I think in about a fortnight , he 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strain of the show , and seeing you as Derwatt . He thinks more of Derwatt than most people do of Jesus Christ . " Tom did n't have to be told that . " One small thing , Jeff . Murchison may want to see the gallery 's books for Derwatt 's paintings . From Mexico . Do you keep some kind of record ? " " N-not from Mexico . " " Can you fake something ? Just in case I ca n't persuade him to drop the whole thing ? " " I 'll try , Tom . " Jeff sounded a bit off balance . Tom was impatient . " Fake something . Age it . Regardless of  | Mr. M. , is n't it a good idea to have a few books to substantiate ? " Tom broke off . Some people did n't know how to run a business , even a successful business like Derwatt , Ltd . " All right , Tom . " Tom detoured to the Burlington Arcade , where he stopped in a jewelry shop and bought a gold pin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he paid for with American Traveler 's Checks . Heloise 's birthday was next month . Then he walked on toward his hotel , via Oxford Street , which was crowded as usual with shoppers , women with bulging bags and boxes , children in tow . A sandwich man advertised a passport photo studio , service fast and cheap . The old fellow wore an ancient overcoat , a limp hat , and a sordid unlit cigarette hung from between his lips . Get a passport for your cruise to the Greek islands , Tom thought , but this old guy was never going anywhere . Tom removed the cigarette butt and stuck a Gauloise between the man 's lips . " Have a cigarette , " Tom said . " Here 's a light . " Tom lit it quickly with his matches . " Ta , " said the man , through his beard . Tom pushed the rest of the Gauloise pack , then his matches , into the torn pocket of the overcoat , and dashed away , his head ducked , hoping no one had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they met downstairs with their luggage . " Been doing a little shopping for my wife this morning , " Murchison said in the taxi . He seemed in a good mood . " Yes ? So have I. A pair of Carnaby Street trousers . " " For Harriet , it 's Marks and Spencer sweaters . And Liberty scarves . Sometimes balls of wool . She knits , and she likes to think the wool came from old England , y'know ? " " You canceled your appointment for this morning ? " " Yep . Made it for Saturday morning . At the man 's house . " At the airport , they had a rather good lunch with a bottle of claret . Murchison insisted on paying . During lunch Murchison told Tom about his son who was an inventor working in a California laboratory . His son and daughter-in-law had just had their first baby . Murchison showed Tom a photograph of her , and laughed at himself for being a doting grandfather , but it  | was his first grandchild , named Karin after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murchison 's questions , Tom said he had chosen to live in France because he had married a French girl three years ago . Murchison was not blunt enough to ask how Tom earned his living , but he did ask how he spent his time . " I read history , " Tom said casually . " I study German . Not to mention that my French still needs work . And gardening . I 've got a pretty big garden in Villeperce . Also I paint , " he added , " just for my amusement . " They were at Orly by 3 P.M. , and Tom went off in the little GASO bus to fetch his car from the garage , and then he picked up Murchison near the taxi rank with their suitcases . The sun was shining , and it was not so cold as in England . Tom drove to Fontainebleau and went past the chateau so that Murchison could see it . Murchison said he had n't seen it in fifteen years . They reached Villeperce around 4:30 P.M. " Where we buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a store on his left on the main village street . " Very pretty . Unspoiled , " Murchison said . And when they came to Tom 's house : " Why this is terrific ! Really beautiful ! " " You should see it in summer , " Tom said , modestly . Mme. Annette , hearing the car , came out to greet them and to help with the luggage , but Murchison could not bear to see a woman carrying the heavy things , only the little bags of cigarettes and spirits . " Everything goes well , Mme. Annette ? " Tom asked . " Everything . Even the plumber came to repair the W.C. " One of the W.C.s had been dripping , Tom remembered . Tom and Annette showed Murchison up to his room which had an adjoining bath . It was actually Heloise 's bath , and her room was on the other side of the bath . Tom explained that his wife was in Greece now , with friends . He left Murchison to wash up and to open his suitcase , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murchison was already gazing with interest at some drawings on the walls . Tom went down and asked Mme. Annette to make some tea . He presented her with a bottle of eau de cologne  --  from England , " Lake Mist " ? which he had bought at Heathrow .  | " Oh , M. Tome , come vous etes gentil ! " Tom smiled . Mme. Annette always made him feel grateful for her gratitude . " Good tournedos for tonight ? " " Ah , oui ! And for dessert mousse au chocolat . " Tom went into the living room . Here were flowers , and Mme. Annette had turned up the heat . There was a fireplace , and Tom loved fires , but he felt he had to watch them constantly , or he loved watching them so much he could not tear himself away , so he decided not to light one now . He stared at Man in Chair over the fireplace , and bounced on his heels with satisfaction  --  satisfaction with its familiarity , its excellence . Bernard was good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods . Damn periods anyway . Logically , The Red Chairs , a genuine Derwatt , should have the place of honor in the room over the fireplace . Typical of him that he had put the phony in the choice spot , he supposed . Heloise did n't know that Man in Chair was bogus , and knew nothing of the Derwatt forgeries , in fact . Her interest in painting was casual . If she had any passions , they were for traveling , sampling exotic food , and buying clothes . The contents of her two closets in her room looked like an international costume museum without the dummies . She had vests from Tunisia , fringed sleeveless jackets from Mexico , Greek soldiers ' baggy pants in which she looked quite charming , and embroidered coats from China that she had bought somehow in London . Then Tom suddenly remembered Count Bertolozzi , and went to his telephone . He did n't particularly want Murchison to hear the Count 's name , but on the other hand Tom was not going to do any harm to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the good . Tom asked for inquiries for Milan , got the number , and gave it to the French operator . She told Tom the call might take half an hour . Mr. Murchison came down . He had changed his clothes , and wore gray flannel trousers and a green and black tweed jacket . " The country life ! " he said , beaming . " Ah ! " He had caught sight of The Red Chairs facing him across the room , and went over for closer inspection . " That 's a masterpiece . That 's the real McCoy ! "  | No doubt of that , Tom thought , and a thrill of pride went over him which made him feel slightly foolish . " Yes , I like it . " " I think I 've heard about it . I remember the title from somewhere . I congratulate you , Torn . " " And there 's my Man in Chair , " Tom said , nodding toward the fireplace . " Ah , " Murchison said on a different note . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sturdy figure grow tense with concentration . " And how old is this ? " " About four years old , " Tom said truthfully . " What did you pay , to ask a rude question ? " " Two thousand quid . Before devaluation . About five thousand six hundred dollars , " Tom said , calculating the pound at two eighty . " I 'm delighted to see this , " Murchison said , nodding . " You see , the same purple turns up again . Very little of it here , but look . " He pointed to the bottom edge of the chair . Due to the height of the picture and the width of the fireplace , Murchison 's finger was inches away from the canvas , but Tom knew the streak of purple that he meant . " Plain cobalt violet . " Murchison crossed the room and looked again at The Red Chairs , peering at it at a distance of ten inches . " And this is one of the old ones . Plain cobalt violet too . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , I do . Like my Clock . The quality is different . Inferior to The Red Chairs . Quality is something one ca n't measure with the aid of a microscope . But I can see it here . And  --  I 'm also sure about the plain cobalt violet here . " " Then , " Tom said in an unperturbed way , " maybe it means Derwatt is using plain cobalt violet and the mixture you mentioned  --  alternately . " Murchison , frowning , shook his head . " I do n't see it that way . " Mme. Annette was pushing the tea in on a cart . One wheel of the cart squeaked slightly . " Voila le the , M. Tome . " Mme. Annette had made flat brown-edged cookies , and they gave off a cosy smell of warm vanilla . Torn poured the tea . Murchison sat on the sofa . He might not have seen Mme. Annette come and go . He stared at Man in Chair as if dazed or fascinated . Then he blinked at Tom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't believe me , I think . That 's your privilege . " " I do n't know what to say . I do n't see the difference in quality , no . Maybe I 'm obtuse . If , as you say , you 'll get an expert to look at yours , I 'll abide by what an expert says . And by the way , Man in Chair is the picture you can take back to London with you , if you like . " " I 'd most certainly like . I 'll write you a receipt for it and even insure it for you . " Murchison chuclded . " It 's insured . Do n't worry . " Over two cups of tea , Murchison asked Tom about Heloise , and what she was doing . Had they any children ? No . Heloise was twenty-five . No , Tom did n't think Frenchwomen were more difficult than other women , but they had their own idea of the respect with which they should be treated . This subject did not make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a certain respect , and though Tom knew Heloise 's kind , he absolutely could not put it into words . The telephone rang , and Tom said , " Excuse me , I think I 'll take that up in my room . " He dashed up the stairs . After all , Murchison might suppose it was Heloise , and that he wanted to speak with her alone . " Hello ? " Tom said . " Eduardo ! How are you ? I 'm in luck to get you . . . Via the grapevine . A mutual friend in Paris rang today and told me you were in Milan . . . Now can you pay me a visit ? After all , you promised . " The Count , a bon vivant ever willing to be distracted from the swift pursuit of his business ( export-import ) showed a slight hesitation about changing his Paris plans , then agreed with enthusiasm to come to Tom . " But not tonight . Tomorrow . Is that all right ? " That was quite soon enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present . " Yes , even Saturday would be ? " " Friday , " said the Count firmly , not getting the point . " All right . I 'll pick you up at Orly . At what time ? " " My plane is at  --  just a minute . " The Count took quite a time looking it up , came back to the telephone and said , " Arriving at five fifteen . Flight three zero six Alitalia. "  | Tom wrote this down . " I 'll be there . Delighted you can come , Eduardo ! " Then Tom went back downstairs to Thomas Murchison . By now they called each other Tom , though Murchison said his wife called him Tommy . Murchison said he was an hydraulic engineer with a pipe-laying company whose main office was in New York . Murchison was one of the directors . They took a walk around Tom 's back garden , which blended into virgin woods . Tom rather liked Murchison . Surely he could persuade him , convert him , Tom thought . What should he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand-new in his plant , packaged transport by pipe of anything and everything in soup-tin-sized containers ? Tom wondered if he should bother to ask Jeff and Ed to get Mexican letterheads from some shipping company on which to list Derwatt 's paintings ? And how quickly could this be done ? Ed was the journalist , and could n't he handle a clerical job like this , and have Leonard , the gallery manager , and Jeff walk all over them on the floor to make them look five or six years old ? The dinner was excellent , and Murchison had praise for Mme. Annette , which he delivered in quite passable French , for her mousse and even the Brie . " We 'll have coffee in the living room , " Tom said to her . " And can you bring the brandy ? " Mme. Annette had lit the fire . Tom and Murchison settled themselves on the big yellow sofa . " It 's a funny thing , " Tom began , " I like Man in Chair just as much as The Red Chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " Tom was still talking in a Midwestern accent . " You can see it 's got the place of honor in the house . " " Well , you did n't know it was a forgery ! " Murchison laughed a little . " It 'd be very interesting  --  very  --  to know who 's forging . " Tom stretched his legs out in front of him and puffed on a cigar . " What a funny thing it would be , " he began , playing his last and best card , " if a forger was doing all the Buckmaster Gallery Derwatts now , all the ones we saw yesterday . Someone as good as Derwatt , in other words . "  | Murchison smiled . " Then what 's Derwatt doing ? Sitting back and taking it ? Do n't be ridiculous. ? Derwatt was much as I 'd thought he would be . Withdrawn and sort of old-fashioned . " " Have you ever thought of collecting forgeries ? I know a man in Italy who collects them . First as a hobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite high prices . " " Oh , I 've heard of that . Yes. ? But I like to know I 'm buying a forgery when I buy one . " Tom sensed that he was reaching a narrow and unpleasant spot . He tried again . " I like to daydream  --  about absurd things like that . In a sense , why disturb a forger who 's doing such good work ? I intend to hang onto Man in Chair . " Murchison might not have heard Tom 's remarks . " And you know , " Murchison said , still gazing at the picture Tom was talking about , " it 's not merely the lavender , it 's the soul of the painting . I would n't put it that way , if I were n't mellow on your good food and drink . " They had finished a delicious bottle of Margaux , the best from Tom 's cellar . " Do you think the Buckmaster Gallery people might be crooks ? " Murchison asked . " They must be . Why would they be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real ones ? " Murchison thought the other new Derwatts , all of them in the current show , except The Tub , were genuine , Tom realized . " That 's if these are really forgeries  --  your Clock and so forth . I suppose I 'm not yet convinced . " Murchison smiled with good humor . " Just because you like your Man in Chair . If your picture is four years old and mine 's at least three , these forgeries have been going on quite a while . Maybe there 're more in London that were n't lent for the show . Frankly , it 's Derwatt I suspect . I suspect him of being in cahoots with the Buckmaster people to earn more money . Another thing  --  there 've been no drawings by Derwatt for years now . That 's odd . " " Really ? " Tom asked with a feigned surprise . He knew this , and he knew what Murchison was driving at .  | " Drawings reveal an artist 's personality , " Murchison said . " I realized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to corroborate myself . " He laughed . " Just because I manufacture pipe , people never give me credit for sensitivity ! But a drawing is like a signature for a painter , a very complicated signature at that . But you might say , you can forge a signature or a painting more easily than you can forge a drawing . " " Never thought of that , " said Tom , and rolled his cigar end in the ashtray . " You say Saturday you 're going to speak to the Tate Gallery man ? " " Yes . There 're a couple of old Derwatts at the Tate , as you probably know. ? Then I 'll speak to the Buckmaster people without giving them any warning  --  if Riemer corroborates me . " Tom 's mind began to make painful leaps . Saturday was day after tomorrow . Riemer might want to compare The Clock and Man in Chair with the Tate Gallery Derwatts and those in the current show . Could Bernard Tuft 's paintings stand up to it ? And if they could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for himself which he did not want . He folded his hands on his chest . " You know , I do n't think I 'll sue-or whatever one does  --  if there 's forging going on . " " Hah ! I 'm a little more orthodox . Old-fashioned , maybe . My attitude . Suppose Derwatt 's really in on it ? " " Derwatt 's rather a saint , I hear . " " That 's the legend . He might 've been more of a saint when he was younger and poorer . He 's been in seclusion . His friends in London put him on the map , that 's plain . A lot can happen to a poor man , if he suddenly becomes rich . " Tom got no further during the evening . Mr. Murchison wanted to turn in early , because he was tired . " I 'll see about a plane in the morning . I should 've booked one in London . That was stupid of me . " " Oh , not in the morning , I hope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning . I 'll take off in the afternoon , if that 's all right with you . " Tom saw his guest up to his room , made sure he had everything he needed . It crossed his mind to ring Jeff or Ed . But what news had  | he , except that he was n't getting anywhere in trying to persuade Murchison not to see the Tate Gallery man ? And also Tom did not want Jeff 's telephone number appearing too often on his bill .  | Tom began the morning with a determined optimism . He put on old comfortable clothes  --  after having Mme. Annette 's delicious coffee in bed , one black cup to wake him up  --  and went down to see if Murchison was stirring as yet . It was a quarter to 9 . " Le m'sieur takes his breakfast in his room , " Mme. Annette said . While Mme. Annette tidied his room , Tom shaved in his bathroom . " M. Murchison is leaving this afternoon , I think , " Tom said in answer to Mme. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But today is Friday . Do you think you could catch a nice pair of soles " ? Tom gulped and thought of " shoes , skates " in English ? " from the fish merchant for lunch ? " A fish van came to the village every Friday morning . There was no fish shop in the town , because Villeperce was too small . Mme. Annette was inspired by this suggestion . " The grapes are lovely at the fruit merchant 's , " she said . " You would n't believe it . . . " " Buy some . " Tom scarcely listened to her . At 11 A.M. Tom and Murchison were walking in the woods behind Tom 's property . Tom was in an odd mood , or state  | of mind . In a burst of bare-faced friendliness , honesty , or whatever one might call it , Tom had shown Murchison his own artistic efforts in the upstairs room where he painted . Tom painted landscapes and portraits mainly . He was ever trying to simplify , to keep the example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought . One portrait of Heloise , possibly Tom 's twelfth , was not bad , and Murchison had praised it . My God , Tom thought , I 'll lay my soul bare , show him the poems I 've written to Heloise , take my clothes off and do a sword dance if he 'll only  --  see things my way ! It was of no use . Murchison 's plane was at 4 P.M. for London . Time for a decent lunch here , as Orly was about an hour away by car under good conditions . While Murchison had been changing his shoes for their little walk , Tom had wrapped Man in Chair in three thicknesses of corrugated paper , string , brown paper and more string . Murchison was going to keep the painting with him in the overhead rack on the plane , he had told Tom . Murchison said he had reserved a room at the Mandeville for this evening . " But remember , no charges pressed on my part , " Tom said , " about Man in Chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a fake , " Murchison said with a smile . " You 're not going to insist it 's genuine ? " " No , " Tom said . " Touche . I 'll bow to the experts . " The open woods was not the place for a conversation which had to get down to a pinpoint , Tom felt . Or did it have to expand into a huge gray cloud ? Tom was not happy , at any rate , talking to Murchison in the woods . Tom had asked Mme. Annette to prepare the lunch rather early , because of M. Murchison 's departure , and they began at a quarter to i . Tom was determined to keep the conversation on the subject , because he did not want to abandon all hope . He brought up Van Meegeren , with whose career Murchison was acquainted . Van Meegeren 's forgeries of Vermeer had finally achieved some value of their own . Van Meegeren may have stated it first in self-defense , in bravado , but aesthetically there was no doubt that Van Meegeren 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people who had bought them .  | " I can not understand your total disconnection with the truth of things , " Murchison said . " An artist 's style is his truth , his honesty . Has another man the right to copy it , in the same way that a man copies another man 's signature ? And for the same purpose , to draw on his reputation , his bank account ? A reputation already built by a man 's talent ? " They were chasing the last morsels of sole and butter around their plates , with the last morsels of potato . The sole had been superb , the white wine still was . It was the kind of lunch that under any other circumstances would have given contentment , even happiness , would have inspired lovers to go to bed  --  perhaps after coffee  --  and make love and then sleep . The beauty of the lunch was today wasted on Tom . " I speak for myself , " Tom said . " I usually do . I do n't mean to influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have my permission to say to ? Who is it , Mr. Constant , yes , that I 'm rather happy with my forgery and I want to keep it . " " I 'll tell him that . But do n't you think of the future ? If there 's somebody continuing to do this ? " There was a lemon souffle . Tom struggled . He was convinced . Why could n't he put it into words , put it well enough to convince Murchison ? Murchison was not artistic . Or he would n't be talking like this . Murchison did n't appreciate Bernard . What the hell was Murchison doing dragging in truth and signatures and possibly even the police , compared to what Bernard was doing in his studio , which was undeniably the work of a fine painter ? How had Van Meegeren put it ( or had Tom himself put it that way , in one of his notebooks ) , " An artist does things naturally , without effort . Some power guides his hand . A forger struggles , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom realized it was his own paraphrase . But goddam it , that smug Murchison , holier-than thou ! At least Bernard was a man of talent , of more talent than Murchison with his plumbing , his pipe-laying , his packaging of transportable items , an idea which anyway had come from a young engineer in Canada , Murchison had said . Coffee . Neither took brandy , though the bottle was at hand . Thomas Murchison 's face , full of flesh , somewhat ruddy  --  his  | face might have been stone to Tom . Murchison 's eyes were bright , quite intelligent , and against him . It was I:30 . They were to leave for Orly in half an hour or so . Should he go back to London as soon as possible after the Count left , Tom wondered ? But what could he accomplish in London ? Damn the Count , Tom thought . Derwatt , Ltd. was more important than the crap or the trinket that the Count was carrying . Tom realized that Reeves had not told him where to look in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed Reeves would telephone this evening . Tom felt wretched , and he simply had to move , now , from the chair where he had been squirming for the past ten minutes . " I wanted you to take a bottle of wine from my cellar , " Tom said . " Shall we go down and have a look ? " Murchison 's smile became broader . " What a marvelous idea ! Thank you , Tom . " The cellar was approachable from outdoors , down a few stone steps to a green door , or via a door in a downstairs spare loo , next to a little hall where guests hung their coats . Tom and Heloise had had the indoor stairs put in to avoid going outdoors in bad weather . " I 'll take the wine back to the States with me . It 'd be a pity to crack it by myself in London , " Murchison said . Tom put on the light in the cellar . The cellar was big , gray , and as cool as a refrigerator , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were five or six big barrels on stands , not all of them full , and many racks of wine bottles against all the walls . In one corner was the big fuel storage tank for the heating , and another tank that held hot water . " Here are the clarets , " Tom said , indicating a wall of wine racks which were more than half full of dusty dark bottles . Murchison whistled appreciatively . It 's got to be down here , Tom thought , if anything has to be done . Yet he had not planned nearly enough , he had not planned anything . Keep moving , he told himself , but all he did was stroll about slowly , looking over his bottles , touching one or two of the red-tinfoil wrapped necks . He pulled one out . " Margaux . You liked that . "  | " Superb , " Murchison said . " Thank you very much , Tom . I 'll tell the folks about the cellar it came from . " Murchison took the bottle reverently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind  --  just for the sake of sportsmanship  --  about speaking to the expert in London . About the forgeries . " Murchison laughed a little . " Tom , I ca n't . Sportsmanship ! I ca n't for the life of me see why you want to protect them , unless ? " Murchison had had a thought , and Tom knew what that thought was , that Tom Ripley was in on it , deriving some kind of benefit or profit from it . " Yes , I have an interest in it , " Torn said quickly . " You see , I know the young man who spoke to you in your hotel the other day . I know all about him . He 's the forger . " " What ? That  --  that ? " " Yes , that nervous fellow . Bernard . He knew Derwatt . It started out quite idealistically , you see ? " " You mean , Derwatt knows about it ? " " Derwatt is dead . They got someone to impersonate him . " Tom blurted it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maybe something to gain . Murchison had his life to gain , but Tom could not quite put that into words , not plain words , as yet . " So Derwatt 's dead  --  since how long ? " " Five or six years . He really died in Greece . " " So all the pictures ? " " Bernard Tufts ? You saw what kind of fellow he is . He 'd commit suicide if it came out he was forging his dead friend 's paintings . He told you not to buy any more . Is n't that enough ? The gallery asked Bernard to paint a couple of pictures in Derwatt 's style , you see ? " Torn realized he had suggested that , but no matter . Tom also realized that he was arguing hopelessly , not only because Murchison was adamant , but because there was a split in Tom 's own reasoning , a split he was well acquainted with . He saw the right and the wrong . Yet both sides of himself were equally sincere : save Bernard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom was arguing . Murchison would never understand . " Bernard wants out of it ,  | I know . I do n't think you 'd like to risk a man 's killing himself out of shame just to prove a point , would you ? " " He might 've thought of shame when he began ! " Murchison looked at Tom 's hands , his face , back to his hands again . " Was it you impersonating Derwatt ? Yes . I noticed Derwatt 's hands . " Murchison smiled bitterly . " And people think I do n't notice little things ! " " You 're very observant , " Tom said quickly . He suddenly felt angry . " My God , I might 've mentioned it yesterday . I thought of it yesterday . Your hands . You ca n't put a beard on those , can you ? " Tom said , " Let them all alone , would you ? Are they doing much harm ? Bernard 's pictures are good , you ca n't deny that . " " I 'm damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ! Not even if you or anybody else offers me a whacking lot of money to keep my mouth shut ! " Murchison 's face was redder , and his jowls trembled . He set the wine down rather hard on the floor , but it did n't break . The rejection of his wine was a slight insult , or so Tom felt now , a minuscule but further insult and annoyance . Tom picked up the bottle almost at once and swung it at Murchison , hitting him on the side of the head . This time the bottle broke , wine splashed , and the base of the bottle fell to the floor . Murchison reeled against the wine racks , jiggling it all , but nothing else fell , except Murchison , who slumped down , bumping wine bottle tops but not disturbing any . Tom seized the first thing to hand  --  which happened to be an empty coal scuttle ? and swung it at Murchison 's head . Tom struck a second blow . The base of the scuttle was heavy . Murchison was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the stone floor . He was n't moving . What to do about the blood ? Tom turned around in circles , looking for an old rag anywhere , even newspaper . He went over to the fuel tank . Under the tank was a large rag , stiff with age and dirt . He went back with it and mopped , but gave up the useless task after a moment , and looked around again . Put him under a barrel , he thought . He grabbed Murchison by the ankles , then at once dropped the ankles and felt of  | Murchison 's neck . There seemed to be no pulse . Tom took a huge breath , and got his hands under Murchison 's arms . He pulled and jerked , dragging the heavy body toward the barrel . The corner behind the barrel was dark . Murchison 's feet stuck out a little . Tom bent Murchison 's knees so that the feet did not show . But since the barrel stood some sixteen inches above the floor on its stand , Murchison was more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cellar and looked into that particular corner . By stooping , one had a view of Murchison 's whole body . Of all times , Tom thought , not to find an old sheet , a piece of tarpaulin , newspaper , anything to cover something up with ! That was Mme. Annette 's tidiness ! Tom tossed the bloodstained rag , and it landed on Murchison 's feet . He kicked at a couple of pieces of broken bottle on the floor  --  the wine had mingled with the blood now  --  then quickly picked up the neck of the bottle , and hit the light bulb which hung on a cord from the ceiling . The bulb broke and tinkled to the floor . Then , gasping a little , trying to get his breathing back to normal , Tom moved in the darkness toward the stairs and climbed them . He closed the cellar door . The spare john had a basin , and here he washed his hands quickly . Some blood showed pink in the running water , and Tom thought it was Murchison 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had a cut at the base of his thumb . But it was n't a bad cut , it could have been worse , so he considered himself lucky . He pulled toilet paper from the roll on the wall and wrapped it around his thumb . Mme. Annette was busy in the kitchen now , which was another piece of luck . If she came out , Tom thought , he would say that M. Murchison was already in the car  --  in case Mme. Annette asked where he was . It was time to go . Tom ran up to Murchison 's room . The only things Murchison had not packed were his topcoat and toilet articles in the loo . Tom put the toilet articles into a pocket of Murchison 's suitcase and closed it . Then he carried the suitcase and the topcoat down the stairs and out the front door . He put these things into the Alfa-Romeo , then ran back upstairs for Murchison 's Clock , which was still wrapped . Murchison had been so sure  | of himself , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chair . Pride goeth before a fall , Tom thought . He took his wrapped Man in Chair from Murchison 's room into his own room , and stuck it in a back corner of his closet , then carried The Clock downstairs . He grabbed his raincoat from a hook outside the spare loo , and went out to the car . He drove off for Orly . Murchison 's passport and airline ticket might be in the pocket of his jacket , Tom thought . He would take care of that later , burn them preferably , when Mme. Annette was out of the house in the morning on her usual leisurely shopping tour . It also occurred to Tom that he had not told Mme. Annette about the Count 's arrival . Tom would ring her from somewhere , but not from Orly Airport , he thought , because he did not want to linger there . The time was right , as if Murchison were actually going to make his plane . Tom made for the departures doorway . Here taxis and private cars , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposit luggage and people or pick them up . Tom stopped , got Murchison 's suitcase out , and set it on the pavement , then set The Clock against the suitcase , and laid Murchison 's coat on top . Tom drove off . There were a few other little assemblies of luggage on the pavement , he noticed . He drove out in the Fontainebleau direction , and stopped at a roadside bar-cafe , one of many medium-sized bar-cafes along the route between Orly and the beginning of the Autoroute du Sud . He ordered a beer , and asked for a jeton to make a telephone call . No jeton was necessary , so Tom took the telephone on the bar near the cash register , and dialed the number of his house . " Hello , it 's me , " said Tom . " M. Murchison had to hurry at the last moment , so he asked me to tell you good-bye and to thank you . " " Oh , I understand . " " Alors  --  there is another guest coming this evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him at Orly , and we 'll be home before six . Now can you buy perhaps some  --  calves ' liver ? "  | " The butcher at the moment has beautiful gigot ! " Tom was not in the mood for anything with a bone in it , somehow . " If it is not too much trouble , I think I prefer calves ' liver . " " And a Margaux ? A Meursault ? " " Leave the wine to me . " Tom paid  --  he said he had telephoned Sens , which was farther than his village  --  and went out to his car . He drove at a leisurely speed back to Orly , past the arrivals and departures section , and noticed that Murchison 's things were still where he had left them . The coat would be the first to go , Tom thought , nicked by some enterprising young man . And if Murchison 's passport were in the topcoat , the nicker might turn it to some advantage . Tom smiled a little as he drove into P-4 , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass doors which opened before him , bought a Neue Ziiricher Zeitztng at the newsstand , then checked on the arrival time of Eduardo 's plane . The flight was on time , and he had a few minutes to spare . Tom went to the crowded bar  --  it was always crowded  --  and at last got an elbow in and managed to order a coffee . After the coffee , he bought a ticket and went up to where people met the arrivals . The Count was wearing a gray homburg . He had a long thin black moustache and a bulging abdomen , which was visible even under his unbuttoned topcoat . The Count broke into a smile , a real spontaneous Italian smile , and he waved a greeting . The Count was presenting his passport . Then they were shaking hands , giving each other a quick embrace , and Tom helped him with packages and carryalls . The Count had also an attache case . What was the Count carrying , and where ? His suitcase was not even opened , only motioned through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here a minute , I 'll fetch my car , " Tom said when they were on the pavement . " It 's just a few yards away . " Tom went off at a trot , and was back in five minutes . He had to drive past the departures gate , and he noticed that Murchison 's suitcase and painting were still there , but the coat was gone . One down and two to go .  | On the drive homeward , they discussed , not very profoundly , Italian politics , French politics of the moment , and the Count inquired about Heloise . Tom scarcely knew the Count , and thought this was the second time they had seen each other , but in Milan they had talked about painting , which was a passionate interest of the Count . " At the moment , there is an esposizione of Derwatt in London . I look forward to that next week . And what do you think of Derwatt coming to London ? I was astound ! The first photographs of him in years ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A big surprise . He has n't changed much , they say . " Tom was not going to mention that he had been recently in London and had seen the show . " I look forward to seeing your picture at home . What is it ? The one with the little girls ? " " The Red Chairs , " Tom said , surprised that the Count remembered . He smiled and gripped the wheel tighter . Despite the corpse in the cellar , despite the ghastly day , the nerveracking afternoon , Tom was going to be very happy to get back home  --  to the scene of the crime , as they said . Tom did n't feel that it was a crime . Or was he due for a delayed reaction tomorrow , even tonight ? He hoped not . " Italy is producing worse espresso . In the cafes , " the Count announced in a solemn baritone . " I am convince . Probably some Mafia business at the bottom of it . " He mused sourly out the window for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy , my goodness ! I begin to wonder if I know my own country ! Now in my old favorite barbershop off the Via Veneto , they have new young men who ask me what kind of shampoo I want . I say , Just wash my hair , please ? what 's left of it ! But is it oily or dry , signor ? We have three kinds of shampoo . Have you dandruff ? ' No ! ' I say . Ca n't somebody have normal hair these days , or does ordinary shampoo exist any more ? ' " Like Murchison , the Count praised the sturdy symmetry of Belle Ombre . The garden , though there was hardly a rose left from summer , showed its handsome rectangular lawn surrounded by thick and formidable pines . It was home , and not  | exactly humble . Again Mme. Annette met them on the doorstep , and was as helpful and welcoming as yesterday when Thomas Murchison had arrived . Again Tom showed his guest to his room , which Mme. Annette had made ready . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be downstairs when the Count wished to join him . Dinner was at 8 . Then Tom unwrapped Man in Chair in his room , and took it downstairs and hung it in its usual place . Mme. Annette might well have noticed its absence for a few hours , but if she asked him anything about it , Tom intended to say that Mr. Murchison had taken it to his room , Tom 's , to look at under a different light . Tom parted the heavy red curtains of the french windows , and looked at his back garden . The dark green shadows were becoming black with the fall of night . Tom realized he was standing directly over Murchison in the cellar , and he edged away . He must , even if it had to be late tonight , go down and do what he could about cleaning up the wine and blood stains . Mme. Annette might have a reason to go to the cellar : she kept a good eye on the fuel supply . And then , how to get the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toolshed . Could he wheel Murchison  --  covered by a tarpaulin which was in the toolshed also  --  into the woods behind the house and bury him ? Primitive , unpleasantly close to the house , but it might be the best solution . The Count came down , spry and bouncing in spite of his bulk . He was a rather tall man . " A-hah ! A-hah ! " Like Murchison he was struck by The Red Chairs which hung on the other side of the room . But the Count turned at once , and looked toward the fireplace , and seemed even more impressed by Man in Chair . " Lovely ! Delicious ! " He peered at both pictures . " You did not disappoint me . They are a pleasure . So is your entire house . I mean the drawings in my room . " Mme. Annette came in with the ice bucket and some glasses on the bar cart . The count , seeing Pont y Mes , said he would have that . " Did the gallery in London ask you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murchison had asked that question twenty-four hours ago , but about Man in Chair only , and had asked it because he was curious about the gallery 's attitude to paintings they must know to be forgeries . Tom felt a little dizzy in the head , as if he were going to faint . He had been bending over the bar cart , and now he straightened up . " They did . But it 's such trouble , you know , shipping and insuring . I lent The Red Chairs for a show two years ago . " " I may buy a Derwatt , " said the Count thoughtfully . " That is if I can afford one . It will have to be a small one , at his prices . " Tom poured a straight scotch on ice for himself . The telephone rang . " Excuse me , " Tom said , and answered it . Eduardo was walking about , looking at other things on the walls . It was Reeves Minot . He asked if the Count had arrived , then if Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's in the ? " " I ca n't quite hear . " " Toothpaste , " Reeves said . " O-oh . " It was almost a groan from Tom , of fatigue , contempt , boredom even . Was this a child 's game ? Or something in a lousy film ? " Very good . And the address ? Same as last time ? " Tom had an address in Paris , three or four actually , where he had sent Reeves ' items on other occasions . " That 'll do . The last one. ? Is everything all right ? " " Yes , I think so , thank you , " Tom said pleasantly . He might have suggested Reeves have a word with the Count , just to be friendly , but it was probably better the Count did n't know that Reeves had rung . Tom felt quite off his form , off on the wrong foot . " Thanks for ringing . " " No need to ring me if everything 's okay , " said Reeves and hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eduardo , " Tom said , and ran upstairs . He went into the Count 's room . One of his suitcases was open on the antique wood-box where guests and Mme. Annette  | usually put suitcases , but Tom looked first in the bathroom . The Count had not put out his toilet articles . Tom went to the suitcase and found an opaque plastic bag with a zipper . He tried this and ran into tobacco . There was another plastic bag in which were shaving gear , toothbrush and toothpaste , and he took the toothpaste . The end of the rube was a little rough , but sealed . Reeves ' man probably had some kind of clamp with which to seal the metal again . Tom squeezed the tube cautiously and felt a hard lump near the end of it . He shook his head in disgust , pocketed the toothpaste , replaced the plastic kit . He went to his own room and put the toothpaste at the back of his top left drawer which contained a stud box and a lot of starched collars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about Derwatt 's surprising return , and his interview which the Count had read in the press . " He 's living in Mexico , is n't he ? " Tom asked . " Yes . And he wo n't say where . Like B. Traven , you know . Ha ! Ha ! " The Count praised the dinner and ate heartily . He had the European faculty of being able to talk with his mouth full , which no American could manage without looking or feeling extremely messy . After dinner , the Count , seeing Tom 's gramophone , expressed a desire for some music , and chose Pelleas et Melisande . The Count wanted the third act  --  the duet , somewhat hectic , between soprano and deep male voice . While listening , even singing along , the Count managed to talk . Tom tried to pay attention to the Count and to exclude the music , but Tom always found it hard to exclude music . He was in no mood for Pelleas et Melisande . What he needed was the music from A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now as the other thing played on with its heavy drama , Mendelssohn 's overture danced in Tom 's inner ear ? nervous , comic , full of invention . He desperately needed to be full of invention . They were dipping into the brandy . Tom suggested that tomorrow morning they might take a drive and lunch at Moretsur-Loing . Eduardo had said he wanted to take an afternoon  | train to Paris . But first he wanted to make sure he had seen all Tom 's art treasures , so Tom took him on a tour of the house . Even in Heloise 's room , there was a Laurencin . Then they said good night , and Eduardo retired with a couple of Tom 's art books . In his room , Tom got the tube of Vademecum toothpaste from his drawer , tried to open the bottom with a thumbnail , and failed . He went into the room where he painted , and got some pliers from his worktable . Back in his room , he cut the tube open , and out came a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it could survive rinsing , decided against it , and merely wiped the thing with a Kleenex . It smelled of peppermint . He addressed an envelope to : M. Jean-Marc Cahannier 16 Rue de Tison Paris IX then put the cylinder into a couple of sheets of writing paper and stuck it all into the envelope . Tom swore to himself to pull out of this silly business , because it was degrading . He could tell Reeves without offending him . Reeves had a strange idea that the more an item changed hands , the safer it was . Reeves was fence-minded . But surely he lost money paying everybody , even paying them a little bit . Or did some people take it out in favors asked from Reeves ? Tom got into pajamas and dressing gown , looked into the hall , and was gratified to see that there was no light showing under Eduardo 's door . He went quietly down to the kitchen . There were two doors between the kitchen and Mme. Annette 's bedroom , because there was a little hall with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not likely to hear him or see the kitchen light . Tom got a sturdy gray cleaning rag and a container of Ajax , took a light bulb from a cabinet and put it in a pocket . He went down to the cellar . He shivered . Now he realized he had to have a torch and a chair to stand on , so he went back to the kitchen and took one of the wooden stools that belonged to the kitchen table , and picked up a torch from the hall table drawer .  | He held the torch under his arm , and removed the shattered bulb and put in the new one . The cellar lit up . Murchison 's shoes still showed . Then Tom realized to his horror that the legs had straightened with rigor mortis . Or he was n't possibly still alive ? Tom forced himself to make sure , or he knew he would n't be able to sleep that night . Tom put the back of his fingers against Murchison 's hand . That was enough . Murchison 's hand was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Murchison 's shoes . There was a sink with cold water in a corner . Tom wet his cleaning rag and got to work . Some color came off on the rag , which he washed out , but he could not see much improvement in the color of the floor , though the dark of it might be due to its wetness now . Well , he could say to Mme. Annette that he dropped a bottle of wine , in case she asked anything . Tom got up the last fragments of broken light bulb and wine bottle , rinsed the rag out in the sink cautiously , recovered the pieces of glass from the sink 's drain , and put them into his dressing gown pocket . He again worked on the floor with the rag . Then he went back upstairs , and in the better light of the kitchen made sure that the reddish tint in the rag was gone or almost gone . He laid the rag over the drainpipe under the sink . But the blasted body . Tom sighed , and thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eduardo off , but would n't this look pretty strange if Mme. Annette wanted to go in ? And she had her own key , and one to the outside door as well , which had a different lock . Tom took the precaution of bringing up a bottle of rose and two of Margaux , and put them on the kitchen table . There were times when having a servant was annoying . When Tom went to bed , more tired than the night before , he thought of putting Murchison into a barrel . But it would take a cooper to get the damned hoops back on it properly , he supposed . And Murchison would have to be in liquid of some sort or he would bump around in an empty barrel . And how could he manage Murchison 's weight in a barrel by himself ? Impossible . Tom thought of Murchison 's suitcase and The Clock at Orly . Surely someone had removed them by now . Murchison would  | perhaps have an address book , some old envelope in his suitcase . By tomorrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day after tomorrow . The Tate Gallery man was expecting Murchison tomorrow morning . Tom wondered if Murchison had told anyone that he was going to stay with Tom Ripley ? Tom hoped not .  | Saturday was sunny and cool , though not cool enough to be called crisp . Tom and Eduardo breakfasted in the living room near the french windows through which the sun came . The Count was in pajamas and dressing gown , which he would not be wearing , he said , if there were a lady in the house , but he hoped Tom did not mind . A little after io A.M. , the Count went up to dress , and came downstairs with his suitcases , ready to take off for a drive before lunch . " I wonder if I can borrow some toothpaste , " said Eduardo . " I think I forgot mine in my hotel in Milano . Very stupid of me . " Tom had been expecting the Count to ask this , and was rather glad that he had , at last . Tom went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since the Count 's toilet kit was in his suitcase downstairs , Tom supposed , Tom thought it best to show him the spare loo with the basin . Mme. Annette brought some toothpaste to him . The post arrived , and Tom excused himself to glance at it . A postcard from Heloise , saying nothing really . And another letter from Christopher Greenleaf . Tom tore this open . It said :  | Oct. 16 , I9 Dear Mr. Ripley , I just found out I can get a charter flight to Paris so I am coming earlier than I thought . I hope you are home just now . I am flying with a friend , Gerald Hayman , also my age , but I assure you I will not bring him to meet you because that might be a drag although he 's a nice fellow . I am arriving in Paris Sun . loth Oct. and will try to call you . Of course I will spend Sunday night in a Paris hotel somewhere , as the plane gets in 7 p.m . French time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tomorrow . At least Chris was n't going to arrive here tomorrow . Good God , Tom thought , all he needed now was for Bernard to turn up . Tom thought of asking Mme. Annette not to answer the telephone for the next two days , but that would seem strange , and would furthermore annoy Mme. Annette who received at least one telephone call a day from one of her friends , usually Mme. Yvonne , another housekeeper in the village . " Bad news ? " asked Eduardo . " Oh , no , not in the least , " Tom replied . He had to get Murchison 's body out . Preferably tonight . And of course he could put Chris off , tell him he was busy at least until Tuesday , Tom had a vision of French police walking in tomorrow , looking for Murchison , and finding him within seconds in the most logical place , the cellar . Tom went into the kitchen to say good-bye to Mme. Annette . She was polishing a big silver tureen and a lot of soup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PFP . " I 'm off for a little tour . M. the Count is leaving . Shall I bring anything back for the house ? " " If you find some really fresh parsley , M. Tome ? " " I 'll remember it . Persil . I shall return before 5 o'clock , I think . Dinner tonight by myself . Something simple . "  | " Shall I help with the valises ? " Mme. Annette stood up . " I do n't know where my mind is today . " Torn assured her it was not necessary , but she came out to say good-bye to the Count  --  who bowed to her and paid compliments in French on her cooking . They drove to Nemours , looked at the marketplace with its fountain , then went northward along the Loing to Moret , whose one-way streets Tom negotiated very knowledgeably now . The town had splendid gray stone towers , formerly the town gates , on both sides of the bridge over the river . The Count was enchanted . " It is not so dusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best not to appear nervous during their slow lunch , and he gazed frequently out the window at the weeping willows on the river bank , wishing he could achieve within himself the easy rhythm of their branches that the breeze swung this way and that . The Count told a very long story of his daughter 's second marriage to a young man of a titled family who had for a while been disowned by his Bologna family for marrying a girl who had been once married . Tom barely hung onto this story , because he was thinking about disposing of Murchison . Should he risk trying to dump him in some river ? Could he manage Murchison 's weight over a bridge parapet , plus the weight of stones ? And not be seen ? If he simply dragged him down the bank of a river , could he be sure Murchison would sink deep enough , even weighted ? It had begun to rain slightly . That would make the earth easier to dig , Tom thought . The woods behind the house might be the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had only a ten-minute wait for his train to Paris . When he and Tom had said an affectionate good-bye , Tom drove to the nearest tabac and bought an excess of stamps to put on his envelope to Reeves ' man , so that it would not be stopped by some petty post office clerk for want of five centimes . Tom bought parsley for Mme. Annette . Persil , French . Petersilia , German . Prezzemolo , Italian . Tom then drove homeward . The sun was setting . Tom wondered if a torch or any kind of light in the woods would attract Mme. Annette 's at-  | tention if she looked out the window of her bathroom , which gave on the back garden ? If she would come up to his room ( and find him gone ) to tell him she had seen a light in the woods ? The woods were never visited by anybody that Tom knew of , neither picknickers nor mushroom-gatherers . Tom intended to go some distance into the woods , however , and perhaps Mme. Annette would not notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a compulsion to put on levis at once and get the wheelbarrow out of the toolshed . He rolled the wheelbarrow near the stone steps that led down from the back terrace . Then since there was still enough light , he trotted across the lawn to the shed again . If Mme. Annette noticed anything , he would say that he was considering making a compost heap in the woods . Mme. Annette 's light was on in her bathroom , which had a clouded glass window , and he supposed she was taking her bath , as she did at this hour if there was not too much to do in the kitchen . Tom got a four-pronged fork from the shed and took it to the woods . He was in search of a likely spot , and hoped to start a hole which would give him a bit of cheer when he really had to finish the job tomorrow , very early tomorrow morning . He found a place among a few slender trees , where hopefully there would not be too many big roots to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best spot , even though it was only some eighty yards from the edge of the woods , where his lawn began . Tom dug vigorously , releasing some of the nervous energy that had bothered him all day . Next the garbage , he thought , and he stopped , panting , laughing out loud as he turned his face up to gulp air . Collect the potato peelings in the garbage bin now , and apple cores , and stick them all in with Murchison ? And a big sprinkling of the powder that started the decomposition ? There was a sack of it in the kitchen . Now it was rather dark . Tom went back with his fork , replaced it in the toolshed , and seeing that Mme. Annette 's bathroom light was still on  --  it was only 7 ? Tom went down to the cellar . Now he had more courage to touch Murchison , or the thing as they called it ,  | and he reached at once into the inside pocket of Murchison 's jacket . Tom was curious about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wallet , and two business cards fell out of it onto the floor . Tom hesitated , then shoved the wallet , with the cards replaced in it , back into the pocket . A side pocket of the jacket held a key on a ring , which Tom left . The other pocket , on which Murchison was lying , was more difficult , as Murchison was stiff as a piece of sculpture and seemed to weigh nearly as much . The left pocket yielded nothing . The trousers pockets had only some French coins mixed with English , which Tom let remain . Tom also left Murchison 's two rings on his fingers . If Murchison was going to be found on his grounds , there would be no doubt who he was : Mme. Annette had met him . Tom left the cellar and turned out the light at the top of the stairs . Then Tom took a bath , and had just finished when the telephone rang . Tom lunged for it , hoping , expecting it was Jeff , perhaps with good news  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tome ! Jacqueline here . How are you ? " It was one of their neighbors , Jacqueline Berthelin , who with her husband Vincent lived in a town eight kilometers away . She wanted him to come for dinner Thursday . She was having les Clegg , a middle-aged English couple whom Tom knew , who lived near Melun . " You know , my dear , it 's bad luck for me . I have a guest coming . A young man from America . " " Bring him . He is welcome . " Tom tried to get out of it and could n't completely . He said he would ring back in a couple of days and let her know , because he was not sure how long his American friend would be staying . Tom was leaving his room when the telephone rang again . This time it was Jeff , ringing from the Strand Palace Hotel , he said . " How are things there ? " " Oh , all right , thanks , " Tom said with a smile , and pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't care less that there was a corpse in his cellar , a man Tom had killed for the protection of Derwatt , Ltd . " And how are things with you ? " " Where is Murchison ? Is he still with you ? "  | " He left yesterday afternoon for London . But  --  I do n't think he 's going to talk to  --  you know , the Tate Gallery man . I 'm sure of it . " " You persuaded him ? " " Yes , " Tom said . Jeff 's sigh , or gasp of relief , was audible across the Channel . " Super , Tom . You 're a genius . " " Tell them to calm down there . Especially Bernard . " " Well  --  that 's our problem . Sure , I 'll tell him , with pleasure . He 's  --  he 's depressed . We 're trying to get him to go somewhere , Malta , any damned place until the show 's over . He 's always like this with a show , but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's he doing ? " " Moping , frankly . We even rang up Cynthia  --  who still sort of likes him , I thought . Not that we told her about  --  about this scare , " Jeff hastened to add . " We just asked her if she could spend some time with Bernard . " " I gather she said no . " " Right . " " Does Bernard know you spoke with her ? " " Ed told him . I know , Tom , maybe it was a mistake . " Tom was impatient . " Will you just keep Bernard quiet for a few days ? " " We 're giving him sedatives , mild ones . I slipped one in his tea this afternoon . " " Would you tell him Murchison is  --  sedated ? " Jeff laughed . " Yes , Tom . What 's he going to do in London ? " " He said he had some things to do there . Then he 's going back to the States. ? Listen , Jeff , no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure I 'm going to be home , anyway . " Tom thought he could explain the few telephone calls he had made to Jeff , or received from Jeff , if the police bothered to look for them : he had considered buying The Tub , and had spoken to the Buckmaster Gallery about it . That evening Tom went out to the tool shed and brought back a tarpaulin and a rope . While Mme. Annette tidied in the kitchen , Tom wrapped Murchison 's body and tied the rope so he could get a grip on it . The corpse was unwieldy , re-  | sembling a tree trunk and weighing more , Tom thought . He dragged it to the cellar steps . The fact that the body was covered made him feel slightly better , but now its nearness to the door , the steps , the front door , exacerbated his nerves all over again . What could he say if Mme. Annette saw him , if one of the eternal doorbell-ringers  --  a Gypsy selling baskets , Michel the town handyman asking if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic pamphlets  --  what would he say about the monstrous object that he was about to load on the wheelbarrow ? People might not ask about it , but they would stare , and make a typical French comment in the negative : " Not a very light weight , is it ? " And they would remember . Tom slept badly , and was curiously aware of his own snoring . He never quite fell asleep , so it was easy for him to get up at 5 A.M. Downstairs , he pushed aside the mat before the front door , then went down to the cellar . Murchison went up half the steps very nicely , but Tom had spent a lot of energy on it , and had to pause . The rope was cutting his hands a bit , and he was too impatient to run to the toolshed for his gardening gloves . He took another grip and made it to the top . It was easier going across the marble floor . He varied his task by rolling the wheelbarrow round to the front and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get Murchison out via the french windows , but he could n't cross the living room with him without taking up the rug . Now Tom pulled the elongated lump , down the four or five outside steps . He tried to put the thing sufficiently into the wheelbarrow , so that if he lifted one side of the wheelbarrow , he could right it . He did this , but the wheelbarrow tipped all the way over and spilled Murchison out the other side onto the ground again . It was almost funny . The thought of having to drag the corpse back into the cellar was awful . Unthinkable . Tom spent a moment , thirty seconds , trying to recover his energies , staring at the damned thing on the ground . Then he flung himself at it as if it were a live , screaming dragon , or something supernatural that he had to kill before it killed him , and hoisted it into the upright barrow . The front wheel of the barrow sank into the gravel . Tom knew at once it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit soft from yesterday 's showers . Torn ran and opened the big gates of his home . There were irregular flagstones between front steps and gate , and this went quite well , and then the wheelbarrow was on the hard sandy ground of the road . A lane to Tom 's right led to the woods behind his house , a narrow lane that was more of a footpath or a way for carts than cars , though it was just wide enough for a car . Tom steered the barrow round little holes and puddles in the lane , and eventually he reached his woods  --  not his , certainly , but he rather felt they were his now , he was so glad to reach the concealment they offered . Tom pushed the barrow some distance , then stopped and looked for the place where he had started to dig . He soon found it . There was a slope from the lane up to the woods , which Tom had not reckoned on , so he had to dump the corpse in the lane and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the woods , so in case anyone passed along the lane , the wheelbarrow would n't be seen . By now there was a bit more light . Tom went off at a trot toward the tool shed for the fork . He also took a shovel  --  rusted , left behind by somebody when he and Heloise had bought the house . The shovel had a hole in it , but would still be of help . Tom went back and continued his digging . He struck roots . After fifteen minutes , it became obvious that he could not finish the hole that morning . By 8:30 , Mme. Annette would come upstairs to his bedroom with his coffee , for one thing . Tom ducked as a man in faded blue came walking along the lane , pushing a wooden home-made wheelbarrow full of firewood . The man did not glance Tom 's way . He was walking toward the road that ran in front of Tom 's house . Where had he come from ? Maybe he was pinching state wood , and was as glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom dug until the trench was nearly four feet deep , traversed by roots that would take a saw to cut . Then he climbed out and looked around for a slope , any depression in which to hide Murchison temporarily . Tom found one fifteen feet away , and dragged the corpse by the ropes once more . He covered the gray tarpaulin with fallen branches and leaves . At  | least it would not catch the eye of someone in the lane , he thought . Then he pushed the now feather-light barrow onto the lane , and for good measure returned the barrow to the shed , so that Mme. Annette would not ask him a question about it if she saw it out . He had to enter by the front door , because the french windows were locked . His forehead was wet with sweat . Upstairs , he wiped himself with a hot wet towel , got back into pajamas and went to bed . It was twenty to 8 . He had done too much for Derwatt , Ltd. , he thought . Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could get Bernard past this crise . But that was n't the way to look at it . He would n't have killed someone just to save Derwatt , Ltd. or even Bernard , Tom i supposed . Tom had killed Murchison because Murchison had realized , in the cellar , that he had impersonated Derwatt . Tom had killed Murchison to save himself . And yet , Tom tried to ask himself , had he intended to kill Murchison anyway when they went down to the cellar together ? Had he not intended to kill him ? Tom simply could not answer that . And did it matter , much ? Bernard was the only one of the trio whom he could not understand perfectly , and yet Tom liked Bernard best . The motive of Ed and Jeff was so simple , to make money . Tom doubted that Cynthia had done the breaking off with Bernard . It would not have surprised Tom if Bernard ( who certainly at one point had been in love with Cynthia ) had broken it off , because he was ashamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernard out about this some time . Yes , in Bernard there was a mystery , and it was mystery that made people attractive , Tom thought , that caused people to fall in love , too . Despite the ugly , tarpaulin-bound lump in the woods behind his house , Tom felt his own thoughts bearing him away as if he were on a cloud . It was strange , and exceedingly pleasant , to daydream about Bernard 's drives , fears , shames and possible loves . Bernard , like the real Derwatt , was a bit of a saint . A pair of flies , insane as usual , were annoying Tom . He pulled one out of his hair . They were zooming around his  | nighttable . Late for flies , and he 'd had quite enough of them this summer . The French countryside was famous for its variety of flies , which outnumbered the variety of cheeses , Tom had read somewhere . One fly jumped on the other 's back . In plain view ! Quickly Tom struck a match and held it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck in the air and flailed their last . Ah , Liebestod , united even in death ! If it could happen at Pompeii , why not at Belle Ombre , Tom thought .  | Tom spent Sunday morning lazily , writing a letter to Heloise c.o . American Express , Athens , and at 2:30 P.M. he listened to Roy Hudd on the living room radio , as he often did . Mme. Annette , on Sunday afternoons , sometimes found Tom convulsed on the yellow sofa , and Heloise now and then asked him to translate , but much of it did n't translate , not the puns . At 4 , responding to an invitation that had come that noon by telephone , Tom went to take tea with Antoine and Agnes Grais , who lived on the other side of Villeperce , walking distance . Antoine was an architect who worked in Paris and spent weekdays there in his atelier . Agnes , a quiet blonde of about twenty-eight , stayed in Villeperce and took care of their two small children . There were four other guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you been doing , Tome ? " Agnes asked , bringing out her husband 's specialty at the end of the tea , a bottle of strong old Holland gin , which the Grais recommended to be drunk neat . " Painting a little . Wandering around the garden cleaning the wrong things , probably . " The French said cleaning for weeding . " Not lonely ? When is Heloise coming back ? "  | " Maybe in a month . " The hour and a half at the Grais ' was soothing to Tom . The Grais made no comment on his two guests , Murchison and Count Bertolozzi and perhaps had not noticed them or heard of them via Mme. Annette who chatted freely in the food shops . Nor did the Grais notice his pink and almost bleeding palms , sore from the ropes around Murchison . That evening , Tom lay with his shoes off on the yellow sofa , browsing in Harrap 's Dictionary , which was so heavy he had to hold it against his thighs or rest it upon a table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would ring , and at a quarter past to , one came . Chris Greenleaf in Paris . " Is this  --  Tom Ripley ? " " Yes . Hello , Chris . How are you ? " " Fine , thanks . I just got here with my friend . I 'm awfully glad you 're in . I did n't have time to get a letter from you , in case you wrote . Well  --  look ? " " Where 're you staying ? " " At the Hotel Louisiane . Highly recommended by the fellows back home ! ? It 's my first night in Paris . I have n't even opened my suitcase . But I thought I 'd call you . " " What 're your plans ? When would you like to visit ? " " Oh , any time . Of course I want to do some tourism . The Louvre first , maybe . " " How about Tuesday ? " " Well  --  all right , but I was thinking of tomorrow , because my friend is busy all day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older man , an American . So I was hoping . . . " Somehow Tom could n't turn him down , or think of a good excuse . " Tomorrow . All right . In the afternoon ? I 'm a little busy in the morning . " Tom explained that he would have to take a train at Gare de Lyon for Moret-les-Sablons , and that he should ring again when he had chosen his train , so that Tom would know when to meet him . Obviously Chris would stay overnight tomorrow . Tom realized that he would have to finish Murchison 's grave and get him into it tomorrow morning . That was , in fact , probably  | why he had allowed Chris to come tomorrow . It was an added prod for himself . Chris sounded naive , but perhaps he had some of the Greenleaf good manners and would not outstay a welcome . Tom winced as this crossed his mind , because he had certainly outstayed his welcome at Dickie 's in Mongibello in his callow youth , when he 'd been twenty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rather had been sent by Dickie 's father , Herbert Greenleaf , to bring Dickie back home . It had been a classic situation . Dickie had n't wanted to go back to the United States . And Tom 's naivete , at that time , was something that now made him cringe . The things he had had to learn ! And then  --  well , Tom Ripley had stayed in Europe . He had learned a bit . After all he had some money  --  Dickie 's  --  the girls had liked him well enough , and in fact Tom had felt a bit pursued . Heloise Plisson had been one of the ones who had liked him . And from Tom 's point of view , she was n't a piece of cement , orthodox , or far out , or another bore . Tom had not proposed marriage , nor had Heloise . It was a dark chapter in his life , a brief one . Heloise had said , in their rented bungalow in Cannes , " Since we 're living together , why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure Papa will countenance ( how had she said countenance in French ? look that up ) our living together much longer , whereas if we were really married  --  fa serait un fait accompli . " Tom had turned green at the wedding , even though it had been a civil wedding with no audience in a courtroom of some kind . Heloise had said later , laughing , " You were green . " True . But Tom had at least gone through with it . He had hoped for a word of praise from Heloise , though he knew this was absurd on his part . It was for the bridegroom to say , " Darling , you were gorgeous ! " or " Your cheeks were glowing with beauty and happiness ! " or some such rot . Well , Tom 's had been pale green . At least he had n't collapsed going up the aisle  --  which had been a dingy passage between a few straight empty chairs in a magistrate 's office in the South of France . Marriages ought to be secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  which was n't saying much . Since everybody 's mind was frankly on the wedding night anyway at weddings , why was the affair itself so blatantly public ? There  | was something rather vulgar about it . Why could n't people surprise their friends by saying , " Oh , but we 've been married for three months now ! " It was easy to see the reason for public weddings in the past  --  she 's off our hands and you ca n't wriggle out of this one , old cock , or fifty relatives of the bride will boil you in oil  --  but why these days ? Tom went to bed . On Monday morning , again around S A.M. , Tom donned his levis and went quietly down the stairs . This time , he ran into Mme. Annette , who opened the door from the kitchen into the hall , just as Tom was about to open the front door to go out . Mme. Annette had a white cloth pressed to her cheek  --  no doubt the cloth contained hot salt of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her face . " Mme. Annette  --  it 's the tooth , " Tom said sympathetically . " I could not sleep all night , " said Mme. Annette . " You are up early , M. Tome . " " Damn that dentist , " Tom said in English . He continued in French , " The idea of a nerve falling out ! He does n't know what he 's doing . Now listen , Mme. Annette , I have some yellow pills upstairs , I just remembered them . From Paris . Especially for toothache . Wait a second . " Tom ran back up the stairs . She took one of the capsules . Mme. Annette blinked as she swallowed . She had pale blue eyes . Her thin upper lids , drawn downward at the outer corners , looked Nordic . She was a Breton on her father 's side . " If you like , I can drive you to Fontainebleau today , " Tom said . Tom and Heloise had a dentist in Fontainebleau appropriately called Dr. Tuenerf , or " kill nerve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mme. Annette 's curiosity was greater than her pain , it seemed . " I 'm going to work a little in the garden and go back to sleep for an hour or so . I also had a difficult time sleeping . " Tom persuaded her gently back to her room , and left the bottle of capsules with her . Four in twenty-four hours were all right to take , he told her . " Do n't bother with breakfast or lunch for me , dear Madame . Repose yourself today . " Then Tom went out to his task . He took it at a reasonable  | rate , or what he thought was reasonable . The trench ought to be five feet deep , and no nonsense about it . He had taken a rather rusty but still effective bucksaw from the tool shed , and with this he attacked the crisscrossing roots , heedless of the damp soil that stuck in the saw 's teeth . He made progress . It was fairly light , though the sun was by no means up , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole front of his sweater , unfortunately a beige cashmere . He looked around , but saw no one on the little lane that ran through the woods . A good thing , he thought , that the French tied up their dogs in the country , because a dog during last night might have snuffed up the branches that covered Murchison 's corpse and barked an announcement that would have carried a kilometer . Again Tom tugged on the ropes that bound Murchison 's tarpaulin . The body fell in with a thud positively delicious to Tom 's ears . The shoveling in of earth was also a pleasure . There was soil to spare , and after stamping down the grave , Tom scattered the rest of the soil about in all directions . Then he walked slowly , but with a sense of achievement , back across his lawn and around to the front door . He washed his sweater in some kind of delicate suds from Heloise 's bathroom . Then he slept excellently till after lo A.M. Tom made some coffee in the kitchen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times at the newspaper shop . Usually he stopped for a coffee somewhere while he glanced at the two newspapers  --  always a treasure to him  --  but today he wanted to be alone when he looked at the Derwatt write-ups . Tom almost forgot to buy Mme. Annette 's daily , the local edition of Le Parisien , whose headline was always in red . Today , something about a strangled twelve-year-old . The placards outside the shop touting various newspapers were equally bizarre but in a different way : JEANNE AND PIERRE KISS AGAIN ! Who were they ? MARIE FURIOUS WITH CLAUDE ! The French were never merely annoyed , they were furieux . ONASSIS FEARS THEY WILL STEAL JACKY FROM HIM !  | Were the French lying awake worrying about that ? A BABY FOR NICOLE ! Nicole who , for Christ 's sake ? Tom never knew who most of these people were  --  film stars , pop singers , perhaps  --  but they evidently sold newspapers . The activities of the English Royal Family were unbelievable , Elizabeth and Philip on the brink of divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each other 's faces . Tom put Mme. Annette 's paper on the kitchen table , then went up to his room . Both the Observer and the Sunday Times had a picture of him as Philip Derwatt on their arts review pages . In one , his mouth was open in the act of replying to questions , open in the disgusting beard . Tom looked quickly at the write-ups , not really wanting to read every word . The Observer said : " . . . breaking his long retreat with a surprise appearance Wednesday afternoon at the Buckmaster Gallery , Philip Derwatt , who prefers to be called simply Derwatt , was reticent about his Mexican whereabouts but voluble enough when questioned about his work and that of his contemporaries . On Picasso : " Picasso has periods . I have no periods . " In the Sunday Times photograph , he stood behind Jeff 's desk gesticulating with his left fist raised , an action Tom did not remember having made , but here it was . " . . . wearing clothes that had obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own against a battery of twelve reporters , which must have been a trial after six years of exclusion , we assume . " Was that " we assume " a dig ? Tom thought not , really , because the rest of the comment was favorable , or favourable as the English would spell it . " Derwatt 's current canvases maintain his high standards  --  idiosyncratic , bizarre , even sick , perhaps ? . . . None of Derwatt 's paintings is dashed off or unresolved . They are labours of love , though his technique appears quick , fresh and easy for him . This is not to be confused with facility or the look of it . Derwatt says he has never painted a picture in less than two weeks . . . " Had he said that ? " . . . and he works daily , often for more than seven hours per day . . . Men , little girls , chairs , tables , strange things on fire , these still predomi-  | nate . . . The show is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Derwatt 's disappearance after the interview . A pity , Tom thought , that some of these compliments could n't be engraved upon Bernard Tufts ' own tomb , wherever that might be finally . Tom was reminded of " Here lies one whose name was writ in water , " a line that had made Tom 's eyes fill with tears on the three occasions he had seen it in the English Protestant Cemetery in Rome , and could sometimes make his eyes water when he merely thought of it . Perhaps Bernard , the plodder , the artist , would compose his own lines before he died . Or would he be anonymously famous because of one " Derwatt , " one splendid picture which he had yet to paint ? Or would Bernard ever paint another Derwatt ? Good God , he did n't even know , Tom realized . And was Bernard painting any more of his own paintings , that might be called Tufts ? Mme. Annette was feeling better before noon . And as Tom had foreseen , because of the anodynal pills , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Fontainebleau . " Madame  --  I am inundated with invites just now , it seems . A pity Mme. Heloise is not here . But tonight there is another for dinner , a young man called M. Christophe , an American . I can do all the shopping necessary in the village . . . Non-non , you repose yourself . " And Tom did the shopping after the lunch hour , and was back home before 4 . Mme. Annette said an American had rung , but they could not understand each other , and the American would ring back . Chris did , and Tom was to pick him up at 6:30 at Moret . Tom put on old flannels , a turtleneck sweater , and desert boots , and left in the Alfa-Romeo . The menu tonight was viande hdchee  --  the French hamburger which was so red and delicious one could eat it raw . Tom had seen Americans swoon over hamburgers with onion and ketchup in the Paris Drugstores , when they had been away from America only twentyfour hours . Tom recognized Chris Greenleaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might . Though Tom 's view was obscured by several people , Christopher 's blond head stuck a bit above  | them . His eyes and his brows had the same slight frown that Dickie 's had had . Tom raised an arm in greeting , but Christopher was hesitant until their eyes actually met , and Tom smiled . The boy 's smile was like Dickie 's , but if there was a difference , it was in the lips , Tom thought . Christopher 's lips were fuller , with a fullness unrelated to Dickie and no doubt from Christopher 's mother 's side . They gripped hands . " It 's really like the country out here . " " How do you like Paris ? " " Oh , I like it . It 's bigger than I thought . " Christopher took in everything , craning his neck at the most ordinary bar-cafes , plane trees , private houses along the way . His friend Gerald might go for two or three days to Strassburg , Christopher told Tom . " This is the first French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? " he asked , as if it might be a stage-set . Tom found it amusing , strangely nervous-making , Chris 's enthusiasm . Tom remembered his own mad joy  --  though there 'd been no one for him to speak to  --  at his first glimpse of the Leaning Tower of Pisa from a moving train , his first view of the curving lights of Cannes ' shore . Belle Ombre was not fully visible in the dark now , but Mme. Annette had put the light on at the front door , and its proportions could be guessed from a light in the front left corner , where the kitchen was . Tom smiled to himself at Chris 's ecstatic comments , but they pleased Tom nevertheless . Sometimes Torn felt like kicking Belle Ombre and the Plisson family , too , to pieces , as if they were a conglomerate sand castle that he could destroy with a foot . These times came when he was maddened by some incident of French bloodymindedness , greed , a lie that was not exactly a lie but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belle Ombre , Tom liked it , too . Tom drove into the garage , and carried one of Chris 's two suitcases . Chris said he had everything with him . Mme. Annette opened the front door . " My housekeeper , faithful retainer , without whom I could n't live , " Tom said , " Mme. Annette . M. Christophe . " " How do you do ? Bon soir , " Chris said . " Bon soir , nn'sieur . The room of m'sieur is ready . "  | Tom took Chris upstairs . " This is marvelous , " Chris said . " It 's like a museum ! " There was , Tom supposed , a considerable amount of satin and ormolu . " It 's my wife , I think  --  the decorating . She 's not here just now . " " I saw a picture of her with you . Uncle Herbert showed it to me in New York just the other day . She 's blonde . Her name 's Heloise . " Tom left Christopher to wash up , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Murchison again : there would be probably something in the suitcase that could identify Murchison , Tom thought . Murchison would be missing from his ' plane 's passenger list . The police would check Paris hotels and find that Murchison had not been at any . An immigration check would show that Murchison had been at the Hotel Mandeville October 15th and 16th , and had said he would be back the 18th . Tom 's own name and address was on the Hotel Mandeville register for the night of October 16th . But he would not be the only resident of France in the Mandeville that night , surely . Would the police come to question him or would they not ? Christopher came downstairs . He had combed his wavy brown hair , and still wore his corduroy trousers and army boots . " Hope you 're not having guests for dinner . If you are , I 'll change . " " We 're alone . It 's the country , so wear what you like . " Christopher looked at Tom 's paintings , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing , than to the paintings . " You live here all year round ? It must be a pleasure . " He accepted a scotch . Tom had to account for his time again , and mentioned his gardening and his informal study of languages , though in fact Tom 's routine of study was stricter than he admitted . Tom loved his leisure , however , as only an American could , he thought  --  once an American got the hang of it , and so few did . It was not a thing he cared to put into words to anyone . He had longed for leisure and a bit of luxury when he had met Dickie Greenleaf , and now that he had attained it , the charm had not palled.  | At the table , Christopher began to talk of Dickie . He said he had photographs of Dickie that someone had taken in Mongihello , and that Tom was in one of the photographs . Christopher spoke with a little difficulty of Dickie 's death  --  his suicide , as everyone thought . Chris had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitivity . Tom was fascinated by the candlelight through the irises of his blue eyes , because so often Dickie 's eyes had looked the same late at night in Mongibello , or in some candlelit restaurant in Naples . Christopher said , standing tall and looking at the french windows , and up at the cream-colored coffered ceiling , " It 's fabulous to live in a house like this . And you have music besides  --  and paintings ! " Tom was reminded painfully of himself at twenty . Chris 's family was n't poor , Tom was sure , but their house would n't be be quite like this one . While they drank coffee , Tom played A Midsummer Night 's Dream music . Then the telephone rang . It was about ro P.M. The French telephone operator asked him if his number was so-and-so , then told him not to quit for a call from London . " Hello . This is Bernard Tufts , " said the tense voice , and there followed crackles . " Hello ? Yes . Tom here. ? Can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm ringing to say . . . " Bernard 's voice faded out as if drowned in a deep sea . Tom glanced at Chris , who was reading the sleeve of a record . " Is this better ? " Tom roared into the telephone , and as if to spite him , the telephone gave a fart , then a crack like a mountain splitting beneath a stroke of lightning . Tom 's left ear rang from the impact , and he switched to the right ear . He could hear Bernard struggling on slowly , loudly , but alas the words were quite unintelligible . Torn heard only " Murchison . " " He 's in London ! " Tom shouted , glad to have something definite to convey . Now it was something about the Mandeville . Had the Tate Gallery man tried to reach Murchison at the Mandeville , then spoken to the Buckmaster Gallery , Tom wondered ? " Bernard , it is hopeless ! " Tom yelled desperately . " Can you write me ? " Tom did n't know whether Bernard hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tom assumed Bernard had given up ,  | so he put the telephone down . " To think one pays a hundred and twenty bucks just to get a telephone in this country , " Tom said . " I 'm sorry for all the shouting . " " Oh , I 've always heard French telephones are lousy , " Chris said . " Was it important ? Heloise ? " " No , no . " Chris stood up . " I 'd like to show you my guide books . Can I ? " He ran upstairs . A matter of time , Tom thought , till the French police or the English  --  maybe even the American  --  questioned him about Murchison . Tom hoped Chris would not be here when it happened . Chris came down with three books . He had the Guide Bleu for France , an art book on French chateaux , and a big book on the Rheinland , where he intended to go with Gerald Hayman when Gerald came back from Strassburg . Christopher sipped with pleasure at a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the value of democracy . That 's a terrible thing for an American to say , is n't it ? Democracy depends on a certain minimal level of education for everybody , and America tries to give it to everybody  --  but we really have n't got it . And it is n't even true that everybody wants it .. Tom half listened . But his occasional comments seemed to satisfy Chris , at least this evening . The telephone rang again . Tom noticed that it was five to I z by the little silver clock on the telephone table . A man 's voice said in French that he was an agent of police , and apologized for ringing at this hour , but was M. Ripley there ? " Good evening , in'sieur . Do you by any chance know an American named Thomas Murchison ? " " Yes , " Tom said . " Did he by chance visit you recently ? Thursday ? Or Friday ? " " Yes , he did . " " Ah , bon ! Is he with you now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday . " " No , he did not . But his suitcase was found at Orly . He did not take the sixteen hours ' plane he was supposed to . " " Oh ? "  | " You are a friend of M. Murchison , M. Reeply ? " " No , not a friend . I have known him for only a short time . " " How did he depart from your house to Orly ? " " I drove him to Orly  --  around three thirty Friday afternoon . " " Do you know any friends of his in Paris  --  where he might be staying ? Because he is not in any hotel in Paris . " Tom paused , thinking . " No . He did not mention anyone . " This was evidently disappointing to the agent . " You are at home in the next days , M. Reeply ? . . . We may wish to speak with you ... " This time Christopher was curious . " What 's that all about ? " Tom smiled . " Oh  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . " Who was making the fuss about Murchison , Tom wondered ? The man at the Tate Gallery ? The French police at Orly , had they started it ? Or even Murchison 's wife in America ? " What 's Heloise like ? " Christopher asked .  | When Tom came downstairs the next morning , Mme. Annette told him that M. Christophe had gone out for a walk . Tom hoped not into the woods behind the house , but it was more likely Chris would look around the village . Tom picked up the London Sundays , which he had barely glanced at yesterday , and looked through the news sections for any item , however small , about Murchison , or a disappearance at Orly . There was nothing . Chris came in , pink-cheeked and smiling . He had bought a wire whisk , the kind the French beat eggs with , at the local droguerie . " Little present for my sister , " Chris said . " It does n't weigh much in a suitcase . I 'll tell her it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to take a drive and have lunch in another town . " Bring your Guide Bleu along . We 'll drive along the Seine . " Tom wanted to wait a few minutes for the post . The post brought only one letter addressed in a tall angular hand in black ink . Tom felt at once it was from Bernard , though he did n't know Bernard 's writing . He opened the letter and saw from the signature at the bottom that he was correct .  | 127 Copperfield St. SEA Dear Tom , Forgive this unexpected letter . I would like very much to see you . Can I come over ? You do not need to put me up . It would be good for me to speak with you for a bit , providing you are willing . Yours , Bernard T. P.S. I may try to ring you before you receive this . He would have to cable Bernard at once . Cable him what ? A refusal would depress Bernard further , Tom supposed , although Tom certainly did not want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable Bernard from a small town post office this morning , and give a false last name and address for himself , since the sender 's name and address were demanded at the bottom of French telegram forms . He must send Chris on his way as soon as possible , which he disliked doing . " Shall we shove off ? " Chris got up from the sofa , where he had been writing a postcard . " Fine . " Tom opened the front door in the faces of two French police officers who had been about to knock . In fact , Tom stepped back from the upraised fist in the white glove . " Bon jour . M. Reeply ? " " Yes. ? Come in , please . " They must be from Melun , Tom thought , because the two police in Villeperce knew him , and Tom knew their faces , too , but not these faces . The agents came in but declined to sit down . They removed their caps , stuck them under their arms , and the younger officer pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephoned you last evening in regard to a M. Murchison , " said the older officer , who was a connnrissaire . " We have spoken with London and after some telephone calls we ascertained that you and M. Murchison arrived at Orly on the same plane Thursday and were also at the same hotel in London , the Mandeveel.  | So ? " The coi niissaire smiled with satisfaction . " You say you brought M. Murchison to Orly at three thirty on Friday after-noon ? " " Yes . " " And you accompanied M. Murchison into the terminal ? " " No , because I could n't park my car at the pavement , you see , so I let him out . " " Did you see him go through the doors of the terminal ? " Tom thought . " I did not look back as I drove away . " " Because he left his suitcase on the pavement and he has simply disappeared. ? Was he expecting to meet someone at Orly ? " " He did not say anything about that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this , but Tom was sure he could not understand much . " He mentioned friends in London he was going to see ? " " No . Not that I recall . " " This morning we telephoned again to the Mandeveel , where he was supposed to go , to ask if they had news . They informed us no , but a M. ? " He turned to his colleague . " M. Riemer , " the younger officer supplied . " M. Riemer had telephoned to the hotel , because he had an appointment with M. Murchison on Saturday . We also learned from the London police that M. Murchison is interested in verifying a painting in his possession . One by Derwatt . Do you know anything about this ? " " Oh , yes , " Tom said . " M. Murchison had his painting with him . He wanted to see my Derwatts here . " Tom indicated them on his walls . " That is why he came over from London with me . " " Ah , I understand . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday last . I saw him at the art gallery , where the Derwatt exhibition is on , and then I saw him in my hotel that evening , and we began talking . " Tom turned and said , " Excuse me , Chris , but this is important . " " Oh , go ahead , I do n't mind , " Chris said . " Where is the painting of M. Murchison ? " " He took it with him , " Tom said .  | " It was in his suitcase ? It is not in his suitcase . " The conrmissaire looked at his colleague , and both men 's faces showed some surprise . It had been stolen at Orly , and thank God , Tom thought . " It was wrapped in brown paper . M. Murchison was carrying it . I hope it was n't stolen . " " Ah , well  --  apparently it is . What was the picture called ? And how big was it ? Can you describe it ? " Tom replied to all this accurately . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter for the London police , but we must tell them all we can . This is the picture  --  L'Horloge  --  of whose authenticity Murchison doubts ? " " Yes , he did doubt it at first . He is more of an expert than I am , " Tom said . " I was interested in what he said , because of my own two Derwatts , so I invited him to come to see them . " " And ? " The co nissaire frowned in a puzzled way . " ? what did he say about yours ? " It might have been a question inspired by simple curiosity . " Certainly he thinks mine are genuine and so do I , " Tom replied . " I think he began to think his own was genuine , too . He said he might cancel his appointment with M. Riemer . " " Ah-hah . " The conrnaissaire looked at the telephone , perhaps debating ringing Melun , but he did not ask to use the telephone . " May I offer you a glass of wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his question . They declined the wine , but they did wish to look at his paintings . Tom was pleased to show them . The two agents walked about , murmuring comments which might have been quite knowledgeable , judging from their fascinated faces and their gestures as they looked at canvases and drawings . They might have been visiting a gallery in their spare time . " A famous painter in England , Derwatt , " said the younger officer . " Yes , " Tom said . The interview was over . They thanked Tom and took their leave . Tom was glad Mme. Annette had been out on her morning shopping round .  | Christopher laughed a little when Tom had closed the door . " Well , what was that all about ? All I could understand was Orly ' and Murchison ' . " " It seems that Thomas Murchison , an American who visited me last week , did n't take his plane back to London from Orly . He seems to have disappeared . And they found his suitcase on the pavement at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disappeared ? Gosh ! ? That 's four days ago . " " I did n't know anything about it till last night . That was the telephone call I had last night . From the police . " " Gosh . How strange . " Chris asked a few questions , and Tom answered them , as he had answered the police . " Sounds like he had a black-out , leaving his luggage like that . Was he sober ? " Tom laughed . " Absolutely . I ca n't understand it . " They rambled along the Seine in the Alfa-Romeo , and near Samois , Tom showed Chris the bridge where General Patton had crossed the Seine with his army , on the way to Paris in 1944 . Chris got out and read the inscription on the gray little column , and came back as wet-eyed as Tom after the grave of Keats . Lunch in Fontainebleau , because Tom disliked the main restaurant in Bas Samois  --  Chez Bertrand or some such ? where he and Heloise had never yet received an honest addition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of starting to mop the floors before people were finished eating , dragging metal-legged chairs across tiles with merciless unconcern for the human ear . Later , Tom did not forget his little chores for Mme. Annette  --  champignons a la grecque , Merl remoulade , and some sausages whose name Tom could not remember , because he did not care for them  --  things one could not buy in Villeperce . He got them in Fontainebleau , and also some batteries for his transistor . On the way home , Chris burst out laughing and said , " This morning in the woods I came across what looked like a fresh grave . Really fresh . I thought it was funny because of the police this morning . They 're looking for a missing man who was at your house , and if they saw that grave shape in the woods ? " He went off in guffaws . Yes , it was funny , damned funny . Tom laughed at the crazy danger of it . But he made no comment .  | The next day was overcast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annette went out to fasten a shutter that was banging somewhere . She had listened to her radio , and there were dire pronouncements of an orage , she warned Tom . Wind made Tom jumpy . Tourism , that morning , was out for him and Chris . By mid-day , the storm was worse , and the wind bent the tops of the tall poplars like whips or sword-tips . Now and then a branch  --  small and dead , probably  --  was blown from a tree near the house and rattled as it hit the roof and rolled down . " I really never saw anything like it  --  here , " Tom said at lunch . But Chris , with the coolness of Dickie , or maybe of his whole family , smiled and enjoyed the disturbance . The lights went out for half an hour , which Tom said happened all the time in the French countryside , even if the storm was a mild one . After lunch , Tom went up to the room where he painted . Sometimes painting helped when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the canvas propped against a heavy vise and a few thick art books and books on horticulture . The bottom of the canvas rested on some newspapers  | plus a large paint rag which had been part of an old bed sheet . Tom bent zealously over his work , stepping back frequently to look at it . This was a portrait of Mme. Annette done inperhaps  --  rather a de Kooning style , which meant Mme. Annette would never possibly recognize it as an attempted likeness . Tom was not consciously imitating de Kooning , and had not consciously thought of him when he began this opus , but there was no doubt the picture looked like a portrait in de Kooning 's style . Mme. Annette 's pale lips were parted in a smile of slashing pink , her teeth decidedly off-white and irregular . She was in a pale purple dress with a white ruffle round the neck . All this was done with rather wide brushes and in long strokes . Tom 's preliminary work for this had been several hasty cartoons of Mme. Annette done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Mme. Annette was unaware . Now there was lightning . Tom straightened up and breathed , his chest aching from tension . On his transistor , France Culture was interviewing another uncomfortable-sounding author : " Your book , M. Hublot ( Heublein ? ) seems to me ( craclde ) ... which is a departure from  --  as several critics have said ? your up-to-now challenge to the concepts of anti-Sartrisme . But rather now it seems to be reversing . . . " Tom cut it off abruptly . There was an ominous crack close by in the woods direction , and Tom looked out his window . The tops of pines and poplars still flexed , but if any tree had fallen in the woods , he could not see it from here in the gray-green murk of the forest . A tree might just fall , even a smallish tree , and cover the damned grave , Tom thought . He hoped so . Tom was mixing a reddish brown for Mme. Annette 's hair  --  he wanted to finish the painting today  --  when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Men 's voices . Tom went into the hall . The voices were speaking English , but he could not hear what they were saying . Chris and someone else . Bernard , Tom thought . An English accent . Yes , my God ! Tom laid his palette knife carefully across the turpentine cup . He closed the door behind him and trotted downstairs . It was Bernard , standing bedraggled and wet on the mat  | just inside the front door . Tom was struck by his dark eyes which seemed deeper sunken under the straight black brows . Bernard looked terrified , Tom thought . Then in the next instant , Tom thought Bernard looked like death itself . " Bernard ! " Tom said . " Welcome ! " " Hello , " Bernard said . He had a duffelbag at his feet . " This is Christopher Greenleaf , " Tom said . " Bernard Tufts . Maybe you 've introduced yourselves . " " Yes , we have , " said Chris , smiling , pleased to have company , it seemed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  like this , " Bernard said . Tom assured him it was . Now Mme. Annette came in , and Tom introduced them . Mme. Annette asked to take Bernard 's coat . Tom said to her in French , " You might prepare the little room for M. Bernard . " This was a second guestroom , seldom used , with a single bed , which he and Heloise called " the little bedroom . " " And M. Bernard will dine with us tonight . " Then Tom said to Bernard , " What did you do ? Take a taxi from Melun ? Or Moret ? " " Yes . Melun . I looked up the town on a map in London . " Thin and angular , like his writing , Bernard stood chafing his hands . Even his jacket looked wet . " Want a sweater , Bernard ? How about a brandy to warm you up ? " " Oh , no , no , thank you . " " Come in the living room ! Some tea ? I 'll ask Madame to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernard . " Bernard looked anxiously at Chris , as if expecting him to sit down first or something . But in the next minutes , Tom realized that Bernard looked anxiously at everything , even at an ashtray on the coffee table . The exchange of words , such as it was , was extremely sticky , and Bernard plainly wished that Christopher were not here . But Chris did not seem to grasp this , Tom could see , and on the contrary thought his presence might be useful , because Bernard , obviously , was in a state . Bernard stuttered , and his hands shook . " I really wo n't disturb you for long , " Bernard said .  | Tom laughed . " But you 're not going back today ! We 're being treated to the worst weather I 've seen in the three years I 've been here. ? Did the plane have a hard time landing ? " Bernard did n't remember . His eyes drifted to the  --  his own ? Man in Chair over the fireplace , and away again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violet . In that picture . Now it was like a chemical poison to Tom . To Bernard , too , Tom supposed . " You have n't seen The Red Chairs in a long time , " Tom said , getting up . The picture was behind Bernard . Bernard got to his feet and twisted around , legs still pressed against the sofa . Tom 's effort was rewarded by a faint but genuine smile on Bernard 's face . " Yes . It 's beautiful , " Bernard said in his quiet voice . " Are you a painter ? " asked Chris . " Yes . " Bernard sat down again . " But not as good as  --  as Derwatt . " " Mme. Annette , could you put on some water for tea ? " Tom asked . Mme. Annette had come down from upstairs , carrying towels or something . " At once , M. Tome . " " Can you tell me , " Christopher began to Bernard , " what makes a painter good  --  or not ? For instance , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ca n't remember their names off hand , because they 're not as famous . Oh , yes , Parker Nunally , for one . Do you know his work ? ? What is it that makes Derwatt so good ? " Tom also tried for a correct answer , perhaps " originality . " But the word " publicity " flashed into his mind , too . He was waiting for Bernard to speak . " It is personality , " Bernard said carefully . " It is Derwatt . " " You know him ? " Chris asked . A slight pang went through Tom , a twinge of sympathy for Bernard . Bernard nodded . " Oh , yes . " Now his bony hands were clasped around one knee . " Do you feel this personality when you meet him ? See him , I mean ? "  | " Yes , " Bernard said more firmly . But he writhed , perhaps in agony , at the conversation . At the same time his dark eyes seemed to be searching for something else he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a fair question , " Chris said . " Most good artists do n't show their personalities or waste their fire in their personal life , I think . They seem perfectly ordinary on the surface . " Tea was served . " You have no suitcase , Bernard ? " Tom asked . Tom knew he had no suitcase , and was worried about Bernard 's general comfort . " No , I just came over on a hop , " Bernard said . " Do n't worry . I 've got everything you might want . " Tom felt Chris 's eyes on him and Bernard , speculating probably as to how and how well they knew each other . " Hungry ? " Tom asked Bernard . " My housekeeper loves to make sandwiches . " There were only petits fours with the tea . " Her name 's Mme. Annette . Ask her for anything you want . " " No , thank you . " Bernard 's cup made three distinct clicks against the saucer as he set it down . Tom wondered if Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need of something now ? Bernard was finished his tea , and Tom took him upstairs to show him his room . " You 'll have to share the bath with Chris , " Tom said . " You go across the hall here and through my wife 's room . " Tom left the doors open . " Heloise is n't here , she 's in Greece . I hope you can rest a bit here , Bernard. ? What 's the matter , really ? What 's worrying you ? " They were back in Bernard 's " little bedroom , " and the door was shut . Bernard shook his head . " I feel as if I 'm at the end . That 's all . The show was the end . It 's the last show I can paint . The last picture . The Tub . And now they 're trying to bring  --  you know  --  bring him back to life . " And 1 succeeded , Tom might have said , but his face remained as serious as Bernard 's . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . I 'm sure they 're not going to force you to go on painting if you do n't want to , Bernard . "  | " Oh , they 're going to try , Jeff and Ed . But I 've had enough , you see . Quite enough . " " I think they know that . Do n't worry about that . We can Look , Derwatt can go into seclusion again . In Mexico . Let 's I say he 's painting for the next many years , and refuses to show anything . " Tom walked up and down as he spoke . " Years can pass . When Derwatt dies  --  we 'll have him burn all his last paintings , something like that , so no one will ever have seen them ! " Tom smiled . Bernard 's somber eyes , staring at the floor , made Tom feel as if he had told a joke that his audience did n't get . Or worse , it committed a sacrilege , cracked a bad joke in a cathedral . " You need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I have some mild ones , quarter grains . " " No , thanks . " " Want to wash up ? Do n't worry about Chris and me . We 'll leave you in peace . Dinner at eight if you want to join us . Come down earlier if you want a drink . " The wind just then made a " Whoo-oo-oo " and a huge tree bent  --  they both glanced at the window and saw it , it was in Tom 's back garden  --  and it seemed to Tom as if the house bent , too , and he instinctively braced his feet . How could anyone be calm in this weather ? " Want me to close these curtains ? " Tom asked . " It does n't matter . " Bernard looked at Tom . " What did Murchison say when he saw Man in Chair ? " " He said he thought it was a forgery  --  at first . But I persuaded him it was n't . " " How could you ? Murchison told me what he thought about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three mistakes , Man in Chair , The Clock and now The Tub . I do n't know how it happened . I do n't know why . I was n't thinking . Murchison is right . " Tom was silent . Then he said , " Naturally it was a scare for all of us . Derwatt alive might have lived it down . It was the danger  --  the danger of his non-existence being exposed . But we 're over that hump , Bernard . " Bernard might not have followed this at all . He said , " Did you offer to buy The Clock or something like that ? "  | " No . I persuaded him that Derwatt must 've gone back  --  for a painting or two or maybe three  --  to a lavender he 'd used before . " " Murchison was even talking to me about the quality of the painting . Oh , Christ ! " Bernard sat down on the bed and slumped back . " What 's Murchison doing now in London ? " " I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert , not going to do anything , Bernard  --  because I persuaded him our way , " Tom said soothingly . " I can think of only one way you persuaded him , one wild way . " " What do you mean ? " Tom asked , smiling , a little frightened . " You persuaded him to let me alone . As a thing of pity , a thing to be pitied . I do n't wish to be pitied . " " There was no mention of you  --  naturally . " You 're mad , Tom felt like saying . Bernard was mad , or at least temporarily deranged . Yet what Bernard had said was exactly what Tom had tried to do in the cellar before he killed Murchison : persuade him to let Bernard alone , because Bernard would never paint any more " Derwatts . " Tom had even tried to make Murchison understand Bernard 's worship of Derwatt , his dead idol . " I do n't think Murchison could be persuaded , " Bernard said . " You 're not trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you , Tom ? Because I 've had just about enough of lies ! " " No . " But Tom felt uncomfortable because he was lying , to Bernard . It was seldom Tom felt uncomfortable , lying . Tom foresaw that he would have to tell Bernard at some time that Murchison was dead . It was the only way to reassure Bernard ? reassure him partially , on the forgery score at least . But Tom could n't tell him now , not in this nerve-racking storm , not in the state Bernard was in now , or Bernard would really go berserk . " I 'll be back in a minute , " Tom said . Bernard got up from the bed at once and walked toward the window , just as the wind threw a hard spray of rain against the panes . Tom winced at it , but Bernard did not . Tom went into his room , got some pajamas and a Madras dressing gown for Bernard , also houseslippers , and a new toothbrush still in its plastic  | box . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none , and brought the other things into Bernard 's room . He told Bernard he would be downstairs if he wanted anything , and that he would leave him to rest for a while . Chris had gone into his room , Tom saw from his light . The storm had made the house unnaturally dark . Tom went into his own room and got the Count 's toothpaste from his top drawer . By rolling the bottom up , the tube was usable , and it was better that he use it than throw it away and run the risk of Mme. Annette 's seeing it in the garbage : inexplicable and wanton waste . Tom took his own toothpaste from the basin and put it in the bathroom used by Chris and Bernard . What the hell would he do with Bernard , Tom wondered ? And what if the police came back and Bernard was present , as Chris had been present ? Bernard understood French pretty well . Tom sat down and wrote a letter to Heloise . Writing her always had a calming effect on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he usually did n't bother running to the dictionary , because his errors amused Heloise . OCt. 22 , 19- Heloise cherie , A cousin of Dickie Greenleaf , a nice boy named Christophe , is visiting for a couple of days . He is making his first visit to Paris . Imagine seeing Paris for the first time at the age of twenty ? He is very astonished by its size . He is from California . Today there is a terrible storm . Everyone is nervous . Wind and rain . I miss you . Did you get the red bathing suit ? I told Mme. Annette to airmail it and gave her lots of money , so if she did not send it airmail , I will hit her . Everyone asks when are you coming home . I had tea with the Grais . I feel myself very all alone without you . Come back and we shall sleep in each other 's arms . Your solitary husband , Tom  | Tom stamped the letter and took it downstairs to put on the hall table . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sofa . He jumped up . " Listen ? " He spoke quietly . " What 's the matter with your friend ? " " He 's had a crisis . In London . He 's depressed about his work . And I think he 's had a ? He 's broken off with his girl friend or she has with him . I do n't know . " " You know him well ? " " Not too . No . " " I was wondering  --  since he 's in such a funny state  --  if you 'd like me to take off . Tomorrow morning . Even tonight . " " Oh , certainly not tonight , Chris . In this weather ? No , it does n't bother me , your being here . " " But I had the feeling it bothered him . Bernard . " Chris jerked his head toward the stairs . " Well  --  there 's plenty of room in this house for us to talk , Bernard and I , if he wants to . Do n't worry . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . " He shoved his hands in his back pockets and walked toward the french windows . At any moment now , Mme. Annette would come in and draw the curtains , Tom thought , which would at least be something calm in all this chaos . " Look ! " Chris pointed out toward the lawn . " What is it ? " A tree had fallen , Tom supposed , a minor matter . It took him a moment to see what Chris had seen , because it was so dark . Tom made out a figure walking slowly across the lawn , and his first thought was Murchison 's ghost , and he jumped . But Tom did n't believe in ghosts . " It 's Bernard ! " Chris said . It was Bernard , of course . Tom opened the french windows and stepped out into the rain which was now a cold spray blown in all directions . " Hey , Bernard ! What 're you doing ? " Tom saw that Bernard was n't reacting , was still walking slowly , his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tripped on the top step of his stone stairs , nearly fell down the rest of them , and caught himself only at the  | bottom , turning an ankle at the same time . " Hey , Bernard , come in ! " Tom yelled , limping toward him now . Chris ran down and joined Tom . " You 'll get soaking wet ! " Chris said with a laugh , and started to grab Bernard 's arm , but evidently did n't dare . Tom took Bernard 's wrist firmly . " Bernard , are you trying to catch a sensational cold ? " Bernard turned to them and smiled , and the rain dripped down his black hair that was plastered to his forehead . " I like it . I really do . I feel like this ! " He lifted his arms high , breaking Tom 's hold . " But you 're coming in now ? Please , Bernard . " Bernard smiled at Tom . " Oh , all right , " he said , as if he were humoring Tom . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because Bernard seemed to want to absorb every drop . Bernard was in good humor , and made some cheerful comment as he removed his shoes at the french windows , so as not to soil the rug . He also removed his jacket . " You 've really got to change , " Tom said . " I 'll get something for you . " Tom was taking off his own shoes . " Very well , I 'll change , " Bernard said , in the same tone of condescension , and slowly climbed the stairs , shoes in hand . Chris looked at Tom and frowned intently , like Dickie " That guy 's nuts ! " he whispered . " Really nuts ! " Tom nodded , strangely shaken  --  shaken as he always was when in the presence of someone genuinely a bit off in the head . It was a feeling of being shattered . The sensation was setting in early : usually it took twenty-four hours . Tom stepped cautiously on his ankle and worked it around . It was not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You may be right , " he said to Chris . " I 'll go up and find some dry clothes for him . "  | Around 10 that evening , Tom knocked on Bernard 's door . " It 's me . Tom . " " Oh , come in , Tom , " Bernard 's voice said calmly . He was sifting at the writing table , pen in hand . " Please do n't be alarmed by my walking in the rain tonight . I was myself in the rain . And that 's become a rare thing . " Tom understood , only too well . " Sit down , Tom ! Shut the door . Make yourself at home . " Tom sat down on Bernard 's bed . He had come to see Bernard as he had promised during dinner , in the presence of Chris , in fact . Bernard had been more cheerful during dinner . Bernard was wearing the Madras dressing gown . There were a couple of sheets of paper covered with Bernard 's black ink handwriting on the table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter . " I suppose a lot of the time you feel you 're Derwatt , " Tom said . " Sometimes . But who could be really him ? And when I walk down a London street , no . Just sometimes when I paint , for seconds at a time , I 've felt I 'm him . And you know , I can talk easily now about it , and it 's a pleasure , because I 'm going to give it up . I have . "  | And that was perhaps a confession on the writing table , Tom thought . A confession to whom ? Bernard put his arm over the back of his chair . " And you know , my faking , my forgeries , have evolved in four or five years the way Derwatt 's painting might have evolved . It 's funny , is n't it ? Tom did n't know what to say that would be correct , even respectful enough . " Maybe it 's not funny . You understood Derwatt . And critics have said the same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't imagine how strange it is to paint like  --  Bernard Tufts . His painting has n't developed as much . It 's as if I 'm faking Tufts now , because I 'm painting the same Tufts as I did five years ago ! " Bernard gave a real laugh . " In a way , I have to make more of an effort to be myself than I do to be Derwatt . I did . And it was making me mad , you see . You can see that . I 'd like to give myself a chance , if there 's anything of me left . " He meant give Bernard Tufts a chance , Tom knew . " I 'm positive that can be done . You should be the one that calls the tune . " Tom took his Gauloises from a pocket and offered Bernard one . " I want to start with a clean slate . I intend to admit what I 've done and start from there  --  or try to . " " Oh , Bernard ! You 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only one involved . Think what it 'd do to Jeff and Ed . All the pictures you 've painted would ? Really , Bernard , confess it to a priest , if you want to , but not the press . Or the English police . " " You think I 'm mad , I know . Well , I am sometimes . But I have only one life to lead . I 've nearly ruined it . I do n't intend to ruin the rest . And that 's my affair , is n't it ? " Bernard 's voice shook . Was he strong or weak , Tom wondered ? " I do understand , " Tom said gently . " I do n't mean to sound dramatic , but I have to see if people will accept me  --  see if they 'll forgive me , if you like . " They wo n't , Tom thought . The world absolutely would n't . Would it smash Bernard if he said this ? Probably . Bernard might commit suicide instead of making a confession . Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , nothing came to him . " For another thing , I think Cynthia would like it if I made a clean breast of things . She loves me . I love her . I know she did n't want to see me just now . In London . Ed told me . I do n't blame her . Jeff and Ed presenting me like an invalid case : Come to see Bernard , he needs you ! ' " Bernard said in a mincing voice . " What woman would ? " Bernard looked at Tom and opened his arms , smiling . " You see how much good the rain did me , Tom ? It did everything but wash away my sins . " His laugh came again , and Tom envied him the carefreeness of it . " Cynthia 's the only woman I 've ever loved. ? I do n't mean ? ' Well , she 's had an affair or two since me , I 'm sure . I was the one who more or less ended it . I got so  --  nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitating Derwatt . " Bernard gulped . " But I know she still loves me  --  if I 'm me . Can you understand that ? " " I certainly can . Of course. ? Are you writing to Cynthia now ? " Bernard waved an arm at the sheets of paper and smiled . " No , I 'm writing  --  to anyone . It 's just a statement . It 's for the press or anyone . " And that had to be stopped . Tom said calmly , " I wish you 'd think things over for a few days , Bernard . " " Have n't I had enough time to think ? " Tom tried to think of something stronger , clearer to say to Bernard that would stop him , but half his mind was on Murchison , on the possibility of the police returning . How hard would they search here for clues ? Would they look in the woods ? Tom Ripley 's reputation was already a bit  --  stained , perhaps , by the Dickie Greenleaf story . Though he 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under suspicion , there had been a story there , despite its happy ending . Why had n't he put Murchison in the station wagon and driven him miles away to bury him , somewhere in the forest of Fontainebleau , camped out in the woods to get the job done , if he 'd had to ? " Can we talk about it tomorrow ? " Tom said . " You might see things differently , Bernard . "  | " Of course , we can talk about it any time . But I 'm not going to feel any different tomorrow . I wanted to talk to you first , because you thought of the whole idea  --  of resurrecting Derwatt . I want to start with first things first , you see . I 'm quite logical . " There was a touch of the insane in his dogmatic delivery of this , and Tom felt again a profound unease . The telephone rang . There was a telephone in Tom 's room , and the sound came clearly across the hall of the house . Tom jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I wo n't drag you into it , Tom . " " The telephone . Good night , Bernard , " Tom said quickly , and dashed across the hall to his room . He did n't want Chris to pick up the phone downstairs . It was the police again . They apologized for ringing this late , but Tom said , " I 'm sorry , m'sieur , but could you ring back in perhaps five minutes ? I am just now ? " The courteous voice said of course he could ring back . Tom hung up and sank his face in his hands . He was sitting on the edge of his bed . He got up and shut his door . Events were getting a bit ahead of him . He 'd been in a hurry about burying Murchison because of the damned Count . What a mistake ! The Seine , the Loing were snaking around everywhere in the district , there were quiet bridges , quiet especially after 1 o'clock in the morning . The telephone call from the police could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had Murchison said her name was ? ? might have engaged an American or English detective to find her husband . She knew what Murchison 's mission had been , to find out if a painting by an important artist was a forgery or not . Would n't she suspect foul play ? If Mme. Annette were questioned , would n't she say that she had n't actually seen M. Murchison leave the house Friday afternoon ? If the police wanted to see him tonight , Chris might volunteer the information about the grave-like patch in the woods . Tom envisaged Chris saying in English , " Why do n't you tell them about . . . " and Tom would n't be able to say something else to the police in French , because Chris would probably want to watch them digging .  | The telephone rang again , and Tom answered it calmly . " Hello , M. Reeply . The Prefecture of Melun here . We have had a telephone call from London . Mme. Murchison has engaged the London Metropolitan Police , which wants us to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inspector will arrive tomorrow morning . Now , if you please , did M. Murchison make any telephone calls from your house ? We should like to trace the numbers . " " I ca n't remember , " Tom said , " that he made a single telephone call . But I was not in the house all the time . " They could look at his telephone account , Tom thought , but let them think of that . A moment later , they had hung up . It was unfriendly , a little off-putting that the London police had n't rung Tom direct to ask questions , Tom thought . He felt the London police were already treating him as suspect , and preferred to get Information through official channels . Somehow Tom feared an English detective more than a French detective , although for overall minutiae and sticklership , he had to give the French high marks . He had to do two things , get the body out of the woods and Chris out of the house . And Bernard ? Tom 's brain almost boggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading , but he yawned and stood up . " I was just going to turn in . How 's Bernard ? I thought he was better at dinner . " " Yes , I think so , too . " Tom hated what he had to say , or hinting at it , which was worse . " I found a timetable by the telephone . There 's a train in the morning at nine fifty-two and one at eleven thirty-two . I can get a taxi from here to the station . " Tom was relieved . There were earlier trains , but it was impossible for him to propose them . " Whichever one you want . I 'll take you to the station. ? I do n't know what to make of Bernard , but I think he wants to be alone with me for a couple of days . " " I only hope it 's safe , " Chris said earnestly . " You know , I thought of staying on a day or so just to give you a hand  | with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly . " There was a fellow in Alaska  --  I did my service there  --  who cracked up , and he acted a lot like Bernard . Just all of a sudden he turned violent , socking everybody . " " Well , I doubt that Bernard will . Maybe you and your friend Gerald can visit after Bernard leaves . Or after you get back from the Rheinland . " Chris brightened at this prospect . When Chris had gone upstairs ( he wanted the 9:52 A.M. train tomorrow ) , Tom walked up and down the living room . It was five minutes to midnight . Something had to be done about Murchison 's corpse tonight . A hell of a task for one person to dig it up in the dark , load it in the station wagon and dump it  --  where ? Off some little bridge , maybe . Tom pondered the idea of asking Bernard to help him . Would Bernard blow up or be cooperative  --  confronted by reality ? Tom sensed that he was n't going to be able to persuade Bernard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corpse shock him into a sense of the seriousness of the situation ? It was a hell of a question . Would Bernard take the leap into faith as Kierkegaard put it ? Tom smiled as the phrase crossed his mind . But he had taken the leap when he had dashed to London to impersonate Derwatt . That leap had succeeded . He had taken another leap in killing Murchison . To hell with it . Nothing ventured , nothing gained . Tom went to the stairway , but had to slow his pace because of the pain in his ankle . In fact , he paused with his bad foot on the first step , his hand on the gilt angel that formed the newel post . It had occurred to him that if Bernard balked tonight , Bernard would have to be disposed of , too . Killed . It was a sickening thought . Tom did not want to kill Bernard . Perhaps he would not even be able to . So if Bernard refused to help him , and added Murchison to his confession Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the little light that came from Tom 's own room . Bernard 's light was off , and Chris 's seemed to be , too , but that did n't mean Chris was asleep . It was difficult  | for Tom to lift his hand and knock on Bernard 's door . He knocked gently , because Chris 's room was only eight feet away , and he did not want Chris to eavesdrop by way of protecting him from a possible assault by Bernard .  | Bernard did not answer , and Tom opened the door and went in and closed it behind him . " Bernard ? " " Hm-m ? ? Tom ? " " Yes . Excuse me . Can I put on the light ? " " Of course . " Bernard sounded quite calm , and found the bedside light himself . " What 's the matter ? " " Oh , nothing . I mean , it 's just that I 've got to talk to you and quietly , because I do n't want Chris to hear . " Tom pulled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down . " Bernard  --  I 'm in trouble , and I 'd like you to give me a hand , if you will . " Bernard frowned with attention . He reached for his pack of Capstan Full-strength and lit one . " What 's the trouble ? " " Murchison is dead , " Tom said softly . " That 's why you do n't have to worry about him . " " Dead ? " Bernard frowned . " Why did n't you tell me ? " " Because  --  I killed him . Here in the cellar . " Bernard gasped . " You did ? ? You do n't mean that , Tom ! " " Sh-h . " Oddly , Tom had the feeling Bernard was more sane than he at the moment . It made things more difficult for Tom , because he had anticipated a more bizarre reaction on Bernard 's  | part . " I had to kill him  --  here  --  and he 's buried now in the woods behind the house . My problem is , I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are already telephoning , you see . Tomorrow they may come and look around . " " Killed him ? " Bernard said , still incredulous . " But why ? " Tom sighed , shuddering . " First , need I point out , he was going to explode Derwatt ? Derwatt , Limited ? Second and worst , he recognized me down in the cellar . He recognized my hands . He said , You pretended to be Derwatt in London . ' It was suddenly all up . I had no intention of killing him when I brought him here . " " Dead , " Bernard repeated , stunned . Tom was impatient as the minutes slipped by . " Believe me , I did my best to make him let things alone . I even told him you were the forger , you the fellow he 'd talked to in the bar of the Mandeville . Yes , I saw you there , " Tom said before Bernard could speak . " I told him you were n't going to paint any more Derwatts . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So  --  will you help me get the corpse off my grounds ? " Tom glanced at the door . It was still closed , and there had been no sound from the hall . Bernard got slowly out of bed . " And what do you want me to do ? " Tom stood up . " In about twenty minutes , I 'd be grateful if you gave me a hand . I 'd like to take it away in the station wagon . It 'll be much easier if there 're two of us . I really ca n't do the whole thing alone . He 's heavy . " Tom felt better , because he was talking the same way he often thought . " If you do n't want to help me , all right , I can try it alone , but ? " " All right , I 'll help you . " Bernard spoke in a resigned way , as if he meant it , yet Tom mistrusted it . Was Bernard going to have some unpredictable reaction later , in half an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saint saying to  --  well , someone superior to a saint , " I will follow , wherever you lead . " " Could you put some clothes on ? Those trousers I gave you today . Try to be quiet . Chris must n't hear us . " " Right . " " Can you be downstairs  --  outside the front steps in fifteen  | minutes ? " Tom looked at his watch . " Twelve twenty-seven now. , , " Yes . " Tom went downstairs and unlocked the front door , which Mme. Annette had locked for the night . Then he hobbled upstairs to his room where he took off his houseslippers and put on shoes and a jacket . He went back downstairs and picked up his car keys from the hall table . He turned off the livingroom lights , except one : he often left one lamp burning all night . Then he took a raincoat and pulled on some rubber boots , which were on the floor in the spare loo , over the shoes . He took a torch from the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spare loo . This light could stand upright on the ground . He drove the Renault station wagon out , and into the lane that led to the woods . He used only his parking lights , and having reached what he thought was the right spot , he cut them . He went into the woods with his torch , found the grave , then holding the torch so its beam was concealed as much as possible , he made his way to the tool shed , and got the shovel and the fork . These he took back to the muddy splotch which was Murchison 's grave . Then he walked calmly , thinking of conserving strength , back along the lane to the house . Tom expected Bernard to be late , and was fully braced for him not to appear at all . Bernard was there , standing like a statue in the dark hall , in his own suit that had been wet a few hours ago , but which Bernard had draped over the long radiator in his room , Tom had noticed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lane , Tom saw that Chris 's window was still dark . Only Bernard 's light was on . " It 's not far. ? That 's the trouble ! " Tom said , crazily amused suddenly . He handed Bernard the fork and kept the shovel , because he thought the shovel work was harder . " I regret to say it 's pretty deep . " Bernard went at the task with his odd resignation , but his plunges with the fork were strong and effective . Bernard tossed the earth out , but soon he was merely loosening it , and Tom was  | standing in the trench shoveling out the soil as fast as he could . " I 'll take a break , " Tom said at last , but his break was carrying two big stones , each of which weighed over thirty pounds , to the back of the car . He had opened the drop-door , and Tom pushed the stones in . Bernard had reached the body . Tom got down and tried to use his shovel to prize it up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet apart on either side of the body , hauled at the ropes . Tom 's broke or came undone , and he cursed and tied it again , while Bernard held the torch . Something might have been sucking Murchison 's body into the earth : it was like some force working against them . Tom 's hands were muddy and sore , maybe bleeding . " It 's very heavy , " said Bernard . " Yes . We 'd better say one , two , three , ' and really give it a heave . " " Yes . " " One  --  two ? " They were braced . " ? three ! Oop ! " Murchison went up onto ground level . Bernard had had the heavier end , the shoulders . " The rest ought to be easier , " Tom said , just to be saying something . They got the body into the car . The tarpaulin was still dripping clods , and the front of Tom 's raincoat was a mess . " Got to put the dirt back . " Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the easiest part , and Tom for good measure pulled a couple of blown-down branches over it . Bernard casually dropped his fork to the ground , and Tom said , " Let 's put the tools back in the car . " So they did . Then Tom and Bernard got into the car , and Tom drove in reverse , regretting the whine of the motor , toward the road . There was nowhere to turn in the lane . Then to Tom 's horror , he saw Chris 's light come on , just as he was backing into the road to start forward . Tom had glanced up at the dark window  --  Chris had a side window as well  --  and the light had blinked on then , as if in greeting . Tom said nothing to Bernard . There was no streetlight here , and Tom hoped that  | Chris could not make out the color ( dark green ) of the car , though Tom 's parking lights were on now , out of necessity . " Where 're we going ? " Bernard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . A bridge ? " There was not another car on the road just now , which was not unusual at the hour of r : go A.M. Tom had driven back from enough late dinner parties to know that . " Thanks , Bernard . Everything is fine , " Tom said . Bernard was silent . They came to the place Tom had thought of . It was beside a village called Voisy , a name Tom had never paid much attention to until tonight , when he had to pass the village marker and go through the village in order to get to the bridge he had recalled . The river was the Loing , Tom thought , which flowed into the Seine . Not that Murchison was going to flow very far with those stones on him . There was a dim and economical streetlight at this end of the bridge , but none at the other end which was black . Tom drove the car to the other end , and a few yards past the bridge . In the dark , with some aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tarpaulin and retied the ropes . " Now we drop it , " Tom said softly . Bernard was moving with a calm efficiency , and seemed to know exactly what to do . The two of them carried the body , even with the stones , with fair ease . The wooden parapet of the bridge was four feet high . Tom , walking backward , looked all around , at the dark village behind him where only two streetlights showed , ahead where the bridge disappeared into blackness . " I think we can risk the middle , " Tom said . So they went to the middle of the bridge , and set the corpse down for a few moments until they gathered strength . Then they bent and lifted , and with a mutual heave they raised it high and over it went . The splash was shattering  --  giving the effect of a boom in the silence , like a cannon that might awaken the village  --  and then came a hail of splatters . They walked back toward the car . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they any energy left ?  | They got into the car and started off straight ahead , Torn neither knowing nor caring where they were going . " It 's finished ! " Tom said . " The damned thing 's off our hands ! " He felt wonderfully happy , light and free . " I did n't tell you , I think , Bernard , " Tom said in a gay tone , his throat now not even dry , " I 've told the police I dropped Murchison at Orly on Friday . I did drop his luggage there . So if Murchison did n't take his plane , it 's not my fault , is it ? Ha ! " Tom laughed , as he had often laughed alone , with similar relief after ghastly moments . " By the way , The Clock was stolen at Orly . Murchison had it with his suitcase . I 'd imagine anyone seeing Derwatt 's signature would hang onto the picture and say nothing about it ! " But was Bernard exactly with him ? Bernard said nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheering . The rain might , probably would erase his car tracks on the lane near his house , and would certainly aid the appearance of the now empty grave . " I have to get out , " Bernard said , reaching for the door handle . " What ? " " I feel sick . " As soon as he could , Tom pulled closer to the edge of the road and stopped . Bernard got out . " Want me to go with you ? " Tom asked quickly . " No , thanks . " Bernard went a couple of yards to the right , where a dark bank rose abruptly a few feet high . He bent over . Tom felt sorry for him . Himself so merry and well , and Bernard sick at his stomach . Bernard stayed two minutes , three , four , Tom thought . A car was approaching from behind , moving at an easy speed . Tom had an impulse to douse his lights , but left them as they were , normal headlights on , but not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car 's headlights swept over Bernard 's figure for a second . A police car , for God 's sake ! The roof had a blue light on it . The police car veered around Tom 's car and went on , at the same easy speed . Tom relaxed . Thank goodness ! They had no doubt thought Bernard was stopping to pee , and in France that was certainly not against the law at the edge of a  | country road , even in plain view in broad daylight . Bernard said nothing about the car when he got back in , and neither did Tom . Back at the house , Tom drove quietly into the garage . He took out the shovel and fork and leaned them against a wall , then wiped out the back of the car with a rag . He closed the drop-door till it half-latched , not wanting to make a bang by closing it . Bernard was waiting . Tom gestured , and they went out of the garage . Tom closed the doors and gently snapped the padlock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carried them . Tom noticed that Chris 's light had not been on when the car approached the house . Now Tom used his torch and they climbed the stairs . Tom motioned for Bernard to go to his room , and signaled that he would be back in a moment . Tom emptied his raincoat pockets and dropped the raincoat in the tub . He rinsed his boots under the tub tap , and stuck the boots in a closet . He could later wash his raincoat and hang it in the closet , so Mme. Annette would not see it in the morning . Then he went silently , in pajamas and houseslippers now , to see Bernard . Bernard was standing in stocking feet , smoking a cigarette . His soiled jacket was over a straight chair . " Not much more can happen to that suit , " Tom said . " Let me take care of it . " Bernard moved slowly , but he moved . He took off his trousers and handed them to Tom . Tom took the trousers and jacket into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and get it to a fast cleaners . It was not a good suit , which was typical of Bernard . Jeff or Ed had told Tom that Bernard did not accept all the money they wanted to give him from Derwatt , Ltd . Tom went back to Bernard 's room . It was the first time Tom appreciated the solidity of his parquet floors : they did n't creak . " Can I bring you a drink , Bernard ? I think you could use one . " Now he could afford to be seen downstairs , Tom thought by Mme. Annette or even Chris . He could even say he and  | Bernard had had a whim to take a little drive , and they 'd just come back . " No , thanks , " Bernard said . Tom wondered if Bernard could get to sleep , but he was afraid to propose anything else , like a sedative or even hot chocolate , because he thought Bernard would say again , " No , thanks . " Tom said , whispering , " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep all morning if you feel like it ? Chris is leaving in the morning . " " All right . " Bernard 's face was a pale olive color . He did not look at Tom . His lips had a firm line , like lips that seldom smiled or spoke  --  and now his mouth looked disappointed . He looked betrayed , Tom thought . " I 'll take care of your shoes , too . " Tom picked them up . In his bathroom  --  his room door and bathroom door closed now , against Chris , possibly ? Tom washed his own raincoat , and sponged Bernard 's suit . He rinsed Bernard 's desert boots and put them on a newspaper near the radiator in the loo . Mme. Annette , though she brought his coffee and did his bed , did not go into his bathroom except perhaps once a week to give it a tidying , and the serious cleaning woman , a Mme. Clusot , came once a week and was due today , in the afternoon . At last , Tom took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad as they felt . He put Nivea on them . In a curious way , he felt that he had dreamed the last hour or so  --  gone through the motions of it somewhere , which had made his hands sore ? and that what had happened was not real . The telephone gave an annunciatory ping . Tom leapt for it , catching it midway in its peal , which seemed shockingly loud . It was nearly 3 A.M. Beep-beep . . . burr-r-rr. . . . dup-dup-dup . . . beep ? Submarine sounds . Where was this call coming from ? " Vous etes . . . ne quittez pas . . . Athene vows appelle . . . " Heloise . " ' Elio , Tome ! . . . Tome ! " That was all Tom could understand for a maddening several seconds . " Can you talk louder ? " he said in French . Heloise was telling him , he barely gathered , that she was un-  | happy and bored , terriblenzent ennuyee . Something else , maybe someone , was absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norita . . . " Lolita ? " Come home , darling ! I miss you ! " Tom yelled in English , " To hell with those stinks ! " " I do n't know what I should do . " This came clearly . " I was trying since two hours to reach you . Even the telephone does not work here . " " It 's not supposed to work anywhere . It 's just a device to extort money . " Tom was pleased to hear her laugh a little ? like a siren laughing beneath the sea . " Do you love me ? " " Of course I love you ! " Just as audibility was improving , they were cut off . Tom was sure Heloise had not hung up . The telephone did not ring again . It was 5 A.M. in Greece , Tom supposed . Had Heloise rung from an Athens hotel ? From that crazy yacht ? He wanted very much to see her . He had grown used to her , and he missed her . Was that loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the present debris first . Heloise was rather amoral , but she would not be able to take all this . And of course she knew nothing about the Derwatt forgeries.  | Tom awakened groggily at Mme. Annette 's tap at his door . She brought his cup of black coffee . " Good morning , M. Tome ! It 's a beautiful day today ! " The sun was indeed shining , a fantastic change from yesterday . Tom sipped his coffee , letting its black magic creep through him , then he got up and dressed . Tom knocked on Chris 's door . There was still time to catch the 9:52 train . Chris was in bed with a large map spread against his knees . " I decided to take the eleven thirty-two  --  if it 's all right . I so enjoy loafing in bed like this for a few minutes . " " Sure it 's all right , " Tom said . " You should 've asked Mme. Annette to bring you some coffee . " " Oh , that 's too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I 'd take a quick walk . " " Okay . See you later , then . " Tom went downstairs . He reheated the coffee and poured another cup in the kitchen and stood looking out the window , sipping it . He saw Chris walking from the house , opening the big gates . He turned left in the direction of the town . He was probably going to pick up a cafe au lait and a croissant in a bar-cafe , french style .  | Evidently Bernard was still sleeping , which was all to the good . At ten past 9 , the telephone rang . An English voice spoke carefully : " This is Detective-Inspector Webster , London Metropolitan Police . Is Mr. Ripley there ? " Was this the theme song of his existence ? " Yes , speaking . " " I 'm ringing from Orly . I 'd like very much to see you this morning , if possible . " Tom wanted to say that this afternoon would be more convenient , but his usual boldness was not with him just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inspector might suspect he would spend the morning trying to hide something . " This morning would be quite all right . Are you coming by train ? " " I thought I 'd take a taxi , " the voice said casually . " It does n't seem all that far . How long should it take by taxi ? " " About an hour . " " I 'll see you in about an hour then . " Chris would still be here . Tom poured another cup of coffee and took it up for Bernard . He would have preferred to keep Bernard 's presence a secret from Inspector Webster , but under the circumstances , and also not knowing what Chris might blurt out , Tom thought it wisest not to try to conceal Bernard . Bernard was awake , lying on his back , with his head propped on two pillows and his fingers interlaced under his chin . He might have been in the middle of some matudinal meditation . " Morning , Bernard . Like some coffee ? " " Yes , thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police arriving in an hour . He may want to talk with you . It 's about Murchison , of course . " " Yes , " Bernard said . Tom waited until Bernard had had a sip or two of coffee . " I did n't put any sugar in it . I did n't know if you liked it . " " Does n't matter . That 's excellent coffee . " " Now Bernard , it 's obviously best if you say you never met Murchison , never saw him . You never had that talk with him in the Mandeville bar . Do you understand ? " Tom hoped it was penetrating . " Yes . "  | " And also , you never even heard of Murchison , even through Jeff and Ed . As you know , you 're not supposed to be a very close friend of Jeff or Ed now . You all know one another , but Jeff and Ed would n't have troubled to tell you there was an American who  --  suspected The Clock was n't genuine . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . " " And  --  the easiest thing to remember , because it 's true , " Tom continued , as if he were talking to a class of schoolchildren who were not listening very carefully , " is that you arrived here yesterday afternoon , a good twenty-four hours after Murchison left to go to London . Naturally , you never saw him or heard of him . All right , Bernard ? " " All right , " Bernard said . He was propped on one elbow . " Want something to eat ? Eggs ? I can bring you a croissant . Mme. Annette 's been out and bought some . " " No , thanks . " Tom went downstairs . Mme. Annette was coming in from the kitchen . " M. Tome , look . " She showed him the front page of her newspaper . " Is this not the gentleman , the M. Murcheeson who visited Thursday ? It says they are looking for M. Murcheeson ! " A la recherche de M. Murcheeson . . . Tom looked at the two-column-wide photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower left corner of Le Parisien  --  Edition Seine et Marne . " Yes , it is , " Tom said . It read : Thomas F. Murchison , 52 , American , has been declared missing since Friday afternoon , October 18th . His suitcase was found at the departure door at Orly Airport , but he did not board his airplane for London . M. Murchison is a business executive of New York , and had been visiting a friend in the region of Melun . His wife Harriet in America has begun inquiries with the aid of French and English police . Tom was thankful that they had not mentioned his name . Chris came in the front door , with a couple of magazines in his hand , but not a newspaper . " Hello , Tom ! Madame ! It 's a beautiful day ! " Tom greeted him , then said to Mme. Annette , " I had  | thought by now he would have been found . But in fact  --  an Englishman is coming this morning to ask me some questions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In half an hour or so . " " What a mystery ! " she said . " What 's a mystery ? " Chris asked Tom . " Murchison . A picture of him in today 's paper . " Chris looked at the photograph with interest , and slowly read aloud some of the phrases underneath it , translating . " Gosh ! Still missing ! " " Madame Annette , " Tom said , " I am not sure if the Englishman will stay for lunch . Could you manage four ? " " But yes , M'sieur Tome . " She went off to the kitchen . " What Englishman ? " Chris asked . " Another one ? " fig Chris 's French was improving rapidly , Tom thought . " Yes , he 's coming to ask about Murchison . You know  --  if you want the eleven thirty train ? " " Well  --  could I stay ? There 's a train just after twelve , and of course some trains this afternoon . I 'm curious about Murchison , what they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living room when you spoke with him , if you want to be alone . " Tom was irked , but he said , " Why not ? No secrets . " The Detective-Inspector arrived by taxi around 1o:30 . Tom had forgot to tell him how to find the house , but he said he had asked at the post office for the house of M. Ripley . " What a lovely place you have ! " said the Inspector cheerfully . He was about forty-five , in plain clothes . He had black , thinning hair and a slight paunch , and wore black-rimmed glasses through which he peered alertly and courteously . In fact his pleasant smile appeared to be fixed . " Been living here long ? " " Three years , " Tom said . " Wo n't you sit down ? " Tom had opened the door , since Mme. Annette had not seen the taxi come up , and Tom now took the Inspector 's coat . The Inspector carried a neat slender black case of the kind that could hold a suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if he were not in the habit of parting with it . " Well  --  first things first . When did you last see Mr. Murchison ? " Tom sat down on a straight chair . " Last Friday . About  | three-thirty in the afternoon . I took him to Orly . He was going to London . " " I know . " Webster opened his black case a little and took a notebook from it , then pulled a pen from his pocket . He wrote notes for a few seconds . " He was in good spirits ? " he asked , smiling . He reached for a cigarette from his jacket pocket , and lit it quickly . " Yes . " Tom started to say he had just made him a present of a nice Margaux , but he did n't want to refer to his cellar . " And he had his picture with him . Called The Clock , I think . " " Yes . Wrapped in brown paper . " " Apparently stolen at Orly , yes . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He said he suspected it  --  at first . " " How well do you know Mr. Murchison ? For how long ? " Tom explained . " I remembered seeing him go into the back office at the gallery , where Derwatt was , I 'd heard . So  --  when I saw Mr. Murchison in the bar of my hotel that evening , I spoke to him . I wanted to ask him what Derwatt was like . " " I see . And then ? " " We had a drink together , and Murchison told me his idea that a few of Derwatt 's paintings were being forged  --  lately . I said I had a couple of Derwatts in my house in France , and I asked if he wanted to come over and see them . So we came over together Thursday afternoon and he spent the night here . " The Detective-Inspector was making a note or two . " You went over to London especially for the Derwatt show ? " " Oh , no . " Tom smiled a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show , I admit , and the other half because my wife 's birthday is in November , and she likes things from England . Sweaters and trousers . Carnaby Street . I bought something in the Burlington Arcade ? " Tom glanced at the stairway and thought of going up to fetch it , the gold monkey pin , but checked himself . " I did n't buy a Derwatt this time , but I was thinking of buying The Tub . Just about the only one not sold then . " " Did you  --  uh  --  ask Mr. Murchison over with an idea that your paintings could be forgeries also ? " Tom hesitated . " I admit I was curious . But I never doubted  | mine . And after seeing my two , Mr. Murchison thought they were genuine . " Tom certainly was n't going to go into Murchison 's lavender theory . And Inspector Webster did not seem much interested in Tom 's Derwatts , not enough to do more than turn his head to look for a few seconds at The Red Chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of him . " Not my forte , I 'm afraid . Modern painting . You live by yourself , Mr. Ripley ? You and your wife ? " " Yes , except for my housekeeper Mme. Annette . My wife 's in Greece just now . " " I 'd like to meet your housekeeper , " said the Inspector , still smiling . Tom made a start toward the kitchen to fetch Mme. Annette , but just then Chris came down the stairs . " Ah , Chris . This is Detective-Inspector Webster . From London . My guest Christopher Greenleaf . " " How do you do ? " Chris said , extending a hand and looking awed at meeting a member of the London Police . " How do you do ? " Webster said pleasantly , leaning forward to shake Chris 's hand . " Greenleaf . Richard Greenleaf . He was a friend of yours , was he not , Mr. Ripley ? " " Yes . And Chris is his cousin . " Webster must have looked that up recently , Tom thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ripley had any record , because Tom could n't imagine anyone remembering Dickie 's name over a period of six years . " If you 'll excuse me , I 'll call Mme. Annette . " Mme. Annette was peeling something at the sink . Tom asked if she could come in and meet the gentleman from London . " He probably speaks French . " Then as Tom went back into the living room , Bernard was coming downstairs . He wore Tom 's trousers , and a sweater without a shirt . Tom introduced him to Webster . " Mr. Tufts is a painter . From London . " " Oh , " said Webster . " Did you meet Mr. Murchison while you were here ? " " No , " Bernard said , sitting on one of the straight yellowupholstered chairs . " I only arrived yesterday . " Mme. Annette came in . Detective-Inspector Webster stood up , smiled , and said , " En-  | chante , madame . " He continued in perfect French though with a determined British accent , " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Ah , yes ! I read about it only this morning in the newspaper , " Mme. Annette said . " he has not been found ? " " No , madame . " Another smile , as if he were talking about something much more amusing . " It seems that you and M. Ripley were the last people to see him . Or were you here , Mr. Greenleaf ? " he asked Chris in English . Chris stammered , but was indisputably sincere . " I never met Mr. Murchison , no . " " What time did M. Murchison leave the house on Friday , Mme. Annette . Do you remember ? " " Ooh , perhaps ? It was just after lunch . I prepared lunch a little early . Let us say two thirty he left . " Tom remained silent . Mme. Annette was correct . The Inspector said to Tom , " Did he mention any friends at all in Paris ? Excuse me , madame , I can just as well speak in French . " But the conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webster translating for Mme. Annette , because Webster wanted her contributions , if she had any . Murchison had not mentioned anyone in Paris , and Tom said he did not think Murchison had intended to meet anyone at Orly . " You see , the disappearance of Mr. Murchison and his painting  --  this might be connected , " Inspector Webster said . ( Tom explained to Mme. Annette that a painting Murchison had had with him had been stolen at Orly , and Mme. Annette , happily , remembered seeing it standing against the gentleman 's suitcase in the hall before he left . She must have had a very brief glimpse , Tom thought , but it was a piece of luck . Webster might have suspected that Tom had destroyed it . ) " The Derwatt corporation , as I think I have every reason to call it , is a large one . There 's more to it than Derwatt himself , as a painter . Derwatt 's friends , Constant and Banbury , own the Buckmaster Gallery as a sort of sideline to their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Derwatt art supplies company . There 's the Derwatt Art School in Perugia . If we throw forgery into  | all this , then we 've really got something ! " He turned to Bernard . " I think you know Mr. Constant and Mr. Banbury , do n't you , Mr. Tufts ? " And Torn felt another sink of alarm , because Webster really must have dug for that one : Ed Banbury had n't mentioned Bernard 's name in years in his articles as being one of the original group of Derwatt 's friends . " Yes , I know them , " Bernard said in a somewhat dazed manner , but at least he was unruffled . " Did you speak to Derwatt in London ? " Tom asked the Inspector . " He ca n't be found ! " Inspector Webster said , positively beaming now . " Not that I in particular was trying to find him , but one of my colleagues was  --  after Mr. Murchison 's disappearance . What is even more curious ? " Here he switched to French to include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered England lately from Mexico or anywhere else . Not just in the last days , when presumably he arrived in England , but for years back . In fact the last record of the Emigration Bureau says that Philip Derwatt left the country six years ago bound for Greece . We have no record that he ever returned . As you perhaps know , Derwatt was believed to have drowned or committed suicide somewhere in Greece . " Bernard sat forward , forearms on his knees . Was he rallying to the challenge , or about to blurt out all ? " Yes . I 've heard that . " Tom said to Mme. Annette , " We speak about Derwatt the painter  --  his presumed suicide . " " Yes , madame , " Webster said courteously , " excuse us for a moment . Anything important , I shall say in French . " Then to Tom , " So it means Derwatt entered and maybe even left England like the Scarlet Pimpernel or a ghost . " He chuckled . " But you , Mr. Tufts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did you see him in London ? " " No , I did n't . " " But you went to his show , I suppose . " Webster 's smile was in maniacal contrast to Bernard 's gloom . " No . I may go later , " Bernard said solemnly . " I become ? upset about anything to do with Derwatt. "  | Webster seemed to look Bernard over with a new eye . " Why ? " " I 'm  --  very fond of him . I know he does n't like publicity . I thought  --  when all the fuss is over , I 'll go to see him before he goes back to Mexico . " Webster laughed and slapped his thigh . " Well , if you can find him , tell us where he is . We 'd like to speak to him on this matter of possible forgery . I 've spoken to Mr. Banbury and Mr. Constant . They saw The Clock and said it was genuine , but of course they might say that , if I may say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom , " because they sold it . They also said Derwatt identified it positively as his own . But after all I 've only ? now  --  Mr. Banbury 's and Mr. Constant 's word for that , since I ca n't find Derwatt or Mr. Murchison . It would be interesting if Derwatt had disowned it , or maybe was doubtful about it , and ? Oh , well , I 'm not writing mystery stories , even in my imagination ! " Webster gave a hearty laugh , the corners of his mouth went up merrily , and he rolled a little on the sofa . His laugh was infectious and attractive , despite his oversized and somewhat stained teeth . Tom knew what Webster had been going to say : the Buckmaster Gallery people might have seen fit to shut Derwatt up somehow , or spirit him away . Shut Murchison up , too . Tom said , " But Mr. Murchison told me about his conversation with Derwatt . He said Derwatt acknowledged the painting . What worried Mr. Murchison is that he thought Derwatt might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting it . But Derwatt seems to have remembered it . " Now Tom laughed . Detective-Inspector Webster looked at Tom and blinked , and kept what Tom felt was a polite silence . It was the same as saying , " And now I have your word , which might not be worth much . " Webster finally said , " I 'm fairly sure someone for some reason thought it worthwhile to get rid of Thomas Murchison . What else can I think ? " He translated this politely to Mme. Annette . Mme. Annette said , " Tiers ! " and Tom sensed her frisson of horror , though he did not glance at her . Tom was glad that Webster did n't know that he knew Jeff and Ed even slightly . It was funny Webster had n't asked directly  | if he knew them , Tom supposed . Or had Jeff and Ed already told him they knew Tom Ripley slightly , because he 'd bought two pictures from them ? " Mme. Annette , perhaps we might have some coffee . Can I offer you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I saw some Dubonnet on your cart . I 'd love some with a little ice and a lemon peel , if it 's not too much trouble . " Tom conveyed this to Mme. Annette . Nobody wanted coffee . Chris , leaning on the back of a chair near the french windows , did not want anything . He seemed rapt by the goings on . " Exactly why , " Webster said , " did Mr. Murchison think his painting was a forgery ? " Tom sighed thoughtfully . The question had been addressed to him . " He spoke about the spirit of it . Something also about the brushstrokes . " All vague . " I 'm quite sure , " Bernard said , " that Derwatt would not countenance any forgery of his work . It 's out of the question . If he thought The Clock was a forgery , he would 've been the first to say so . He would 've gone straight to the  --  I do n't know ? the police , I suppose . " " Or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " said Bernard firmly . He stood up suddenly . " Would you excuse me a minute ? " He went off toward the stairs . Mme. Annette served Webster 's drink . Bernard came down with a thick brown notebook , quite worn , in which he was trying to find something as he walked across the room . " If you want to know a little about Derwatt  --  I copied several things from his journals here . They were left in a suitcase in London when he went to Greece . I borrowed them for a while . His journals are chiefly about painting , the difficulties he had from day to day , but there 's one entry ? Yes , here it is . It 's seven years old . This is really Derwatt . May I read it ? " " Yes , please do , " said Webster . Bernard read , " ' There is no depression for the artist except that caused by a return to the Self . ' He spells Self with a capital . The Self is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which should never be looked at or looked through .  | A glimpse of it occurs in midstream sometimes , when it is a real horror , and between paintings , and on vacations  --  which should never be taken . ' " Bernard laughed a little . " Such a depression consists in , besides wretchedness , vain questions such as what is it all about ? And the exclamation , how badly I 've fallen short ! And the even worse discovery which I should have noticed long ago , I ca n't even depend on the people who are supposed to love me at a time when I need them . One does n't need them when working well . I must n't show myself in this moment of weakness . It will be , might be , thrown at me at some later date , like a crutch that should have been burnt  --  tonight . Let the memory of the black nights live only in me . ' Next paragraph , " said Bernard with reverence . " Do people who can really talk to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where has kindness , forgiveness gone in the world ? I find more in the faces of children who sit for me , gazing at me , watching me with innocent wide eyes that make no judgement . And friends ? In the moment of grappling with the enemy Death , the potential suicide calls upon them . One by one , they are not at home , the telephone does n't answer , or if it does , they are busy tonight  --  something quite important that they ca n't get away from  --  and one is too proud to break down and say , " I 've got to see you tonight or else ! " This is the last effort to make contact . How pitiable , how human , how noble  --  for what is more godlike than communication ? The suicide knows that it has magical powers . " Bernard closed the notebook . " Of course he was rather young when he wrote that . Still not thirty . " " Very moving , " said the Inspector . " When did you say he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November , " Bernard replied . " He tried a suicide in London in October . He wrote this when he recovered . It was n't a  --  a bad bout . Sleeping pills . " Tom listened uneasily . He had n't heard of Derwatt 's attempted suicide . " Perhaps you think it melodramatic , " Bernard said to the Inspector . " His journals were n't meant for anyone to read . The Buckmaster Gallery has the others . Unless Derwatt asked for them . " Bernard had begun to stammer , to look uncomfortable , probably because he was carefully trying to lie .  | " He 's the suicide type , then ? " asked Webster . " Oh , no ! He has ups and downs . Perfectly normal . I mean , normal for a painter . At the time he wrote this , he was broke . A mural assignment had fallen through , and Derwatt had even finished the mural . The judges turned it down because there were a couple of nudes in it . It was for a post office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no importance now . And oddly , Webster 's face was serious and thoughtful . " I read this to show you that Derwatt is an honest man . " Bernard continued , undaunted . " No dishonest man could have written this  --  or anything else that 's in this book on the subject of painting  --  or simply life . " Bernard thumped the book with the back of his fingers . " I was one of the ones who was too busy to see him when he needed me . I had no idea he was in such a bad state , you see . None of us did . He even needed money , and he was too proud to ask for any . Such a man does n't steal , does n't commit  --  I mean permit forgery . " Tom thought Inspector Webster was going to say , with the solemnity proper to the occasion , " I understand , " but he only sat with splayed knees , still thoughtful , with one hand turned inward on his thigh . " I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the long silence . When no one said anything , Chris ducked his head , then lifted it again , as if ready to defend his opinion . " Any more later entries ? " Webster asked . " I 'm quite interested in what you read , but ? " " One or two , " Bernard said , leafing through the notebook . " But again six years ago . For instance , The eternal falling short is the only thing that takes the terror out of the act of creation . ' Derwatt has always been  --  respectful of his talent . It 's very hard for me to put into words . " " I think I understand , " said Webster . Tom sensed at once Bernard 's severe , almost personal disappointment . He glanced at Mme. Annette , standing discreetly mid-distance from the arched doorway and the sofa . " Did you speak with Derwatt at all in London , even by telephone ? " Webster asked Bernard . " No , " Bernard said .  | " Or with Banbury or Constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't often see them . " No one , Tom thought , could suspect Bernard of lying . He looked the essence of probity . " But you 're on good terms with them ? " Webster asked , cocking his head , looking a little apologetic for the question . " I understand you knew them years ago when Derwatt lived in London . " " Oh , yes . Why not ? ? But I do n't go out much in London . " " Do you know if Derwatt has any friends , " Webster continued to Bernard in his rather gentle voice , " with a helicopter or a boat or a couple of boats who could 've whisked him into England and out again  --  like a Siamese cat or a Pakistani ? " " I do n't know . I certainly do n't know of any . " " Another question , surely you wrote to Derwatt in Mexico when you learned he was alive , did n't you ? " " No , I did n't . " Bernard gulped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As I said , I have little contact with ? Jeff and Ed at the Buckmaster . And they do n't know Derwatt 's village , I know that , because the paintings are sent from Vera Cruz by boat . I thought Derwatt could 've written to me , if he wanted to . Since he did n't , I did n't try to write to him . I felt ? " " Yes ? You felt ? " " I felt Derwatt had been through enough . In his spirit . Maybe in Greece or before Greece . I thought it might have changed him and even soured him on his past friends , and if he did n't want to communicate with me  --  that was his way of doing things , seeing things . " Tom could have wept for Bernard . He was doing his painful best . Bernard was as miserable as someone , who was not an actor , trying to act on a stage and hating every minute of it . Inspector Webster glanced at Tom , then looked at Bernard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I think Derwatt was really fed to the back teeth , " Bernard interrupted , " fed up with people when he went to Mexico . If he wanted seclusion , I did n't make any effort to break it . I could have gone to Mexico and looked for him forever  --  until I found him , I suppose . " : 1  | Tom almost believed the words he had just heard . He must believe them , he told himself . So he began to believe them . Tom went to the bar to refresh Webster 's glass of Dubonnet . " I see . And now  --  when Derwatt leaves again for Mexico , and perhaps he 's already left , you wo n't know where to write to him ? " asked Webster . " Certainly not . I 'll only know that he 's painting and  --  I suppose happy . " " And the Buckmaster Gallery ? They wo n't know where to find him either ? " Bernard shook his head again . " As far as I know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money that he earns ? " " I think  --  to a bank in Mexico City which forwards it to Derwatt . " For this smooth reply , much thanks , thought Tom , as he bent to pour the Dubonnet . He left room in the glass for ice , and brought the bucket from the cart . " Inspector will you stay for lunch with us ? I 've told my housekeeper I expected you would stay . " Mme. Annette had slipped away to the kitchen . " No , no , thank you very much , " Inspector Webster said with a smile . " I 've a lunch appointment with the police of Melun . The only time I could speak with them at leisure , I think . That 's very French , is n't it ? I 'm due in Melun at a quarter to one , so the next thing I should do is ring for a taxi . " Tom rang a Melun taxi service for a cab . " I would like to look around your grounds , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been a change of mood , Tom thought , like someone asking to have a look at the roses by way of escaping a deadly tea conversation , but Tom did n't think it was that . Chris would have followed them , so fascinated was he by the British police , but Tom gave him a negative glance , and went out with the Inspector alone . Down the stone steps where Tom had nearly fallen yesterday , only yesterday , in pursuit of the rain-soaked Bernard . The sun was half-hearted , the grass almost dry . The Inspector shoved his hands into his baggy trousers . Webster might not definitely suspect him of wrongdoing , Tom thought , but he sensed that he was not entirely  | in the clear with Webster . 1 have done the State some disservice and they knoww't . It was an odd morning for Shakespeare to be in his head . " Apple trees . Peach . You must have a wonderful life here . Have you a profession , Mr. Ripley ? " The question was sharp as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it by now . " I garden , paint and study what I please . I have no occupation in the sense of having to go to Paris daily or even weekly . I seldom go to Paris . " Tom picked up a stone that was marring his lawn , and aimed it at a tree trunk . The stone hit the tree with a tock , and Tom suffered a twinge in his turned ankle . " And woods . Are these yours ? " " No . As far as I know , they 're communal . Or State . I sometimes get a bit of firewood from them , kindling , from trees that 've already fallen . Do you want to take a little walk ? " Tom indicated the lane . Inspector Webster did go five or six steps farther toward the lane , into it , but having glanced down the lane , he turned . " Not just now , thank you . I 'd better be looking out for my taxi , I think . " The taxi was at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inspector , and so did Chris . Tom wished him " Bon appetit . " " Fascinating ! " Chris said . " Really ! Did you show him the grave in the woods ? I was n't looking out the windows , because I thought it would be rude . " Tom smiled . " No . " " I started to mention it , then I thought I 'd be an idiot if I did . Bringing in false clues , " Chris laughed . Even his teeth were like Dickie 's , sharp eyeteeth and the rest set rather narrowly in his mouth . " Imagine the Inspector digging it up looking for Murchison ! " Chris went off again . Tom laughed , too . " Yes , if I dropped him at Orly , how 'd he get back here ? " " Who killed him ? " Chris asked . " I do n't think he 's dead , " said Tom . " Kidnapped ? "  | " I du n no . Maybe . Along with his painting . I du n no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went upstairs . " Tom went upstairs to see him . Bernard 's door was closed . Tom knocked and heard a mumble in response . Bernard was sitting on the edge of the bed with his hands clasped . He looked defeated and exhausted . Tom said as cheerfully as he could , or as he dared , " That went well , Bernard . Tout va bien . " " I failed , " Bernard said , with miserable eyes . " What 're you talking about ? You were marvelous . " " I failed . That 's why he asked all those questions about Derwatt . About how to find him in Mexico . Derwatt failed and so did I. "  | It was one of the worst lunches Tom had ever sat through , matching almost the lunch with Heloise and her parents after Heloise had told them they were already married . But at least this lunch did not last so long . Bernard was in the hopeless depression of an actor , Tom supposed , who had just given a performance that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bernard was suffering the exhaustion  --  Tom had known it  --  of the player who has given his all . " You know , last night , " Chris said , finishing the last of a glass of milk which he drank along with wine , " I saw a car backing out of that lane in the woods . Must 've been about one . I do n't suppose it 's important . The car was backing with the minimum of lights on , like someone who did n't want to be seen . " Tom said , " Probably  --  lovers . " He was afraid Bernard would react somehow  --  how ? ? to this , but Bernard might not have heard it . Bernard excused himself and got up . " Gosh , it 's a shame he 's so upset , " Chris said when Bernard was out of earshot . " I 'll take off right away . I hope I have n't stayed too long . " Tom wanted to check on the afternoon trains , but Chris had  | a different idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no dissuading him . Chris was convinced it would be an adventure . The alternative was a train close to 5 , Tom knew . Chris came downstairs with his suitcases , and went into the kitchen to say good-bye to Mme. Annette . Then they went out to the garage . " Please , " Chris said , " say good-bye for me to Bernard , would you ? His door was shut . I had the feeling he does n't want to be disturbed , but I do n't want him to think I 'm rude . " Tom assured him he would make things all right with Bernard . Tom took the Alfa-Romeo . " You can drop me anywhere , really , " Chris said . Tom thought Fontainebleau was the best bet , the highway to Paris by the Monument . Chris looked like what he was , a tall American boy on vacation , neither rich nor poor , and Tom thought he would have no trouble getting a lift into Paris . " Shall I can you in a couple of days ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's happening . I 'll look at the papers , too , of course . " " Yes , " Tom said . " Let me ring you . Hotel Louisiane , Rue de Seine , is n't it ? " " Yes. ? I ca n't tell you how wonderful it 's been for me ? just seeing the inside of a French house . " Yes , he could . Or rather , he did n't have to tell him , Tom thought . On the way home , Tom drove faster then usual . He felt very worried , but he did not know exactly what he ought to be worried about . He felt out of touch with Jeff and Ed , and for him or them to try to communicate would be unwise . He thought it best to try to persuade Bernard to stay on . It might be difficult . But going back to London would mean the Derwatt show in Bernard 's face again , posters on the streets , perhaps seeing Jeff and Ed who were frightened and off-balance now themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to Bernard 's room and knocked . No answer . Tom opened the door . The bed was made as it had been made that morning when Bernard sat on it , and now Tom saw the faint depression in the bedspread where Bernard had sat . But everything of Bernard 's was gone , his duffelbag , his un-  | pressed suit which Tom had put in the closet . Tom took a quick look in his own room . Bernard was not there . And there was no note anywhere . Mme. Clusot was vacuuming in his room , and Tom said , " Bon jour , madame , " to her . Tom went downstairs . " Mme. Annette ! " Mme. Annette was not in the kitchen , she was in her bedroom , and Tom knocked , and hearing a word from her , opened the door . Mme. Annette was reclining on her bed under a mauve knitted coverlet , reading Marie-Claire . " Do n't disturb yourself , madame ! " Tom said . " I only wanted to ask where is M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Perhaps he has gone out for a walk . " Tom did not want to tell her that he appeared to have taken his things and left . " He did n't say anything to you ? " " No , m'sieur . " " Well ? " Tom managed a smile . " Let 's not worry about it . ? Were there any telephone calls ? " " No , m'sieur . And how many will there be for dinner this evening ? " " Two , I think , thank you , Mme. Annette , " Tom said , thinking that Bernard might be back . He went out and closed the door . My God , Tom thought , plunge into a couple of soothing Goethe poems . Der Abschied or some such . A little German solidity , Goethian conviction of superiority and  --  maybe genius . That was what he needed . Tom pulled the book down ? Goethes Gedichte  --  from a shelf , and as fate or the unconscious would have it , he opened the book at Der Abschied . Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have dared recite it to anyone , being afraid his accent was not perfect . Now the first lines upset him : Lass mein Aug ' den Abschied sagen , Den mein Mund nicht neh7nen kann ! Let my eyes say the adieu that my mouth can not . Schwer , wie schwer ist er zu tragen ! Und ich bin Tom was startled by the closing of a car door . Someone was arriving . Bernard had taken a taxi back , Tom thought .  | But no , it was Heloise . She stood bareheaded , her long blond hair blowing in the breeze , fumbling with her purse . Tom bolted for the door and flung it open . " Heloise ! " " Ah , Tome ! " They embraced . Ah , Tome , ah , Tome ! Tom had grown used to this bookish name , and from Heloise , he liked it . " You 're all sunburned ! " Tom said in English , but he meant suntanned . " Let me get rid of this guy . How much is it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From Orly he 's ? " Tom repressed , even in English , the words he had been going to use . Tom paid the bill . The driver did not assist with the luggage . Tom took everything into the house . " Ah , how good to be home ! " Heloise said , stretching her arms . She flung a big tapestry-like bag  --  a Greek product ? onto the yellow sofa . She was wearing brown leather sandals , pink bell-bottomed trousers , an American Navy pea-jacket . Tom wondered where and how she had acquired the pea-jacket ? " All is well . Mme. Annette is at ease in her bedroom , " Tom said , switching to French . " What a terrible vacation I had ! " Heloise plopped on the sofa and lit a cigarette . She would take several minutes to calm down , so he started to carry her suitcases upstairs . She screamed at one of them , because there was something in it which belonged downstairs , so Tom left that and took something else . " Must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the alternative ? Standing and waiting for her to unwind ? " Yes . " He took the other things to her room . When he came down , Mme. Annette was in the living room , and she and Heloise were talking about Greece , the yacht , the house there ( evidently in a small fishing village ) , but not , Tom noticed , about Murchison as yet . Mme. Annette was fond of Heloise , because Mme. Annette liked to be of service to people , and Heloise liked to be served . Heloise did not want anything now , though at Mme. Annette 's insistence , she agreed to a cup of tea . Then Heloise told him about her vacation on the Princesse de  | Grece , the yacht of the oaf called Zeppo , a name which recalled the Marx Brothers to Tom . Tom had seen pictures of this hairy beast , whose self-esteem matched that of any of the Greek shipping tycoons , from what Tom could gather , and Zeppo was only the son of a minor real estate shark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , himself already screwed by the Fascist colonels there , according to Zeppo and Heloise , yet still making so much money that his son could cruise around on a yacht throwing caviar to the fish and filling the yacht 's swimming pool with champagne , which they later heated so they could swim in it . " Zeppo had to hide the champagne , so he put it in the pool , " Heloise explained . " And who was in bed with Zeppo ? Not the wife of the President of the United States , I trust . " " Any-body , " Heloise said in English , with disgust , and blew her smoke out . Not Heloise , Tom was sure . Heloise was sometimes  --  not even too often  --  a tease , but Tom was sure she had not jumped into bed with anyone but him since they were married . Thank God , not Zeppo , who was a gorilla . Heloise would never go for that . Zeppo 's treatment of women sounded repellent , but Tom 's attitude to that  --  which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if women put up with it from the start , in order to get a diamond bracelet or a villa in the south of France , why should they complain about it later ? Heloise 's main irritation seemed to be due to the jealousy of one woman named Norita , because a certain man on the yacht had been paying attention to Heloise . Tom scarcely listened to this gossip-column drivel , because he was thinking how to tell Heloise some of his news in a manner that would n't upset her . Tom was also half-expecting Bernard 's gaunt figure to appear at the front door at any moment . He walked up and down the floor slowly , glancing at the front door at each turn . " I went to London . " " Yes ? How was it ? " " I brought you something . " Tom ran up the stairs  --  his ankle was much better  --  and returned with the Carnaby Street trousers . Heloise put them on in the dining room . They fitted well .  | " I love them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a kiss on his cheek . " I came back with a man called Thomas Murchison , " Tom said , and proceeded to tell her what had happened . Heloise had not heard of his disappearance . Tom explained Murchison 's suspicion of his Clock as a forgery , and Tom said he was convinced there was no forgery being done of Derwatt 's paintings , and so , like the police , he could not account for Murchison 's disappearance . Just as Heloise did not know about the forging , she did not know how much of an income Tom derived from Derwatt , Ltd. , about $8000 per year , about the same as the income from the stocks he had acquired from Dickie Greenleaf . Heloise was interested in money , but not particularly in where it came from . She knew her family 's money contributed as much to their household as Tom 's , but she had never thrown this up to Tom , and Tom knew she could n't have cared less , which was another thing he appreciated in Heloise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving him a small percentage of their profits , because he had helped them organize their business years ago , before he and Heloise met . Tom 's Derwatt , Ltd. income was sent to him , or handled by the New York company which was a distributor of the Derwatt-labeled art supplies . Some of this Tom invested in New York , and some he had sent to France to be turned into francs . The head of the Derwatt art supply company ( who also happened to be a Greek ) was aware that Derwatt did not exist and was being falsified . Tom continued : " Another matter . Bernard Tufts ? I do n't think you ever met him  --  was visiting for a couple of days , and just this afternoon he appears to have taken a walk  --  with his things . I do n't know if he 's coming back or not . " " Bernard Toofts ? Un anglais ? " Yes . I do n't know him well . He 's a friend of friends . He 's a painter , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's probably gone off to Paris . I thought I should tell you about him in case he comes back . " Tom laughed . He felt more and more convinced that Bernard would not come back . Had he taken a taxi , perhaps , to Orly to hop the first plane he could back to London ? " And  --  my other news is we 're invited tomor-  | row night to the Berthelins for dinner . They 'll be enchanted that you 're back ! Oh , I almost forgot . I had still another guest ? Christopher Greenleaf , a cousin of Dickie 's . He was here two nights . Did n't you get my letter about him ? " But she had n't , because he had sent it only Monday . " Mon dieu , you have been busy ! " Heloise said in English , with a funny edge of jealousy in it . " Did you miss me , Tome ? " He put his arms around her . " I missed you  --  really I did . " The item Heloise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sturdy with two handles , and two black bulls on it lowering their heads at each other . It was attractive , and Tom did not ask if it was valuable , very old , or anything else , because at that moment he did not care . He put on Vivaldi 's Four Seasons . Heloise was upstairs unpacking , and she said she wanted to take a bath . By 6:3o P.M. Bernard had not arrived . Tom had a feeling Bernard was in Paris , not London , but it was only a feeling , something he should n't count on . During dinner , which he and Heloise took at home , Mme. Annette chatted with Heloise about the English gentleman who had come that morning to ask about M. Murchison . Heloise was interested but only slightly , and certainly she was n't worried , Tom saw . She was more interested in Bernard . " You expect him back ? Tonight ? " " In fact  --  now I do n't , " Tom said . Thursday morning came and went tranquilly , without even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four people in Paris , including her father at his Paris office . Now Heloise wore faded levis and she went barefoot in the house . There was nothing in Mme. Annette 's Parisien today about Murchison . When Mme. Annette went out in the afternoon  --  ostensibly to shop , but probably to call on her friend Mme. Yvonne and inform her of Heloise 's arrival and of the visit of an agent of the London police ? Tom lay with Heloise on the yellow sofa , drowsily , his head against her breast . They had made love that morning . Amazing . It was supposed to be a dramatic fact . It was not so important to Tom as having fallen asleep with Heloise the night before , with Heloise in his arms . Heloise often said , " You are nice to sleep with , because when you turn over  | it is not like an earthquake shaking the bed . Really I do n't know when you turn over . " That pleased Tom . He had never even asked who the earthquakes had been . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not make out her objectives in life . She was like a picture on the wall . She might want children , sometime , she said . Meanwhile , she existed . Not that Tom could boast of having any objectives himself , now that he had attained the life he had now , but Tom had a certain zest in seizing the pleasures he was now able to seize , and this zest seemed lacking in Heloise , maybe because she had had everything she wished since birth . Tom felt odd sometimes making love with her , because he felt detached half the time , and as if he derived pleasure from something inanimate , unreal , from a body without an identity . Or was this some shyness or puritanism on his part ? Or some fear of ( mentally ) giving himself completely , which would be to say to himself , " If I should not have , if I should lose Heloise , I could n't exist any longer . " Tom knew he was capable of believing that , even in regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself , did not permit it , and had certainly never said it to Heloise , because it would ( as things were now ) be a lie . The condition of utter dependence on her he sensed merely as a possibility . It had little to do with sex , Tom thought , with any dependence on that . Usually Heloise was disrespectful of the same things he was . She was a partner , in a way , though a passive one . With a boy or a man , Tom would have laughed more  --  maybe that was the main difference . Yet Tom remembered one occasion with her parents , when he 'd said , " I 'm sure every member of the Mafia is baptised , and what good does it do them ? " and Heloise had laughed . Her parents had n't . They ( the parents ) had somehow ferreted out of Tom the fact that he had n't been baptised in the United States  --  a point Tom actually was vague about , but certainly his Aunt Dottie had never mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very small , so he 'd never heard anything on the subject from them . Impossible to explain to the Plissons , who were Catholics , that in the United States baptism and mass and confession and pierced ears and Hell and the Mafia were sort of , somehow , Catholic and not Protestant , not that Tom was any-  | thing , but if he was sure of anything , he was sure he was n't Catholic . The times that Heloise came most alive to Tom were when she flew into a temper . She had tempers and tempers . Tom did not count the tempers over a delayed delivery of something from Paris , when Heloise swore ( untruthfully ) that she would never patronize such-and-such a shop again . The more serious tempers were caused by boredom or a minor assault upon her ego , and could occur if a guest had bested or contradicted her in a discussion at the table . Heloise would control herself until the guest or guests had departed  --  which was something ? but once the people had gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing pillows at the walls , shouting , " Fous viol la paix ! ? Salauds ! " ( Get the hell out of here ! ? Slobs ! " ) with Tom as her only audience . Tom would say something soothing and irrelevant , Heloise would go limp , a tear would roll out of each eye , and she could be laughing a moment later . Tom supposed that was Latin . It certainly was n't English . Tom worked for an hour or so in the garden , then read a bit in Les Armes Secretes by Julio Cortazar . Then he went up and did the last work on his portrait of Mme. Annette  --  this was her day off , Thursday . At 6 P.M. Tom asked Heloise to come in and look at it . " It 's not bad , you know ? You have not worked too much on it . I like that . " Tom was pleased by this . " Do n't mention it to Madame . " He put it in a corner to dry , face to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Berthelins . Dress was informal . Levis would do . Vincent was another husband who worked in Paris and came to his country house on weekends . " What has Papa to say ? " Tom asked . " He is glad I am back in France . " Papa did n't like him much , Tom knew , but Papa had a vague feeling that Heloise neglected him . Bourgeois virtue was at war with a nose for character , Tom supposed . " And Noelle ? " Noelle was a favorite friend of Heloise who lived in Paris . " Oh , the same . Bored , she says . She never likes the autumn . " The Berthelins , though quite well off , deliberately roughed it  | in the country , with an outside john , and no hot water in the kitchen sink . Hot water was made in a kettle on the stove which burnt wood . Their guests the Cleggs , the English couple , were about fifty , the same age as the Berthelins . Vincent Berthelin 's son , whom Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of twenty-two ( Vincent told Torn his age in the kitchen , when he and Torn were drinking Ricards , and Vincent was doing the cooking ) , living with a girl friend now in Paris , and on the brink of abandoning his architectural studies at the Beaux Arts , which had Vincent in a tizzy . " The girl is not worth it ! " Vincent stormed at Tom . " It is the English influence , you know ? " Vincent was a Gaullist . The dinner was excellent , chicken , rice , salad , cheese , and apple tart made by Jacqueline . Tom 's mind was on other things . But he was pleased , pleased to the point of smiling , because Heloise was in good spirits , talking about her Greek adventures , and at the last they all sampled the ouzo Heloise had brought . " Disgusting taste , that ouzo ! Worse than Pernod ! " said Heloise at home , brushing her teeth at the basin in her bathroom . She was already in her nightdress , a short blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his new pajamas from London . " I 'm going down to get some champagne ! " Heloise called . " I 'll get it . " Tom hurried into his slippers . " I have to get this taste out . Besides I want some champagne . You would think the Berthelins were paupers , the things they serve to drink . Vin ordinaire ! " She was going down the stairs . Tom intercepted her . " I shall get it , " Heloise said . " Get some ice . " Tom somehow did n't want her to go into the cellar . He went on to the kitchen . He had just pulled an ice tray out , when he heard a scream  --  a muffled scream because of the distance , but Heloise 's scream , and a terrible one . Tom dashed across the front hall . There was a second scream , and he collided with her in the spare loo . " Mon dieu ! Someone has hanged himself down there ! "  | " Oh , Christ ! " Tom half-supported Heloise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go down , Tome ! It is horrible ! " It was Bernard , of course . Tom was trembling as he walked up the stairs with her , she talking in French and he in English . " Promise me you wo n't go down ! Call the police , Tome ! " " All right , I 'll call the police . " " Who is it ? " " I do n't know . " They went into Heloise 's bedroom . " Stay here ! " Tom said . " No , do n't leave me ! " " I insist ! " Tom said in French , and ran out and down the stairs . A straight scotch was the best thing , he thought . Heloise hardly drank spirits , so it ought to help her at once . Then a sedative . Tom ran back upstairs with the bottle and a glass from the bar cart . He poured half a glassful , and when Heloise hesitated , drank some himself , then put the glass between her lips . Her teeth were chattering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ! " Was there blood , he wondered . More blood ? He hated blood . No matter , Bernard was dead . And he would have to face it , without the police . At least this was suicide , Tom thought . That ought to be provable . It was n't murder . Tom sighed , shuddering , almost as shaky as Heloise . She was sitting on the edge of the bed . " How about the champagne ? A lot of it . " " Yes. ? Non ! You must not go down there ! Telephone the police ! " " Yes . " Tom went down the stairs . He went into the spare loo , hesitated just an instant at the open doorway  --  the cellar light was still on  --  then started down the steps . A shock went through him at the sight of the dark , hanging figure , head askew . The rope was short . Tom blinked . There seemed to be no feet . He went closer . It was a dummy . Tom smiled , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were nothing but empty trousers , the trousers of Bernard Tufts . " Heloise ! " he yelled , running back up the stairs ,  | not caring if he might waken Mme. Annette . " Heloise , it 's a dummy ! " he said in English . " It 's not real ! C'est un mannequin ! You must n't be afraid ! " It took a few seconds to convince her . It was a joke that perhaps Bernard had played  --  perhaps even Christopher , Tom added . At any rate , he had felt the legs , and he was sure . Gradually , Heloise became angry , which was a sign of recovery . " What stupid jokes these English play ! Stupid ! Imbecilic ! " Tom laughed with relief . " I 'm going down to get the champagne ! And the ice ! " Tom went down again . The dummy hung from a belt which Tom recognized as one of his own . A hanger supported the dark gray jacket , the trousers were buttoned onto a button of the jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the neck with a string . Tom got a chair quickly from the kitchen ? happily Mme. Annette had not awakened in all this  --  and returned to the cellar and took the thing down . The belt had hung from a nail in a rafter . Tom dropped the empty clothes on the floor . Then he chose a champagne quickly . He removed the hanger from the jacket , and took the belt with him . He managed to take the ice bucket from the kitchen also , and to turn out the lights , and then he went upstairs .  | Tom awakened just before 7 . Heloise was sleeping soundly . Torn got gently out of bed , and took his dressing gown which was hanging in Heloise 's bedroom . Mme. Annette might be up . Tom went quietly down the stairs . He wanted to remove Bernard 's suit from the cellar before Mme. Annette found it . The stain of the spilt wine and Murchison 's blood , Tom saw now , was not serious . If a technician examined it for blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was optimistic enough to think this would not happen . He unbuttoned the jacket from the trousers . A piece of white paper fluttered down , a note from Bernard , written in his tall pointed hand : I hang myself in effigy in your house . It is Bernard Tufts that I hang , not Derwatt . For D. I do penance in the only way I can , which is to kill the self I have been for the last five years . Nov to continue and try to do my work honestly in what is left of my life . B.T. Tom had an impulse to crumple the note and destroy it . Then he folded it , and stuck it in a pocket of his dressing  | gown . He might need it . Who knew ? Who knew where Bernard was and what he was doing ? He shook out Bernard 's crumpled suit , and tossed the rag in a corner . He 'd send the suit to the cleaners . No harm in that . Tom started to take it up to his room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he put clothes for Mme. Annette to take to the cleaners . " Bon jour , M. Tome ! " Mme. Annette said from the kitchen . " Again you are up early ! Mme. Heloise also ? Would she like her tea ? " Tom went to the kitchen . " I think she wants to sleep this morning . She should sleep as late as she wishes . But I 'd like some coffee now , please . " Mme. Annette said she would bring it up to him . Tom went upstairs and dressed . He wanted to take a look at the grave in the woods . Bernard might have done something odd  --  opened it partly , God knew what  --  maybe even buried himself in it . After his coffee , he went downstairs . The sun was hazy and hardly up , the grass wet with dew . Tom idled by his shrubs , not wanting to make a bee-line for the grave , in case Heloise or Mme. Annette was looking out a window . Tom did not look back at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye of another . The grave was just as he and Bernard had left it . Heloise did not awaken until after to , and Mme. Annette told Tom , who was in his workroom then , that Mme. Heloise wanted to see him . Tom went into her bedroom . She was having her tea in bed . She said , chewing grapefruit , " I do not like the jokes of your friends . " " There wo n't be any more . I removed the clothes  --  from the cellar . Do n't think any more about that . Would you like to go to a nice place for lunch ? Somewhere along the Seine ? A late lunch ? " She liked this idea . They found a restaurant new to them in a small town to the south , not on the Seine as it happened . " Shall we go away somewhere ? To Ibiza ? " Heloise asked . Tom hesitated . He would love to go somewhere by boat , take all the luggage he wanted , books , a record player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like an evasion , he felt , to Bernard , to Jeff and Ed , and to the police  --  even if they knew where he was going . " I will think about it . Maybe . " " Greece left an unpleasant taste . Like the ouzo , " Heloise said . Tom was in the mood for a lovely snooze after lunch . So was Heloise . They would sleep in her bed , she said , until they woke up , or until time for dinner . Unplug the telephone in Tom 's room , so it would only ring downstairs , and Mme. Annette would answer it . It was at moments like these , Tom thought as he drove lazily back through the woods toward Villeperce , that he enjoyed being jobless , rather well-off , and married . Tom was certainly not prepared for what he saw as soon as he opened the front door with his key . Bernard was sitting in one of the yellow straight chairs , facing the door . Heloise did not see Bernard at once , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some Perrier and ice ? Oh , I am so sle-epy ! " Heloise fell into Tom 's arms , and was surprised to find him tense . " Bernard 's here . You know , the Englishman I mentioned . " Tom walked into the living room . " Hello , Bernard . How are you ? " Tom could not quite extend a hand , but he tried to smile . Mme. Annette came in from the kitchen . " Ah , M. Tome ! Mme. Heloise ! I did not hear the car . I must be growing deaf . M. Bernard has returned . " Mme. Annette seemed flustered . Tom said as calmly as he could , " Yes . Good . I was expecting him , " though he had told Mme. Annette he was n't sure Bernard would come back , he remembered . Bernard stood up . He needed a shave . " Pardon me for returning unannounced . " " Heloise , this is Bernard Tufts  --  a painter who lives in London . My wife Heloise . " " How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was . " How do you do ? " she replied in English . " My wife 's a little tired . " Tom walked toward her . " Want to go upstairs  --  or stay with us ? "  | With a motion of her head , Heloise asked Tom to come with her . " Back in a moment , Bernard , " Tom said , and followed her . " Is that the one who played the trick ? " Heloise asked when they were in her bedroom . " I 'm afraid so . He 's rather eccentric . " " What is he doing here ? I do n't like him . Who is he ? You never mentioned him before . And he 's wearing your clothes ? " Tom shrugged . " He 's a friend of some friends of mine in London . I 'm sure I can persuade him to take off this afternoon . ? He probably needs some extra money . Or clothes . I 'll ask him . " Tom kissed her cheek . " Get into bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom went to the kitchen and asked Mine . Annette to take up Heloise 's Perrier . " M. Bernard will be here for dinner ? " asked Mme. Annette . " I do n't think so . But we shall be in . Something simple . We had a big lunch . " Tom went back to Bernard . " Were you in Paris ? " " Yes , Paris . " Bernard was still standing . Tom did n't know what tack to take . " I found your effigy downstairs . It gave my wife quite a shock . You should n't play tricks like that  --  with women in the house . " Tom smiled . " By the way , my housekeeper took your suit to be cleaned and I 'll see that you get it in London  --  or wherever you are . Sit down . " Tom sat down on the sofa . " What 're your plans ? " It was like asking an insane man how he felt , Tom thought . Tom was uneasy , and he felt worse when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down . " Oh ? " Long pause . " Not going back to London ? " In desperation , Tom took a cigar from the box on the coffee table . It was enough to gag him just now , but did it matter ? " I came to talk to you . " " All right. ? What about ? " Another silence , and Tom was afraid to break it . Bernard might have been groping in clouds , infinite clouds of his own thoughts in the last days . It was as if he were trying to hunt down one fleecy little sheep amid a gigantic flock , Tom felt .  | " I have all the time you want . You 're among friends , Bernard . " " It 's quite simple . I must start my life over again . Cleanly . " " Yes , I know. ? Well , you can . " " Does your wife know  --  about my forging ? " Tom welcomed this logical question . " No , of course not . No one knows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I told her Murchison was missing . And that I dropped him at Orly . " Tom spoke softly , in case Heloise might be in the hall upstairs , listening . But he knew voices did not carry well from the living room , up the faraway curve of the stairs . Bernard said somewhat irritably , " I really ca n't talk with other people in the house . Like your wife . Or the housekeeper . " " All right , we can go somewhere . " " No . " " Well , I can hardly ask Mme. Annette to leave . She runs this place . Want to take a walk ? There 's a quiet cafe ? " " No , thanks . " Tom leaned back on the sofa with his cigar , which now smelled like a house burning down . Usually he liked the smell . " By the way , I 've heard nothing from the English inspector since I saw you . Or the French . " Bernard showed no reaction . Then he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stood up and looked at the french windows . " Out the back way , perhaps . " They walked out , onto the lawn . Neither had put on a topcoat and it was chilly . Tom let Bernard go where he wished , and Bernard drifted toward the woods , toward the lane . Bernard walked slowly , a bit unsteadily . Was he weak from not having eaten , Tom wondered ? Soon they were passing the spot where Murchison 's corpse had been . Tom felt fear , a fear that made the hair on his neck and behind his ears prickle . It was not a fear of that spot , Tom realized , but a fear of Bernard . Tom kept his hands free , and walked a little to one side of Bernard . Then Bernard slowed and turned around , and they began walking back toward the house . " What 's on your mind ? " Tom asked .  | " Oh , I ? I do n't know where this thing 's going to end . It 's already caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes . I agree . But really nothing to do with you , is it ? Since you 're not painting any more Derwatts , the new Bernard Tufts can start over  --  cleanly . " No reply from Bernard . " Did you ring Jeff or Ed when you were in Paris ? " " No . " Tom had n't troubled to buy any English newspapers , and Bernard perhaps had n't troubled , either . Bernard 's anxieties were within himself . " If you 'd like to , you can ring Cynthia from the house . You can do it from my room . " " I spoke to her from Paris . She does n't want to see me . " " Oh . " That was the trouble . That was the last straw , Tom supposed . " Well , you can always write her . That may be better . Or see her when you go back to London . Storm her door ! " Tom laughed . " She said no . " Silence . Cynthia wanted to keep clean of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's intention of stopping the forgeries ? no one could doubt Bernard when he stated something  --  but she 'd had enough . Bernard 's hurt was beyond Tom 's grasp , for the moment . They were standing on the stone terrace outside the french windows . " I 've got to go in , Bernard . I 'm freezing . Come in . " Tom opened the doors . Bernard came in , too . Tom ran up to see Heloise . He was still rigid with cold , or fear . Heloise was in her bedroom , sitting on her bed , sorting snapshots and postcards . " When is he leaving ? " " Darling  --  it 's his girl friend in London . He rang her from Paris . She does n't want to see him . He 's unhappy and I ca n't just ask him to leave. ? I do n't know what he 's going to do. ? Darling , would you like to visit your parents for a few days ? " " Non ! " " He wants to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it soon . "  | " Why ca n't you put him out ? He is not your friend . Also he is mad ! " Bernard stayed . They had not finished dinner when the front doorbell sounded . Mme. Annette answered it , and returned and said to Tom : " It is two agents of police , M. Tome . They would like to speak with you . " Heloise gave a sigh of impatience , and threw her napkin down . She had detested sitting at the table , and now she stood up . " Again some intrusions ! " she said in French . Tom had stood up , too . Only Bernard seemed unperturbed . Tom went into the living room . It was the same pair of agents who had visited him Monday . " We are sorry to disturb you , m'sieur , " said the older man , " but your telephone is not working . We have reported it . " " Really ? " The telephone non-functioning happened , in fact , every six weeks or so , inexplicably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd , like cut the line . " I was not aware of it . Thank you . " " We have been in touch with the English inspector . Rather he has been in touch with us . " Heloise came in , out of both curiosity and anger , Tom supposed . Tom introduced her , and the officers gave their names again , Com.n issaire Delaunay , and the other name Tom missed . Delaunay said , " Now it is not merely M. Murchison but the painter Derwatt who is missing . The English Inspector Webstair , who also tried to ring you this afternoon , would like to know if you have heard from either of them ? " Tom smiled , actually a little amused . " I have never met Derwatt , and he certainly does not know me , " Tom said , just as Bernard came into the room . " And I have had no word from M. Murchison , I regret to say. ? May I present Bernard Tufts , an English friend . Bernard , two gentlemen of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernard 's name did not mean anything to the French police , Tom noticed . " Even the people who own the gallery where Derwatt now has an exhibition do not know where Derwatt is , " said Delaunay . " It is astounding , this . " It was indeed odd , but Tom could not help them at all . " Do you by any chance know the American , M. Murchison ? " Delaunay asked Bernard . " No , " Bernard said . " Or you , madame ? " " No , " Heloise said . Tom explained that his wife had just returned from Greece , but he had told her about M. Murchison 's visit and his disappearance . The officers looked as if they did not know what move to make next . Delaunay said , " Because of the circumstances , M. Reeply , we have been asked by Inspector Webstair to make a search of your house . A formality , you understand , but necessary . We might come across a clue. ? I speak of M. Murchison , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ! " " But certainly ! Would you like to begin now ? " It was rather dark , as far as the outdoors was concerned , but the police said they would begin now , and continue tomorrow morning . Both officers stood on the stone terrace , looking longingly , Tom felt , at the dark garden and the woods beyond . They went over the house , under Tom 's guidance . They were first interested in Murchison 's bedroom , the one Chris had used afterward . Mme. Annette had emptied the wastebasket . The officers looked into drawers , all of which were empty except for two bottom drawers of a chest , or commode as the French called it , which contained bedspreads and a couple of blankets . There was no sign of Murchison or Chris . They looked into Heloise 's bedroom . ( Heloise was downstairs in a repressed fury , Tom knew . ) They looked into Tom 's atelier , even picked up one of his saws . There was an attic . The light had burned out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from downstairs . The attic was dusty . There were chairs under cloth covers , and an old sofa that Tom and Heloise had not removed from previous tenants . The policemen also looked behind things with the  | aid of their own torches . They were looking for something larger than a clue , Tom supposed , absurd as the idea might be that he would leave a corpse behind a sofa . Then it was the cellar . Tom showed it with the same ease , standing right on the stain , and shining his torch into the corners , though the light was good . Tom was a bit afraid Murchison might have bled onto the cement floor behind the wine cask . Tom had not looked at that spot carefully enough . But if there was any blood , the officers did not see it , and gave the floor only a glance . This did not mean they would not make a more thorough search tomorrow , Tom thought . They said they would be back at 8 in the morning , if that was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be quite all right . " Sorry , " Tom said to Heloise and Bernard , when he had closed the front door . Tom had the feeling Heloise and Bernard had been sitting in silence with their coffee the whole time . " Why do they want to search the house ? " Heloise demanded . " Because this so-and-so American is still missing , " Tom said . " M. Murchison . " Heloise stood up . " Can I speak to you upstairs , Tome . " Tom excused himself to Bernard and went with her . Heloise went into her bedroom . " If you do n't put this fou out , I am leaving the house tonight ! " That was a dilemma . He wanted Heloise to stay , and yet if she did , Tom knew he would get nowhere with Bernard . And like Bernard , he could n't think with Heloise 's indignant eyes glaring at him . " I 'll try again to get him out , " Tom said . He kissed Heloise on the neck . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Heloise is upset . Would you mind going back to Paris tonight ? I could drive you to ? Why not Fontainebleau ? A couple of good hotels there . If you want to talk to me , I could come tomorrow to Fontainebleau ? " " No . " Tom sighed . " Then she 'll take off tonight . I 'll go and tell her . " Tom went back up the stairs and told Heloise . " What is this , another Dickie Granelafe ? You ca n't tell him to get out of your house ? " " I never  --  Dickie was n't in my house . " Tom stopped , word-  | less . Heloise looked angry enough to oust Bernard herself , but she would n't be able to , Tom thought , because Bernard 's adamance was beyond convention or etiquette . She dragged a small leather suitcase down from the top of a closet and began to pack . Useless to say he felt responsible for Bernard , Tom supposed . Heloise would wonder why . " Heloise , darling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you want me to drive you to the station ? " " I take the Alfa to Chantilly . By the way , there is nothing wrong with the telephone . I just tried it in your room . " " Maybe the word from the flies got it fixed . " " I think maybe they lied . They wanted to surprise us . " She paused in the act of putting a shirt into her suitcase . " What have you done , Tome ? Did you do something to this Murchison ? " " No ! " Tom said , startled . " You know , my father is not going to support any more nonsense , any more scandal . " She referred to the Greenleaf business . Tom had cleared his name there , to be sure , but there were always suspicions . The Latins made wild jokes , and the jokes in a curious way became Latin truths . Tom might have killed Dickie . And everyone knew that he derived some money from Dickie 's death , much as Tom had tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Dickie , and so did Heloise 's father , whose own hands were not immaculate in his business activities , but Tom 's had , perhaps , blood on them . Ora non olet , sed sangua .. . " There wo n't be any more scandal , " Tom said . " If you only knew , I 'm trying my best to avoid scandal . That 's my objective . " She closed her suitcase . " I never know what you are doing . " Tom took the suitcase . Then he set it down and they embraced . " I would like to be with you tonight . " Heloise would have liked to be with him , too , and she did not have to say it in words . This was the other side of her f ous-nzoi-le-camp ! Now she was leaving . Frenchwomen had to leave a room , a house , or ask someone else to change his room , or go somewhere , and the more inconvenient it was for the other person , the better they liked it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screaming . Tom called it " The Law of French Displacement . " " Did you telephone your family ? " Tom asked . " If they are not there , the servants are there . " It would take her nearly two hours to drive . " Will you ring me when you get there ? " " Au revoir , Bernard ! " Heloise shouted from the front door . Then to Tom , who walked out with her , " Non ! " Tom watched bitterly as the red lights of the Alfa-Romeo turned left at the gates and disappeared . Bernard sat smoking a cigarette . From the kitchen came the faint clatter of the garbage pail 's lid . Tom took his torch from the hall table , and went into the spare loo . He went down to the cellar and looked behind the wine cask where Murchison had been . Very luckily there was no bloodstain there . Tom went back upstairs . " You know , Bernard , you 're welcome here tonight , but tomorrow morning the police arrive to look the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods , too . " They might ask you some questions . It 'll only be annoying to you . Do you want to leave before they arrive  --  at eight ? " " Possibly , possibly . " It was nearly 10 P.M. Mme. Annette came in to ask if they would like more coffee . Tom and Bernard declined . " Mme. Heloise has gone out ? " Mme. Annette asked . " She decided to go and see her parents , " said Tom . " At this hour ! Ah , Mme. Heloise ! " She collected the coffee things . Tom sensed that she disliked Bernard , or mistrusted him , in the same way Heloise did . It was regrettable , Tom thought , that Bernard 's character did not come through , that it had such an off-putting surface for most people . Tom realized that neither Heloise nor Mme. Annette could like him , because they knew nothing about him really , nothing about his devotion to Derwatt ? which they would probably consider " putting Derwatt to use . " Above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite different backgrounds , would ever understand Bernard Tufts ' progress from rather working class origin ( according to Jeff and Ed ) to what might be called the edge of greatness by  | virtue of his talent  --  though he signed his work with another name . Bernard did not even care about the money side of it ? which would again be incomprehensible to Mme. Annette and Heloise . Mme. Annette left the room rather quickly , and in what Tom felt was as much of a huff as she dared . " There 's something I 'd like to tell you , " Bernard said . " The night after Derwatt died ? We all heard about his death twentyfour hours after it happened in Greece . I ? I had a vision of Derwatt standing in my bedroom . There was moonlight coming through the window . I 'd broken a date with Cynthia , I remember , because I wanted to be alone . I could see Derwatt there and feel his presence . He was even smiling . He said , Do n't be alarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm feeling no pain . ' Can you imagine Derwatt saying something as predictable as that ? Yet I heard him . " Bernard had heard his inner ear . Tom listened respectfully . " I sat up in bed watching him for maybe a minute . Derwatt sort of drifted around my room , the room where I paint sometimes  --  and sleep . " Bernard meant painted Tufts , not Derwatts . Bernard continued , " He said , Carry on , Bernard . I 'm not sorry . ' By sorry , I gathered he meant he was n't sorry he 'd killed himself . He meant , just go on living . That is " ? Bernard looked at Tom for the first time since he had begun speaking ? " for as long as it 's supposed to last . It 's hardly something one has control over , is it ? Destiny does it for you . " Tom hesitated . " Derwatt had a sense of humor . Jeff says he might 've appreciated your forging his work with such success . " Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point . Yes , the forging might have been a professional joke . Derwatt would n't have liked the business side of it . Money might have made him commit suicide as easily as being broke . " Tom felt Bernard 's thoughts starting to turn again , in a disorganized and hostile way , hostile to him . Should he make a move to call it a night ? Or would Bernard take that as an insult ? " The blasted flies are arriving so early , I think I 'll turn in. , , Bernard leaned forward . " You did n't understand what I meant
