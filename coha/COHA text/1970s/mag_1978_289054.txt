For the Camp followers , nary a leak to plug <P> While Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin were conferring with Jimmy Carter at Camp David , a vignette that might have been lifted from Evelyn Waugh 's Scoop was being played out six miles away in the town of Thurmont , Md. ( pop . 2,400 ) . Just as a Newsweek reporter sat down to interview ABC White House Correspondent Sam Donaldson about his adventures covering the summit , a Swedish television crew glided up to film the exchange . Within seconds , an Israeli TV unit began filming the Swedes filming the Newsweek reporter interviewing ABC 's Donaldson . Then two Egyptian journalists sidled over and started taking notes on how the Israelis were filming the Swedes filming ... <P> So it went all week .

Presiding over the single daily press briefing , Powell confined himself intentionally to what he called " rather innocent information " and even refused to acknowledge that negotiations were taking place ; he would call them only " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air : " We 're doing our best with the material at hand , Walter , and maybe later the news will be better . " NBC was reduced to opening one news broadcast with extensive closeup footage of a honey bee working over Camp David daisies . <P> There were other distractions in Thurmont besides the absence of news . The press center dispensed cheap booze ( 35 for a beer , 50 for hard stuff ) . Idle journalists could walk the length of Thurmont 's main street in about seven minutes or gawk at ABC 's Barbara Walters and Anchor Frank Reynolds as they tried to negotiate the town 's narrow streets in their matching chauffeur-driven Fleetwood limousines.
