The recent dismissal of several top officers of Gulf Oil was only the latest episode in a series of scandals that has plagued U.S. business over the past 2 years . One of the more interesting side-lights of these scandals , which have eroded the confidence of most Americans in businessmen , is how business is reported-and judged-by the press and television . In the following essay , adapted from a recent speech , Louis Banks , visiting professor at Harvard University Graduate School of Business Administration and former managing editor of FORTUNE , addressed himself to the subject . <P> In baseball , a sports reporter can sense the meaning of an outfielder 's single step to the left or right as a new man comes to bat , and he would be thumbed out of his job in two days if he patently did not know what he was writing about . Ditto the drama critic or the police reporter . Yet general-assignment reporters plunge into issues that mean life or death for management , employees , customers-even a community-without the slightest sense of business perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page or 60 seconds on network television constitutes the daily brush between the run-of-the-mine reporter and the run-of-the-mine businessman , with the latter caught in the glare of the spotlight . Here is where we are fed a daily diet of authoritative ignorance , most of which conveys a cheap-shot hostility to business and businessmen . Here is where the nation sees a persistently distorted image of its most productive and pervasive activity , business . The fact is most general reporters and editors are woefully ignorant of the complexities and ambiguities of corporate operations and thus are easy targets for politicians or pressure-group partisans with special axes to grind at the expense of business . <P> Some of these newsmen are like kids with loaded pistols , prowling through the forests of corporate complexity to play games of cowboys and Indians or good guys and bad guys . Their only interest in business is to find a negative story that will get them promoted out of business into Woodward and Bernstein . And by and large this is what too many of their editors also want . <P> Every businessman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and here are only a few : <P> &gt; At the time of a critical issue of securities , the chief financial officer of AT &T; is challenged on his financial policies by a wire-service reporter who , it turns out , does not know the difference between a stock and a bond . <P> &gt; The chairman of Exxon explains his company 's policy in the Middle East for 45 minutes to network television , only to see it compressed to a meaningless 30 seconds . <P> &gt; A progressive and socially oriented corporation , caught in a long , involved controversy with a small group of employees , has to start all over again on each day 's development with a new reporter who has no knowledge except a clipping of the last story . <P> Students at a Harvard Business School seminar will not soon forget the words of a visiting editor of a metropolitan daily who frankly stated that his happiest moment comes when he has brought a businessman to his knees .               @ @ @ @ @ @
