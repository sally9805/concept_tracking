AI EAST // The crowd of 33,694 that jammed Fenway Park for the first Boston-New York game since the Oct. 2 , 1978 playoff anticipated another classic confrontation between Red Sox Pitcher Mike Torrez and Yankee playoff hero Bucky Dent . Torrez got Dent to bounce out in his first at bat , but that was the last good news of the day for Boston . The Yankees won 10-0 and had 17 hits , including Reggie Jackson 's bases-loaded double and a Dent single that sent Torrez to the showers . Jim Beattie , who early last season had pitched so badly in Fenway that he was dispatched to the minors , got the win  --  and his first big league shutout. // Otherwise it was a joyous week for both clubs . New York ( 4-2 ) got another win  --  11-3 over Detroit ( 3-3 )  --  from Tommy John , at 8-0 the majors ' most successful pitcher . For the week , the Yankees scored 43 runs as Graig Nettles hit three homers and had 15 RBIs. // The Red Sox took four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chuck Rainey continued his surprising pitching , beating Oakland 8-2 on three hits . Dennis Eckersley defeated the Orioles 3-2 in 10 innings for his first win over Baltimore in three years . And there were bigger surprises . Normally considered an offensive team , the Red Sox beat Baltimore behind six outstanding defensive plays and had four double plays in a 4-3 win over New York . The DPs stoked up the already heated Sox-Yankee rivalry . Blasting Jackson and Thurman Munson for sliding beyond the baseline to try to knock him out of two of the double plays , Boston Shortstop Rick Burleson bleeped , " I hate every dirty bleeper who wears a bleeping pinstripe uniform . " // Cleveland ( 5-2 ) was uncustomarily joyous . The pitching staff allowed only 17 runs in seven outings , as Rick Waits got two wins  --  1-0 over Toronto on two hits and , combined with Don Hood and Dan Spillner , 6-0 over Detroit on four  --  and Wayne Garland beat Minnesota 3-2 for his first win since April 25 , 1978 .

Milwaukee ( 1-5 ) was more miserable than it 's been in a long , long time . The Brewers dropped to fourth and lost Outfielder Larry Hisle for at least two weeks with a torn muscle in his shoulder . If he needs surgery , he could be finished for the season . So , Brewer fans fear , would be any hope of a divisional title . // Despite a 3-2 week , there was cause for concern in Baltimore , too . Base-running errors contributed to a 6-2 defeat by Boston , and Pitcher Steve Stone , the loser in that game , allowed a first-or second-inning home run for the fourth time in a row . Toronto had a 2-6 week , which at least was consistent . It kept the Jays ' season percentage at .250 . At their current rate , they 'll equal the pace of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Pitcher Jim Clancy has been lost for six to eight weeks after surgery on his right foot . // BALT 25-13 BOS 24-13 NY 21-17 MIL 21-18 DET 14-18 CLEV 15-22 TOR 10-30 // AL WEST // When surprising Minnesota ( 2-4 ) began its first tough stretch of competition with three losses to Texas , critics scoffed , " I told you so , " and shifted their attention from the first-place Twins to the Rangers ( 4-3 ) . Of special note was Texas ' red-hot Relief Pitcher Jim Kern , who faced the minimum nine batters while shutting the door on the Twins in the 7-5 Rangers victory that opened the series . Kern , 5-0 , picked up saves in the other two wins . But the Twins immediately righted themselves , beating Kansas City 7-6 in what has become their typical fashion . Jerry Koosman got the win , his seventh without a loss ; Mike Marshall got the save , his 10th ; and Shortstop Roy Smalley had a hand in the game-ending double play . Not that Smalley was aware it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second , threw to first and I do n't remember another thing , " said Smalley , who was knocked down on the play by George Brett . The Twins took another game from the Royals , 10-6 in 10 innings , behind the 4-for-6 hitting of Hosken Powell . // Even so , the Royals ( 4-3 ) were beginning to resemble contenders . The most promising sign was a return to form of Pitcher Rich Gale , who had kept them in the race early in 1978 . Gale decided to stop worrying about walks , and he set down the Mariners 1-0 on five hits  --  and four bases on balls . In his first five starts , Gale had concentrated on not walking batters . He gave up only eight bases on balls in 27 innings , but was 0-2 . Last year , when he walked 100 in 192 innings , he was 13-3 before injuring his shoulder in mid-August . Steve Busby , who won his first game since April 9 , 1978 , could smell victory coming . " There 's a certain scent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after beating Seattle 4-3 . " You may go a long time without winning , but you never forget that scent . " Al Hrabosky , by contrast , has been leaving a bad taste in Kansas City 's mouth . In his last five appearances , he has given up eight earned runs and 12 hits in 3 ? innings . // The fourth contender , California , won five of six , with Frank Tanana beating Chicago 7-3 for his first win since April 20 . Up the coast , Seattle ( 3-3 ) was still trying to get unpacked . Only Willie ( The Ancient Mariner ) Horton , Seattle 's 36-year-old designated hitter , seemed at peace with himself . " I do n't worry about hitting streaks , " said Horton , who as usual was streaking ( .348 ) in the spring . " Winning is all that matters .

Before his team snapped an eight-game losing streak by beating Milwaukee 12-4 , Oakland 's run-starved Manager Jim Marshall had visions of transplantation . " I almost wished I was in Wrigley Field , " he said , " watching people run across home plate . " // MINN 24-12 CAL 24-15 TEX 21-16 KC 21-18 CHI 18-19 OAK 13-26 SEA 13-27 // NL EAST // As the Phillies ( 3-3 ) and Cubs ( 1-5 ) collapsed after their 23-22 slugfest ( page 20 ) , a Pirate bat gained renewed stature around the league . It was Willie Stargell 's black beauty , which smote four homers and contributed mightily to Pittsburgh 's best week ( 4-2 ) of the season . Stargell hit his first homer in a 4-3 , 13-inning win over New York , added two more to help beat the Mets 6-5 and hit his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stargell now has hit 60 homers against New York , more than any other player . Shell-shocked in Pittsburgh , the Mets ( 1-4 ) limped home from a 3-11 road trip . After the club 's chief operating officer , Lorinda de Roulet , met with Manager Joe Torre , she told the few New Yorkers who were n't concentrating on the Yankees and hockey 's Rangers , " He did n't think it would be necessary for me to address the club . He said all the players are doing their darndest. " // So were the Cardinals ( 4-0 ) , who had something to show for it . They whipped Atlanta 7-3 on Pete Vuckovich 's six-hitter and George Hendrick 's three RBIs , beat the Expos 1-0 on John Denny 's two-hitter , defeated Montreal again , 2-0 , as Bob Forsch got his first win , and exploded for six runs in the 12th inning to beat New York 9-4 . " If nobody 's believing , they 're crazy , " said Third Baseman Ken Reitz of an early bout of pennant fever that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public relations were also crazy . Outraging 18,225 fans at Busch Memorial Stadium , the Cardinals suspended a 2-2 game in the 10th inning so the players could make a 4:55 p.m. flight to New York for the next day 's game . " Obviously we made a mistake , " said Executive Vice-President John Claiborne. // As St. Louis moved six games ahead of its 1978 pace , Montreal ( 2-3 ) extended its losing streak to five games before beating Philadelphia 5-3 . One of the losses  --  a 1-0 defeat by St. Louis  --  was divisive as well . When the Cards ' Mike Phillips came to bat with men on second and third and two outs in the ninth , Expo Manager Dick Williams gave Steve Rogers the option : pitch to him or walk him to get to a pinch hitter . Rogers pitched and yielded a game-ending single . " That move is the manager 's , not the pitcher 's , " snapped team President John McHale. // PHIL 24-12 MONT 21-13 ST .

" I 'm enjoying helping the team , " said Welch , who helped extend a Los Angeles winning streak to eight games by beating the Braves 5-4 . " Maybe if I stop helping , it wo n't be as much fun . " When the Dodgers lost four straight games , during which Welch pitched only once , he was neither helpful nor , presumably , happy . // The Dodger-beaters were Atlanta ( 3-4 ) and Cincinnati ( 5-1 ) , each of which took two from L.A. " I do n't understand it , " Dodger Pitcher Doug Rau said of the Braves . " They ca n't be this good or they would n't be in last place . As far as we 're concerned , they 're great . " The Braves certainly agreed that Dale Murphy 's hitting was great . He batted .462 , with four homers and 12 RBIs . Meanwhile , the Reds quietly ran their lead up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boorish gesture by the club 's president , Dick Wagner ; he refused to let Cincy writers honor Pete Rose , who was elected the Reds ' MVP last season , in a home-plate ceremony when he visits Riverfront Stadium on June 1 . " I 'm not interested in honoring a player from another club in our park , " said Wagner . So much for Rose 's 16 years in Cincinnati . // So what if Vida Blue 's ERA was 4.99 and John Montefusco was on the disabled list ; other Giant lights were shining . Phil Nastu got his first major league win , beating the Astros 8-1 on five hits ; Ed Halicki threw a 3-0 , two-hit shutout at Houston ; and Willie McCovey ended a 5-2 week with an 11th-inning homer that beat Atlanta 7-6. // Joe Niekro , who twice went the distance for wins , saved the week for Houston ( 2-4 ) . // Despite Gene Richards ' .440 hitting , San Diego ( 3-3 ) also needed some saving .

With attendance about 30,000 ahead of last year 's club-record pace , the Padres obviously have n't been hit by the gas shortage  --  yet .
