Beyond his anger at Israel 's general approach to negotiations , Anwar Sadat is outraged by Premier Menachem Begin 's determination to hold on to 16 Jewish settlements in northern Sinai . Last week TIME 's Robert Slater visited the largest of these settlements , Yamit ( Hebrew for " little sea " ) . His report : <P> Community bulletin-board notices in Yamit range from the mundane to the momentous . One announces natural-childbirth classes ; another appeals to the settler who left a pair of shoes in Sasoon 's delicatessen to retrieve them . But mixed with these is a plea for volunteers to chauffeur townsmen to Jerusalem for a protest demonstration . Another seeks donations to a fund " to keep Yamit Israeli . " <P> Established four years ago in the hot sun and sand of northern Sinai , 77 miles southwest of Tel Aviv , Yamit , like 15 other settlements near by , was built as an Israeli buffer between the Sinai and the Gaza Strip . Before last week 's breakdown in peace talks , Begin had hinted that the territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off debate and diatribes throughout Israel , and the Premier subsequently said that the settlements would remain under Israeli sovereignty even if the Sinai is returned to Egypt . Prior to that promise , the settlers in Yamit were in an angry mood . The town is the one with the greatest expectations for growth . It now has a population of 1,500 , divided almost equally between civilian residents and military families ; the settlers hope that their seaside community will eventually become a regional center of 20,000 . <P> " When Begin proposed giving back the Sinai , it just blew our minds , " says Gary Mazal , 30 , a New Yorker who settled in the desert 27 months ago . Mazal points out that Israeli governments have spent at least $7.5 million so far to build attractive concrete apartments and single-family houses , their grounds surrounded by palm and guava trees , as well as shops , schools and workshops . <P> Further planning , for the moment , seems impossible ; already one investor who was prepared to put up $400,000 to build the settlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yamit were outraged at the reaction when they offered 50 building lots for sale in Israel as a symbolic way to draw attention and secure support for their cause . The lots were sold quickly enough , but to speculators gambling on profits to be made from indemnities if and when the area is returned to Egyptian sovereignty . <P> Yamit 's residents are Israeli and intend to remain so . Their streets are patch-worked with blue-and-white Israeli flags snapping defiantly in the desert wind . Should Begin or another Premier eventually agree to return Sinai to Egypt , the settlers intend to try by court action to hold the government to a 1971 promise to keep the settlements under Israeli control . But most of the residents would leave if the Egyptians returned . Says Carol Rosenblatt , a 36-year-old mother of three from Miami Beach whose thatch-roofed restaurant is a local gathering place : " I brought my kids here to live in Israel . " However , a few are uncertain . Says Belgian-born Dov Segal , 37 , who three months ago opened Yamit 's first supermarket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would mean . But until I hear the full explanation of what it would be like , I wo n't say no. "
