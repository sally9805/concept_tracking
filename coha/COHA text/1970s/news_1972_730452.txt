txt Representatives of three farm organizations and several Democratic members of a House Agriculture subcommiti tee sharply criticized the Department of Agriculture today , for the way it had handled the United States-Soviet grain deal . The criticism was based on allegations that the department did not make available to wheat producers and farmers cooperatives the information , that was available to six large commercial dealers that have sold about 400 million bushels , of wheat to the Soviet Union since President Nixon announced the $750-million deal last July 8 . In particular the Democrats and farm organizations wanted to know why Charles W. Pence , a department official , had called exporters but not producers ' organizations on Aug. 24 about an impending change in policy on export subsidies that was not announced until Aug. 25 . In reply , Mr. Pence and Carroll G. Brunthaver , Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for International Affairs , maintained that this advance notification did not in any way benefit the exporters because they had been told that the new policy had already taken effect the day before , on Aug. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the companies could not have hastily concluded contracts on Aug. 24 before the lose of business to profit by a special subsidy that they did not know about because it was not announced until Aug. 25 . Mr. Pence 's contention that exporters had been told that the new policy had already taken effect on Aug. 23 was contrary to what he told reporters last week . In a day-long hearing of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Livestock and Grains , the critics concentrated their fire on the losses suffered by farmers in the early harvest states of Texas , Oklahoma and Kansas who , unaware of the magnitude of the prospective Soviet deal , sold winter wheat in July at $1.32 a bushel or thereabouts , A few weeks later the Soviet purchases had pushed prices received by farmers up to $1.65 and $1.70 a bushel . Weldnn V. Barton of the National Farmers Union testified that the farmers who sold early stood to lose in two ways . First , he ? said , they lost on the grain that the companies had bought far export . Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ' certificate payments . " These are payments made by the Federal Government to make up the difference between the parity price seL by the Government and the average price paid to farmers over five marketing , months . The losses on certificate payments were estimated by Mr. Barton at about $68.4-million . Representative Graham Purcell , Democrat of Texas , who is the subcommittee chairman , ) has offered a bill to reimburse the farmers who made such early sales for losses resulting from lower certificate payments . Representative W. ? R. Poage , Democrat of Texas , who is chairman of the full committee , asked Mr. Brunthaver , what he had to suggest to recompense the farmers . Mr. Brunthaver conceded that such farmers " were hurt , " as were those bakers who had to pay higher prices for flour as a result of the mounting prices , But he said , " 1 do n't know what the position of the department will be . " The second area of criticism involved a special export subsidy that the department announced on Aug. 25 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ export subsidy on wheat representing the difference between the domestic price at various ports and the world price . The department had been trying to maintain a price for export based on a world price of $1.63-$1.65 a bushel . It had assured exporters that if they sold wheat to the Soviet Union at this price , a subsidy would be paid between that price and the domestic price they would have to pay . However , as the domestic price rose rapidly in August , the department decided it could no longer keep this commitment , and on Aug. 25 it announced that henceforth the subsidy would be paid on the difference between the actual world price and the domestic price . At the same time , the department decided it would be unfair not to give a subsidy based on the $1.63 on all sales before the close of business on Aug. 24 for which the exporters had not yet applied . The special subsidy was set at 47 cents a bushel . This offer was good for five business days ? until Sept. 1 . In that period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent subsidy ? . a total of almost $132-million . At the first hearing of the subcommittee last Thursday , Representative John Melcher , Democrat of Montana , asked Secretary of Agriculture Earl L. Butz and Mr. Brunthaver whether Mr. Pence had called the six principal exporters of wheat to the Soviet Union on Aug. 24 and informed them of the impending change of policy on export payments . At first , they both answered , no , and then amended their answers to " not that I am aware of , " The implication of Mr. Melcher 's question was that , inasmuch as the companies , had been informed several hours be ? fore the close of busihess on Aug. 24 , they could have arranged for sales that would have been eligible for the special subsidy . The next day the department put out a statement saying that Mr. Pence had called the companies but had told them that the change of policy would be effective as of close of business on Aug. 23 , and that therefore the information would not be of any advantage to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 , the department 's statement said , was , taken on Aug. 25 , " since some exporters conceivably might not have received word on Thurgday , Aug. 24 , and therefore might have continued selling wheat under the earlier payment policy . " Today , Mr. Brunthaver and Mr. Pence repeated this explanation , Mr. Brunthaver said that he had told Frank , assistant general sales manager of the Export Marketing Service , to inform the traders , an0 that he had not known when he answered Mr. Melcher 's question last Thursday that Mr. had asked Mr. Pence to make the calls . Mr. Brunthaver insisted that the exporters had not been in. formed by Mr. Pence what the special subsidy would be , or even that there would be a two-tiered system for five days . They were told , he said , only that they could not count on the previous export price policy being continued . Mr. Brunthaver said this notification was not considered " market sensitive , " that is , that no advantage could be gained by it . This explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas 5 . Foley , Democrat of Wash inebn , For example , Mr. Foley wanted to know why , if the information was not " market sensitive , " the department had not also informed producers and milers of the impending policy change . Mr. Brunthaver replied there had been concern that , if a public announcement had been made of the impending policy change , it would have been received by farmers as an indication of a " bearish " intention in the department , that is , an intention to drive prices down and by reducing the subsidy . The result , Mr. Brunthaver said , might have been that farmers would have sold wheat at about 29 cents below the then market price . This did not satisfy Mr. Foley , who said he had difficulty understanding why the prior notification to the exporters was not " market sensitive , " but was market sensitive to farmers . Mr. Melcher asked Mr. Pence whether , in interviews with reporters of The New York Times and The Washington Post last week , he had said that he ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been effected on Aug. 23 . He said he had . As a matter of fact , the two reporters were not told this .
