Goons threw acid on the owner of a truck stop outside Detroit for displaying the magazine . A stopover in eastern Ohio was blown up for featuring it on a newsrack . Gunmen shot out the gas signs of a stop in Indiana and threatened worse if the display rack did not go . When it comes to circulation , Overdrive magazine has had some unique problems . They are the price that the muckraking journal , which calls itself the voice of America 's independent truckers , has had to pay for documenting corruption in the trucking industry . In the past three years alone , the 14-year-old monthly has printed more than 20 carefully researched articles linking criminal figures to abuses in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters ' pension fund . Last month , when James Hoffa disappeared , reporters automatically turned to Overdrive for an explanation . In its latest issue , out this week , Overdrive concludes that the Mob did Hoffa in . <P> Diverted Funds . In a racket-infested , violent industry , maverick Overdrive ( circ. 56,000 ) speaks with high-tonnage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drinkhall , 35 , the magazine 's top investigative reporter , who specializes in the Teamsters ' infamous and huge Central States $1.5 to $2 billion pension fund . Drinkhall roused a federal investigation in 1973 with articles showing that a $1.4 million Teamsters pension-fund loan , ostensibly given to a plastics company in New Mexico , was really used primarily to finance the Chicago syndicate 's purchase of wiretapping equipment . He also revealed that the Tonight Show 's Ed McMahon and an associate misused some of a $1.5 million Teamster advance paid them to run a public relations campaign . In addition , Drinkhall has uncovered schemes to divert union funds into resorts like La Costa near San Diego and various Las Vegas hotels . Says the mustachioed reporter : " I have never investigated a pension-fund loan and found a straight business transaction . " <P> What gives Drinkhall-and Overdrive-their franchise to hunt is the populist philosophy of the magazine 's editor-publisher and sole owner , Michael Parkhurst . New Jersey-born Parkhurst , 41 , became an owner-operator trucker at 17 but sold his rig after ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a major trucking center . He wanted " to wake the truckers up to the fact that they 're slaves to a monopoly . " Parkhurst would visit truck stops by horse for publicity , but service , not stunts , made Overdrive . It dug , exposed , and above all helped out . There have been graphic headlines ( HOW YOUR SWEAT FINANCES CROOKS ' CADILLACS ) and explosive stories , but truckers have also been attracted by the offer of free collect calls for legal advice , tips on taxes-and cheesecake . The independents also came to respect Parkhurst for his crusades to get clean truck stops and uniform trailer lengths , and for his no-nonsense technical reports on new trucks . <P> Today , Overdrive is fat ( normally 150 pages ) and prosperous . In 1973 the magazine grossed more than $1 million , but Parkhurst drew barely $14,000 in salary and the journal 's net was only $1,750 . The reasons : Parkhurst pays good salaries to his staff of 21 and pours money into the Independent Truckers Association , legislative lobbying and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
