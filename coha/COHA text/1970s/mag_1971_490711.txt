THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment TER a period of uncertainty , A the American-South Vietnam- ese campaign in Laos once again makes it clear that the United States is trying to win the war in Indo-China . When one uses the word " win " in connection with this war , it is necessary to specify exactly what one means . Our objective in going into Vietnam was to help a government fight its enemies until it could stand on its own . Attaining this objective , and nothing more than this objective , is what it would mean for the United States to " win " in Inds-China . It is this objective that has eluded us for a decade , and it is this objective that President Nixon seems to be still pursuing ht extending the war into Laos . This , apparently , is what he is talking about when he uses the code words " peace with honor . " " Honor " here means winning . The real difference between a dove and a hawk is not that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to continue ; it is that a dove wants us to get out of Indo-China whether the Saigon government collapses or not , and a hawk does n't want us to leave until the Saigon government is strong enough to stand on its loam . In saying that the President remains a hawk , no one is suggesting that he loves war and hates peace , or that he wants our troops to stay in Indo-China just because he likes having them there . One is saving that , whatever he may want , he will end up keeping our armed forces in Indo-China , because lie is unwilling to give up trying to achieve the objectives this country has failed for ten years to achieve . This is not something that the Administration always readily admits to . It claims that the campaigns in Cambodia and Laos are designed to protect our forces as we evacuate them , but this is almost self-evidently not the case . Our troops could leave speedily and safely without first attacking all the neighboring countries . The real purpose of these new military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not because we are leaving but in order that we may leave , and this is precisely the policy that the United States pursued under two Presidents before President Nixon . Does this mean , then , that after several years in which it seemed plausible that the United States had changed its polio we have returned to the situation in 1967 , when President Johnson was still convinced that the war could he won by military , measures ? Unfortunately , it appears that we are actually in a more discouraging position than we were then . What we sec around us is a breakdown  --  or , rather , the evidence of a cumulative breakdown . It is a breakdown of Constitutional restrictions , public debate , and political action , and also a breakdown of will , judgment , and moral scruple . In short , it represents an extreme  --  although not , one trusts , final  --  collapse of the delicate constraints that a free people exercises over its war machine and its leaders . In Congress , in the press , and all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paralysis , among the people from whom one might expect leadership in the current crisis . In 1967 , with each escalation of the war one could expect a stiffening of the opposition . Each new move called forth a fresh re sponse . In 1967 , also , one could expect that as politicians and the public learned more about the dangers of the war , and as the stories of crimes committed by Americans in Indo-China m1116/flied , the public 's revulsion against the war would deepen , and would perhaps serve , in the end , to get us out . It seemed then that there were certain obstacles to new escalations  --  certain principles in the Constitution , certain limits to the abuse that the Congress was willing to take , and certain simple standards of decency that ' mist Americans shared . But now it seems that all these obstacles have been faced and crushed . Two new borders have been crossed , the bombing of North Vietnam has been intermittently resumed , and the entire nation knows that , except for nuclear war and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not committed in Indo-China . Our B-52s are ranging freely across the newly violated borders . When the B-52 strikes , it leaves a path of craters a mile long . In the month before the Laos campaign , there were roughly six thousand B-52 strikes throughout Indo-China . Yet , knowing all this , and having been mot eel to widespread protest on several occasions , the nation has now grown silent . Having looked at what we have done to Vietnam , we are doing it again in Cambodia and in Laos . Now that we have accepted all thus , and have continued with the war , what is left that can stir us into finally leaving Indo-China ? Is there any limit to what we will accept ? Certainly it has been one of the particular triumphs of this Administration that , along with continuing to expand the destruction of Indo-China , it has destroyed the debate over Indo-China in the United States . The Administration 's degree of success in this can he judged from the fact that few men in Congress or elsewhere challenged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " widening of the war . " But if it was not a widening of the war , then what would be a widening of the war ? As for the press , it seemed so preoccupied with the " news embargo " that it presented the actual move into Laos almost as a footnote Everywhere , except in Vietnam itself , where energetic preparations for the new move were under way , Americans seemed dispirited and tired . It is as though expansion of the war had been accepted as a natural law , like gravity , which no one can control and only madmen would even consider opposing . But in reality to what extent has this war ever been under anyone 's control ? To what extent - has it been obedient to any American 's will or judgment ? Have our Presidents been in control of the war ? What has this war been if not the story of the breakdown of the government 's control over its own actions ? Does the record show that it ever enjoyed the power to do anything but bring senseless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Presidents and their advisers and our generals and all our other " leaders " who have " run " this war have been trapped in isolation and in ignorance of the war , their judgment destroyed by the flood of spurious " information " given them by overflnanced armed bureaucracies that had gone wild in a part of the world no bureaucracy understood ? Now it appears that , in our weariness , the rest of us are in danger of succumbing to the hypnotic effect of the self-propagandizing machine that has put our leaders to sleep , one by one . Perhaps there are a few people in the White House or in the Pentagon who regard the opening of this new campaign , and the silence that has greeted it throughout the country , as a triumph for their point of view . What has happened , however , is not that the Administration has won something and its opponents have lost something . What has happened is that a war that no one  --  not even the most belligerent hawks  --  ever wanted , or even imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not really a victory of one point of view over another ; it is a victory of momentum over all points of view , a victory of violence over restraint , a victory of fatigue ! over vigilance and control . The events of the last two weeks represent the subjugation of men by imper serial forces and the transformation of human organizations into blind machines , which have got nut of control . It is something like a death of the spirit . This is no person 's hour of triumph . This is the hour of the B-52 . The 8-52 casts its shadow over Indo-China , and over America , too . It has thrown off its harness , its victims have no place to hide , and its keepers are asleep . ?

TT is one-forty-five on a cold , winter-gray Friday afternoon . There are about a dozen people inside the Ap-thorp Self-Service Laundromat , between Seventy-seventh and Seventy-eighth Streets on the west side of Broadway .

On the laundromat 's drab painted walls arc a clock and a few signs : " No Timex Allowed , " " Last Wash : 10 P.m. , " " Not Responsible for Personal Property , " " Pack As Full As You Want . " On the drab linoleum floor arc two trash cans ( filled to the brim ) , a wooden bench , three shabby chairs ( occupied ) , and a table , on which a pretty young black girl is folding clothes , and at which a dour , heavyset black woman in her sixties is eating lunch out of a grease-stained brown paper hag . The heavy set woman has brought no clothes with her to the laundromat . The regular patrons believe she has nowhere else to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On a previous visit , she had tossed a chicken bone at someone , wordlessly , and the gesture had been accepted , too , as a reasonable protest against the miserableness of her life . Half the people in the laundromat have two washing machines going at once . The machines keep them busy inserting coins , stuffing in clothes , and adding detergents , bleaches , and fabric softeners at various stages of the cycle ( twenty-five minutes ) . The newly washed clothes are retrieved from the washing machines and transferred , in a swooping motion , across the narrow corridor to the dryers . No one darer leave the laundromat to attend to other errands while his clothes are drying at the rate of ten cents for ten minute s , with most things requiring twenty or thirty minutes ) , because it is known that clothes that have been left to their own devices in the dryers have disappeared in a matter of Eve minutes .

In one washing machine , a few striped sheets and pillowcases are spinning , creating a dizzying optical effect . In another , a lively clothes dance is taking place  --  three or four white shirts jitterbugging with six or eight pairs of gray socks . In a third , the clothes , temporarily obscured by a flurry of soapsuds , still cast a spell over their owner , who does n't take her eyes off the round glass window in the front of the machine . The clothes in the dryers  --  here a few towels , there some men 's work pants-seem to he free-falling , like sky divers drifting down to earth . The laundromat smells of a sweet mixture of soap and heat , and is noisy with the hum and whir of the machines .

" Here you 're supposed to be able to regulate the temperature of the water , but sometimes I punch the warm button and the water comes out ice-cold , " she says . " Oh , well , vou sort of have to expect things like that . The owner is very nice . He does the best he can . " A middle-aged man wearing a trenchcoat takes a load of children 's clothes out of a large washing machine , folds them neatly , and runs out of the laundromat with the damp pile of girls ' school dresses and boys ' polo shirts and blucjeans over one arm .

Is the nightgown 's owner at work , putting him through school , or has she become a Liberated Woman and declined to go to the laundromat ? ) Two little children run down the narrow center aisle playing tag , chanting in Spanish , tripping over laundry carts , and meeting with scowls from the grownups . A washing machine goes on the blink . Someone goes next door to the service Laundromat to summon the proprietor , who comes over immediately , climbs on top of the broken machine , reaches behind it , and restores it to working order in no time . He apologizes , in a Polish accent , to one of his regular customers for the scruffiness of the three chairs on the premises . " Six months ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . " Fifty-dollar chairs . The next day , they were gone . " People come and go , but the population inside the laundromat remains constant at about a dozen . The majority of the customers are blacks and Puerto Ricans who live in nearby tenements and welfare hotels . Most of the whites in the neighborhood live in apartment houses , and have washing machines . tnd dryers in their apartments or in the basements of their buildings , or send their clothes out to local Chinese laundries . One white woman , a blonde in her fifties , says , t ? no one in particular , that she comes to the laundrornat because the laundry room in the basement of her apartment building is not safe . " There have been incidents there , " she say s meaningfully . " I would love to have my own washing machine , but the landlord says he has to pay for the water , so he wo n't allow it .

The Bee Gees have had a number of hit records , and at the moment one of them , " Lonely Days , " is No. 1 on some charts . " They 're all three brothers , " a well-dressed black girl said , " and two of them are twins , but I can never tell which two .

" They 're Australian , not Canadian , " said one girl . " I saw someone with furry feet , and I thought lie might he a Bee Gee , but he was n't , " said another . Finally , the Bee Gees arrived . We talked to Barry Gibb , a Bee Gee ( " I 'm the third one on the left that is , looking from behind " ) , and asked him how it felt to have a No. 1 hit . " I 'm a nervous wreck , " he said .

There were simple styles and complex styles . Leonard Harris , arts editor at C.B.S. , who was wearing a blue blazer , and tortoiseshell glasses held together with adhesive tape , had a very simple style . All he wanted was a real rehearsal to film , and lie had a number of straightforward , simple conversations with Sir John Gielgud , who will direct " All Over , " and who thought the idea of a televised first reading was appalling . Mr. Harris was able to shade his pronunciation of " Sir John " to convey many different moods  --  tolerance , impatience , petulance , tolerance again , and , in the end , resignation . Finally , he collapsed on a chair . " Would you believe I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an associate . Mr. Albee had a complex style . He had a very complex glowering smile . The smile indicated that he was happy , but the glowering undercut that impression and indicated that actually he was miserable and enraged and wounded , and not pleased to have so many people in his apartment . All this nevertheless seemed appropriate and becoming , so at a still deeper level he seemed happy . We talked with Sir John Giclgud , whose style was either simple-complex or complex-simple . He sat in a small chair at one side of the fireplace in Mr. Albee 's drawing room . Behind him , at an angle , was a model of the set for " All Over . " On the wall above the fireplace were a Picasso picture and a carved surround in the manner of Grinling Gibbons . The wall itself ( and every other wall in the apartment ) was covered with cork . Both the Picasso and the approximate Grinling Gibbons surround were tacked onto the cork . " We talked about my directing ' All Over ' soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John said .
