" Everything was black and dazzling : if All should lose , all the colors would fade and Atlanta would be still except for a wailing sound of Cadillacs changing into pumpkir IT WAS A KLANSMAN 'S NIGHTMARE , a recrudescence of the worst excesses of the South 's post-bellum years . ' needing down Peachtree Street , spiritual and legendary Southern thoroughfare , were Muhammad Ali and his laughing entourage . They moved with loose , ambling confidence along this main street of Atlanta , as though each step were a gentle appropriation of a moment in history , a casual reclamation of a cultural manner that had been kept , except for moments of entertainment , in the corners of our society for a hundred years . This was no peace march , no righteous group of protestors heading for annihilation , no grim file of militants seeking conflict for the sake of Marx or Mao . Rather , it was sheer , black , street-corner ebullience out for a Sunday evening promenade , an ebullience too happy with itself to affect any solemn disguises or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of social seriousness that has made America such a glum piece of melodrama in the past years . Past the movie houses , restaurants , and hotels of Peachtree Street , past the native pedestrians who surrendered the sidewalk with nervous smiles , went a natural way of life with a deserved , arrogant attitude about itself . Deserved because the fashions , expressions , color , and movements of this life have been the occasions for so much indiscriminate resentment , for the embarrassment of so many Negroes who wanted to leave the idioms of the street behind them as they moved on into a simulation of white culture , and for long treatises that turned the peculiar styles of American Blackness into tedious aspects of cultural anthropology . To have survived all this , to be on high display in the very center of gone-with-the-wind country , is a just cause for a little waggish arrogance , and when Ali stops for a moment as he passes three large , T-shirted , white Atlantans and laughingly challenges the largest of them , a thick 250-pounder with a face that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars , to a little tune-up fight before he faces Jerry Quarry , the glee at the deferential refusal bubbles all over downtown Atlanta . But there is a certain largess in the laughter also , a bestowal , for a small time at least , of a camaraderie that comes from being close to the Heavyweight Champion , of partaking just a little of the grace of such self-confident excellence , The three white men feel these emanations too and , mesmerized , join the march . On the night before Ali 's return to the ring , it seems that everyone touched by his parade must laugh with and admire him . Muhammad All a.k.a . Cassius Clay We had all come from the showing of a movie that had chronicled Ali 's life from his days as a boy in Kentucky to his exile from boxing . It was a film that very clearly took Ali 's side in his battles with official notions of good citizenship . There were pictures of him with Malcolm X , at Muslim rallies , lecturing white audiences on their bad racist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reminded us of how blackness had suddenly thrust a new image of itself into our consciousness and shaded all sorts of bright visions about our society . Sitting in the theater , which was showing as its regular feature an X-rated Nordic study of an d trois affaire , all of the antics and anger of the Sixties were served up again in the person of this babbling boy who , as Eldridge Cleaver remarked in his book Said on Ice , was going through the transition from a Supermasculine Menial to a black man with the nerve to articulate a thought or two . Which is to say that Ali was not accepting the role of a beautifully proportioned physical example of democracy , but was rather challenging that democracy with sprightly fundamentalist objections . And so there he was on screen , talking about slave names , about how " black " is nearly always used as a per-j orative adjective while " white " seems so often to enjoy angelic connotations , and how the Vietcong ? " Little people who do n't have enough to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the American whites in the audience , who were used to much more excoriating rhetoric on this subject , Ali 's effusions seemed almost quaint . A few English reporters were shocked and angered by his unqualified lark of enthusiasm for the white world , but most of us with pale pigment let the hyperbole roll past as if it were only formal , diplomatic jargon . Perhaps after all we have been made numb to such statements now that so many blacks have appropriated the language of general indictment ; perhaps we grant the injustice and , therefore , grant its excessive consequences ; perhaps we are ' bored ; perhaps we no longer connect language with any specific phenomena , and allow epithets and denunciations to hover in the air like other particles of modern pollution that we have learned to accept . All of these might be part of the reason why the snatches of Muslim diatribes and the unctuous , ten dentious narrative of the film seemed to produce so little discomfort in the white viewers . But main13 it is Muhammad Ali who softens his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the put-on about his verbal performance , something that betrays not necessarily a disbelief in what he is saying , but at least a certain amused wonder that so many people appear to take it so seriously . Since the time he was making up jingles that pre-dieted to the round the fate of his opponents , there has always been about his manner a slight suggeslion that madness lay not in his announcing that he would demolish a Sonny Liston or in his embracing a version of the Islamic faith that preached a demonological interpretation of history , but rather in the outrage and analyses that followed them . Coming into the theater that night in Atlanta , he had looked at all those members of the press who were standing about with notebooks in hand and had wondered aloud that people had traveled from Europe , South America . Africa , and Asia to , as he put it , " watch a couple of men jump around in the ring . " There was a dose of false modesty in this , of course ? one has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Ali until the outcome of his legal problems is determined ? but there has been something out of proportion in the exchanges Ali has had with the media of our country . Long before he actually refused induction into the Army and thereby gave the officials of boxing the opportunity to bar him , in the name of patriotism , from the ring and to send their sport back into the sleazy tedium from which he had for a time redeemed it ? long before this concrete act , there had been howls of rage over his behavior , over his rodomontade. over his Muslim pieties , over , finally . the glory he seemed to 111141 in himself . For a time , this imbalance appeared little more than a mismatch of senses of humor : Ali would bluster and wink , the media would earnestly pontificate . But then , when it became clear that he was serious about changing his name , that he was not going to grow up and be ? come another Floyd Patterson or Joe Louis , that he was going to fumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a black man in the United States of America , a much deeper misalliance of styles was created . Sndden-Iy . Ali became a personification of the Negro metamorphosis in the Sixties . Where before he had been a winsome outlaw , the type that enlivens Westerns with a juvenile wildness that is not really had but which finally must firmly he dealt with by the sober , civilizing sheriff , now he was something definitely black and evil . No matter that he was expressing , much more pacifically , by the way , than most black spokesmen , the same disenchantment that millions of blacks and whites felt about the condition of things in America ; no matter that in a rational society all these ideological thrashings about by a young man should be more humanely assimilated ; no matter that to any but the dullest judge of character Ali was more a collection of effusive moods than a hard cohesion of racial anger . In the end , he was America 's Heavyweight Champion , and there has always been anational ritual conjoined with that title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legends , of poverty-to-riches myths , of valuable moral lessons learned along the democratic road to the championship . At the very least , after acquiring such an honor , one should enjoy its benefits in a way compatible with the American dreams of success : even some stylish dissipation a fa Sugar Ray would have been preferable to Ali 's prim moral pose and his trips to emerging African republics . But Ali went his own way and appeared not to know how seriously his office was taken by America . Of course , he discovered this eventually , and he paid for his antics and irony with a suspension both from boxing and from the Muslims . In the last year he became simply another bewildered young celebrity sitting on interview shows , sometimes offering to give up his champion 's belt to the winner of the Frazier-Ellis fight , sometimes threatening a return to the ring , sometimes dropping into a sad incoherence as a Buckley , or a Frost , or a Susskind tried to corner him into an acceptance of the good intentions of at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt that Ali was a clown or a fanatic or a champion , one could not find the situation anything but frantic and despicable . OWEVER , EVEN THOUGH NOTHING of deep mean-1 ling had been resolved concerning Ali and our society , on the night before his return to the ring in Atlanta all the old expressions of anger had lost their sting . There was too much real excitement on hand to waste energy deciphering Ali 's political pronouncements . Tomorrow there would he a clear confrontation of skills that , in the manner of courtly trials by combat , would produce for those of us looking for simple aolutions at least the appearance of a final judgment . For the time being , it was enough , with Ali in the audience loudly admiring his image on the screen . to watch the bouts that had surprised all those experts in the fight world who had first looked at Ali and seen only a flashy ineptitude . One remembered reading the depreciating professional appraisals before his first meeting with Liston , those tough , ring-wise estimates that pronounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fist reach any fragile part of him , that joked about the way he would lean away from a punch and thereby expose his stomach to assault and incapacitate himself as a counter-puncher , that tittered over the young heavyweight 's hubris in holding his hands so low that he must rely solely on his speed for defense . One remembered this , and then watched again as Sonny Liston scowled ferociously and went on to miss punch after punch while being snake-licked by Ali 's left hand until he sat exhausted in his corner unable to make the bell . It became apparent once more that what had happened that night in Miami was the appearance of a new level of grace in heavyweight boxing against which all the old philosophies would be harshly tested . Now one of the most barren enterprises among boxing fans is the past-and-present debate , the argument over whether a young champion in this era of the eight-second rule , the retreat to a neutral corner after a knockdown , and the fifteen-round championship fight could possibly hold his own with the likes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 120-degree Las Vegas sun after training exclusively on whores and whiskey for a month . Well , except in the fantasies of those who love to nourish computers , Ali will never be in the ring with Tunney , Louis , or Dempsey , but it is hard to imagine , after having seen their fights on film , how , with the possible exception of Louis on the best night of his career , Ali could have been touched by them . Those old-time heavyweights just seem to be formed of baser material than Ali , to be more terrene and mixed with impurities . Gravity and fatigue drew them into an awkwardness that betokened pain and the eventual defeat common to all mortals . Ali , however , in fight after fight , moves through the memory like a malicious Arid , insubstantial except for those cutting blows he delivered to all the poor Calibans put by hopeful promoters into the ring with him . Even Ali 's body is an aesthetic affront to the traditions of the fight world . It is nothing like Apollonius ' statue that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gritty torso and face of an aging fighter . There is no mashed nose or split eyebrows , no blistered ears , and the body itself seems to belong to a well-conditioned sensualist rather than to someone who accepts and deals in primitive forms of punishment . It is the body that a cinquecentist might have sketched at languid repose in an Attic landscape , a young Narcissus perhaps . but never a warrior . It is the physical form that only a Walter Pater should bet on in a match against the thick fierceness of a Jerry Quarry . But perhaps the fight world has now learned to believe in delicate proportion , for Ali , on the night before his return to the ring after an absence of over three years , is , according to Jimmy the Creek , a 3-to-1 favorite . The entourage T HE REGENCY HYATT HOUSE is a hotel that in- tends to make its guests feel that they are in a great launching pad with their rooms somewhere in outer space . One looks up several hundred feet to a glass-domed roof . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each floor , railings from which a half-dozen or so visitors have already , in the Regency 's short history , jumped to well-attended suicides , Exposed elevators , looking like transparent suppositories , zip up and down while drab-looking peacocks move in sullen display inside their cages . Suspended about 10 feet above the lobby is a circular bar much frequented by Ali 's supporters who have come from all points of America to the South 's most liberated city . The bartender , however , is not all that liberated . He is close to a state of shock over the alien people who have him scurrying for everything from frozen daiquiris to tumblers of Scotch-and-milk . " Where did they come from , the moon . " he said to me sotto voce after a furtive check to make sure that we formed a little hermetic , white island at the bar 's corner . " I mean we 've had plenty of blacks staying here before , hut , you know , they wore normal suits , walked quiet , had one drink and was gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or something like that , And you know . you hardly noticed therm But these ? it 's like a lot of bombs going off . " Well , I guess there had not been too many men seen in Atlanta wearing mink jump suits , or too many Cadillac Caballeros on the streets with alligator-skin roofs and At Deco designs along the body . I suppose , too , that a young man in a blond wig and a velvet Elizabethan doublet is not an everyday occurrence , as is not a pair of cocoa-hued . Afro-coiffed twins on the arm of a proud Detroit pimp in a pearl-white Borsalino hat , morning dress , and spats . Of course , there were the celebrities ? Poitier , Diana Ross , Bill Cosby. et al , and there were also political leaders like Jesse Jackson and Whitney Young , ; but the fight weekend really belonged to the blacks who are never seen discussing themselves on television or looking grimly at a photographer from the window of an occupied building . For the most part . these were blacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some , like the little dude in a puce suit who announced that he had washed dishes for eight months so that he could invest in a suitable wardrobe , curie to Atlanta , and bet a thousand dollars on his man , putting it all on the line for a day or two of splendor . There was not a beret , field jacket , or African robe in sight . There were even , here and there , examples of elaborately processed hair , great , softly-waved konks that spiraled heavenwards along with the hotel 's elevators . These were Ali 's fans , and they were fanatic . Not for religious reasons , certainly ? one look at most of this gathering and you realized that Muslim austerities would wither them to nothing in a week ; and not even for the sake of racial politics , although they were certainly hoping that the white boy would have his head torn off . Rather . they celebrated Ali because he was of their style ? not sartorially but spiritually . " Owee , he 's bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ali walked among them , and one feels that this simply means that . like them , he has been sassy with life and has not let it turn him into something fat and meek , something without a little snap to its walk , something that ca n't display how good it feels to have an edge on the Man and his world . if une wants an easy visual aid as to the nature of this style and why Ali suits it so well , there is the Ali shuffle , that quick flurry of syncopated half-steps he goes into every now and then during a fight . When I saw it the first time , I immediately thought of the little flourish of footwork that I had seen blacks use to break up the monotony of a 2/4 cadence march when I was in the Army . It would come generally on a left-flank command . The drill instructor would bawl " Leeehft flank ? Hauh ! " as the left foot of the marcher hit the ground . He was then expected to pivot to the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle from the direction he had been going in . The black soldiers , however , when the spirit moved them , would hesitate a half beat before putting that right foot down and then , while it still hovered in the air , they would engage in a little hop and , finally , when the suspended foot touched the ground , would push off quickly on the toe and be back on beat . It was a little rhythmic variation that drove Regular Army NCOs into a a rage and nearly always brought fatigue duty on the heads of the practitioners if they were caught . However , once one tried this bit of improvisation , it was almost impossible to abstain from it , for it was a refreshing insertion of self into all that impersonal military procedure , a moment of idiosyncratic hauteur that made one feel those dry , dusty drill fields of Camp Chaffee could be survived . The All shuffle , which for a weekend would be demonstrated by a different disciple every ten minutes or so in the Regency 's lobby , breaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that unauthorized left-flank maneuver added spice to a regimented march . It may also have a pragmatic purpose in that it disconcerts an opponent , but its main asset is that it demonstrates an Ran , an egotistical strength that will not be worn away by the punches and exertions of a professional fight . And that is the style around which the mink suits and Borsalinos can rally , for it has always been their answer to the social prescriptions bawled out at them , their way of keeping an ego together . When Ali 's fans spilled out onto the streets of Atlanta , one knew that there was a new tempo in town that was much more devastating to Old South rhythms than the gospel cadence of a freedom march . The scales N THE MORNING OF THE DAY a professional fight V is to take place , a little ritual occurs . Both fighters , in the presence of officials and the press . are placed upon a scale and carefully weighed . In the case of a bout between fighters who are less than heavyweights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be certain that both contestants conform to the weight prescribed for their division . For heavyweights , however , who have the right to our species ' most extreme physical statistics , the weigh-in seems designed mainly to give those connected with the fight a subject to occupy themselves with until the evening . As soon as the weights are announced , a buzz begins , and for the next eight hours or so , involved . Byzantine arguments and analyses take place as to what an extra pound or an added inch of calf portends . Quarry is first on the scale , and it is hard to believe that the heavy , sloping shoulders , thickchest , chunky legs , and large , prognathic jaw produce a whole of only 197 pounds . He is , indisputably , a tough-looking man . If one had wished to arrange the ingredients of Ali 's return to the ring according to a recipe of racial melodrama , Quarry was the perfect choice . An Irishman from California , he has a pale , hard , sullen , lower-class face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would seem most apposite peeping out from behind a police visor or supporting a flag-decaled construction hat . As hard as one tries not to judge a man by those tenets of medieval theology that suppose a person 's soul to be revealed by the attributes of the body , it is difficult not to believe that Quarry 's essence is as rough as his exterior . Even the presence of his wife and mother , who weep while he stands astride the scale , does n't seem to humanize him , and as unfair as it is , he remains in the mind as something sullen and angry , as the perfect White Hope as conjured forth by a black imagination . Ali , to everyone 's surprise , is quiet and subdued as he steps onto the scale . When his weight is announced at 2131/2 , there are little murmurs of jubilation in the crowd , for it means that he has trimmed himself down by some 25 pounds in the last six weeks since he began training , and the fans and experts take this as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands of the evening . Just to reassure themselves , however , his supporters move around the room and engage each other in morale-boosting estimates . " Trimmest two-thirteen I ever seen ! " " He look better now than when he fought Foley . " " You did n't see no fat around the gut , did you ? " " Fat ? What you talking about , man ? He 's honed fine , I tell you . " " Yeah , he 's got himself right to a good edge . " But he was so quiet up there . " " He ai n't here to run his mouth , man . He gon na make his sounds tonight . " " Now , I believe that , I surely believe that . " With his arm around his mother , Ali now moves through the crowd chatting amiably and signing autographs . There is a peculiar , untypical stillness about him now , almost an air of bafflement as his supporters push forward to declare their fealty . It is as if he were taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which he is responsible . " IF I lose tonight , " he says gravely , " it 'll be because all my brothers wore me out . " There are groans of protest that he should even consider such a possibility , but this changes to laughter when Ali finally punctuates this utterance with a grin . However , our dude in the puce suit needs a little more reassurance than that . As All is about to step into a waiting car , he pushes forward to the edge of the throng . " Ali , baby , " he cries , " tell me I should bet on you . " Ali points his finger directly at him . " Bet your house and lot , " he admonishes . " My man , " says the puce suit , and then pirouettes with joy . The fight A TLANTA 'S MUNICIPAL AUDITORIUM looks as though it were constructed to hold a good-sized PTA meeting . In its better days Caruso once sang within its walls . but now all it has left is a certain run-down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October 26 , it is transformed . The lobby is awash with color as exquisite entrances are made and the throng mills about , eyeing itself with admiration . No one thinks of going into the arena to watch the preliminaries : all processions to the seats must be timed as closely as possible to coincide with the actual moment of the fight so that a maximum audience will be on hand . The energy in the little arena makes it impossible for anyone to remain still . Back and forth move coiffures that would have dwarfed the wigs at Versailles ; suits and jewels on promenade ; great , hand-slapping greetings made , but in slow motion , so as not to ruin the line of a close-fitting suit . It is a downtown hal masque . a piece of pageantry that ably fills up the stage before the scene 's real action is to begin . Everything is black and dazzling , and one imagines that , if Ali should lose , all the colors would fade away and the city of Atlanta would be still except for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is time . As Ali and Quarry , dodging spectators ' knees and feet , jog down a narrow aisle toward the ring , the audience becomes for a moment subdued . It is as if it senses that all the complex passions it has been enjoying will soon be simply resolved . that whether it is a question of a case-money bet , racial pride , anger , or simply the way one walks hack to the hotel , in less than an hour 's time there will be a resolution . With such a swell of feeling to sustain it , the fight should have been a more exciting encounter . However , in three rounds it was over , Quarry 's left eye gushing blood after having been split open by a series of sharp , snapping punches . One great coital ry came from the audience as the blood trickled along Quarry 's beaded jaw . and then it settled hack into an exhausted , dreamy jubilation as the fight was stopped and Ali proclaimed the victor . To those interested only in the science of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-year Aile had not irrevocably ruined him , had not even , or that matter , diminished his formidable speed ? It least for the duration of three rounds . The fast are that Ali had used throughout the first round when he seemed to spring from his corner into a ustained , three-minute barrage of punches ? could le have kept up such momentum if Quarry 's eye lad not exploded ? Did n't it seem Ali missed more ' unches than he ever did before ? Was n't he caught n the ropes more than he should have been ? Opinms were already being whipped into shape for aloon debate before the fighters left the ring . But the entourage was in no mood to quibble . That they had come to see , they had seen . They ) itered about the auditorium in happy shock , foreven the most devout worshiper had not expected the sign of their righteousness to be produced so easily . Some had hardly had time to arrange themselves in their seats so that their raiment would not he wrinkled before the fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine minutes had been enough ; the questions of pugilistic science were beside the point . Only a fool , after all , questions the details of a miracle that earns him threeto-one on a dollar and the right to believe that there is something quite glorious in his life . Epilogue T HE NEXT DAY , SEVERAL NEW YORKERS were on their way home via Delta Air Lines . They were in a general state of dilapidation : their eyes puffed , their hands unsteady as they indifferently prodded bits of the airline 's mini-food around their plates . The magnificent clothes , in spite of devoted care , had become rumpled , and there was even a celebratory stain or two befouling a sleeve or lapel . The men stretched and dozed against their women for a while , and finally began to shed their hangovers as the pilot called out some of New York 's points of interest . Talk then began in a low , warm , satisfied way about Ali 's performance , but the subject quickly changed when one of the participants announced that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had occurred after the fight . It seemed that invitations had been sent out to selected visitors to attend a victory party in the Atlanta suburbs , but when the guests , seeking fra ? ternal conviviality , arrived , they were met by an inhospitable group of men with shotguns . The victim was asked to describe what happened . " What 's to tell , man . I stepped in the door and a dude put a sawed-off shotgun in my face . " " Owee ! You do n't mess with that ! " " Course you do n't . Then this man tells me to lay on the floor . T say to him there 's too many people on the floor already . Ai n't no room . He says , ' Lay on top of somebody . ' " " Which you did . " " Which I definitely did . Then somebody starts emptying out my pockets and throwing the stuff into the hall where , dig , there 's this cat sweeping up all the money , watches , and shit with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yeah , I almost laughed too . I mean sweeping the shit up into nice little neat piles . How cool can you be ? " " How many men was there waitin ' for you ? " " Too many ! " The men laughed and sagely shook their heads over how outlandish the world can be at times . An order to fasten seat belts was given and there were a few moments of reflective quiet . Then the victim let loose a long , contented sigh . " Something like that had to happen , " he said . " It was a bad weekend down in Georgia . " The men laughed some more to let each other fully appreciate , before the plane touched home , how good the last days really had been .
