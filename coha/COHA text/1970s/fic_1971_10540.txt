" Gloria ! " " It 's true ! You know what that bikini looks like to me ? It looks like something some tacky go-go dancer would wear to tease old men . I do n't know why you do n't take it right off . What do you think , Junior ? " Junior says , " I do n't care what she wears . " Junior 's got a beautiful grin , which comes from not having an uptight bone in his body . Sheila 's really off balance now . " You mean , " she says to Junior , " you do n't care if your sister runs around naked in broad daylight in front of her boy friend ? " Junior gave her an are-you-kidding look , thereby deftly reminding her that she and Martin have been making it every chance they could get for the last three months . Then he says , " I could dig going naked myself . Okay , Shee ? " Junior 's his own man in practically every department , but at sixteen he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I honestly do n't care what you kids do , " she lies . " But what if somebody drives up or something ? " Junior is already slipping out of his trunks . " If somebody drives up , we put our clothes on . " " Precisely , " I chime in . " John ? What about you ? The rest of us are going naked today . " " Not the rest of us ! " Sheila says . " I 'm checking with Martinfirst . " John , wearing T-shirt and jeans , is having a tough moment . I 'm not sure he likes his own body . But wow , if he could get used to having it seen , what a boost it would be for him . He says , " You really want me to , Gloria ? " " Only if you want to . " I have to be careful of a certain moon-in-Scorpio tendency to push other people into going along on my trips . John stands up and starts to undo his belt . He tries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his T-shirt , but his face is somber . As usual , I 'm tempted to worry about him , but I remind myself I 'm not really his mother . And even if I am , it 's time he was weaned . Then Martin comes in , holding a towel in front of himself . " Morning everybody . John says we 're going naked . " He looks at me , and then at Junior , and then he takes his towel off , tosses it back into the bedroom , and comes across the room to kiss Sheila . He comes over to the stove and I pour him some coffee . Sheila says , " Martin , what about me ? Shall I ? " " Shall you what ? " The gorgeous thing about Martin is that he really did n't know what she was talking about . Martin 's totally natural . He 's 21 , has this wonderful **30;12448;TOOLONG hair . I always think of him as the perfect child of the universe , truly free and un-hung up . ( Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have any , and he 's always making messy little deals with his father . ) ( But I do n't hold money against anyone . It 's a perversionanyway . John , my beautiful friend-guru who understandspractically everything , says that during the Piscean Age , the entire world operated on money  --  sort of like oil  --  and that now , in the Aquarian Age , money does n't really work any more and it 's lousing everything up . He says the new oil will be love , and when people get used to the plenty that technology is producing for us , they 'll stop hoarding and grabbing . Money will disappear altogether , love will take over , and everything will be fine . ) Anyway , Martin the Almost Pure says to Sheila , " Shall you what ? " Sheila says , " Never mind , " and takes off her bikini . Then poor John comes slinking back into the room , workingvery hard at not hiding his darling little genitals with his hands , and I find myself loving him more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me . Everything hep34does , every breath I catch him taking , makes me love him more . He lies on the floor again , reading , his cute white butt all perky and shiny . Actually his body looks quite nice . The sun is doing wonders for the pimples on his back , and even the old acne scars are sort of blending in . His shoulders are not fantastic , but they 're okay , and with a few more pounds on his ribs , he 'll be fine . A while later , sitting on the porch swing , I look up from my writing and watch all my beloved friends and cousins in the midst of their high , happy Sunday , enjoying the freedomfrom threads I had the good sense to nudge them into . Junior . Fly-casting off the dock , but not using bait because all the fish are dead . He does it for practice . Martin and Sheila . Stretched out on sun chairs . Their fingertipstouch and they get up , as if each of them heard the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand in hand , a perfect Adam and Eve . But they ca n't go swimming because Paradise is fucked up . That 's the awful thing about lakes when they die . There 's no burying them . They just go right on tempting you with their beauty , shimmering and splashing away same as ever . We hardly ever talk about its deadness any more , because of a sort of unspoken pact not to bum each other . But I know the others are always thinking about it , too . John , for instance . He 's sitting cross-legged under the weeping willow , facing out across the water . This Hesse book has him really turned on to meditation . I 'm hoping he 'll learn how and show me , because I 'm a lousy meditator . You 're supposed to empty your mind , but mine wo n't empty . The more I try , the fuller it gets . And so , hoping John has discovered something he canp35teach me , but not wanting to disturb him , I walk softly down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him . I study John 's naked back . Owing to his extreme skinniness , the long line of marbles running down his spine is very distinct , each marble glistening in the sun . The earth mother in me wants to cover him up . Not to hide him , but to protect him . From what ? The sun ? I do n't know from what . I close my eyes and try to empty my mind , but it seems impossible . Every thought I get rid of is replaced by ten others . Finally I decide to sit still with my eyes open and just groove on everything . Way out in the middle of the lake a boat passes by . Some butterflies are doing a number in the willow tree . An ant crawls on my foot and tickles my instep . I send the ant a thought telegram : Dear ant , you are welcome to walk around on me if you like , but please walk where it does n't tickle . Because if I brush you off you could easily get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my toenail and sits perfectly still , probably trying to meditate with John and me . I 'm so pleased about getting through to the ant that I close my eyes . And , wonder of wonders , my mind is actually empty for a few seconds . I see this beautiful light inside . It 's not blindingor anything , and I know I have n't reached any fabulous stage of illumination , but for a moment at least , I 'm not thinking about being me . I 'm being me . And I 'm quiet and happy . And then I hear something , but not quite with my ears . I look up , and I see John . He has moved over and is sitting down near me . My soul smiles . So does John 's . We look at one another . He says , " Gloria , I got something to tell you . " I know it 's something wonderful . My eyes say , Go ahead , John , what is it ? And John says , out loud but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what he 's talking about , but with John , I 've learned to shut up and listen . " What happened was this , " he says . " I 'm looking at the lake and I 'm thinking , Wow , how can you be dead if you 're so fucking beautiful ? " ( I 'm tempted to interrupt him , to tell him I was having the same thought , probably at the same moment , but I restrain myself . ) " So I decide to meditate , " John continues . " I close my eyes and sit still , and in just a couple of seconds , I 'm way off in the most outer outer space there is , looking back at the world . And suddenly I get this super-multi-megaton blast of clear vision , and I see Lake Erie . It 's like a powerful white light , and out of the light comes this image of Jesus in the tomb , right after He was wasted . And that 's it . " He stops talking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I do n't . So he continues . " Jesus died for what ? Our sins , right ? " " Did he really ? I thought you told me it was a political thing ? " " Oh , it was ! Definitely it was political . Christ was a fantasticradical . Only . . . Only now I 'm getting mixed up . " " I should have kept quiet . " " No , that 's okay . I 'm getting it again . Oh , now I 've got it ! Christ comes along and he says , Listen , you bunch of ninnies , do n't you know you 're divine ? Well , you are ! You 're just like me . And I 'm God , for Christ sake . And so are you . That means you got to love each other because that 's what being God is all about . ' So ! What happens is the fucking state lays a wiretap on him . Caesar overhears this love rap Jesus is putting out , and he gets very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loving each other all over the place  --  you know , trusting and sharing and all the other love goodies  --  well then , what 's the state going to do ? It 's fucked , do n't you see ? It 's not needed any more , it goes out of business . Are you with me so far ? "  |p37I  nodded . " Okay . So they kill Jesus to shut him up . But does he really die ? " " No . " " Right . " John falls silent . After a moment , I say , " Go on , John . I 'm getting it , but I have n't really got it yet . " " Urn . What was I saying ? " " Christ did n't really die . " " Right . Jesus cooled . But not Christ . Christ is the idea . And the idea of love grew . It grew very very very slowly for a couple of thousand years , but it did keep growing , until , um . " Until what ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . My mind 's sort of wilting . I ca n't keep it together . " " Have you been smoking ? " " Junior and I had a couple of tokes . " " Well , do n't hassle your head . I 'll write down what you said and we 'll look at it later . Okay ? " " Okay . But I think I 'm really saying something , are n't I ? " " Definitely ! " Dear Gloria , I hope you do n't mind me writing in your notebook like this , but I did n't want to wreck your nap just to ask your permission . Anyway , about this Christ and Lake Erie business . Christ 's love rap kept growing really slow for about 2000 years and then all of a sudden just quite recently , probably while you and I were kids , something like exploded . Love started to really take hold and that 's why the shit 's hitting the fan . The state is bigger than ever and there 's not just one Jesus any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going around now laying on his rap and all the Caesars are trying to shut them up . You know what I mean by Caesar . The state . And not just the USA either , but all the governments in the world . And the Jesuses are n't just longhairs , they 're all the people who dig this love rap . I hope you can follow me now . I was a little stoned before . Excuse me for scribbling in your notebook , but you do n't care , do you ? Oh , I almost forgot about Lake Erie . What I meant was Jesus died to teach us love of man , and Lake Erie died to teach us love of the earth . So long . See you when you wake up . Love , John . P.S. You look pretty sleeping , in case you want to know . On the bus , 5:45 a.m . Each moment of my life is some new kind of magic . For instance , at this very moment I am inside of an enormous machine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the last several miles , until I sat up to write this , I 've had my head resting on the shoulder of a skinny young creature named Roy , half angel , half animal . It was n't very comfortable , but it was fabulously cozy . Traveling at night on a bus with a good friend next to you is a whole special thing.  |p39WESTERN  UNION OFFICE , NEW YORK CITY , FRIDAY , SEPTEMBER 5 , 1969I 'm miserable . I 'm ashamed . I 'm frightened . I 'm numb . I 'm nervous . And I 'm grinding my teeth from that Dexedrineof Roy 's . I could kill him for giving it to me . Oh , God , I do n't mean that , truly I do n't . It 's not poor beautiful Roy 's fault . Each of us is the captain of his own head . Nobody has to drop any pill he does n't want to drop . It 's myself I 'm angry with . I know I ca n't handle speed in any form and yet I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely . I and nobody else am the dumb shit who swallowed the wicked thing . Take ten deep breaths . Think of the Buddha within . There . I feel better now . Not a whole lot , but a little . At least I 've stopped thinking about my fucking self long enough to pray that Roy is not lying dead in a gutter somewhere . And I 've stopped grinding my teeth . Dear Roy , wherever you are , please be alive , please be brave , please survive whatever awful thing is being done to you . Please come back in one piece . Please heal me with your love.  |p40I  can hardly bear to record what 's happened to us , but I 've got to because if I do n't my mind will run away with me in a total , uncontrolled freak-out . I am sitting at the Western Union office on Third Avenue waiting for a money order from Belle Woods , Michigan . Two hours ago , I telegraphed the following lies to Mother : IN DIRE STRAITS COMING HOME SEND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIINGS LOVE GLORIAAll lies , the whole thing ! Lie #1 . We were not in dire straits . We were n't even hungry . We were only broke , and not even completely . We had $19 left . Lie #2 . We have no intention of going home . Lie #3 . I do n't believe I was wrong about anything . I only said so because I know being right gives Mother a temporaryhigh , which I 'm counting on to induce some generosityso she 'll send more than I asked for . Lie #4 . Love . That 's not what I was feeling at all . I was feeling cute and smart and darling . Whereas the simple fact is that I 'm cheap and stupid and calculating . Two days here and we 've flopped already . The worst aspect of our failure is not just the unearthly speed of it . We have n't even been behaving well . Not we . I ! Roy is a saint . I 'm the one who 's mean . I do n't smile . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little for Roy . No . It 's more than a little . It 's quite a bit actually , but it 's being crowded out by panic because my bad-news bells are ringing away inside of me right now and I 'm terrified for him . How can I keep on sitting here ? It could take hours for the money to come and my composure is coming apart . Composure ? Ha . I have n't had a scrap of it since yesterday morning.  |p41We  got off the bus feeling like a couple of zombies . We 'd only slept about an hour the whole trip , but we did n't feel tired until the bus got into New York . Then I started hallucinatingbeds everywhere I looked . I wanted to lie down on a bench right there in the terminal but it was hot and grim and noisy and against the law , and Roy talked me out of it . We went to a telephone booth and tried to find Glyczwycz in the Manhattan directory . No luck . Roy said I should try the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was furious . I had n't expected it to be easy to locate my father , but I 'm a badly spoiled chick . I want miracles . All the time . And when they do n't happen , I get pissed off , especially when I 'm tired . We leave the bus station and find ourselves in the streets of this godawful city , dragging our bags and our little butts behind us . I ca n't go on . This is putting me on a bummer and I refuse to do it . I 'm simply not willing to wallow all over again in the misery of the past two days just for the sake of my goddamautobiography . I 'll do it in shorthand : New York hell . Insanity commonplace . Dog turds everywhere . Constant noise . Air filthy , causes nose and skin to itch . Traffic thick . More horns than cars . Roy says , Look , Witch , here 's Broadway ! Witch not impressed . Obsessed with thought of bathtub . We head for East Village . Roy leads way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I refuse to cry . Waiting on platform for Astor Place train , Roy whips out two Dexedrine caps . Witch grabs one . No water fountain . Ladies ' room requires nickel . No nickels . I pop Dexy . Ca n't swallow . No spit . Much choking . Full panic . Roy grabs soft drink from Puerto Rican lady . Puerto Rican lady too helpful . Each time I try swallow , she slaps my back . Train comes.  |p42Get  off Astor Place . Walk to Third . Check in at awful hotel . Feel like fugitive in hiding . No hot water . Mattress damp . Wonder from what ? Dexedrines take effect . We lie down . Try to rest . Giggle instead . Hug each other . Get excitedabout seeing East Village . Start out . Pass prostitute and customer in hall . Roy and I flash peace sign . Prostitute flashes it back . Our first sister in New York . Hideous streets suddenly seem fabulous . Roy consults Delano 's map . We start flying . Down Third toward St. Mark 's Place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books . Posters . Bead shops . Head shops . Electric Circus . New York like downtown Detroit . ioo per cent business . No houses ! Roy spots Fillmore East . We race down there . Theater closed . We stand in lobby , soak up leftover vibes from TimothyLeary , Mothers , Jefferson Airplane , Doors , etc . I get goose pimples . Roy 's mouth falls open . Suddenly black cat crosses our path . Name is Winston . No more shorthand . I 've got to slow down to do Winstonjustice . Winston is black , handsome , well built . He speaks softly , has an accent that sounds sort of calypso and turns out to be Virgin Islands . He 's elegant and cool , has penetrating , gentle eyes . Wears a suit . Never smiles . Never blinks his eyes . " Hello , my friends . " He nods at me , then turns to Roy . " How you doing , mon ? " The word is man , but he makes it sound like a title . We fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , and his eyebrows go up . I think , Wow , on those islands , they may not dig witches . So I smile and tell him I 'm a white witch and my magic is love . " Love . " He nods agreement . " I 'm with you , mom . " Wasp43he calling me ma'am or mother ? I 'll never know . " Love , " he says , " very good thing . Peace , too . " Much agreeing , nodding , flashing of peace signs . Brotherhoodis established . Now we get to what 's on Winston 's mind . " You like to score some hosh , mon ? " he says to Roy . Roy says , " Hosh ? " And I say , " Hash , Roy . Hashish . " Winston looks to the right and to the left without moving his cool head much at all . Then in an even quieter voice than usual , " I can get you top grade hosh-eesh , mon . " Roy 's so thrilled , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hash that excites him . It 's the scoring . This would be his first dope purchase in New York . I dig it , too , but mostly I dig Roy 's digging it . " How much ? " Roy asks . " It all depends . You want quantity ? " " Yeah , quantity . But just a small quantity . Because we do n't have much bread . " " How much ? " Roy looks at me , says , " Small conference ? " By this time we 're out in the sunshine , leaning against the fender of a parked car . Winston bows elegantly . " You like for me to step aside , good people ? " " No , no , " Roy says . " It 's okay . " Roy and I talk , using the ultra-quiet secret language , no melody , no facial expressions . It sounds like mumblejumbleto everybody but us . Winston discreetly scans the sky and steps back a pace . Roy : What do you think we can afford ? WITCH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ROY : How much we got ? WITCH : About twenty-nine dollars . Roy : Is he really a brother ? WITCH : I ca n't tell.  |p44Roy  : Me either . I thought maybe you could . WITCH : He 's too good-looking . My judgment is wrecked . Roy : I know what you mean . WITCH : YOU dig him , too ? Roy : Sort of . But how come he never smiles ? WITCH : Does n't blink his eyes either . ROY : Maybe we better forget it . WITCH : Right . We have n't even got jobs yet . ROY : Okay . WITCH : Besides , who needs hash ? We 're high anyway . ROY : True . Roy tells Winston our decision . We apologize for using up his time and offer to buy him a cup of coffee . He bows . " No , thank you very much , my friends . I bid you good day , long life . " Still no smile , no blink . But he nods nicely . Roy and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . New York is looking great . Everything is either gorgeous , or gorgeous-awful . The only thing that 's just awful , period , is the junk all over the streets and sidewalks . Every kind of garbage imaginable . I mention it to Roy . Roy , fantastic guru that he is , suggests that if our heads are in the right place , we can groove on it , get to where we really dig the litter everywhere . I tell him I agree entirely , but I wonder if we can ever learn to dig the dog turds . Roy is convinced we can . So we sit on a bench and look at some dog Curds , trying to groove on them . About three benches away , an enormous German shepherd is dropping a nice steaming specimen for us . Roy and I both spot it at once , and exchange a glance . " How you doing ? " he says . I shake my head . " I 'm not making it . How about you ? " " A little headway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " Well , " he says , " what I 'm doing is I 'm thinking about the soul of that dog . " " I 'll give it a try . " So I try it . I think of the dog 's soul , and I give it a Secret Zap . Then I say , " Roy , that 's not his soul crapping up the side-walk . " Roy nods , ponders a while longer . Then he says , " Everythingthat comes from the human body is sacred . Shit , piss , cum , spit , hair , the whole thing . " " That 's humans though . Right ? " " You think human turds are better ? " " I guess not . " " Besides , dogs are sacred , too . Are n't they ? All living things ? " " Absolutely . Every little cockroach . " Roy looks at the fresh pile again , regards it with great seriousness . Then he says , " I do n't know if I can make it a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , " I say . " Let 's not force ourselves . " " Right . " We walk over to Avenue B , where everything gets really thick . Every kind of person imaginable , all colors and sizes and styles and genders , milling madly around , each on his own trip . I fall in and out of love three or four times , very quietly , nothing wild . Each affair lasts a half a block or so . Suddenly it 's twilight . Roy and I both find ourselves hung up on an old Slavic lady with great cheekbones and an enormousjunk collection . Lots of people like junk , but this lady carries hers with her in these miraculous shopping bags that somehow hold things even when they 're terribly torn . She stops at a wire trash barrel to collect more goodies , then empties out her entire stash to rearrange it on the sidewalk : jelly glasses , rusty coat hangers , broken clocks , magazines without covers.  |p46I  say , " Roy , she 's got it made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " Yeah , but I think she 's hung up . " We move along . We go into this weird cave-type coffee place where all the longhairs are mad at us . I wonder what for ? We flash peace signs . Nobody flashes back . I sotto-voce to Roy , " They look like brothers . What 's wrong ? " Roy shrugs . " Maybe they 're on reds . Let 's split . " And I think , If that 's what Seconals produce , they could really hurt the revolution ! Suddenly I got this awful fit of depression and had to stop writing . Then this kind Western Union man started a conversation . I guess I look scared and he wants to comfort me . But it made me even more anxious than ever trying to keep up a conversation when I know something awful is happening to Roy . That 's all I can think about . Sitting still does n't help , and kindness does n't comfort me . I 'll have to keep writing . After we got out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our heads , because we kept attracting bummers , one after another . Sick-looking kids  --  our age , more or less  --  kept stopping us on St. Mark 's Place , asking for money . The first bunch were so scroungy-looking , we gave them a dollar . And then , I do n't know exactly how it happened , but suddenly these sad-looking types kept appearingout of nowhere , telling us their stories , and we kept handing out our money like there 's no tomorrow . Roy kept saying , " They 're worse off than we are , Witch . " And I kept agreeing . We 'd given away seven dollars before I saved usp47from total ruin by giving vent to a neat little wave of fury . This filthy chick with electric hair was sitting on some steps , and she actually hollered at us when we walked by . " Hey ! Give me some bread ! " It was like a demand . I stopped dead in my tracks and looked straight at her . A total mess , pimples , pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God knows what under her fingernails . Her hair looked like it had died and gone to hell . Suddenly  --  why so late ?  --  it dawns on me what 's happening . I 'd been vaguely wondering why our generosity had been bringing us down . Is n't love supposed to help your high ? How come then both Roy and I kept feeling worse instead of better . The more we gave the more desperate and scared we felt . I look at this chick 's eyes , and they 're like the barrels of a couple of mean little guns pointed at us . That 's what gave me my big flash . All these people we 've been slopping over with our darling icky kindness were just a tacky tribe of bloodsuckers spaced out on drugs . They acted as if all they knew about brotherhood had come from a quick course at the Pentagon . Witch moon-in-Scorpio Me  --  I think I 'm learning to respectmy awful side  --  sprang like a snake . God knows what I told her . I was brilliant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way , I had . I started with How dare she shout at me and make demands . Then she made her fatal mistake , she looked at me half amused , half disdainful , like I 'm some uptight little fluff from suburbia that does n't know her ass from a hypodermic needle . So I let her have it . I told her she and everybody like her were undermining the entire revolution . It was a fabulous speech , I wish to hell I had it on tape . But here 's the really awful part . She heard me . She really heard me . I 'd made her feel like a totally unsacredlittle dog turd . And she started crying . So I joinedp48her . Pretty soon we 're all sitting on this stoop , Roy on one side , me on the other , and this poor smelly little wreck in the middle , and we 're all hugging each other and saying how all right everything 's going to be . Pretty soon I noticed her eyes were scanning the street again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our thing together was over . Roy and I got up and walked away . The good-byes were more or less scattered . She hardly noticed we were leaving . I guess she had crystals on her mind , poor dear . I do n't know what time it was . Seems like it had been dark for ages . Roy and I walked back to Third Avenue and without even talking it over we headed for the hotel , holdinghands all the way . The Dexedrine was still doing its number in our heads , but our bodies were tired . I simply ached all over , and I know Roy was dying on his feet because his beautiful big eyes were just a couple of pink slits and his pimples stood out more than ever . At the hotel , we talked . No , we did n't talk . We rapped . We rapped forever . We went over every little thing that had happened . Our doped minds were like hot little tongues and they licked in and out of every little corner of the entire day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally we got undressed and rubbed each other 's backs . I noticed Roy 's cock was shriveled up to nothing . Delano said men get that way when they 're speeding . I do n't know what happens to women , but if I 'm any sample , they begin to feel like witches . Not white ones either . Old and purple and ugly . We stayed in the room for quite a while . There was almostconstant emergency-type noise . Banging in the halls . Arguments . Screaming . Sirens . Roy said we 'd get used to it . I sat on the window sill trying to breathe but all the air was secondhand . Roy did his Yoga . Then , sitting there looking into the street and hating everything in sight , I flashed on the ending of an old dream I used to have . There 's not much to it . I try to scream andp49ca n't because my voice does n't work . Then the dream itself came back , the whole thing . In the dream , Mother 's chaise longue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear . I sneak into her room naked and lie there feeling the fur on my body . I turn over and lie on my tummy . The fur feels wonderful on my breasts , but just when I 'm really getting into it , Mother comes and catches me . This memory is so strong I wonder if it was only a dream ? But I know it could n't actually have happenedbecause there 's no bearskin on her chaise . It 's just chintz . Anyway , she starts calling me terrible names and comes after me , so I run downstairs and out of the house . The back yard becomes a great forest , but it 's Mother 's forest and therefore not a real one . ( Nothing of Mother 's is real ! ) And she 's still chasing me . So I try to scream , but I ca n't . Because the rule of the dream is that your voice ca n't work unless the forest you 're in is real . " Roy , " I said . " I know I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do your Yoga , but listen to me , will you , for a minute ? Someday , before I die  --  as soon as possible in fact  --  I want to go into a forest naked and make a terrible noise . Can you understand that ? " I could actually feel him thinking it over . This is one of the reasons he 's so perfect to talk to . He hears you . He takes what you say inside of himself and really gets the feel of it before he answers . Especially when it 's important like this . " What kind of a noise will it be ? " he said . " A scream or a song or a prayer or what ? " " It does n't matter , " I said . " It 'll just be the sound I make . " " A really terrible sound ? " " Absolutely terrible . " " Yeah , " he said . " I could dig that . " " Roy . We 've made a mistake , have n't we ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lotus posi/tion . " What we did wrong was we picked the wrong scene . We should n't have picked New York . " " It 's my fault . " " No , " Roy said . " We both decided . " " Yes , but I had this big thing about I 've got to find my father . If it had n't been for that , maybe we 'd have gone to Boulder or Laguna Beach or Big Sur or someplace beautiful . " " We can still do that . " " With no money ? " " Not right away , but later maybe . " So we had fantasy talk about what it must be like in California , and about all the communities we 'd heard about in Colorado . And when we ran down again , I said , " Roy , if you decide to split for Canada , I 'll be with you completely . I just want you to know that . " " You think we should ? " " I do n't know . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money left , do n't you think ? " Neither of us felt we were thinking clearly enough to make a good decision , so we went for a walk , hoping the change of scene would help . By the time we got dressed and into the streets it was 6 A.M. The sun was coming up and we got high just on dawn alone . You ca n't get a complete view of the sunrise in New York , but on certain streets you can see all the way over to the river where the light is strongest . We walked over to West Village and had scrambled eggs and toast at an all-nightery on Sheridan Square , then walked all the way back to Third Avenue . People were climbing in and out of the subway holes , populating the day . It was sort of nerve-racking seeing all these people running around doingtheir thing , and us not even having jobs . On the way upstairs , that same black prostitute smiled atp51us . I thought she must be headed for the streets again , and wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and tried to sleep and I think we succeeded for a while . But what I remember most clearly is lying there with my eyes wide open wondering what the fuck we were going to do next . For a while at least I must have blacked out , because when I opened my eyes I saw Roy sitting in the middle of the floor , fully dressed , in the lotus position . He said he was trying to get at his inner resources to help him through the day . I got down on the floor with him , but neither of us were able to meditate . There was too much clutter in our heads , so we decided instead to get into some old-fashioned praying . Roy said he thought if we were really serious about it we ought to do it on our knees . " But if we 're God , " I said , " who are we getting on our knees to ? " Roy thought about the question for a minute . Then he said , " I do n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then what are we doing it for ? Just in case ? " " God takes all these different forms , " Roy said , " you and I are just two of them . I guess what you pray to is all the forms you ca n't see . " " Spirits ? " " Yeah . Like that , I guess . " " Okay . Let 's go . " Then Roy said , " Listen , if we 're going to pray to the spirits , I think I 'll address a few of them by name . Why not ? " " Go ahead , " I told him . " Okay . I 'll say the names , and you say them after me . " We got to our knees and Roy started right in . " Dear Buddha . " " Dear Buddha . " " Dear Jesus . " " Dear Jesus . " " Dear Carl Jung. "  | " Dear Carl Jung . " " Dear Mohammed . " " Dear Mohammed . " " Dear Hermann Hesse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X. " " Dear Malcolm X. " " Can you think of anybody else ? " " What about Martin Luther King ? " " Sure . Dear Martin Luther King . " " " Dear Martin Luther King . " " I guess the prayer is just Please help us get our trip together . Right ? " He looked at me . " Right . " " Shall we say it together ? " I nodded . And then , together , we said , " Please help us get our trip together . Amen . " While we were getting ready to go out , I said , " Do you think any of them really heard us ? " And Roy said , " In a way , I do . Do n't you ? " " In a way , definitely . Definitely . " We spent the day looking for jobs . We split up for little intervals , each of us going his own way and meeting back at the hotel to exchange news . But there was n't much to exchange . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed any clerks . Nobody did . Roy went to Everythingfor Everybody . Delano said they could help longhairs get jobs , but the girl there told Roy you had to " join , " which cost $15 . Besides , she said , he looked too young to fill any of the openings they had today . This age thing is a problem we had n't considered . Roy 's 19 , but he looks 16 , and he ca n't show his papers , becausep53when you go underground , you ca n't use your real name . If you do , the Army can trace you . He got this notion that if he wore glasses he 'd look older . So we went to the dime store on 8th Street and bought a pair . I did n't think they helped at all , but Roy did . By then it was after five and the business day was ended , but Roy wanted to test his glasses on some late-hour bookshops , hopingone of them might need a clerk or a stockboy . Meanwhile , I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd rather not write about . But I have to . Because if I do n't I 'll start thinking about the fact that I 've been waiting here at Western Union forever andROY IS NOT BACK YET ! ! ! That black prostitute was on the corner of 9th and Third Avenue when I passed by . We smiled at each other and I went upstairs . About two minutes later there was a knock on my door . " Just passing by , " she said . " Thought I 'd pay a visit . " She came in and we sat on my bed and swapped names . Hers was Loretta . We rapped for a few minutes . I acted terribly surprised when she told me what she did for a living . I have to face the fact that when somebody throws me for a loop , my first reaction is to say something phony . For instance , I said , " You 'd never know it to look at you , " when that 's exactly how I did know it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing I believed though . I told her I thought prostitution was a perfectly splendid profession . At first she looked puzzled , but pretty soon I sold her on what a fine public service she was performing . Then I started rapping about all the great courtesans of history , their genius in divining the needs of men and changing the course of human destiny . I have no idea why I carried on so . The poor thing seemed so flattened by her life , I guess Ip54wanted to fluff her up a little . Then she said , " Baby , if you think it be such a picnic , how come you looking for a job selling shit in some store ? If a gal digs working on her back , what the fuck she want to be on her feet all day for ? " So I actually considered it for a while . Finally I said I did n't think I could do it and stay in a good head , because it might make me anxious and depressed . I tried to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I convinced Loretta that whoring was depressing , maybe it would start depressing her . I hate lying , but I hate even worse to bum somebody else 's trip . So I tried to end the discussion by telling her she was right , it was all talk , and I 'd just been trying to hide from her the fact that I was too chicken even to attempt it . And then this totally wild thing happened . She put her arm around me and said , " How ' bout starting with me ? Lie down with me a while , I give you fi ' dollars . " So I just threw back my head and laughed and laughed . Said I thought she had the best sense of humor of anybody I 'd ever met in my entire life . I managed to get off the bed by pretending the joke was so tremendous I had to stand up to finish laughing . By the time I 'd worked my way over to the other side of the room , sides splitting all the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check her reaction . Loretta was not smiling . Not a flicker . Her face was as dark as a well , and at the bottom of it her eyes were peering up at me , steady as a cat 's . She said , " You think I 'm funny ? " I said , " No ! Oh , no ! You and I are sisters , I do n't think you 're funny at all . But I thought you were joking . Honestly I did . " Next thing I knew I was launched into this big routine about how fabulous lesbianism is . There was a lot of truth in what I said , too . I just know the right woman ( Cecilia ,  |p55for  instance ) could turn me on to making love . But that room and that woman and that moment  --  Oh , God , I wanted out of there with all my heart . Loretta was n't buying all my fancy talk either . When I ran out of wind , she was still sitting there with that same expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stood up and came over to me . " You been playing with me , honey . You nothing but a big phony . " I admitted to being a phony , but I swore I had n't been playing with her . I told her I loved her like a sister or a friend , and that I 'd been trying to be worldly and clever . I apologized , I took vows , I rapped on and on . But she did n't believe a word I said . She slapped me . Hard . On the cheek . She said she ought to tear me apart . And she slapped me again . Even harder . Then she said , " I find you in this hotel tonight , I turn y'pretty white face into a mess of spare ribs . " She was n't kidding either . Her eyes told me she was just the kind of chick who could come up with the necessary kitchen equipmentto get the job done , too . My mind saw cleavers and paring knives and can openers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I think she was considering gettingat it immediately instead of waiting till night came . But then all of a sudden she left the room . It took me no more than 30 seconds to get Roy 's and my things together . I hated my cowardice and I loathed my fear , but violence is just unbearable to me . I stood on the street and waited for Roy . I thought he 'd never come , but he did . He was discouraged , too , and trying to hide it . I did n't tell him what had happened in detail . I just said there 'd been some trouble up there and I thought the spirits we 'd prayed to at noon probably felt it was time for us to relocate . He was tired , so we went to Tompkins Square Park andp56did the bench scene until the sun had set . No sleep , of course , but we held hands while we rested and told our days to each other . Roy has never failed to give me the feeling that he loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the seventh grade . No matter how scared or worried he is , I always get some kind of a Zap from being with him . Even now , sitting here wondering if he 's dead or alive and knowing that whatever has happened to him it ca n't be good , not in the least , I still feel this Zap coming at me . If only I knew from where ! If only it was a ray of light I could see and followand go to the end of and find him . But it 's not . I 'll just have to sit here until he comes , even if I wither up and die or get hauled off to a hospital or an asylum . It is now Friday , September 5 , 1969 . Three hours ago ( was that all ? ) Roy and I were sitting on a bench in TompkinsSquare Park having the following conversation : WITCH : I 've been thinking . Roy : Me , too . WITCH : Money ? ROY : Yeah . WITCH : How much is left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got an idea . RoY : What ? WITCH : A swindle . ROY : Really ? WITCH : Really . ROY : Go on . WITCH : I send a wire to Mother . Roy : And tell her what ? WITCH : I 'm coming home and have to have bus fare . Roy : Wow.  |p57WITCH  : They can afford it . Do you know how much they were willing to spend on sending me to Radcliffe ? RoY : How much ? WITCH : I do n't know . But plenty . And do you know where they get it ? Stocks . General Dynamics , General Motors , every general you can think of . RoY : Bombers , jeeps , rockets , flame throwers , napalm . WITCH : That 's the picture ! So why should n't I promote a measly hundred dollars to help the revolution ? Can you name me one good reason ? RoY : Well , it 's .. . WITCH : Dishonest ? RoY : Yeah . WITCH : Shit . RoY : I know . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . The Western Union man told us it would probably take a number of hours , at least four or five , even if Mother wired the money immediately . Roy was hungry , so we went to the Paradox , this macrobioticrestaurant Delano had marked on the map . My stomachwas having post-Dexedrine anxiety fits , but I had a couple of bites of Roy 's fish and drank some tea . Then Roy got this perfectly awful idea , which at the time sounded like sheer genius . He said , " Look , if we 're getting all this money , why do n't we score some grass ? " The very thought of it undid me . So we went flying up 7th Street , hoping to find a dealer hanging around in front of the Gem Spa on St. Mark 's Place . Something happened on the way that might have saved us a lot of hell , if we 'd used our heads . But we did n't . We were too interested in getting them stoked ! An Indian boyp58was sitting on some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valiant . They both smiled even before I did , so we stopped and talked . The Indian boy 's name was Carl , he came from Quebec . His friend was Danny , from Key West . We told them where we were at  --  waiting for money , looking for grass , no place to stay , etc . Carl said he was in exactly the same situation . But it did n't seem to worry him . He was into a craft called " macrome , " making things out of rope , and while we talked he was working on a belt . He said he was at peace because he followed the wisdomof the I Ching and went along with whatever the oracle said . Roy 's ears perked up . He 'd been wanting to throw a change anyway , so Carl got out his copy and helped . Roy borrowed my journal to make notes in . I was n't paying much attention because I was too busy falling in love with Danny . By the time I realized what was happening , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7th Street . I emanated . I Secret Zapped , my gaze lingered and darkened , I wove dreams of gossamer into a little net and just as it was falling about his 14th-century head , along came this let 's face it beautiful Hungarian chick named Sandie and plucked him out from under me . Turns out he 'd been waiting for her all along . Ah , well . I watched them walk away , watched them all the way up to First Avenue and watched them turn the corner . I was n't sad , but I was depleted . I 've had dozens of these spiritual quickies and I'm. usually fairly philosophicalabout them when they end . But after putting out all that magic and then watching it disappear up the street , I felt the barrel was getting pretty empty . So when Roy told me about throwing these trigrams and hexagrams and coming up with something called " The Darkening of the Light , " I just nodded and said it sounded pretty accurate . But I was n't really listening . He said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to agreep59was that we were supposed to persevere . So we said goodbye to Carl and started right in persevering on the trail of some grass . Neither of us were surprised to see Winston again . He was leaning on a mailbox at the next corner , right across from Fillmore East . The negotiations were endless . Winston did n't like doing small quantities , but he said ten of our nineteen dollars would get us a fat gram of some truly righteous hash , and because we were brothers , he did n't mind going to the trouble . Then he said we 'd have to walk with him clear over to the West Village , where the stuff was , because of course he was n't carrying . ( " No , mon , never carry . Never . " ) So we started walking toward Third Avenue , and I rememberwondering why Winston seemed to be thinking so hard . He walked with his eyes straight ahead and I do n't think he blinked once the whole time . At the corner he said he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once . The reason he gave was " too much traffic . " I was too tired to protest , so he and Roy left me at the Western Union office and went off together toward the West Village . And here I sit . He 's been gone an hour and a half . And there 's nothing left to think about . Except Roy 's I Ching notes . I just looked at them , and I 'm terrified . It says , " A man of dark nature is in a position of authority and brings harm to the wise and able man . "  |p60CANAL  STREET , SUNDAY , SEPTEMBER 7 , 1969Hare Krishna ! Roy and I have our highs back . Obviously we lead enchantedlives . The most hideous adventures imaginable turn into miracles before our very eyes . Life is too rich to bear . Everywhere we go , angels precede us and light our way with love . Must never ever lose faith again , even for a second . I hereby vow not to . At this moment I am sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vegetable soup , and my belovedRoy is downstairs cleaning out the fireplace . We have become part of a beautiful family . There are about ten of us altogether , and we live in a terrific haunted ramshackle house just a block from the Hudson River . It looks like I 'm becoming co-housemother , because out of four chicks , only two of us can really get our heads into a cooking trip . I 'm a little edgy about it . They 're on a macrobiotic diet and the kitchen 's full of stuff I 've never seen before . For instance , what do you do with dried lotus root ? Smoke it ?  |p61Who  would have thought on Friday , when we were in hell , that by Sunday we 'd be comfortably established in the Kingdom of Heaven ? Comfortably is n't quite the word . I suppose compactly would be more accurate . Roy and I sleep on the floor in the hall . But we have a mattress all to ourselves , and it 's right under the stairwell , which makes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem , but we 've already dealt with them superbly . Roy drew a magic circle around our part of the hall and so far not one of them has trespassed . Also , I have lots of ideas for turning our alcove into a darling little gypsy cave . Roy has already tacked up our Desiderata poster . He put it upside down on the slant above us , so we can read it lying down just before we go to sleep . It 's our good-night prayer . When I get done with this entry , I 'll copy it down in my notebook as a spiritual discipline . Ever since we got off the bus I 've been speeding , and I 've simply got to slow myself down to normal . I 'm almost afraid to get weighed . I must have lost five pounds at least . But I look marvelous , very cheek-bony and low-key luscious . I suppose it 's tacky of me to be so pleased about that , but looking pretty helps my high , and anything that helps a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over everything I 'd written since Roy and I got off the bus and I can hardly believe how much has happened . It seems to me absolutely urgent that I keep the record up to date . Therefore , between stirrings of the soup , I will lure my mind back to the Western Union office : While I was sitting there trying to think of things to write , I heard a sudden frantic knock on the window right behind me . It was John . I mean Roy ( still have n't gotten used to his new name ) , and he was motioning for me to come outside . As a rule I 'm not a screamer , but I must have let out somep62audible sound because the telegraph clerk came running up to see what was the matter . I told him everything was fine and ran out to the sidewalk . Roy was all sweaty and out of breath , but I was so busy hugging him I hardly noticed the condition he was in . Also , his pants were missing . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms , covering him like a skirt . It only came to his knees , so there was this long stretch of skinny legs coming out of his combat boots . He looked so funny and pathetic , I was afraid I was going to do something awful , like laugh or cry . But I did n't . " Get me some pants out of my suitcase , " he said . " I just got ripped off . " I suddenly felt wonderful . I 'd been sitting there getting such a strong steady blast of horrible vibes , I hardly expected to see him alive again . And now , hearing he 'd only been robbed , it was like getting good news . At first Roy did n't want to come inside , but I assured him the Western Union clerk was a brother , and it 'd be much better than putting on his pants in the street . By this time , all we had left was 90 cents . But that was enough for coffee , so we went to a delicatessen on Second Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had happened to him . I 'd like to record the conversation exactly , but it was terribly disjointed and I had to ask a hundred questions . Still I think I 'll try to put it down the way Roy would have told it if he could have gotten it all together without me interrupting every three seconds . ROY 'S ROBBERYas told to Witch GlizWinston and I left you there at Western Union and started walking across 8th Street toward Greenwich Village , rappingp63all the way . I thought he was really a great guy . He told me all about life on the Islands and how he and his buddies stayed stoned all day and did nothing but swim and dive and pick bananas and mangoes off the trees . I asked him how come he was in New York , and he said it was just to make money . He 's got a connection in the Islands that ships him this fabulous grass and hash . Of course I do n't know how much of this is true , because if a guy lies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Winston was talking all this great-sounding shit , and I bought it all . In fact , I was taking a big interest in his whole trip . I was wondering how long he 'd have to be selling dope in New York to make enough bread to get back to his paradise . He said a few more deals and he 'd have it made . He said he usually dealt grass in kilos only and hash in ounces or more , so the profits came in goodsizedchunks . I told him I felt bad about wasting his time on our little dime of hash , but he said it was okay , Wednesdaywas an off night anyway . Then we stopped at a magazinestore because Winston had to make this phone call . He said he had to make sure it was cool to take me where we were going . I did n't know how these things were done , so I did n't see anything suspicious about it . Besides , by now I loved the guy . When he came out of the phone booth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now he did n't look at me . He just gave me a sign with his hand . So I followed him out to the street and we kept walking . Then he told me about the wild life he 's got going here in New York . He said he had this roommate and each of them had a chick and sometimes all four of them went to bed together . It all sounded pretty groovy to me . When we got to Macdougal Street he stopped in a cigar store to make another phone call . All of a sudden , I started getting this scared feeling . So when he came out of the cigar store I thought what the hell , I 'll level with him . I said , " Winston , I do n't know why , but I 'm feeling kind of uptight . Is everything okay ? " He put hisp64arm on my shoulder and said , " My friend , it 's natural to be uptight in this city . Never trust anybody until you know them as well as you and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He went into this big rap about how careful you 've got to be . And Witch , I 've got to admit I really thought he was being straight with me . I kept on feeling scared , but I figured it was just my paranoia . So I followed him up this side street , I think it was 3rd or 4th , but I 'd never be able to find it again because my mind was kind of scrambled from being scared . He stopped in front of this cruddy-looking building , then he picked up a couple of stones and threwthem at a dark window on the third floor . I figured this wassome kind of a signal . After all , what do I know about dealingin Manhattan , right ? Then we went across the street and I followed him into this other tenement building that was just like the first one . I thought we 'd be going upstairs , but he passed the steps and led the way down this long hall to another door that opened on some shitty little back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd ever seen either . It stunk like hell and there was nothing growing in it . It was full of junk , old furniture , tom-up mattresses , broken glass , every kind of crap you can think of . And it was dark . The only light was whatever came out of these high windows all around . I told Winston I thought this yard was a pretty lousy place to wait , 1 but he said he 'd picked it especially so I could try the hash and nobody would smell the smoke . In a way that sounded reasonable , but in another way it did n't make any sense at all . My mouth got dry and I started shaking . Remember how it used to be when we 'd get caught for something at school and have to wait outside Miss Alley 's office ? Well , that 's how I felt . My heart was going so hard you could see my entire shirt moving . Finally I could n't stand it . I said , " Winston , I do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But by thetime I got to the door it was too late . Because there were two spade cats coining down the hall . I tried to get past themp65but they were in the way . One of them asked me where I was going . I said I had a friend waiting for me , and he said , " Oh , no , man , you do n't need a friend , " and the two of them hustled me into the yard again and shoved me against the wall . They had their knives out . One of them was at my throat . I could feel the blade pushing really hard against my skin , but it did n't cut me . Winston had his knife out too and it was pushing against my stomach . Then this third cat stood to one side and started giving orders . He told me to take off my shoes and all my clothes and throw them to him , one article at a time . He searched everything , even my T-shirt , like he thought I might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even ripped the linings out of my boots . Then the fucker took all my clothes except for my pants and threw them over this goddam high fence . All he found was the nineteen dollars because that 's all I had . So he flashed his knife in my face and asked me where the rest of it was . I was standing there stark naked and they 'd been through all my clothes , so it must have been pretty obvious I was n't holding out on them . But I guess Winston had given these guys the impression they were going to get a lot more than nineteen dollars , because they started having this argument . Then the other guy , the one that was holding the knife at my throat , said it was time to get out . So they started to leave . I said , " Hey , what about my pants ? " This one guy had them rolled up and tucked under his arm . But he did n't even answer me . The three of them just walked out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chase them with my butt hanging out . So I thought , Well , I guess I 'm fucked . And I tried to figure out how to get over the wall where the rest of my stuff was . Witch , it was really hell . I kept slipping and once I even fell . I do n't know on what , but I scraped my balls practically off . They still hurt in fact . Also , I cut my goddam knee . Anyway , I finally propped up this rickety old table with only three legs and made it over the fence , andp66there was this big-ass rat sniffing my boots . I swear , Witch , he was the size of a fucking Easter rabbit . Anyway , I must have scared him because he ran like hell . So I grabbed my jockeys and put them on and then I put on my T-shirt . But I knew I could n't make it over the fence in these combat boots , so I threw them over the fence ahead of me . This turned out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit , I realized this other building , the one I was in the yard of , had an unlocked door too , and I could have got out to the street again without climbing the fence . However , it 's a good thing I was stupid , because just as I got over the fence again and was tying my boots , Winston came back and gave me a joint . I could hardly believe it , Witch , but it 's true . I 've got the joint right here in this jacket . What happened was he just came walking back into the yard with this joint in his hand , holding it out to me . He said , " Here , mon . " At first I did n't want to take it , because I thought I ought to be too pissed off at him . But I was n't . I really was n't pissed off at all . In fact , I liked him . I still do . I figured he was just doing his thing . I mean , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thief does n't have to come back and give you a joint or anything , unless he happens to be a pretty decent cat in some ways . I do n't know , I 'm not saying I 'm right about this . I 'm just telling you all that went through my head . And for all I know , maybe I am right . After all , there is a goddam revolution going on , and these things can be very complicated to think about . So I took the joint . Not only that , I said thanks . Winstonstood there for a second , just looking at me , and I felt this kind of a sad little Zap coming out of his eyes . It was the first and only time he ever really looked at me straight on . Then he waved his hand around this crummy yard and he said , " This thing here , it 's nothing personal . " And then he left . If I 'd had a match , I 'd have smoked that joint right away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have saved half for you . But my mind was really messed up . I did n't know how Ip67was going to get back here in my jockeys , and there was nothing in that yard to cover up with . And I mean not a goddam thing . I got so panicky , I even tore apart this old window screen and tried to make a half-ass skirt out of it , but it looked like I 'd freaked out . Anyway , I held it in front of me and went through the hall and out to the street and looked around . I thought , What the hell am I going to do ? I was even tempted to find some cop , for godsake , so you can imagine how confused I was getting . I saw a garbage can at the curb , but there was nothing in it , so I tried to figure out how to hide behind the lid . All of a sudden , a woman 's voice came from out of nowhere . " Whatsa matter , kid ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a window , leaning there with her titties on a bed pillow . I tried to think up some lie . Force of habit , I guess . But I ended up telling her the truth . I said , " I been robbed , they took my pants . " She said , " How much did they get ? " I told her and she said , " The sonsabitches . " Then she said , " You look pretty cute . How you going to get home ? " I asked her if she could give me something to cover up with , so she told me to come inside . It was a typical poor person 's pad , like the slums you see on TV . She had her clothes hanging on a pole right there in the kitchen . I stood there and watched her go through it all . She pushed each hanger aside , one by one , and each time she said , " I ca n't give you this , " and " I ca n't give you this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , " I ca n't wear that for pants . " She said , " Sure you can . Just put your legs through the arms and wear it upside down . " I said , " It 'd look pretty weird , " and she said , " Aw , c'm on , you beatniks do n't mind lookin ' weird . It 's a new style . Try it . " Naturally it did n't work . I could n't even get my goddamfeet through . Then it finally dawned on me , this old broad was just having a good time for herself . She did n't give a shit what I did . So I said thanks for the jacket . Thenp68I tied it around my waist and split . On the street , I figured there was nothing to do but make a run for it . I looked pretty freaky , but at least I was covered up . I ran through Washington Square Park , and you know what ? Hardly anybodyeven noticed me . And the ones that did just kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ godsakelWhen Roy finished his story , we decided to look for a place to smoke Winston 's joint . It 's hard to find a hiding place in Manhattan . We ended up smoking it right on the street , trying to handle it like tobacco . Our heads were so hungry the first toke went right to work on us . By the time we 'd had three apiece we were flying , so we put it out and saved the other half for later . Then Roy did this angel-shit number on my head . We were on loth Street , headed for Third Avenue , when all of a sudden he stopped walking , stood stock still , banged his forehead with the heel of his hand and let out this zomegatonWOW ! I thought , Wow , that was quite a wow . This must be something major  --  and waited for him to subside enough to make an utterance . " Witch , " he said , " give me your hands . " I did . He took them in both of his . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What ? " I gasped . " I do n't know , but it will . Do you realize what we just smoked ? " " No . What was it ? " " Are you ready ? " " Yes . But give it to me fast . I 'm dying . " " Angel shit ! " " Angel shin ' "  | " We have just smoked angel shit . " " I never heard of it , what is it ? " " Any grass that 's given to you by a brother when you reallyneed it is angel shit . " " Really ? " " And when you 're high on it , something fantastic always happens to you . " I said , " How can this be angel shit if we got it from Win-ston ? " " Winston 's a brother , is n't he ? " " He 's not my brother , " I said . " Why not ? " " He just ripped you off , did n't he ? " " Yeah , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is ioo per cent typical of Roy . I remember one time we were down in his lair listening to music . The basement window was open and this strange alley cat came by and looked in . After a few minutes she jumped in and sniffed out the place while Roy and I laid there and watched . She got into everything he had and Roy just let her do as she pleased . Then she jumped up on a table and knocked over a glass . The glass rolled onto the floor and broke . The sound of the crash scared her , so she jumped out the window and ran away . I 'll never forget what Roy did . He sat up and said , " Hey , man , do n't split ! " And that 's the way he is . You can break right into his pad , go over his whole place , take anything you want , and on your way out he says , " Hey , man , do n't split ! " I 'm digressing . Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a brother , and it was n't hard . He just said , " Either we 're all brothers or we 're not . Which is it ? " And while I was thinking about that one , he threw in thep70clincher : " Besides , if love only came from perfect people , there would n't be any . Would there ? " I said , " Roy , how come you never told me about angel shit before ? " And he said , " Because I just made it up . " Then he laughed so hard he fell down . Literally fell down . Right on the sidewalk . Then I started laughing , and nearly fell on top of him . At this point , a police car came rolling by all lit up like a psychedelic rat . " Fuzz fuzz fuzz ! " I fuzzed . All mirth subsided abruptly . We pulled ourselves together and proceeded up loth Street , tightass as a couple of archbishops , and when the squad car turned the corner I said , " Roy , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angel shit ? " " Listen , " he said , " you think you 're pretty funny . Right ? Well I 'm going to tell you something . That shit was angel shit . The fact that I invented it does n't disqualify it , does it ? " " Of course not ! " " I mean , I can create magic , ca n't I ? I 'm a god . Am I a god or not ? " " You are , you are ! " I said . And I meant it . " Okay then , watch ! Something fantastic is going to happen to us tonight . Something fantastic and fabulous . In fact , it 'll be something absolutely **35;12480;TOOLONG ! " " Rip that off again , will you ? " " I can't. " *Try : , " **34;12517;TOOLONG ! " " **34;12553;TOOLONG ? " " Right . " " Love the McThwirp . " " " Thanks . Thought you would . "  | " This ought to be quite a night . " " It will be . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting at the Western Union office when we walked in , and greeted us with the biggest and beamingest smile I 've ever seen . Ever . And since this smile has changed our entire lives , I must describe in detail the celestial being who produced it . Sally Sunflower looks exactly like her name . Sometime when I feel like it , I 'll write the story of how she came to be called that . Sally 's hair is blond and naturally frizzy . If my mother got her hands on it , she 'd have it straightened in five minutes . But it 's perfect as it is . It picks up every light within miles and makes this enormous shimmering 3D halo around her entire face . And what a face ! It 's big and round and pink and gives the impression of smiling even when it is n't . She also laughs a lot , and her laughter is completely musical . In fact , her whole person is some sort of an instrument , a harpsichordmaybe . Whoever happens to be with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this tinkling babbling little song , just for them . What an awful paragraph ! I make Sally sound like a real gorp , all sticky-drippy with banana syrup oozing out of every opening she 's got . This is frustrating . You write the exact truth about someone you love , and out comes a completefalsehood . What can I say that would really capture her ? I suppose the Salliest thing to be said about her is that she 's so pleased about other people . For instance : she 's more pleased about me than I am even . That 's the way she seems to feel about everybody . She is genuinely , totally , deeplyp72enthralled and delighted and flipped-out over every last one of us . Although Roy and I had no way of knowing it at the time  --  and she 's much too modest to mention it herself  --  we 've since learned that Sally Sunflower is practically a historical figure . No one knows how many soldiers she 's talked into putting down their guns . At least two San Francisco cops quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's been busted seven times , and is generally fabulous in every conceivable way . Sally 's 22 ( a Virgo with the moon in Aquarius ) , so of course she was one of the first flower children , saw the summer of love at the Haight , marched at Century City , helped exorcise the Pentagon . But she was in the Movement even before 1967 . A close friend of Kerouac 's turned her on to grass when she was 14 . She had her first LSD in an electric cocktail on the Merry Pranksters ' bus . She helped the Hog Farm pass out food at Woodstock . When Abbie Hoffman sees her on the street , it 's Hi , Sally , Hi , Abbie , kiss-kiss . Ditto with Joe Frazier , Allen Ginsberg , Frank Zappa , Paul Krasner , and God knows who else . In fact , she 's known just about everywhere as one of the highestheads in all the tribes . Certainly she 's the highest chick I 've ever met . And living proof that a really high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And without money , too ! Sally 's been here seven months and one of her major sources of income is Western Union . Whenever she 's caught really short , she thinks of someone to send a telegramto and the money always comes . This time it was comingfrom her ex-grandmother in Las Vegas who makes barrels from gambling . I asked her if it bothered her to beg , and she said no , because it was n't begging . Then she explained : " Begging is a whole special trip and I 'm not into that . Ip73work for a living . I do embroidery . Right now I 'm making a blanket . Would you like to see it ? " She reached into her bag and showed us her work in progress , an old Army blanket she was transforming into a peace blanket by embroideringMAKE LOVE NOT WAR all over it with big psychedelic lettering . She started it a year ago , on the day a friend of hers went to prison for draft refusal . She figured it 'd be finished by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . I thought it was beautiful , but I did n't see how she could make her living by giving things away . " It 's easy , " she said . " I live on a post-revolutionary econ-omy . " Roy was fascinated . " What kind is that ? " " You do what you can for others , and when you need something for yourself , you ask for it . That 's all there is to it . " " And that 's post-revolutionary economy ? " I could see Roy filing it away in his head . " Right . My guru says that 's what the revolution is for , and the only way to bring it about is to live as if we 'd already won . Roy said , " He sounds like a very heavy dude . Is he a Marxist or a Christian or what ? " " Neither . All he believes in is consciousness . He says when people really know that all men are brothers , politics will disappear . We wo n't have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " My guru says we 're holy right now ! " I could n't resist sticking that in . " Oh , absolutely ! " Then I said , " Roy 's my guru . " " No , I 'm not , " he said . " We 're each other 's gurus . " " Far out ! " Sally sang . " That 's just what my guru says ! He says all the people that really know are gurus for each other . " I said , " Yes , but are n't some people more gurus thanp74others ? For instance , I know . But Roy really knows , and that 's how he can be my teacher . " " Roy said , " Come on , Witch . You really know , too . What are you talking about ? " " What about before ? Did n't you have to teach me to love Winston ? " Sally wanted to hear all about Winston , so Roy told her the story . Hearing it the second time through , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of a robbery . Sally was enraptured . She 's a good talker , but she 's even better at listening . And she does n't keep interrupting the way I do either . Her face is completely alive to what you 're saying , so you end up with the feeling that what you 're telling is wonderful and important and true . At the end of the story , the three of us went outside and did up the other half of Winston 's joint . Sally thought it was terrific . It was her first toke in three weeks , so her head was practically virgin . Roy asked her if she 'd been going without grass because of the famine , and that 's when Sally first mentioned this family she 'd joined up with . They were all dedicated to the natural high , trying to achieve it by the way they lived , in love and peace . She said none of them put down grass or acid , but they had this little non-rule they tried to follow : Use as little as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went back inside , the clerk said Sally 's money had arrived . She put the cash in her bag and sat down with us again , because Roy wanted to hear more about living on a post-revolutionary economy . That phrase really had hold of his mind . " What about the people you send wires to ? " he said . " Do they live on a post-revolutionary economy , too ? " " Maybe not all of them , " she said . " But I always assume they do . After all , you have to give people the benefit of the doubt . Especially if they 've got lots of money . Have n't youp75noticed how uncomfortable rich people are ? All the ones I 've known are always going around embarrassed or ashamed . They try to cover it up , but I think they must feel like real freaks . Do you suppose that 's why they keep to themselves so much ? So they wo n't have normal people staring at them ? " I said I had n't thought about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If you let people have a chance to help you , " Sally said , " it helps them get high . Have you noticed that ? " We said we had . " But of course , " she said , " you have to make it easy for them to refuse . For instance , you have to make it clear that you 'll go on liking them even if they say no . And one thing I never do , no matter what , is make up emergency stories . Some kids do that , you know , but I just  --  well , for me it 's wrong . Even if I was hungry I 'd rather go without food and call it a fast . Fasting can get you high , too . " I noticed Roy looking at me , and I got sort of defensive for a minute . " I 'll bet you 're thinking about that wire I sent Mother . " Roy 's lip pulled to one side and his eyebrow went up . I said , " Sally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . " " So do I , " Roy said . " We both do . " " Does that make you hate us ? " I asked Sally . She looked stricken . " Oh , Witch ! Do n't say such things ! Nothing could ever make me hate either of you ! You 're both angels , do n't you know that ? " Roy smiled . " I would n't say we lie a lot . And when we do , it 's only to the Establishment . " He looked at me . " Would n't you say that was true ? " " Definitely . " Roy wondered what Sally thought about that . She said , " It must be okay for you , because otherwise how could you be so beautiful ? "  | " No , but really , " he said , " do n't you think a person has to ? " " Look , " she said , " if you live as if the revolution 's already over , then there is n't any Establishment , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Roy said , " Yes , but what about banks and insurance companiesand parents and armies and things like that ? " Roy loves hypothetical discussions . One of his favorite subjects is morality . " That 's very tough , " Sally said . " I suppose if you were in the Army and had to lie to get out of killing someone , then you 'd just have to go ahead and lie . But of course that 's an exceptional situation , because there it 's like you 're dealingwith real maniacs . " " The Army ? " " Sure ! Oh , I do n't mean every soldier is a maniac , far from it . But the ones that go around ordering the men to kill against their will  --  what 's that ? Is n't that what maniacs are supposed to do ? " " Right , " Roy said . " So there 's a situation where it 's justifiableto lie . " " " That 's silly , though , is n't it ? " Sally said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We know better . " " Yeah . " Roy glanced at me . " We do know better . " Then he said to Sally , " What would you do if you were a man ? Would you lie to stay out ? " " If I were a man , " Sally said , " I 'd tell the truth to stay out . " " And go to prison ? " " Hm-mm , not me . I 'd go to Canada and marry the Prime Minister . Is n't he heaven ? No , seriously , I think it 'd be easier to get used to the cold than go to prison . So I 'd go to Canada . " " And give up your citizenship ? " Sally shrugged and smiled . " Sure . What about you ? " " Well , " he said , " I guess I 'd go underground . "  |p77I  said , " Tell her , Roy . " Roy looked around the Western Union office . There was no one there but the clerk , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sally , listen , we 're underground . " Sally breathed a long , deeply impressed 000000h ! Then she said , " Now everything is beginning to fall into place . I 'd planned to come down here in the morning , but I came tonightinstead . Now I know why . Oh , this is so spooky ! Did you notice me looking at you when you came in here tonight ? " We said we had . " Well , " she said , " that 's because I picked up on both of you before you even walked in the door . Truly . I got distinct angel vibes just seeing you through the window . " " Fantastic , " I said . " Far out ! " Roy said . Sally 's very persuasive . We both ended up agreeing with her . Without much struggle either . Let 's face it , it 's true . Roy and I are angels . If we happen to fuck up once in a while , what does that prove ? Sally was shimmering and glittering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hands , " she said . Roy and I each took one of her hands in ours , and we formed a little circle . When Sally noticed the Western Union man leaning on the counter watching us , she said , " Do you want to join the circle , too ? " He hesitated . You could tell he dug the idea . But he said no , thanks , he guessed he better not , and he went back to work . Then Sally said , " Okay , let 's close our eyes together . " We closed our eyes and sat in silence for a minute . " I see this fabulous light , do n't you ? " she said . I had n't , but I began to , and it seemed to grow stronger . Roy said he saw it , too.  |p78Sally  said , " You know what that light is ? " Roy said , " I 'm not sure . What is it ? " " That 's us . And it 's especially strong because there 's three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said wow . Sally said , " Think how it will be when the whole world 's together ! " Then the light in our heads went Zap ! and multiplied about a hundred times , exploding in all sorts of forms and colors . And while our eyes were still closed and our inner eyes were still getting this real acid-style light show , Sally Sunflowersaid , " I hope you 'll come home with me and join our family . " That did it . I fell apart . Tears . The works . It was n't just me either . They had wet eyes , too . The clerk came over to the counter at about this point to tell us my money order had come  --  $150 and a message . DEAR GLORIA BUSES ARE NASTY TAKE A PLANE ALL IS FORGIVEN WE LOVE YOU MOTHER AND DADI started to have a big guilt flash , but I decided to put it off till later . So I composed a message for her . DEAR MOTHER THANKS FOR MONEY PLANS CHANGED LETTER FOLLOWSIt sounded pretty naked but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I just added LOVE AND PEACE GLORIA andsent it . The Canal Street neighborhood is spooky at night . You have to walk through a couple of miles of dark warehousey streets to get to it.  |p79We  talked all the way . Sally filled us in on the family . The head of it , even though she said there was n't one , was obviously Peter Friedman , this guru she 'd mentioned . He used to be a psychoanalyst ( Sagittarius ) but he dropped out ( Super-Sagittarius ) in 1967 . One of his lady patients , a fancy Hollywood talent agent named Doris , dropped out at the same time and came east to live with him . They took the top three floors of this four-story building about a block from the river . He was n't rich but he still had some money left . So did Doris . Besides , the place was old and run down and not very expensive . For a while it was just Peter and Doris . Then one day their Yoga teacher got evicted from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of them were marching on Washington that fall , they met a cab driver . The four of them more or less fell in love , so he moved in , too . And that 's the way it happened , and kept happening until pretty soon there were nine . All the way over to Canal Street , Roy and I were stopping to pinch ourselves . I 'd say , Do you believe what is happening to us ? And he 'd say , No , do you ? I 'd say , No , and we 'd both say , Wow . The prospect of having a place to live , Sally Sunflower for a friend , and a super-high guru like Peter Friedman thrown in on top of it all was almost more than either of us could handle . As we climbed the stairs we heard " Hare Krishna " playing on the stereo , the same Swami Bhaktivedanta recording Roy and I used to groove on in Belle Woods . Even though everything else was strange to us , this chanting gave us a feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , we knew we were home . We were greeted by four people we 'd never seen before , three guys and a chick , but each one of them was as familiar to us as our own faces . Sally introducedp80us as new members of the family and the next thing we knew we were sitting in a circle holding hands with our new brothers and sisters , being accepted without a word of questioning . Then they told Sally what had happened that evening . Peter had received a call from California telling him his father was dying . So he and Doris were on their way to California . I was too lost in wonder and amazement to listen very carefully to all that was said . I remember looking around the room a lot . The place itself was ordinary , but the overall effect was magical . There was an altar on one wall  --  just a little table , really , with a wooden Buddha on it , a candle and some incense . Around Buddha 's neck someone had hung a big gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a long narrow table at one end of the room . It reminded me of the last supper . I guess for Roy and me it was the highest night of our lives to date . Even after the angel shit wore off , the night got higher and higher and higher ! Roy was in a state of utter flabbergastation . Mouth open , eyes blinking . He looked as if he 'd just wandered into paradiseand found it even finer than its reputation . All the while the others were talking , the two of us kept looking at their beautiful faces , and then we 'd look at each other and say wow over and over again . MidnightThe previous entry was written in about a dozen different sittings . I have n't yet found a quiet place to work around here . Tomorrow I want to write brief sketches of every member of the family , but I think I 'm in real danger of becoming a writing freak . It 's so hard to decide what to includep81and what to eliminate . Everything that happens around here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real gas . ( Not because of my cooking either . Everyone said it was good , but I 'm not so sure . I think the rice was too soggy and Sally 's the one who actually baked the fish . But that does n't matter . I 'll learn . ) When we sit down to eat , we hold hands around the table , close our eyes , and send Zaps to faraway brothers . We start with Will , the one in Pennsylvania who 's serving out his sentence for draft refusal . Then , if you want to Zap someone else , all you have to do is say his name and everyone in the family chips in his voltage to help you do it . But that 's enough , goddam it . I 'm tired ! 1:10 a.m . I ca n't sleep . I 'm wondering where my father is. 2:30 a.m . Still ca n't sleep . Neither can Roy . We 're in our cave under the attic stairs . He 's lying next to me with his eyes closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach to keep us feeling connected . We 've just had a very realistic talk and decided we 've both been flying a little too high in certain ways , and had better be careful of crashing . I do n't know how either of us could be so naive as to think we could move into a perfect stranger 's house while he 's away and actually expect him to come back and be delightedabout our being here . Obviously he 's in the habit of taking people in , because there are all these others here . But did they move in while he was away ? Did n't he have some say in the matter ?  |p82Earlier  , I asked Sally Sunflower if she did n't think there was some chance Peter would be annoyed about our moving in on him like this . Her answer , even though I love her to pieces , made me feel she might be just a tiny bit manic . She said , " Peter trusts me . He knows I have good judgment . " Smiling like mad , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but what about Doris ? " " Doris trusts me , too . " " But Sally , they 've never even seen us . And we 've moved into their house , bag and baggage . " " " I know , " she said . " Is n't it groovy ? " Then she hugged me and went off to some meeting . ( Theosophy , I think . ) Roy said he never had believed our good luck was necessarilypermanent . I asked him what gave him his first inkling of doubt . He said it was that first night on the street when Sally mentionedPeter had been an analyst . Because of his father , all these alarms started ringing in his head . Then for a while he got carried away meeting all these new people . But before we went to bed , when I suggested he put up the Desiderataposter , he only went along with the idea because he did n't want to bring me down . But he did n't push the tacks all the way in . He asked me what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Sally . She sounded a little bit fanatical on the subject of Peter , and that made me feel he must have some really fabulous flaws that she 'd failed to pick up on . Anyway , I feel better now , because Roy and I are back to earth . We both realize our fates are far from sealed . We 've got ourselves set up now so we can pack our things and be out of here in 6o seconds flat . The $15o from Mother is a nice cushion , but we 've decided to put part of it in the Grocery Pig . The Grocery Pig is part of the post-revolutionary econ/omy . The family has this ceramic gravy boat in the shape of a pig , and everybody chips in for household expenses . Tomorrow we 're going to do something about getting jobs.  |p84CANAL  STREET , MONDAY , SEPTEMBER 8 , 1969I 'm sitting on an upside-down bucket in the most wonderfuloffice in the world . It 's a greenhouse on the roof . Will built it before he went to prison . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to family legend , his thumb is so green all he has to do is lean on an old man 's cane and it takes root right before your eyes . He even grows things you 're not supposed to be able to grow at all , except in the tropics . For instance , at this very second I am looking at a hibiscus plant , a live one . Nobody else can get it to bloom , but Will can  --  even in winter ! All the plants have tags onthem . Dracaenea . Dieflenbachia . Sche f alerea . Andonidea . Banana . ( Banana ! ) I 'm learning to call each of them by name . Will told Cary Colorado ( he 's our Yoga teacher ) this can be an enormous help when you 're trying to get blooms from them . Talking to them by name lets them know your interest in them is more than just casual and they turn themselves inside out trying to please you . Everything I 've heard about Will makes me like him.  |p85There  's a photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all in shadow , but you can see he 's fantastically tall and his shoulders are just enormous . One of these days I 'll write to him and thank him for the use of this groovy office . Also , I just discovered that the alcove where Roy and I sleep used to be Will 's , too . I wonder what his birth sign is ? I hope he 's an Aries . Today I found out classes begin at City College on the 15th . When I hung up the phone I started trembling . Why ? I 've been dreaming about my father for the last two nights . In one dream we were married and living in a foreign country . But it did n't seem foreign , it just was . Everything pure white and mysterious , and then the whole thing turned inside out and became murky . I think I changed into my mother or something . Sally says she 'll show me how to get to City College on the subway . Mrs. Gretzinger in Senior English told me I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it until I could do it with authority . I have a fantastic idea for a novel and I could really do it , too . There 's this young girl in Elmhurst , Illinois , or Wild Earth , Kansas , or wherever I decide to put her . She knows Where It 's At because she reads constantly . Time , Look , Playboy , Newsweek , Rolling Stone , EVO , Screw , everything she can get her hands on . But she has n't had a chance yet to try her hip little wings in a real center of action . So the book starts with her arrival in New York . I 'll use some of my own actual experiences . Roy 's too . I 'll have her get robbed and beaten up , put in beaucoups sex , plus I 'll have her fall in with a gang of smackheads who tryp86to turn her on to heroin , etc . A thing like this could really sell like acid at a festival and I could make a fortune . The girl ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virgin head , so if she does n't have her first big sex thing in the book at least she 'll have her first acid trip . Then in the movie version there can be all these psychedelic effects . Better yet , why do n't I give her a virgin body and head and she can lose both cherries at once in a fantastic climactic scene ? I hate it . I really do . I really hate it . I 'm so sick of all this virginity bullshit . I 've never been a virgin and I do n't know anyone who ever was . I think virginity must have been invented by dirty old men so they 'd have something to defile . What else is it good for ? Anyway , women have been hassled enough about it , and I 'm certainly not going to write an entire book that 'll do nothing but foster a lot of phoniness . Only why is it every time I come up with a really sensational idea for a novel , it 's always got to be so disgusting I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journal . When we got here Friday night there were four members of the Canal Street family missing . Peter and Doris  --  and Will , of course . The fourth was away somewhere for the weekend , but I met him this morning . Archie Fiesta . My stupid hand lingers over the letters as I write his name . I loathe being in love . ( Loving is great . Being in love sucks . ) Archie 's a Virgo with a moon in Leo and Aquarius rising , which means I 've had it . Poor Roy , being Pisces like me , is having the same problem . Except that he seems to be diggingit and I 'm not . I suppose that 's because he 's got Virgo rising and Virgo men seem to love trouble . For instance , Archie took him out this afternoon to show him the town , and Roy floated off like a bubble.  |p87Archie  Fiesta is the first .. . I do n't want to think about Archie now . If I do , I wo n't feel like writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . Neyeurme is a cab driver . He 's probably about 30 , but he looks like a big schoolboy . His skin is very dark and he has Afro hair . He 's always reading and I get the impression he 's a heavy thinker . His answers to even the most casual questionsare pondered so carefully that after a while you begin to wonder if it was cool to place such a burden on his head . He has a big troubled forehead with a few hickeys on it , and I keep imagining there 's some connection between the hickeys and all this heavy thinking . He 's a double Gemini , which ca n't be too much fun . His name is a bitch to pronounce . The ghost of some archbishop appeared to him while he was tripping one night and laid it on him . This ghost is the only other person besides Neyeurme who can say it correctly because it has all these diphthongy tonguestranglingnuances to it . But it 's his soul 's name , so all his friends try terribly hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nyoom . Cary Colorado comes from Boulder . He used to be part of a very high commune there , before it got squeezed out by the local Establishment . His mother named him Cary because she was hung up on Cary Grant . But he does n't look like a movie star . He looks like an ape . In fact , he 's any girl 's dream of what an ape would be if apes were really groovy and not too covered up with body hair . He has this compact little jungle-style body , too , probably from doing Yoga . He 's known in the family as the Meditator , because his thing isp88putting out these blockbuster vibes . He 's an Aquarius with Aries rising , and when you sit in a circle with him , it 's sort of like being electrocuted with love . He 's 22 and he 's spent the last three years learning secrets for getting high without dope . He teaches Yoga for a living and he 's happy all the time ! But what delights me most of all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything about him , from his pie-face smile right down to his longer than normal arms , strikes me as simian-groovy . Jeanette has perfect brown skin and her hair is the greatestAfro I 've ever seen , an enormous mat-black living turban . The chick herself is as real as her hair . She 's a Cancer , but a truly evolved Cancer with a moon in Capricorn .

She works at home and she 's so good at it , it only takes her a couple of mornings a week . Her best language is French , but the language of her life is pure black . Not Pearl Bailey either . Even better . Simpler . More peaceful . Not so ego-trippy . This morning she and I were talking about this fabulous education of hers and she said , " That 's all a bunch of shit , Witch . What I dig most is keeping things straight . " I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , drawers , cupboards , closets . My head , too . I just like to keep it all straight . " She 's got Peter 's books all catalogued and the entire family record collection is in perfect order . She also likes sewing and beading , and Sally 's teaching her embroidery . If I 'm going to do this thing right , I 'd better describe Percy the Cat . Even though technically he does n't belongp89to our family , he 's always here . His owner is an Italian lady named Mrs. Goldoni , who lives next door , but she only sees Percy at mealtime . He comes and goes through the window next to the fire escape . Percy is black , actually a kind of sable color , and he moves like a tamed panther who 's gotten fat and lazy from living in captivity . Also , the jewels have been removed from his poor little scrotum and this must have something to do with his total lack of feline initiative . He 's an ankle cat . He 's always rubbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose any definitive portrait of Percy has to include some reference to his flatulence . It 's absolutely radical . He farts every time you pick him up and hold him . And his brand is special . They do n't just rise up and blow away , they have staying power . Even when the room is full of patchouli and frankincense , Percy 's farts hang in the air like lead clouds . The only other living being in this house is a ghost . Nobody'sactually seen it but everybody 's convinced it 's here and it seems to be located in the hall outside the Big Room . Sally described it as a column of cool air , and often when she passes by it she has the feeling it 's alive . Nyoom has had the same experience and so has his girl friend , Mary . No one seems to mind . They 've just gotten used to the idea of sharingthe place with this invisible tenant . Ever since I heard about it , I pause in the hall when I pass , hoping to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to bed I actually felt something . My head 's too programmed now to be objective , but I had the feeling there was this gentle little pocket of lonesomeness there , and it made me vaguely sad . When I got to bed , I told Roy about It . He said , " Did you say good night to it ? " I had n't . So I got up and stood at the head of the stairs and smiled down into the dark . Nothingp90seemed to be smiling back up at me , but I flashed a peace sign and said good night , just in case , and went back to bed . Nyoom brought his woman to dinner . Her name is Mary something . She 's a super-blond ex-wAsr and he 's jet black , so they look great together , very Yin and Yang . Also they 're opposites in other ways . Nyoom loves to hold forth and Mary loves to listen . They seem to be a perfect couple in every conceivable way . ( I 'll bet they 're fantastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nyoom either . She gets it right , pronouncing every little nuance of his soul 's name exactly the way he does , Neyeurme . She teaches bookkeeping at a high school in Brooklyn . You can tell she 's intelligent by the questions she asks  --  but she never pushes herself forward in a discussion . You always have the impression she 's sitting at Nyoom 's feet , encouraging him to be brilliant . Furthermore , it works . He was so brilliant tonight explaining the Black Panthers , the entire table was spellbound . He says they 're actually engaged in Street Theater and their most powerful weapon is the TV camera . The plot of the play is to force the white power structure out into the open so the whole world can see the tactics it uses to hold the black man down . Nyoom feels he knows exactly what 's going to happen in the world during the rest of the century . He 's got an entire timetable in his head . At first it sounded too fantastic , but I noticed Roy listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes like this : Between now and 1972 , we catch the government in more and more lies , most of them just as shitty as Vietnam . For instance , all the secret wars like Laos and Cambodia get exposed . Demonstrations . Counterdemonstrations . Peoplep91beat each other up right in the streets . Much bombing . Crime rate zooms , everybody ripping off everybody else . Schools close down . Rich ladies hire armed guards to take them to the delicatessen . The whole country becomes as dangerous as the ghettos have been for years . Chaos up to here . Nixon and Agnew lay the whole thing on the students , the blacks , the peace movement , etc . The cops get caught on TV gunning down the leaders of radical movements . Word leaks out that shoot-to-kill orders have come from Very High Up . This causes mass public freak-out . ( Nyoom called it " cultural shock , " but Roy translated . ) Scads of government employees all over the country split their posts in disgust . Nobody buys a single word uttered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " ( Roy 's translation : " Nobody left to do the dirty work . " ) So the police and the Army move in . Nyoom says they already run the whole thing secretly , but by 1972 they quit pretending . They just move right into the old White House , guns and all , and declare a national emergency for themselves . Half of the public thinks this is just divine , but the other half does n't dig it at all . Civil war starts . Naturally , the generals cream . They 've been revving up for this for years , and they know perfectly well the poor revolutionaries have n't got it together at all . Instantslaughter , quick roundup of dangerous types ( like us ! ) , and the whole thing 's over . Very short war . Then the New Dark Age begins . Martial law . Armored tanks in the streets . Curfews everywhere from Sutton Place to Gung Ho , Texas . Old ladies out looking for their cats after dark found shot to death in the A.M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be heard from again . Super uglies for breakfast , lunch , and dinner . Informing . Sabotage . Reprisals . Meanwhile , the rest of the world 's gettingit together for a change . Because the Pentagon 's too busy making fascism work at home to do much exporting . America is finally isolated by its own bullshit , and Thirdp92World forces have to move in to liberate us . Do they get to us before the looneys push the button ? Nyoom says it 's touch and go , because the whole system 's rigged for self-destruct . Later , in bedRoy earned $3 today . There 's a sign painter on the street floor of this house , and Roy made a delivery for him . It 's the first money he 's ever earned and he 's practically hysterical with pride . I did n't do much about getting work myself . Spent most of the afternoon with Sally at the launderette . She taught me how to run the machines . They 're easy . All we had to do was fold things . And talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . And she hardly ever smokes ! Peter called from California while we were having dinner tonight . His father has n't died yet . Nyoom happened to be the one to answer the phone . When I found out it was Peter , I told him to say something about Roy and me , and to askif it was all right if we stayed till he got back . But Nyoomca n't do anything simply . He said , " The population of this Canal Street ExperimentalStation en route to Utopia has increased by two examplesof the genus homo sapiens , and , er , uh , the , uh , foundlings in question are indulging in a certain shall we say anxiety as to their status here . However , Sally Sunflower , that stunning example of celestial flora , has done what she could to assure them that the matter . . . " And blah blah blah . Peter must be a saint to let him run on like that long distance . Anyway , I guess it 's cool for us to stay till he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been into a writing thing for three solid days , so it feels good to have this notebook in my lap again . It 's been raining all day . Cary Colorado 's out looking for wood . He wants to build a fire and do his Yoga in front of it . It 's not at all cold , but it 'll be lovely to see the fireplace working . Percy the Cat is curled up at my feet and the whole scene is so old-timey and cozy I 'm having Emily Bronte flashes . Sally Sunflower is Charlotting in the kitchen . It 's her day to cook . On my days she 's always out there showing me macrobioticsecrets , but on her days she does n't seem to mind doing it all alone . Peter and Doris are still in California . They phoned last night to get in on the mealtime Zap . Peter 's father is lingeringon and on without showing any signs of getting better or worse . I caught myself hoping he 'd die , so Peter and Doris could come back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myselfbeing so selfish because I knew it was only a flash and entirely human . Roy 's upstairs helping Jeanette clean out Peter 's attic.  |p94They  want to have it all painted and spruced up as a surprise for when he gets back . I 've never seen Roy work so hard . The sign man downstairs has n't had any more deliveries for him to make , but since that first $3 , he 's been obsessed with the idea of paying his own way . He volunteered to help Jeanette do over the attic , and the notion of repainting it was entirely his . It 's strange . On the one hand , he wo n't even push the thumb tacks all the way in on our Desiderata poster , and yet he 's painting the attic of a man he has n't even met . I suppose he 's trying to build up a little insurance against getting thrown out when Peter comes back . Also , I notice he digs being with Jeanette . It seems like whenever he 's not with Archie Fiesta , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing him . The only time I see him is at dinner and in bed . The attic is my favorite part of the house . The stairs right above the alcove where Roy and I sleep open into this sort of loft that Peter uses for talking with people in private . I suppose it 's actually his consultation room . The only furniture in it is an Oriental rug , two easy chairs and a mattress . Off to the side there 's a little blue Buddha , some votive candles , and an incense burner , all on the floor . Also little stacks of books here and there and scads of newspapers and magazines , both underground and overground . On one wall is a bulletin board with a little of everything on it . You could stand there for hours ( and I have ) finding new bits and pieces that various members of the family and other visiting brothers and sisters have tacked up . Some are original and some are copied from other sources . I 'll copy the whole bulletinboard in here someday when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment I want to get the titles of these books.  |p95Peter  's BooksThe Autobiography of Malcolm XThe Politics of Ecstasy .

The sign man has his shop down there , and we have the top three floors . Our first ( which is actually the second floor of the building ) has three rooms . The one I 'm in now is called the Big Room . Practically everything happenshere  --  living , eating , listening to music , etc . Then there 's the kitchen at the back , and off to the side a tiny bedroom where Sally Sunflower sleeps . The second floor is nothing but two enormous bedrooms and a big bathroom in between plus the little cave under the attic stairs where Roy and I sleep . And that 's it . Except that in the attic there 's also a bedroom where Doris and Peter sleep . The style of the house is groovy ramshackle . Everything 's either falling apart from age or on the verge . The toilet , for instance , has to be flushed by drawing a bucket of water from the tub and dumping it into the bowl . Nobody minds any of this because the rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that we agree not to ask the landlord for anything , no matter what , even if the roof falls in . But we can do anything we please , even build greenhouses on the roof , as long as we do n't bug him . Why am I writing all this stuff ? I seem to be in a Jeanette mood today , sorting out little drawers in my head , telling where everybody is , describing the house , etc . I 'm avoiding something of course . And I know exactly what it is , too . I 've been noticingp97lately that the minute I ask myself a question like this , the answer 's sitting right there staring at me . Hi , Archie , you prick . I might as well go whole hog and start from the beginning . The first time I saw him , the morning after Roy and I moved in , he was sitting here on this very couch listening to a Steve Miller record , the one that starts with " Quicksilver Girl , " a song I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awake yet , but when Sally introduced us , I nearly fell over in a dead faint , he 's that beautiful . Puerto Rican and Italian with a little German thrown in , and the combination is utter pornography . His handshake alone is an aphrodisiac . And no woman should look at him head-on without sunglasses unless she wants to run the risk of making a fool of herself on the spot . Witch Pisces Me wanted to jump right into his lap , but somehow Witch moon-in-Scorpio Me has been able to maintain a certain cool  --  until this afternoon . Now I 'm wondering how badly I blew it . I have some secret thoughts about Archie Fiesta that I would n't divulge to a living soul , not even Roy . The thought of causing even a hint of dissension in this perfect , sacred family destroys me completely . Besides , Roy has taught me to dig the Eighth Commandment . Rather than break it , I 'd undergo an abortion without sedation by a doctor using ice tongs . But I 'm not called Witch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I trust them . They are whispered into my ears by angels or something probably . Who knows ? But everything I am tells me Archie Fiesta is on a death trip . Furthermore , he wants company ! God , what a horrible thing to write down . The really awful thing is that he 's so excruciatingly attractive . And not just to me . He 's got this entire family in a bag slung over his shoulder and just walks away with us in any direction he chooses . So great for instance are thep98prerogatives of beauty that he takes money out of the GroceryPig while everybody else is putting it in  --  and no one seems to mind in the least . I ca n't help thinking if he really wanted us to live in peace , he 'd mess himself up a little so we could all stop quivering about him . His hair is the reddish black Grandmother O'Malley used to try for with her henna packs , only on Archie it 's real . His skin is even more translucentthan mine , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . But it would n't help  --  it 's his whole head and bod . He looks as if somebody had hired the top 25 greatest sculptors and painters of all time and said , Go to it , the sky 's the limit  --  and what they came up with is Archie Fiesta . But I still ca n't forget his lips . They 're curly and a little too big , and the skin on them is so thin you can see right through to the red , which is the red of ripe strawberry with the faintest hint of beige at the edges . And now , having lingered on them for a full minute , I 'm ready to faint again . I hereby instructmyself to stop thinking about Archie Fiesta 's lips . I must steel myself and proceed to his eyes . One of them moves straight into yours when he looks at you , but has a slight cast and seems somehow to be off on a hip of its own . The total effect is that Archie Fiesta is half here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You get the impression he 's remembering life on some other planet , or this chick he left back on Mars . Along with all these radical physical assets , what really undoes people is his cool and his rap . He claims his cool comes from harmony , inner harmony . And that , in a nutshell , just about sums up his rap . The first time you hear it , it sounds pretty good , but the second time it rings hollow . It 's like he got hold of this magic code word , Harmony , and because he 's so cool ( stoned out of his mind is my guess  --  I 'll bet my ass he munches mescalinefor breakfast ! ) and so wildly good-looking , everybody seems to want to believe it . I wonder if Peter does ?  |p99Could  I be wrong ? Could it be just this mad physical impactof his that makes me feel he 's simply got to be a con man ? Scorpios are often suspicious of the people they want to go to bed with . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account . So why does that left eye of his keep bugging me ? It 's like the rest of his face and his body were with you completely , but this one part of him is keeping an eye on the boss . And the boss is Satan . I 've just read this over . I disgust myself . I do n't believe a word I 've written . Now shut up , Witch , and copy the Desiderata . I order you to do it beautifully , in your best handwriting : DESIDERATAGo placidly amid the noise and the haste . And remember what peace there may be in silence . As far as possible withoutsurrender , be on good terms with all persons . Speak your truth .. . This is ridiculous . I just realized I 'm still on my mother 's old Catholic guilt trip , doing penance for having ugly thoughts . I refuse to defile the Desiderata by copying it down as a punishment . I 'll wait and do it when the perfect moment arrives for it and not a second before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened between Archie and me a few minutes ago . But now that I think about it , it 's not so horrible . There 've been all these glances passing between us ever since that first night . As a rule , when one of us gets caught at it , the other smiles , and nothing ever gets said . But today it was different . I came down and found him here stringing his guitar , and like a fool I said , Oh excuse me , and started out of the room . But then he called me back and asked me why I excused myself.  | " I do n't know . Maybe because you 're working . I do n't really know . " " Have you got something else to do ? " " Nothing urgent . I was just bringing my notebook up to date . " " Why not do it here ? " I said I did n't know why not . And then I looked at him , really looked at him to see if I could find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling in a knowing way , and I got the feeling he knew I was attracted to him and was teasing me about it . I said , " Archie , you look like you 're amused about something . Am I right ? " " I do n't know . Do I look amused ? Maybe I am " " Yes , maybe you are . I always feel you 're teasing me . " " Teasing ? " His right eye and his entire face found the idea incredible  --  but his left eye went right on doing its little number on my head . I got annoyed . But I did n't let it creep into my voice . I spoke reasonably . " Yes , Archie . Teasing . And I do n't dig that , because I 'm not into games . " " Games ? You think I 'm into games ? Listen , my rap is har-mony . " " I know , " I said . " I 've heard your rap . It 's very beautiful . " I said it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy it ? " I just looked at him . His whole face was working together at putting out this big sincerity blast . Then Cary Colorado came into the room with his arms full of kindling and started to build the fire . He must have picked up on the voltage we were putting out , because without even looking at either of us , he asked us to make a circle with him . Archie had my left hand , and he squeezed it in a way that made me feel he was begging me to believe him . My right hand was in Cary 's , so naturally I was getting these really powerhousep101vibes . Between the two of them , my mind turned to mush and everything got simple again . I loved them both and they loved me . Pretty soon we were all smiling at each other and feeling this invisible white sweetness passing through us . I said , " Archie , was I hassling you before , when Cary came in ? " Archie said , " No , I did n't feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an adorable little ape and said , " Look , Ma , no hassles , " which made us laugh again . So we broke the circle , and Cary started his Yoga . Archie said he had to go out and would I walk him down to the street . I said sure . And when we got down there , he said , " Listen , Witch , if you should happen to feel like getting in bed with me some night , just crawl in . " Thank heaven he was n't looking at me , because I was wrecked . Of course , being a large phony , I was careful not to betray myself . I said something breezy like " Fantastic idea , Archie , " and ran upstairs . But why did I get so angry ? It seems to me now that under the circumstances this was a very cool thing for him to say . He looks like a god ; can he help it ? He sees this chick obviouslyfreaked out over him and he invites her into his bed  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ? Wedding rings , annuities , promises ? It 's absurd . I 'm the one that 's off base in this entire matter . Thank heaven I have a notebook for this drivel so I can keep my head free of it . ( But I still do n't trust A.F. ! )  |p102CANAL  STREET , SEPTEMBER 12 , 1969ROY SPENDS THE DAY IN TAE BRONXas told to Witch GlizI get this job through an ad . It 's selling children 's books door to door . I despise the idea of selling , but I decide to try it because I figure they probably wo n't ask for identification . On the first day , we drive up to the Bronx in the boss 's car . There 's myself , a black dude named Bristol , who was also a beginner , and this really tough black chick named Harriet , who 's supposed to show us what to do . I 'm the only one with a license , so I do the driving . The day goes along okay . Nobody wants to hear about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them is go away and leave them alone . I get hollered at a few times but it 's not terrible . Anyway , at the end of the day , Bristol and myself are sitting in the car in front of some apartment building , waiting for Harriet to come out . Across the street there 's an elementary school . Otherwise it 's just a regular neighborhood . All of a sudden the car door opens and I 'm being told top103get out . Then I see the door on Bristol 's side is being opened and somebody 's telling him to get out , too . It 's a pair of plainclothesmen . They show us a badge , shove us up against the car and search us . One of them , a fat-faced guy with little pink eyes , starts questioning us . What are we doing up here ? I tell him , but he says I 'm a fucking liar . That 's his favorite word , he uses it about a hundred times . I show him all the stuff in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the order forms . And that 's when it starts getting creepy . Because at this point they believe us . I can tell they do , and yet they keep on pretending not to . They ask if we have police records . I say no . Bristol says , yes , for possession and assault . So what do they do ? They leave Bristol alone in the car  --  unguarded  --  and they take me , the cat that does n't have a record , into this apartment building . The pink-eyed one says , " Come in here and talk . It 's cold outside . " And they get me in there by the mailboxes and tell me to take off my sweater . I ask them what they 're after , and the guy says , " We want to see if you 've got tits and a pussy along with all that pretty hair . " Up to this point I 'm being cooperative , because I 'm afraid if they take me in they 'll find out about my thing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because they start throwing me around and pushing me against walls and slapping me in the face . So I tell them I 've got a right to know what 's happening . Then the one that 's been silent up to now says , " You 're selling heroin to school kids and we know it . Look at you , tracks all over your arm . " All the while I 'm trying to figure out what they 're talking about because my arms have n't got a mark on them and they know it . Then he shows me his fist and he says , " If I shove that in your face will you tell the truth ? " Then the fat-faced one pulls out a razor , an actual goddam razor , and he says , " I 'll bet he jerks off fifth-grade kids . Is that what you do , you filthy little motherfucker ? " He grabs hold of my hair andp104asks me if I 'd like a haircut . But the other guy says , " No , do n't cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to when he goes down on us . " Just then the inside door opens , and it 's Harriet , on her way out of the building . She sizes up the situationpretty fast , and she 's not scared of these guys either . She says , " What 's the matter , Roy ? " Suddenly the silent one gets very dignified . " You know this person ? " he says . Harrietlooks him right in the eye " Yes , I do , " she says . Then he shows her his badge . " Narcotics squad . Routine check . " And he turns to me . " Okay , you can go . " Then they give me my sweater back , and we split . On the way back downtown , Harriet says to me , " How do you like bein ' a nigger ? " I tell her I do n't care for it . And when we get back to the office , I get fired for not coming up with any prospective buyers for the books.  |p105MONDAY  , SEPTEMBER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm wrecked . My mind wo n't stop . It 's been leading me around by the nose all day long and I 'm not going to let it get away with any more shit . The Desiderata says , " Beyond a wholesome discipline , be gentle with yourself . " I have n't been gentle , I 've been indulgent . I 've been compulsiveand foolish and reckless , and I 've followed every single whim as if it were a command , and what 's worse , my darling little mind has been justifying each disastrous step , one after another . The Mothers of Invention say the mind is the ugliest part of the body . Well , mine is in for a face lift . Or at least a good purge . I 'm going to sit here at this table until I 've written everything that 's happened today , and when I get done , if my mind has n't had enough , I 'll just keep writing until it faints from sheer exhaustion . YesterdayI was so full of clarity and purpose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saint . Maybe from now on when I 'm  |p106take  it as a clue that I 'm about ready to fuck up on a grand scale . For the sake of fairness , I should consider one mitigating factor . It 's just faintly possible I was thrown into this spiral of stupidity by the shock of finding my father this afternoon . His being such a crushing disappointment might not have helped matters either . Careful , Witch Gloria , do n't let yourself off the hook too quickly . There 's work to be done . Right now . ( Witch Gloria . I like the sound of that . A little of the old , a little of the new . I guess I 've been missing my old name and did n't even realize it till now . Gloria . Hello , Gloria , dear old friend of my babyhood , dear bewildered , frightened , brave , lonely companion of my girlhood .... ) I paused just now for a cry . It was nice . The Automat gives you these paper napkins to blow your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This afternoon Sally Sunflower took me up to City College on the subway . Everyone was extremely helpful . But they have no Henry Glyczwyczes teaching in the History Department . I studied all the names in the catalog , hoping to find one that sounded like something you 'd change your name to if your name was Glyczwycz . But there were n't even any Henrys . We walked around the halls for a while because I had a hunch I 'd be able to pick up my father 's vibes if he was on the premises . But there were no vibes either . Coming back downtown on the subway , I got an awfulp107fit of anxiety . I told Sally I was afraid I 'd never find him , that I 'd spend my entire life expecting to run into him everywhere I went . In twenty years there 'd be this skinny , haggard , frenetic little madwoman running around from city to city , staying in tacky rented rooms , passing her days hangingaround History Departments looking for her father . Sally chose not to be comforting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But at the time I could have chewed her up and spit her out . Because she said , " Each of us can have any life he envisions for himself . " The brilliant thing about Sally is that in her sweet , wonderfulway , she 's absolutely uncompromising . She took my hand and said , " Oh , Witch , do n't you know if you 're supposedto find him , you will ? And if you 're not , you wo n't ? " I said , " Sally , I know you 're right . Of course you are . But do n't you see , I 've got a moon in Scorpio , and Scorpios are driven ! " " Only if they want to be , " she said . " If a person 's not determined to grow beyond her chart , rise above all the negative things in it , she 'd be better off tearing it up . Honestly , Witch . Astrology must n't be a map you follow until you 're in hell . It 's got to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train was making a ghastly noise that made me feel even more desperate and anxious . I was in no mood for the truth , and having it shouted into my ear did n't help much . Even while I was hearing it , I knew she was right , but something in me would n't let me up for a second . When we got to Columbus Circle , Sally said , " Come on ! " She got up and walked off the train . Subway maps have me completely flummoxed , so I had no choice but to follow her out onto the platform . She said , " I 'll tell you what ! We 'll go to all the colleges , one after another . We 'll do everything we can to find him . But if we fail , will you promise to give up ? " I promised.  |p108Then  she said there were two schools at this stop , Central Park J.C. , and Hunter , right across the park . We decided to try them both , and if my father was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the day and try N.Y.U. and the New School tomorrow . The first one we went to was Central Park J.C. , and we found him immediately . It could n't have been easier . We walked right into the Administration Building , went up to the desk and asked . No Glyczwyczes . Sally asked for a list of history courses . They gave it to her . The third one on the list was " Contemporary Events , Room 304 . Mondays , Wednesdays , Fridays , 3 to 4 P.M. H. Gliss . " I 'd already imagined his name might be something like Gliss , so of course it was perfectly clear we 'd found him . Sally said , " This is Monday , Witch , he 's probably up there right now . What do you want to do ? " I said , " I want to faint . " " Oh , my God , really ? " " Really . " She guided me to the drinking fountain . Which turned out to be one of those wonders of modern technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , and get your entire face squirted off . My hair was drenched . Anyway , it cooled me off . We sat on a bench in the hall and talked it over . What was I to do ? I could see only two alternatives . Walk right into the class , introduce myself , and then faint . Or wait till it was over , catch him coming out , and keel over in his arms . Sally said there must be something else . And I said , " You 're dead right , there is . I 'll pose as a student , call myself Rita LaFlubb or something , and look him over . If I do n't dig him , we can split . " " You mean , " Sally said , " you could actually see your father for the first time in your entire life , and walk away without telling him who you are ? "  | " Could I ever ! Come on , let 's go ! " Now that I had this sneaky little plan giving me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew up the stairs and down the hall , Sally right behind me , and waltzed into Room 304 without so much as a second thought . Furthermore , I sat in a front seat and looked right into his eyes . It 's a good thing I was sitting down . Because all my guts abandoned me the minute our eyes met . He hated me . He absolutely hated me . And I hated him right back . His eyes were awful : I felt like they were calling me dreadful names . They were saying , You 're stupid , you 're superficial , you 're late , you 're a female , you 're wasting my time , you 're worthless , why do n't you get the hell off this planet altogether ! And I was thinking , Watch your step , Professor Gliss , your daughter is a witch . She knows how to deal with hateful old bastards . She 's been trained by experts all her life . So cool it and cool it fast , or she 'll spit in your eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been pure carbolic acid and blinded him for life . By that time , he was looking at Sally . She must have been smiling , because he said good afternoon . Then he glanced at me again and went on talking to the class . My mind was chattering at me like some loony little bird . This is your father , it said , this is Daddy , this is Papa . One day a long time ago , this man got on top of your mother and planted you in her . The seeds of you came out of his balls . Those very balls are hanging there right now , inside of those awful baggy pants , and the stupid thing does n't even know you 're a part of him . He does n't know anything , not really . How can he ? He 's full of hate and meanness , and there is n't any room left in him for knowing anything . He does n't like you and he does n't like himself and he does n't like the world and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . What a sad man is my father . Gloria . Gloriap110dear , you are looking at Henry Glyczwycz . Is n't this what you 've been wanting to do since you were born , or at least since you were twelve , when you first heard of his existence ? This is Hank , this is your mother 's lover , the very man your Uncle Mickey told you about when you were twelve . He 'd just enjoyed one of Mother 's superduper special putdownsfor being drunk and he blurted out the whole works ! " Hey , Gloria , " he said on his way out to the car , " ask your mother how Hank is . Ask her if she 's heard anything from her kike lover lately . " You knew he was going to tell you something awful , but you knew you had to hear it because somehow you 'd always known anyway . Besides , you 're the kind of a chick who has to hear everything . And so you went to the car , drawn to it , magnetized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the front walk . " Gloria , get in this house . Gloria Random , do n't you go near that car . " But you went near it all right . You got in fast and sped away and in thirty seconds you had the whole story , diggingit totally right from the start . It was immediately and wildly thrilling to be the love child of a Polish Jew who 'd been thrown out of three universities for preaching Communism , to be so nearly a bastard you had every right to call yourself one , because if your mother had n't managed to drag that bloodless little broker to the altar in the nick of time , you 'd be one for real . ( But of course he was n't dragged , he was delighted . His self-satisfied little tail must have wagged all the way up the aisle . And it was n't in the nick of time either . The lump that was you was only three months along and probably had n't even begun to show yet . How could it , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried around this new knowledge of Gloria like a shining secret possession , whispering over and over again , I am not a WASP , I am not a WASP , I am not a WASP , until it all ran togetherand became IYAMNOTAWASP and lost some of its shine and nearly all of its sense . So you carried it over top111John 's basement and renewed it all by telling it out loud for the first time , and in the telling it got even better . " John , I just found out from my Uncle Mickey that I am a Polack Jew Bastard ! " But careful ! Careful this time not to squander the spell by repeating it too often . And then the phrase began to sink in , until it sank in deep , really deep , and became knowing . Knowing at last what you 'd only felt before , that you were truly and truly and truly an alien in Waspland , an exotic foreigner even by blood ! a stranger , caught  --  but only for a while !  --  in the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel frown , where words were for hiding behind and not for showing who you were . And now here you are 17 years later , sitting three yards from the man who made the lump . Why does he have to be so ordinary and mean and sad ? Is he ? Maybe he 's none of those things . You 're quite capable of making emotional judgments that turn out to be madly unsound . Pretend he 's not your father and look at him again . Carefully . Look at him with your witch eyes . See who he is . So that 's what I did . And everything turned upside down . He was n't ordinary any more . And I was n't at all certain he was mean either . Sad ? Yes , maybe . But then , most people in their forties , underneath all their attitudes and faces , seem awfully sad to me . Maybe I 'd been wrong about everything . For instance , why would any man bother to hate a strange chick  --  just for walking into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of school , practically everybody 's late . Try to listen to him , I instructed myself . Try hard . " So if you people come here for fairytales , stay home . Skip class . Play hookey . Do n't come at all . I 'll give you C for honesty . " He hit his tees too hard and said his final gees too carefully . He sounded like an overeducated dumbhead . His grammar was technically correct , but just barely , as if keepingit correct was a constant strain . He paced back and forthp112a lot , and his hairy hands were a burden to him . They kept going in and out of his pockets and making abortive little gestures . He fooled with the knot in his necktie , and I got the impression he was none too sure it was tied correctly and wondered how many of us were sitting there writing him off as square . Finally I got around to seeing him through my mother 's eyes . Supposing , I asked myself , I had to pick out the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute I asked , I knew : it was his fire . Mother 's old Hank Glyczwycz might be a lot of things , tiresome , irritable , who knows what else , but he was alive . Packed with life . And lean , too . You could n't really tell , in all these baggy brown tweeds , whether his leanness was jungle leanness or ulcer leanness . Maybe a little of both , because he was quick as a cat and uptight as a gangster . But either way , I could imagine my mother absolutelycraving that energy , wanting to soothe it and control it and hold it close and contain it . Then a weird mood struck me . Suddenly I 'd begun to sympathize with my mother . I felt myself to be her as she was 18 years ago , a pretty , uptight , carefully groomed virgin ( ? ) of 23 , terrified of becoming an old maid , office-working at Random Hogan Random and Hodge in the daytime , and trying to stir up a little safe trouble for herself after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Alacazam ! she meets this glamorous young refugee from Hitler 's Europe , an angry , husky , sexy dynamo from Hamtramck , and gets hooked ! I wondered if he was wearing the same necktie then . Probably not . But I bet he tied it with the same knot ! And I bet the backs of his hands were every bit as hairy as they are now . Mother . My mother . Dear mother , my babbling mind wrote her a letter , I am in the presence of your old lover and I know how it must have felt to be with him . Forgive me for not knowing before . Thisp113afternoon I think I love you a tiny bit more than usual . Do you suppose we 'll ever get to know one another ? Peace . Gloria . After class a few people went up to talk with him . His answers were curt and tough and official . There was no real hearing in them , no softness , no warmth , just rat-a-tat-tats with built-in fuck-yous . I stayed in my seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a smile for me , but all she could manage was one small anemic grin . " Would you like to go up and talk with him ? " she whispered . I shook my head no . When everybody but Sally and I had cleared out of the room , Professor Gliss , my father , stopped at the door and looked back at us . He looked at Sally actually , but I had a feeling what he was really doing was not looking at me . He said , " You girls want something ? " And I said , shocking myself terribly and knowing at once how wicked and hard it sounded , " Like what ? " He looked at me for a few seconds with a faint unpleasant smile on his mouth and said , " Careful , you might get it ! " Then he kept on looking at me , nodding his head several times , and left the room . I felt like I 'd been slapped . Not by him , but by myself . Why would I act that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little slut ? Sally said , " Are you all right , darling Witch ? " I started babbling about how marvelous I felt , how I 'd wanted to see him and now I had and that was that , and what did she think we ought to do with the rest of the afternoon . She said it was such a pretty day why did n't we walk in the park . So we went down to the street and looked at the day . It was n't pretty . It was spectacular . I loathed it . It hurt . It was one of those perfect young back-to-school days ,  |p114windy  and sunny and yet cool enough to carry a sweater just in case , and I felt such a nostalgia for other days that had been like it , days when I 'd been really young , with nothing grim working in my stomach . Had there been such days ? Of course , thousands of them ! So I began to impersonateone of them . I said , " Sally , I feel like a beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beautiful young girl ! " And I said , " Yes , but what I mean is I feel marvelous ! " And she said , " You are marvelous ! " And I said , " I know ! But Sally , please , listen . Do you suppose we can forget him entirely ? Forget we ever saw my father ? Just put him out of our minds and never think of him again ? " At that moment a boy and a girl came up to us with a petition . He was a shorthair cleancut number , and she was braided-and-sensible . The boy did the talking . " We saw you girls coming out of Gliss 's class , and we thought you might like to sign this . It 's a petition . Are you new here ? " I said , " What 's the petition ? " " We 're trying to get him out . " " Trying to get who out ? " " Gliss . Last semester we got a hundred and forty signatures , including a majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . This is a protest petition . " " What 's wrong with him ? " " Everything . Also we think he 's a Communist . That 's his business . But the point is he hates this country , all his courses are nothing but hate-America courses . We know our country 's not perfect but we refuse to pay out good money to be taught contempt for the flag . " Dear Mother , I saw Daddy today and he 's still up to the same old tricks . Peace . Gloria . Braided-sensible said to Sally , " Will you sign ? " " I ca n't , " Sally said . " I 'm not really interested in flags and nations . "  | " Not interested , " said B-and-S , " in what happens to your own country ? " Sally smiled one of her brightest sunflower smiles and said , " No , not really . I care what happens to our world ! " Shorthair cleancut gave B-and-S a knowing look and they walked away . I wonder what people with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Professor Gliss has enemies like that , he ca n't be all bad . " " Do you still want to forget you ever met him ? " " Yes . Absolutely . Forever . We have a pact . Will you forgethim , too ? " Sally agreed . So we went across Central Park West , climbed over the wall , and ran into the park . If anything , the day had improved . Blue was blue and green was green and air was air and people were people and I was me and Sally was Sally  --  and happiness was misery . Someone should invent spirit glasses that would do for your soul what sunglasses do for your eyes . Could n't the glare of just being , on a day like this , blind something in you even more preciousthan eyes ? I knew I was in a dangerous mood . And I knew if I had half a chance I 'd do something really foolish . Which is exactly what I did . After the park , we kept walking , and pretty soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Men 's Wear on the way to the basement , somebody said hi to Sally . It turned out to be this friend of hers who was selling pajamas . I 've forgotten his name already . But while we were standing there talking , the three of us , along came this dude named Edward  --  a friend of the one whose name I 've forgotten . Edward is an extremely sexy and magnificent-looking Leo , with a virile-plus body , and an Adam 's apple . He'sp116wearing an emerald-green shirt with a bright blue flowered scarf tied at the neck and tight-tight black bell-bottoms . The shirt 's open to the waist , so all the while we 're talking , I have to cope with this hairy hairy hairy chest . Obviously Edward sees his chest as quite an asset . He wears this shiny brass medallion hanging from a chain that hits him midway betweennavel and nipple . And just in case your attention happens to wander , there 's this medallion flashing away like crazy to bring your eye back home . From the start , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay , with a rich and witty tongue that goes like forever . But all the while he 's talking , I feel he 's looking at me the way a man looks at a woman . I 'm confused , but not the least bit turned on by him , because whether he 's gay or not , he 's a peacock , and he talks too much . Edward 's a make-up artist . " Probably the world 's finest . I create faces , " he says . " I make everyone a star . It 's the answer , do n't you see , to all the world 's problems . If everyone is a star , and knows that everyone else is a star , then the entire world becomes this perfectly glorious TV studio , with everyone treating everyone else with the most supreme deference . The theory 's as old as Aristotle . Beauty is harmony . And if everyone is beautiful , there 's harmony everywhere . Would America be committing genocide in Vietnam if it realized how fabulously gorgeous the Vietnamese are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biafra ? As for police brutality , it would disappear overnight . When was the last time a star got beat up in a parking lot by the fuzz ; or hassled for walking down a street ? Remember what I 'm telling you and think it over carefully ! I have stumbled upon the greatest secret for turning people on since LSD . How do I know it ? I 've proven it ! Everyone who comes to me for a face , I treat just like a star , and when they leave , I swear to you I have them so convinced , you can actually see stardom shooting out of them like rays . Instant Charisma . Naturally I chargep117for it . Money bores me , but I have to eat . Besides , I 'm a star too , are n't I ? So of course I have to live like one ! Now tell me the truth , did you know I was wearing false eyelashes ? Of course you did n't . Not until I said so . Men are n't ready to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do imperceptible things . But they 're doing it , my dear , men have really begun ! Would you believe me if I told you there is a policeman in this city , walking the Broadway beat at this exact second , wearing false eyelashes ? I never lie . I swear this to you on my mother 's eyes . I sold them to him myself and taught him how to use them . Within five years false eyelashes for men will be sold openly in every gas stationfrom here to California  --  right in slot machines next to the rubbers . People do n't seem to realize it , but we 're havinga goddam revolution , and it 's really talking place ! " He pointed at me . " You , by the way , have a face already . I could n't do a thing for you . You 're already a star . And you "  --  he pointed at Sally  --  " are also a star . But your face could use some help . Too much sunniness , too much light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , yes indeed ! I know precisely what I 'd do with you  --  a few shadows , mostly at the eyes . And then that fabulous frizzy hair would really pay off big . It 'd go absolutely zingo ! You 'd step out into the street , traffic would come to a standstill , the National Guard would be called in , Congress would meet in emergency session , you 'd be declared a public hazard and forced to wear veils for all public appearances ! Incidentally , I 'm in love with you both . I never sleep with women , because I 'm much too much in awe of them . But I do worship them . I 'm putty in their hands . Therefore I 'm inviting both of you to my studio . It 's exactly a block and a half from here on Madison , and I want you to come with me this minute . I have no more appointments for the day , we can just smoke a little grass , and , if you like , I 'll let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me , what do you think of this idea ? Does itp118touch your little buttons ? Does it arouse anything ? Will you come ? " I do n't think I 'd said a single word the whole time . When somebody 's as sparkling and overpowering in their rap as Edward is , I have a hard time getting my mouth together for a response . Sally said she thought it would be fun , but it was her day to cook , so she took a raincheck . I might have gone home with her , but Edward was really insistent . Besides I wanted to go with him . When somebody seems to like me , I find him irresistible . Also , it occurred to me that through Edward I might meet some groovy homosexuals and one of them could become a lover for Roy . So I told Sally I might not be home for dinner . Edward and I walked her to the subway and then the two of us went flying along 59th Street . He said , " Witch , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I still had n't done any talking or contributed anything , but I took the compliment as well as I could . He said , " Let 's skip ! Shall we ? " Edward took my hand  --  and we skipped ! All the way to Park Avenue . Suddenly I realized I was a young girl in New York , spending an afternoon with a glamorous , bizarre , slightly obnoxious but very sweet nut , and I really threw myself into it . I felt like I was acting in an old-timey Hollywoodmusical with Gene Kelly . On Park Avenue they have this skinny little island running down the middle with grass and flowers . Edward said , " Watch ! " Then he jumped the fence and did about a dozen cartwheels . Other pedestrians and even people in cars waiting for the light to change watched with their eyes popping . When he was finished , Edward took a number of bows and blew kisses at the traffic . A black boy about 12 wearing a baseball hat and an enormous grin was standing next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy said ,  | " Hey , are you on TV ? " Edward said , " Yes I am , I 'm a great star , and so are you . " Then he made a camera with his hands and pointed it at the kid 's face and said , " Are you ready ? " The kid said , " Ready for what ? " Edward dropped the cameraand took the boy 's hand in both of his and pumped it full of congratulations . " That was perfect ! Absolutely perfect ! You did that scene in one take ! " He took a roll of bills from his pocket and gave the boy a five , saying , " Do you realize your network is paying you at the rate of one dollar a second ? That makes you the highest paid star in America . " Then the light changed . Edward took my hand and we ran across Park Avenue . Halfway across , I looked back at the kid . He was holding the five-dollar bill , and hollering " Do I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess so . Edward said , " Witch , my one ambition is to elevate the entire world to stardom ! Do you think I 'll succeed ? " His studio , which he calls an atelier , is above an antique shop . Right at the top of the stairs there 's a door with a sign painted on it in gold : MAQUILLAGE  --  EDWARDYou enter the place through a small room with nothing in it but three bright-colored poufs like fluffy little mushroomsarranged on a white carpet , and three or four fashion magazines lying on the floor . " Does a waiting room have to be a waiting room ? " he said . I just smiled . I realized by now Edward prefers to answer his own questions . " Of course not , " he said . " Besides , stars never wait . They may , however , choose to have their famous little butts pamperedfor a few minutes while I 'm preparing to go to work on their faces . But that 's not waiting , is it ? Now look in here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside everything was black . Edward flipped a switch and suddenly there were all these streams of light coming from everywhere . You could n't see any walls or ceilings , just these columns of light . Edward drew me along behind him and everywhere I stepped I saw myself in some mirror , each one with lightingthat was entirely different from the one before . Edward said , " I 'm vastly gifted in interior design , but I never design rooms . I dislike rooms , they 're too limiting . I do interrupted infinities . Infinities interrupted by light . Besides , stars are accustomed to performing under great banks of light , n'est-ce pas ? And this "  --  suddenly we were behind a screen  --  " is the corner where the magic takes place . " There was an elegant little upholstered bench , which he said a friend had stolen for him from the Cleopatra set . Edward was holding up a big beige smock . " Step into this , " he said , " and lie down . " When he was absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to a little white table that was crowded with pots of paint , brushes , sponges , pencils . He looked back and forth from the table to me , rubbing his hands with delight . " Witch , this is terribly exciting . I feel I 'm about to surpass myself , and it 's more than I can bear . Here , we 'll start with hashish . " He got out a Turkish water pipe and prepared it : a little chunk of hash on a bed of grass . We had two good tokes each , and then Edward went to work on my face . It seems to me he used every color and every piece of equipment on the table , and of course he chattered on as he worked . I was n't allowed to see what was happening , but three minutes later he told me to get up , I was completed . Off went the smock , on went a silver lame cape with fur hanging all over it . He said Angela Lansburyhad worn it in Mame and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screen again , where all the infinities were interrupted by light.  | " Voila ! " he said . " Presenting ! Witch Gliz ! Ta-taaaaaa ! " Suddenly I saw this glorious movie star and I knew she was me . " Now preen yourself , Miss Gliz , " he said . " Glide about under the lights . Drink in the glory that is you ! Suffocate , my dear , under the sheer impact of your own incomparable beauty ! " And that 's exactly what I did . I saw myself from a dozen different angles , under every kind of lighting , and I was simplybreathtaking . I do n't know what he 'd done to my face . But it worked . It may not have been me in these mirrors , but whoever the chick was , she was a star ! At the last mirror Edward said , " And the winner is Witch Gliz ! For her perfoidnance in the Edward Atelier production of A Star Is Born ! " He handed me a little gold statuette . It was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time all afternoon , I knew what to say . " Ladies and gentlemenof the Academy , " I said , addressing faceless thousands in the dark . " My entire career would be nothing  --  if it had n't been for a humble little man named Edward who happens to be the world 's greatest cosmetician . Thank you . " " Then I sobbed and ran through the lights to the other side of the screen . I must have really gotten into the part , because I was all flushed with excitement and had to lie down on the couch and catch my breath . Edward came in and stood looking at me with adoration . He was perspiring and there was almost a kind of pleading in his voice when he said , " Witch , is it fun ? Are you having fun ? " If it had n't been fun , I would have lied to him . Because he looked so dear and anxious to please . All I said was yes . He could see the rest in my face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . We had one more toke apiece from the pipe and then went floating down the stairs and into the streets.  |p122We  ran , we skipped , we pranced , we took bows , we caused perfect strangers to smile , we made a personal appearancebefore God and all the angels at St. Patrick 's Cathedral . We picked flowers at Rockefeller Center . Edwardhired a winged chariot , and we flew down Fifth Avenue , soared high above adoring crowds , in and out of busy little skyways , between skyscrapers . We tossed flowers to children and nuns and peace signs to everyone we passed . Edward held my hand in the taxi and put his arm around me . " You 're more fun to be with than any girl I 've known . Have you had fun being with me ? " And then instead of talking on and on as usual , he waited for me to answer , and I realized he actually wanted to know whether or not I was enjoying myself . I could hardly believe it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him that even though I 'd had miraculous things happen to me since I 'd arrived in New York , nothing had been more fun than this afternoon with him . " Really and truly ? " he said . " Really and truly . " He seemed terribly happy , as if I 'd given him an Oscar . So I thought I 'd lay on a little more for him . I said , " You 're a wonderful man , Edward . " " Am I ? " he said , and then he looked out the window in a way that looked as if he were very seriously thinking about what I 'd said . I spoke to his profile and his wild Adam 's apple . " You really are . I 've never met anyone before who tried so hard to make somebody happy . The only thing I wonder about is how you can squander your genius on something like cosmetics . " He thought for a minute before he answered . Then , " Two reasons , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good way to turn on people who might not otherwiseget the opportunity . And two , I 'm a silly fucked-up shitp123who does n't know whether he 's coming or going . " The more I heard Edward talk the more I respected him . The last part of the taxi ride was quiet , and for the first time I had a chance to think about Edward without having to watch him perform and respond to his talk . I had a chance to realize he did n't honestly think much of himself . In his own eyes he was just a fag who was putting something over on the world . At times like this I wish I did n't have such insight into people , because it made me a little sad . I decided to spend the rest of the evening finding ways to make him happy . Since he was homosexual , I did n't even considerseducing him , but I was determined to do everything a woman can to make a man pleased about himself . The taxi took us to Kip 's Bay , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the elevator with us . Edwardintroduced me as his sister from Detroit . The boy got out before we did , and Edward turned to me and said , " Was that okay ? You do n't mind being my sister ? " I said , " No , I love it . " " Can I tell everyone you really are my real blood sister ? " " Well , you could , " I said . " But the truth is even more exciting , is n't it ? That we just suddenly met and loved one another ? " " Oh , you 're right ! You 're absolutely right ! It 's infinitely more exciting ! I used to want a blood sister , but now I do n't . All I want is you . " " The elevator stopped at the 14th floor and we got out . As we walked down the hall , he said , " Did you really mean that though ? That we suddenly met and loved one another ? I know I love you , but do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " We 'd arrived at his door . He had the key in the lock . " Do you ? " I looked at him and smiled and nodded real hard . " And you do n't want me to go to bed with you or any-thing ? "  |p124I  shook my head and kept smiling . " No . I just love you , that 's all . No hangups . " Edward 's pad has hot pink walls , Oriental carpets , and a cushion on the floor the size of a double bed . One wall is entirely glass and it looks out on the East River . The only furniture in the entire room is this enormous paisley cushion and a big round brass cocktail table near the window . The minute we got inside the door , Edward started taking his clothes off . " I always run around naked , do you mind ? " I said , " No , of course not . Can I ? " " Paradise ! " So we got out of our clothes and admired each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the stereo and then he said , " Watch ! " and took off like a bird , leaping across the room and landing on his belly on this giant cushion near the brass table . I oh 'd and ah 'd and applaudedand sat next to him , and he said , " Now it 's time to stoke our heads , do n't you think ? " And he went to work loading a pipe with grass . The table had all sorts of interesting things on it : incense burners and exotic little boxes and pipes for smoking every kind of dope imaginable . Real flowers , too , red roses . And candles of all sizes and shapes . We lit them all , and a dozen sticks of amber incense , too . Then Edward got some goodies from the refrigerator  --  cheese and chicken and Sara Lee banana cake and Coca-Cola . We had everything we could possibly want , and I began to feel my crazy anxiety again . Everything was too perfect . The view from his window was just too staggering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over town , but it was still twilight and you could see the sky , a clear starry blue . Obviously it was all real . It was n't a stage set or anything , but still it seemed unreal . And that was how Edward suddenly seemed to me , with his craggy , tense face and his splendid physique . Hep125was just too high . And so was his apartment . It was too thrillingly comfortable , too breathtakingly beautiful . Everythingabout him was too much . Too much in wonderful ways , but still too much . I thought about the rickety old tumbledown home Roy and I had found on Canal Street and about everyone sitting at the table , probably at that exact moment , eating Sally 's meal . Or maybe holding hands in thanksgiving , Zapping each other and the whole world with love . Edward picked up on my mood and it made him anxious . " Are you all right ? " he said . " Is anything wrong ? " " Yes , " I said . " We forgot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom on Canal Street and he was all for it . So we sat there cross-legged facing each other , holding each other 's hands . " What should I do ? " he said . " Should I pray or something ? Because I 'm not sure I believe in God actually . It 's not that I do n't . But I have n't really gotten into religion yet . " " I do n't know if I believe in God or not either , " I said . " But I believe in something . Because otherwise , how could we be so beautiful ? " " That 's true , Witch . There must be something even more fabulous than we are  --  to think the whole thing up ! " " That 's just what my guru says . " " You have a guru ? " " Yes . He 's also my best friend . His name is Roy . He 's nineteen , he 's gay , and he knows all about God . " " Fantastic ! " " He really is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Of course . " " Is he sexy ? " " Terribly . But it depends what turns you on . " " Am I sexy ? "  | " Definitely . " " To you ? " " Yes , very . " " Witch , may I touch your breast ? " " Of course . " He did , and it sent a shock all through me . " I guess you better stop . " " Why ? Did I excite you ? " " Yes . " " Oh , my God ! I 'm excited , too . This has never happened to me before , Witch . " " Really ? " " Never with a woman . I do n't even know what to do ! " " You do n't have to do anything . " " But should n't we make love or something ? " " Only if we want to . " " I do , Witch . I want to . Do you ? " " I think it 'd be beautiful to make love with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm afraid you 'll laugh at me . " " How could I laugh ? I do n't know how either . " " You mean you 've never ? " he said . " Oh , I 've made love lots of times . But it 's always different . I mean there is n't any special way . You just enjoy the person , in whatever ways you can both dig . " " But what if I do n't satisfy you ? " " Well , that 's the breaks ! Maybe I wo n't satisfy you either , but I 'm not going to worry about it . " " Is n't that the whole point ? To satisfy each other ? " " No , " I said , " the whole point is to love each other . Is n't that how it happens with another boy ? " " I guess . But then , I do n't know really . Because I 'm always so interested in being terrific that  --  " " Edward , nobody 's terrific all the time with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like I 've just got to be . Do n't you see ? " " Wow , is n't that an awful drag ? " " Look ! I 'm not excited now . " " Neither am I ! " " You 're not ? " " No ! Should I be ? " " I guess not . " " Can I finish your drumstick ? " He did n't answer , so I started eating it anyway . " Goddamnit , " he said , " I should n't have talked so much ! " " Why ? " " Because now we 're not making love . " " That 's cool . I mean , after all , we had things to talk about , did n't we ? Are n't you hungry ? " " No . I 'm depressed . " " Have another toke . " " Fantastic idea . " While he was holding the smoke in his lungs , he said , " Are you disappointed , Witch ? " " You mean because we 're not making love ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up here for that . I came here to be with you . " He let out the smoke and said , " You know , Witch , you 're saying all the right things . " Suddenly I felt caught . Because he was right . I had been trying to say all the right things . I wanted to please him . I wanted to be the first woman he 'd ever made love with and leave him feeling manly and terrific about himself . Then I thought , My God , he 's impossible ! What does he want me to do , say all the wrong things ? So I put down the chicken bone , all set to tell him how difficult I thought he was being , when he took my hand , the one that had held the chicken , and started licking my fingers . He was really enjoying himself , too . So was I. Just then a new record plopped down onp128the turntable , and the Stones started singing : " She 's like a rainbow , she comes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Terrifically . I just know I could write some rich pornography right now . I could describe everything that happened between us , and sell it and make pots of money . The plot would be about these two people who both have overwhelming urges to be terrific in bed , and what happens when they get together . They both try so hard to please that they succeed ! And they 're left feeling empty . At least the woman is . She does n't feel empty because of what happened between them but because of what happens right after . The man falls asleep on this enormous cushion . The woman lights a cigarette and sits cross-legged behind him with one hand resting on his hip . She sits there thinking the whole thing over a hundred times , what splendid angelic animals they both are , and how great they 'd been for each other . She 's always been eager to prove to herself how sexy she is . Up to now , she suspected herself of being a bit of a phony . But here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman before , and he 's lying next to her now , asleep , happy , and exhausted . She 's not only shared a miraculous and special experience with him , she 's also presented him with proof that he can please a woman . She goes to the mirror in the bedroom so she can have a look at this remarkable chick , and while she 's standing there savoring the full impact of her wondrous self , someone else appears in the mirror . It 's not the man . It 's someone else . Another man . He waves at her , says , " Hi , there . " The woman hides her breasts and screams like some stupid little virgin . The man says , " It 's all right , I wo n't peek . I just want to change clothes . " He goes to the closet and starts taking off his shirt . The woman sees her clothes on the bed . She grabsp129them and runs into the bathroom . Apparently without realizingit , she 's been apologizing all over the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through it while she dresses . " No reason to be uptight , " he says . " We 're always going around naked . Please do n't be upset . Are you all right ? " " Yes , I 'm fine , " she says . " I 'll be out in a minute . " When she comes out of the bathroom dressed , she feels better . The man 's wearing dungarees now and a Levi jacket painted all over with Day-Glow designs . He starts hanging strings of beads around his neck . He turns to her , says , " I 'm a plastic hippie , " and grins . Then he reaches into a drawer and comes out with a longhair wig and puts it on . The woman says , " I guess you two are roommates . " " Yeah , " he says , " but there 's no problem . We both make it with chicks , too . " The woman does n't get the full import of this all at once . But slowly it dawns on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She draws him carefully into telling her more about their arrangement . They 've been lovers , but it 's a completely open situation . Actually , they prefer women . " Does he prefer women , too , " she asks . " He adores them . Let 's see what he 's done to your eyes . " " He studies her painted face . " Beautiful ! He never repeats himself . " " You mean , " she says carefully , " he paints each of his chicks differently ? " " Mm . Is n't he fantastic ? " " Yes . He really is , really fantastic . " " Have you seen a couple of Fillmore East tickets anywhere ? Oh ! I know where they are ! " He finds the tickets in an old coat pocket and leaves the apartment . The woman is left with her sleeping lover , but she feelsp130entirely alone . She looks out the big window . The sky is black now but there are millions of lighted windows . A sleepy voice behind her says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't look at him . " I thought I 'd better go now , " she says . " Will I ever see you again ? " She thinks for a minute . " Probably not , " she says . After a long silence the man says , " Okay , I understand . I 'm the same way you are . Once usually does it . " The woman thinks she 'd better get out of this place prettyfast . But she takes a few seconds to kiss him on the cheekand tell him he 's a magnificent lover . When she gets to the door , he jumps up to open it for her . They smile at one another . She walks down the hall and while she 's waiting for the elevator , he steps out into the hall , still naked and splendid , and calls to her . " Do n't forget you 're a star , " he says . " Oh , I wo n't ! " she says . " Not ever . " In the movie version , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real life she has to wait quite a while for it . However , this dame is her mother 's daughter , i.e. , a colossal phony . She 's able to fill in with small talk and cigarette lighting . SHE : Hey , mister , your fly 's open . HE : ( Laughs and laughs . Funniest joke ever . ) Oh , that undid me utterly ! Please , marry me tonight ! I 'd give my soul to have such wit in my life . SHE : Sucker ! It was n't even original . HE : Screw originality . It 's timing that matters. smE : Go inside , you 'll get busted for lewd vag . HE : Listen , I can use the publicity already ! sHE : Blah blah blah . HE : Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah . SHE : Blah blah blah blah.  |p131HE  : Blah blah blah . SHE : Blah ! ! ! Coming down on the elevator , I saw a little electronic eye that seemed to be and probably was n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagining myself on TV being watched on a home screen by some elderly man . He 's in his bed watching the Witch Gloria Show with great fascination . It 's in black and white and he 's been watching all day long . Now he sees me on the elevator leaving my lover 's apartment . He 's a nice man , straight , oldish , like forty maybe , no hair left on top , a hurt , disappointed-looking cat , not bitter but a little sad . And he turns to his wife , who is n't even listening  --  she fell asleep , but he has n't noticed yet  --  he turns to his sleeping wife and says , " This girl does n't seem to be having much fun after all , does she ? " And he switches channels . They 're doing " The Star Spangled Banner " on this one , so he knows they 're about to sign off . This makes him feel a little desperate , because he 's not even sleepy yet . Neither am I.p132CANAL STREET , TUESDAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I reviewed my disaster of yesterday and decided it was definitely minor . I 'm not pregnant , because I 'm on the pill , so nobody was hurt . My ego got knocked around a little , but that 's okay . Roy says ego bruises can bring about an increase of wisdom , so the whole thing could hardly be called a disaster . Just a blunder  --  or maybe a blunderette . No , not even that . I had a very good time with a very dear , superficial , attractive ass , not to mentiongaining lots of new experience for my autobiography . At first , when he poured Drambuie all over my breasts , I thought he 'd freaked out , but when he started licking it off , the whole thing began to make sense . Edward may be part fink , but he 's tremendously imaginative and free . I tried to top him by putting his penis in my mouth ( another first ! ) but I do n't suppose he dug it as much as he pretended to . Anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be able to write with authority on the subject . I 'll explain to my readers the ritual value of penis-sucking , how every real woman shouldp133take joy in paying homage to the fabulous male organ from which emerges the sacred seeds of human life . Besides it 's sort of groovy . Roy was n't in bed last night . When I came in , postblunderette , I needed him . But he was n't here . And then I began to realize I 've seen very little of him since we moved in here . I 've been running around with Sally and Cary , and he 's been spending practically every waking minute with Archie and Jeanette . I hope we 're not drifting apart . I miss him . I guess what I miss most is his needing me . What good 's an earth mother without any children ? But that 's not all of it . Roy is my beautiful lifelong friend and brother , my soul 's tender lover , and I would like him always to be in my life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's a bummer to run all the way home from a foolish , lonesome experience and not have somebody to hug . I suppose I could have hugged Sally or just about anybody , but it 's not the same . Tonight while we were doing the dishes , I told Roy about seeing Hank Glyczwycz teach his class . Something about that entire thing is still bugging me , and I was hoping Roy 'd be able to help . I asked him if he had any idea why a person would continue to think so hard about someone they were n't really interested in any more . Roy said , " After all , he 's your father . It 's only natural you 'd keep thinking about him for a while  --  even if you do n't dig him . " I suppose he 's right . But I 'm still not satisfied . One thing that really freaks me out is that I ca n't remember Glyczwycz'sface any more and it 's only been two days .

Fabulous visions , impressions . Feel great urge to write it all down . Ca n't . Words get in the way . Reality is reality and words are words . Besides , my pen is turning into a rose.  |p143CANAL  STREET , SUNDAY , SEPTEMBER 21 , 1969Last night we all dropped acid . The stuff had some speed in it and I ended up rapping too much and grinding my teeth a lot , but I do n't regret it , because so many groovy things happened . A. I heard the Electric Prunes ' Mass in F Minor . B. I stopped being hung up on Archie . C. Doris came back from California and caught us all stark naked and tripping . ( Why do I say caught ? Is my life forever to be plagued with guilt ? I think I 'll do C all over again . ) C. I made a new friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. I made a second new friend . Her name is Sara and she 's a ghost . Archie had come in about an hour before dinner with a dozen tabs of orange sunshine . He said it was the same very high stuff Timothy Leary recommended in an East Villagep144Other interview in the spring . Anyway he passed it around . Nyoom frowned at it for a moment . Then he said , " If this is the sacred substance recommended by the High Priest himself , one can hardly decline . " " He took a tab and popped it into his mouth . Sally said she preferred to abstain , but assured us she 'd be tripping right along with the rest of us on a contact high . Cary Colorado said he had n't tripped since Boulder , and he was interested in seeing what it would do for him . ( Later I asked him how it compared with the high he got on meditationand he said he found the acid pretty sloppy . ) Jeanette took a tab without comment . Roy looked at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I told him it was his head . " Yeah , but are you going to ? " I said yes . So Roy and I dropped , too . Cary put the new Donovan record on the stereo , the one about Atlantis . By dinnertime we are all having rushes and nobody was interested in eating . We all took our clothes off . Cary 's idea . At first I was nervous about being naked with Archie . I was afraid I 'd start hallucinating the two of us making love all over the place , or that we 'd get into a pure lust thing that could put me on a bummer . ( What 's wrong with pure lust ? I do n't really know , but if just thinking about it can put you in a down head , what would the experience itself do ? ) Anyway , I need n't have worried . Because seeing Archie under acid , clothes or no clothes , had the opposite effect on me . Aphrodite went out the window . Earth Mother moved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever will again . His body is as lovely as his face , but the acid made him seem so helpless and alone . Maybe acid makes what your soul is more important than what your body is . I do n't know . But I was seeing auras all night , like on my very first trip . Archie 's was a color I 'd never seen before , indescribable ,  |p145sort  of a dark puce with very little light in it . It 's almost not there . Also , I saw not just auras but souls , too . At least I think I was seeing souls . It was as if all of our bodies existed inside of a quivery watery sheath . I tried to write about this last night but I could n't . I guess there are things that refuse to allow themselves to be written down . Or maybe I do n't know enough words . Anyway , with acid , hiding does n't work . You show who you are . Archie 's whole being comes through as a selfish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose all souls are , if you really see them . I had no interestin Archie sexually , and yet my breasts actually ached . I felt as if my soul wanted to suckle him and nourish him , but it did n't know how to go about it . Seeing Archie so clearly gave me a real insight into the dangers of acid . My own trips have been pretty glorious experiences , but I 've always had high friends around who could help me use my paranoia and turn it into a growth trip . For some reason I 've never really had major problems about keeping my head straight , but Archie is a mess . A half a dozen times through the night someone had to be with him holding him and comforting him and telling him everything was all right . At one point he thought the house was on fire and could n't be talked out of it . Finally we all had to put our clothes on and take him outside and show him everything was okay . Then we brought him back inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later he was whisperingto Nyoom , " The house is n't on fire . Right ? " And Nyoom said , " No , Archie . The house is beautiful . So are you , and so am I. And everything 's cool . " " The first really interesting event of the evening was meetingSara the Ghost . Sally and I had been up on the roof in Will 's greenhouse trying to see gnomes in the flowerpots . Sally 's convinced each plant has a little invisible creaturep146tending its roots and she was hoping with acid we 'd be relaxedenough to see them . We were n't . But on the way back downstairs , just as we were coming to the first landing , Sally stopped and said , " Far out ! " I said , " What 's happening ? " And she said , " I 'm getting extra strong ghost vibes . Just stand still right here and see if you can pick them up . " I stood still for a few seconds , looking into the dark , and I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw the ghost . There was this big watery-looking oval of space , like a full-length mirror with blurry edges , and she was sitting inside of it in a rocking chair , watching me with an enormous grin on her face . The most far-out part of it all is that I was n't even surprised . I said , " I can see her , Sally . She 's right here . " " Oh , Witch ! Can you truly ? " By this time the ghost was waving at me , so I waved back and said , " Hello there ! " She had on an 189os-ish costume and her hair was all braided tight across the crown of her head . Her face was homely but nice to look at , and the expression on it was terribly dear . She looked so pleased , you 'd have thought we were old friends . Sally said , " Oh , Witch , I 'm so excited ! Please ! Tell me what she 's like . " " I described her as well as I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ghost seemed to be talking at the same time . I said , " Are you talking to me ? " She nodded brightly and said , " I certainly am . You 're the only one in this entire house that can see and hear me ! " I said , " Good lord , am I ? Why , do you suppose ? " The ghost shrugged . " I just knew you 'd be able to , if you ever really looked . And tonight you 're really looking . I 'm so pleased . " " Would you like to tell me your name ? " I asked . " I 'm Sara . And I know yours already . You 're Witch . "  |p147Sally  said , " Witch ! You 're having a conversation with her ! Please tell me everything she says . I 'm just dying ! " I tried to describe Sara 's voice to her . I could n't actually hear it with my ears but I could see her mouth going and I knew what she was saying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . It was just pure communication . Exceptthat I spoke out loud . Maybe Sara would have heard me even if I had n't , but it did n't occur to me to try . I had a voice , so I used it . So the ghost and I chatted for a while . Sometimes I asked questions for Sally and relayed Sara 's answers . It all seemed very natural at the time . And now as I think about it , it still does . The lady was dead , but so what ? Body or no body , she still had things to say . I ca n't record her words accurately , of course , because I was n't actually hearing , not in the usual sense . My head just sort of supplied words to go with her meanings . And this is the story that came out of it : Sara had been living in this house for more than loo years . Before that she and her father had lived in Puerto Rico , where he was an exporter . Then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since . By the time he died , in 189osomething , Sara was a full-fledged old maid , and afraid to leave the house . She said the streets were dangerous then . I wanted to say she ought to have a look at them now , but I did n't want to interrupt . Anyway , after Sara died , she was still afraid to leave the place , and simply stayed in . She told how awful it was to stand by and watch while all the family furniture was moved out and their effects disposed of , but there was nothing she could do about it . ( Somehow I guess she was able to salvage that rocker  --  or maybe it was just a ghost rocker . We did n't get into that . ) Over the years a series of different families moved in and out , none of them very interesting to her , so she sort of checked out most of the time . I did n't ask how ghosts did that , but I suppose to protect themselves when they 're bored , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . In the 19205 a couple of honeymooners moved in and she fell in love with both of them . Soon they had three sons , and everything went along beautifully for about ten years . Then the depression came along and the couple started quarreling about money all the time , so Sara began checking out again . She still loved them as much as ever , but when they were unhappy their conversation was repetitious and tedious to listen to . The boys grew up and went into the Army , and one of them , Sara 's favorite , got killed . World War II , I guess . Sara kept hoping he 'd come back as a ghost and live in the house with her , but he never did . So Sara took the gold star that had been hanging in the window to commemorate his death and began wearing it around her neck . I 'm very confusedabout how ghosts pull off these little stunts , but I supposethe gold star is a ghost like the rocker , and like Sara herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sadnessuntil finally quite suddenly the people moved away . I asked Sara if she 'd ever spoken with any of the members of that family and she said , " Yes , I talked to them a great deal at first , all of them . But the only one who ever heard me was the one little boy , my favorite . I used to tell him bedtime stories and in the mornings he 'd tell his mother about the lady in the rocking chair that visited him at night , and at first his mother said , Oh , that 's nice , dear , but after a while she started getting angry with him . So one night I told him I thought I 'd better not talk to him any more for a while . I was afraid as he grew older our conversations might confuse him , so I forced myself to be still . Later , years perhaps , or perhaps just days later , I 'm not sure , I tried to talk to him again but he could n't hear me any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's life , " she said . " People come and go . " Afterwards there was a long series of people in the place , none of them the least bit interesting to her . Then suddenly a couple of years ago Peter moved in and beganp149to accumulate his family of freaks , and she 'd been fascinated with life ever since . She said if she was forced to carry on a conversation with a straight person right that minute , she did n't think she 'd remember how . She threw her head back and laughed , then she rocked back and forth a couple of times till she 'd calmed down . I asked her how she felt about the life style of Peter 's family . She thought it was wonderful and beautiful and brave . " Just wait , " she said , " until you meet Will . You 're going to fall in love with him . " I said I thought I already had , in a way . And she said , " But you really will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's goingto do ? He 's going to bring an end to war ! " I tried to question her further about Will , but she started going on about the others . She said she 'd learned to meditate with Cary and whenever we formed a circle she always joined in . Her favorite event of the day was the mealtime Zap . " Tonight , " she said , " I 'm stoned on acid . " That blew my mind . I told Sally . Sally said it made perfect sense , you did n't need a body to get high . " In fact , " she said , " you can probably get higher without them ! " Then Sally said , " Listen , Witch , I think you should ask Sara if there 's anything we can do for her . " I said , " Like what ? " " I do n't know , " she said , " but ask . " So I did . And Sara said , " Yes , as a matter of fact , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? It 's been a hundred years now . Often I feel I should move on , but I 'm still so frightened I just end up staying . And of course I 'm more torn than ever now , because I 'd miss you all so . I ca n't tell you how much you 've helped my head . " Sally loved that . " Oh , we 've helped Sara 's head , " she cried , clapping her hands together . " Is n't that super ? Tell her she 's helped mine , too . Tell her every time I pass her in the hall I dig her cool . From now on , of course , I 'll speak !  |p150I  think I 'll speak now . " She looked into the corner where I 'd been looking and gave a tentative little wave of her fingers . " Hi there , Sara dear , " she said . And then , to me , " What 'd she say , Witch , did she hear me ? " I reported that Sara thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands with joy . But I was interested in getting back to Sara 's problem about whether or not she should leave Canal Street . I wanted to know why she was asking my advice . I told her whatever experience I may have had as a ghost in the past had completely slipped my mind , so I did n't know what to tell her . Sara said , " Yes , Witch , but you know as much about it as I do . And you 're much more level-headed than I am . Please , take a moment , imagine yourself in my shoes . What would you do ? " Suddenly I knew exactly what to tell her . " If it was me , " I said , " I 'd stick around here and groove until it was n't interestingany more . Then ? Who knows , if I felt like it , I 'd probably take off . " " Even if you were frightened ? " she said . I told her if it seemed the right thing to do , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I could n't be sure . By this time we 'd been talking for a long time , probably an hour or more . The conversation must have been taking tremendous energy from me , because suddenly I felt totally depleted . I told Sara I thought I 'd like to rest for a while . She understood , but she was disappointed . " I 'm not usually so selfish , " she said . " It 's just that you 're the first person in more than forty years who 's heard me when I spoke . " I said I thought that must be really awful , and she said , " You get used to it . Now go rest , Witch Gloria , there 'll be other days . " When she called me Witch Gloria an odd little look went with it . I was just on the verge of asking her if she realized I sometimes called myself that secretly , when she said , " Ip151watch you write in your journal . I hope you do n't mind . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , it 's okay , " I said . " I do n't think I mind . Is it interesting to you ? " " Oh , yes ! " she said . Wow , I thought . I 've got a reader ! It must have been around mid-trip when we got into the Electric Prunes . Before that each of us had been pretty busy doing his own thing , Archie alternating between playinghis guitar and freaking out , Nyoom and Cary spending most of their trip squatting Buddhalike in a corner trying to get into samadhi , Roy and Jeanette appearing and disappearingall over the house . At one point they took a shower together , giggling like children and playing games with foam from the shampoo . I was invited to join them and might have except that at the moment they asked me Sally and I were on the way up to Will 's greenhouse to visit the gnomes . Anyway , the Electric Prunes ' Mass in F Minor brought us all together . When the Kyrie started , everyone more or less fainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to me and held my hand and whispered how glad he was we were tripping together , because I was his favorite person in the entire solar system . It 's a good thing I was lying down , because his words gave me this enormous love blast , which I can still feel even now . A lot of the things you experience on acid seem ( whether they do or not ) to disappear into thin air the next day , but the loving never does . You remember it and keep on feeling it . At least I do . Also , Roy and I had shared a whole big Electric Prunes trip back in Belle Woods , so the music made us aware again of all the terrific highs we 'd had together.  |p152After  the Gloria , I said to him , " Is n't this music absolutely superultramysticalMcZapp ? " He said , " SuperultramysticalMcZapp ? " I said , " Right ! " He said , " Loved the McZapp . " And I said , " I thought you would . " When it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with the notion that we should all lie on our backs , each of us making the petal of a flower , with our heads touching in the center and our legs pointed in seven directions , like this : He said we 'd be a living mandala and all the power of the trip and the music would be centered in us and give us an experience of spiritual union . It did . And there 's nothing I can say about it . I do n't know how to describe spiritual union in words . You 're not you . You 're everybody . And not just those who happen to be present . You 're everybody who ever lived or died . I don'tp153mean you 're brothers either . I mean you are them and vice versa . Even Percy the Cat seemed to feel the power of it . He climbed onto Nyoom 's stomach and laid there with his motorrunning and did n't even fart . The little tiny part of my mind that was still me felt safe and beautiful and holy and perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my body and joined the music at its source , and the source was  --  well , I suppose the word is God , but maybe I 'm jumping to conclusions . Anyway , I was getting a tremendous light show behind my eyes , too , an endless river of color and form flowing through the middle of my head and then spreading out , filling my entire body and extending even beyond it until there was nothing but this infinite river containing every form I could possibly remember or imagine , ivory columns , marble statues , perfect colors , fourth of July fireworks , faces , celestial landscapes , fishes , maps , abstract forms all in 3D and full color , masks , exquisitely carved images , mosques , fruit , animals , cathedrals , fantastic butterflies , serpents , birds , flowers  --  Icould fill pages and pages . It went on and on and I ca n't remember all I saw , because the flow was so constant there was hardly time to dig each thing separately . All you could do was groove on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every once in a while one of us said wow and I remember feeling absolutely certain each of us was tuned in on the same flow of images . But there 's no way of knowingfor sure . It went so fast you could n't compare notes . Somewhere along the way I had this thought that what I was seeing was the river of life . It was flowing through me and I was its banks . But now that I write it , it does n't look right . When the record ended , Cary Colorado said , " Does everyonehave his eyes closed ? " We all said yes . " Is everyone getting a light show ? " We all said we were.  |p154Then  he said , " Do n't change the record yet . I want to recite something from Demian . Is that cool ? Because it 's a very heavy thing . Would everyone like to hear it ? " Most heads tend to be Hermann Hesse freaks , so of course we were all delighted and urged him to go ahead . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was saying that the words sort of quivered out of him like cum , and yet the sound he made was strong and clear because he was seeing the truth of it all so thoroughly . I could n't concentrate on the full import of each thought , but later I got him to find it for me and now I 'll copy it here word for word as it appears in the book : If the outside world were to be destroyed , a single one of us would be capable of rebuilding it : mountain and stream , tree and leaf , root and flower , yes , every natural form is latent within us , originates in the soul , whose essence is eternity , whose essence we can not know but which most often intimates itself to us as the power to love and create . When Cary finished reciting , there was a long super-high silence . Then Archie Fiesta said , " Would it be cool to play the Doors ? I could dig Morrison right now . " Nobody answered . I guess the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooler at that moment than silence . ButArchie got up and put the Doors on , and we all lay there and listened . I felt myself gradually being brought down . We 'd been on a space flight and this was re-entry . The process was gentle and the rock beat was good but the overalleffect was sad and bitter and down-headed . Listening to Morrison , I felt I was hearing the song of Archie Fiesta 's soul . Can you give me sanctuary I must find a place to hidep155A place for me to hideCan you find me soft asylum I ca n't make it any more The man is at the door I felt someone stirring , so I opened my eyes to see who it was , and there was this strange woman standing there . Not a ghost either , but a real flesh-and-blood lady with great bosoms and enormous eyes , smiling at us . I was so surprised , my first reaction verged on freak-out . Then Cary said , " Doris ! " I was relieved to know it was n't a stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it when I 'm tripping I always imagine a straight person sees this big strobe-lighted sign on my face flashing , This Chick Is Doped to the Eyeballs , in psychedelic colors ? Ever since I got to New York , I 've been seeing practically everything with Mother 's eyes . I never used to do that at all , not even when I was living in the same house with her . But now I always find myself wondering what she 'd think if she could see me . I 'd like to get over this because it tends to turn everything sour . I do n't want to look at the world through the eyes of anyone but Witch Gliz  --  unless of course I chose to enter into somebody else 's trip , and I certainly would n't choose to enter Mother 's . Archie turned down the stereo and there was much huggingand kissing and everyone talked at once . Peter 's father had finally died . Then Peter and Doris had decided she should come back to New York alone while he stayed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father 's affairs . After my first big **51;12589;TOOLONG flash , I took a look at Roy . He was in a state of alarm , too . I guess we must have looked like Hansel and Gretel lost in the woods , because pretty soon Dorisp156noticed us standing there together and she smiled at us . Then Jeanette introduced us . By this time Doris had begun to look familiar to me . On acid you often seem to feel you knew everybody in some other incarnation . I said I wondered if we could have met before somewhere . She said , " I do n't know . But maybe it 's like they say , we 're all members of some ancient tribe , and we 're just beginning to know one another all over again . Anyway , you 're Witch , and you 're Roy , and I 'm Doris . " Her voice is wonderfully low with just a hint of gravel in it . She has enormous eyes with a lot of lid showing , and when she looks at you , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of us eyeballed one another for a while in a kind of sweet , profound silence . You 'd have thought she was on acid right along with the rest of us . I knew we liked each other . But Roy still looked scared , as if he thought there was still a good chance of being thrown out . Doris seemed to pick up on his fear , because after a few seconds , her mouth started to scrunch up like she was trying to keep it from melting . She loved him . She loved us both . But how could she ? How could she love us so ? How could we mean anything to her ? Then Roy 's face cracked open in the biggest smile I 've ever seen from him . The next thing I knew he was getting hugged against these great bosoms of hers , and I was having jealousy rushes . I guess she knew it  --  she seems to pick up on everything you 're feeling  --  because one arm reached out and grabbed me and then the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was getting something he needed and had n't had any of for about a million years , and I felt like I was getting earthmotherlessons from the number one expert of all time.  | A few minutes later , when Doris went up to unpack , Royand Jeanette and I followed her to the foot of the attic stairs , waiting for her reaction to all the work they 'd done up there . I . For a full minute there was n't a sound , and then all of asudden Doris let out a great ooh , followed by a whole series of them . And in a minute she started flying down the stairs until she saw us there looking up at her . Then she said , " Angels have been here ! Angels have been here ! " and her face was all wet with tears . So we all three went up while she raved about every little detail . I had n't lifted a finger up there , so I said , " It was n't me , it was Roy and Jeanette . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blowing her nose and wiping her eyes and frowning with the heavy import of it all . She said it was like a miracle . Spirits had come with magic wands of love and transformed her hovel into a palace . Roy was in Seventh Heaven . When Doris began to run down a little , he started pointing out exquisite details she 'd missed . For instance , he 'd painted the inside of Peter 's closet ! Doris thought that was sensational . She carried on about it as if no one in history had ever come up with such an innovation . Then Roy became modest . He said it was n't really that hard to do , but it was the sort of thing that often gets missed  --  unless a person is thorough . Everything he said for the rest of the trip seemed to be geared to pleasing Mama . He was making plenty of headway , too . Once , for instance , Doris stopped in the middle of a sentence and looked at him . " God , you 're adorable , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was talking about . After a while Jeanette went downstairs , but Roy and I stayed on . The three of us must have rapped for a good two hours at least , so I 'll have to leave out a lot . Roy wanted to know what Doris thought about his being in her house while he was hiding from the Army . She said the place was n't hers any more than it was his , since Peterp158paid the rent , but she did n't think Roy had anything to worry about on that score . Peter was rabidly anti-Pentagon and liked having opportunities to undermine it . All the talk was delicious . I wanted to go downstairs and get Nyoom 's tape recorder but Doris said she thought it might " put a crimp in our style . " Doris has a good rap , fast and wisecracky and warm . She uses all sorts of phrases I 've never heard before , but acid has a weird effect on my memory , so I 'm afraid I 'll miss a lot of them . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a late night TV talk show , an older chick that 's lived plenty and really knows where it 's at . Her face does great contortions when she 's making a point . She does n't wear make-up , but she 's sort of got make-up scars , as if she 'd just plucked her eyebrowsand cold-creamed all the paint away about five minutes ago and you can still see where it was . Also her hair is still half dyed ( reddish brown like Mother 's ) and half not . The real color is brown streaked with white . When it grows out , it 'll be like some real sneaky super-authentic $roo job from Elizabeth Arden 's . She 's tall , too , which I envy , and her body is full with these big cozy-looking boobs that 'd be terrific for crying on . ( With any luck , mine will be like that in a few years . ) C Doris was into a big plastic scene in Los Angeles when she first started going to Peter . That 's how they met  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beverly Hills , very appearance-conscious and ambitious ( Aries , moon in Capricorn , Pisces rising ) and spent a lot of her time in beauty parlors and fussing with clothes . Lots of things about her remind me of Mother , except that Doris broke out of it . No , that 's not true . She does n't really remind me of Mother . They 're not alike at all . It 's just that Doris is Mother 's age and came out of the same bullshit . Seeing how groovy she is makes me wish Mother could have been that way , too . One of the things she went to Peter for was to get helpp159with this losing battle she was waging with the calendar . She said by the time she got adjusted to being 20 she was 30 , and before she could dig being 30 she was 45 . ( Sally says Aries are often behind or ahead of themselves in time . ) Doris 's first marriage had given her ego a real beating . She said Peter had done wonders for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and helped her like herself a lot better . I noticed there was still a little residue though . She does n't dig her own feet . They 're sort of big and shapelessif you 're into a high fashion bag , and even though she 's out of all that now , she still has this tendency to hide her feet and make slighting references to them , as if they were ugly stepchildren . The one part of the conversation I 'd like to be able to capture here has to do with acid . Doris was n't too surprised to learn we were all tripping when she arrived . " I thought that ceiling was pretty high when I came in , " she said . " Well , how 's it all going ? Any bummers ? " She was sitting in one of the easy chairs with her feet tucked under her . Roy and Jeanette and I sat on the floor . We told her Archie had had a few problems but everybody else was having a peaceful trip . Roy asked her how she felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " it scares me to death . I 've had three trips myself and they were glorious . But awful things really do happen with it . Now look , sweetheart , are you sure you want to go into this now ? You 're tripping , and I do n't want to make you anxious . " She stopped to pull a piece of tobacco from her lip . Doris is nearly always smoking . I get the impression she 's addicted to Winstons . " I do n't know what I 'm worried about though , " she said . " You seem to be handling it great . How many trips have you had ? " Roy said he 'd lost count on about the 3oth trip . " Well , I guess you know what you 're doing by now , do n't you ? "  | " I think I do . But I 'd like to hear your feelings about it . " " Why , darling ? My expertise extends only to gin and tonic . Why should you listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well ! I 'm very pleased ! Now let 's see . Acid is two years old in my life , four years old in Peter 's . He 's tripped eleven times and once on peyote . Neither of us feels his experience is so impressive as to make him an authority on the subject . But we 've stumbled upon a few guidelines we follow . The guidelines , by the way , are for ourselves . We 're not out to convert , or to get anybody off the stuff . First  --  when to drop . " She looked at Roy and me . " How do you decide that ques-tion ? " I did n't know what to say . Roy told her he dropped acid whenever he thought it might be groovy . " I think that 's the way most younger people do it , but you 're braver than we are . Peter and I keep wondering about things like long-term effects , so we only take it when we feel we need it to stay high and keep growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass usually does the job . Peter , too . He says if we took acid just for that , it 'd be sort of like using a power crane to do the job of a shoe horn . " I asked her when she thought the power crane was called for . " If we feel really stuck in one spot and do n't seem to be moving at all ; it 's as simple as that . But first we exhaust every other resource we have , inside and out . Then , if we ca n't get things moving , it 's time for soul medicine , LSD , the great spiritual power crane . May I tell you how my first trip came about ? " We all squeaked and nodded and said please tell . " One afternoon I came to see Peter in a really awful state . This was before we got together . He was just my analyst at this point . Anyway , there I was , suicidal , weeping , hatingp161my life  --  I forget what the crisis of the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter stood up and came around the desk and stood next to me . He said , Mrs. O'Neill , do you suppose there 's any purpose to human life ? ' I was really knocked off balance . His whole mode and manner was different than I 'd ever seen it . Suddenly he was n't my doctor , he was just this person , this big terribly impressive man , and he was standingright next to me . He repeated the question , and I said yes , I supposed it had a purpose , but I had n't the vaguest notion of what it was . And he said , Oh , yes , you do , you have some notion . That 's how you 've gotten through it so far . You 've been riding some notion . Tell me what it is . ' I thought for a while , but I kept coming up with blanks . Then I asked him if he could put the question in another way . I could , ' he said , but it would n't help . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was getting annoyed but I was afraid to say so because I did n't want him to throw me out . Then he repeated the question . He said , What do you conceive to be the purpose of your life ? ' So just to shut him up , I said the first thing that came into my head , To save my goddam soul , I suppose ! ' I guess I expected him to be irritated , but he was n't at all . In fact it was perfectly obvious I 'd rung some kind of a bell . I could n't have been more surprised . He was nodding his head and knitting his brow . And then he said , Do you suppose you might have it upside down ? Do you suppose the purpose of your soul might be to save you ? ' I knew he was n't just playing with words either . He was dead serious . Bells went off in my head . I was learning something and I knew it was important , and by God I was determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time , since I was a little parochial school brat with chubby knees and a guilt complex , I thought that I , Doris , was supposed to take this messy little wreck , myself , and make something of her , make her into a Worthwhile Person . Save her soul , in other words . And now here was this great man , who happened also to bep162a hundred-dollar-an-hour psychoanalyst with qualifications up the iddy-wah , and he was asking me , in all seriousness , if I thought I might have the thing upside down . Maybe my soul was supposed to save me ! I worked the thought over in my head for a few minutes and then I asked the Big Question  --  How ? And at that precise moment Peter ceased being my analyst . He sat down and looked out the window and he said , I 'm not really sure how . ' I nearly flipped . My analyst was leveling with me . They do n't do that as a rule , you know . They have this code ! Anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me out to dinner . We talked till midnight . Mostly he talked , and I listened . Really listened . He said he 'd begun to discover there was a faculty in man that had fallen into disuse , and he had a sneaking suspicion it was the most important faculty of all . The soul . He said it was a constant in each person , the only constant , whether the person was aware of it or not  --  and it was there to run things , to be relied upon and consulted and to be made friends with . The following Sunday we took LSD together . We 've been together ever since , by the way , but that 's not my point . The point I 'm trying to make is that LSD is soul medicine . It 's like peyote , which is infinitely better and much harder to get hold of . It helps you get in touch with your own soul . That 's the only thing Peter and I use acid for . We do n't happen to think , as so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be popped into your mouth like a maraschinocherry every time you yawn . Peter researched the stuff , he read everything he could lay his hands on , Huxley , Leary , the works . And he 's convinced it 's a tool for releasing light into man 's consciousness , and that it 's just plain stupid to let in more light if you have n't already made good use of the light that 's there already . Now I do n't think either of us will be taking another trip until we 're convinced , really convinced , that our daily lives  --  the way we 're actually living  --  is already reflecting all the light we 've gained in thep163past . I realize full well of course and so does Peter that there are any number of adorable little hedonists with hair down to their butts who think we 're both too rigid on this point . They tell us pleasure is motive enough . Well , perhaps so , but then we 're right back to the shoe horn and the steam shovel . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a little help relaxing so you can enjoy pretty things like bed and food and music , puff on some grass ! Nobody worships the senses more than Peter , and I 'm in a position to know about that , my dears . He 's marvelous ! But I do n't want to spoil his pleasure rap for you . It 's one of his best and he loves giving it . He feels the senses are teachers . They make us more aware of who we are . Look , here 's something he wrote down under peyote . " Doris went over to the bulletinboard and came back with a note that had been pinned to it . She read it over to herself first and then read it aloud . " ' Learning the senses is learning to be an animal who is conscious . ' And blah blah , there 's some stuff here I do n't understand , and then it says , When a man becomes truly aware of all the subtle powers of the senses , a terrific magic enters his consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond all senses . ' Now that is hardly the manifesto of an old puritan who 's uptight about dope , is it ? It 's just that Peter has such a tremendous respect for it he does n't like to abuse it . His real hope is that a day will come when a great deal more is known about these things . By then , who knows , the whole world might be having mescaline every Sunday morning for breakfast instead of just going to church . Can you imagine an international sacrament that really packed a wallop ? Why , we might even stop blowing one another up ! " All these new thoughts were so exciting I asked Doris if she 'd mind if I ran downstairs and got my notebook . Shep164smiled , and then she laughed . And then suddenly she got terribly serious . She looked at me and held my face in her hands . " Good lord , how you frighten me , sweetheart . You listen so beautifully , and you make me feel like such an old fool . Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . I 'm just an old relic from the big-band days . I was weaned on Pepsi Cola and the dollar bill and God Bless America , ' and I 've made an awful mess of my life . For two years now I 've been happy , it 's true , happier than I 've ever been before  --  but I 'm no authority . Neither is Peter . We do n't know what the hell we 're doing , any more than you kids do . This is a whole new age we 're heading into , and nobody but nobody knows what it 's going to be . All we can do is dream and try and hope and flounder . And talk ! We can talk , ca n't we ? God , how we can talk ! Forever it seems . I love you both . I loved you both on sight . And now I 'm going to bed . "  |p165CANAL  STREET , MONDAY NOON , SEPTEMBER 22 , 1969Conversation with Roy : Roy : I 'm an escaped convict . No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , I 'm not .

OF THE SAME DAYI sometimes wonder what 's running my life . This afternoonI went tearing uptown on the subway , got off at Columbus Circle , ran all the way to Central Park J.C. , up to the third floor , and by two o'clock , there I was , out of breath , waiting for Contemporary History to begin , and wondering what other plans I had for myself that I had n't let myself in on yet . However , once there , I decided to make the most of it , observe H. Gliss in action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . The hour went by quickly . He gave a really interesting lecture on the Constitution , and there was not one word of hate-America in it . In fact , he praised the Constitutionso extravagantly you 'd have thought he was being paid by the State Department . Then he did something truly sly . He asked if anyone knew or could guess which of our old World War II allies had admired the American Constitutionso much he 'd copied it for his own country 's use . No one knew . No one could guess . Then he announced quietlyp169it was Ho Chi Minh . I got so caught up in what he was saying that once or twice I forgot who he was and why I was there . By the time class was over , I sort of liked him , and I began to realize I intended to go up and talk to him , which sent me into full panic . Especially since I did n't know what I 'd be saying to him . So ! While I was waiting to catch him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone else had left , I went up to him and asked permission to audit his class . Without actually lying , I made it sound like I was enrolled at the University . He asked me why I wanted to audit ; and I said I was interested in knowing why , if the Constitution was such a fabulous document , America was in such rotten shape , and I had a feeling I could probably learn that in his class . I thought it was a fairly mealy-mouthed little speech , but he actually got so excited by it he invited me for a cup of coffee in the cafeteria . Mostly I think he believed me , that I was really interested in government . But it was probably unusual for him to be sought out by students , so he was a little suspicious of me . Still , he kept on talking , answering all my questions , and every once in a while slipping in one of his own , like where do you live , and what 's your major . He even asked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in peace and love , but I did n't belong to anything  --  except the human race . Then he asked me if I believed in free love . I said I did n't know about any other kind , so he dropped the subject . Now I remember feeling a certain relief . I guess I knew even then he was having some ideas about what might happen between us . I suppose I kept them out of my mind because I wanted so much to keep them out of his . We talked for over an hour and then he said he had to catch the ferry . I said , " What ferry ? " " Staten Island . " " You 're kidding ! " I said.  | " No , why ? " " Because that 's where I 'm going . " Amazing , the things that come out of my mouth ! " You live there ? " he said . " No . Just visiting . " So I went with him . The ride was lovely . I saw the Statue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked , but not the whole trip . Sometimes we just looked at the water and at the other boats . I began to wonder what I 'd do when we got to Staten Island , but I decided to leave it to inspiration . For one brief moment I played the game of pretending we were a father and daughter who were really on their way home . Then I thought , I 've come this far . I 'm determined to see where he lives . " Does your wife meet the boat ? " I asked . " No , she 's in Pittsburgh , " he said . " The kids , too . We 're separated . " He did n't mention her again . I got the impressionthe subject was painful , but I could n't resist asking about " the kids . " " After all , they are my siblings and I felt I had some sort of a right . He pulled out his wallet and showed me a photograph . There are two , which means I have a half-sister Yi and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a long time he asked me if I had some special interest in children . I said I did . My sister , whose name is Marie , looks like our father , and she looks like him in a way that makes me realize I do , too . It 's in the bones ; we both have broad faces with sturdy cheeks and jaws . I 'm blond and my father has dark hair , and perhaps that 's why I had n't noticed before how similar we were . Marie is blond , too . And my brother , whose name is Andrew , is dark like our father , but I ca n't tell much else about him . In the photograph , he 's wearing a cowboy hat and most of his face is in shadow . Then I asked a dangerous question . I said , " Do you have any other children , or just these two ? " And while he wasp171thinking about the question , frowning and looking out across the water , I had to hang on to the railing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ask so many questions ? " he said . I tried to shrug it off lightly , but he kept looking at me with a certain smile he has  --  if you can call it a smile . Actually it 's just a way of holding his face ; he squares his jaw and lets his mouth wrinkle up on one side . " You do , " he said . " You ask many questions . " I told him I 'd always been inquisitive by nature . I said people often found my questions offensive , and I apologized . We were quiet for a while , and I thought , Why in the hell do n't I tell him he 's my father and get it over with ? At the time , I could n't come up with an answer . I just felt some awful danger in the situation . But now I do n't know what the danger was . Partly of course I wanted to see what kind of man he was , see how he behaved with a girl he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd treated my mother . If he knew I was his daughter , he 'd start acting like a parent , i.e. , phony , and I 'd never find out who he was . Apparently something in me really wanted to let him have the truth , because I kept saying dangerous things . Once , for instance , when he was looking at me like a woman ( I was coming back from the ladies ' room and he was watching me walk toward him ) , I felt a certain alarm about leading him on , and decided to look for some way of turning his thoughts about me in a safer direction . So I said , " You know something ? From far away , you look just like my father ! " " Your father ! " " Truly , you do ! " I said . " Exactly , in fact ! " He did n't seem to care much for the comparison , so I tried to make it more palatable . " My father was a very handsome man , so you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complimented . "  | " Really ! He was a wonderful man , too . Strong principles , and a terrific sense of  --  decency . You 'd have liked each other . You have everything in common . Except of course , he 's dead . And you 're very much alive . Listen , do you know what I 'd like to do ? I 'd like to cook for you some night . In fact , I 'd love to ! Would you let me ? " " You want to cook for me ? " " Yes ! " " Tonight ? " " Wonderful ! " " I thought you got a date ? " " That 's easy , " I said . " One little phone call . Okay ? Will you let me ? " " Okay . I let you cook . You know how , huh ? " " Mm , I used to cook for my father . " " Am I gon na hear about him some more ? " " No . I wo n't mention him again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " " I do n't know , maybe I do n't like that . " " Why ? I told you he was handsome . " " Maybe I like to look like me . " " You do ! " I said . " You look exactly like yourself . " Staten Island looks like small towns must have looked 40 years ago . Everything looks out of date . A stranger plunked down in the middle of it would never believe he was in New York City , especially not in 1969 . We drove for about ten minutes in his ancient Ford stationwagon and then turned down an old road lined with trees and into a driveway next to an enormous old wooden house . We got out of the car . Behind the house was a barn and the autumn remains of a vegetable garden , and all around the edges of the place were trees . In a place like this , I thought , I could finish my old dream . I could take offp173all my clothes and go naked into the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's a farm ! " I said . " You live on a farm ! " " I know I live on a farm . " He was smiling . " You like farms ? " " I love them ! But I 've never been on one before ! " " Come look . " He led the way to the barn . There was a hayloft without any hay in it , and several storage bins with potatoes and carrots and onions and apples in them . He handed me a basket . " You come to cook , " he said , " get vegetables . " While the stew was cooking , my father showed me every little corner of the farm . He has three and a half acres with lots of trees , a house with seven bedrooms , a big barn and two small ones , a chicken coop , twelve chickens , three ducks , two cats . As I inspected it all , I kept whispering to myself , " Witch , you are the farmer 's daughter ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could tell this farmer was n't used to having company . He was feeling the same things I feel when I let a special person read something I 've written . I read it with them  --  using their eyes . And that 's what Hank was doing . He was looking at his place through my eyes . Naturally , I let him know how wonderful I thought it was , and this fresh view of his kingdom brought him a great deal of excitement . Before dinner he had a second drink , which he said was unusual . He asked me why I did n't drink , and I said because it did n't make me high . " Me either , " he said , " but I like the fire . " He pointed at his chest and belly . Dinner was all right . There was no wine for the stew , but I used lots of garlic and lemon . I noticed something was depressing him , but I do n't think it could have been thep174food , because , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of it . For dessert the only thing I could find was some home-canned peaches in a little pantry off the kitchen . There must have been a dozen jars there . I asked him if it was all right to use them and he said , " No , " very decisively . Then he said , " You eat some if you want . Not for me . " Obviously , the peach discussion had made him even sadder . I suppose his wife had canned them in happier times , so I left them on the shelf and had bread and jam for dessert . It was dark outside now and very quiet . I felt as if we were way off in the country somewhere . My father 's mood became heavier and heavier until pretty soon the entire house was forlorn . I was tempted to try to bring the place to life by chattering , but something told me not to . I made coffee . He used bourbon in it instead of cream and kept sipping it in silence . Every once in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to invite an answer . " I 'm not a drinker . " " There 's no woman here any more . " " Sunset comes too soon . " " This place is big . " And he 'd look around the huge old dining room and out the window into the dark . The only time he looked at me was when he thought I was n't noticing . He liked my being there , but still I knew my presence made him feel awkward about himself . After one especially long silence , I said , " I like it here . " He looked around , using my eyes again . " It used to be better , " he said . I know he was talking about the days when his wife and Andrew and Marie were still with him . My father is an extremelyarticulate person  --  not in his speech but in his face and body . I knew what had happened between him and his family without being told . I ca n't be really sure , of course , but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my guesses about him and his life . Some of my guesses might have been set off by certain scraps of information that came out , but most of them are based on the feelings I couldp175see passing through him , especially in his eyes . When the liquor had relaxed something behind them , they became completely open and naked . And all the troubles that usually live in his forehead moved into these big brown show windows . Fifteen years ago , he 'd married one of his students . They 'd lived together in some awful Manhattan slum where they began to dream of a good life somewhere in the country . One day when the children , my brother and sister ( I love writing " my brother and sister " ) , were still small , they took a ride on the Staten Island Ferry and spent the afternoondriving around the island . The station wagon was probably new in those days . Anyway , they bought the farm and moved in , and somehow , after only two or three years , the dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching in the city and working the farm at the same time . I feel certain , too , that he began to expect too much from his woman and from the two children , that he 'd been really hard on them and had finally driven them away . And now he was full of loneliness and regrets and confusion and pride . It would be hard to guess which of those things was the most painful for him to bear . Probably the regrets and the pride . There must be something in me that 's terribly attracted to sadness . I suppose that 's sick and I wonder about it but I do n't really care . Yes , I do . I care . But I care more about the sadness . I have this tremendous desire to make it go away . I 've always known this about myself , but I 'd never experiencedit so sharply as I did just an hour ago at my father 's table . And it caused me to do something foolish . Really foolish . But I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick of being told by myself that I 'm foolish ! So cool it ! I am who I am . ) I got up from the table and walked around to my father and stood behind him . I put my hands on his bead , restedp176them on his forehead , and prayed that something in them would cause everything in his whole heart and mind and soul to be soothed . But in my eagerness to heal , I 'd forgottenthat this poor lonely beautiful man has a body , too , and that he could easily misunderstand my affection for him . And of course he did . Completely . After a few seconds , he took my hand and lowered it to his mouth and kissed it . And he kissed it in a way that caused me to realize I 'd made a really ghastly blunder . Then he stood up and pulled me toward him and pressed himself close to me and kissed me . Suddenly I found myself trembling and crying . I felt the most tremendous love for him , and at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created . It seemed hopeless . And while I stood there crying and trembling , I said  --  to myself , I think , or was it out loud ? I hope not  --  I said , God help me , what have I done ? And whether it was out loud or not , something in him heard me . He put one of his thumbs on my face and took some of my tears and licked them off . " Crying tastes good , " he said . But he was n't smiling , he was dead serious . " What you think I am ? " he said . " Some old man with the fire gone out ? I 'm forty-four years old , far from dead yet . I like to lick tears from a girl 's face . And that 's not all . I like to lie with them , too . Oh , boy , look at you , big surprise , huh ? Achl Come on . I take you to the ferry , crazy dumb chick . " He took out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the car . We drove in silence for a while . Then I said , " I was n't teasing you . Honestly I was n't . I like you an awful lot . I think you 're a wonderful man . I just did n't realize  --  how I was acting . " After a moment he looked at me . " How old are you ? " " Seventeen . " " Why you call yourself Witch ? " " It 'd take a long time to explain . " " Crazy name . I do n't like it . What 's your real name ? "  | " On my birth certificate it 's  --  well it 's complicated . I do n't use my real name . " He shrugged . Then he said , " You never have any experience  --  witha man ? " I tried to think what I might say , and how it might sound to him , and nothing seemed right . The reason is obvious to me now . Nothing would have been right  --  except the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even tempted to tell . So I kept quiet . At the ferry building , he stopped the car and as he reached past me to open the door , he said , " Good meal . " I said , " Thank you , and I 'm awfully sorry I  --  " " Why do n't you shut up ? " he said . I admitted that was a good idea , and then I kissed him on the cheek and got out . He drove away without looking at me . The father drove away without looking at his daughter . Why ca n't my mind stop playing with these simple facts ? Why ca n't I get it through my head that except for some meaningless accident of blood , this man and I are nothing to each other ?  |p178CANAL  STREET , WEDNESDAY , SEPTEMBER 24 , 1969Roy was n't here all day yesterday . I started out the day merely worried and ended up obsessed . I tried to work on some pornography for a while in the afternoon , partly to get my mind off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That worries me , too , because I 've got to come up with some way of making money . This afternoon Doris asked me where I thought Roy and Archie were . I tried to play it lighthearted and unconcerned . I said I supposed they were out on some mad adventure . Ha ha ha . ( When will I stop being such a phony ? ) Saying it out loud was the first time I 'd actually formed the thought  --  some mad adventure  --  and the words scared me . Not the words , but the possibilities that lurked behind them . When I 'm worried like this , my witch sense is none too reliable . It 's got too much imagination mixed up in it and all it does is present me with clammy little still photos from horror movies that could n't possibly be true . But why not ? This is the city where those movies take place ! Roy 's already had a knife aimed at his gizzard andp179one cooling off his throat simultaneously , and I personally have come within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prostitute . For all I know , he 's been mashed by Godzilla and turned into hambuSomeone 's coming up the stairs . Let it be him . Half an hour laterIt was . It was Roy . We 've had a talk and a hug and now he 's taking a nap . I 'm supposed to think everything 's okay . But I do n't . He does n't look right and he does n't act right . He 's all splotchy-looking and pale , and his eyes have disappeared . He 's not behind them . He said Archie had the use of a pad on Spring Street that belonged to some friend who 'd gone to California , and they 'd gotten hung up over there with " these people . " I said , " What people ? " " Just people Archie knows . " " " Roy , where are you ? You 're not behind your eyes . " " Oh , that 's only because I 'm asleep . The rest of me is sittingup talking to you , but I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better go join yourself on the bed . " I went upstairs with him , mother-style , plumped the pillow , fussed with the sheets . I said , " Roy , I hope we 'll do something together tomorrow . Because I 've been missing you something awful . " He said , " Okay , sure . " He got in bed and I tucked him in and kissed him . Then I thought what an icky female trick I 'd just pulled , beating him over the head with how much I 'd missed him , making him promise to spend tomorrow with me . I said , " Roy we do n't have to . I was just . . . But his eyes were closed , and I thought , Oh , Witch , shut up and let the poor kid sleep !  |p180CANAL  STREET , 7:10 P.M. , THURSDAY , SEPTEMBER 25 , 1969Peter is back and all hell has broken loose . I 've borrowed Jeanette 's typewriter so I can work fast . We 're having dinner at eight-thirty and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have a feeling this is going to be the most interestingevening since we arrived in New York . He got here at about five while Roy and I were out shopping , and the place has been in an uproar ever since . I 'm in an absolute panic to get it all written down . If events continue to pile up at the present rate , my autobiography is going to be the longest book ever written . Our first view of Peter Friedman could hardly have been more terrifying . He was in a rage , like a wild man . His eyes were shooting flames and his face was pure white , he was making violent noises with his hands by socking them together , and he was shouting at the top of his voice . He 's quite tall and his shoulders are massive . He has a high forehead with black wavy longish-but-not-long hair , and side/burns that are so full they 're semi-muttonchops . I do n't know whether or not to describe him as handsome . The word impressive seems more accurate . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magnificentsurprise . I 'd heard such fabulous things about him that I 'd been expecting some kind of a saint , and of course I did n't expect to like him at all . I was afraid on the surface he 'd be a real goody-two-shoes , peaceful and wise and sensible , but underneath there 'd be this terrible flaw that only I could see , and I 'd have to go around pretending I did n't . But it 's not like that at all . If he 's a perfect person  --  and I have a hunch he is  --  it 's not because he 's flawless but because he does n't hide his flaws . He digs himself . Cary Coloradoturned to me the minute the explosion was over and said , " Is n't he great ? He lets it all hang out ! " Roy and I were n't here for the worst of it . We 'd gone to Bleecker Street to get some fresh dill and watercress for dinner . This is Sally 's night in the kitchen , but since Peter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a sort of welcome feast . I was n't sure he 'd be able to appreciate it , with his father just freshly buried this morning , but it was Doris 's idea and she probably knows what he 'd like better than anyone else . Anyway , he was supposed to come flying in to JFK at four P.M. , so with the traffic and all we expected him about five-thirty . Somehow he got in earlier though , and Roy and I missed his arrival . I had to piece the story together from bits and scraps people told me later , mostly Jeanette and Doris . They were here for the entire movie . Apparently the actual arrival scene was very high . Peter was n't at all depressed . He even felt good about his father being dead . The old man had been a rabbi . His voice must have been stupendous . He had a big reputation as a cantor and was alwaysbeing asked to do his thing in other people 's syna/gogues for special occasions . He was also super-orthodox , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't dig the synagogue all that much . There had been a long strain between the two of them that ended in an uneasy truce a couple of years ago , but the deathbed scene was completely harmonious . The old man held out against taking morphine until the very last . Peter sat by the bed for days and days . He did n't even go to bed in all that time , just nodded off once in a while in the chair , and then he 'd wake up with the old man clutching his hand . Finally they had to give him injections because his mind started to go and nobody could stand to watch the suffering . Anyway , Peter came home in high spirits and full of love , and right in the middle of all the excitement the doorbell rang . It was three young men asking for Archie Fiesta . Nobody'dever seen them before . Archie was out , so they asked if they could wait for him . They looked like sharpies from Newark or somewhere , but they were n't unfriendly or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Doris went up to the attic . Peter wanted to unpackand lie down before dinner . While they were up there , Doris started to show him all the things Roy and Jeanette had done to improve the place , but Peter did n't seem to be listening . Doris asked if anything was bothering him . He said yes , those young men downstairs . So he got up and went right down to the big room in his stocking feet . Doris had a feeling something was going to happen , so she followed him down . The three strangers did n't stand up when Peter came in the door . He stood there and looked them over for a minute , and then he said , " I get the impressionyou guys are interested in scoring . " " The three guys looked at each other , then one of them said he guessed it was cool , and another one spoke up and said yes , they 'd been told they could score some crystals from Archie . Peterp183said , " Well , that 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of here this afternoon , so you might as well leave . " At this point he was still very calm , and when they left , he turned to Nyoom and Cary , who had come in to see what was happening , and asked very quietly if they 'd help him get Archie 's things together . Just as they were starting up the stairs , they heard some footsteps . And there was Archie , on the lower landing , lookingup . Peter said , " Did you see your friends on the street ? " Archie said , " Yeah , I did . " " Did you tell them to wait while you came up and got the stuff ? " " What stuff ? I have n't got anything " Everyone knew Archie was lying . Peter included . He said , " Oh , I see . It was just a misunderstanding , huh ? Come on up here , Archie . Let 's talk it over . " Archie said , " How was your trip ? " " How was my trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now they were both standing on the landing outside the Big Room . Peter gave Archie a push and said , " Get the fuck up those stairs . " Archie said , " What 's the matter , Peter ? What 's hap-pening ? " " You , shitheel , you 're what 's happening . You 're leading the way to your stash . It 's in your room , is n't it ? " " I have n't got anything in my room . I do n't know what you 're talking about . " They were on the second landing now , and Peter slapped Archie hard across the face . He said , " Go get it . Fast . " Archie went to his bedroom and lifted up the mattress . There was a little brown bag hidden under it . Peter reached in and pulled out a handful of small tinfoil squares . Then he dropped them all back into the bag , except one . He un/folded it and found about a quarter of a teaspoon of white powder . Peter said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is it ? " " Meth , " Archie said . " How long have you been dealing out of my house , motherfucker ? " " Never . I never dealt out of here , I swear . I was just goingto deal this one batch . That 's all I was going to do . Honest , Peter , I 'm telling the truth . " " Get out . " Then Peter started pushing Archie down the stairs . At this point Roy and I came in the street door downstairs . I was opening the door for Roy , because his arms were full of groceries , and when I opened it I saw Archie sort of fallingtoward us and this wild man shoving him from behind and raving like a lunatic . He kept saying , " Faster , faster ! You 're not moving fast enough . Move faster , you little prick , move faster . " When Peter saw us , he held Archie by the shoulders from behind . I suppose he thought Roy and I were two more speed customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Who are you ? " Roy could n't get his mouth together at all . I said , " I 'm Gloria . I mean Witch ! " And felt foolish for correcting myself . Doris called down from the top of the stairs , " They 're ours , Peter . Those two belong to us . " " All right , but stand aside ! " he said . " I 'm taking out the trash ! " Then he pushed Archie out the door and out onto the sidewalk and followed him out , hollering all the way . Archie ran over to a lamppost and sort of hid behind it . And whenp185Peter stopped hollering at him for a second , he said , " Can I have my stuff ? " Peter still had the brown bag in his hand . I had n't yet been told what was in it , and could n't even imagine . Peter acted like it was poison . He dropped it on the sidewalk and started to grind it with his foot . But he was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and came back toward the house . Roy and I got out of his way . He walked right past us and up the stairs . Roy looked at me and said , " Hey , that was Peter , was n't it ? " " I guess so . " Archie was down on his hands and knees , gathering up the contents of his brown bag . Roy said , " Archie , what 's happening ? " Archie was crying . " I just blew my scene , man . He threw me out . " " He found your crystals , huh ? " Things were happening so fast I could n't get it all togetherimmediately . But later I realized what was in the bag . And not only that  --  Roy knew . This fact kept hitting me all through dinner . ( But I 'm getting ahead of the story . ) Roy went over to Archie and said , " Please do n't cry , man , please . " Archie said , " I 'm not crying ! " But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was running so fast nobody could have caught him . Especially not Roy , with grocery bags in both arms . Now I 'm going to record what was happening in the house while Roy and I were downstairs on the sidewalk with Archie . Doris told me this part : Peter came up the stairs . Doris was waiting for him onp186the first landing . She said she did n't have any plan , she did n't know what to do . She was just being there for him . So Peter came up to the landing and looked at her . Then he looked down the stairs , and back at Doris again . She said his expression was so strange and distant she was actually frightened for him . He went into the Big Room walking like a stick man and everybody was standing around looking at him . A couple of them tried to smile , but his mood was so queer , no one knew what to say or do . Then he looked at Doris again and said , " What did I do just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he still was n't himself . " Tell me , " he said . " What happened here just now ? " Doris said , " Well , Peter , you put Archie out of the house . " " I threw him out , did n't I ? " " Yes , you did . We have a family agreement against hard drugs in this house . And against dealing of any kind . Archie broke them both . He broke our family agreements . And you put him out of the house . " I 'm not absolutely certain , but I think this is the moment Roy and I walked in on . Because when we did , Peter looked past us both without even seeing us . He went to the landing and looked up and down and up and down , and he kept saying , " Oh , Christ . Oh , Jesus . Oh , Christ . What did I do to the boy ? What did I do to him ? " He ran down the stairs and out onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running , and so of course he was gone by then . Peter came back up the stairs and looked at us for a minute . He was like a person waking up from a nightmare . He said , " I 'm sorry , I guess I just do n't know what I 'm doing . " And then he went up to the attic . Doris followed him up , but she came down a minute later and told us he wanted to be alone for a while , and we were to call him when dinner was ready.  |p187I  asked her if he was all right . She said , " I think so . He 's watching the seven o'clock news and that 's a good sign . Peter 's a news freak , you know . " She told me that even in California when his father was dying , he left the sickroom every evening to watch the HuntleyBrinkleyreport in the hospital lounge . " He says this is the only world he 's got , so he has to keep an eye on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see about dinner . It 's almost ready . The table looks beautiful . The whole place does . Nyoom brought some of Will 's plants from the greenhouse on the roof and arranged them in corners and on window sills . Cary built a fire . We still do n't need one , but it makes the whole room glow . I 'm awfully excited about the evening coming up . Peter 's presence in the house has changed everything . Even with all this disturbing Archie-drama fresh in everyone 's mind , we 're all feeling about twice as high as usual . Roy 's in the bathroom putting Clearasil on his pimples , and I noticed he 's wearing his special-occasion shirt , the blue madras Delano gave him . I suppose I 'd better stop now . My hair could stand a brushing . Hours later , about 1 : 30 a.m . I 'm alone in the Big Room , wide awake , full of new thoughts and feelings . The ashes are still warm in the fireplace , and there are a few live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this great long wooden table . Typewritersmake too much racket at night , so I 'm doing this by hand . I love the silence of New York nights . It 's a kind of roaring silence that you feel everyone in town is contribut/ing to even in their sleep . When you 're awake at these hours ( as I often am , writing or thinking or just lying in bed next to Roy ) you can actually feel all the foghorn tooters on the river and all the ambulance drivers and truckers and cops and burglars and whores keeping you company . It 's nice . It 's also a little creepy . But I like it . All evening I 've been getting flashes of some other time , some earlier century . I do n't know which one though . All pre-loth centuries seem pretty much alike to me  --  I suppose because none of them had electricity . Tonight the only light we used was firelight and people light , and I 'm still feeling the tremendous glow of all that 's taken place here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all seated at this table when Peter came in . He stood at his place at the head of the table for a minute , and then he said , " What about somebody else sitting here tonight ? " Nobody responded . Nyoom was sitting at about the middle place on the left side of the table . Peter said , " Hey , Nyoom , what about you ? Will you swap with me ? " Nyoom seemed delighted to have been singled out . He rose with a self-important frown and gave up his seat to Peter , then went to the head of the table and sat down . Now I was sitting across from Peter , and Roy was right next to him . Doris , who was at the opposite end , said , " Well ! That 's nice , to shuffle things up once in a while . Sally , why do n't you switch with me tonight . " Sally made a happy little game of it . She switched places with Doris , and that put Doris right across from Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when everybody 's plates were filled , Sally Sunflower extended her hands and said , " Zapp189time ! " We made a chain of hands around the table , and everyone closed his eyes . Then the current started flowing through us . It was the strongest hand-chain Zap I 'd ever experienced . At one point I took a peek at Roy to see how he was digging it . He had his fingers wrapped tight around Peter 's right hand and Jeanette 's left and I could see he was really impressed with the voltage coming through . His face was completely slack and his eyelids were fluttering . The first Zap is always for Will . Then Doris said , " Let 's send a Zap to Peter 's father . " After a few seconds Sally said , " My ex-grandmother in Las Vegas broke her foot . " The whole thing was getting so heavy I did n't want to waste it . I started thinking of all the people I knew who could use a Zap  --  my father in Staten Island , Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just as I was about to open my mouth , I heard Roy 's voice . When I think of it now , I 'm amazed at how strong and clear it was , because what he said must have taken guts , and it caused a good-sized shock wave to travel around the table . He said , " Should n't we send a Zap to Archie Fiesta ? " Peter said , " Yes ! " A few seconds later , as if on some inaudible signal , Zap time was over and everyone was busy eating and talking . I do n't know what I expected Peter 's mood to be now , but he seemed gentle and open and full of life . Doris told him Roy and I were sleeping in Will 's place under the stairs . He wanted to know if it was comfortable enough , and both Roy and I started raving at once about how perfect it was . Then he asked us where we were from , and whether or not our parents knew where we were . Roy looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they knew we were in New York , but we had n't given them an address . Then he looked at Roy and Roy looked back , terrified . He seemed to be steeling himself for a terrible blow . Maybe hep190thought he was going to get thrown down the stairs for lookingyoung . But Peter was n't even thinking about that . He said , " That white paint between the rafters up there fills the whole place with light . I ca n't get over the difference . Was that your idea ? " " It was Jeanette 's , " Roy said . " She picked the color . " Jeanette was pleased . " Roy swings a mean brush , " she said . Peter said , " I could tell it was a professional job . No big globs of drippage , no spilling over . What 'd you do , use masking tape ? " " No , I was just careful . " " " You must have a steady hand . " " I guess I do have a pretty steady hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Peter said , " Did you enjoy it ? " " I did , I really did . I just got behind it and dug it . That 's the way I am . I get right behind a thing , whatever I 'm doing , and I make myself dig it . Did you notice the skylight in the hall ? " " Did I notice it ? I noticed it first thing . Did you do that ? " " I thought it 'd be better to let the light in . So I just took out the wood and put in some glass . It does n't leak either . I tested it . I went up on the roof and threw water at it really hard , like a bad rain would do , and not a drop went inside . So it wo n't leak or anything either . " " I lack the patience for a job like that , " Peter said . " A craftsman has to have patience . What does your father do ? " " He 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , you know . " " Yeah , I know , but you quit , right ? " " Right . Is your father any good ? " Roy shrugged . " He gets a hundred dollars an hour . Sometimesa hundred and fifty . "  | " That 's not what I meant . " " You mean is he really good ? " " Yeah . " " I do n't know how to tell . " " What would be your guess ? " " I would n't go to him if I was freakin ' out . " " Why not ? " " If you want the truth , I think he 's sort of an asshole . I mean that respectfully . " Everybody laughed  --  except Peter . Then Roy continued , " I mean , I 'm not sure he listens . No . He listens all right . But he listens too fast . He thinks he knows what you 're telling him before you get it all out . And so what happens is you never get it all out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all , but he still does n't really know what 's happening . Only I guess he 's different with his patients . I do n't know how he is with them . I just know how he is with me . " " Have you spent a lot of time with him ? " " Yeah . Every other Sunday he 'd stay home in the afternoon and we 'd talk . He 'd ask questions and all , and I 'd answer him , sort of . " " Did n't you see him every day ? " " Not as a rule . He had all these patients from early in the morning till late at night . Saturdays , too , and once in a while on Sunday . But most Sundays he spent at the yacht club , except when we had our appointments . " " Appointments ? " " Yeah , they were like appointments . I guess he thought he ought to counsel me . Because that 's what our talks were all about , they were all about my getting counseled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't want him to know what was really happening , so I used to make up problems . Like , I 'd say , Gee , Dad , my mind wanders during geometry . Why do you suppose that is ? Then we 'd spend the hour get/Ling that all patched up , and I 'd have him off my back for another couple of weeks . " " Was he on your back a lot ? " " No , it was n't like that . What I meant was his conscience would be clear because he 'd been giving me all this counsel , you know what I mean ? " Peter nodded . " Yeah , I know what you mean . How do you feel about him ? Apart from thinking he 's an asshole . Do you like him at all ? " " Once in a while I feel sorry for him . I tried to turn him on to grass once but it did n't work . " " What happened ? " " I told him about this friend I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody like that , I made it up . Anyway my old man said this other father must be a very disturbed man . He tends to think everybody needs professionalattention . " " He knows you smoke grass ? " " He knows I have . But I told him I quit . " " Why ? " " I did n't want to be hassled about it . I know that 's no good . I should 've told him the truth , right ? " " I do n't know . " " You think it 's all right to lie to them ? Parents ? " " I do n't know , I really do n't . Seems to me there are times when a person does n't have any choice . It takes support to tell the truth . You got to have something behind you , somethingunderneath you , something to hold you together when the shit hits the fan . And if you do n't feel you 've got that , then you lie . " " I should 've had all that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where in the hell you 'd have gotten it  --  living at home . I was still lying to my father when I was thirty . Not that I 'm carrying any big regrets either . I did what I had to do and to hell with it . Now , of course , I feelp193differently about all that . I wo n't lie to people any more . Just to institutions . You know , the government , the telephone company , the Army . Institutions do n't have ears , so I just try to figure out what information works best  --  and feed them that . But people , I , uh , I just ca n't do that any more . I ca n't lie to people . I find it hurts me immediately ! I get immediately depressed by it . So I 've cut that out pretty much . " He 'd been addressing a lot of these remarks to all of us , but at the end he swung his face toward Roy and said , " What about you ? Do you still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I guess he 's an institution , is n't he ? " His face cracked a little , so Roy snickered . And Peter said , " But what about now ? Do you lie to your friends ? " Roy said , " I do n't think I do . What about it , Witch , do I lie ? " I said I thought he just lied to institutions and to people who acted like institutions . But never to me . Nyoom , who was having a ball playing Papa at the head of the table , picked up the subject of Archie . He said , " The episode earlier this evening , involving our pater familias and the , uh , erstwhile Mr. Tambourine Man , seems to presenta fascinating ethical problem vis-a-vis the question of the state versus the individual . " Peter said , " Tell us about it , Nyoom . " It took Nyoom several minutes to find phrases pompous enough to cover the matter . But finally , after a few other people thinned it out for me , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impertinent . He was saying that Peter had chosen to protect the household against Archie by throwing him out . Therefore , in his behavior he had actually sided with the state against the individual . But Peter was n't at all annoyed . He listened with perfect interest to the whole thing , even helped Nyoom find the right wording to make his point . Then Cary Coloradop194started defending Peter 's behavior . He said there was a revolutiongoing on , and Archie 's behavior had placed us all in jeopardy . In an ideal society  --  pure anarchy , with everyone governing himself  --  people would n't be going around shootingup hard drugs in the first place . Besides , he said , nothing would be illegal , so there would n't be any police breathing down everyone 's neck . Peter interrupted . " Now hold it , whoah , " he said , " now just wait a minute ! We 're going to have to have police , man ! Oh , yes indeed ! In these early stages of Utopia , a police force must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you see , for maintaining public health when people are found running around spreading contagious diseases ! " " Yes , " Cary said , " but that 's what you were doing  --  in a way . You were stopping the spread of a  --  " " Now please , man ! My behavior ca n't be justified ! Forgive it , please do , but do n't justify it ! You just can not have police behaving the way I behaved with Archie ! Throwing a boy down the stairs ? That 's sick ! " Doris said , " What do you suppose we 'd better do , arrest your ' " No . Let me off . My record 's good . Besides , you 've all rehabilitated me . I 'm peaceable now . But listen ! Think about this ! What 's to be done when men in high places act like I did ? Say they suggest warlike solutions to problems ? Wo n't those dangerous individuals have to be arrested ? Wo n't they have to be placed in isolation ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cary said , " What would we do with them , keep them in prison ? " " No , no , no ! Rehabilitate ! Rehabilitate ! And who knows , we may have to dedicate all the powers of science to the job  --  but that 's okay . Everybody 's worth the trouble . Everybody'sworth all the trouble in the world . Is there a kinder way  --  no , let me put it like this : Is there any other way at allp195to help carriers of the most virulent disease known to man ? I do n't know . I ca n't think of one . But you 'd better , you kids had better get at it , figure out how to handle this thing . It 's all well and good to toss peace signs around in the streets , but how you going to handle it when you 're running the world ? What are you going to do when some dear beloved brother goes berserk  --  like I did an hour ago , running around here like some Old Testament Jewish papa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once , including Doris . But Peter kept raving on , like a man in the grips of some wild , marvelous. obsession , and he was utter heaven the whole time . I adored him . " No , no , goddamnit , I 'm serious , " he said . " I realize I pay most of the bills around here , but please , for Christ sake , all of us have got to remember that what we 've got to form on this planet is a society where money does n't get any special privileges . Ideally , we do away with money entirely . But that 's not going to happen tomorrow , and it 's not going to happen next year . So we 've got to learn to live with money . And the first rule is Do n't let the moneyman get away with any shit . In the past , money was influence . But not here . All of us at this table are compatriots in the future . We 've got to do it right . And that means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angel . " Let me tell you what happened in California last week . I 'm sitting at my father 's bedside , holding his hand . I think he 's asleep , so I 'm just sitting there looking at him , thinking what a tough old fucker he was , and how maybe he would n't have had cancer if he 'd been just a little less hard-ass . If he had n't been right all the time , and so goddam sure of himself  --  well , I do n't want to get into that . I do n't know what cancer 's all about . Forget I said that . All I want to tell is what happened . I 'm sitting there thinking all this shit about him , when suddenly his eyes pop open and he 's look/ing straight at me , and he says  --  now get this  --  he says , You are my immortality . ' And then , quick as a wink he shuts his eyes again . And that 's the last thing I heard out of him . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very clear . From then on , he was on the way out . But that was the last thing he shot at me . He said , You are my immortality . ' " And let me tell you all something right this goddam minute . He was right ! He lives in me . . . . Who did you think that was this afternoon hollering his lungs out and throwing Archie Fiesta down those stairs ? It was n't Moses and it was n't Eddie Fisher and it was n't Dick Nixon . It was me . I am my father 's immortality . And I proved it here about an hour ago . So watch me ! This is exactly how the shit gets rolling in this world . The president of the United States drops a turd that burns millions of people , Asians and Americansalike , people  --  sacred human persons , dead and mutilated ! And what happens ? All his high-paid helpers , the Cabinet , the Chiefs of Staff , all the advisers , they sit around forever after , telling him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these fucking gooks , these slanty-eyed Communist farmers try to run their own country and cause all this troublefor our president . He means well ! He 's trying to protect us ! So the fuck what ? He 's still out of his goddam mind , is n't he ? Bullshit . I 'm not getting into that act . I 'd rather have Archie and every little speed freak in Manhattan descendupon this place and burn it to the ground . " By the way , " he said , " is Archie a speed freak ? " Everyone looked at everyone else . Roy said , " You mean is he shooting speed ? Or is he strung out on it ? Because a speed freak is somebody that 's strung out on it , is n't it ? " " Well , either way , " Peter said . " What I 'm wondering is what shape Archie 's in . That 's what I should have been thinking about when I found that shit in his room . Was he just selling it ? Or is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He put the question to Roy.  |p197Roy  got flustered . It looked pretty obvious to me , probablyto Peter , too , that Roy knew something . Nyoom said , " I get the impression Roy would like to invokethe dictum of , I think it might have been John Lennon or one of the Beatles , who , when asked by the press if some other famous personage was a marijuana smoker , simply said , I think everyone has a right to blow his own cool . And perhaps he has a point . Because you see  --  " " Nyoom , " Peter said , " let me interrupt , may I ? " " I relinquish the floor . " " You just said something that strikes me as very serious , if I understood you right . You think Roy does n't want to rat on Archie . Right ? " " Very succinct ! " " Mm-hrn . And you know what that means ? That means I 'm the fuzz in this situation . " Nyoom spoke up quickly . " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did , Nyoom . " Then he put his arm on Roy 's shoulder and spoke softly . " Listen , son , how could I blame you ? The first time you lay eyes on me an hour ago , what am I doing ? I 'm performing a raid , making a bust . Naturally you see me as someone to protect your friends from . In your shoes , I 'd be doing the same thing , and for the same reasons . Furthermore , I admire you for it . " " Perhaps , " said Nyoom , " there is still another reason for which Roy is disinclined to share information about Archie 's , um , shall we say , habits . " " Shit ! " said Jeanette . Her eyes were all a-snap with black anger . She looked marvelous . " Nyoom baby , I 'm gon na tell you something . Your mouth thinks too much ! " Then Doris spoke . " Let 's have a quiet moment now . Shall we ? " Sally Sunflower , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly bloomed again . " Oh , yes , " she cried . " Let 's ! "
