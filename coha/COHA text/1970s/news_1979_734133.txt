txt Passage of the state 's $12.6 billion budget was blocked last night when the State Senate voted to eliminate Medicaid money to finance abortions for poor women and the Asssembly refused to do so . The adoption of the antiabortion amendment in one house but not the other created an impasse that will leave New York State ? already in the third day of its new fiscal year ? without a budget for at least several days more . The state will be unable to pay some its bills , provide any aid to local governments or enter the credit markets for its mammoth $3 billion spring borrowing until it has one . After hours of searing debate , the Senate approved the antiabortion ammendment 33 to 26 . The Assembly voted it down , 75 to 70 , then wentork to defeat a handful of other amendmentsand finally passed the local-assistance budget by a vote of 90 to 53 before adjourning . Early this morning , the Senate passed the localassistance budget , 38 to 21 , approved the capital-construction , debt-service and judicial budgets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only sticking point as the Republican-led Senate and the Democratic-led Assembly reached accord on the other details of the budget , including increases of $185 million in state education aid and $87 million // in localities that are assisted by revenue . sharing . The budget also included major cuts in Governor Carey 's proposals for Mental Health , correction and the judiciary . In addition , the legislative leadership quietly brought forward a last-minute bill to raise the salaries of judges , top executive employees and legislators . However , the bill is not scheduled to be acted upon until at least later today . But the Medicaid-abortion issue overshadowed all other considerations as the the Assembly and the Senate engaged in loud , lengthy and emotional debates over budget amendments that would bar Medicaid funding for abortions except in cases where the woman 's life was in danger or in instances of rape or incest . As the Legislature worked early into the morning , it remained unclear how the impasse would be resolved , with both sides appearing willing to wait it out . But the closeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitute a majority , and where an effort to convince . Senators to release the budget eventually succeeded last year ? suggested that pressure would be concentrated there . Antiabortion lobbyists said they believed they had a chance of succeeding in the Assembly , but this seemed less likely . The debate reflected the strength of feeling on the question , which last year left the state without a budget for nearly a week . " Will this government go on financing the killing of its future citizens ? It 's as simple as that , " said Senator James H. Donovan , Republican-Conservative of Chadwicks and the leading Senate sponsor of the antiabortion amendment . " They seem to know the cost of everything and the value of nothing , " Mr. Donovan said of advocates of Medicaidabortion financing . " God help us if we do n't turn this thing around soon , because the anti-life people have conquered the nursery and perhaps the next step is the geriatric ward . " " Is it their right to foist upon those of us who disagree with their doctrine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Roy M. Goodman , a Manhattan Republican . " Let us rise at this time and defeat this vicious amendment , " which he said constituted " cruel and inhuman punishment for poor women . " Overall , the budget was somewhat smaller than the one Mr. Carey had proposed and was finally agreed to last week after six weeks of grueling negotiations . It included the following key provisions . 9$186 million increase in aid to school districts around the state . The increase was $20 million less than Mr. Carey had proposed , but provided that no district in the state will lose operating aid . Mr. Carey had asked for a package that would have shifted funds from rich to poor districts , and left some of the state 's wealthier districts with no state aid at all . The new package placated the wealthy districts that saw their aid returned , but enraged some poorer districts . These districts ? whose legislators tried unsuccessfully to amend the budget bills last night ? will receive increases under the plan , but less than Mr. Carey wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fight to reduce state revenue sharing aid to localities ? the least restrictive form of assistance . On the one hand , the Legislature restored $87 million Mr. Carey wanted to take away from local governments . But under a new formula , the revenue-sharing pool will grow much more slowly in the future . CAmong the most serious cuts made in the budget were reductions affecting the Department of Mental Hygiene ? which got $31 million less than Mr. Carey had asked for ? along with the Division for Youth , which saw its budget reduced by $5.6 million , to $97.8 million , and the Department of Correction . Proposed Pay Raises The legislative , executive and judicial pay raises were not expected to be considered until later in the year . The proposed raises would give legislators an eventual increase of about 90 percent , from $23,500 a year to 32,960 by Jan. 1 , 1983 . However , the legislators ' increases would not go into effect until 1981 . The Governor had proposed that the executive pay raises be linked to legislation requiring strict financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later in the legislative session ? if at all . The pay raises for 115 top-executive employees and for all state judges except for those at the town and village level involve a 7 percent increase retrocatctive to last October , and 7 percent this coming October . Judges would receive an additional 3.5 percent by October 1980 , and county and city judges would receive an additional increase to bring them into line with other members of the judiciary .
