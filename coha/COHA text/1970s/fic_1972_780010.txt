 | finished for him . " It would n't hurt in the slightest if he had a falling out with the King . " " Not the slightest , " Rdenrundt echoed , and showed me all of his teeth again . I was beginning to dislike him intensely . If this was the front man Angelina had ( picked for her operation , then he was undoubtedly the best one for the job on the planet . But he was such a puffed-up crumb , with barely enough imagination to appreciate the ideas Angelina was feeding him . Yet I imagine he had the money and the title  --  and the ambition  --  which combination she had to have . Once more I wondered where she was . Something carne in through the door and I recoiled , thinking the war was on . It was only a robot , but it made such a hideous amount of hissing and clanking that I wondered what was wrong with it . The Count ordered the ghastly thing to wheel over the bar , as it turned away I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one shoulder . There was the distinct odor of coal smoke in the air . " Does that robot burn coal ? ? " I gurgled . " It does , " the Count said , pouring us out a pair of drinks . " It is a perfect example of what is wrong with the Freiburian economy under the gracious rule of Villelm the Incompetent . You do n't see any robots like this in the capital ! " " I should hope not , " I gasped , staring bug-eyed at the trickle of steam escaping from the thing , and the stains of rust and coal dust on its plates . " Of course I 've been away a long time . . . things change ... " " They do n't change fast enough ! And do n't act galactic-wise with me , Diebstall . I 've been to Misteldross and seen how the rubes live . You have no robots at all  --  much less a contraption like this . " He kicked at the thing in sullen anger and it staggered back a bit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to straighten it up . " Two hundred years come next Grundlovsday we will have been in the League , milked dry and pacified by them ? and for what ? To provide luxuries for the King in Freiburbad . While out here we get a miserable consignment of a few robot brains and some control circuitry . We have to build the rest of the inefficient monsters ourselves . And out in the real sticks where you come from they think robot is a misspelling of a boat that goes with oars ! "  | He drained his glass and I made no attempt to explain to him the economics of galactic commerce , planetary prestige , or the multifold levels of intercommunication . This lost planet had been cut off from the mainstream of galactic culture for maybe a thousand years , until contact had been reestablished after the Breakdown . They were being eased back into the culture gradually , without ally violent repercussions that might upset the process . Sure , a billion robots could be dumped here tomorrow . What good would that do the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control units and let the locals build the things for themselves . If they did n't like the final product they could improve the design instead of complaining . The Count of course did n't see it this way . Angelina had done a nice job of playing upon his prejudices and desires . He was still glaring at the robot when he leaned forward and suddenly tapped a dial on the thing 's side . " Look at that ! " he shouted . " Down to eighty pounds pressure ! Next thing you know the thing will be falling on its face and burning the place down . Stoke , you idiot  --  stoke ! ! " A couple of relays closed inside the contraption and the robot clanked and put the tray of glasses down . I took a very long drag on my drink and enjoyed the scene . Trundling over to the fireplace ? at a slower pace now I 'll admit  --  it opened a door in its stomach and flame belched out . Using the coal scoop in the pail it shoveled in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rich black smoke boiled from its chimney . At least it was housebroken and did n't shake out its grate here . " Outside , dammit , outside ! " the Count shouted , coughing at the same time . The smoke was a little thick . I poured another drink and decided right then that I was going to like Rdenrundt . I would have liked it a lot better if I could have found Angelina . This whole affair bore every sign of her light touch , yet she was nowhere in sight . I was shown to a room and met some of the officers on the Count 's staff . One of them , Kurt , a youth of noble lineage but no money , showed me around the grounds . The place was a cross between a feudal keep and a small town , with a high wall cutting it off from the city proper . There appeared to be no obvious signs of the Count 's plans , outside of the number of armed retainers who lounged about and practiced uninterestedly in the shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true  --  yet I had been brought here . That was no accident . I tried a little delicate questioning and Kurt was frank with his answers . Like a lot of the farcountry gentry he bore a grudge against the central authorities , although he would of course never have gotten around to doing anything about it on his own . Somehow he had been recruited and was ready to go along with the plans , all of which were very vague to him . I doubt if he had ever seen a corpse . That he was telling me the truth about everything was obvious when I caught him in his first lie . We had passed some women and bent a knee , and Kurt had volunteered the advice that they were the wives of two of the other officers . " And you 're married too ? " I asked . " No . Never had the time , I guess . Now I suppose it 's too late , at least for awhile . When this whole business is over and life is a little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " How right , " I agreed . " What about the Count ? Is he married ? I 've been away so many years that it 's hard to keep track of that kind of thing . Wives , children and such . " Without being obvious I was watching him when I asked this , and he gave a little start . " Well . . . yes , you might say . I mean the Count was married , but there was an accident , he 's not married now . . . " His voice tapered away and he drew my attention to something else , happy to leave the topic . Now if there is one thing that always marks Angelina 's trail it is a corpse or two . It took no great amount of inspiration to connect her with the " accidental " death of the Count 's wife . If the death had been natural Kurt would not have been afraid to talk about it . He did n't mention the topic again and I made no attempt to pump him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in sight  --  but her spoor was around me on all sides . It was just a matter of time now . As soon as I was able to , I would shake Kurt and hunt up the bullyboys who had spirited me out of the jail . Buy them a few drinks to assure them that there were no hard feelings about the beating they had given me . Then pump them adroitly about the man who had led them . Angelina made her move first . One of the coal-burning robots came hissing and clanking around with a message . The Count  | would like to see me . I slicked my hair , tucked in my shirt and reported for duty . I was pleased to see that the Count was a steady and solitary daytime drinker . In addition , there was very little tobacco in his cigarette ; the sweet smoke filled the room . All this meant he was due for early dissolution , and I would not be numbered among his mourners . None of this showed in my expression or attitude of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Is it action , sir ? Is that why you sent for me ? " I asked . " Sit down , sit down , " he mumbled , waving me towards a chair . " Relax . Want a cigarette ? " He pushed the box towards me and I eyed the thin brown cylinders with distaste . " Not today , sir . I 'm laying off smoking for awhile . Sharpening up the old eye . Keeping the old trigger finger limber and ready for action . " " The Count 's mind was occupied elsewhere and I doubt if he heard a word I said . He chewed abstractedly at the inside of his cheek while he looked me up and down . A decision finally struggled up through his half-clotted brain . " What do you know about the Radebrechen family ? " he asked , which is about as exotic a question as I have ever had thrown at me . " Absolutely nothing , " I answered truthfully . " Should I ? " " No . . . no . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chewing his cheek . I was getting high just from breathing the air in the room and I wondered how he was feeling . " Come with me , " he said , pushing over his chair and almost falling on top of it . We plodded through a number of halls deeper into the building , until we came to a door , no different from the ones we had passed , except this one had a guard in front of it  --  a rough-looking brawny type with his arms casually crossed . Just casual enough to let his fingers hang over his pistol grip . He did n't budge when we came up . " It 's all right , " the Duke of Rdenrundt said , with what I swear was a peevish tone . " He 's with me . " " Got ta search him anyway , " the guard said . " Orders . " More and more interesting . Who issued orders the Count could n't change  --  in his own castle ? As if I did n't know . And I ire ognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who had taken  | me from my prison cell . He searched me quickly and efficiently , then stepped aside . The Count opened the door and I followed him in , trying not to tread on his heels . One thing about reality  --  it is always so much superior to theory . I had every reason to believe that Angelina would be here , yet it was still a healthy shock to see her sitting at the table . A kind of electric charge in my spine tingled right up to the roots of my hair . This was a moment I had waited for for a very long time . It took a positive effort to relax and appear indifferent . At least as indifferent as any healthy young male is in front of an attractive package of femininity . Of course this girl did n't resemble Angelina very much . Yet I still had no doubt . The face was changed as was the color of the hair . And though the . face was a new one it still held the same sweet , angelic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I remembered it , with perhaps a few slight improvements . Hers was a surface transformation , with no attempt at being as complete as the one I had had done to me . " This is Gray Bent Diebstall , " the Count said , fixing his hot and smoky little eyes on her . " The man you wanted to see , Engela . " So she was still an angel , though under a different name . That was a bad habit she should watch , only I was n't going to tell her . A lot of people have been caught by taking an alias too similar to their old one . " Why thank you , Cassitor , " she said . Cassitor indeed ! I 'd look unhappy too if I had to go through life with a handle like Cassitor Rdenrundt . " It was very nice of you to bring Grav Bent here , " she added in the same light and empty voice . Cassi must have been expecting a warmer welcome because he stood first on one foot and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Angelina-Engela 's welcome stayed at the same temperature , or perhaps dropped a degree or two as she shuffled some papers on the table in front of her . Even through his fog the Count caught on and went out mumbling something else under his breath that I was pretty sure was one of the shorter and more unwholesome words in the local dialect . We were alone . " Why did you tell all those lies about being in the Stellar Guard , " she asked in a quiet voice , apparently still busy at the  | papers . This was my cue to smile sardonically , and flick some imaginary dust from my sleeve . " Well I certainly could n't tell all those nice people what I 've really been doing all these years I have been away , could 1 ? " I responded with wide-eyed simplicity . " What were you doing , Bent ? " she asked and there was n't a trace of any emotion in her voice . " That 's really my business , is n't it , " I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while we 're asking questions , I would like to know who you are , and how come you seem to throw more weight around than the great Count Cassitor ? " I 'm good at playing this kind of guessing game . But Angy was just as good and dragged the conversation back to her own grounds . " Since I am in the stronger position here , I think you 'll find it wise to answer my questions . Do n't be afraid of shocking me . You would be surprised at the things I know about . " No , Angelica love , I would n't be surprised at all . But I could n't just tell all without a little resistance . " You 're the one behind this revolution idea , are n't you , " I said as a statement , not a question . " Yes , " she said , laying her cards on the table so she could see mine . " Well if you must know then , " I said , " I was smuggling . It is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where . For a number of years I found it was a most lucrative business . Finally though , a number of governments felt I was giving them unfair competition , since they were the only ones allowed to cheat the public . With the pressure on I returned to my sluggish native land for a period of rest . " Angel-mine was buying no sealed packages and gave me an exhaustive cross-examination into my smuggling career that showed she had more than a passing knowledge of the field herself . I had of course no trouble answering her questions , since in my day I have turned many a megacredit in this illegal fashion . The only thing I was afraid of was making it too good , so I described a career of a successful but still young and not too professional operator . All the time I was talking I tried to live the role and believe everything I said . This was a crucial time when I must let drop no hints or mannerisms that might bring Slippery Jim diGriz to her mind . I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still on my way up in the universe . Mind you  --  our talk was of course all most casual , and carried on in an atmosphere of passing drinks and lighting cigarettes all designed to relax me enough to make a few slips . I did of course , slipping in a lie or two about my successes that she would catch and credit to boyish enthusiasm . When the chit-chat slowed I tried a question of my own . " Would you mind telling me what a local family named Radebrecheii has to do with you ? " " What wakes you ask ? " she said so calm and coolly . " Your smiling friend Cassitor Rdenrundt asked me about them before we came here . I told him I knew nothing . What 's their connection with you ? " " They want to kill me , " she said . " That would be a shame  --  and a waste , " I told her with my best come-hither grin . She ignored it . " What can I do about it ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem interested in my masculine attractions . " I want you to be my bodyguard , " she said , and when I smiled and opened my mouth to speak she went on , " and please spare me any remarks about how it is a body you would like to guard . I get enough of that from Cassitor . " " All I wanted to say was that I accepted the position , " which was a big lie because I had had some such phrase in mind . It was hard to stay ahead of Angelina and I must n't relax for an instant I reminded myself again . " Just tell me about the people who are out to kill you . " " It seems that Count Rdenrundt was married , " Angelicious said , toying with her glass in a simple , girlish way . " His wife committed suicide in a very stupid and compromising manner . Her family ? who are of course the Radebrechen  --  think I killed her , and want to revenge her supposed murder by killing me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vendetta still has meaning , and this family of rich morons still subscribe to it . " All at once the picture was getting clearer . Count Rdenrundt  --  a born opportunist  --  aided his noble fortunes by marrying the daughter of this family . This must have worked well enough until Angelina came along . Then the extra wife was in the way , and ignorant  | of this charming local custom of revenge-killing , Angelina had removed a stumbling stone . Something had gone wrong  --  probably the Count had bungled , from the look of the man  --  and now the vendetta was on . And my Angel wanted me to interpose my frail flesh between her and the killers . Apparently she was finding this retarded planet more than she had bargained for . Now was the time for me to be bold . " Was it suicide ? " I asked . " Or did you kill her ? " " Yes , I killed her , " she said . The sparring was over and all our cards were on the table . The decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ? I had n't come this far , getting myself shot , bashed on the head and well-stomped , just to arrest her . I mean I was going to arrest her , of course , but it was next to impossible in the center of the Count 's stronghold . Besides that , I wanted to find out a bit more about the Count 's proposed uprising , since this would certainly come within the jurisdiction of the Special Corps . If I was going to reenlist I had better bring along a few prizes to show my good intentions . Anyway  --  I was n't so sure I wanted to reenlist . It was a little hard to forget that scuttling charge they had tried to blow up under me . The whole thing was n't so simple . There were a lot of things mixed up in this . One fact being that I enjoyed Angelina and most of the time I was with her I forgot about those bodies floating in space . They returned at night all right and chopped at my conscience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they could get through and bother me . Life was a bed of roses , and I might as well enjoy it before the blossoms withered . Watching Angelady at work was a distinct pleasure , and if you stood my back to the wall and made me swear , I would be forced to admit that I learned a thing or two from her . Singlehandedly she was organizing a revolution on a peaceful  | planet  --  and it stood every chance of succeeding . In my small way I helped . The few times she mentioned a problem to me I had a ready answer and in all the cases she went along with my suggestions . Of course I had never toppled governments before , but there are basic laws in crime as in everything else , and it is just a matter of application . This did n't happen often . Most of the time during those first few weeks I was a plain bodyguard , keeping a wary eye out for assassins . This position had a certain ironical angle that appealed to me greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Insurrection , and his name was fldenrundt . I never heard much , but from a word caught here and there 1 began to see that the Count was n't really cut o u t to he a revolutionary . The closer we came to the day the more pallid he became . His little physical vices began to add up , and one day the whole thing came to a head . Angelegant and the Count were in a business session and I sat in the anteroom outside . I shamelessly eavesdropped whenever I could , and this time I had managed to leave the door open a crack after I had checked her into the room . Careful manipulation with my toe opened it a bit more until I could hear the murmur of their voices . An argument was progressing nicely  --  there were a lot of them at this time  --  and I could catch a word here and there . The Count was shouting and it was obvious that he would n't give in on some simple and necessary piece of blackmail to advance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I could n't hear his words , strain as I might . There was a saccharine wheedle and whine in his voice , and Angelina 's answer was clear enough . A loud and positive no . His bellow brought me to my feet . " Why not ? It 's always no now and I 've had enough of it ! " There was the sound of tearing cloth and something fell to the floor and broke . I was through the door in a single bound . For a brief instant I had a glimpse of a struggling tableau as he pulled at her . Angelina 's clothing was torn from one shoulder and his fingers were sunk into her arms like claws . Clubbing my pistol I ran forward . Angelina was a bit faster . She pulled a bottle from the table and banged it into the side of his head with neat efficiency . The Count dropped as if he had been shot . She was pulling up her torn blouse when I came roaring to a halt . " Put the gun away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a calm voice . I  | did , but only after making sure the Count was really out , hoping an extra slam might be needed . But she had done a good job . When I stood up Angelina was already halfway out of the room and I had to run to catch up with her . The only other thing she said was " Wait here , " when she steamed into her room . It took no great power of divination to see that there was trouble coming  --  if it had n't already arrived . When the Count came to with a busted head he would undoubtedly have some second thoughts about Angelina and revolutions . I thought on these and related subjects while I matched coins with the guards . A few minutes later Angelina called me in . A long robe covered her arms so the bruises he had made were n't visible . Though outwardly composed there was a telltale glint in her eyes that meant she was doing a slow burn . I spoke what was undoubtedly the uppermost thought in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Count joins his noble ancestors in the family crypt ? " She shook her head no . " He still has his uses . I managed to control my temper  --  so you had better hold yours . " " Mine 's in great shape . But what makes you think you can still get work or cooperation out of him ? He 's going to have an awful sore head when he comes to . " Minor factors like this did n't bother her ; she dismissed the thought with a wave of her hand . " I can still handle him and make him do whatever I want  --  within limits . The limitations are his own natural abilities , which I did n't realize were so slight when I picked him to head this revolt . I 'm afraid his cowardice is slowly destroying any large hopes I might have had for him . He will still have value as a figurehead and we must use him for that . But the power and decisions must be ours . " " I was n't being slow , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I answered . " Just what is this we and ours business ? Where do I fit in ? " Angelilith leaned back in her chair and tossed a lock of her lovely golden hair to one side . Her smile had about a two thousand volt charge and was aimed at me . " I want you to come in with me on this thing , " she said with a voice rich as warm honey . " A partnership . We 'll keep the Count of  | Rdenrundt out in front until the plan succeeds . Then eliminate him and go the rest of the way ourselves . Do you agree ? " " Well , " I said . Then with brilliant inspiration , " Well . . " again . For the first time in a lifetime of verbal pyrotechnics I found the flow shut off . I paced the room and pulled my scattered wits together . " I hate to look a gift rocket in the tubes , " I told her , " nevertheless  --  why nw ? A simple but hard working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the cause and look forward to the restoration of his stolen lands and title . How come the big jump from office hey to board chairman ? " " You know better than to ask that , " she said and smiled , and the temperature of the room rose ten degrees . " I think you can handle this job as well as I can , and enjoy doing it . Working together , you mid I will make this the cleanest revolt that ever took over a planet . What do you say ? " I was pacing behind her as she talked . She stood up and took me by the arm , stilling my restless walking . I could feel the warmth of her fingers burning through my thin shirt . Her face was in front of me , smiling , and her voice pitched so low that I barely heard it . " It would be something , would n't it . You and I . . . together . " Would n't it ! There are occasions when words ca n't say it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time like that . Without physical deliberation my arms were around her , pulling her to me , my mouth pushing down on hers . For the briefest of instants she was the same , her arms tight on my shoulders , her lips alive . Just for a sliver of time so brief that afterwards I could n't be sure that I had n't imagined it . Then the warmth was suddenly drained away and everything was wrong . She did n't fight me or attempt to push back . But her lips were lifeless under mine and her eyes open , looking at me with a sterile emptiness . She ' did nothing until I had dropped my arms and stepped away , then she seated herself stiffly in the chair again . " What 's wrong ? " I asked not trusting myself to say more . " A pretty face  --  is that all you think of ? " she asked , and the words seemed pulled from her in sobs . Expressing real emotions did n't come easily with her . " Are you men all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " I shouted , angered in spite of myself . " You wanted me to kiss you  --  do n't deny it ! What changed your mind ? "  | ' Would you want to kiss her ? " Angelina screamed , torn by emotions I could n't understand . She pulled at a thin chain around her neck . It snapped and she half threw it at me . There was a tiny locket on the chain , still warm from her body . It had an imageenlarger in it , and when held at the right angle the picture inside could be seen clearly . I had the chance for only a single glimpse at the girl in the photograph , then Angelina changed her mind and pulled it away , pushing me towards the door at the same time . I t slammed behind me and I heard the heavy safety bolts thud home . Ignoring the guard 's raised eyebrows I stamped down the hall to my own room . My emotions had triumphed nicely over my powers of reason , and apparently Angelina 's had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand her cold withdrawal or the significance of the picture . Why did she wear it ? I had only had a single glimpse of the contents but that was enough . It was the photo of a young girl , a sister perhaps ? A tragic thing , one of those horrible proofs of the law of chance that an almost infinite number of combinations are possible . This girl was cursed with ugliness , that is the only way to describe it . It was no single factor of a bent back , adenoidal jaw or protruding nose . Instead it was the damning combination of traits that combined to form a single , repellent whole . I did n't like it . But what did it matter ... . I sat down suddenly with the clear realization that I was being incredibly stupid . Angelina had given me a simple brief glimpse into the dark motivations that had made her , shaped her life . Of course . The girl in the picture was Angelina herself . With this realization so many other things became clear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that deadly mind should be housed in such an attractive package . The answer was clearly that I was n't looking at the original package that had shaped the mind . To be a man and to be ugly is bad enough . What must it feel like to a woman ? How do you live when mirrors are your enemies and people turn away rather than look at you ? How do you bear life when at the same time you are blessed  --  or cursed ? with a keen and intelligent mind that sees and is aware of everything , makes the inescapable conclusions and misses not the slightest hint of repulsion . Some girls might commit suicide , but not Angelina . I could guess  | what she had done . Hating herself , loathing and detesting her world and the people on it , she would have had no compunction about committing a crime to gain the money she wanted . Money for an operation to correct one of those imperfections . Then more money for more operations . Then someone who dared to stop her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she killed him . The slow upward ( limb through crime and murder  --  to beauty . And during the child ) the wonderful brain that had been housed in the informed flesh had been warped and changed . Poor Angelina . I could be sorry for her without forgetting the ones she h ; ul killed . Poor , tragic , alone girl who in winning half the battle bad lost the other half . Purchased skill had shaped the body into a lovely  --  truthfully an angelic  --  form . Yet in succeeding , the strength of the mind that had accomplished all this had been de-orrmed until it had been made as ugly as the body had been in the beginning . Yet if you could change a body  --  could n't you change a mind ? Could something be done for her ? The very pressure and magnitude of my thoughts drove me out of the small room and into the air . It was nearing midnight and the guards would be stationed below and all the doors locked . Rather than face the explanations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be no one in the roofgardens and walkways this time of night ; I could be alone . Freibur has no moon , but it was a clear night and the stars cast enough light to see by . The roof guard saluted when I went by , and I could see the red spark of a cigarette in his hand . I should have said something about it , but my mind was too occupied . Passing on I turned a corner and stood leaning on the parapet , looking out unseeingly at the black bulk of the mountains . Something kept gnawing for attention and after a few minutes I recognized what it was . The guard . He was there for a purpose , and smoking on duty was n't considered the best behavior for a sentry . Perhaps I was being finicky , but it is a failing of mine . Take care of all the small factors and the big ones take care of themselves . In any case , simply thinking about it was bothering me , so I might as well go around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his usual post , which was optimistic ; at least he was making the rounds and keeping an eye on things . I started to walk  | back when I noticed the broken flowers hanging from the edge of the garden . This was most unusual because the roofgardens were the Count 's special pleasure and were practically manicured daily . Then I saw the dark patch in among the flowers and had the first intimation that something was very , very wrong . It was the guard , and he was either dead or deeply unconscious . I did n't bother to find out which . There was only one reason I could think of for someone to be here at night like this . Angelina . Her room was on the top floor , almost below this spot . Silently 1 ran to the decorative railing and looked over . Five meters below was the white patch of the balcony outside her window . Something black and formless was crouched there . My gun was in my room . For one of the few times in my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten . My concern over Angelina was going to cost her her life . All of this I realized in a fraction of a second as my fingers ran along the balustrade . A shiny blob was fixed there , anchoring a strand so thin that it was invisible , yet I knew was as strong as a cable . The assassin had lowered himself with a web-spinner , a tiny device that spun a thin strand like a spider . Only the strand 's substance was formed of a single long-chain molecule that could support a man 's weight . It would slice my hands like the sharpest blade if I tried to slide down it . There was only one way I could reach that balcony , a tiny square above the two kilometer drop into the valley below . I made the decision even as I was leaping up onto the rail . It had a wide flat top and I sat for an instant to catch my balance . Below me the window swung open noiselessly and I dropped , my heels extended , aiming for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hitting him squarely I caromed off his shoulder and we both sprawled onto the balcony . It shivered under the impact , but the ancient stone held . The fall had halfstunned me , and with pain-blurred reasoning I hoped that his shoulder felt as bad as my leg . For a few moments I could do nothing but gasp for breath and try to scramble towards him . A long , thin-bladed knife had been knocked from his hand by the impact and I could see it glittering where he reached for it . His fingers clutched it just as I attacked . He grunted and made a vicious stab  | at me that brushed my sleeve . Before he could draw back I had his knife wrist in my hand and clamped on . It was a silent , nightmare battle . Both of us were half-dazed from my drop , yet we knew it was life we were battling for . I could n't stand because of my bruised kg and he was instantly on top of me , heavier and stronger . I le could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took all the strength of both my arms to hold away the menacing blade . There was no sound other than our hoarse panting . This assassin was going to win as weight and remorseless strength brought the knife down . Sweat almost blinded me , but I could still see well enough to notice the twisted way his other arm hung . I had broken a bone when I hit  --  yet he had never made a sound . There is no such thing as fair fighting when you are struggling for your life . I squirmel my leg out from under him and managed to bend it enough to dig the knee into his broken arm . His whole body shuddered . I did it again . Harder . He twisted , trying to pull away from the pain . I heaved sideways , throwing him off balance . His elbow bent as he tried to save himself from falling and I put all my strength in both hands turning that sinewy wrist and driving the hand backwards . It almost worked , but he was still stronger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chest . Even as I was fighting to turn the hand again he shuddered and died . A ruse would not have tricked me  --  but this was no ruse . I felt every muscle in his body tighten rock-hard in a spasm as he fell sideways . My grip on his wrist did n't lessen until the light came on in the room behind me . Only then did I see the ugly yellow stain halfway up the blade of the knife . A quick-acting nerve poison , silent and deadly . There , on the sleeve of my shirt , was a thin yellow mark where the blade had brushed me . I knew these poisons did n't need a puncture , they could work just as well on the naked skin . With infinite caution , struggling against the fatigue that wanted my hands to shake , I peeled my shirt slowly off . Only when it had been hurled on top of the corpse did I let myself drop backwards , gasping for air . My leg could work now , though it hurt hideously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported my weight . Turning , I stumbled to the high window and threw it open . Light  | streamed out on the body behind me . Angelina was sitting up in bed , her face smooth and her hands folded on the covers in front of her . Only her eyes showing any awareness of what had happened . " Dead , " I said with a dry throat , and spat to clear it . " Killed by his own poison . " I stumped into the room , testing my leg . " I was sleeping , I did n't hear him open the window , " she said . " Thank you . " Actress , liar , cheat , murderess . She had played a hundred roles in countless voices . Yet when she said those final words there was a ring of unforged feeling to them . This murder attempt had come too soon after the earlier traumatic scene . Her defenses were still down , her real emotions showing . Her hair hung to her shoulders , brushing the single ribbons of her nightgown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimate . This sight , on top of the events of the evening , removed any reserve I might have had . I was kneeling by the bed , holding her shoulders and staring deep into her eyes , trying to reach what lay behind them . The locket with the broken chain lay on the bedside table . I grabbed it in my fist . " Do n't you realize this girl does n't exist except in your own memory , " I said , and Angelina did n't move . " It 's past like everything else . You were a baby  --  now you 're a woman . You were a little girl ? now you 're a woman . You may have been this girl  --  but you are not any more ! " With a convulsive movement I turned and hurled the thing out of the window into the darkness . " You 're none of those things of the past , Angelina ! " I said with an intensity louder than a shout . " You are yourself . . . just your-self ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pushing away or rejection there had been before . As I needed her , she needed me.  | DAWN WAS JUST to u'hing the sky when I brought the assassin 's body in to the Count . I was deprived of the pleasure of waking him since the sergeant of the guard had already done this when the roof sentry had been discovered . The guard was dead too , from a tiny pnneture of the same poison-tipped blade . The guardsmen and the Count were all gathered around the body on the floor of the Counts sitting room and chattering away about this mystery , the inexplicable death of the sentry . They did n't see me until I dropped my corpse down by the other one , and they all jumped back . " Here 's the killer , " I told them , not without a certain amount of pride . Count Cassitor must have recognized the thug because he gave a shuddering start and popped his eyes . No doubt an ex-relative , brother-in-law or something . I imagined he had n't believed that the Radebrechen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A certain uneasiness about the guard sergeant gave me my first cue that I was imagining wrong . The sergeant glanced back and forth from the corpse to the Count and I wondered what thoughts were going through his shaven and thick-skulled military head . There were wheels within wheels here and I would like to have known what was going on . I made a mental note to have a buddyto-buddy talk with large at the first opportunity . The Count chewed his cheek and cracked his knuckles over the bodies , and finally ordered them dragged out . " Stay here , Bent , " he said as I started to leave with the others . I dropped into a chair while he locked the rest out . Then he made a rush for the bar and choked down about a waterglass full of the local spirits . Only when he was working on his second glass did he remember to offer me some of this potable aqua regia . I was n't saying no , and while I sipped at it I wondered what he was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the doors and sealed the  | single window . His ring key unlocked the bottom drawer of his desk and he took out a small electronic device with controls and an extendible aerial on top . " Well look at that ! " I said when he pulled out the aerial . Ile did n't answer me , just shot a long look at me from under his eyebrows , and went back to adjusting the thing . Only when it was turned on and the green light glowed on the top did he relax a bit . " You know what this is ? " he asked , pointing at the gadget . " Of course , " I said . " But not from seeing them on Freibur . They are n't that common . " " They are n't common at all , " he mumbled , staring at the green light which glowed steadily . " As far as I know this is the only one on the planet  --  so I wish you would n't mention it to anybody . Anybody , " he repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him with disarming lack of interest . " I think a man 's entitled to his privacy . " I liked privacy myself and had used snooper-detectors like this one plenty of times . They could sense electronic or radiation snoopers and gave instant warning . There were ways of fooling them , but it was n't easy to do . As long as no one knew about the thing the Count could be sure he was n't being eavesdropped on . But who would want to do that ? He was in the middle of his own building  --  and even he must know that snooper devices could n't be worked from a distance . There was distinct smell of rat in the air , and I was beginning to get an idea of what was going on . The Count did n't leave me any doubt as to who the rat was . " You 're not a stupid man , Grav Diebstall , " he said , which means he thought I was a lot stupider than he was . " You 've been offplanet and seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are here , or you would n't have joined with me to help throw off the yoke around our planet 's neck . No sacrifice is too great if it will bring closer this day of liberation . " For some reason he was sweating now and had resumed his unpleasant habit of cracking the knuckles . The side of his head  --  where Angela had landed the bottle ? was covered with plasti-skin and dry of sweat . I hoped it hurt . " This foreign woman you have been guarding ? " the Count said , turning sideways but still watching me from the corners of his eyes . " She had been of some help in organizing things , but is now putting us in an embarrassing position . There has been one attempt on  | her life and there will probably be others . The Radebrechen are an old and loyal family  --  her presence is a continued insult to them . " Then he pulled at his drink and delivered the punch line . " I think that you can do the job she is doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you like that ? " Without a doubt I was just brimming over with talent  --  or there was a shortage of revolutionaries on this planet . This was the second time within twelve hours that I had been offered a partnership in the new order . One thing I was sure of though  --  Angelovely 's offer had been sincere . Cassi Duke of Rdenrundt 's proposition had a distinctly bad odor to it . I played along to see what he was leading up to . " I am honored , noble Count , " I oozed . " But what will happen to the foreign woman ? I do n't imagine she will think much of the idea . " " What she thinks is not important , " he snarled and touched his fingers lightly to the side of his head . He swallowed and got his temper back under control . " We can not be cruel to her , " he said with one of the most insincere smiles I have ever seen on a human being 's face . " We 'll just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I imagine will be loyal , but my men will take care of them . You will be with her and arrest her at the proper time . Just turn her over to the jailers who will keep her safe . Safe for herself , and out of sight where she can cause no more trouble for us . " " It 's a good plan , " I agreed with winning insincerity . " I do n't enjoy the thought of putting this poor woman in jail , but if it is necessary to the cause it must be done . The ends justify the means . " " You 're right . I only wish I was able to state it so clearly . You have a remarkable ability to turn a phrase , Bent . I 'm going to write that down so I can remember it . The ends justify . . . He scratched away industriously on a note plate . What a knowledge of history he had  --  just the man to plan a revolution ! I searched my memory for a few more old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flooded with a sudden anger . I jumped to my feet . " If we are going to do this we should not waste any time , Count Rdenrundt , " I said . " I suggest i800 hours tonight for the action . That will give you enough time to arrange for the capture of her  | guards . I will be in her rooms and will arrest her as soon as I have a message from you that the first move has succeeded . " " You 're correct . A man of action as always , Bent . It will be as you say . " We shook hands then and it took all the will power I possessed to stop from crushing to a pulp his limp , moist , serpentine paw . I went straight to Angelina . " Can we be overheard here ? " I asked her . " No , the room is completely shielded . " " Your former boy-friend , Count Cassi , has a snooper-detector . He may have other equipment for listening to what goes on here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She sat by the mirror , brushing her hair . The scene was lovely but distracting . There were strong winds blowing through the revolution that threatened to knock everything down . " I know about the detector , " she said calmly , brushing . " I arranged for him to get it  --  without his knowledge of course  --  and made sure it was useless on the best frequencies . I keep a close watch on his affairs that way . " " Were you listening in a few minutes ago when he was making arrangements with me to kill your guards and throw you into the dungeons downstairs ? " " No , I was n't listening , " she said with that amazing self-possession and calm that marked all her actions . She smiled in the mirror at me . " I was busy just remembering last night . " Women ! They insist on mixing everything up together . Perhaps they operate better that way , but it is very hard on those of us who find that keeping emotion and logic separate produces sounder thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this situation . " Well , if that little bit of news does n't interest you , " I said as calmly as I could , " perhaps this does . The rough Radebrechens did n't send that killer last night  --  the Count did . " Success at last . Angelina actually stopped combing her hair and her eyes widened a bit at the import of what I said . She did n't ask any stupid questions , but waited for me to finish . " I think you have underestimated the desperation of that rat upstairs . When you dropped him with that bottle yesterday , you pushed him just as far as he could be pushed . He must have had his plans already made and you made his mind up for him . The ser-  | geant of the guard recognized the assassin and connected him with the Count . That also explains how the killer got access to the roof and knew just where to find you . it 's also the best explanation I can imagine for the suddenness of this attack . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your battle with Cassitor the Cantankerous . " Angelina had gone back to combing her hair while I talked , fluffing up the curls . She made no response . Her apparent lack of interest was beginning to try my nerves . " Well  --  whit are you going to do about it ? " I asked , with more than a little note of peevishness in my voice . " l ) o n't you think it 's more important to ask what you are going to do about it ? " She delivered this line very lightly , but there was a lot behind it . I saw she was watching me in the mirror , so I turned and went over to the window , looking out over the fatal balcony at the snow-summitted mountain peaks beyond . What was I going to do about it ? Of course that was the question here  --  much bigger than she realized . What was I going to do about the whole thing ? Everyone was offering me half-interests in a revolution I had n't the slightest interest in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had I come to arrest Angelina for the Special Corps ? That assignment seemed to have been forgotten a while back . A decision had to be reached soon . My body disguise was good  --  but not that good . It was n't intended to stand up to long inspection . Only the fact that Angelina was undoubtedly sure that she had killed me had prevented her from recognizing my real identity so far . I had certainly recognized her easily enough , facial changes and all . Just at this point the bottom dropped out of everything . There is a little process called selective forgetting whereby we suppress and distort memories we find distasteful . My disguise had n't been meant to stand inspection this long . Originally I had been sure she would have penetrated it by now . With this realization came the memory of what I had said the night before . A wickedly revealing statement that I had pushed back and forgotten until now . You 're none of these things out of the past , I had shouted . None of these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there had been no protest from her .  | Except that she no longer used the name Angelina , she used the alias Engela here . When I turned to face her my guilty thoughts must have been scrawled all over my face , but she only gave me that enigmatic smile and said nothing . At least she had stopped combing her hair . " You know I 'm not Grav Bent Diebstall , " I said with an effort . " How long have you known ? " " For quite a while ; since soon after you came here , in fact . " " Do you know who I am ? ? " " I have no idea what your real name is , if that 's what you mean . But I do remember how angry I was when you tricked me out of the battleships , after all my work . And I recall the intense satisfaction with which I shot you in Freiburbad . Can you tell me your name now ? " " Jim , " I said through the haze I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim to the trade . " " How nice . My name is really Angela . I think it was done as a horrid joke by my father , which is one of the reasons I enjoyed seeing him die . " " Why have n't you killed me ? " I asked , having a fairly good idea of how father had passed on . " Why should I , darling ? " she asked , and her light , empty tone was gone . " We 've both made mistakes in the past and it has taken us a dreadfully long time to find out that we are just alike . I might as well ask you why you have n't arrested me  --  that 's what you started out to do is n't it ? " " It was  --  but ... " " But , what ? You must have come here with that idea in mind , but you were fighting an awful battle with yourself . That 's why I hid the fact that I knew who you really were . You were growing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police in the first place . I had no idea how the whole thing would come out , though I did hope . You see I did n't want to kill you , not unless I had to . I knew you loved me , that was obvious from the beginning . It was different from the feeble animal passion of all those male brutes who have told me that they love me . They loved a malleable case of flesh . You love me for everything that I am , because we are both the same . " " We are not the same , " I insisted , but there was no conviction in  | my voice . She only smiled . " You kill  --  and enjoy killing  --  that 's our basic difference . Do n't you see that ? " " Nonsense ! " She dismissed the idea with an airy wave . " You killed last night  --  rather a good job too  --  and I did n't notice any reluctance on your part . In fact , was n't there a certain amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit I felt as if a noose was tightening around my neck . Everything she said was wrong  --  but I could n't see where it was wrung . Where was the way out , the solution that would solve everything ? " Let 's have Freibur , " I said at last . " Get away from this monstrous and unnecessary rebellion . There will be deaths and killing 1111 ( 1 no need for them . " " We 'll go  --  if we go someplace where we can do just as well , " Angela said , and there was a hardness back in her voice . " That 's not the major point though . There 's something you are going to have to settle in your own mind before you will be happy . This stupid importance you attach to death . Do n't you realize how completely trivial it is ? Two hundred years from now you , I and every person now living in the galaxy will be dead . What does it matter if a few of them are helped along and reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same to you if they had the chance . " " You 're wrong , " I insisted , knowing that there is more to living and dying than just this pessimistic philosophy , but unable in this moment of stress to clarify and speak my ideas . Angela was a powerful drug and my tiny remaining shard of compassionate reserve did n't stand a chance , washed under by the flood of stronger emotions . I pulled her to me , kissing her , knowing that this solved most of the problems although it made the final solution that much more difficult . A thin and irritating buzz scratched at my ears , and Angela heard it too . Separating was difficult for both of us . I sat and watched unseeingly while she went to the vidiphone . She blanked the video circuits and snapped a query into it . I could n't hear the answer because she had the speaker off and listened through the earpiece . Once or twice she said yes , and looked up suddenly at me . There was no indication of whom she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . There were problems enough around . After hanging up she just stood quietly for a moment and I  | waited for her to speak . Instead she walked to her dressing table and opened the drawer . There were a lot of things that could have been concealed there , but she took out the one thing 1 wus least suspecting . A gun . Big barreled and deadly , pointing at me . " Why did you do it , Jim ? " she asked , tears in the corners of her eyes . " Why did you want to do it ? " She did n't even hear my baffled answer . Her thoughts were on herself  --  though the recoilless never wavered from a point aimed midway in my skull . With alarming suddenness she straightened up and angrily brushed at her eyes . " You did n't do anything , " she said with the old hard chill on her words . " I did it myself because I let myself believe that one man could be any different from the others . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will kill you quickly , instead of in the way I would much prefer . " " What the hell are you talking about , " I roared , completely baffled . " Do n't play the innocent to the very end , " she said , as she reached carefully behind her and drew a small heavy bag from under the bed . " That was the radar post . I installed the equipment myself and have the operators bribed to give me first notice . A ring of ships  --  as you well know  --  has dropped from space and surrounded this area . Your job was to keep me occupied so I would n't notice this . The plan came perilously close to succeeding . " She put a coat over her arm and backed across the room . " If I told you I was innocent  --  gave you my most sincere word of honor  --  would you believe me ? " I asked . " I have nothing to do with this and know nothing about it . " " Hooray for the Boy Space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do n't you admit the truth , since you will be dead in twenty seconds no matter what you say . " " I 've told you the truth . " I wondered if I could reach her before she fired , but knew it was impossible . " Good-by , James diGriz . It was nice knowing you  --  for a while . Let me leave you with a last pleasant thought . All this was in vain . There is a door and an exit behind me that no one knows about . Before your police get here I shall be safely gone . And if the  | thought tortures you a bit , I intend to go on killing and killing and killing and you will never be able to stop me . " My Angela raised the gun for a surer aim as she touched a switch in the molding . A panel rolled back revealing a square of blackness in the wall . " Spare me the histrionics , Jim , " she said disgustedly , her eyes looking into - nine over the sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't expect that kind of juvenile trick from you , staring over my shoulder and widening your eyes as if there were someone behind - ne . I 'm not going to turn and look . You 're not getting out of this one alive . " " Famous last words , " I said as I jumped sideways . The gun boomed but the bullet plowed into the ceiling . Inskipp stood behind her , twisting the gun into the air , pulling it out of her hand . Angela just stared at me in horror and made no move to resist . There were handcuffs locked on her tiny wrists and she still did n't struggle or cry out . I jumped forward , shouting her name . There were two burly types in Patrol uniforms behind Inskipp , and they took her . Before I could reach the door he stepped through and closed it behind him . I stumbled to a halt before it , as unable to fight as Angela had been a minute ago . 19 " HAVE A DRINK , " Inskipp said , dropping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ersatz terran brandy , not this local brand of plastic solvent . " He offered me a cupful . " Drop dead , you . . . " I followed with some of the choicer selections from my interstellar vocabulary , and tried to knock the cup out of his hand . He fooled me by raising it and drinking it himself , not in the least annoyed . " Is that any kind of language to use on your superior officer in the Special Corps ? " he asked and refilled the cup . " It 's a good thing we 're a relaxed organization without too many rules . Still ?  | there are limits . " He held out the cup again and this time I grabbed it and drained it . " Why did you do it ? " I asked , still wracked by conflicting emotions . " Because you did n't , that 's why . The operation is over , you are a success . Before you were merely on probation , but now you are a full agent . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star mnade of paper . After licking it carefully and solemnly he reached out and stuck it to the front of my shirt . " I hereby appoint you a Full Agent of the Special Corps , " he intoned , " by authority of the power vested in me . " Cursing , I reached to pick the damn thing off  --  and laughed instead . It was absurd . It was also a fine commentary on the honors that went with the job . " I thought I was no longer a member of the crew , " I told him . " I never received your resignation , " Inskipp said . " Not that it would have meant anything . You ca n't resign from the Corps . " " Yeah  --  but I got your message when you gave me a discharge . Or did you forget that I stole a ship and you set off the scuttling charge by remote to blow me up ? As you see I managed to pull the fuse just before it let go . " " Nothing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to sip his second drink . " You were so insistent about looking for the fair Angelina that I thought you might want to borrow a ship before we had a chance to assign you one . The one you took had the fuse rigged as it always is on these occasions . The fuse  --  not the charge ? is set to explode five seconds after it is removed . I find this gives a certain independence of mind to prospective agents who regret their manner of departure . " " You mean  --  the whole thing was a frame-up ? " I gurgled . " You might say that . I prefer the term graduating-exercise ' . This is the time when we find out if our crooked novices really will devote the rest of their lives to the pursuit of law and order . When they find out , too . We do n't want there to be any regrets in later years . You found out , did n't you Jim ? " " I found out something . . . I 'm not quite sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk about the one thing closest to me . " It was a fine operation . I must say you showed a lot of imagina-  | lion in the way you carried it out . " Then he frowned . " But that business with the bank , I ca n't say I approve of it . The Corps has all the funds you will need . . . " " Same money , " I snapped . " Where does the Corps get it ? From planetary governments . And where do they get it from ? Taxes of course . So I take it directly from the bank . The insurance company pays the bank for the loss , then declares a smaller income that year , pays less taxes to the government  --  and the result is exactly the same as your way ! " Inskipp was well acquainted with this brand of logic so did n't even bother to answer . I still did n't want to talk about Angela . " How did you find me ? " I asked . " There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature that you are , " Inskipp said , raising his hands in feigned horror . " Do you really think that any of our ships are n't bugged ? And the job done so well it can not be detected if you do n't know where to look . For your information the apparently solid outer door of the spacelock contains quite a complex transmitter , strong enough for us to detect at quite a distance . " " Then why did n't I hear it ? " " For the simple reason that it was n't broadcasting . I should add that the door also contains a receiver . The device only transmits when it receives the proper signal . We gave you time to reach your destination and then followed you . We lost you for a while in Freiburbad , but picked up your trail again in the hospital , right after you played musical chairs with the corpses . We lent you a hand there , the hospital was justifiably annoyed but we managed to keep them quiet . After that it was just a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your next move was obvious . I hope you 'll be pleased to know that you are carrying a very compact little transmitter in your sternum . " I looked at my chest but of course saw nothing . " It was too good an opportunity to miss , " Inskipp went on . There was no stopping the man . " One night when you were under sedation the good doctor found the alcohol we had seen fit to include in one of your supply packages . He of course took advantage of this shipping error and a Corps surgeon made a little operation of his own . " " When you have been following me and watching ever since ? "  | ' That 's right . But this was your case , just as much as it would have been if you knew we were there . " ' Then why did you move in for the kill like this ? " I snapped . " I did n't blow the whistle for the marines . " This was the big question of the hour and the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about answering . " It 's like this , " he drawled , and took a sip of his drink . " I like a new man to have enough rope . But not so much that he will hang himself . You were here for what might be called a goodly long time , and I was n't receiving any reports about revolutions or arrests you had made . " What could I say ? His voice was quieter , more sympathetic . " Would you have arrested her if we had n't moved in ? " That was the question . " I do n't know , " was all I could say . " Well I damn well knew what I was going to do , " he said with the old venom . " So I did it . The plot is well nipped before it could bud and our multiple murderess is offplanet by now . " " Let her go ! " I shouted as I grabbed him by the front of the jacket and swung him free of the ground and shook him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would you turn her loose again  --  the way she is ? " was all he answered . Would I ? I suppose I would n't . I dropped him while I was thinking about it and he straightened out the wrinkles in the front of his suit . " This has been a rough assignment for you , " he said as he started to put the flask away . " At times there can be a very thin line between right and wrong . If you are emotionally involved the line is almost impossible to see . " " What will happen to her ? " I asked . He hesitated before he answered . " The truth  --  for a change , " I told him . " All right , the truth . No promises  --  but the psych boys might be able to do something with her . If they can find the cause of the basic aberration . But that can be impossible to find at times . " " Not in this case  --  I can tell them . " He looked surprised at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that case there might be a chance . I 'll give positive orders  | that everything is to be tried before they even consider anything like personality removal . If that is done she is just another body , of which there are plenty in the galaxy . Sentenced to death she 's just another corpse  --  of which there is an equal multitude . " I grabbed the flask away from him before it reached his pocket , and opened it . " I know you Inskipp , " I said as I poured . " You 're a born recruiting sergeant . When you lick them  --  make them join . " " What else , " he said . " She 'd make a great agent . " " We 'd make a great team , " I told him and we raised our cups . " Here 's to crime . "  | I STOOD IN LINE , as patient as the other taxpayers , my filled out forms and my cash gripped hotly in my hand . Cash , money , the old fashioned green folding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive to the local customers . I was scratching under the artificial beard , which itched abominably , when the man before me stepped out of the way and I was at the window . My finger stuck in the glue and I had a job freeing it without pulling the beard off as well . " Come , come , pass it over , " the aging , hatchet-faced , bitter and shrewish female official said , hand extended impatiently . " On the contrary , " I said , letting the papers and banknotes fall away to disclose the immense .75 recoilless pistol that I held . " You pass it over . All of that tax money you have extracted from the sheeplike suckers who populate this backward planet . " I smiled to show that I meant it and she choked off a scream and began scrabbling in the cash drawer . It was a broad smile that showed all of my teeth , which I had stained bright red , which should have helped her decide on the proper course of action . As the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topcoat that was completely lined with deep pockets . " What are you doing ? " the man behind me gasped , eyes bulging like great white grapes . " Taking money , " I said and flipped a bundle at him . " Why do n't you have some yourself . " He caught it by reflex , goggled at it , and all the alarms went off at once and I heard the doors crashing shut . The cashier had managed to trigger an alarm . " Good for you , " I said , " but do n't let a minor thing like that prevent you from keeping the cash coming . " She gasped and started to slip from sight , but a wave of the gun  | and another flash of my carmine dentures restored a semblance of life , and the flow of bills continued . People started to rush about and gun waving guards began to appear looking around enthusiastically for someone to shoot , so I triggered the radio relay in my pocket . There was a series of charming explosions all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gas bomb , followed by the even more charming screams of the customers . I stopped stowing money long enough to slip on the gas-tight goggles and settle them into place . And to clamp my mouth shut so I was forced to breathe through the filter plugs in my nostrils . It was fascinating to watch . Blackout gas is invisible and has no odor but it does contain a chemical that acts almost instantly , bringing about a temporary but complete paralysis of the optic nerve . Within fifteen seconds everyone in the bank was blind . With the exception of James Bolivar diGriz , myself , man of many talents . Humming a happy tune through closed lips I stowed away the remaining money . My benefactress had finally slid from sight and was screaming incontinently somewhere behind the counter . So were a lot of other people . There was plenty of groping about and falling over things as I made my way through this little blacked out corner of bedlam . An eerie sensation indeed , the one-eyed man in the country of the blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pressing in fascinated awe against the windows and glass doors , to watch the drama unfolding inside . I waved and smiled and a shudder passed through the nearest as they pushed back in panic from the door . I shot the lock out , angling the gun so the bullets shrieked away over their heads , and kicked the door open . Before exiting myself I threw a screamer out onto the sidewalk and quickly pushed the stopples into my ears . The screamer sounded off and everyone began to leave quickly . You have to leave quickly when you hear one of these things . They send out a mixed brew of devilish sounds at the decibel level of a major earthquake . Some are audible , sounds like a magnified fingernail on a blackboard , while others are supersonic and produce sensations of panic and imminent death . Harmless and highly effective . The street was otherwise empty when I walked out to the car that was just pulling up to the curb . My head was throbbing with the supersonics that got past the plugs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open door and relax while Angelina gunned the machine down the street . " Everything go all right ? " she asked , keeping her eyes on the road as she whipped around a corner on the outside wheels . Sirens began to sound in the distance . " A piece of cake . Smooth as castor oil ... " " Your similes leave a lot to be desired . " " Sorry . A touch of indigestion this morning . But my coat is lined with more money than we could possibly need . " " How nice ! " she laughed , and she meant it . That irresistible grin , the crinkled nose . I longed to nibble it , or at least kiss her , but settled for a comradely pat on the shoulder since she needed all her concentration for driving . I popped a stick of gum in my mouth that would remove the red tooth dye and began to peel off my disguise . As I changed so did the car . Angelina turned into a side street , slowed and then found an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in sight . She pressed the button . My , but technology can do some interesting things . The license plate flipped over to reveal a different number , but that was too simple a trick to even discuss . Angelina flicked on the windshield wipers as a fine spray of catalytic fluid sprang out of jets on the front of the car . Wherever it touched the blue paint turned a bright red . Except for the top of the car which became transparent so that in a few moments we were sitting in a bubble-top surveying the world around . A good deal of what appeared to be chrome plated metal dissolved and washed away altering the appearance and even the make of the car . As soon as this process was complete Angelina sedately turned a corner and started back in the direction from whence we had come . Her orange wig was locked away with my disguise and I held the wheel while she put on an immense pair of goggly sunglasses . " Where to next ? " she asked as a huddle of shrieking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was thinking of the shore . Wind , sun , sand , that sort of thing . Healthy and bracing . " " A little too bracing if you do n't mind my saying so . " She patted the rounded bulge ' of her midriff with a more than satisfied smile . " It 's six months now , going on seven , so I 'm not feeling that ath-  | letic . Which reminds me ... " She flashed me a quick scowl , then turned her attention back to the road . " You promised to make an honest woman out of me so that we could call this a honeymoon . " " My love , " I said , and clasped her hand in all sincerity . " At the first possible moment . I do n't want to make an honest woman out of you  --  that would be physically impossible since you are basically as larcenous minded as am  --  but I will certainly marry you and slip an expensive ? " " Stolen ! " " ? ring on this delicate little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to register a marriage we 'll be fed into the computer and the game will be up . Our little holiday at an end . " " And you 'll be hooked for life . I think I better grab you now before I get too round to run and catch you . We 'll go to your beach resort and enjoy one last day of mad freedom . And tomorrow , right after breakfast , we are getting married . Do you promise ? " " There is just one question . . . " " Promise , Slippery Jim , I know you ! " " You have my word except . . . " She braked the car to a skidding stop and I found myself looking down the barrel of my own .75 recoilless . It looked very big . Her knuckle was white on the trigger . " Promise you quick-witted slippery tricky crooked lying con man or I 'll blow your brains out . " " My darling , you do love me ! " " Of course I do . But if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you dead . Speak ! " " We get married in the morning . " " Some men are so hard to convince , " she whispered , slipping the gun into my pocket and herself into my arms . Then she kissed me with such delicious intensity that I almost looked forward to the morrow .  | " WHERE ARE YOU GOING , SLIPPERY JIM ? " Angelina asked , leaning out of the window of our room above . I stopped with my hand on the gate . " Just down for a quick swim , my love , " I shouted back and swung the gate open . A .75 roared and the ruins of the gate were blown out of my hand . " Open your robe , " she said , not unkindly , and blew the smoke from the gun barrel at the same time . I shrugged with resignation and opened the beach robe . My feet were bare . But of course I was fully dressed , with my pants legs rolled up and my shoes stuffed into my jacket pockets . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're going nowhere . " " Of course I 'm not . " Hot indignation . " I 'm not that sort of chap . I was just afraid you might misunderstand . I just wanted to nip into the shops and ... " " Upstairs . " I went . Hell bath no fury etc. was invented to describe my Angelina . The Special Corps medics had stripped her of her homicidal tendencies , unknotted the tangled skeins of her subconscious and equipped her for a more happy existence than circumstance had previously provided . But when it came to the crunch she was still the old Angelina . I sighed and mounted the stairs with leaden feet . And I felt even more of an unthinking fiend when I saw that she was crying . " Jim , you do n't love me ! " A classic gambit since the first woman in the garden , but still unanswerable . " I do , " I protested , and I meant it . " But , it 's just . . . reflex . Or something like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like going to prison . And in all my crooked years I have never been sent up . " " It is liberation , not captivity , " she said and did things with her makeup that removed the ravages of the tears . I noticed for the first  | time that she had white lipstick on to match her white dress and a little white lacy kind of thing in her hair . " This is just like going swimming in cold water , " she said , standing and patting my cheek . " Get it over with quickly so you wo n't feel it . Now roll down your pants and put those shoes on . " I did , but when I straightened up to answer this last fatuous argument I saw that the door had opened and that a Marriage Master and his two witnesses were standing in the next room . She took my arm , gently , 1'II say that for her , and at the same time the recorded strains of the mighty organ filled the air . She tugged at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward as a gray mist seemed to fall over my eyes . When the darkness lifted the organ was bleating its dying notes , the door was closing behind the departing backs and Angelina stopped admiring her ring-decorated finger long enough to raise her lips to mine . I had barely enough strength of will left to kiss her first before I groaned . There were a number of bottles on the sideboard and my twitching fingers stumbled through them to unerringly find a knobby flask of Syrian Panther Sweat , a potent beverage with such hideous aftereffects that its sale is forbidden on most civilized worlds . A large tumbler of this was most efficacious , I could feel it doing me harm , and I poured a second one . While I was doing this and immersed in my numbed thoughts a period of time must have passed because Angelina  --  my Angelina ( suppressed groan ) ? now stood before me dressed in slacks and sweater with our bags packed and waiting at her side . The glass was plucked from my fingers . " Enough private whoopee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll celebrate tonight but right now we have to move . The marriage record will be filed at any moment and when our names hit the computer it 's going to light up like a knocking shop on payday . By now the police will have tied us in to most of the crimes of the past two months and will come slavering and baying after us . " " Silence , " I ordered , swaying to my feet . " The image is a familiar one . Get the car and we will leave . " I offered to help with the bags but by the time I communicated this information she was halfway down the stairs with them . With this encouragement I navigated the hazard and reached the door . The car was outside humming with unleashed power , the side door  | open and Angelina at the wheel tapping her foot with equally unleashed impatience . As I stumbled into it the first tentacles of reality penetrated my numbed cortex . This car , like all other ground cars on Kamata , was steam powered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peat bricks fed to the furnace by an ingenious and unnecessarily complicated device . It took at least a half an hour to raise steam to get moving . Angelina must have fired up before the wedding and planned every other step as well . My solitary contribution to all this was a private drunk which had been very little aid at all . I shuddered at what this meant , yet was still driven to the only possible conclusion . " Do you have a drive-right pill ? " I asked , hoarsely . It was in the palm of her hand even as I spoke . Small , round , pink , with a black skull and crossbones on it . A sobering invention of some mad chemist that worked like a metabolic vacuum cleaner . Short minutes after hitting the hydrochloric acid pool of my stomach the ingredients would be doing a blitzkrieg attack through my bloodstream . Not only does it remove all of the alcohol but strips away all of the side products associated with drinking as well , so that the pitiful subject is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't take it without water , " I mumbled , blinking at the plastic cup in her other hand . There was no turning back . With a last happy shudder I flipped the deadly thing into the back of my throat and drained the cup . They say it does n't take long , but that is an objective time . Subjective was hours . It is a most unusual experience and difficult to describe . Imagine if you will what it feels like to take the nozzle of a cold water hose in your mouth and then to have the water turned on . And then , an instant later , to have the water gushing in great streams from every orifice of your body , including the pores , until you are flushed completely clean . " Wow , " I said weakly , sifting up and dabbing at my forehead with my handkerchief . The houses of a small village rushed by and were replaced by farmlands . Angelina drove with calm efficiency and the boiler chunked merrily as it ate another brick of peat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dived into a traffic circle and left it by a different road with only a quick glimpse at the map . " The  | alarm is out for us , army , navy , everything . I 've been listening to their command radio . " " Are we going to get away ? " " I doubt it  --  not unless you come up with some bright idea very quickly . They have a solid ring with aerial cover around the area and are tightening it . " I was still recovering from the heroic treatment of the driveright pill and had not collected all my wits . There was a direct connection from my muddled thoughts to my vocal cords that had no intervening censor of intelligence . " A great start to marriage . If this is what it is like no wonder I have been avoiding it all these years . " The car swung off the road and shuddered to a stop in the deep grass under a row of blue-leaved trees . Angelina was out , had slammed the door and was reaching for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell her . " I 'm a fool ... " " Then I 'm a fool too for marrying you . " She was dry eyed and cold of voice with all of her emotions strictly under control . " I tricked you and trapped you into marriage because it was what I thought you really wanted . I was wrong , so it is going to end right now before it really gets started . I 'm sorry , Jim . You made an entirely new life for me and thought I could make one for you . It has been fun knowing you . Thank you and good-by . " By the time she had finished , my thoughts had congealed into something roughly resembling their normal shape and I was weak but ready . I was out of the car before she had finished talking and standing in front of her , blocking her way , holding her most gently by the arms . " Angelina , I will tell you this but once and probably never again the rest of my life . So listen well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crook in the galaxy , before I was conned into the Special Corps to help catch other crooks . And I caught you . Not only were you a crook but a mastermind criminal as well and a cheerfully sadistic murderess . " I felt her body shiver in my hands and held her tighter . " It has to be said , because that is what you were . You are n't any more . You had reasons to be that way and the reasons have been removed and some unhappy quirks in your otherwise pristine cortex have been straightened out . And now I love you . But  | I want to remember that I loved you even then during your unreconstructed days , which is saying a lot . So if I buck at the harness now , or am difficult to deal with in the mornings , just remember that and make allowances . Is it a deal ? " It apparently was . She dropped the bag  --  on my toe , but I dared not flinch  --  and wrapped her arms around me and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I had a jolly time kissing her right back . The newlywed effect I suppose you would call it , great fun .. . We froze , rigid , as a pair of flywheel cycles moaned and skidded to a stop by our car . Only the police used these since they move a good deal faster than the peat-powered steamers . They are tricycle affairs with a great heavy flywheel encased between the rear wheels . They plugged them in at night so their motor-generators could run the flywheel up to top speed . During the day the flywheel generated electricity to drive the motors in each wheel . Very efficient and smog-free . Very dangerous . " This is the car , Podderl " one of the police shouted out over the constant moan of the flywheels . " I 'll call it in . They ca n't have gone far . We sure have them trapped now ! " Nothing infuriates me like the bland assurances of petty officials . Oh yes , really trapped now . I growled deep in my throat as the other uniformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our cozy cuddle in the grass . He was still gaping when I lunged an arm up and around his neck with a tight squeeze on his throat and pulled him down to join us . It was fun to watch his tongue come out and his eyes pop and his head turn red but Angelina spoiled it . She whipped off his helmet and rapped him smartly ? and accurately  --  on the temple with the heel of her shoe . He turned off and I let him drop . " And you talk about me , " my bride whispered . " You 've got more than a touch of the old sadist in your own makeup . " " I called it in . Everybody knows . We 've sure got them now ... " the enthusiastic remaining officer said , but his voice rattled to a stop when he looked down the muzzle of his associate 's riot gun . Angelina dug a sleep capsule out of her bag and snapped it under his nose .  | " And now what , boss ? " she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the side of the road . " I have been thinking , " I said , and rubbed my jaw and frowned with deep concentration to prove it . " We have had over four months of worryless holiday , but all good things must end . We could extend our leave . But it would be hectic to say the least and people would get hurt and you  --  while that is a fine shape  --  it is not quite the shale for flight and pursuit and general nastiness . Shall we return to the service from which we fled ? " " I was hoping you would say that . Morning sickness and bank robbery just do n't seem to mix . It will be fun to get back . " " I'altieolarly since they will be so glad to see us . Considering that they turned down our request for leave and we had to steal that mail ship . " " Not to mention all the expense money we have stolen because we could n't touch our bank accounts . " " Right . Follow me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stripped off their uniforms and gently laid the snoring peace officers in the rear of the car . One had pink polkadot underwear while the other 's was utilitarian black  --  but trimmed with lace . Which might have been local custom of dress but gave me second thoughts about the police on Kamata and I was glad we were leaving . Uniformed , helmeted , and goggled we hummed merrily down the road on our flywheel cycles waving to all the tanks and trucks that roared by the other way . Before there were too many screams and shouts of discovery I braked in the center of the road and signaled an armored car to a stop . Angelina swung her cycle behind them so that they would not find the sight of a pregnant police officer too distracting . " Got them cornered ! " I shouted . " But they have a radio so keep this off the net . Follow me . " " Lead on ! " the driver shouted , his mate nodding agreement while thoughts of rewards , fame , medals danced dazzlingly before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the woods that ended at a small lake complete with ramshackle boathouse and dock . I braked , waved them to a stop , touched my fingers to my lips and tiptoed back to their car . The driver lowered the side window and looked out expectantly .  | " Breathe this , " I said and flipped a gas grenade through the opening . There was a cloud of smoke followed by gasps followed by two more silent uniformed figures snoring in the grass . " Going to take a quick peek at their underwear ? " Angelina asked . " No . I want to maintain some illusions , even if they are false " The cycles rolled merrily down the dock and off into the water where they steamed and shorteircuited and made a lot of bubbles . As soon as the armored car had aired out we boarded and drove away . Angelina found the driver 's untouched lunch and cheerfully consumed it . I avoided most of the main roads and headed back to the city where the command post was located at the central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action was . We parked in the underground garage , deserted now , and took the elevator to the tower . The building was almost empty , except for the command center , and I found an unoccupied office nearby and left Angelina there . Innocently amusing herself with the sealed ? but easily opened  --  confidential files . I lowered my goggles into place and staged a dusty , exhausted entrance to control . I was ignored . The man I wanted to see was pacing the floor sucking on a long dead pipe . I rushed up and saluted . " Sir , are you Mr. Inskipp ? " " Yar , " he muttered , his attention still on the great wall chart that theoretically showed the condition of the chase . " Someone to see you , sir . " " What ? What ? " he said , still distracted . Harold Peters Inskipp , director and mastermind of the Special Corps , not quite with it this day . He followed me out easily enough and I closed the door and slipped off the heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I told him . " If you can find a quiet way of getting us off this planet without the locals getting their greedy hands on us . " His jaw clenched with anger and fractured the mouthpiece of the pipe into innumerable fragments . I led him , spitting out pieces of plastic , to the room where Angelina was waiting .  | " Anncnl " TNSKII'I ' SN VuYn , and shook the sheaf of papers in his hand so that they rattled like dry skeletal bones . " Very expressive , " I said , slipping a cigar from my pocket humidor and holding it to my ear . " But with a very minimal content of information . Could you be more explicit ? " I pinched the cigar 's small end and there was not the slightest crackle . Perfection . " Do you know how many millions your crime wave has cost ? The economy of Kamata . . . " " Will not suffer an iota . The government will reimburse the institutions that suffered the losses and will then in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Special Corps . Which has more money that it can possibly use in any case . And look at the benefits bestowed in return . Plenty of excitement for the populace , increased sales of newspapers , exercise for the sedentary law enforcement officers  --  and that is an interesting story in itself  --  as well as field maneuvers that were a pleasure for everyone involved . Far from being annoyed they should pay us a fee for making all these exciting things possible . " I lit the cigar and blew out a great cloud of fragrant smoke . " Do n't play wise with me , you aging con man . If I turned you and your bride over to the Kamata authorities you would still be in jail 600 years from now . " " Little chance of that , Inskipp , aging con man yourself . You are short of good field agents as it is . You need us more than we need you . So consider this chewing out at an end and get on with the business . I have been chastised . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and threw it across the desk to him . " Here , rip off my medals and reduce me to the ranks . I am guilty . Next case . " With a final simulated growl of anger he filed the papers in the wastebasket and took out a large red folder that buzzed threateningly when he touched it . His thumb print defused the security device and the folder dropped open .  | " I have a top secret gravely important assignment here . " ' What other kind do I ever get ? " " It is hideously dangerous as well . " " You are secretly envious of my good looks and have a death wish for me . Come on , Inskipp . Stop sparring and let me know what the deal is . Angelina and I can handle it better than the rest of your senile and feeble agents . " " This job of work is for you alone . Angelina is , well . . . " His face reddened and he examined the file closely . " Whoopee ! " I shouted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , secret power in the galaxy today . And he ca n't say the word pregnant ! How about baby ? Wait , sex , that is a goodie . You blush to think about it . Go ahead , say sex three times fast , it will do you good ? " " Shut up , diGriz , " he growled . " At least you finally married her which shows you have a single drop of honesty in your otherwise rotten carcass . She stays behind . You go out on this one-man job . Probably leaving her a widow . " " She looks awful in black so you ca n't get rid of me that easily . Tell . " " Look at this , " he said , taking a roll of film from the folder and slipping it into a slot in his desk . A screen dropped down from the ceiling and the room darkened . The film began . The camera had been handheld , the color was off at times , and it was most unprofessional . But it was the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so good . Authentic , no doubt about it . Someone was waging war . It was a sunny day with white puffs of clouds against a blue sky . And black puffs of antiaircraft fire in among them . But the fire was not heavy and there was not enough of it to stop the troop carriers that came in low and fast for landing . This was at an average sized spaceport , with the buildings in the far background and some cargo ships nearby . Other craft roared in low and bomb explosions reached skyward from what must have been the defense positions . The impossibility of what was happening finally came home to me . " Those are spaceships ! " I gurgled . " And space transports . Is some numbskull government so stupid as to think that it can sueN ..  | teed in an interplanetary war ? What happened after they lost  --  and how does it affect me ? " The film ended and the lights came up again . Inskipp steepled his fingers on the desk and leered over them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and so did the other ones before it . This film was taken by a smuggler , one of our regular informants , whose ship was just fast enough to get away during the battle . " This was a stopper . I dragged deeply on the cigar and considered what little I knew about interplanetary warfare . There was little enough to know . Because it just does n't work . Maybe a few times in the galaxy when local conditions are right , say a solar system with two inhabited planets . If one planet is backward and the other advanced industrially the primitive one might be invaded successfully . But not if they put up any kind of a real defense . The distance-time relationships just do n't make this kind of warfare practical . When every soldier and weapon and ration has to be lifted from the gravity well of a planet and carried across space the energy expenditure is considerable , the transport demands incredible and the cost unbelievable . If , in addition , the invader has to land in the face of determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solar system where the planets are practically touching on a galactic scale . The thought of warfare between planets of differing star systems is even more impossible . But , once again , it has been proven that nothing is basically impossible if people want to tackle it hard enough . And things like violence , warfare and bloodshed are still hideously attractive to the lurking violence potential of mankind , despite the centuries of peace and stagnation . I had a sudden and depressing thought . " Are you telling me that a successful interplanetary invasion has been accomplished ? " I asked . " More than one . " That evil smirk was decorating his face as he spoke . " And you and the League would like to see this practice stopped ? " " Right on the head , Jim my boy . " " And I am the sucker who has been picked for the assignment ? " He reached out , took my cigar from my numb fingers and  | dropped it into the ashtray  --  then solemnly shook my hand . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I slipped my hand from his treacherous embrace , wiped my fingers on my pantsleg and grabbed back my cigar . " I 'm sure that you will see that I have the best funeral the Corps can afford . Now , would you care to squeeze out a few details or would you prefer to blindfold me and shoot me out in a one-way cargo rocket ? " " Temper , my boy , temper . The situation seems to be quite clear . There has been little word about this in the news media because of a certain political confusion surrounding the invasions , plus a rigid censorship by the planets under consideration . As we have reconstructed it  --  and good men have died getting this information  --  the responsible world is named Cliaand , the third planet in the Epsilon Indi system . There are two score planets orbiting this sun , but only three are inhabitable . And inhabited . Cliaaiid took over both the sister worlds some years ago , but we considered this no cause for alarm . What is alarming is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heretofore considered an impossibility . They have invaded and conquered five other planets in nearby systems and seem poised for bigger and better things . We do n't know how they are doing it , but they must be doing something right . We have had agents on the conquered worlds but have learned little of value . The decision has been made , a high level one I assure you ? you would stand and salute if you heard some of the names of the people involved  --  that we must get a man to Cliaand to root out the problem at the core of the woodpile and cut the Gordian knot . " " Other than being contained in a mixed and disgusting metaphor I think the idea is a suicidal one . Instead of this we could ... " " You are going . There is no possible way to wriggle out of this one , Slippery Jim . " I tried . But nothing worked . I was given a copy of all the known details , a cortex-recording of the language and the masterkey to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned gloomily to our quarters where Angelina , tired of doing her hair and her nails , was throwing a knife at a head-sized target on the far wall . She was very good . Even underhand , after a quick draw from her arm sheath , she could hit the black spot of either eye . " Let me get a pic of Inskipp , " I said . " It will make a more in-  | teresting target and one that you can get a degree of pleasure out of . " " Is that evil old man sending my darling out on a job ? " " That dirty old goat is trying to get me killed . The assignment is so top secret I ca n't tell a soul about it , particularly you , so here are all the papers , read them for yourself . " While she did this I slipped the Cliaand language recording into the stamping nru  --  hine . ' Phis recorded the material directly on my cortex without the boring and time-consuming intermediary of any learning process . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen or more shorter reinforcing sessions after that . I would end np speaking the language and having one hell of a headache iron ' all the electronic fingering of my synapses . But there was a period of total unconsciousness while the machine operated and that was just what I felt like at the moment . I slipped the helmet down over my ears , settled on the couch and pressed the button . There was a flicker of no-time and Angelina was carefully lifting off the helmet and handing me a pill at the same instant . I swallowed it and kept my eyes closed while the pain ebbed away . Soft lips kissed mine . " They are trying to kill you , but you will not let them . You will laugh and win and someday you will have Inskipp 's job . " I opened one eye a crack and looked at her jubilant expression . " Come home with my shield or on it ? Go to glory or the grave ? Are you worried about me ? " " All of the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not stand in the way of your career ? " " I did n't know I had one until you told me just now . " " ? and will do everything I can to help . " " You ca n't come with me , for a very obvious and protruding reason . " " I know that . But I will be with you in spirit all the time . How are you going to land on this world ? " " Board my nimble pursuit ship , come in straight and fast behind a radar screen , zing down into the atmosphere ? " " And get blasted into your component atoms . Here , read this report by the survivor of the last ship to try this approach . " I read it . It was most depressing . I threw it back with the others . " I heed the warning . This planet appears to be militarized to the  | hilt . I 'll bet even the house pets wear uniforms . Bulling in like that is approaching these people on their own terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What they are not organized against is a little bit of guile , some larceny , a smooth approach covering a devious attack . Insinuate , penetrate , operate and extirpate . " " All at once I am beginning not to like it , " my love said , frowning . " You will take care of yourself , Jim ? I do n't think worrying would be good for me right now . " " If you wish to worry , worry about the fate of this poor planet with Slippery Jim unleashed against them . Their conquests are at an end , they are as good as finished . " I kissed her resoundingly and walked out , head high and shoulders back . Wishing that I was one tenth as sure of myself as I had acted . This was going to be a very rough one . MY PLANNING HAD BEEN DETAILED , the preparations complex , the operation gigantic . I had received more than one shrill cry of pain from Inskipp about the cost , all of which I dutifully ignored . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was hedging all the bets that I could to assure my corporeal survival . But even the most complicated plan is eventually completed , the last details sewed up , the final orders issued . And the sheep led to the slaughter . Baaa . Here I was , naked to the world , sitting in the bar of the intersystem spacer Kannettava , a glass of strong drink before me and a dead cigar clutched in my fingers . Listening to the announcement that we would be landing on Cliaand within the hour . I was naked , figuratively speaking of course . It had taken an effort of will and strong discipline to force myself to leave every article of an illegal nature behind . I had never done this before in my entire life . No minibombs , gas capsules , gigli saws , fingertip drills , card holdouts ,  | phone tappers . Nothing . Not even the lockpick that was always fixed to my toe nail . Or .. . I grated my teeth at the thought and looked about me . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner and none was looking at me . Slipping my wallet from my pocket I touched the scam at the top . And felt a certain stiffness . Memory , how it cuts both ways , revealing and clouding . My own subconscious was fighting against me . Only my conscious mind was at all enthusiastic about landing on Cliaand without any illegal devices . I squeezed the wallet hard in the right way and the tiny but incredibly strong lockpick dropped into my fingers . A work of art . I admired it when I raised my glass . And said good-by . On the way hack to my cabin I dropped it into a waste disposal . It would go on with the ship while I landed on this singularly inhospitable world . Every report and interview indicated that Cliaand had the most parauoic customs men in the known universe . Contraband simply could not be smuggled in . Therefore I was not trying . I was just what I appeared to be . A salesman , representative of FazzolettoMouchoir Ltd. , dealers in deadly weapons . The firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation could prove otherwise . Let them try . They did . Landing on Cliaand was not unlike going into prison . I , and the handful of other debarkees , trundled down the gangway and into a gray room of ominous aspect . We huddled together , under the eyes of watchful and heavily armed guards , while our luggage was brought and dumped nearby . Nothing happened until the gangway had been withdrawn and the Kannettava had departed . Then , one by one , we were called out . I was not first and I welcomed the opportunity to examine the local types . They were supremely indifferent to us , stamping about in knee-high boots , fingering their weapons and keeping their chins up high . Their uniforms were all the same color , a color which at first glance might be mistaken for a very unmilitary hue of carmine , a purplish red . Very quickly I realized that this was almost exactly the color of blood , half arterial blue , half venous pink . It was rather disgusting and hard to avoid looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the nature of the wearer . All of the guards were on the large side and ran to protruding jaws and little piggy eyes . Their helmets looked like fibersteel , with  | sinister black visors and transparent faceplates that could be dropped down . Each carried a gaussrifle , a multipurpose and particularly deadly weapon . High capacity batteries stored a really impressive electrical charge in the stock . When the trigger was depressed a strong magnetic field was generated in the barrel which accelerated the missile with a muzzle velocity that equaled any explosive cartridge weapon . And the gaussrifle was superior in that it had a more rapid rate of fire , made no sound , and shot out any one of an assortment of deadly missiles , from poison needles to explosive charges . The Corps had reports about this weapon but we had never seen one . I made plans to rectify that situation as soon as possible . " Pas Ratunkowy , " someone shouted and I stirred to life as I remembered this was my cover name . I waved hesitantly and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do believe that he had metal plates on his heels to increase the militaristic effect . I looked forward to getting a pair of these boots as well : I was beginning to like Cliaand . " You Pas Ratunkowy ? " " I am he , sir , at your service , " I answered in his native tongue , being careful to keep a foreign accent . " Get your luggage . Come with me . " He spun about and I had the temerity to call after him . " But , sir , bags are too heavy to carry all at once . " This time he impaled me with a cold , withering look and fingered his gaussrifle suggestively . " Cart , " he finally snarled and stabbed a finger at the far side of the prison yard . I humbly went after cart . This was a drably efficient motorized platform that rolled along on small wheels . I quickly loaded my bags onto it and looked for my guide . He stood by a now open door with his finger even closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at top speed and I galloped after the thing towards the door . The inspection began . How easy that is to say . But it is one of those simple statements like " I dropped the atom bomb and it went off . " This was the most detailed and thorough inspection I had ever experienced and I was exceedingly happy that I had found that lockpick first . There were ten men waiting in the smooth-walled , antiseptically white room . Six took my baggage while the other four took me . The  | first thing they did was strip me mother naked and drop me onto a fluoroscope . A magnifying one . Seconds later they were conferring over a blown-up print of the fillings in my teeth . There was a mutual decision that one of them was unduly large and had a rather unusual shape . A sinister looking array of dental gadgetry emerged and they had the filling out in an instant . While the tooth was being refilled with euauuel  --  l 'll say that much for them  --  the original filling was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elated when its metallic content proved to be that of an aecel ) ted dental alloy . The search went on . While my tender pink person was being probed one of the inquisitors tpruduced a file of papers . Most of these were psigrams sent out after my landing application had been received . They had consulted Fazzoletto-Mouchoir Ltd. , my employers , and had all the details of my job . It is a good thing that this was legitimate . I responded correctly to all the questions , inserting random sounds only twice when the physical examination probed a tender spot . This appeared to go well ; at least the file was closed and put aside . While this was going on I had been catching glimpses of the fate of my bags . They suffered more than I did . Each of them had been opened and emptied , the contents spread out on the white tables , and the bag was then methodically taken to pieces . To little pieces . The seams were cut open , the fastening removed , the handles dissected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saved . No doubt for a later and most detailed inspection . My clothing was given only a perfunctory examination then pushed aside . I soon found out why . I would not be seeing it again until I left the planet . " You will be issued with good Cliaand clothing , " one of my inquisitors announced . " It is pleasure to wear . " I doubted that very much but kept my silence . " Is this religious symbol , " another asked , holding the photograph in his fingertips at arm 's length . " It is a picture of my wife . " " Only religious symbols permitted . " " She is like an angel to me . " They puzzled over this one for awhile , then reluctantly admitted the picture . Not that I would be able to have anything as deadly as the original . It was whisked away and a photographic copy re-  | turned . Angelina seemed to be scowling in this print or perhaps that was only my imagination . " All of your personal items , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you leave , " I was coldly informed . " While on Cliaand you will wear local dress and observe local customs . Your personal items are there . " Three very utilitarian and ugly pieces of luggage were indicated . " Here is your identification card . " I grabbed at it , happy to be assured of my existence , still naked and beginning to get a chill . " What is in this locked case ? " an inspector called out , a ring of expectancy in his voice like that of a hound catching the scent . They all stopped work and came over as the incriminating case was held out for my inspection . Their expressions indicated that whatever answer I gave would be admission of crime to be followed by the death penalty . I permitted myself to cringe back and roll my eyes . " Sirs , I have done nothing wrong . . . " 1 cried . " What is it ? " " Military weapons ? " There were stifled cries and one of them looked around as though for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . " But , sirs , you must understand . These are the reason I came to your hospitable planet . My firm , Fazzoletto-Mouchoir Ltd. , is an old and much respected manufacturer in the field of military electronics . These are samples . Some most delicate . Only to be opened in the presence of an armament specialist . " " I am armament specialist , " one of them said , stepping forward . I had noted him earlier because of his bald head and a sinister scar that drew up one eye in a perpetual wink . " Pleased to meet you , sir . I am Pas Ratunkowy . " He was unimpressed by my name and did not offer his . " If I can have my key ring I will open said case and display to you its contents . " A camera was swung into place to record the entire operation , before I was permitted to proceed . I unlocked the case and flipped back the lid . The armament specialist glared down at the various components in their padded niches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sole manufacturer of the memory line of proximity fuses . No other line is as compact as ours , none as versatile . " I used tweezers to take a fuse from a holder . It was no  | larger than a pinhead . " This is the most miniscule , designed to be used in a weapon as small as a handgun . Firing activates the fuse which will then detonate the charge in the slug when it comes near a target of predetermined size . This other fuse is the most intelligent , designed for use in heavy weapons or missiles . " They all leaned forward eagerly when I held up the wafer of the Mem-IV and pointed out its singular merits . " All solid state construction , capable of resisting incredible pressures , thousands of ( : ' s , massive shocks . It can be preset to detonate only when approaching a specific target , or can be programmed externally and electronically at any time up to the moment of firing . It contains cliscrinlination circuits that will prevent explosion in the vicinity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced it carefully and closed the lid on the case . A happy sigh swept through the spectators . This was the kind of thing they really liked . The armament specialist took up the case . " This will be returned to you when it is needed to demonstrate . " Reluctantly , the examination drew to a close . The fuses had been the highpoint of the search and nothing else could quite equal this . They had some fun squeezing the tubes and emptying the jars in my toilet kit but their hearts were not really in it . Finally tiring of this they bundled away all my goods and tossed me my new clothing . " Four and half minutes to dress , " an exiting inspector said . " Bring bags . " My garments were not what might be considered high fashion under any conditions . Underwear and such were a drab utilitarian gray and manufactured from some substance that felt like a mixture of shredded machine shop waste and sandpaper . I sighed and dressed . The outer garment was a one piece jumpsuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of wasp with its wide black and yellow bands . Well , if that is what the well dressed Cliaandian wore , that is what I would wear . Not that I had much choice . I picked up the two bags , their sharp handles instantly cutting into my palms , and left through the single open door . " Car , " a guard said outside , pointing to a driverless bubbletopped vehicle that stood nearby . We were now in a large room , still decorated in the same prison gray . The side door of the vehicle opened at my approach .  | " I will be pleased to take car , " I nodded and smiled . " But where shall I go ? " " Car knows . In . " Not the galaxy 's most witty conversationalists . I threw in my bags and sat down . The door wheezed shut and the bank of lights on the robodriver lit up . We started forward and a heavy portal swung open before us . And another and another , each one thick enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shot up into the open air and I winced at the impact of sunlight . And looked on with great interest at the passing scene . Cliaand , if this nameless city was any example , was a modernized , mechanized , and busy world . Cars and heavy lorries filled the motorways , all apparently under robot control since they were evenly spaced and moved at impressive speeds . Pedways were on both sides and crossed overhead . There were stores , signs , crowds , uniforms . Uniforms ! That single word does not convey the bemedaled and multicolored glories that surrounded inc . Everyone wore a uniform of some sort with the different colors , I am sure , denoting the different branches and services . None of them were striped yellow and black . One more handicap placed in my way , but I shrugged it off . When you are drowning who cares if a teacup of water is poured over your head . Nothing about this piece of work was going to be easy . My car darted out of the rushing traffic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop before an ornately decorated doorway . The great golden letters Zlato-Zlato were inscribed over the entrance which , in Cliaandian , might be translated as luxury . This was a pleasant change . A beribboned , jeweled and elegant doorman rushed forward to open the door , then stopped and curled his lip when he saw my clothes . He let go of the door and stamped away and his place was taken by a bullet-necked individual in a dark gray uniform . Little silver crossed knife-and-battle-ax insignia were on both shoulders and his buttons were silver skulls . Somehow , not very encouraging . " I am Pacov , " this depressing figure mumbled . " Your bodyguard . " " A pleasure to meet you , sir , a real pleasure . " I climbed out , carrying my own bags it will be noted , and followed the grim back of my watchdog into the lobby of the hotel ,  | which is what it proved to be . My identification was accepted with a maximum of discourtesy , a room assigned , a bellboy reluctantly prodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My status as a theoretically respected uffworld sales representative got me into the establishment , but that slid not mean that I had to like it . My wasp colors branded Inc an alien , and alien they were going to keep me . The quarters were luxurious , the bed soft , the bugs enthusiastically present . Sound and optic , they seemed to be built into every fitting and fixture . Every other knob on the knobbed furniture was a microphone and the light bulbs turned to follow me with their heady little eyes when I moved . When I went into the bath to shave an optical eye looked back at me through the lightly silvered mirror and there was another optical pickup in the end of my toothbrush  --  no doubt to spy out any secrets lurking in my molars . All very efficient . They thought . It made to laugh , and I did , turning it into a snort when it emerged so my patient bodyguard would not be suspicious . He pad-padded after me wherever I went in the spacious apartment . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I retired . And all of this was of no avail . Love laughs at locksmiths  --  and so does Jim diGriz . Who knows an incredible amount , if you will excuse my seeming immodesty , about bugging . This was a case of massive overkill . So there were a lot of bugs . So what do you do with all that information ? Computer circuitry would be completely useless in an observational situation like this one , which meant that a large staff of human beings would be watching , recording and analyzing . There is a limit to the number of people who can be assigned to this kind of work because a geometric progression soon takes place with watchers watching watchers until no one is doing anything else . I am sure there was a large staff keeping a keen eye on me , foreigners were rare enough to enjoy this luxury . Not only would my quarters be bugged but the areas I normally passed through , ground cars and such . The entire city could not be bugged , nor was there reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act my normal humble cover-role self for awhile until I found the opportunity to leave the bugged areas . And cook up a plan that would permit my complete disappearance once I was out of sight . I would have only one chance at this ; what-  | ever plan I produced would have to work the first time out or I would be a very dead rat . Pacov was always there , watching my every motion . He was watching when I went to sleep at night and the suspicious look in those hard little eyes was the first thing I saw in the morning . Which was just the way I wanted it . Pacov would be the first to go , but until then his mere presence with me meant that my watchers were relaxed . Let them relax . I looked relaxed , too  --  but I was n't . I was examining every aspect of the city that I could see , looking for that rathole . On the third day I found it . It was one of the many possibilities I had under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best . I made plans accordingly and that night smiled into the darkness as I went to sleep . I 'm sure the smile was observed with infrared cameras  --  but what can be read from a smile ? The fourth day opened as did all the others with breakfast served in the room . " My , my , but I am hungry today , " I told the glowering Pacov . " It must be the exhilarating atmosphere and aura of good cheer on your fine planet . I believe I will have a little more to eat . " I did . A second breakfast . Since I had no idea when my next meal might be I decided to stoke up as best I could . Standard routine followed . We emerged from the hotel at the appointed hour and the robocar was waiting . It started at once towards its programmed destination , the war office where I had been demonstrating the effectiveness of the Fazzoletto-Mouchoir fuses . A number of targets had been destroyed , and today others would be blasted under even more exacting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the main road , spun down it and turned off into the side road that led to our destination . Traffic was light here  --  as always  --  and no pedestrians were in sight . Perfect . Street after street zipped by and I felt a familiar knot of tension developing . All or nothing , Slippery Jim , here we go .. . " Ah-choo , " I said , with what I hoped was appropriate realism , and reached for my handkerchief . Pacov was suspicious . Pacov was always suspicious . " Bit of dust in nose , you know how it is , " I said . " Say , look , is  | that not the good General Trogbar over there ? " I pointed with my free hand . Pacov was well trained . His eyes only flickered aside for an instant before they rchimed to me . The instant was all I needed . Knotted into the handkerchief was a roll of small coins , the only weapon I could obtain under the authority 's watchful gaze . I had assembled it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the eyes flickered my hand struck , swinging the hard roll in a short arc that ended on the side of Pacov 's head . He slumped with a muffled And even as he slumped down I was leaning over into the front of the car and banging down on the emergency stop button . The motor died , the brakes locked , we squealed to a stop and the doors popped open . Not more than a dozen paces from the selected spot . A bullseye . I was out and running at the same moment . Because when I hit my bodyguard and the stop button every alarm must have lit up on the bugging board  --  there were plenty of little seeing eyes in the car . The forces of the enemy were launched at the same instant I was . All I had were seconds  --  a minute perhaps  --  of freedom before the troops closed in and grabbed me . Would it be enough time ? Running , head down as fast as I could , I turned and skidded into the narrow opening of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of buildings and emerged on a different street . There were robots here loading rubbish into bins , but they ignored me as I ran by since they were simple M types programmed for nothing but this kind of work . The robot pusher was another matter . He was human and had an electronic lash that he used to stir the robots along . It cracked out and snapped around me and the electric current crackled into my side .  | IT WAS SHOCKING , to say the least , but I barely felt it . The voltage is kept low since it is meant to stir the robots , not to cook out their brain circuits . I grabbed the whip as soon as it hit and pulled hard . All of this was of course according to plan . I had seen this robot pusher and his work gang in this same place every day when we passed ; Cliaand does love its routine . The robot pusher , a thicknecked and thuggy looking individual , could be counted on to interfere with a running alien  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled on the whip I had him off balance and he staggered towards me , jaw agape , and I let hint have a roundhouse right on the point of that agaping jaw . It connected . He shook his head , growled something , and came at me with his hands ready to crunch and rend . This was not according to plan . He was supposed to drop instantly so I could rush through the rest of the routine before the cavalry arrived . How could I have known that not only did he have the IQ of a block of stone but the constitution of one as well ? I stepped aside , his fingers grabbed empty air , and I began to sweat . Time was passing and I had no time . I had to render this hulk unconscious in the quickest way possible . I did . It was n't graceful but it worked . I tripped him as he went by , then jumped on his back and rode him to the ground accelerating his fall . And held him by the head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocks  --  I was afraid the pavement would give way before he did  --  before he grunted and relaxed . In the distance the first siren sounded . I sweated harder . Indifferent to the ways of man the robots dumped their dustbins . The robot pusher was dressed in a uniform of a decomposed green in color , no doubt symbolic of his trade . It was closed with a single zipper which I unzipped , then began to work the clothing off his bulky and unyielding form . While the sirens grew closer . At the last moment I had to stop and tear his boots off in order to remove  | the trousers , a noisome operation that added nothing good to the entire affair . The siren echoed loudly from the walls of the service street and brakes squealed nastily close by . With what very well might be called frantic haste I pulled the uniform on over my own wasp-like garb and zipped it shut . Running feet pounded loudly towards me . I grabbed up the whip and let the nearest robot have a crack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a bin ! " I ordered and stood back as it grabbed up its former master . The feet had just vanished from view when the first of the red uniformed soldiers burst into sight . " Ann alien ! " I shouted , and shook my whip towards the other end of the narrow street . " He went thataway . Fast . Before I could stop him . " The soldiers kept going fast as well . Which was a good thing since the pair of recently removed boots were lying there right in plain sight . I threw them in the bin after their owner and cracked the whip on my half dozen robots . " We march , " I ordered . " To the next location . " I hoped they were programmed for a regular route  --  and they were . The truckrobot led the way and the others fell in behind them . I went behind , whip ready . My little procession emerged into the police gorged , soldier full street . Armored vehicles twisted around us and drivers cursed . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this mess while I , with a paralyzed smile on my lips , trotted along after them . I was afraid that if I made any attempt to change the orders my mechanical team would stage a sitdown right there in the street . We passed behind the abandoned groundcar just as my old bodyguard , Pacov , was being helped from it . I turned my back on him and tried to ignore the chill prickling up and down the nape of my neck . If he recognized me .. . The first robot entered another serviceway and I staggered after them until , after what felt like a two day walk , I entered this haven of relative safety . It was a coolish day but I was sweating heavily : I leaned against the wall to recover while my robots emptied the bins . More cars were still appearing in the street I had so recently left and a flight of jets thundered by overhead . My , but they certainly were missing me.  | What next ? A good question . Very soon now , when no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rernember the one witness to his escape . And they would want to talk to the robot pusher again . Before that moment came I would have to be elsewhere  --  but where ? My assets were very limited ; a collection of garbage collecting robots , now industriously clanking away at their trade , two uniforms  --  one worn over the other  --  either of which made me a marked man , and an electronic whip . Good only for whipping robots ; the feeble current it generated was just enough to close a relay to cancel a previous order or action . What to do ? There was a grating noise close behind me and I jumped aside as a rusty iron door slid upwards . A fat man in a white hat poked his head out . " I got another barrel in here for you , Slobodan , " he said , then looked suspiciously at me . " You ai n't Slobodan . " " You 're right . Slobodan is someone else . And he is somewhere else . In the hospital . Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . " Was opportunity tapping ? I talked fast and thought even faster . There was still plenty of rushing about in the street I had so recently crossed but no one was looking into the serviceway . I cracked my whip across the gearbox of the nearest robot and ordered him to me . " Follow that man , " I said , snapping my whip in the right direction . White hat popped back inside , the robot followed him and I followed the robot . Into a kitchen . A big one , a restaurant kitchen obviously . And there was no one else in sight . " What time do you open ? " I asked . " I 'm getting quite an appetite on this job . " " Not until tonight  --  hey ! Tell this robot to stop following me and get that garbage out of here . " The cook was backing around the room with the robot trundling faithfully after him . They made a fine pair . " Robot , " I said , and cracked the whip . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out your implacable little robot hands and grab him by the arms so he can not get away . " The robot 's reflexes , being electronic , were faster than the cook 's . The steel hands closed , the cook opened his mouth to complain ?  | and I stuffed his hat into it . He chewed it angrily and made muffled noises deep in his throat . He kept this up all the time I was tying him into a chair with a fine assortment of towels , securing the gag in place as well . No one else had appeared and my luck was still running strong . " Out , " I ordered the robot , cracking it across the patient metal back . The others were still working away and I laid about like a happy flagellant until they were all quivering for orders . " Return . To the place from whence you came this morning . Go now . " Like well trained troops they turned and started away . Thankfully , in the direction away from the street we had just crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . Safe for the moment . They would trace me to the robot rubbishmen sooner or later , but would have no idea where or when I had left the convoy . Things were working out just fine . The captive cook had managed to knock the chair over and was wriggling , chair and all , towards the exit . " Naughty , " I said , and took the largest cleaver from the rack . He stopped at once and rolled his eyes at me . I put the cleaver and the whip where they could be reached quickly and looked about . For a little while at least I could breathe easy and make some more definite plans . It has all been rush and improvise so far . There was a sudden knocking in the distance and the sharp ringing of a bell . I sighed and picked up the cleaver again . Rush and improvise was the motto of this operation . " What is that ? " I asked the cook , slipping the hat from his mouth for the moment . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his eyes on the cleaver I held ready over his head . I restored the gag and sidled to the swinging door on the far wall and opened it enough to peek through . The dining room beyond was dark and empty . The banging and ringing came from the entrance on the far side . No one else had appeared to answer this noisy summons so I felt safe in assuming that the cook and I were alone for the moment . Now to see what it was all about . With the cleaver at the ready I went to the front entrance , slid back the bolt and opened the door a crack .  | " Whaddayawant ? " I asked , aiming for the same rudimentary grammar and low accent voiced by the cook . " Refrigerator service . You called you got trouble . What kind of trouble ? " " Big trouble ! " My heart bounded with unexpected joy . " Come in and bring biggest toolbox you got . " It was a fair sized toolbox and I let him in , closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the head with the flat of the cleaver blade . He folded nicely . His uniform was a utilitarian dark green , a great improvement on wasp , white or garbage , my only choice up to this moment . I stripped him quickly and tied him to a chair next to the cook where they commiserated in silence with each other . For the first time I was ahead of my pursuers . With luck it would be some hours before my captives were discovered and connected with my flight . I put the green uniform on , prepared a large number of sandwiches , picked up the toolbox , tipped my uniform cap to the captives in the kitchen , and slipped out the front door . A large riding robot was standing there , another toolbox hanging from one hand , humming quietly to itself . Painted on its metallic chest was the same crest of the service company that now adorned my own chest . " We travel in comfort , " I said . " Take this . " I got my fingers out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toolbox . During my rapid trips through the city I had seen a number of these riding robots from a distance , but had never been close to one before . There was a sort of saddle arrangement on their backs where the operator rode , but I had n't the slightest idea of how to get into the seat . Did the thing kneel to be mounted or drop down a ladder or what ? Cars and other robots were going by in this street and a squad of soldiers was approaching at a good clip . I found myself sweating again . " I wish to leave . Now . " Nothing happened . Except that the soldiers were that much closer . The robot stood as stolid as a statue . There was no help here . I did n't know if it was the orthodox manner or not , I had to do something , so I put one foot on the thing 's hip socket , grabbed a riding light up near its shoulder blade and swarmed up its side . Hidden motors hummed louder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight . I slipped into the saddle just as the squad of soldiers trotted by . They ignored me completely . The seat was comfortable . I had a good view , with my head at least three meters above the ground , and I had n't the slightest idea what to do next . Though leaving this vicinity would make fine openers . A compact control panel was set into the top of the robot 's head and 1 pressed the button labeled WALK . I felt the grinding vibration of internal gears being engaged and it began to mark time in place . A good beginning . A rapid search found the button marked FORWARD . It lurched ahead and broke into an easy trot . 1 soon left the police and all the excitement behind . A plan was needed . I rode my mechanical mount through the heat of the city and considered my position . One man against a world . Very poetic and possibly disconcerting except for the fact that I had been in this position before while they had not . All of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Cliaand and always kept under close surveillance . Perhaps they had never lost track of one before and this was sure to be a great annoyance . Heads would roll . Fine . As long as one of them was n't mine . In a sense I had the advantage . Other than my cover identity they knew nothing about me . If I could lose myself in the depths of their depressing culture I would be impossible to find . As long as I stayed submerged . Positive action would come later . Right now I had to save my valuable hide and plan for the future . One of the city exits was ahead and an unusually large number of uniformed individuals were involved in examining and searching everyone attempting to leave . A touch on the LEFT button started my mount down another street away from this danger . When I wanted to leave the city I would . That time had not yet arrived . By mid afternoon I had a working knowledge of the layout of the city and was developing calluses on my bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a recharge from some handy wall socket . I needed a recharge from the sandwiches in the toolbox . We both needed a rest . And the chances were good that my prisoners had been found in the kitchen and that the new alarm was going out . Using the more vacant side streets I worked the robot back to the manufacturing district that I had noted earlier and looked for a place to hole up . I had seen some factories and warehouses with a distinctly deserted air that would fit my needs .  | One did . Cobwebs on the windows and rust on the hinges of the front door . No one in sight and a lock that I could have opened in the dark with my fingernails . The door creaked open , not a soul was in sight . We slipped in and the bolt clicked behind us . Security . The place was deserted , dusty and for the most part empty . A great ancient piece of machinery brooded in one corner , as featureless and mysterious as a lost jungle idol , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I lunched , relaxed , searched the building , found an interior room with no windows , brought in the flashlight and a pencil from the toolbox and one of the sacrificial cartons . Time for the next step . Pencil in hand , the blank square before me illuminated by the light , I spoke aloud . " Now hear this . Memory is about to begin . The count will start at ten . I will become tired during the progression and by the time zero is reached I will be asleep . The memory is keyed to the word ... xanadul " " Ten , " I said , feeling fine . Then " Nine " and I yawned . By the time I hit five my eyelids were drooping and I have no memory at all of ever getting to zero . I AWOKE TO FIND MY FINGERS STIFF , my arm cramped , my eyes sore . And the great square of cardboard covered with a complex wiring diagram . The subconscious is a fine place to hide things unknown to the conscious mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I now knew just how to use it . The plan was a dazzlingly simple one and I was instantly jealous of whoever dreamed it up . It also required a bit of time , a lot of electronic wiring and equipment . All of which would have to be stolen . I sighed and stretched my cramped muscles . It had been a tiring day and my sleep during the hypnotic trance had been no sleep at all . Tomor-  | row would be another day , the pace of pursuit should have died down . Tomorrow and tomorrow were nothing but work . I was a stainless steel rat gone to ground and there was much scuttling about to be done . The city continued in its business around me , and I 'm sure the search for me went on unabated although it never came near my cozy retreat . I soldered and wired , stole food and other items of comfort and luxury in an almost offhand way . Cliaand seemed to have a very low level of crime because almost no precautions appeared to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Either the criminal class had all been killed off or they now ran the government . Which could very likely be the case . My solitary period would end soon and I would abandon my passive role and indulge in the espionage that I had been sent here to do . Leaving the city was far simpler than I had imagined . By adroit loitering in the area of the checkpoint I saw that the military were in charge of the operation which appeared to proceed in a very simpleminded and military way . A certain amount of saluting and ordering , examining of papers and rubber stamping , a quick search and away . I hoped it would work that easily for me . To make the entire operation military I stole an army truck at dusk , stopping it by planting my robot in the road in front of it . The truck vibrated to a stop and the driver put his head out and cursed fluently . Most of the words had not been in my language lessons and I filed them for future use . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And the same to you , " I told him . " That is no way to talk to civilians . This is emergency . " " What emergency ? " Suspiciously . " This emergency . " Enthusiastically . The needle slammed home in the side of his neck and he slumped . I had also made a raid on a chemical supply house . I pushed him aside , put on his uniform cap , ordered the robot into the back of the truck and returned to the warehouse for my wares . They stowed neatly behind the crates of dehydrated meals , forms in triplicate , cans of boot polish and other essential military items in the truck . Dressed in the soldier 's red uniform , he dozing nicely in my green , I said good-by to the robot , my only friend on this inhospitable planet . He answered nothing in return which did not hurt me . I left .  | My papers and identification were accepted with military taciturnity , examined and approved , and I was free . I sped merrily out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Physically this involved a lot of rushing about , stealing various vehicles to confuse my trail , and a long trek through the central desert to a certain landmark . This was a great lump of stone standing very much by itself in the sea of sand . It was shaped very much like a pot and was called lonac in the Cliaand language . Which means pot and gives you some idea of the great scope of their imagination . The camouflage net covered the stolen groundcar , and I worked most industriously here for seven full days before I was satisfied with the results . What I had built , with my own two little hands and the help of an excavation robot , was a completely selfcontained underground shelter no more than loo meters from Pot rock . This was the last and final bit of preparation for phase three . That night I initiated this phase . My little home-wired transmitter was tuned and ready to go , the antenna pointed straight up at the zenith . Exactly at midnight I turned it on and the narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept it going for exactly thirty seconds , then shut it off . That was that . The die cast and the next move was up to Them . Them being a Special Corps detachment that had arranged this phase . Hopefully arranged it , I would know nothing positive until the following evening . If the plan worked , and I chewed my lip a little over the if as I stowed the radio back into the car , my signal should have been received by them  --  and only by them . Narrow band width and very directional . Impossible to detect . The Cliaandians should know nothing about it at all . But great powers would have been set into motion . Mighty computers computed and gigantic rockets fired . A selected meteorite set into motion along with a collection of accompanying space debris . Out in space beyond the Cliaand detectors . But coming this way , aimed at the solitary rock of the Pot . I had a day and a night to wait . Knowing my attitude towards unproductive waiting I had arranged a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good as I could get in preserved rations , and better drink since I had a far wider assortment to select from . Wine with the meal and more potent distillates afterward . For closers I lit a cigar and turned on the pocket-sized screen of the miniprojector and ran a couple of the feelthy-feely-films that I had bought at an army exchange . Pretty  | crude stuff for the troops , though it looked pretty attractive to me in my desert nomad role . Sleep lowered its gentle blanket , day followed night and then night again in its turn . And as soon as it was dark I was out there with my field glasses quartering the sky . Nothing . It was n't due for hours yet , but I was impatient . The entire plan was beginning to sound absurd . And I was feeling very much alone , trapped on this alien planet light years from civilization . The mood was a depressing one . I had a drink from my pocket flask . If all were going well the great hunk of rock should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was detected by the defenses it should be considered as just another piece of spatial debris . It would hit the atmosphere and burn . If they were tracking it , on the offchance that it might be more than it appeared , this should reassure them . The speed and temperature ruled out any living cargo . It should also be a little difficult to follow because of the accompanying debris that would also be bouncing back radar signals . The meteor would burn through the atmosphere and hit the desert with an impact enough to destroy anything living . If there were an investigation it would be dilatory , and important things would happen before the investigators arrived . I hoped . It all sounded so good in theory and seemed such an absurd piece of madness in practice . Very close to midnight a new star flickered and burned in the clear sky above and I sighed and put away the flask . Right on time like a commuter rocket . The point grew brighter and brighter , then brighter still . Aimed right at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that good . Was the thing going to come down right on top of me ? Not quite . As I watched it appeared to drift to one side , accelerating as it went , while a great hissing roar like a heavenly steam kettle crackled ' through the air . I jumped into the groundcar and kicked it to life as the burning bomb of light vanished behind the tower of the Pot to be followed instantly by a rolling explosion that lit the night air and outlined the Pot with fire . I moved . My headlights picked out a raw pit in the ground , surrounded by debris and overhung with a cloud of smoke and dust . And at the bottom was the great glazed chunk of steaming rock . Bullseye ! I backed the car behind the nearest sand dune and thumbed the transmitter . There was another explosion , infinitely smaller than the  | one of impact , and pieces of rock zinged above my head . When I next looked at the meteor it had been neatly cracked in half by the charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soaking into the sand . At the same moment I heard the rising rumble of approaching jets and killed the headlights . They roared by overhead , triangles of darkness against the stars , and tilted into a turn . At this moment I gained new appreciation of the Cliaand powers of suspicion as well as a deep respect for their radar , computers and organization . I was going to have less time than I thought . I jumped into the hole trying to ignore the heat of the crackling rock . The equipment was intact , scaled into flat boxes , and there was just enough light from the stars for me to drag them out and stow them into the car . The jets circled above , brought to the general area by radar triangulation and searching now for the precise point of impact . Not that they could see much , at their speed in the darkness . But slower aircraft were undoubtedly on the way . With instrumentation and lights that could quarter the area . I moved a little faster at the thought , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon . Panting heavily , the last box in the groundcar , I waited until the jets were swinging away from me before starting for my hidey-hole . I went as fast as I dared , steering around the bigger obstacles and bumping over the small . When the jets swung in my direction I stopped , trying to think tiny , waiting for them to pass . On the next rush I made it to the entrance . As I dropped the first of the boxes into the hole in the ground I did hear engines . Strong lights were flickering in the distance  --  coming my way . Things were being shaved entirely too close . I hurled the boxes out one after another , not caring where or how they landed . I was ready to dive after them and stow them carefully , when great wings fluttered overhead and a sizzling light raced from behind the Pot and flashed over me , blinding me . It moved on and I groped for the car 's starting switch through a galaxy of rainbows and roaring discs of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I kicked it into gear . As the light hit again I fell over the side and lay still . For a considerable length of time I was motionless and bathed by the light , searing in even through my closed eyelids . It felt as though I lay there between two and three years but could only  | have been a fraction of a second . The ladder was in place and I climbed down it , barking my shins well on the tumbled clutter of boxes . Rooting about like a mole in the darkness I kicked and pushed them through the entranceway ahead of me . The roar of great machines was loud behind me , joined a moment later by the sound of rapid firing weapons and the boom of explosions . " Perfect , " 1 panted , hurling the last of the boxes . " Weapons are meant to be used , so they are using them . I was sure they would be a trigger-happy bunch and I 'm most pleased to see my conclusions justified . " A louder boom announced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . I felt for the transmitter by the entrance and took it with me as I climbed up the ladder , at a much more leisurely pace . Standing comfortably on the ladder , with my elbows resting on the ground , I had the best seat for the performance . Jets roared and propellers thrashed from the sky above . Bullets sang and bombs exploded . The groundcar burned nicely , sending up angry spurts of flame whenever the wreck was strafed . As the banging and booming began to taper off I livened it up by pressing the first button on the transmitter . With a satisfying explosion of sound the rapidfire guns began to fire from the top of the Pot , while at occasional intervals rockets shot up out of the launcher . Every other round was tracer so the show was most impressive . The forces in the sky above zoomed away to regroup , then returned to the attack with savage vigor . The top of the Pot and the ground all about was torn with explosions . I had raided the Cliaand armory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same side shooting at itself . A bomb exploded no more than thirty meters from me and sand shook down my neck . This part of the show was over ; time for the finale . Sand was falling all around me as I dropped back to the bottom of the hole . With a certain amount of haste I pulled the ladder through the entrance , then tugged on the cables and darted inside . A good part of the sand I had dug out was piled above the entrance and held back by restraining boards . Now removed . I pushed the door shut as the sand slid down with sudden speed . Standing there in the darkness I counted slowly to ten to allow enough time for the landslide to completely fill the hole . Then I pressed the second button .  | Nothing happened . And this was an essential part of the operation . With all the bombs going off , the ground still shook with their vibration , one more explosion would not be noticed . The second button was to have triggered a buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seal my rat hole at the same time . If it did not go oil I would be easily found and dug out .. . Memory returned and I cursed my own foolishness . Of course I had made plans for this contingency . The radio signal from my little transmitter could not reach through the ground , I had known that . I groped for the flashlight I had left by the entrance , turned it on and saw the bare end of wire sticking through the wall . It was even labeled 2 so there would be no confusion if I were in a hurry . I was in a hurry . The explosions were dying away , presumably the mechanical enemy on the Pot had been destroyed , and if my explosion did not go off soon it would look very suspicious to say the least . I wrapped the end of the wire , it extended up to ground level , around the whip aerial on the transmitter and thumbed the button again . There was silence . Until a jarring explosion went off just overhead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . My concrete cave boomed like a drum and dirt and chips rattled down . I was safe . Snug as a roach in the rafters . I turned on the light and looked with pride on my residence for the next couple of weeks . Power supply , shielded of course , food , water , atmosphere renewal , everything a man might need . And the Solid state circuitry and devices that had arrived in the meteor . I would work and assemble my equipment and emerge ready to face the world . While the desert above was searched and quartered and the chase went further away . They would never think to look right under their noses , never ! I smiled and looked for a bottle to open to celebrate .  | No LONGI:n A ' ru ! I F I , nor a hider under rocks . On the 13th day I had unblocked illy door and dug my way back to the surface . With this syn-bolic act I lcf t behind my fugitive 's existence and entered Cliaaudian society . With assorted identification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roles in this rather repellent society until 1 knew far more about it than I really cared . In my various identities I only brushed the periphery of the military since I wanted to save my energies for a frontal assault there in full power . With this possibility I boarded an SST flight to Dosadanglup , the fair sized provincial city that happened to be situated adjacent to the military base of Glupost . From what I had been able to determine Glupost was also a major spaceship center and staging area for offworld expeditions . So there was more than chance to the fact that I loitered near enough to the seat reservation clerk to see who got what , and then asked for a seat next to a very attractive who . Attractive only to me , I hasten to add . By any other standard of measurement the flight-major would win no prizes . His jaw was too big , apparently designed to project into places where it was n't wanted , and it had a nasty little cleft built into it as though it had cracked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under simian shelving brows and the cavernous nostrils were twin furlined subway tunnels . I could not care less . I saw only the black uniform of the Space Armada , the many decorations signifying active service , and the wings-and-rocket of a senior pilot . He was my man . " Good evening , sir , good evening , " I said as I slipped into the seat next to him . " A pleasure to travel with you . " He aimed the twin cannons of his nose at me and fired a broadside snort that signaled a close to the recently opened conversation . I smiled in return and buckled my belt and was slammed back into the cushions as the SST hurled itself into the night sky . At cruising  | altitude most of the wing area slipped back into the hull and I took out my pocket flask and detached the two small cups . " It would be a pleasure to offer you a drink of refreshment , noble flight-major , in gratitude for your many services rendered to the glorious cause of Cliaand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but instead picked at his teeth with a none too clean pinky nail until he extracted a fragment of meat from his recent dinner . Close examination convinced him that it was too large to discard so he reingested it with a certain relish . A man of simple pleasures . I offered a better one . " Nothing too good for our boys in the service . This is narcolethe . " I sipped at the cup and smacked my lips . He looked directly at me for the first time and there should have been little splintering sounds as his lips loved slowly into an unaccustomed smile . " I 'll drink that , " he said in a grating voice , and well he should since the small flask of liqueur would have cost h im a month 's salary . Narcolethe , the finest drink known to mankind , distilled in small quantities from a scarce botanical on a minor planet at the galaxy 's rim . Soothing , charming , subtle , intoxicating , inspiring , aphrodisiac , stimulating . It was everything any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects and no hangover . He took the proffered cup and lowered the caverns of his nose over it and sipped . " Not bad , " he said , and I smiled at this crude understatement as though it were sincerest flattery and offered him the false name I had assumed . He thought about it and realized that an exchange was in order . " Flight-Major Vaska Hulja . " " The pleasure is mine , sir , the pleasure is mine . May I top that up for you , these cups are so small . " Very soon , as our razor nosed craft cracked the sound barrier and boomed through the sleep of the dozing citizens on the ground , I came to almost love the flight-major . He was perfect , all-around , with no bulges of doubt or pockmarks of uncertainty . Just as a spider is a perfect spider or a vampire bat a perfect vampire bat , he was a perfect freewheeling bastard . As his spirits lifted and his tongue grew thick the anecdotes became more detailed . The flightmajor on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals or small groups , it is overall effect that counts . Stay to plan , hit buildings and grouped vehicles , finish the run . On a second run it 's all right to hit groups of people , but only big ones , with firebombs . That spreads and splatters and gets the n-ost . " The flight-major on recreation : " There was just the two of us and we had maybe a dozen bottles and case of wNedstick , enough for couple of days , so we got these three girls , one as spare , you know , just in case , and took them . . The flight  --  najor on offworlders : " Animals . You ca n't tell me we can even interbreed with them . Obvious that Cliaand is source of all intelligent life in the universe and only civilizing influence . " There was more like this and I could only nod my head in rapt attention . Perfect , as I said . What had me almost pulsating with joy was the information that he had just been assigned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first visit to the immense base after years of duty on the fighting front . Destiny was controlling the fall of the dice . What I had to do next was dangerous and involved a great deal of risk  --  but the opportunity presented was too good to miss . In the weeks that I had been exploring the details of the Cliaand society I had come to know it in great depth . I thought . Now was the time to find out how much I really did know . For the part of society I had picked my way through was just the periphery , the non-military part and the military was the one that really counted . It dominated this world in every way and had managed to extend its dominance to other worlds as well . Despite the rules of logic , the inverse square , and history . I was going to have to apply my little bit of know-how to crack the final barrier . I was joining the army . Enlisting in the Space Armada . With the rank of flight-major . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into deed . " Must you report to duty at once , Vaska ? " Strong drink had put us on a first name basis . He shook his head in a shaggy no . " Tomorrow I am due . " " Wonderful . You do not wish to spend your last night of leave  | between the cold sheets of a solitary bed in the B.O.Q. Just think what else could be accomplished in the same time . " I went into some imaginary detail of what could be done with silken sheets in an unsolitary bed . Good food and fine drink were mentioned as well , but these were only of contingent interest . The flask tilted once more and he nodded cheerful agreement to my plan . As soon as we had landed and our baggage had been disgorged , a robocab took us to the Dosadan-Glup Robotnik . This was the local branch of a planet-wide chain of hotels that specialized in non-human service . Everything was mechanized and computerized . Human beings presumably visited them once in a while to check the gauges and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although I had used these hotels quite often , for many obvious reasons . I had occasionally seen other guests entering or leaving but we had avoided each other 's gaze like plague carriers . The Ilobotniks were islands of privacy in a sea of staring eyes . ' I'hcy had certain drawbacks , but I had long since learned to cope with these . ' 1'o the Robotnik we went . The front door opened automatically when we approached and a sort of motorized-dolly robot slipped out of its kennel and sang to us . " World famous since the day we opened , The Dosadan-Glup Robotnik welcomes you . I am here to take your luggage Order me and I 'll help you ! " This was sung in a rich contralto voice to the accompaniment of a zoo piece brass band ; a standard recording of all the Robotnik hotels . I hated it . I kicked the robot back , it was pressing close to our ankles , and pointed to the robocab . " Luggage . There . Five pieces . Fetch . " It hummed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the hotel . " Do n't we have four pieces luggage ? " Vaska asked , frowning those beetling eyebrows in thought . " You 're right , I must have miscounted . " The luggage robot caught up and passed us , with our suitcases and the back seat torn out of the cab . " We have five now . " " Good evening . . . gentlemen , " the robot at the desk murmured ,  | with a certain hesitation before the final word as it counted us and compared profiles in its memory bank . " How may we serve you ? " " The best suite in the house , " I said as I signed a fictitious name and address and began to feed ioo hoginje bills into the pay slot on the desk . Cash in advance was the rule at the Robotnik with any balance returned upon departure . A bellboy robot , armed with a key , rolled out and showed us the way , throwing the door wide with a blare of recorded trumpets as though it were announcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said and pressed the button labeled tip on its chest will ell atitoniatically deducted two boginjes from my credit balance . " Order us some drinks and food , " I told the flight-major , pointing to the menu built into the wall . " Anything you wish as long as there are steaks and champagne . " Ile liked that idea and he was busily punching buttons while I arranged the luggage . I also had a bug-detector strapped to my wrist which led me unerringly to the single optic-sonic bug . It was in the same place as every other one I had found , these hotels really were standardized , and I managed to move a chair in front of it when I opened my suitcase . The delivery door dilated and champagne and chilled glasses slid out . Vaska was still ordering away on the buttons and my credit balance , displayed in large numbers on the wall , was rolling rapidly backwards . I cracked the bottle , bouncing the cork off the wall near him to draw his inebriated attention , and filled the glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , handing him his glass and letting the little green pellet fall into it at the same time . " To Space Armada , " he said , draining the glass and breaking into some dreary chauvinistic song that I knew I would have to learn , all about shining blast-tubes , gleaming guns , men of valor , burning suns . I had enough of it even before he began . " You look tired , " I told him . " Are n't you sleepy ? " " Sleepy . . . " he agreed , his head bobbing . " I think it would be a good idea for you to lie down on the bed and get some rest before dinner . " " Lie down . . . " His glass fell to the rug and he stumbled across the room and sprawled full length on the nearest bed . " See , you were tired . Go to sleep and I 'll wake you later . " Obedient to the hypnodrug , he closed his eyes and began snoring  | at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detect nothing wrong . Dinner arrived , enough food to feed a squad  --  my money meant nothing to good old Vaska  --  and I ate a bit of steak and salad before going to work . I snapped open the kit and spread out the materials and tools . The first thing was of course an injection that acted as a nerve block and numbed all sensation in my face . As soon as this took effect I propped the snoring flight-major up and trained the reading light full in his face . This would not be a hard job at all . We both had about the same bony structure and build , and the resemblance did not have to be perfect . Just close enough to match the prisoncamp picture on his Ill card . The quality of this picture was what one learns to expect from an identification photo , looking more like a shaven ape than a human . The chin was the biggest job in every sense and massive injections of plastic jell built mine up to Vaska 's heroic size . I molded its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to work on the eyebrows . More plastic built up the brow ridges , and irnplanted black artificial hair drove home the resemblance . Contact lenses matched the color of his eyes and expanding rings in my nostrils flared them to the original 's cave-like size . All that rernained then was to transfer his fingerprints to the skintight and invisible plastic that covered my own fingers . Nothing to it . While I altered Vaska 's best uniform to a better fit for me he rose  --  as instructed  --  and ate some of the cold dinner . Sleep overcame him soon after that and this time he retired to the bed in the other room where his snores and grumbles would not annoy me . I mixed a stiff drink and retired early . The morrow would be a busy day in my new identity . I was going into the Space Armada . With a little luck I might get a clue as to the nature of their remarkable military powers .  | " I 'M sonny , silt , but you ca n't get in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The gate itself was made of riveted steel and was solidly set into a high stone wall capped with many strands of barbed wire . " What do you mean I ca n't get in ? I have been ordered to C:htpost , " I shouted in my best military-obnoxious manner . " Now press the button or whatever else you do to unlock that thing . " " I ca n't open it , sir , the base is sealed from the inside . I 'm stationed with the outside guard detail . " " I want to see your superior officer . " " Here I am , " a cold voice said in my ear . " What is this disturb-ance ? " When I turned around I looked at his lieutenant 's bar and he looked at my flight-major 's double cross and I won that argument . He led me to the guardhouse and there was a lot of calling back and forth on the TV phone until he handed it to me and I looked a steely-eyed colonel in the face . I had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight-major , " he said . " I have orders to report here , sir . " " You were to report here yesterday . You have overstayed your leave . " " I 'm sorry , sir , must have been an error in recording . My orders read report today . " I held them up and saw that the reporting date was the previous day . That drunkard Vaska had got me into the trouble he deserved himself . The colonel smiled with all the sweetness of a king cobra in rut . " If the mistake were in the orders , flight-major , there would certainly be no difficulty . Since the mistake was yours , lieutenant , we know where the error lies . Report to the security entrance . " I hung up the phone and the guard lieutenant , grinning evilly , handed me a set of lieutenant 's bars . I unclipped my double-crosses and accepted the humbler rank . I hoped promotion was as fast as demotion in the Space Armada . A guard detail marched me along  | the wall to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through . My credentials and orders were examined , my fingerprints taken , and in a few minutes I was through the last gate and inside the base of Glupost . A car was summoned , a private soldier took my bags , we drove to the officers ' quarters and I was shown to my room . And all the time I kept my eyes open . Not that there was anything fascinating to see . See one military base and you 've seen them all . Buildings , tents , chaps in uniform doing repetitious jumping , heavy expensive equipment all painted the same color , that sort of thing . What I had to find out would not be that easy to uncover . My bags were dumped in the tiny room , salutes exchanged , the soldier left , and a voice spoke hoarsely from the other had . " You do n't happen to have a drink on you , do you ? " I looked closely and saw that what I at first thought was a bundle of crumpled blankets now appeared to contain it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking must have exhausted him and he groaned , adding another breath of alcoholic vapor to the already rich atmosphere of the room . " It so happens that I do , " I said , opening the window . " My name is Vaska . Do you prefer any particular brand ? " " Otrov . " I could think of no drink by that title so presumably it was my roommate 's name . Taking the flask with the most potent beverage from my collection I poured him half a glass . He seized it with trembling fingers and drained it while shudders racked his frame . It must have done some good because he sat up in bed and held out the glass for more . " We blast off in two days , " he said , sniffing his drink . " This really is n't paint remover , is it ? " " No , it just smells that way to fool the MP 's . Where to ? " " Do n't make jokes so early in the morning . You know we never know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you with secu-rity ? " He blinked suspiciously in my direction : I would have to watch the questions until I knew more . I forced a smile and poured a drink for myself . " A joke . I do n't feel so good myself . I woke up a flight-major this morning . . .  | " And now you 're a lieutenant . Easy come , easy go . " " They did n't come that easy ! " " Sorry . Figure of speech . I 've always been a lieutenant so I would n't know how the others feel . You could n't just tip a little more into this glass ? Then I 'll be able to dress and we can get over to the club and get into some serious drinking . It 's going to be awful , all those weeks without drink until we get back . " Another fact . The ( ; 1iaand fought their battles refreshed with water . I wondered if I could . I sipped and the disturbing thought that had been poking at me for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel and would be discovered . And I could do nothing about it because I was in this sealed base . Some of the drink went down the wrong pipe and I coughed and Otrov beat me on the back . " I think it really is paint remover , " he said gloomily when I had stopped gasping , and began to dress . As we walked to the officers ' club I was in no mood for communication , which Otrov probably blamed on my recent demotion . What to do ? Drink seemed to be in order , it was n't noon yet , and it would be wisest to wait until evening to crack out of the base . Face the problems as they arose . Right now I was in a perfect position to imbibe drink with my new peer group and gather information at the same time . Which , after all , was the reason that I was here in the first place . Before leaving I had slipped a tube of killalc pills into my pocket . One of these every two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grab onto and neutralize most of the alcohol as soon as it hit the stomach . I would drink deep and listen . And stay sober . As we walked through the garish doorway of the club I slipped one out and swallowed it . It was all rather depressing , particularly since I was sloshing the stuff down my throat as fast as I could drink it and buying rounds for the others and not feeling it at all . As the afternoon went on and thirsts increased other officers appeared in the club and there were soon a dozen other pilots crowded around our free-spending table . All drinking well and saying little of any interest . " Drink , drink , " I insisted . " Won it gambling . Do n't need it where we 're going , " and bought another round . There was a great deal said , as one might well imagine , about the  | flying characteristics of various ships and I filed all relevant details . And much mumbling over old campaigns , I dived from 50,000 , planted the bombs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing remarkable about all this was the unsullied record of victories . I knew the Cliaand armed forces were good , but looking at this collection of drunks almost made it impossible to believe they could be that good . But apparently they were . There were endless boasting tales of victory after victory and nothing else , and after a period I too came to believe . These boys were good and the Space Armada of Cliaand a winner . It was all too depressing . By evening there was a literal falling away of the original drinkers , though their places at the table were filled quickly enough . When one of them slid to the floor the servants would gently carry him off . I realized that I was the last of the originals so no one would notice if I also made an exit in this apparently traditional manner . Letting my eyes close I sank deep into my chair , hoping this would do since I did not relish a trip to the debris littered floor . It took them some minutes to notice I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hard hands caught me at knees and armpits and I was hauled off . When the footsteps had rattled away I opened my eyes to a sort of dim chamber whose walls were lined with bunks . Nearby me was the gaping 0 of Otrov 's mouth , snoring away in his cups . As were the others . No one noticed when I pulled on my gloves and went to the door that opened into the company street and let myself out . It was almost dark and I had to leave the camp and I had not the slightest idea of how I could do it . The gates were impossible . I strolled along the wall to the first one . Sealed and bolted shut , solid steel , with a brace of guards to see that the locks were n't tampered with . I walked on . There were guards every hundred paces or so along the wall and I assumed that there were an equal or greater number of electronic safeguards as well . As evening approached searchlights were turned on that illuminated the outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Admittedly all this was to keep anyone from getting in  --  but it worked equally well in the opposite direction . I walked on , trying to fight off the black depression that still threatened to overwhelm me . I passed through a medium sized atmosphere craft area , two crossed runways and some hangars , with a collection of  | lumbering jet transports standing about . For a moment I considered stealing one of these  --  but where would I land without being captured ? I had to be in this city tonight , not zipping off to parts unknown . Beyond the aircraft was a high chain metal fence that cut off the spaceship area . Getting in there would be easy enough  --  but what would it accomplish ? I could see the same high outer wall stretching off into the distance . There was a rumble in the sky and bright lights lanced down . I turned around and watched , sunk in gloom , as a delta wing fighter settled in heavily for a landing . It looked like one of the same type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squealed when it was hit and the jets roared with reverse thrust ? and I was running forward even while the idea was half-formed in my mind . Madness ? Perhaps . But in my line of business , crookery , you learn to rely on hunches and trained reflexes . And while I ran the parts all fell into place and I saw that this was It . Sweet , fast , clean and dangerous . The way I liked things . I took a false moustache out of my pocket and fixed it on my lip as I ran . The jet turned and taxied off to a hardstand and I trotted after it . A car came out to meet it and a crew of mechanics began to service the jet . One of them unloaded a ladder and placed it next to the cockpit as the top of the canopy opened like an alligator 's mouth . I ran a little faster as the pilot climbed down and made for the car . He was just climbing in when I came stumbling up and he returned my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the golden crescent of a major on his collar . " Excuse me , sir , " I gasped , " but the commandant asked me to make sure you had the papers . " " What the hell are you talking about ? " he grumbled , sliding into his seat . He sounded tired . I climbed into the back . " Then you do n't know . Oh , God ! Driver  --  get going as fast as possible . " The driver did , since that was his job , and I slipped the tube out of the holder in my hip pocket . When we were out of sight of the jet I raised it to my lips . " Major . . . " I said , and he turned his head and grunted . I puffed . He grunted caught him before he fell . " Driver  --  stop ! Something has happened to the major " The driver , obviously not a man of much imagination , took a quick look at the slumped figure and hit the brake . As soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was happy to see , I let him have a second narco-dart and he went off to join the major in dreamland . I laid them both on the ground and stripped off the officer 's flying suit and helmet . With a little bit of struggling I managed to pull the things over my own uniform , then strapped on the helmet and pulled the tinted goggles down over my eyes . All of this took less than a minute . I left the dozing pair in each other 's arms and headed the car back to the plane . So far so good . But this had been the easiest part . I stood on the brakes so that the car screeched , bucked and skidded to a stop on t he hardstand . " Emergency ! " I shouted , leaping from the car and running to the ladder . " Unhook this thing so I can take on . " The mechanics merely gaped at me , making no move towards the umbilical wires and hoses that connected the plane to the servicing pit . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any boot to move him in the right direction . He got the message clearly and the others now understood as well . They went to work . All except a grizzled noncom with a sleeve covered with hashmarks and stripes and a face covered with suspicion . He rolled over and looked me up and down . " This is Major Lopta 's personal plane , sir . Have n't you made a mistake ? " " Not as big a mistake as you are making interfering with me . How long has it been since you were a private ? " He looked at me in thought for a moment , then turned away without another word . I headed for the plane . As I climbed the ladder I saw that the noncom was busy at the radio in the car . This was a mistake on my part ; I should have done something about that radio . As I was getting into the cockpit he dropped the radio and bellowed . " Stop that man ! He has no orders for this flight . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put my foot on his chest and pushed . I sent the ladder after him and dropped into the seat .  | This situation had rapidly developed in a direction that was not to my liking . I had planned on having enough time to familiarize myself with the controls before I fired up the engines ; although I had plenty of jet hours I had never been in a Cliaandian one before . Not only did n't I know where the starter was but I did some pretty desperate funihling before I even found the switch for the instrument lights . As I flicked it on the ladder smacked back against the side of the plane . I hated old efficient noncoms , the backbone of the military . Now I had to take out time to open the flying suit and grope inside it for my pockets . A few happy-gas and sleep grenades cleared away the mechanics for the moment . Some lay cheerfully unconscious while the others laughed themselves sick . The noncom had cowardly stayed out of range and was back on the radio again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knob with PALJENJE on it . When I slapped it the jets whined and rumbled to life . A rocket slug crashed through the open canopy above my head and I ducked , cursing . As I kicked in the throttle I saw the noncom kneeling to take careful aim . The plane began to move  --  slowly . His gun flared again and I felt the vibration as the slug buried itself in the seat . Which was probably armored . My first bit of luck . I flipped the tail so it pointed at the gunman , which put the armor between me and him and gave him a good blast of jet exhaust in the face . The plane bucked and shuddered and moved forward again  --  and I saw the torn fuel hose flapping in the windstream and pumping out its vital juices . Those idiots had n't disconnected it ! I did n't know where the fuel gauge was on the cluttered instrument board , nor did I want to look at it . Logic told me that gravity would bleed the fuel out a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but logic had nothing to do with this . I had a vision of the jets dying out here in the middle of the field while the forces of the enemy closed in around me . I could feel my blood pressure going up like an express elevator . My busy little noncom friend was obviously still working on the radio , because when I turned onto the runway I saw that some trucks were moving into position to block it and something that looked suspiciously like an armored car was roaring up in the background . I cut the throttle back almost all the way and ducked my head down to read the instrument panel again .  | What I was looking for was n't there ! Then I noticed another bank of switches on one side and painfully spelled out their dim messages in the bad light . ISBACIVANJE . There it was ! I looked up and saw that I was about to crash into the first truck . Men were bailing out and running in all directions . My feet paddled about as I groped for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I finally found the brakes , stood on the right one and did a shuddering turn . About a half meter of wing tip tore off on the front of the truck . There was the orange blast of a gun as someone fired at me , but I have no idea where the slug went . Then the jet was around and I was belting back in the opposite direction . This time at full throttle . The runway lights were streaming by , faster and faster , and I had to keep one hand on the wheel while I groped for the belts and harnesses with the other . One of the buckles was missing and the end of the runway was coming up before I found out that I was sitting on it . I clicked it into place and grabbed the wheel with both hands as I ran out of runway . The jet did not have flying speed . The nose was mushy and would not lift when I pulled back on it . Then I was bumping across the graded dirt heading straight for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Faster and faster to a certain collision . 9 THE TIMING had to be just right . Too early or too late would be just as disastrous . When the wall loomed up above the jet and I could see the joints between the blocks I figured it was about right and I hit the eject button . Barn ! The sequence was almost too fast to follow  --  but it worked . A transparent shutter snapped down over my face , the still tilted up canopy blew away with a crack of explosives , and the seat slammed up so hard against me that it felt like my spine had shortened to  | half its length . Almost in slow motion I sailed up and out of the jet and , for a hideously long second , saw the raw stone of the wall directly in front of me . Then I was over with only the dark sky ahead . At the highest point in my arc there was another sharp crack at my back and I looked up to see the white column of the parachute swirling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some buildings looked very close below . The chute opened with a rustling snap , the seat pushed up against inc w and , a moment after this jarring deceleration , the wall of a building was rushing past and the seat hit the ground and rolled over . The chute settled slowly down and draped me in its enveloping folds . I am chagrined to report that I did nothing at all at that moment . Events had moved even faster than I had planned and this final bit had been simply stunning . I gaped and gasped and shook my head and finally had enough sense to bang the quick release and throw off the harness straps . After that I kept my head down and crawled and finally got out from under the chute . A man and a woman had stopped on the opposite side of the street and were goggling in my direction . No one else was in sight . The only sign of activity seemed to be coming from the other side of the great black wall that loomed behind me . Flames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loud popping of burning ammunition . Lovely . " Testing new equipment , " I called out to the spectators and turned and trotted out of sight around the corner . In a dark doorway I stripped off the flying suit and dropped the helmet on top of it . Unidentified and free I strolled away towards the Robotnik . Brilliantly conceived , Jim I told myself and gave myself a little pat on the shoulder . . At the same moment I realized that now that I was out of the base I would have to find a way to get back in before dawn , but I pushed this depressing revelation out of sight . First things first . I had to dispose of the real Vaska Hulja in order to take over his identity . He was stirring when I came in , thrashing about in the bed and rocking his head back and forth . The hypnotic trance was wearing thin and he was fighting against it . Not that the robot cleaner was  | helping . It had dusted and cleaned the room and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I booted the thing in its cow . BACK LATER button and ordered dinner for two . To take Vaska 's subconscious mind off his troubles I gave him the strong suggestion that he had gone two days without eating and that this was the best meal he had ever had in his lifetime . He smacked and chortled and gurgled with delight while he ate ; I just picked at my food . In the end I pushed it away and ordered Strong Drink in the hopes that the alcohol would stimulate or depress my thoughts into some coherent plan . What was I to do with my companion here , happily shoveling food into his gaping gob ? His existence was a constant threat to my existence ; there was room enough for only one Vaska Hulja in the scheme of things . Kill him ? That would be easy enough . Dismember him in the bathtub and feed the parts and gallons of blood into an easily constructed arc furnace until I was left with a handful of dust . It was tempting , he had certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call this justice . But not tempting enough . Cold-blooded killing is just not my thing . I 've killed in selfdefense , I 'll not deny that , but I still maintain an exaggerated respect for life in all forms . Now that we know that the only thing on the other side of the sky is more sky , the idea of an afterlife has finally been slid into the history books alongside the rest of the quaint and forgotten religions . With heaven and hell gone we are faced with the necessity of making a heaven or hell right here . What with societies and metatechnology and allied disciplines we have come a long way , and life on the civilized worlds is better than it ever was during the black days of superstition . But with the improving of here and now comes the stark realization that here and now is all we have . Each of us has only this one brief experience with the bright light of consciousness in that endless dark night of eternity and must make the most of it . Doing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most criminal act imaginable is the terminating of one of these conscious existences . The Cliaandians did not think this way , which was why I intensely enjoyed dropping gravel in their gearboxes , but I still did . Which meant that I could n't take the easy way out of reducing gravystained Vaska to his component molecules . If I did this I would be no better than they and I would be getting into the old game of the  | ends justifying the means and starting on that downward track . I sighed , sipped , and the diagrams I had been visualizing for an arc furnace faded and vanished . Well what then ? I could chain him in a cave with an automatic food dispenser if I had a cave and so forth . Out . Given time and hard work I could alter his appearance and plant false memories that would last at least six months and get him into a prison or a work gang or a mental home or such . Except I did not have the time for anything this complex . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to abandon all the work I had already done in creating the false Vaska and having him accepted . They were probably getting involved in roll calls right now so I really should be thinking about ways of getting back into Glupost rather than worrying about my swinish companion . I noticed his stomach beginning to bulge so I turned off his appetite . He sat back and sighed and belched , with good reason . There was a rustling on the far wall as a panel slid back and the robot cleaner trundled in . " May I give you a good cleaning ? " it whispered in a sexy contralto voice . I told it what it could do , but it was n't equipped to take this kind of instruction and only clicked and whirred until I ordered it to go to work . I watched it gloomily as it bustled about and made the bed  --  and the first spark of an idea began to glimmer in the darkness . Vaska had stayed in the Robotnik for an entire day without any trouble . How long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever if enough money were deposited to the room 's account . But he could not be kept subjugated by hypnosis for more than a day or two if I were not there to reinforce the suggestion . Or could he . . . ? I would have to find the control center of the hotel before I could make any final decisions . But this could be the right idea . I left Vaska watching an historical space opera on TV , with the suggestion that this was the finest entertainment he had ever witnessed , which might possibly be the truth . Loaded with instruments and tools I went on the prowl . There would be a serviceway for the robots behind the rooms , but it was undoubtedly small , dark and dusty . That was a last resort . As mechanized as this hotel was , human beings had built it and could repair it if they had to . A quick prowl of the lower hallways near the entrance uncovered a con-  | cealed door with a disguised keyhole . It was flush with the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain the fiction that the Robotnik was a hundred percent robot run . I spent more time with my instrumentation , making sure there were no bugs on the door , than I did opening it . The lock was a joke . There was no one in sight when I slipped through the door and closed it behind me . I felt like a roach inside a radio . Electronic components hung , projected and bulged out on all sides ; cables and wires looped and sagged in a profusion of electric spaghetti . Rolls of tape clicked and whirred on the computers , relays opened and closed , and gear trains chattered . It was a very busy place . I worked my way through it examining the labels and stepping over the little hutches where off duty robots rested , until I found what might be called a control center . There was even a chair here before a console , that was designed for the human form , and I dropped into it . And set to work . I had been mulling my new plan over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to ** done . First , the electronic bugs in Vaska 's room . I did not want him observed or listened to . The bugging circuits were easy enough to find and there was even a monitor screen that could be connected to any of them . I tested this out and apparently there was a bug in every room in the hotel and some interesting things were going on , but I have never been much of a voyeur , preferring participation to observation , and a married man now as well . And time was passing quickly . All of the bugging circuits came together into a cable that vanished through the wall , to the local police station or other government bureau . Which gave me the idea . I had no time to fix a tape and soundtrack that would pump phoney information into the bugging circuit , I had to improvise . This was done easily enough by feeding the signal from the bugging circuit of another room into the wire from the room Vaska was occupying . From the way this setup was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch only one room at a time , for reasons best known to the people who built it . There was about one chance in ten thousand that it would ever be noticed that the same signal was coming from two rooms . And these odds were good enough for me . Over half of the rooms were empty in any case , which improved the odds even more . Vaska could neither be seen nor heard now . The room and as-  | sociated pleasures had to be paid for , but before I left I would deposit enough money ( all stolen ) to last a year if needs be . A way to keep him in the room for that length of time was now needed and I  --  with my usual fertile imagination and basically nasty nature  --  had already devised that scheme . A small tape recorder was wired into the speaker circuit for the room , a timer attached , and the whole device concealed in the maze of other circuits and components . I programmed the tape , set the timer and started it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room to watch my creation begin its job . Vaska still had his eyes glued to the TV screen , panting with passion as mighty spaceships locked in frenzied destruction . Blaster cannon sizzled and ravening energies raved , and through this cut my recorded voice . " Now here this , Vaska , now hear this . You have had a long day and you are sleepy . You are yawning . You are going to turn off the lights and retire now , to sleep the sound sleep of the blessed for tomorrow is another day . " And that was the big lie . For tomorrow would not be another day , not for dear Vaska . It was going to be the same one all over again . He would be lulled into a deep sleep and an even deeper trance by my soothing voice . And while there it would be explained to him that he would forget this day so he could wake up on the morning of his last day of leave before reporting for active duty . He would wake up with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make an easy day of it . Just lie around the hotel room , read a bit , eat some food , watch TV , and retire early . He would enjoy himself . He would enjoy himself the same way every day until the program was broken . It was a wonderful plan and as foolproof as possible . I fed over half of my liquid funds into the paying hopper and the balance of the wall indicator shot up to an enormous number . Slowly and happily , I reached out and hung the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the outside of the door . And then I got depressed and turned the lights back on and looked around for the bottle that had provided me with so much inspiration so far . Vaska was well taken care of . But how did I get back into the thrice-guarded and now doubly wakeful military base ?  | That high stone wall loomed as large in my brain as it did in reality . I had made a fuss going over it and alerted everyone . It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under it perhaps . Out of the question , digging and earth moving and things like that could not be accomplished in a few hours . Steal a plane , fly over , parachute in ? And be shot down before I hit the ground . There could be no worse time than the present to try to enter or leave the base . The guards would be suspicious and reinforced and the place crawling with troops . Which of course gave me the clue as to what I had to do . Turn their strength against them , use their own numbers to defeat them , judo on a giant basis . But how ? The answer came quickly enough once the problem had been correctly stated . I put together the eciuii ) n1ent I would need , it was quite bulky , then stowed it all into a Loge suitcase and fitted the suitcase with a destruct apparatus . A disguise would be needed , nothing complex , just something to hide my cal-assumed identity . Ahh , the levels of deception we must cuter into . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into my pocket to be replaced by a floppy black hat , and my old faithful gray heard muzzled my face in anonymity . I was ready . I took a deep breath and a small drink and slipped out , locking the door behind me and pocketing the key . As I went out I slipped this into a waste chute and the flare of instant destruction brightened my way . Going a good distance from the hotel I signaled and a robocab stopped and I heaved in my suitcase . " Main entrance , Glupost base , " I ordered and away we went . Madness ? Perhaps . But it was the only way . Not that I did n't have a trapped butterfly or two beating for release from my stomach . This was only to be expected as we rolled up the approach street under the high lights , towards the suspicious and heavily armed guards who stood about fondling their weapons . Dawn was already lightening the sky . " The base is closed ! " a lieutenant shouted , pulling open the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Base , " I quavered in a very bad imitation of an old man 's falsetto . " Is n't this the Carrot Juice Center for Natural Health ? This cal ) has done me wrong ... " The officious lieutenant snorted through his nostrils and turned  | away  --  and I rolled a pair of gas grenades out through his bowed legs . And heaved five more after them . As the first ones went off I pulled the gas mask down out of my hat and slapped it over my face , beard and all . My but things got busy . The grenades were a fine mixture of blackout gas , smoke and happygas . Blind , laughing , cursing , coughing men stumbled about on all sides and a few guns went off . I worked my way through their confused ranks , sowing more confusion as I went , and up to the main gates and put down my suitcase and opened it . The shaped charges had adhesive bases and stuck to the steel of the gate when I slapped them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces of shrapnel tore at my flapping coat . I hit the ground . Tearing out two smoke grenades and dropping them behind me . Just as the smoke roiled up I had a quick glimpse of a squad coming up on the double , still outside the gassed area , firing as they came . Two more blackout gas bombs in that direction helped a lot . Now , as much in the dark as everyone else , I pushed in the caps by touch and linked them with fuse wire to the radio igniter . Time was passing too quickly . They were alert inside the gate now and would be waiting for me . But I had come too far to back out . I closed the suitcase , again by touch , grabbed it up and inched my way along the wall and pressed the transmitter switch in my pocket . Explosions banged out in the darkness and were followed by the clang of steel . Hopefully an opening had been blasted in the gate . I stumbled back towards it with all the sounds of bedlam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALL RIGHT , with glimpses of lights on the other side as the smoke cloud roiled through it . There were troops there  | too because a hail of small arms fire clanged against the door with some chance slugs coming through the new-blasted opening . Screams sounded behind me as someone was hit . The fools were shooting each other , helping to spread the confusion I had sown . Keeping out of the line of fire from inside the gate I hurled grenade after grenade through and , when the smoke was at its thickest there , went through myself as fast and low as I could . It really sounded great . Sirens were moaning , men shouting , weapons barking : the voices of utter confusion . I threw more grenades in all directions , throwing them as far as I could to widen the area of cover , until only a half dozen were left . These I saved for possible emergencies , which were sure to emerge , jamming them into my coat pockets . The self-destruct on the suitcase had a five second delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite direction . I crept along the wall , my only point of reference in the blackout , towards the guardhouse I had noticed when I had first examined the gate . There had heel ' a clutch of vehicles parked there  --  at the time  --  and 1 niuttered prayers that at least one of them still remained . The cloud thinned and I hurled two more grenades ahead of me . In the darkness I heard a motor start up . Forgetting caution , I ran . Someone slammed into me and fell heavily but I kept my feet and stumbled on . Then I tripped over a curb and did fall , but did a quick roll and came up running minus my hat . The engine was louder and then I saw the squarish van just beyond the edge of the smoke cloud . It was turning to start down the road and I threw two of my remaining four grenades as far ahead of it as I could . The driver hit the brakes as the mushrooming clouds sprang out , then I was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's white , cap and all , and I reached out and dragged him to me , landing a swift right cross on his gaping jaw as he went by . Then I was in the driver 's seat and pushing the thing into gear and jumping the deadweight of the vehicle forward as fast as I could , letting the door swing shut with the sudden acceleration . Once out of the smoke I saw that daylight had arrived . Well done , I congratulated myself , then slowed down to avoid being conspicuous . More soldiers were coming down the street towards me , running at the double , so I slipped down as far as I could and began to tug at the gray beard . It was just about time to resume my Vaska identity .  | A ringing pain possessed the side of my head and I fell over , shouting aloud at the sudden agony , pulling on the steering tiller as I went . The van rushed at the squad of soldiers who scattered in all directions . Something shiny flashed in the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow caught me on the shoulder and was scarcely felt through all the clothing . A white clad arm holding a heavy pot projected in from the rear of the truck . I jammed the steering tiller hard over and the arm vanished from sight as its owner fell . In the rush I had forgotten there might be others in the van . Just before the truck a frightened officer was spread-eagled against the wall . I pushed the tiller again and narrowly avoided him and we had a good look at each other as the van rushed by . He was sure to be impressed by my gas mask and beard and would instantly report it on his radio . Time was running out . Arm and pot reappeared and I chopped the wrist with the edge of my hand and gained possession of the pot . As soon as I had whipped the van around another corner , foot hard down on the throttle now , I threw the pot back to its owner with a blackout grenade inside , silencing at least this source of trouble for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ van , gently touched the growing knot on my head , and noticed a brace of armored vehicles that appeared in the road ahead and turned in my direction . Buildings rushed by and I braked and turned into the next crossroad . The van was becoming more of a liability than an asset and I had to get rid of it . But what then ? I did not want to be found away from my quarters , this would bring instant suspicion , and the officers ' buildings were in the opposite direction . But the officers ' club was not too far away in the recreation area . Could I get there ? Was it possible that the unconscious drunks of the previous evening 's festivities still lay on the bunks where I had left them ? This was too good a chance to miss , because if I could get back into my bunk I would certainly not be suspect . This was close enough . There were vehicles coming towards me ? and undoubtedly more behind me  --  but none close for the moment . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stop and hit the ground running . Shedding my disguise as I went , coat , beard , gas mask marking the trail behind me . I stuffed the remaining grenade into my pocket , pulled on my cap , squared my shoulders in a mil-  | tary manner , and strolled around the corner . A squad of soldiers were pouring out of barracks and forming ranks , but they ignored me , just another uniform among uniforms . The officers ' club was not too far away . Two more corners and there it was . The front door sealed , but I knew the bunkroom entrance would be open . Just as I was about to turn the corner I heard the men talking and I held back . " Is that all ? " " Just a few more , sir , a couple that are hard to wake up . And one who wo n't get out of his bunk . " " I 'll talk to him . " I took a quick look , then drew back . I was too late . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soldiers were milling about . guiding hungover officers to a waiting truck . One of the officers was sitting on the ground , holding his head and ignoring the soldiers who were trying to entice him into the waiting transportation . Another was flipping his cookies against the wall of the building . Think quickly , diGriz , time is running out . I bounced the last smoke grenade in my palm , then flipped the actuator with my thumb . If I could join the drunk team I would be safe ; it would be worth the risk . I stepped around the corner , arm back , and no one was looking in my direction ; with a quick heave I threw the grenade over the truck as far as it would go . It exploded nicely , thud , boom , clouds of smoke and startled cries from the soldiery . And everyone looking in the same direction . Eight fast paces took me up behind them , to the seated officer who mumbled unhappily to himself , ignoring all else . I bent over , agreeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . Then the soldiers were helping me , holding me as well since I seemed none too steady on my feet , guiding us both to the waiting truck . I tripped and almost fell and they caught and righted me . Now the stage was set  --  because there was one more thing I had to do . The cook in the truck would report that he had hit the spy on the head . So the word would be out to look for a head wound  --  like the one I had . I could n't get rid of the knob on the side of my skull , but I could camouflage it . It would be painful , but it was necessary .  | The soldiers helped me to the first step and I started up . As soon as they let go I missed the next step  --  and plummeted over backwards between them cracking my head on the ground . I hit harder than I had planned and the blow on my already sore noggin felt like molten lead had been poured on it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recovered I was sitting up with blood running down the side of my face  --  I had n't planned that but it certainly made a nice touch  --  and a soldier was running up with a first aid kit . I was bandaged and calmed and this time helped all the way into the truck : I felt awful which was fine . With dragging feet I groped my way to the far end , as far from the entrance as I could get , where a voice called out hollowly to me . " Vaska . . . " It changed to a hollow coughing . My roommate Otrov was there , looking rumpled and miserable . " You do n't have a drink ? " he asked , his usual morning salutation . I gave him sympathy , if not beverage , during our brief ride . There were aggrieved cries when the wheeled drunk tank was unloaded and the officers saw that they had not been returned to their quarters , but had been brought instead to one of the administration buildings . I complained along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . Someone had escaped from the Glupost base , someone else had entered . Every head would have to be counted until the missing and/or extra party could be found . We were guided , stumbling , into a waiting area , to be called out one by one to confer with a battery of tired clerks . While we waited there was a brisk amount of business back and forth to the latrine and I joined the queue . Mainly to leave a little soap on my fingers when I washed my hands , so I could rub some of it into my eyes . It burned like acid , but I let it stay for a moment before I rinsed it out . My eyes glared back at me from the mirror like twin coals of fire . Perfect . On cue , I found the clerk , showed my identification and had my name checked off on a roster . I hoped , like all the others , that we would be allowed to leave soon . Many of them had gone to sleep on the benches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strenuous night . What better disguise for the spy than sleeping in the heart of the enemy ? It was the sudden silence that shook me awake . I had been lulled  | off by the grumbles and complaints of my fellow officers , the coming and going of soldiers , the busy whir of office machines . These noises had all stopped , and had been replaced by silence . Through the silence , first distant , then louder and louder , came the sound of a single set of footsteps approaching slowly and steadily . They came towards me  --  and passed by , and I kept my eyes closed and forced myself to breathe regularly . Only when they were well past did I open my eyes a crack . I wondered at the silence . All I saw was the back of the man , a nondescript back slightly bent , a wrinkled uniform of unimpressive pale gray and a cap of the same fabric . I could not recall seeing this particular uniform before . I wondered what the fuss was about . Yawning , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching as the man reached the end of the room and turned to face us all . He was no more prepossessing Irons the front than from the back . Sandy hair getting a little thin on tojp , an incipient roll of fat and double chin , clean shaven with an uonn  --  niorable face . Yet when he spoke , in the tones of a stern schoolmaster , till of the veteran officers present remained dead silent . " You officers , the few among you who were sober enough that is , may have heard an explosion and seen a cloud of smoke while you were on the way here . This explosion was caused by an individual who entered this base and is still undetected in our midst . We know nothing about him , but suspect that he is an offworld spy .. . This drew a gasp and a murmur as might be expected and the gray man waited a moment until he continued . " We are making an intensive search for this individual . Since you gentlemen were in the immediate vicinity I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find out what you might know . I also may discover ... which one of you is the missing spy . " This last shaft exacted only a shocked silence . Now that he had everyone in the right mental condition for cross-examining the gray man began calling officers forward one at a time . I was doubly grateful for the foresight that had dropped me off the truck onto the side of my head . It was no accident that I was the third man called forward . On what grounds ? General resemblance in build to the offworld spy Pas Ratunkowy ? My delayed arrival at Glupost ? The bandage ?  | Some basis of suspicion must have existed . I dragged forward with slow speed just as the others had done . I saluted and he pointed to the chair next to the desk . " ' Why do n't you hold this while we talk , " he said in a reasonable voice , passing over the silver egg of a polygraph transmitter . The real Vaska would not have recognized it , so I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  as though I did not know it was traiisnnitting vital information to the lie detector before him  --  and clutched it in my haul . My thoughts were not as calm . I 'm caught ! Ile has me ! Ile knows who I am and is just toying with me ! lie looked deep into my bloodshot eyes and I detected a slight curl of distaste to his mouth . " You have had quite a night of it , Lieutenant Hulja , " he said quietly , his eyes on the sheaf of papers  --  and on the lie detector readout as well . " Yes sir , you know . . . having a few last drinks with the boys " That was what I said aloud . What I thought was They will shoot me , dead , right through the heart ! and I could visualize that vital organ spouting my life 's blood into the dirt . " I see you recently had your rank reduced  --  and where are your fuses , Pas Ratunkowy ? " Am I tired . . . wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir ? " I blinked my red orbs and reached to scratch my head and touched the bandage and thought better of it . His eyes glared into mine , gray eyes almost the color of his uniform , and for a moment I caught the strength and anger behind his quiet manners . " And your head wound  --  where did you get that ? Our offworld spy was struck on the side of the head . " " I fell , sir , someone must have pushed me . Out of the truck . The soldiers bandaged it , ask them ... " " I already have . Drunk and falling down and a disgrace to the officer corps . Get away and clean yourself up , you disgust me . Next man . " " I climbed unsteadily to my feet , not looking into the steady glare of those cold eyes , and stared off as though I had forgotten the device in my hand , then turned back and dropped it on his desk , but  | he was bent over the papers and ignoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin hair of his balding crown . I left . Fooling a polygraph takes skill , practice and training . All of which I had . It can only he done in certain circumstances and this one had been ideal . A sudden interview without normalizing tests being run on the subject . Therefore I began the interview in a near panic  --  before any questions had been asked . All of this must have peaked nicely on his graph . I was afraid . Of him , of something , anything . But when he had asked the loaded question meant to uncover a spy  --  the question I knew was coming  --  I had relaxed and the readout had shown this . The question was a meaningless one to anyone but the offworlder . Once he saw this the interview was over , he had plenty more to do . Otrov was sitting up , cold sober , eyes as big as plates when I came back and dropped onto the bench next to him . " What did he want ? " IIe spoke in , i bellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inc something or other that I did n't know about and then it was over . " " I hope he does n't want to talk to me . " " Who is he ? " " Do n't you know ! " With shocked incredulity . I tread warily , covering my complete lack of information . " Well you know I just came here ... " " But everyone knows Kraj . " " Is that him . . . ? " I gasped it out and tried to look as frightened as he did and it seemed to work , because he nodded and looked over his shoulder and quickly back again . I rose and went to the latrine again to terminate the conversation at this spot . Everyone knew about Kraj . Who was Kraj ?  | EMHARKIN ( : iou ' I III% INVASION came as a relief to everyone ; better a nice quiet var thall the suspicions and fears that swept the Glupost base ( luring the following days . There were sudden inspections , nlicluigilt searches , constant alarms and the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been proud of my efforts at sowing the seeds of disorder if I had not been a victim of that disorder at the same time . The invasion plans must have gone ahead too far to alter because , in the midst of all the excitement , we still adhered to schedule . On B Day minus two all the bars closed so that the sobering up process of the troops could begin . A few reluctant ones , myself and Otrov included , had concealed bottles which carried us a bit further , but even this ended when our lockers and bags were put into storage and we were issued pre-packed invasion kits . I had a small can of powdered alcohol disguised as tooth powder that I was saving for an emergency and the emergency instantly presented itself as the thought of the coming weeks without drink , so Otrov and I finished the tooth powder on B Day minus one and that was that . After one last midnight spot check and search we were assembled and marched to the departure area . The fleet , row after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were called out , one at a time , and sent to our assigned places . In the beginning I had thought that this was a rather stupid way to run an invasion . No plans , no diagrams , no peptalk , no training , no maneuvers  --  no nothing . It finally dawned on me that this was the ideal way to mount an invasion that you wished to keep secret . The pilots had plenty of piloting experience , and would get more on the outward voyage . The troops were ready to fight ; the sources of supply supplied . And somewhere at the top there were locked boxes of plans , course tapes and such . None of which would be opened until we were safe in warpdrive and outside communication would be impossible . All of which made life easier for  | me since there were few opportunities to trip me up in my knowledge of things C'liaandian . It was with a great deal of pleasure that I found myself assigned as pilot of a troop transport . This was a role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a roommate had not been accidental either , because Otrov climbed into the navroom a few minutes later and announced that he was going to be my copilot . " Wonderful , " I told him . " flow many hours do you have on one of these Pavijan class transports ? " He admitted to an unhappily low figure and I patted him on the shoulder . " You are in luck . Unlike most First Pilots your old Uncle Vaska is without ego . For an old drinking buddy no sacrifice is too great . I am going to let you fire the takeoff and if you do the kind of job I think you will do , then I might let you shoot the landing as well . Now hand me the check list . " His gratitude was overwhelming , so nuu h so that he admitted that he had been saving his fountain pen for a real emergency since it was filled with zoo proof alcohol and we both had it squirt . It was with a feeling of contentment  --  and scarred throats  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loading ports far below . A few minutes later a grizzled fullbearded colonel in combat uniform stamped into the navroom . " No passengers allowed here , " I said . " Shut your mouth , lieutenant . I have your course tapes . " " Well let me have them ? " " What ? You must be either mad or joking  --  and both are shooting offenses in combat . " " I must be on edge , colonel , not much sleep , you know ... " " Yes . " He relented slightly . " Allowances must be made , I suppose . It has n't been easy for anyone . But that 's behind us now . Victory for Cliaand ! " " Victory for Cliaand ! " we entolled ritually . There had been a lot of this the last couple of days . The Colonel looked at his watch . " Almost time . Get the command circuit , " he ordered . I pointed to Otrov , who pressed the right button instantly . A message appeared on the comscreen . STAND BY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed to the harsh letters , sET COURSE . The colonel took the tape container from his pouch and we  | had to sign as witnesses on a form stating that the tape was sealed when we received it . Otrov inserted the tape into the computer and the colonel grunted in satisfaction , his work done , and turned to leave . He fired a parting shot over his shoulder on the way out . " And none of those io G landings that you moronic pilots seem to enjoy . I 'll coif rtmartial you both if that happens . " " Your mother knits sweaters out of garbage , " I shouted after him , waiting , of course , until the door was closed . But even this feeble effort stirred enthusiasm in Otrov who was beginning to respect me more and more . 1 furry up and wait is common to all military forces and that is what we did next . The check lists were complete and we saw ship after ship take off until most were gone . The transports were last . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our way . To a nameless planet circling an unknown star as far as any of us were concerned . The tape told the computer where we were going but did not condescend , nor had it been programmed , to inform us . This security blanket lasted right up to the invasion itself . We were seven boring days en route with nothing to drink and the ship piloted by the computer and the frozen rations barely edible . On a long term basis , without the ameliorating effects of alcohol , Otrov proved to be less than a sparkling companion . No matter where the conversation began it invariably ended up in repetitive anecdotes from his school days . I slept well , I 'll say that , and usually while he was talking but he never seemed to mind . I also checked him out on the instruments with drills and dry runs , which may have done him some active good and certainly acquainted me with the controls and operation of the ship . Since the ship was completely automated , Otrov and I were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troop area was sealed and my friend the surly colonel had the only key . He visited us once or twice which was no pleasure at all . On the seventh day he was standing behind us glowering at the back of my neck when we broke out of warpdrive and back into normal space . " Take this , inspect here , sign that , " he snapped and we did all those things before he broke the seal on the flat case . This was labeled INVASION in large red letters which rather suggested that things would be hotting up soon . My instructions were simple enough and I switched on the circuits as ordered so the ship could  | home on the squadron leader . A yellowish sun shone brightly off to one side and the blue sphere of a planet was on the other . The colonel glared at this planet as though he wanted to reach out and grab it and take a bite out of it , so future developments seemed obvious enough without asking questions . The invasion began . Most of the fleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space and visible only occasionally as a network of sparks when they changed course . Our squadron of transports stayed together , automatically following the course set by the lead ship , and the planet grew in the screens ahead . It looked peaceful enough from this distance , though I knew the advance units of the fleet must be attacking by this time . I was not looking forward to this invasion  --  who but a madman can enjoy the prospect of approaching , war 's ' ? hut I was hoping to find out the answer to the question that had brought me here . I believed that interplanetary invasions weir sill impossible , despite the fact that I was now involved in one myself I felt somewhat like the man who , upon seeing one of the most eotw animals in the zoo , said there ai n't no such animal . ' Interplanetary invasions just do n't work . The interplanetary invading force rushed on , a mighty armada giving the lie to my theories . As the nameless planet grew larger and larger , filling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war that I knew was already in progress ; tiny sparkles of light in the night hemisphere . Otrov saw them too and waved his fist and cheered . " Give it to them , boys , " he shouted . " Shut up and watch your instruments , " I snarled . Suddenly hating him . And instantly relenting . He was a product of his environment . As the twig is bent so grows the bough and so forth . His twig had been bent nicely by the military boarding school into which he had been stuffed as a small child . Which , for some unknown reason , he still thought well of although every story he told me about it had some depressing or sadistic point to make . He had been raised never to question , to believe God had created Cliaand a bit better than all the other planets , and that they were therefore ordained to take care of the inferior races . It is amazing the things people will believe if you catch them early enough . Then we were turned loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their separate targets . I fiddled with the radio and silently cursed the Cliaandian passion for security and secrecy . Here I was landing a shipload of troops  --  and I did n't even know where ! On the planet below , surely , they could not very well disguise that fact , but on what continent ? At what city ? All I knew was that pathfinder ships had gone in first and planted radio beacons . I had the frequency and the signal I was to listen for , and when I detected it I was to home in and land . And I knew that the target was a spaceport . With the final instructions I had received sonic large and clear photographs  --  the Cliaandian spies had obviously been hard at work  --  of a spaceport ; aerial and ground views . A big red X was marked near the terminal buildings and I had to set the ship down as close to this site as I could . Fine . " That 's the signal ! " The dah-dah-dit-dah was loud and clear . " Strap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fed instructions to the computer . It worked up landing orbit almost instantly and the main jets fired . " Give the colonel the first warning , then feed him proximity and altitude reports while I bring her in . " We were dropping towards the terminator , flying into the dawn . The computer had a fix on the transmitter and was bringing us down in a slow careful arc . When we broke through the cloud cover and the ground was visible far below I saw the first sign of any resistance . The black clouds of explosions springing up around us . " They 're shooting at us ! " Otrov gasped , shocked . " Well it 's a shooting war , is n't it ? " I wondered what kind of a veteran he was to be put off by a little gunfire , and at the same time I hit the computer override and turned off the main jets . We dropped into free fall and the next explosions appeared above and behind us as the gun computer was thrown off by our deceleration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the lateral jets to move us in that direction . But we were still falling . Our radar altimeter readings were being fed into the computer which kept flashing red warnings about the growing proximity of the ground . I gave it a quick program to hold landing deceleration as long as possible , to drop us at 10 G 's to zero altitude . This meant we would be falling at maximum speed and slowing down for minimum time , which would decrease the time we would be exposed to ground  | fire . And I wanted the colonel to have the io G 's he had once warned me about . The jets fired at what looked like treetop height , slamming us down into our couches . I smiled , which is hard to do with ten gravities pulling at you , thinking about the expression on the colonel 's face at that moment . Watching the screen I added some lateral drift until we were just over the hardstand which was our target area . After this it was up to the computer which did just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crunched down . As soon as all the engines cut off 1 hit the disembark button and the ship shivered as the ramps blew out and down . " That takes care of our part , " I said , unbuckling and stretching . Otrov joined me at the viewport as we watched the troops rush down the ramps and run for cover . They did not seem to be taking any casualties at all which was sotprisitig . ' I bere were some bomb craters visible nearby and heaps of riihl , le , Bile fighter-bombers still roared low giving cover . But it did n't seem possible that all resistance had been knocked out this quickly . Unless this world did not have much of a standing army . That might be one answer to explain the Cliaandian invasion success ; only pick planets that are ripe for plucking . I made a mental note to look into this . Well behind his troops came the colonel in his command car . I hoped that his guts were still compressed from the landing . " Now we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips with anticipation . " I 'll go , " I said , taking my sidearm from the rack and buckling it on . " You stay with the radio and watch the ship . " " That 's what all the first pilots always say , " he complained , so I knew I had called this one right . " Privilege of rank . Someday you will be exercising it too . I should n't be long . " " Spaceport bar , that 's where it usually is , " he called after me . " Do n't teach your grandpa to chew cheese , " I sneered , having already figured that one out . All of the interior doors had unlocked automatically when we landed . I climbed the ladders down to the recently vacated combat deck and kicked my way through the discarded ration containers to the nearest ramp . The fresh sweet air of morning blew in , carry-  | ing with it the smell of dust and explosives . We had brought the benefits of Cliaandian culture to another planet . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was gone , but after this it was very quiet . The invasion had fanned out from the spaceport leaving a pocket of silence in its wake . Nor was anyone in sight when I walked , unexamined , through the customs area and , with reflex skill , found the bar . The first thing I did was to drain a flask of beer , then poured a small Antarean ladevandet to hold it down . There were ranked bottles behind the bar , new friends and old ones , and I made a good selection . I needed something to carry them in and opened one of the sliding doors beneath , looking for a box or a bag , and found myself staring into the frightened eyes of a young man . " Ne mortigu min ! " he cried . I speak Esperanto like a native and answered in the same tongue . " We are here to liberate you so mean you no harm . " Word of this conversation might get to the authorities and I wanted to make the right impression . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And the name of this world ? " This seemed sort of a dim question for an arrogant invader to ask , but he was too frightened to question it . " Burada . " " That 's fine , I 'm glad you decided to be truthful . And what can you tell me about Burada ? " Badly phrased , admittedly , and he was too stunned to answer . He gaped for a moment , then climbed out of the cabinet and turned to root about in it . He came up with a booklet that he passed over in silence . It had a 3D cover of an ocean with graceful trees on the bordering shore , that sprang to life as soon as the heat of my hand touched it ; the waves crashed silently on the golden sands and the trees moved to the touch of unfelt breezes . Letters formed of clouds moved across the sky and I read BEAUTIFUL BURADA . . . HOLIDAY WORLD OF THE WESTERN WARP . . . " Looting and consorting with the enemy , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I turned slowly to see my friend the colonel from our ship standing there fingering his gaussrifle with what can only be termed a filthy grin on his face . " And lo G landing too , " he added , undoubtedly the real cause of  | his unhappiness . " Which is not a shooting offense although the other two are . " PIRE SHRIEKED IN A MUFFLED MANNER and drew back , not understanding the colonel 's words but recognizing his manner and his weapon . I smiled , as coldly as I could , as I saw that my hands were out of sight below the bar . Turning to the youth I pointed to the far end of the room and ordered hint t1lele . Ile scuttled nicely and while this bit of mis-direction was going on I slipped the tourist book into my pocket and eased my gausspistol out of its holster . When I turned back to the colonel I saw that he had half raised his rifle . " You are wrong , " I said , " and insulting as well to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am aiding our invading forces by securing this drinking establishment to prevent any of your troops from becoming drunk on duty and therefore injuring our all-out efforts . And while in this place I took a prisoner who was hiding here . That is what happened and it is my word against yours , colonel . " He raised his gun barrel towards me and said , " It is only my word that I caught you looting and was forced to shoot you when you resisted arrest . " " I am a hard one to shoot , " I said , letting the muzzle of my pistol slide up over the edge of the bar until it was centered between his eyes . " I am an expert shot and one of these explosive slugs will take the top of your head off . " Apparently he had not expected this kind of instant response from a flying officer and he hesitated for a moment . Fire squealed faintly and there was a thud . I assumed he had fainted but was too busy to look . This murderous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of knowing how it might have ended if a soldier had not rushed into view with a field radio . The colonel took the phone
