When the 92nd Congress convened last January , the Nixon Administration sought and got the designation of H.R.I-the number given the first bill introduced in the House of Representatives - for the proposed Family Assistance Plan to reform the welfare system . In the months that followed , as taxpayer resentment of the existing system grew because of ever-mounting welfare costs , H.R.I wound up in legislative limbo , sacrificed to the Administration 's new economic policies and old congressional rivalries . But the welfare issue has lost none of its emotional power . Before it adjourned last week , Congress acted : not on H.R.I , but on an obscure Social Security bill ; not to pass effective reform , only to make a largely symbolic gesture . The result could well complicate chances for passage of Nixon 's far-reaching welfare-reorganization program . <P> The welfare measure passed last week came in the form of amendments to a bill covering Social Security survivors ' benefits . Sponsored by Georgia Senator Herman Talmadge , the amendments say that some recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children funds must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " workfare " has long been dear to critics anxious to cut welfare chiselers from the relief rolls . It was a prime component of Nixon 's reform package . The Talmadge amendments slightly beef up existing regulations requiring job registration for welfare recipients , but in fact they are not so stringent as some provisions of H.R.I. For example , mothers with children under the age of six would be exempt under the Talmadge plan ; the Nixon proposals exempt mothers whose children are three or under . Included in earlier Talmadge amendments to a tax bill was an incentive plan for businesses to hire welfare trainees ; last week 's amendments provide a new funding formula for on-the-job training . The new law will take 18 months to set up and , at that , is expected to increase the number of recipients registered for workfare by no more than 30,000 . <P> Drawing Card . Oddly enough , the chief reservations expressed in Congress came not from Democratic welfare reformers , but from Republicans . Liberals considered the bill such a paper tiger that they did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups . Nixon supporters feared that the bill would worsen the odds for passage of H.R. 1 . John Byrnes , ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee , voted for the bill but lamented that the Talmadge package " contains the stick , but not the carrot . " With workfare pre-empted by the Talmadge legislation , the Administration loses its most powerful drawing card for conservative support of family assistance . <P> Nonetheless , the new bill gave Congressmen the opportunity to point to tangible legislation on welfare before going home to their constituents for the holidays . Unquestionably , a welfare backlash has built across the country during the past year that makes even symbolic legislation important . Some examples : <P> &gt; Trying to reduce a projected welfare budget deficit of $107 million , Illinois Republican Governor Richard Ogilvie announced a cut in benefits of $71 million . Medicaid will be slashed by $50 million ; the remaining cuts will be made in general assistance .                    @
