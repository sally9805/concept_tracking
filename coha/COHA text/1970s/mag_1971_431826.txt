 | WE ARE IN a small outboard motorboat in Scammon Lagoon , on the barren , dune-rippled coast of Mexico 's Baja California . Suddenly , less than 100 feet away , an awesome creature the size of a Greyhound bus rises vertically from the slate-colored water . Its gaping mouth reveals the baleen , a comblike mass of horny plates hanging from the upper jaw . Through the baleen stream gallons of muddy water . Long ribbons of eelgrass dangle from the mouth . The spectacle is reminiscent of a prehistoric monster as portrayed by an imaginative artist . And that , in a way , is what we are seeing : a California gray whale ( Eschrichtius glaucus ) , once perilously near extinction but now protected by international agreements and staging an impressive comeback . In the few seconds before our whale slides from view , we get a good look at the long tapered head with eyes set far back near the corners of the mouth .

Using these limbs like a submarine 's diving planes , the gray whale wheels and dives and climbs through its dim , salty domain .

Breaching Whales Can Reach 30 Knots Up-and-down strokes of the great tail , measuring ten feet across the trailing edges of the fan-shaped flukes , drive the 3S-ton cetacean through the water . Grays cruise at about four knots , but can maintain a ten-knot speed for an hour or so . To shoot out of the water in the breaching maneuver , they can accelerate briefly to 30 knots ( page 401 ) .

Like some other whales in an order that numbers about a hundred species , the California gray developed the baleen filter that enables it to feed on small marine organisms . And like all whales , it has lungs and must surface to breathe . The gray does this every four to 15 minutes through twin blowholes , or nostrils , atop its head . From our boat we watch the climax of the feeding process . Having bulldozed huge furrows across the lagoon floor , the whale has engulfed power-shovel helpings of crabs , shrimps , clams , and whatever else lay in its path , including a lot of debris ( pages 408-409 ) . Its mouth full , it rears to an upright stance , sculling with its powerful tail or perhaps resting its flukes on the bottom ( page 410 ) . Then , as we look on , the whale pushes water and sediment through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as 3,000 pounds . In the vertical posture the law of gravity takes over , conveying food from the whale 's mouth to a capacious fourchambered stomach . Although a gray whale can swallow when horizontal , the vertical position allows it to clean entangled debris  | from the filter and to wash food down to the throat for quick ingestion . After a long day of whale-watching we start up the outboard motor and head back to our little expedition 's mother ship , a chartered 40-foot fishing vessel that brought us south from San Diego . En route we see dozens of other whales ? feeding , surfacing , diving with a flourish of flukes , spouting , carrying out the ritual of courtship , or sleeping partly awash in the fading sunlight . After dinner , with whales still whooshing and splashing all about in the twilight , I swap notes with NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC 's Bates Littlehales , who has been out with his cameras in another boat . He tells of an encounter with local fishermen ? wiry , mahogany-hued men who harvest anchovies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lagoon 's eelgrass pastures . " The men were muy infelices , very unhappy , " Bates reports . " They said the whales were gobbling up too many of their fish . " Although I sympathize with the fishermen , the report supports a conclusion of mine in which I am in disagreement with other cetologists , who say that gray whales do not feed in the lagoons . They refer to the whale 's brief vertical posture as " spy-hopping . " In this maneuver , they say , the whale looks around , spying out possible dangers such as ships , or even spotting shore landmarks as aids to navigation . In reply , I cite my own observations of whales feeding , the facts that in the " spy-hopping " position their range of vision is limited and that they navigate mostly by echolocation , and now the Mexican fishermen 's complaint .

Then I climb to the flying bridge for an hour or two of eavesdropping on whale " conversation . " Whales have no vocal cords , but they produce a variety of sounds that carry through the water for astonishing distances . The importance of sound to all whales was described most eloquently by marine biologist Dr. Victor B. Scheffer in his fascinating book , The Year of the Whale ( Charles Scribner 's Sons , New York , 1969 ) . " Every whale everywhere moves in a sea of total sound , " writes Dr. Scheffer . " From the moment of its birth until its Sea-hunters ' bonanza : Century-old lithograph records the slaughter of grays amid the mangrove islets of a Baja California lagoon . After harpooners kill the whales , crews tow the carcasses to ships for cutting up and rendering into oil . Flag atop the whale in foreground identifies the vessel that killed it .

The snapping and crackling of tiny shrimps and crablike organisms , the grunting and grating , puffing and booming , of a hundred fishes , the eerie whining and squealing of dolphins , the sad voices of sea birds overhead , the chatter of its own companions , the undertone of moving water and the drone of wind , all these notes and many more come flooding through its senses . . . . It feels the music , too , for water presses firmly on its frame ? a smooth continuous sounding board . " The " song " of the nearly extinct humpback whale ( Megaptera novaeangliae ) , recorded in Bermuda waters by Dr. Roger S. Payne , reminds listeners of oboe , muted cornet , and bagpipes . Entirely different , but equally impressive , is the clacking sound of the mighty sperm whale ( Physeter catodon ) , the species that included the famous Moby Dick . The sperm attains lengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it sends out a signal roughly equal in decibels to the noise heard by a man standing 20 feet directly behind a jet engine at wide-open throttle ! Monotonous Clicks Help Grays Navigate Nobody knows exactly how whales create sounds . Humpbacks may produce their signals by the passage of air from lungs through larynx , a theory that could apply to the California grays as well . After hours of listening to gray-whale sounds , I must report that the gray lacks the musical talent of the humpback and the great  | volume of the sperm whale . The gray emits a monotonous series of high-frequency clicks . The signals undoubtedly help the gray zero in on schools of fish and find its way by echolocation . As the whale swims , the clicks bounce back from moving masses of food or from obstacles such as shoals , seamounts , and submarine canyon walls , thus enabling the animal to compute distance and direction and hold to a safe course . Scientists suspect that whales , like porpoises , also use varying sounds to communicate with one another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have studied gray whales mainly in Baja California waters , but such are the creatures ' habits that I can watch them at home , too . From my garden on the heights of La Jolla , I can look out over the Pacific toward San Clemente Island , hulking blue-gray in the hazy distance . Around Christmastime I see the frequent rise and fall of wispy white jets , like a procession of old-fashioned steam locomotives . Under each plume of vapor ? caused by condensation of expelled warm air ? swims a gray whale headed south . All summer the whales had fed close to the shores of Siberia , fattening on an abundance of plankton and bottom-dwelling crustaceans . In early fall , with the onset of freezing weather , the animals felt the ancient urge to migrate and to mate . Leaving the Arctic seas behind , they found their way through the Aleutian ' Sound-sensing abilities of the smaller cetaceans were described in " Porpoises : Our Friends in the Sea , " by Robert Leslie Conly , GEOGRAPHIC , September 1966 .

After heading toward British Columbia , they made landfall near the Columbia River mouth . From there they took a southerly course , keeping close to the beaches and headlands of Oregon and California . By journey 's end the whales will have covered at least 4,000 miles ( map , page 397 ) . Some scientists believe the grays do not feed while migrating but rely on reserves of fat they have built up during the summer . I disagree . Even granting the tremendous power of these animals , it seems obvious to me that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least three and a half months . While grays are essentially bottom feeders , I believe they take food where they find it ? and on migration they find plenty of squid , crabs , and fish . The spectacle of their passage arouses in me a sense of awe combined with gratitude . Here are creatures that have survived over millions of years , only to be brought to the brink of extinction by a few decades of relentless  | slaughter by men who hunted them , first in sailing vessels and later in highly mechanized factory ships , seeking profit from a yield of oil , meat , and bone . But since 1937 , through an international conservation program , the gray whale has recouped its numbers in gratifying fashion . The 15-nation International Whaling Commission last year recommended that the total prohibition on commercial hunting of gray whales remain in effect indefinitely . And last December , the United States placed eight whale species ? including the gray on the endangered-species list and banned the import of most whale products . Only a handful of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones are several divers on the exploration team of Capt . Jacques-Yves Cousteau , well known to National Geographic Society members . Cousteau 's divers not only photographed whales at close range ( pages 394-5 and following page ) but they also hitched rides by hanging onto tail flukes . Sometimes they leaped 405  | from swift rubber motorboats to photograph the giants as they went by . One of them miscalculated and found himself sharing a speeding mother whale 's back with her newborn calf , which was held in position near the cow 's tail by the pressing flow of water . For most observers the only signs of the giants are spouts and partial glimpses of the whales themselves . Even so , the procession of migrants , in twos and threes and sometimes by the dozen , ranks as one of the greatest free shows on the West Coast . Around San Diego thousands of people gather annually to watch the southward movement ( pages 414-15 ) . In the spring the performance takes place on a less dramatic scale ; heading back to Arctic waters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 397 ) . One migration season I was on a boat near La Jolla and fell in astern of a fine big whale . My companions and I watched at unusually close range as it repeatedly surfaced , spouted , and returned to the depths with a parting flirt of its tail . Gradually we realized that the whale was on a collision course with a long pier . At the last moment the whale burst from the sea at a 45-degree angle . Then it breached again and again , each time falling back on its side and heading a few more degrees toward the open sea . By the time the whale had made ten lunges out of the sea , it was clear of the obstacle and back on course . I have observed similar performances elsewhere . And I believe that breaching enables whales to make emergency course corrections . Whale-Watching Has Its Dangers By some miracle , few whale-watchers have come to grief as they have cruised amid spouting and breaching whales .

Frantic bailing and hasty patching kept it afloat until help came. * *See " Hunting the Heartbeat of a Whale , " by Paul Dudley White , M.D. , with Samuel W. Matthews , NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC , July 1956. 7 Whale Comes Back 407 Another encounter almost cost the life of my friend Rick Grigg , then a graduate student at Scripps Institution of Oceanography . While scuba diving one day , Rick emerged from under a ledge and found himself close enough to a gray whale to touch it . Rick did just that .

Most species of whales have mighty teeth for attack or defense ; the gray 's only weapon is its tail . But a formidable weapon it is ! Whenever I see uplifted flukes at close range , I recall the words of Captain Ahab 's chief mate Starbuck in Moby Dick : " I will have no man in my boat who is not afraid of a whale . " Slaughter Prompted by Demand for Oil Today 's tight curbs on whaling stand in sharp contrast to the uncontrolled slaughter Herman Melville so vividly recorded . Even so , many of us feel that whalers of some countries still kill excessively and that the International Whaling Commission , or a similar body , should be given strong police powers . Some historians believe that the first whalers were Basques , hunting in the Bay of Biscay as early as the 10th century and in Newfoundland waters by the 16th . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whaling operations at Spitsbergen in 1610 . In North America , whaling from shore stations had become an established industry on Long Island by the middle of the 17th century . Later , the centers shifted to Boston , Cape Cod , and Connecticut . With the growing demand for whale oil and the advent of ships capable of three- to four-year voyages to southern seas , Nantucket and then New Bedford became the major whaling ports . Massachusetts whalers dominated the industry until its decline in the late 19th century , when petroleum began supplanting whale oil for lamps and candles . For a while longer there was a lively market for whalebone , actually the tough , springy , hornlike baleen . In those days our forebears wore corsets with whalebone stays , carried umbrellas with whalebone ribs , and brandished  | whalebone whips when out for a buggy ride . The West Coast also had its whaling in:ustry , and a leading center was San Franaco . Gray whales were the chief quarry ; al:hough smaller than sperm and right whales , they yielded profitable amounts of oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remarkable Capt . Charles Melville Scammon , who left his native Pittston , Maine , to seek his fortune in San Franisco . He accepted command of the brig Mary Helen in 1852 , and set out to hunt whales and elephant seals . For nine years Scammon and his harpooners slew hundreds of whales , and thousands of barrels of oil were delivered to the shipowners . His favorite whale-hunting grounds Food-straining system , the baleen consists of some 150 filter plates on each side of the animal 's mouth ( above ) . Through this curtain of hornlike plates hanging from the upper jaw , the whale 's enormous tongue pushes out water and silt , retaining the food . Shaking down her dinner , a female gray stands on her tail in 20 feet of water .

He reaped particularly rich harvests in Laguna Ojo de Liebre Eye of the Hare Lagoon . Most English-language maps and charts today show the 250-square-mile body of water as Scammon Lagoon , though Baja Californians still use the Spanish name . Scammon differed from other whalers in that he combined his hunting expertise with a keen interest in zoology and considerable writing skill . His great contribution was a book , The Marine Mammals of the Northwestern Coast of North America . Some of its zoological content has lost validity in the century since it was written , but scientists still accord Scammon the highest respect . His observations on gray-whale behavior were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to May " the cows enter the lagoons on the lower coast to bring forth their young .... The time of gestation is about one year . " Scammon also noted that the cows , as the time for parturition arrived , retired to the most remote extremities of the lagoons , which reach as far as 30 miles into the desert . My own observations , made during five winter seasons in the lagoons , reveal that some cows do indeed seek out the loneliest reaches  | where high salinity gives babies added buoyancy and abundant food enables mothers to make milk to suckle their young . Most cows , however , prefer the lagoon entrances , and some calve at sea . Scammon did not comment specifically on the mating habits of gray whales . But again , from personal observation , I believe that three whales ? a cow and two bulls ? are involved . The function of the second bull has never been fully explained ; presumably he helps stabilize the cow as she rolls on her side and presents herself to the male for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnessed the birth of a gray whale , but there is a possibility that photographer Bates Littlehales came closest to the experience . Before we left La Jolla on our Baja California expedition , Bates set out one afternoon to make aerial photographs along the migration route . After he had received his color transparencies from the processors , he telephoned me from his hotel . " I think I 've got a picture of a whale giving birth , " he said . " Come over and look at it . " The picture had been made from low altitude near the Coronados , the island group off Tijuana , and showed a cow floundering on her back . I believe she was in labor , with what seemed to be about half of a baby protruding tail-first from her abdomen . Unfortunately , the thrashing of the whale roiled the water and obscured the details . We who follow the gray whale take such frustrations in stride .

My own guess would be about 6,000 , based on the frequency of sightings and the relative abundance of whales in the lagoons during my seasons of study there . And the studies go on , so that each year we know more about these gray leviathans . But despite the efforts of scientists , whales are likely to remain ? in part , at least ? what Herman Melville called them : " portentous and mysterious .
