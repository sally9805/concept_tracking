" Justice delayed is justice denied , " runs an old legal maxim . Former Nevada Judge Clifford Jones , 59 , might be inclined to disagree . For him , it seems that the slower the law moves , the better . Having long since stepped down from the bench to serve a couple of terms as Nevada 's Lieutenant Governor , " Big Juice , " as he is known , now operates as a big-time gambler . This week , beating all the odds , he will celebrate the sixth anniversary of his indictment for perjury in the Bobby Baker payoff case . Baker , who was indicted along with Jones on Jan. 5 , 1966 , has been tried , convicted , jailed and recently denied a parole . Big Juice has so far avoided going to trial at all . No court date is even in sight . <P> According to the indictment , Big Juice Jones sent a Washington lobbyist named Wayne L. Bromley ten $1,000 checks during 1963 and 1964 to pay Bromley for representing a Las Vegas savings and loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the table to Baker , the Senate 's Democratic majority secretary . Bromley later turned informer for the Government , and agents sent him to meet Jones with a small radio transmitter strapped to his body . After listening to tapes of their conversation , a Washington grand jury concluded that " Jones was trying to teach Bromley his perjured story . " When Jones denied knowledge of the Baker payoff , he was indicted for perjury . <P> Luckily for Jones , as he now acknowledges , " I had good friends in Washington who are lawyers . " The firm of Welch &; Morgan began a systematic series of motions . Requests were made for a transcript of the grand jury testimony , for a quashing of the indictment , for the suppression of evidence obtained by electronic eavesdropping , and for a bill of particulars from the Justice Department . As each motion was denied , Jones ' lawyers appealed to higher courts . The question of admitting the portable radio evidence took four years to reach the U.S. Supreme Court , which let stand a decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a motion to move the hypothetical trial from Washington to Las Vegas . Seven such requests , each based on a different argument , have been considered and rejected by federal courts . Jones ' chief attorney , Charles McNelis , filed an eighth request for change of venue June 28 , but Federal Judge Joseph C. Waddy has not yet found time to rule on it . When Waddy decides , McNelis will be ready with more motions . Says he : " There are some other procedural matters that have n't been disposed of . " <P> The lengthening roster of delays may already have cost Jones an estimated $150,000 , and as he himself says , " If I 'd been a poor man , or even an average guy , I would n't have been able to afford it . " <P> Do n't Wait . One reason he can afford it is that despite the indictment , Jones ' worldwide gambling ventures are apparently thriving . " I 'm just now getting some deals going , " he says . He returned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overseas casinos , including one in Yugoslavia . He also continues to protest his innocence : " All my misfortunes seem to come from trying to do somebody a favor . "
