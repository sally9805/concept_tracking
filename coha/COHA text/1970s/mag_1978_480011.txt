THE MAIN CURRENT of Zionism has always nourished itself on the illusion that the Jews were " a people without a land " returning to " a land without . a people . " But there was from the beginning of the movement another Zionism , now almost forgotten , except by scholars , that was prepared , from the deepest ethical motives , to face up to the reality that Palestine was not an empty land but contained another and kindred people . They were a lonely handful then , and they are a lonelier one now , when the pendulum of power has swung to the far Right , to the ultra-nationalists , with their old leader , Menachem Begin , in office . Perhaps never more than now has this Other Zionism seemed more like a voice in the political wilderness , but the time may be coming when more and more Israelis and Jews will wish these voices had been heard , and when their message will take on renewed life and meaning if there is to be peace and Israel is to survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievement was in establishing the Hebrew University in Jerusalem in 1925 . He served as its president until his death in 1948 . Ahad Ha Am , a Russian Jewish intellectual , played a role in obtaining the Balfour Declaration , by which the British government pledged itself in 1917 to establish in Palestine " a national home for the Jewish people . " Ahad Ha Am was also one of the few in the Zionist movement who stressed the parallel obligation expressed in the Declaration " that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine . " Ahad Ha Am called himself a " cultural Zionist . " He wanted the political aims of Zionism limited , as his biography in the Encyclopaedia Judaica expresses it , by " consideration for the national rights of the Palestinian Arabs . " This was a mite rarely if ever struck by the spokesmen for main-line Zionism . These regarded the pledge to the Palestinian Arabs as a kind of British imperialist trick and insisted on reading the Balfour Declaration as a promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn all Palestine into a Jewish state . Four years after the Balfour Declaration was promulgated , Ahad Ha Am expanded his views on it in a preface to the Berlin edition of his book At the Cross Ways . He wrote then that the historical right of the Jewish people to a national home in Palestine " does not invalidate the right of the rest of the land 's inhabitants . " He recognized that they have " a genuine right to the land due to generations of residence and work upon it . " For them " too , " Ahad Ha Am went on , " this country is a national home and they have the right to develop their national potentialities to the uttermost . " He felt that this " makes Palestine into a common possession of different peoples .

But his younger American disciple , Magnes , followed in his footsteps . He made a lifelong effort to bring Arabs and Jews together , and to work for a binational state in which the national rights and aspirations of both peoples would be safeguarded by fundamental constitutional guarantees . In such a state the constitution , regardless of which was at any time in the majority , would recognize two nations within the one state , with full rights to cultural autonomy , fostered by two official languages , Arabic and Hebrew . The considerations that led Magnes all his life to espouse this view were movingly set forth in his address opening the Hebrew University in Jerusalem for its 1929-30 academic year . This old address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South Lebanese invasion and the use by the Israeli army of cluster bombs against the civilian population . " One of the greatest cultural duties of the Jewish people , " Magnes said then , " is the attempt to enter the Promised Land , not by means of conquest as Joshua , but through peaceful and cultural means , through hard work , sacrifice , love , and with a decision not to do anything which can not be justified before the world conscience . " Nationalist and universalist T HERE WAS MUCH in the same spirit in the writings and example of an earlier pioneer , A. D. Gordon , who died in 1922 , the year Magnes first settled in Palestine . Gordon was a Tolstoyan Zionist who left his family in Russia in 1904 to live in * From an English translation by Judah L. Mag . nes in his own book , Like All the Nations ? , pub . fished in Jerusalem in 1930 . Palestine . He believed that the Jews could reestablish a nation in Palestine only if they began to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was already forty-eight years of age when he emigrated , and a writer and philosopher hitherto unused to physical labor , he set out to live as he believed . " He worked , " says his biography in the Encyclopaedia Judaica , " as a manual laborer in the vineyards and orange groves of Petah Tikvah and Rishon le-Zion " ? two of the oldest Jewish farming settlements in Palestine ? " and , after 1912 , in various villages in Galilee , suffering all the tribulations of the pioneers : malaria , unemployment , hunger , and insecurity . " He lies buried near the villages among which he worked , and I remember , on my first visit to Palestine in 1945 , standing beside his grave under the willows in the rustic peace of the little cemetery outside Degania , where the Jordan reemerges from the Sea of Galilee . Gordon is perhaps the single most inspiring figure among all the early pioneers , and the younger people beside whom he worked felt his saintly quality . Gordon was a secular mystic , a nationalist who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the mission of the nation he helped to resurrect . " We were the first to proclaim , " Gordon wrote of the Jews , " that man is created in the image of God . We must go further and say : the nation must he created in the image of God . Not because we are better than others , but because we have borne upon our shoulders and suffered all which calls for this . It is by paying the price of torments the like of which the world has never known " ? the Holocaust was still beyond even his vision ? " that we have won the right to be the first in this work of creation . " In Gordon 's opinion the test , the crucial test , of the Jews would be their attitude toward the Arabs . " Our attitude toward them , " he wrote , " must be one of humanity , of moral courage which remains on the highest plane , even if the behavior of the other side is not all that is desired . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more reason for our humanity . " ? Gordon 's approach was rather singular . In an age of socialism , nationalism , and skepticism , his first consideration was the redemption of the individual . He once wrote . " Our road leads to nature through the medium of physical labor . " Hence his has been called " the religion of labor . " He felt , as a biographer put it , that " God can not be known , but he can be experienced and lived . " He felt that the transformation of society must begin with the transformation of the individual , and he rejected utilitarianism and Marxism . For Gordon , though a nationalist , the nation was " the intermediary between the individual and humanity as a whole . " In his view , " each and every nation must see itself as a unit responsible for the fate of humanity and for the attainment of universal justice . " From this it followed that " the relationship between the Jews and the Arabs in Palestine was important because if the Jews were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be done on the basis of injustice . " The Jews , in his view , had a right to return " to Palestine and become once again a part of it , but the Arabs were part of it , too . " * Gordon believed , as his biographer in the Encyclopaedia litdaica expresses it , that " a people incarnates * Gordon as summarized by Susan Lee Hattis in her doctoral thesis at the University of Geneva , The 81-National Idea in Palestine During Mandatory Times ( Shikmona Publishing Company , Jerusalem , 1970 ) . humanity only to the extent to which it obeys the moral law . " In this , Gordon saw eye to eye with the Prophets and with Ahad Ha Am . For Gordon , the Arab problem was central . He recognized that the Arabs were " a living nation . though not a free one " I he was writing in 1919 , remember ) , and that like it or not they would be " partners with us in the political and social life " of the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because " here we have the first lesson and the first practical exercise in the life of brotherhood between nations . " He saw this as an essential test " in every one of us , " that is , the Jews , " individually , " and concluded that " if we shall aim at being more human , more alive , we will find the correct relationships to man and the nations in general and to the Arabs in particular . " The test of Jewish humanity was to be in the Jewish attitude toward the Arabs . Nor did Gordon see this relationship purely in terms of mystic vision . He translated it into terms of the land question , fearing the coming dispossession of the Arab peasant . In 1922 , when drafting statutes for the guidance of Zionist labor settlements , he included a provision long forgotten : Wherever settlements are founded , a specific share of the land must be assigned to the Arabs from the outset . The distribution of sites should be equitable so that not only the welfare of the Jewish settler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The settlement has the moral obligation to assist the Arabs in any way it can . This is the only proper and fruitful way to establish good neighborly relations with the Arabs. * This may have seemed quixotic at the time and soon became a dead letter , but it held the key to fraternity and peace . The search for friendship A SIMILAR MESSAGE came from a very different sector of European Jewry , from the German Jewish philosopher Martin Buber . He too was influenced by Ahad Ha Am . He became a Zionist as early as 1898 , but for him Zionism was to be different from all other nationalisms . It was to be Der Heilige Weg , the Holy Way . This was the title of a book he published in 1919 in his native Germany . In it he espoused a " Hebrew humanism . " ** He , too , saw relations with the Arabs as crucial .

He wanted the Congress officially to proclaim " its desire to live in peace and brotherhood with the Arab people and to develop the common homeland into a republic in which both peoples will have the possibility of free development . " After Hitler came to power in 1933 , Buber stayed on in Germany for five terrifying years , as long as he could help maintain the morale of his fellow Jews . When the new regime closed the doors of German universities to " non-Aryans , " Buber helped to organize and became the head of a communal organization to *Translated from the Hebrew by Hattis , op. cit. , from the Collected Works of Aharon David Gordon ( Zionist Publications , Jerusalem , 1952-54 ) . **Quoted from Studies in Nationalism , Judaism and Universalism , edited by Raphael Loewe ( Rout-ledge &; Kegan Paul , London , 1966 ) . provide higher education for German Jewish youth .

In 1935 , when the regime forbade him to speak at Jewish gatherings , he found a way to evade that order through the Quakers . The German Friends invited him to speak at their meetings , which were open to all , including Jews . This , too , was soon forbidden . In 1938 Buber emigrated to Palestine . There I once had the privilege of speaking with him after the war . He had the aura of a Hebrew prophet . In Palestine Buber made the search for Arab-Jewish friendship one of his main concerns . Even after the outbreak of the first Arab-Jewish war in 1948 , Bober " called for a harnessing of nationalistic impulses and a solution based on compromise between the two peoples . " He was a close friend of Magnes and taught at the Hebrew University until his death in 1965 . His lovely German style makes his works among the treasures of German literature , and lie belongs to the Other Germany as well as to the Other Zionism . One of the earliest figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The son of a tenant farmer living near Kiev in Russia , Smilansky emigrated to Palestine in 1890 . He was active as a farmer , writer , and Zionist . He , too , was among the binationalists . He opposed the movement to restrict employment in Jewish colonies and fields to Jewish labor . He had the distinction of being the first modern Hebrew writer to write about the Arabs among whom he settled . Under the pen name of Ilawaja Mussa , he published amiable short stories about Arab life before World War I. These stories , " the first of their kind in Jewish literature , " says the Encyclopaedia Judaica , reveal " to the Jewish reader a new world ? exotic , colorful , throbbing with its own rich humanity . " Israel Agricultural School , the first of its kind in Palestine . Many of the earliest and most famous pre ? World War I settlements in Galilee owe much to Kalwariski for their foundation and survival . To protect these colonies , Kalwariski helped to organize the legendary Ha-Shomer , the Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the underground self-defense force of the Jewish community , ultimately developed . He also pioneered in the search for better relations with their Arab neighbors . He persuaded the Baron Edmond de Rothschild to establish a Hebrew-Arab school , the first of its kind , for the children of the Arab village of Ja'uni near the Jewish village of Rosh Pina in Galilee . Kalwariski played a part in a whole series of attempts to establish amicable relations between the rising forces of Arab and Jewish nationalism . As early as 1912 he arranged meetings in Damascus and Beirut between the famous Zionist leader Nahum Sokolow and Arab nationalists . After World War 1 , King Feisal 1 , who had led the Arab revolt against the Turks , paid Kalwariski an unusual tribute . Kalwariski was invited by the newly crowned king in Damascus and the presidium of the All-Syrian Congress " to suggest proposals for the regulation of Jewish-Arab relations in Palestine . " In 1922 Kalwariski participated in Arab-Jewish negotiations in Cairo , which were discontinued " because of the opposition of the British government . " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a secret meeting in Cairo after World War IL at which the Egyptians hoped to mediate the Arab-Jewish conflict in Palestine . Bevin aborted the meetings by threatening to make it public and so embarrass the Arab participants . ) In those years Kalwariski was not acting merely as an unauthorized Zionist heretic . He was one of the three Jewish members of the Arab-Jewish Advisory Council set up for Palestine by the first British High Commissioner , Sir Herbert Samuel , under the post ? World War I British mandatory government of Pals estine established by the League of Nations . Kalwariski also served on the executive of the Va'ad or National Council , which was a kind of unofficial governing body of the Palestinian Jewish community between the two world wars . From 1923 to 1927 he directed the Office of Arab Affairs of the Zionist Executive . In 1929 , after the Arab uprising in that year , he was appointed head of the combined office set up by the Jewish Agency and the Va'ad Le'umi to deal with Arab-Jewish tensions . Kalwariski did not limit his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading figure in a series of maverick organizations established in the Twenties , Thirties , and Forties to bring about Arab-Jewish reconciliation . These all , in one form or another , advocated a binational state . " Though these were all politically marginal movements , with little impact on majority opinion , they attracted many of the best minds and most illustrious intellectuals of the Jewish community . The earliest was the Berit Shalom ( Covenant of Peace ) . It was formed in 1925 by such leading pioneers and intellectuals as Arthur Ruppin , Hans Kohn , Gershom Scholem ? an outstanding authority on Jewish mysticism and Kalwa-riski . This was the first organization to call for the establishment of a binational state in Palestine and it was bitterly attacked by most of the Zionist parties , especially by the right-wing Revisionist Zionist party to which Prime Minister Begin belongs . Berit Shalom was attacked as " defeatist , " but the attacks , as is usual in controversy , evaded the point : Berit Shalom had no ideology ; bination-alism , they said , is not the ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasped Zionism will fail . They were not defeat-ists who were ready to make any conces-sion for the achievement of peace , they simply realized that the Arabs were jus-tified in fearing a Zionism which spoke in terms of a Jewish majority and a Jewish state . Their belief was that one need not be a maximalist , i.e. , demand mass immi-gration and a state , to be a faithful Zionist . ... What was vital was a recognition that both nations were in Palestine as of right. ** The Berit Shalom lasted until the early Thirties . It was succeeded by three similar organizations : Kedma Mizrachi ( Forward to the East ) in the Thirties ; the League of Arab-Jewish Rapprochement , established in 1939 ; and then , in 1942 , by the last and most important binationalist group , Thud , which means Unity in Hebrew , and here denotes unity with the Arabs . Kalwariski played a leading role in all these organizations . T HESE JEWISH BINATIONALIST groups , as their Zionist adversaries derisively pointed out , rarely if ever attracted Arab support . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to acknowledge my debt to Ms. Hattis and to recommend her book , already cited , for those who wish a fuller understanding of the binational movement . The hook is the only one of its kind and it is written with a sympathetic and compassionate objectivity . ** Hattis , op. cit. through in 1946 . It came in Haifa , one of the three major cities of Palestine . The scene was significant . It could not have come in Jerusalem , where Arabs and Jews lived apart , or in Tel Aviv , which was all Jewish . But in Haifa the two communities had over the years achieved a binational form of government that was a miniature of what a binational Palestine could have been . The two peoples rotated the municipal offices between them . When the mayor was an Arab , the vice-mayor was a Jew , and vice versa . There in 1946 a leading Arab intellectual declared himself for a binational Palestine . This maverick , Fauzi Darwish el-Husseini , was a member of the most influential Arab clan in Palestine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mufti of Jerusalem , Hajj Amin el-Husseini , the bitterest opponent of Zionism in his time . The Mufti went over to the Axis in World War 11 . But his cousin , at a public meeting in Haifa in 1946 , expressed his readiness for Arab-Jewish cooperation . He said the obstacles were great but that there was a way . He called for an Arab-Jewish agreement , under the auspices of the United Nations , for a " binational independent Palestine , " which would in turn link itself by " an alliance with the Arab neighboring countries . " ' Fauzi amplified his views in a talk before an Arab-Jewish gathering in the home of Kalwariski a few days later . Fauzi said he had taken part in the Arab uprising of 1929 as a follower of his cousin , the Mufti , but had begun to realize " that this road has no purpose . Experience has proven , " Fauzi went on , " that the official policy of both sides brings only damage and suffering to both . " He said that in Palestine " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and added that " there are Jews and Arabs from the older generation who nursed from the same mother . " He said : " The imperialist policy plays with us both , with the Arabs and the Jews , and there is no other way except unity and working hand in hand . " Fauzi el-Husseini stressed that the moderates must organize . " A club must be set up immediately in Jerusalem to acquire friends , to begin producing a written organ , to visit other cities for propaganda and making ties . " An Arab organization was formed called the Falastin al-Jedida ( the New Palestine 1 , and on November 11 , 1946 , five of its leading members signed an agreement with the League for Jewish-Arab Rapprochement and Cooperation . * From the text as printed July 25 , 1946 , in the Hebrew daily Al Ha Mishmar , organ of the then hinationalist Hashomer Hatzair wing of the Zionist movement , translated in Hattis , op. cit . The two sides agreed to " full cooperation between the two nations in all fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Palestine as a means to obtaining the independence of the country ... and the joining of the shared and independent Palestine in an alliance with the neighboring countries in the future . " They even reached agreement on the thorniest problem of all ? Jewish immigration . This was to be regulated " according to the absorptive capacity of the country . " ** But this at first promising beginning was brought to an end twelve days later when Fauzi Darwish el-Husseini was murdered by unknown Arab nationalists . Never before ( or since ) had a Palestinian Arab leader dared openly to negotiate with the Jews and sign an agreement with them . Another cousin , Jamal Husseini , a leader of the Arab anti-Zionists , was quoted in the Egyptian paper Akbar al Yom as saying a few days after Fauzi 's death , " My cousin stumbled and has received his proper punishment . " According to one informed source , all other Arabs who had joined with him " were murdered by Arab extremists , one after the other . " t How much agony could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab-Jewish wars would have been prevented . Who knows how many more will be fought before both sides see the inescapable choice between coexistence and mutual extinction ? A question of balance 1 OOKING BACKWARD , the basic problem between the two nationalisms was so acute that it would have been J miraculous if the moderates had won out and resolved the issue peacefully . The basic question was Jewish immigration , which grew so rapidly after the rise of Hitler to power in 1933 that the Arabs feared ? quite rightly , as it turned out ? that they might soon be swamped and become a minority in what they regarded as their own land . They protested that they were being asked to pay the price for persecution of the Jews in Nazi Germany **This and the preceding quotation were taken by Hattis from Aharon Cohen 's Israel and the Arab World , Sifriyat Poalim , Israel ? the publishing house of the Kibbutz Haartzi section of the Zionist movement , which was hinationalist until 1948. t Quoted in Norman Bentwich 's article on Ihud in the Encyclopaedia of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General of the British mandatory government of Palestine , and sympathetic to the binationalists . But his statement that Fauzi and his group were actually members of Ihud is not confirmed in Ms. Hattis 's book . The legacy of the Other Zionism T HE MAJORITY ELEMENTS in Zionism finally adopted the Jewish-state demand of the right-wing revisionists in December , 1942 , at the Biltmore Con-ference in New York . Even then , as the article on the Biltmore Program in the Encyclopaedia of Zionism and Israel explains , " Non-Zionist groups such as the American Jewish Committee regarded the Biltmore Program as a victory for the ' extreme ' Zionist position , since it called for an independent Jewish Palestine rather than the mere lifting of barriers to future Jewish immigration . " But only a Jewish state would allow unlimited immigration of Jews : this was the dilemma . At the time the ' Biltmore Program was adopted , the Holocaust was still a well-kept secret . The first leak to the outside world , according to Raul Hilherg 's monumental and heartbreaking account , The Destruction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomat on the Warsaw-Berlin express from a talkative Nazi official in the summer of 1942 . But his report was kept secret by his own government . The full dimensions of the catastrophe were not " even imagined , " Ms. Hattis writes of the Biltmore Conference , " and most Zionists were thinking and speaking in terms of millions of Jewish refugees after the war . " . Even so , resistance to a Jewish state was still a powerful undercurrent in the movement . The vote at the Biltmore was 21 to 4 for the new program . The four negative votes were cast by Hashomer Hatzair , the Marxist Zionists , who called instead for a binationalist Palestine . They argued that the alternative to binationalism would be partition , and partition would mean war with the Arabs .... Events soon proved they were right . Four months before the Biltmore Conference , a group of Zionist dissidents , among them two American Jews , Judah Magnes and Henrietta Szold , founded thud ( Unity ) , an organization whose purpose was to establish friendly contact with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testified for Thud in 1947 before the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine in favor of a binational state . After the United Nations had voted for the partition of Palestine between an Arab and a Jewish state , with economic and other links between them , Magnes pressed for the establishment of a Semitic Confederation , including Israel , as a means of preventing the war he saw would result . Again , he was unsuccessful . With the 1948 war and the establishment of a Jewish state , the binational movement came to an end , but not the Other Zionism , which continued to struggle for justice to the Arabs in Israel , as later in the occupied territories , and for Arab-Jewish reconciliation . Of the Other Zionist pioneers , Smilansky lived to make a last passionate cry for justice to the Arabs shortly before he died in 1953 . The occasion was the passage by the Knesset of the Land Requisition Law of 1953 , which legalized the expropriation of Arab lands . He wrote : When we came back to our country after having been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and we rightly complained before the whole world that the gates of the country were shut . And now when they Arab refugees dared to return to their country where they lived for 1,000 years before they were evicted or fled , they are called " infiltrees " and shot in cold blood . Where are you , Jews ? Why do we not at least , with a generous hand , pay compensation to these miserable people ? ... And do we sin only against the refugees ? Do we not treat the Arabs who remain with us as second-class citizens ? ... Did a single Jewish farmer raise his hand in the parliament in opposition to a law that deprived Arab peasants of their land ? ... How does it sit solitary , in the city of Jerusalem , the Jewish conscience ? Yet the center of moral gravity in the Zionist movement has moved steadily rightward . It is hard to find any trace of that prophetic ethic and that compassion in Prime Minister Begin . He symbolizes what Hans Kohn , another of the early binationalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral " ' double-bookkeeping ' that is so widely accepted in modern nationalism everywhere ? a twofold scale of moral judgment , defining the same action as right for oneself but wrong in the neighbor . " N OTHING COULD POINT UP MORE the contrast between the Smilansky view and Begin 's than a footnote Begin appended to his story of the Deir Yassin massacre in his book The Revolt : Story of the Irgun . Begin defends the way the Irgun wiped out the Arab village of Deir Yassin near Jerusalem in the 1948 war as a military necessity . He even claims that the Irgun sacrificed the element of surprise to warn the villagers the attack was coming . But in a footnote he notes with undisguised satisfaction that the " wild tales of Irgun butchery " that resulted were so terrifying that Arabs throughout Palestine " were seized with limitless panic and started to flee for their lives . This mass flight soon turned into a mad , uncontrollable stampede . Of the about 800,000 Arabs who lived on the present territory of the state of Israel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and economic significance of this development can hardly be overestimated . " Neither can Begin 's cold-blooded nationalistic calculation . There is no greater , more fundamental , and longstanding threat to Israel 's survival than such an attitude toward the Arabs among whom the Israelis must find a way to live . Despite the changes wrought by thirty years of development and four wars , it is remarkable how little the situation has altered since the days when the Other Zionism was still pleading for a binationalist solution . The choice is still : Either a life in common or a partitioned Palestine . Nothing could more dramatically demonstrate that the same old choice is inescapable than Begin 's conduct in office . Though the government he heads controls all of Palestine west of the Jordan , he will not declare the occupied territories part of Israel , lest he thereby transform the present Jewish state into an Arab-Jewish state in which the Arabs might be , or soon become , the majority . Begin is equally unwilling to accept the only just alternative and allow the Palestinians to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Arabs fear that he plans instead to encroach on the land left them by expanding Jewish settlements and gradually forcing more Arabs to emigrate . No matter what the choice , the two peoples must live together , either in the same Palestinian state or side by side in two Palestinian states . But either solution requires a revival of the Other Zionism , a recognition that two peoples ? not one ? occupy the same land and have the same rights . This is the path to reconciliation , and reconciliation alone can guarantee Israel 's survival . Israel can exhaust itself in new wars . It can commit suicide . It can pull . down the pillars on itself and its neighbors . But it can live only by reviving that spirit of fraternity and justice and conciliation that the Prophets preached , and the Other Zionism sought to apply . To go back and study the Other Zionism is for dissidents like myself to draw comfort in loneliness , to discover fresh sources of moral strength , and to find the secret of Israel 's survival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
