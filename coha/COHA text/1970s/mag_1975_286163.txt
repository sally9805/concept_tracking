In Washington last week , General Motors unveiled the U.S. auto industry 's newest challenge to fast-selling imports . GM 's new minicar : the Chevette , a stripped-down , two-door hatchback driven by a four-cylinder engine and sticker-priced at $2,899 ( a model with a back seat costs $3,098 ) . According to GM , soon-to-be-released Environmental Protection Agency figures will show that the Chevette gets 28 to 30 miles per gallon in city driving and 39 to 40 m.p.g. on the highway . <P> GM clearly chose Washington for the unveiling to impress Government policymakers . They have doubted that Detroit could respond quickly to public clamor for low-cost transportation , but the Chevette was rushed into production in just 18 months . It will go on sale next month , with the initial marketing effort in cities that have been strongholds for Datsun ( now the No. 1 selling import ) and Volkswagen . GM 's main target city : Los Angeles , where 49% of all new cars sold in August were built overseas . During the next twelve months , GM hopes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' share of the U.S. market 5% to around 15% . <P> But Chevette 's competition will not come only from imports . Last week Ford announced the Pinto Pony MPG , sticker-priced at $2,895 , $4 below the Chevette and now lower than any other U.S.-built car . In an obvious slap at GM , Ford President Lee lacocca added , " The back seat comes at no extra charge . "
