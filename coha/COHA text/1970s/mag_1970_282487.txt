America is so rich that it has money to burn . In fact , the Treasury Department and most of the nation 's 36 Federal Reserve Banks and branches are now incinerating ( and then replacing ) worn-out bills at the rate of $9 billion a year . The department has now faced up to the fact that this conflagration is a source of air pollution . <P> With impeccable environmental concern , Treasury renounced incinerators in favor of pulverizers-machines that munch money , then pound the shredded paper into compact packages . The first pulverizers will probably be installed in the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank in about six months . Within five years , says Treasury , all of America 's discarded dollars may be recycled into such products as plastics , fiberboard and roofing material . One proposed scheme-using shredded money for building insulation - would give householders the happy illusion of being literally surrounded by millions of greenbacks.
