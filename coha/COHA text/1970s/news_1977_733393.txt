txt Letters Letters The Humphrey-Hawkins Bill 's Promise To the Editor : Your recent editorial called the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment bill a " hollow promise . " The labor , religious , civil rights and other organizations which make up the Full Employment Action Council profoundly disagree with your assessment . This legislation , if enacted , will commit this nation and its leaders to specific targets of 3 percent adult unemployment and 4 percent overall unemployment by 1983 , and require the President and the Congress to pursue policies to achieve these targets and genuine full employment . This revised version contains measures which are absolutely essential to any serious attempt to achieve genuine full employment , including : ( 1 ) Affirmation of the " right of all Americans who are able , willing and seeking to work to full opportunity for useful paid employment at fair rates of compensation , " as a basis for economic policy .

I have griped about taxes , potholes , the Police Department , etc . When something extra special happens I feel I must comment on it . On Friday night , Nov. 4 , I was in my car at First Avenue and 42d Street . I had a heart attack . I asked my wife to call the police . They and an ambulance were at my side in five minutes . My wife does not drive . The police took care of my car . In another 15 minutes I was in the emergency room of Bellevue Hospital . A team of doctors and nurses were waiting for me . They performed with speed , precision , knowledge and confidence . They were truly fantastic . While they were taking care of me they also were kind enough to keep my wife advised and comforted .

( 5 ) Strong anti-inflation , labor standard and nondiscrimination provisions . In addition , the revision retains all of the tools , including last resort public jobs programs , which were contained in the earlier bill . Instead of requiring that the President use all of these measures within a few months of enactment , it requires him to use the various tools to the extent required to reach the mandated goals and timetable for the reduction of unemployment .

When Syria and Egypt decided ? to attack Israel in June , Hussein was begged by the Israelis to stay out of the conflict . He controlled the Old City of Jerusalem ( to which no Israelis were admitted ) and the West Bank ? but , nonetheless , he attacked . Why ? The English-language broadcasts on ( only ) the first day of the war ( which I recorded ) spelled it all out . Israel , they said , was " a den of treachery " and Hussein 's troops were coming in to " give you the beating you well deserve " and to " purify the land with death and destruction . " For good measure , they promised " death and annihilation to all those who dare to resist .

SONNENFELD New York , Nov. 28 , 1977 MarcuseandWeathermen To the Editor : The Nov. 28 letter by Henry Brandon concerning the baleful influence of Herbert Marcuse on the " Baader-Meinhof gang " contained one error of fact so vital that it tends to put his thinking itself into question . Referring to that influence , Brandon writes , " . . . I based it on a conversation I had with Marcuse in October 1966 at the University of California in San Diego . He then acknowledged that the extreme Weatherman student movement got some of its inspiration from his writings . " This would have been a remarkable admission since there was no Weatherman faction in 1966 , nor in 1967 , nor in 1968 . EMILE DE ANTONIO New York , Dec. 5 , 1977 and timetables is not optional . The President could not change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without approval of Congress . Clearly , no one bill will " solve " our unemployment problem and its tragic human and economic costs . More work will be required to translate this ? legislation into meaningful jobs at decent wages for all American workers . However , without this legislation , those battles will probably remain unfought and our nation shall grow ever more accustomed to the enormous waste of our . material and human resources represented ' by massive joblessness . This revised legislation is neither a meaningless gesture nor a costly , inflationary boondoggle . It establishes this country 's commitment to a job for every American , able and willing to work and sets in motion a comprehensive planning process . This legislation would put an end to the cynical process of redefining full employment as 5 , 6 or even 7 percent in order to explain the failure of particular economic policies . It also lays the foundation for the policies and programs needed to fulfill that commitment . Its passage would be a major step toward a more just , ' productive and humane America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Council Washington , Nov. 28 , 1977 On Freeing Dividends Of Double Taxation To the Editor : The report that the White House is not considering an end to double taxa- ' lion of stock dividends until 1980 is baffling in light of what has happened on Wall Street this past year . The Dow Jones has dropped almost 20 percent because , in the view of many analysts , there is a general feeling that the Carter Administration does not understand the needs of business and industry . There is also the very practical and conservative trend to discount stocks which currently pay less in dividends than can be realized in long-term savings accounts , etc . Growth stocks , in particular , have sagged very badly in this climate . Wall Street has been counting on promises to end double taxation of dividends to revive investor interest in stocks . Without this boost , it is not likely that the Dow Jones will recover , and if it does n't recover , it is going to be very difficult for industry to obtain all the capital required for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal as a fuel , to modernize old plants to make them competitive with foreign factories , and generally to expand capacity at a rate that will absorb the workers now unemployed or due to appear on the labor market . . , There are proposals to cut corporate taxes and increase tax benefits for investment in plant , but they seem unlikely to have the immediate , widespread and significant effect on business and investor confidence that ending the crippling and inequitable double taxation on dividends would have . We can not afford three more years of faltering business confidence . There must be a positive signal to get our industrial plant working closer to capacity with modern facilities , will cut unit costs and increase profits , so that neither the rate of inflation nor the drop in tax receipts will prove . a problem . FREDERICK S. LIGHT FOOT Greenpoint , L.I. , Dec. 4 , 1977 The Portrait of a ' Peacemaker ' The Lifesaving New Yorkers The Eskimos Must Now Cooperate in This Whale Conservation Program ' To the Editor : The polemical letter ( Nov. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is typical of the deliberate campaign of misinformation by Eskimos seeking to inflame public opinion . Mr. DuBay happens to be information officer for the Eskimos ' North Slope Borough . In printing his letter , The Times neglected to describe Mr. DuBay 's role . Mr. DuBay claims the U.S. Government conspired to bring about the zero quota on bcmhead whales adopted by the International Whaling Commission in June but since relaxed . The truth is precisely the opposite . The zero quota was voted against U.S. wishes because the U.S. had ignored a 1976 directive from the I.W.C . to institute a management program for bowhead whaling and because the Eskimos themselves refused voluntarily to reduce the massive and wasteful killing that has now made the bowhead the most endangered of all ten species of great whales . Mr. DuBay claims the U.S. delegation to the I.W.C . " labored in secret " without consulting the Eskimos . He ignores the fact that the Eskimo whalers were invited to join in U.S. policy discussions and to send a representative to the I.W.C . as a U.S. delegate . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flatly rejected the offer to participate in the June I.W.C . meeting . Mr. DuBay claims that the whale population and kill statistics are " without any scientific or factual basis . " The population estimates are based on best available . data , much of it provided by the Eskimos . And the kill statistics come almost exclusively from the logbooks of the whalers . Many other assertions of Mr. DuBay are false . For example , there is no truth to his claim that the National Academy of Sciences and the University of Alaska have condemned the Federal action on bowhead whales . Mr. DuBay makes the wild charge that the environmental and animal welfare organizations leading the campaign to save the whales " have played into the hands of the oil companies who would like nothing more than the elimination of the Eskimos from the Arctic . " He ignores the fact that these conservationists are leading the battle to protect the Beaufort Sea , critical habitat for the bowhead , from the ravages of offshore oil drilling . Mr. DuBay claims that the Eskimos have " exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bowhead . How does he explain the hmre inrreaqt in kill in recent years . far beyond the subsistence needs of the 3,000 villagers ? How does he ex'plain the tripling of the number of whaling crews in recent years , from 25 to 75 ? Why was there no restraint during the spring hunt , after the Eskimos had been warned by the Government about the I.W.C . concern ? The I.W.C . has now reinstated a limited bowhead hunt for 1978 based on the traditional subsistence needs of the Eskimos  --  twelve whales killed and landed or 18 whales struck , whichever comes first . The Eskimos must now cooperate in this whale conservation program . As The Times pithily observed in an editorial on Oct. 1 : " If Eskimo culture needs the bowhead , it must be saved ; killing off the few that remain would not long satisfy either stomach or spirit .
