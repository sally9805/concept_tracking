ROldo Bartimole , whose Point of VieW newsletter digs up muck along the banks of the oily Cuyahoga , recalls this scene : Carl Stokes , black Mayor of Cleveland , a national figure , an oft-cited case history of democracy and equality in action , was addressing 1,000 or more people several years ago at a meeting of the Welfare Federation . Stokes put in a few words on the need to listen to dissenting voices . Suddenly Bartimole yelled out something like : " If that 's true , why are the corridors filled with cops from your subversive squad ? " Dave Rothman reports for The Journal of Lorain , Ohio . He writes features and covers the poverty beat , including " the remnants of the public housing program " in , his territory . " I was just burning , " recalls the Italian butcher 's son from Bridgeport , Conn. , " because a few people , myself included , were protesting the fact that the Welfare Federation was having a big dinner when it did n't address itself to the problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd ever seen Stokes at a loss for words , " says Bartimole , an alumnus of The Wall Street Journal . " But he was . He answered , saying he did n't know why they were there . I yelled back , ' Well , you ought to , Mayor , ' and I walked out . " A few years later , under the administration of Cleveland 's present Mayor , Ralph Perk , a Republican conservative , Rol &; Bartimole 's bimonthly revealed that the city 's police department had requested $8,089 from the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration for electronic snooping gear . " We may have our own , Watergate in the future , " wrote Bartimole last fall . " Mayoral candidates are as fair game as Presidential candidates . " Later in - the story he , quoted a pOlice official as saying his department had even bugged ' , Carl Stokes 's private office while Stokes was mayor . The Cleveland Press editorialized about the gear 's possible threat to privacy . Flustered , the police say they bought the equipment not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narcotics fighters who might be in danger . In both his public conduct and his lively newsletter , then , Bartimole can be a burr under the big shots ' saddles . He 'll take on anybody , from charity organizers to media people to bankers . Point of View says that executive E. Mandell de Windt , a big charity man , deserves " a special beat-up Cadillac for ghetto visits . " Another millionaire  --  enriched by government subsidies  --  is " Cleveland 's top welfare recipient . " The Akron Beacon-Journal is accused of having committed an " Akron atrocity " by carrying right winger George Crane 's syndicated column about killing Vietnamese civilians . ' Cleveland TV journalism is " air wave pollution . " But Bartimole is even better at turning up facts than at turning phrases . In an admiring article for Antioch Review , press critic James Aronson offered " a cameo of how Bartimole operates " ? an example worth repeating here . Bartimole considered the Educational and Research Council of America ( ERCA ) a " tool of industry and foundation elites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the guise of a legitimate education research organization . " At first it seemed that the Cleveland Plain Dealer alio saw the council as fair game . The paper , Ohio 's largest , published seven parts of an eight-part expose . But the eighth article did not appear . It said the , research council-shared some directors with the foundations which had pumped about $3 million into it . " A rather clear-cut case of self-dealing , " a Plain Dealer reporter wrote his city editor about the conflict of interest . " What 's wrong with that ? " responded Tom Vail , the Plain Dealer 's conservative editor and publisher . So the Plain Dealer never published the troublesome article . Point of View did . " This suppressed story panicked Tom Vail and his editors , " wrote Bartimole , " for it shows how the elites finance their little conspiracy with tax-free ' foundAtion funds . ERCA corporate conspirators read like a Cleveland Who 's Who . . . . Vail is too dangerous to be allowed to decide what Clevelanders will or will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . " Roldo has an uncanny way of knowing what went on ' at board meetings ' , " says a Cleveland investigative reporter . Indeed some corporate directors may even vote one way at meetings and , feeling guilty , sneak Bartimole the facts supporting the other side . For , the most part , though , Bartimole digs up important information merely by wading through such documents as Federal Communications Commission forms and stockholders ' reports . When the information is shoveled forth , how do people react ? Bartimole 's friends consider him another ? Tom Paine , Ralph Nader or I. F. Stone . His enemies consider him a pain in , the neck : an inveterate cynic , a professional knocker , a twister of facts . And a rather unimportant one at that . The five-year-old Point of View , though slowly growing , has only about 1,200 subscribers . But then , expenses are , as small as circulation . Bartimole claims that his muckraking costs just $100 an issue for materials . Among major expenses : 60-pciund brown paper for the 7-by-10-inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; printing , but not typesetting since the printer merely photographs Bartimole 's typing , done on borrowed IBM Selectrics . Point of View and some free-lance work bring Bartimole about $4,000 a year , the publisher says . He operates from a cluttered corner of the basement of a modest white duplex at 2150 Rex-wood Rd. , Cleveland Heights , just outside Cleveland . One day recently , Bartimole , a somewhat graying and shaggy-haired man of 41 , wore an undershirt and nondescript pants . He looked dressed for yard work . And his . glasses , according to his wife , ' are held together with scrap wire which some kids picked up after the telephone man . Still , it would be wrong to call Bartimole truly ' poor . His newspaper career left him with a 1966 Volvo and money in the bank . And his wife 's family and his own parents buy the three Bartimole children shoes and other presents from time to time . Roldo Bartimole ' attended Northeastern University in Boston on the GI bill , worked part-time in the Boston Globe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several other East Coast papers , including one which he left after the editors grew jittery over his slum housing expos  --  s . Bartimole heard good things about the Plain Dealer from people he " sort of ' respected . " So he came to this city where Rockefeller had , prospered  --  hoping to Write " a , lot about urban problems , education , civil rights , housing . " Instead , Bartimole says , he ended up " running from meeting to meeting " and cranking out what he considered worthless human interest stories . " Kid Gets Caught in Ice Box . ' You go out and talk to the parents . . .. I do n't think you should put people through the bother of having to answer a reporter 's question on ' most of those things . " Bartimole left the ' Plain Dealer for the Akron area 's anti-poverty program but grew disgusted with its board of directors . They came largely from social agencies which he did n't think were doing the job . According to Bartimole , the paper invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He found it more tolerable than general assignment . The editors let him do " full-page stories about poverty and other issues , " Bartimole says . And , he recalls , Vail said , " Great job . " Bartimole , however , disagreed . He resented Vail 's reported claim that the Plain Dealer stories were better than similar ones on which New York Herald Tribune men had spent four weeks . Hearing of Bartimole 's pipe lines into inner-city ghettos , The Wall Street Journal offered him a Cleveland bureau job , and he bit . At an urban affairs conference the day after Martin Luther King was killed , Bartimole found university professors more worried about post-assassination riots than about poverty , racism and the other causes . " That was like the final thing , " says Bartimole , who also disliked the day-to-day business news he . had to file , along with in-depth features . " I could n't go , back to a typewriter and do my daily job with any real feeling about doing it . " So , more indignant about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular , Bartimole quit . What do Bartimole 's bosses think of him ? At the Plain Dealer Vail never returned the calls of a reporter who left word he was inquiring about Bartimole . Managing editor Bob Burdock , who was n't working for the paper during Bartimole 's time there , confesses to reading Xeroxed issues of Point of View . But he says : " I do n't think anybody around here takes him seriously . " Clayton Sutton , retired Cleveland bureau chief of The Wall Street Journal , questioned the value of a story about Bartimole . According to Sutton , Bartimole was " an adequate reporter and left voluntarily . " Bartimole started Point of View with help from friends . One , an ad agency art director , reversed the e in the point of view at the top of the front page  --  in recognition of the difference between Bartimole 's opinions and those of most Clevelanders ! He recruited subscribers from " mailing lists from different organizations , reports and committees and that sort of stuff . " He hoped that Point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could show the real problems of Cleveland . He says business executives think : Why should business stay in the city when  --  just look at it  --  there 's the racial problem . . . the pollution problem . , . the obsolete factories . . . the inadequate transportation . . . the high taxes ... the high land costs . . . ; The manpower already had moved out to the suburbs . So , says Bartimole , business wants to leave Cleveland-and the problems that industry made worse while making money . Bartimole contends that businessmen do n't want to pay the taxes necessary for urban renewal . In fact he thinks they use private charity to draw attention away from more expensive solutions . He blasts local news media for not exposing such " charity cheats . " According to him , some of United Torch 's biggest corporate backers squeeze " Fair Shares " from workers while personally contributing little or nothing . United Torch no longer lists sizes , of individual contributions , and Bartimole just might be the reason . But is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His manners , in and out of print , certainly wo n't dazzle the radical chic . Yet he offers some justification for his brashness when he explains that he flung question after question at an executive without waiting for answers following ' " the most patronizing bullshit speech . . . I ever heard . " Declares Bartimole : " It 's really not fair to high-ranking officials , public and private , to be treated with the reverence most people bestow upon them . They get the false feeling that they are superior , but it 's partly our fault , too . So I feel sort of obliged , particularly in the case of business leaders , to help them with their humility . " Asked to define the operating philosophy behind Point of View , Bartimole says : " It 's not that I expected to make any great changes or have measurable impact . It 's just something that I hope  --  with other kinds of efforts that are being made in society by other people and groups  --  will eventually produce the kinds of changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups " include , say , Cesar Chavez or the " environmental movement " ? " any kind of social protest . " And " changes " include " the ability to express oneself freely and the right not to have to starve in a free society . And . . . I think it 's a change to . . . values that take into account people more than things , that give higher priority to human values than property values and then move away from the kind of consumer society that we have . . . . " Bartimole , however , says of " philosophy " : " I do n't even like the word because it connotes serious thought and reasoned planning . I went into Point of View with relatively little thought as to success or failure or how I would sustain the publication . Or the family . I think people need to have struggle in their lives . I do n't want , for example , to make life ' easier for my children . ' It may be old-fashioned or my Catholic upbringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided the struggle is worth while , naturally . " So , in philosophy or lack of one , has Roldo Bartimole left the world of the butcher shop entirely behind ? With his condemnation of tax loopholes , of " welfare " for the rich , of fat-cat " charity cheats , " of the " consumer society , " the small-time publisher might be sticking up for an older America , as some McGovernites fancied themselves doing . But Bartimole is n't preaching a way of life . He 's living it  --  as the irrepressible muckraker whom a local magazine once called " Cleveland 's knight in rusty armor. "
