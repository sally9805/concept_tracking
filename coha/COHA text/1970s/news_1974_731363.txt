txt It was an ordinary looking press release from the Governor 's office announcing two routine appointments . As usual , the r heading " State of New York , Executive Chamber , Malcolm Wilson , Governor , " appeared in the ? upper left corner . Sunintary of inafor actions by Legislature , Page 52 . Only in the first sentence was something amiss . " Governor Rockefeller , " the press began , " announced today . . .. " It was not the first time that particular mistake had been made and Governor Wilson 's angry staff members conceded it would prob . ably not be the last . signed as Governor , the slip remains as something of a symbol for the special challenge that faces his successor . Malcolm Wilson has to convince the people of New York not only that he is Governor at last , 35 years after he arrived in Albany from Yonkers as a freshman Assemblyman , but also that he deserves to be elected Governor in his own right in the state election this November . Mr. Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor and later , two or three years into his term , on being a candidate . He must be a first-time Governor and a first-time gubernatorial candidate all time to get to know Mr. son . After watching his 20 years as an active Assemblyman and 15 years as Lieutenant Governor , most politicians in the state thought . they would be dealing with ' a known quantity when Mr. Wilson became Governor ? or , to use his phrase , when he was " privileged to assume these responsibilities on Dec. 18 last . " No one expected him to be Nelson Rockefeller , but . few people in Albany have held that against him . Many legislators were frankly tired of being in the shadow of ? Mr. Rockefeller 's overwhelming presence , his grand designs , his ability to bend the Legislature to his will . Many looked forward to Working with " one of our - Own , " a Governor who pledged to them on opening day that he would treat the ? Legislature as a coequal branch of government , a politician they viewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But since then many legistors say they had been baffled by what they felt was the aimlessness of the legislative session and concerned about a Governor whom they think had a penchant for bad timing and a willingness to become bogged down in trivia and ceremony at the expense of decisive leadership .. " The Republicans cried all the time that Rockefeller did n't let them do anything and now that Wilson wo n't tell them what to do , they 're climbing the walls , " said one Democratic legislative leader with a smile .. Comparison Is Drawn A veteran Republican Assemblyman did not smile when he drew the same comparison . " The great thing about Rockefeller was that he was n't a lawyer and had never been a legislator . All he wanted to do was run the world , " the legislator said . " You 'd go in to see him with something and he 'd say : ' Is it good ? Is it bad ? Can we do it ? ' And barn , you 'd have it . Malcolm is a technician ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right places and he 's more likely to give you the Sermon on the Mount . " Others point to an episode about a month ago as an ex -- ample of what they see as the Governor 's misplaced Priorities . When his plane , was snowbound by a freak spring blizzard in Buffalo , he rejected advice to spend a comfortable evening there and instead insisted on being driven through the night over 3po miles of treacherous highways to get back to Albany by morning . He arrived . home at 5 A.M. , " Even iron wears out even ' tually , " one staff member laid , noting that the 60-year ' old Governor 's only public Appearance that morning was As a participant at a forum ' teat could easily have gone bn without him . Some long-time Wilson observers say that such actions reflect his long political apprenticeship , when his mission was to go anywhere as the representative of his party and Governor . Until the business of the Legislature began in earnest about a month ago , Mr. Wilson 's weekly schedule was often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote parts of the state . Nevertheless the party faithful , particularly the upstate county organizations , turn out in record numbers for a glimpse of the Governor , and he scores points just by being willing to make the trip and keep up old acquaintances . Said Herbert B. Ray , an official of the Broome County Republican committee , which drew a record 625 members for a recent dinner with the Governor : " He calls us by name and three-quarters of the people here can consider themselves his personal friend . We love him . " By . touching base with the groups that have formed his natural constituency over the years  --  the upstate regulars , the county chambers of commerce , the organized Roman Catholic groups ? Mr. Wilson proves to people that becoming Governor has not given him airs , that he still deserves their best efforts . The district leaders and party workers who come out to greet the Governor seem to see in him what they would like to see in themselves ? a suburban politician who , without having received any special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albany , even those who do not like Mr. Wilson 's politics and feel no special warmth toward him have come to respect him , for his willingness to stick by the positions he has taken for years . Now that he is in the spotlight , some of those positions may not be good politics , but Mr. Wilson at least impresses people with his c5nsistency . The official biography distributed by Governor Wilson 's office notes that " not since Alfred E. Smith was first elected in 1918 has a man come into the office of Governor with better knowledge , more experience and deeper understanding of the needs of the citizens of the state . " His knowledge is indeed prodigious  --  he stunned a man at a lunch counter in the Delaware County town of Hancock by asking him how the gasoline supply was holding up in Cadosia , a neighboring town whose existence , let along location , is apparently a secret known only to the locals . But the question some politicians here are asking now is whether that long training period did not perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislator but not for a Governor . Passion for Precision At meetings with the legislative leaders , for example , Mr. Wilson will linger on long after the major decisions have been reached and the leaders have gone back to their offices , working out with sometimes startled staff members the precise language of proposed legislation , " He really is still chairman of the codes committee , " one senior Republican staff member exploded after one of these meetings , referring to the important Assembly committee the Governor once headed . " My Gods does n't he realize he 's the Governor yet ? " Aside from Anne Balko , his executive assistant who has been with him ever since she managed his first campaign office in 1938 , Governor Wilson had virtually no staff assistance for most of his career and he is Snot used to relying on other ' people to make his decisions or run his day . In addition , most of the staff around Mr. Wilson are holdovers from the Rockefeller administration , and it is becoming more and more clear to many observers here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style , but also in matters of substance . If Mr. Wilson is elected to a full term in November , he will probably fill these positions with people of his own choosing . So far , of course , he has not said that he is a candidate ; everyone assumes he will be when the State Republicans convene next month . He has never unpacked all the boxes or put many personal touches in his office . Aside from the elegant red room , which is the Governor 's public ceremonial office , the Governor 's private suite is quite ordinary . Mr. Wilson 's framed Navy discharge papers and a few other mementoes have replaced Mr. Rockefeller 's modern art treasures . The Governor is chiefly aided by the two top advisers he himself selected ? Press Secretary Harry J. O'Donnell , the shrewd former press secretary to Governor Dewey , Mayor Lindsay , and the state Nixon re-election effort in 1972 , and Special Assistant L. Richard Guylay , a former advertising man whose experience in national Republican politics goes back almost as far . The unannounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build a record to run on . Ideally , that record will offer something tangible to every major group in the state without needlessly offending any other group . " If you ca n't offer them half a loaf , at least give them a slice , " is how an aide in the Governor 's office described this approach . To that end , Governor Wilson , with the Legislature 's concurrence , has raised welfare benefits , although only to 1972 levels ; given women a guarantee against discrimination in banking , but not the maternity disability benefits the state 's industry lobby feared ; promised the United Federation of Teachers a review of the Taylor law ; and saved the New York City transit fares until barely past the November elections . But many politicians here contend that he has also allowed himself to be outflanked on campaign reform by his chief Republican rival , Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea ; outmaneuvered on aid to education by other members of his party , and avoided coming up with a promised proposal for court reform . At the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or politely dismantle some of the pet projects of the last Rockefeller years . He cut $20,000 from the salary of the chairman of the state Racing and Wagering Board , has said not a word about the proposed sports complex in Sunnyside , Queens , and seems prepared to let- expire the -- I standing and controversial idea of a fourth metropolitan area jet airport at Newburgh . Politicians here who have looked for purely political motivations in Governor Wilson 's activities , are gradually coming to suspect that more than politics motivates the man they thought they knew . This is a difficult premise for this cynical capital to accept , jaded as it , . is by generations of politicians pledging to be influenced only by a desire to do what is right . Governor Wilson says this in public too , of course , but he says it in private as well , and on a number of important issues he seems to have rejected political expediency for the sake of a strongly held view on the philosophy of government . In explaining his 11 per centincerase in welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The least of the brethren , " as when he told a group of Binghamton Republicans : " Any society that professes to be civilized must recognize that there is a prior lien on the public purse on the part of the least of the brethren , those who in the dispensation of Providence have no spokesman except the conscience of the people . " " ' The essence of tyranny is the denial of complexity , ' Governor Wilson often says , quoting the Swiss historian Jacob Burhardt . He uses the quotation to warn listeners not to expect easy or predictable solutions to complicated problems . But those who would deny Malcolm on notice as well . He can be charming and courtly and funny , as when he regaled legislators with a song-and-dance act at a recent dinner in honor of Mr. Duryea . On the other hand , he can speak of himself in full third-person formality as " the Governor " and fix his light blue eyes in such a penetrating stare that the other person has to blink first . - Women have often described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have taken pains to improve his standing with this half of the electorate . Women usually chuckle appreciatively when he quotes a female Mayor of Quebec who once complained that women have to be twice as good as men to get half the credit . " Fortunately , " the story ends , " that 's not very difficult . " And if the mood is right he can laugh at himself , even on the one subject about which he seems most sensitive , the comparison with Governor Rockefeller . Arriving at a Republican gathering in Binghamton on March 21 after a perilous four-hour drive through freezing rain , Mr. Wilson pointed out that " no other Governor has brought you snow and sleet on the first day of spring . " He recalled that he had come to the dinner many times in the past in his former role as Lieutenant Governor . " It seems so natural that Nelson Rockefeller should be . Governor , " he went on , " that as I was coming here I thought of that television commercial : ' It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
