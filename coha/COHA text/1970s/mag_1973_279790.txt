" Women 's Lib Has No Soul . " So proclaims the cover of the latest issue of Encore , the black newsmagazine . Inside , an essay by Psychologist Rose Finkenstaedt condemns the feminist movement as " little more than the hysterical exhibitionism of spoiled children . " To blacks , adds Editor-Publisher Ida Lewis , Women 's Lib is merely " a playtoy for middle-class white women . " At first reading , Encore 's broadside sounds too extreme to reflect the outlook of more than a few blacks . But in interviews with TIME correspondents across the nation last week , many black women agreed with the magazine 's stand . Although black women are perhaps the most oppressed members of their sex , they are generally the least enthusiastic about Women 's Liberation . <P> Black women have a simple explanation for their coolness toward the feminist movement-they believe that they are oppressed not by black men but by white society . As a result , most of them prefer to confine their crusading to such basic questions as employment , housing , education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , " Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm sums up , " picketing a club restricted to men or insisting on the title Ms. are not burning issues . " <P> Even the more important Women 's Lib causes , such as abortions on request or the Equal Rights Amendment , fail to stir the black community . To many blacks , explains Jean Noble , executive director of the National Council of Negro Women , " abortion is genocidal , a method of limiting the black population . Muslim groups , for instance , say that the role of the black woman is to produce warriors for the revolution . " Of the Equal Rights Amendment , Noble says , " I call it the liftin ' and totin ' bill . More than half of the black women with jobs work in service occupations ; if the amendment becomes law , we will be the ones liftin ' and totin ' , so passage of ERA is not our first priority . " <P> Black women also find it difficult to identify with a movement that is essentially a middle-and upper-middle-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacks who belong to the feminist group NOW , points out that a vast number of blacks still exist close to the poverty level or even below it . Snaps Black Actress Val Gray : " I ca n't address myself to the problems of a woman in Highland Park a white , upper-middle-class Chicago suburb when she is trying to get out of her kitchen and I 'm in her kitchen as a maid . " <P> Sheila Young , executive editor of Essence magazine , agrees . " We have n't had the comforts to get tired of . We have n't had the big house or the country club to bore us . " In fact , when black women express discontent with their female roles , it is often because they already have more liberation than they want . They tend , however , to call it responsibility , since they frequently work not by choice but out of the need to support their families .
