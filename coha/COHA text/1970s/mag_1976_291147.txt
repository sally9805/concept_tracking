The Mafia , for once , was not involved . The masterminds who pulled off Italy 's ripest heist of the year are just greedy cheese merchants who smelled a good thing . When the Italian government last spring auctioned off 19,000 tons of Parmesan cheese that it had bought to support falling prices , a few wholesalers snapped up practically the whole lot-in effect , cornering the market . Ever since , the speculators have released their hoard of the golden , crumbly protein-rich cheese only when supplies were scarce . <P> As a result , retail prices of Parmesan in many stores have nearly doubled , from $2.70 a pound in midsummer to $4.70 a pound currently . The price hike caused an outpouring of rage . " Bastaf " cried desperate Italian housewives , forced to turn up their noses at the fragrant wheels stacked on their grocers-shelves . " When Parmesan went up to $4 a pound , " said one Milanese widow living on a pension , " I told my grocer to eat it himself . " <P> Too Passive . Biagio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went even further . He organized Italy 's first real consumer boycott . Soon the cramped office of his all-volunteer Confederation of Consumers was filled with irate housewives eager to demonstrate or to sign petitions calling for an investigation . Says Morelli , who charges that the wholesalers made $40 million profit on the operation : " People always said the Italian consumer was too passive and uninformed to be organized . Yet look at the effect we 've had . " <P> The boycott , together with high prices , has cut Parmesan consumption by half . It has also inspired the government to enact a punitive measure calling for four-year prison terms and fines of up to $120,000 for anyone found guilty of keeping essential goods off the market for private gain . Some of the Parmesan speculators may yet be arrested on such charges .
