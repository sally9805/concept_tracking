One of the worst threats hanging over the economy has been the prospect that 120,000 members of the United Mine Workers would stop digging coal next week , when their union contracts expire . A mine strike would reduce U.S. energy supplies more than the Arab oil embargo last winter did ; it would cause factory shutdowns and layoffs in industries far beyond the coal fields , and it would seriously worsen the gathering recession . For a while , a strike had seemed almost inevitable . But late last week the outlook brightened a bit , and the chance improved for the nation to avoid a long , damaging coal strike after all-though at the heavy price of a settlement that will add to inflationary pressures . <P> Feisty Mood . As the week ended , union and management negotiators made some encouraging progress . They had been racing a kind of deadline within a deadline : a new contract had to be on the table early this week if rank-and-file miners were to be able to ratify it in a union-wide vote by the Nov. 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was still a chance that they could succeed-and it would then be up to the miners themselves to decide whether the pits could be kept open . <P> If a pact really is signed and ratified , the nation can only heave a sigh of relief . Peace seems to have been won essentially by the coal operators caving in to the union 's insistence on wage and benefit increases roughly equal to the 39% over three years that 1.4 million steelworkers won last April , plus a long list of costly noneconomic demands . Even so , those demands are better met without a strike than after a walkout that could have crippled the economy . <P> Going into the negotiations , the rank and file were in a feisty mood and fully aware of their new power in an era of scarcer , costlier energy . Expressing the attitude of the majority , West Virginia Miner Jim ( " Catfish " ) Barlow , 27 , said : " This time we are going to get something or we 're going to shut down everything-everything . I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na be too late . " <P> The union in early September handed the coal companies a 54-page list of demands . They covered improved training and grievance procedures , greater participation in determining work schedules , and a number of safety provisions , including the right of a miner to leave his place at work if he feels that he is in imminent danger . The U.M.W. also demanded a big increase in pensions , which now provide retired miners with a maximum of $150 a month ( v. $625 for auto workers ) , plus a cost-of-living escalator . All that in addition to a basic wage increase at least as fat as the one in steel . A steel-type settlement would theoretically raise the average hourly wage in the mines by 20% in the first year , to $7.40 ; that would put the miners ahead of both the steelworkers ( average hourly wage : $7.13 ) and the auto workers ( $5.63 ) . The miners argue that their pay has risen much less than the price of coal , which has jumped from $7.07 a ton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices ( for immediate delivery ) leaping as high as $120 a ton . They also point to coal companies ' profits : at some large firms , earnings have tripled and even quadrupled this year .
