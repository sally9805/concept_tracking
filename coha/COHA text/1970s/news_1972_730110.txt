txt You , the American consumer , have just rescued a major consumer bill from oblivion . As the result of your letters to members of Congress , there 'll probably be a new law this year that will require automakers to build sturdier cars . Collectively you consumers stand to save $1 billion a year in auto repairs . Two weeks ago a key House committee caved in to pressure from automakers and killed a weak auto-repair bill . Nearly everybody in Washington thought the issue was dead as the proverbial doornail . Then you consumers picked up ballpoint pens and wrote your congressmen . You did n't like the fragility of today 's cars and said so . Committee members of the Housecommittee looked toward the November election , decided they wanted your votes , and felt very uneasy . The committee voted again April 18 on the auto-repair issue . In a highly unusual move it approved a stronger auto-repair bill than the one it had killed two weeks earlier . Passage expected You consumers caused the turnaround  --  those of you who wrote and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stand . Sources close to the committee think opponents of the bill probably could have mustered the votes to defeat it  --  if they had dared . " They had the votes , if they had used them , " says one source . But they decided " they 'd rather give consumers a bill than an election-year issue , " he says . And they did . // * Auto-repair legislation saved from scrapyard // Prospects now are for House passage of the bill before long . Since the Senate already has passed a similar and wider-ranging bill , there then would be a Senate-House ! conference to iron out differences . The House bill would require the Secretary of Transportation to set standards for front and rear bumpers which automakers would have to meet . The standards would have to require that cars could survive low-speed crashes front and rear with greatly reduced damage . How much damage , is left to the Transportation Secretary 's discretion . It also would be up to him determine the speed of the crashes that the cars must survive ; from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no less . Legislation similar The bill is similar to present law , which soon will require that cars be able to survive low speed front and rear crashes without damage to safety-related equipment such as lights and tires . But tests have shown that hundreds of dollars of sheet-metal damage can be done in collision without damage to this equipment . Thus the need for this new bill , proponents argued . While consumers take a well-deserved bow for their letters , they had plenty of help on this issue . Consumer sources on the House committee credit scathing newspaper stories and editorials with having helped pressure members of Congress ? and , of course , with having alerted consumers . Organized consumer groups stepped up pressure on committee members ; so did labor groups . " The insurance lobby went into high gear on this , " in the words of one source . Persuasion utilized Last there was what could be called persuading from proponents of the measure in the House , led by Reps . John E. Moss ( D ) of California , Bob Eckhard ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D ) of West Virginia . The first two are long-time con ? sumer champions who are members of the subcommittee that dealt with the bill . Mr. Staggers is chairman of the parent Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee . By exerting a little persuasion and pressure , they got one of the seven subcommittee members to reverse his stand and support the bumper bill . That gave them a 4-to-3 advantage , instead of the frequent 4-to-3 disadvantage  --  and the bill was on its way .
