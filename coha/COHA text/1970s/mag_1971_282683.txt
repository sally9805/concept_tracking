Each year New Jersey beaches are swept by a " red tide " of tiny organisms that redden the sea , give swimmers rashes and threaten the shore area 's ecology and economy . Health officials trace this phenomenon to the " dead sea " outside New York Harbor , a region devoid of marine life where barges routinely dump the city 's garbage and sludge ( treated sewage ) . To worsen matters . New Jersey itself dumps sludge offshore , and so does Pennsylvania . <P> Last week New Jersey Governor William T. Cahill took drastic action . He signed a bill that could force his state 's dumpers to move as far out as the continental shelf-in some places 100 miles offshore . The bill poses some complex problems . It may cost sludge-barge operators more than $50 million a year for oceangoing tugs and crews . It will not stop New York City and Philadelphia from continuing to dump their own muck into New Jersey waters . Nor will Cahill 's suggested limit help the Atlantic , which is already partially polluted . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even clean up some filthy beaches . As he put it : " We must realize that we can no longer throw our wastes away because there is no ' away . ' " <P> <P> Though no tankers have foundered around Bermuda , there are ominous signs of growing oil pollution in the area . For one , the island 's famous pink beaches are now marred by traces of tar . Another sign shows up in studies made by David Wingate , a government conservationist . In 1968 , he found oil clotting the underfeathers of 1 in every 100 longtails , a graceful sea bird that breeds in Bermuda . This year the ratio rose to 1 in 4 . Wingate believes that floating particles of tar-perhaps caused by tankers pumping , out their tanks , smear the birds as they sit on the water . Since longtails die if oil sticks to their wings or is eaten in preening , their numbers are declining . <P> But Wingate also reports a bright spot amid the goo . The Bermuda cahow , a rare marine bird supposedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staging a comeback . This year the world 's last 24 pairs of cahows have produced twelve healthy chicks . A likely reason , Wingate thinks , might be that the rising tide of floating tar is at least temporarily absorbing the harmful pesticides . <P> In most states , gasoline taxes build roads-inviting more cars , more taxes , more roads and so on . Oregon has a different idea . In the nation 's most anti- " growth " state , where bumper stickers proclaim SAVE OREGON FOR OREGONIANS , the legislature has just passed a bill that would channel 1% of all state gas-tax revenues into building bicycle lanes and footpaths . These paths would be built along highways , streets and in parks . The bill also says that the state may restrict paths to nonmotorized vehicles . If Governor Tom McCall signs the bill into law , Oregon 's biennial budget will include about $2.6 million for pedalers and pedestrians . Last week the U.S. Transportation Department promised to supplement state funds for bike-path construction , hiking Oregon 's potential two-year take to as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
