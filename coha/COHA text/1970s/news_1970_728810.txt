txt " Big John " ' Griner , the bulky six-foot president of the American Federation of Government Employes , has laid in a supply of his favorite laryngitis medicine . He is n't suffering yet . Rather , his secretary explained to Mr. Griner 's physician in Washington the other day ; he was just stocking up for the biennial convention , opening today in Denver , of the largest union of Federal employes . " You should come out to the convention , " she told the puzzled doctor , " and you 'd understand . " He would indeed . Mr. Griner can expect heavy strain on his voice , and on his nerves as well . Militant delegates are preparing to push their moderate chief to be more aggressive in representing them . The convention 's actions may renew the threat of strikes against the Government and may bring stiffer pay pressures that could sink Uncle Sam deeper into the red . A Change in Stance Though the union 's actual membership is just over 300,000 , it claims bargaining rights for 600,000 Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its membership is particularly strong in the Labor and Defense Departments , the Social Security Administration and the Veterans Administration . The no-strike clause in the AFGE constitution is almost certain to be weakened or eliminated at this week 's convention . At the last convention , Mr. Griner dramatically defeated a , move to delete the clause by threatening to resign if it were passed . Now his stand has changed . " I 've always opposed the right to strike , but we face a situation today where the Government is bringing on itself a case where employes , particularly in the lower ( pay ) classifications , are going to withhold their services no matter what I try to do , " Mr. Griner warned a Congressional subcommittee a few days ago . It was probably the most militant note sounded so far by the Georgian , who has long been known for his lowkey , law-abiding approach . Though the law still bans strikes by Government employes , Mr. Griner 's members are mindful that postal workers  --  who have their own unions ? walked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group of delegates from over 30 Veterans Administration hospitals is threatening to strike if the convention does n't act to help them get pay adjustments . ' Out of the Denver convention , in any case , will probably come a strong call for full bargaining rights for all Civil Service employes : Their pay rates would be set by negotiation with Government executives rather than through legislation . The postal workers have already won this privilege . Seeking a Fifth Term What 's more , some union militants have teamed with political enemies of Mr. Griner to mount the most serious effort to defeat him since he was first elected president in 1962 . Though the AFGE Committee for Progress in 1970 stands little chance of unseating Mr. Griner in his bid for a fifth two-year term , its campaign is fueling the discontent . " This convention will make the Democratic convention in Chicago look like a picnic , " predicts a Griner backer only half in jest . The union chief himself concedes the mood of the delegates is n't going to be mellowed by Congressional passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't go to other Federal workers .  - -  -  Ever since last spring 's postal strike , Mr. Griner has been getting more and more heat from his membership . He calls rank-and-file unrest his " major problem " these days . Half - of the 63-yearold AFGE leader 's travels since the mailmen 's walkout , aides estimate , have been required to cool down " uprisings by militants " in the union . Among the loudest complaints : Pay in the Government trails pay in private employment , and Uncle Sam is moving too slowly toward the Federal goal of " comparability " with industry . If the union 's militants ever work them , selves up to the point of striking , the effect would , of course , be felt most keenly in those agencies  --  Labor , Defense and the Social Security and Veterans Administrations  --  where the AFGE is strongest . But Mr. Griner doubts that a strike by his members could ever be effective , simply because they are n't concentrated in vital facilities as the postmen are . - Bold Defiance of Law The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikes points up the contrast between them and Mr. Griner . Members of the State , County and Municipal Employes Union and the American Federation of Teachers as well as the postal unions have boldly struck in defiance of law ; they have often managed to win attractive pay increases , with a minimum of punishment . Yet Mr. Gil. ner has clung to the traditional Federal employe union techniques of lobbying and cajoling on Capitol Hill and in the Executive Branch . Now even AFGE officers friendly to Mi . Griner feel a change is due . " Our sister unions have far outstripped usr , ' . ! frets Joseph Gleason , an AFGE national vide president and a long-time Griner backer . " Our entire set of attitudes  --  especially the geed ; guys routine at the table of Congress  --  has : to be changed , " he declares . An officer of a Veterans Administration local , who also supports the union chief , warns that " if he ( Griner ) is n't a little more militant , we 'll have to ' do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vincent , chairman of the Committee for Progress and president of a Tennessee local , says , " Grinir'ir made a great contribution , but the times have passed him by . " Mr. Vincent claims " some locals will stop paying dues unless the leadership becomes more militant ; they 're no longer content to pay dues into a social club . " In Oklahoma , a spokesman for a group of dissidents in AFGE Local 916 at Tinker Air Force Base claims that the unit 's membership has declined to 7,100 from nearly 9,000 less than five years ago because of the " indifferent attitude " of Mr. Griner and other union officials . The insurgent predicts that the local will lose another 2,000 members by September if " changes ( in leadership ) are not made nationally as well as locally . " Mr. ( Griner , who 's acknowledged a hard worker ( 14 hours a day and 200,000 miles of traveling a year ) even by many of his critics , replies in his calm drawl : " We 're molding this federation into more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long way to go . " Tom Smith , a candidate for national secretary-treasurer and a Griner supporter , agrees : " Six years ago , we were 50 years behind the rest of the labor movement ; today , we 're only 25 years behind . We 've come a long way . " Indeed , the union 's membership under Mr. Griner has soared to about 315,000 today from only 106,000 in 1962 . ( Its nearest rival , the National Association of Government Employes , is less than one-third as big . ) Because it also holds bargaining rights for many nonmembers , it now claims to represent more than a quarter of the 2.2 million Civil Service workers , though the last official tally made last November showed less . Mr. Griner has come a long way , too . After graduating from the Camilla , Ga. , high school in 1924 , he worked for various railroads for 11 years . He went to work for the Government 's Railroad Retirement Board in 1936 , eventually becoming a labor relations officer in 1951 . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a national vice president of AFGE in 1916 . He moved up to the AFGE presidency in 1962 and last fall won election to the policymaking executive council of the AFL-CIO . The seat on the council may help Mr .. Griner lead the way to AFL-CIO President George Meany 's goal of " a new day in Federal employer-employe relationships . " In any case , it has made Mr. Griner 's handling of this week 's convention of greater-than-usual interest to the labor movement " The AFGE could become one of the most important unions in the country , " says an official of a large AFL-CIO affiliate , " but I have a great feeling that Griner ca n't cut the mustard . " Convention consideration of the no-strike clause is expected to spr the most debate . Mr. Griner , squinting as he 's prone to do when tackling a ticklish point , concedes his position has changed . He says he wo n't fight a modification that might make the AFGE constitution say only that " this organization is opposed to strikes or picketing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will not engage in strikes . " Daniel Kearney , an AFGE vice president who is the Committee for Progress ' presidential candidate , promises that the insurgents , if elected , " would press for the right to strike in certain instances . " He explains : " Some services are n't so essential . In those situations , we should have the opportunity to seek redress of our grievances by striking . " A Law-Abiding Citizen Mr. Gleason , who 's backing Mr. Griner for the presidency , wants the no-strike clause removed , too . " If our people are ever compelled to do it ( strike ) , " he argues , " at least their own union should n't have to punish them . " An ? other reason for his position : A recent straw poll taken by a local in New York and New Jersey showed over 80% of those responding would support a move to call in sick at the same time for at least two days ' duration . Mr. Griner , however , contends that no more than 15% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ever called . " It would take 90% or more to make a strike work , " he figures . And in a voice quavering slightly with emotion , he declares : " The law says you ca n't strike . As an individual , I 'm a law-abiding citizen and the great majority of the membership is . We 're bound by the law . " But Tom Smith , who heads the AFGE 's largest local , a 14,000-member unit at the Social Security headquarters in Baltimore , contends Mr. Griner is likely to change his views eventually . Mr. Smith 's reasoning : " John Griner is going to follow his people 's feelings . So when everyone decides to go ( on strike ) , he would support it ; he 'd have to . " Some delegates to this week 's convention appear ready to force the strike issue . Mrs. Ruth Beecher , secretary-treasurer of a VA hospital local in Batavia , N.Y. , warns that the militant VA hospital delegates , representing over 30 locals from 14 states , are " willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a revamping of the VA 's procedures for classifying jobs ; the group claims many of its members are paid less than employes in comparable jobs in other agencies . Open Threats of Strike Mr. Griner says he 's been promised " relief " for the hospital workers . But Mrs. Beecher warns that " the members of our group are determined to get some kind of specific action taken by the convention . If something is n't done , all hell is going to break loose . " Others talk openly of the possibility of a strike . The gains won by the postal workers in their first bargaining fiver pay are expected to spark substantial support among the delegates for applying the concept for other Government workers . The AFL-CIO has said it will propose such a bill shortly . Until recently Mr. Griner had shown little enthusiasm for the idea . " It 's coming , " he now declares . " It 's right upon us . " Still , he suggests that it will be " a long time " before he will be ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The present arrangement that lets Federal , employe unions negotiate only such matters as working conditions , grievance procedures and promotion policies , and not on pay , is one the AFGE president has apparently mastered . The union 's growth has been aided greatly by his skillful lobbying in Congress , at the Civil Service Commission and with the bureaucrats who are ' his members ' bosses . ? Last year he was able to block a pay bill that would have given postal workers a raise almost double that slated for all other Federal employes . And during the postal bargaining last spring , he wangled a promise from key legislators that the initial 6% wage boost won by the mailmen would also go to all whitecollar employes . But he has n't been able to fulfill his April promise that AFGE would win Congressional approval by July 1 of pay raises averaging at least 10% for all Federal workers and a $6,000 minimum annual salary . One of AFGE 's best friends on Capitol Hill until his defeat in 1968 was Sen. Mike Monroney , Oklahoma Democrat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , " Mr. Monroney says . " He 's reasonable and appreciative . He 's forceful , but not an antagonizing person . He boils over , cools down , and then boils over again until he 's got ill he can . " Mr. Griner 's secret at the Civil Service Commission , a top official confides , is that " he inches his way to a lot of progress . " The official continues : " He rants and raves and gets very emotional . Yet he always makes clear that his demands are negotiable . And he 's usually ready to settle for 50% of what he 's asking for . " Providing Help and Advice A mainspring in the AFGE 's growth , according to Mr. Griner , has been his emphasis on providing help and advice to members who were confused or abused by the Government 's personnel regulations . Since he became president , the number of full-time AFGE field representatives has been increased to 120 from a tiny 13 . An education program has taught hundreds of local officials how to better unravel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rapid membership growth since 1962 has provided the wherewithal for the expanded field staff and education programs . The annual budget has climbed to $4.8 million from only $955,000 eight years ago . But now , Mr. Griner concedes , the union 's growth rate has slowed sharply . He estimates the union is showing a net gain of about 1,000 members a month . " Back in 1966 , " recalls an AFGE staffer , " we were picking up recruits like crazy  --  often 5,000 members a month . " One reason for the slowdown is that layoffs , especially in the Defense Department , have drained away some members . But another aspect of the slowdown raises a fundamental question about future growth . Much of AFGE 's rapid expansion during the 1960s came among Federal blue-collar workers- , many of whom had union backgrounds ; now the AFGE recruiters are turning more toward Uncle Sam 's white-collar employes , and Mr. Griner admits the going is tougher . Only 29% of them are organized thus far .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
