" My husband , " Erma Bombeck cheerily told a visitor last week , " works as a supervisor of social studies for secondary schools , and if you have a space between your teeth that 's hard to say . " Syndicated Columnist Erma has a big space between her own front teeth . She also has , by her description , " fat calves , unmanicured hands , makeupless eyes " and is " overweight , overworked , over-childrened and underpatienced . " But one thing is clearly going for her : irresistible humor about the trials of being a housewife . <P> The humor shows in her antic put-ons and putdowns , mostly of herself . It shows in her laughter , a corroboree of chuckles , whinnies and convulsions . And it shows in her writing . Simple in style , mundane in subject matter , her thrice-weekly column for 200 newspapers ( including the Chicago Sun-Times and the Boston Globe ) has a title that precisely conveys her puckish point of view . She calls it " At Wit 's End . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporter for the Dayton Journal Herald , is her unfashionable fascination with being a housewife . Her beat , she once wrote , is the utility room . <P> If Onassis Knocks . It sounds dreary , but Erma can stir smiles with columns on how to handle a dirty oven ( " If it wo n't catch fire today , clean it tomorrow " ) , hand-me-down clothes , daytime naps , gardening , sibling rivalry ( " Who gets the fruit cocktail with the lone cherry on top ? " ) , chewing gum , home barbering and the ids of March . " If a woman is ever to have an affair " a recent column began , " it will be in March . Psychologically , it is a perfect month . The bowling tournaments are over . The white sales on bedding are past . Your chest cold has stabilized and the Avon lady is beginning to look like Tom Jones . " <P> Few of Erma 's columns deal with such dreams of an everyday housewife , or even with easy big issues like abortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sample , on the perils of being without an ordinary pencil : " If Onassis knocked on the door and wanted to buy our house for a highway phone booth , I would have to sign the agreement with ( a ) an eyebrow pencil , ( b ) yellow crayon , ( c ) cotton swab saturated in shoe polish , ( d ) an eyedropper filled with cake coloring , or ( e ) a sharp fingernail dipped in my own blood . " <P> Erma has been called a champion of the Great Silent Majority . That upsets her . For one thing , she is a staunch Democrat . Worse , " it sounds like I 'm totally uninvolved-like being a ski instructor in Berlin during World War II . " She has been criticized for not championing the feminist revolution . That suits her fine . Most of the revolutionaries , she says , " are just like roller-derby dropouts , or Russian pole-vaulting types . " The uncharacteristic club is quickly replaced by a tickling feather . She adds : " When I make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bra yet ? ' I tell them I took a halfway measure : I scorched mine on the ironing board . "
