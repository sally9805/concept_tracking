txt THE BREATHING MECHANISM lungs and there is not usually any expiratory activity in the abdominal muscles . When the depth of respiration is increased considerably , the abdominal muscles contract only towards the end of expiration when the force of elastic recoil is at a minimum . As the ventilation is further increased , the intensity of contraction increases and begins earlier in expiration . Vigorous contraction occurs in all voluntary expiratory man euvres such as the expulsion of reserve air , maximum voluntary ventilation , and in such activities as coughing , straining and vomiting . Contraction of a slight to moderate intensity has been noted during ordinary speech by Campbell , although quite a loud sound can be produced without the use of the abdominal muscles if a maximum inspiration is used to obtain maximum elastic recoil . Contraction of the abdominal muscles is necessary to develop any significantly raised intra-thoracic ( intrapleural ) pressure because , if the intra-abdominal pressure were not raised in conjunction with reduction in the volume of the bony skeleton of the thorax , a rise in intra-thoracic pressure would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Respiration There are a number of accessory muscles which may take part but which do not , in normal circumstances , play a significant role in inspiration . The most important of these are the scaleni and the // sternomastoid muscles . These , and other muscles which normally only contract at the end of a maximum inspiration , connect the upper ribs and sternum to the collar-bone and neck . Contraction of these muscles helps to raise the upper ribs and thus increase the capacity of the upper chest to a certain extent . In addition to actual respiratory efforts , any action which raises the shoulders and tenses or bends the neck brings these muscles into tension . Another muscle of respiration over which the singer has voluntary control is the latissimus dorsi . This muscle contains fibres which arise from the lower three or four ribs and which might be able to elevate the ribs , thus facilitating inspiration . Contraction of the muscle as a whole , however , compresses the lower thorax and can therefore assist expiration . The main mass of the muscle can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not normally active in respira tion except during deep inspiration . When voluntarily tensed , this muscle can be felt by placing the hands in the small of the back . This muscle is brought into play more strongly whenever a high support is necessary ( see page 103 ) . PHYSIOLOGY OF RESPIRATION In order that the normal functions of the body may be carried out , it is necessary that all the tissues are continuously supplied with sufficient amounts of oxygen . At the same time , the carbon dioxide produced in the tissues must be removed . Oxygen is obtained from the air taken into the lungs during inspiration and exchanged for carbon dioxide which is removed at the succeeding expiration . In // order that bodily needs may be met , it is necessary that sufficient air is taken into the lungs . The amount of air inspired during each respiration is called Tidal Volume . In a resting adult this is approximately 500 c.c. ( 1 pint ) . After a normal inspiration , the maximal amount of air that can be inspired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,600 c.c. ( 3 pints ) . A similar amount of air can be expelled from the lungs at the end of a normal expiration and this volume is termed Expiratory Reserve Volume . At the end of a maximal expiration , there remains a substantial amount of air in the lungs ( around 1,000 c.c. ) which is known as Residual Volume . VENTILATION The process whereby , as inspiration alternates with expiration , fresh air enters the respiratory tract and an equal amount of pulmonary gas is exhaled is known as ventilation . The respiratory tract is composed of the conducting airway ( nose , mouth , pharynx , larynx , trachea , bronchi and brochioli ) and the alveoli . Rapid gas exchange of oxygen ( 02 ) and carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) occurs only in the alveoli ? not in the conducting airway . It is the amount of inspired air that enters the alveoli each minute ( alveolar ventilation ) which is of greatest importance . Alveolar ventilation depends not only on the total amount of air inspired but also upon the frequency of respiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , in 32 shallow breaths or 16 deeper breaths and , in each case , there will be a considerable difference in the amount of alveolar ventilation . This is because at each breath , no matter how deep , about 150 c.c. of fresh air never reaches the alveoli but remains in the conducting airway which , for the purposes of calculating alveolar ventilation , is termed respiratory dead space . During the following expiration , this fresh air in the dead space is exhaled first , to be replaced as expiration proceeds , by gas from the lungs ? air containing a high proportion of carbon dioxide . At the beginning of the next inspiration , this alveolar gas from the dead space is drawn back into the lungs before the incoming fresh air . Exactly the same quantity of dead space air is thus lost ' in a shallow breath as in a breath of greater depth , and the shallower the breath , the greater is the proportion of inspired air which does not take part in alveolar ventilation . Also , the gfeater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of dead space loss . // In the following examples ( Fig. 18 ) we have three different types of breathing : ( A ) rapid and shallow , ( B ) normal , and ( C ) slow and deep . In each case , the minute volume ( total amount of inspired air per minute ) is 8,000 c.c . However , in A , where this volume has been produced by 32 shallow breaths , the difference between alveolar ventilation and total inspiration is 32 times the dead space volume of 150 c.c. ? a total of 4,800 c.c . In B , where the 8,000 c.c. /min. has been obtained in only 16 breaths , the difference is only 16 times 150 c.c. or 2,400 c.c. while in C , the loss is only 1,200 c.c . These figures show that if the normal frequency is halved , the depth of respiration need only be increased by approximately 70 per cent ( not doubled ) in order to obtain the same degree of alveolar ventila tion . This fact is of importance in singing where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventilation ? one , however , over which the indi vidual has no control ? is the distribution of air in the lungs . // It is important not only for sufficient air to reach the alveoli , but this air must also be evenly distributed . The form of the human lung is very complex , the airways being divided and subdivided a great number of times . In such a lung , even though it is healthy , alveolar ventilation is not absolutely uniform . In various disorders , alveolar ventilation may be decidedly uneven . Thus , in the same individual , poorly ventilated areas may exist side by side with areas in which the ventilation is excessive . In such a case , bodily requirements may not be met even though the minute volume and total alveolar ventilation be normal or increased . This is because ventilation in excess of requirements , whether in the whole or in any part of the lung , con-tributes nothing extra to oxygen ization of the blood ? a fact which is important to the singer and which will be further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the molecules of oxygen pass through the walls of the alveoli and capillary membranes into the bloodstream where they must pass through the plasma , the red blood cell membrane and intracellular fluid in order to reach and combine with haemoglobin in the red blood cells . This is achieved by a process of diffusion , i.e. molecules of oxygen move from a region of higher partial pressure to one of lower partial pressure . At the same time molecules of carbon dioxide pass from the blood into the alveoli by the same process . To understand diffusion , we must under-stand that the pressure exerted by each single gas in a gaseous mixture is independent of other gases in the mixture . The pressure of each gas is known as the partial pressure while the total pressure of the mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures , i.e. a sum of the separate pressures which each would exert if it alone occupied the whole volume . If the quantity of gas is increased in the same space , the pressure rises proportionately . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure of the gas.2 The following examples will serve to describe the above process . Let us say that a certain volume of alveolar gas with high PO2 ( high oxygen pressure ) comes in contact with a certain volume of venous blood with low PO2 . Molecules of oxygen will pass from the alveoli into the blood until the pressures are equalized . If the PO2 of the same quantity of blood was lower before diffusion , the alveolar PO2 and blood PO2 would also be lower after diffusion had taken place // because a greater quantity of oxygen would have to be transferred to this same quantity of blood before the pressures would be equalized . If , on the other hand , the PO2 of the blood remained the same but the total quantity of blood coming into contact with the alveoli is increased , a similar result would be obtained , i.e. lower PO2 in both blood and alveoli after gas exchange had taken place . In this case , the quantity of inspired air ( i.e. ventilation ) or the alveolar PO2 would have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree . Diffusion of carbon dioxide occurs in a similar manner except that the molecules of carbon dioxide pass from the blood into the alveoli . BLOOD CIRCULATION Venous blood flows from the tissues to the lungs in order that there it may give off carbon dioxide and receive oxygen from the alveolar air . It is important that the flow of venous blood passing through the pulmonary capillaries be equally distributed through the lungs so that all the blood comes in contact with the alveolar air . If this were not the case , some of the blood would pass through the lungs and be pumped back to the tissues with little or no change in gas composition . Assuming that the pulmonary capillary flow is evenly distributed it is also necessary that the amount of blood passing through the lungs per minute is in such relationship to the amount of fresh air reaching the alveoli each minute that adequate gas exchange takes place . If the amount of blood passing through the lungs is correctly balanced with alveolar ventilation , the blood leaving the lungs will carry the correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow and alveolar ventilation increases proportionately , the same will apply . If , however , increased or normal blood flow is in excess of ventilation , the amount of oxygen in the blood and alveoli will decrease , and the amount of carbon dioxide will rise above normal levels . The amount of blood passing through the lungs depends on the requirements of the tissues . During activity of any kind , the tissues produce proportionately more carbon dioxide and need greater amounts of oxygen . In these circumstances , the heart beats faster and the blood circulates more quickly so that a greater volume passes through the lungs each minute . When this occurs , the alveolar ventilation must be increased in order to oxygenate the increased volume of blood . // BLOOD GASES When the oxygen from the air enters the blood , it no longer retains the same form . It combines with the blood in two ways : ( 1 ) it is dissolved in the watery parts of the blood , and ( 2 ) it combines chemically with haemoglobin in the red cells of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain amount of gas . A simple example is in a bottle of aerated water where gas has been compressed into the bottle . As soon as the bottle is opened , the gas in excess of the amount which can be dissolved leaves the surface of the water . The amount of oxygen which can be dissolved in the watery parts of the blood is in direct proportion to the PO2 to which it is exposed ( i.e. alveolar PO2 ) but , no matter how high this rises , breathing ordinary room air , the amount is insignificant in relation to the oxygen requirements of the body . Fortunately , the haemoglobin in the red blood cells is capable of combining chemically with much greater quantities of oxygen than could be dissolved in the same amount of liquid . One gram of haemoglobin can combine chemically with 1.34 c.c. of oxygen . The actual amount of oxygen combined with the haemoglobin depends on the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood . The amount of oxygen taken up by the haemoglobin , however , does not rise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite steeply until the haemoglobin is almost completely saturated , the last part rising somewhat less steeply than at the beginning . If the subject is inactive , this point is reached during quiet breathing of room air . From then on , the partial pressure may rise considerably if ventilation is increased but there will be very little addition of oxygen to the red blood cells because an increase in ventilation after the saturation point is neared will not result in a corresponding rise in oxygen content of the red blood cells . The manner in which oxygen combines with haemoglobin means that the ventilation may fall somewhat below normal without causing a significant reduction in the oxygen content of the blood . The carbon dioxide content of the blood , on the other hand , rises and falls in direct proportion to alterations in alveolar PCO2 . This means that a change in alveolar ventilation will be more directly apparent in the measurement of carbon dioxide than in oxygen content , whether this be a rise or fall . To summarize , ventilation in excess of requirements will cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level ' and will not enable the singer to create an oxygen reserve because , once saturated , the oxygen content of the blood can not be increased significantly . Inadequate ventilation results in reduction of oxygen content and increase of carbon dioxide in the blood , the latter reaching significant proportions before the former . CHEMICAL AND VOLUNTARY REGULATION OF VENTILATION It is important that the gas content of the blood be kept at the correct levels . In the resting state , the amount of air taken into the alveoli is sufficient to supply the oxygen needs of the body and to remove the carbon dioxide which must be given off in a similar quantity . If blood flow increases and alveolar ventilation is inadequate the body has mechanisms which sense this . These are chemically con-trolled centres in the brain that are sensitive to the gas content of the blood which reaches them . If , through inadequate ventilation , the oxygen content of the blood falls and the carbon dioxide content rises , these chemo-receptors will stimulate activity in the respiratory system so that there is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increase in the rate of breathing . If inadequate ventilation is due to voluntary decrease in the rate of breathing ( as in speech ) then the increased ventilation resulting from stimulus from the cerebral centres will be achieved by an increase in the depth of respiration only . These chemo-receptors , while not quite so sensitive to oxygen lack , are extremely sensitive to a rise in carbon dioxide which , as stated above , is more closely indicative of a varia-tion in ventilation . In certain types of activity , even though the ventilation is increased considerably , it may still be insufficient to meet the bodily needs . In this case , certain physiological processes are set in motion which allow bodily processes to continue , but an oxygen debt is created which must be repaid by a continuation of increased breathing after the activity has stopped . After a certain point , the existence of an oxygen debt causes a decrease in the efficiency of muscular contrac-tion . In some cases , the type of activity may make it impossible for ventilation to be increased greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , e.g. in running , a sprinter runs 100 yards without taking a breath , but performance In all races over 400 // yards ( or one minute ) is limited by the capacity of the lungs and heart to transport oxygen and carbon dioxide . The normal ventilation of severe muscular exercise , although very high , does not reach the level of ventilation which is possible when a person voluntarily uses all his breathing reserves . Thus , while it is not possible for the reasons just given to create an oxygen reserve , in some cases it may be possible and desirable consciously to increase ventilation during activity over and above the increase which would result reflexly from the activity . In fact , training in many sports includes the acquiring of certain breathing habits which delay , as far as possible , the building up of a high oxygen debt without hindering the carrying out of the activity . MECHANICS OF BREATHING The factors governing mechanical movement of the thoracic cage are not only muscular . During inspiration , muscular effort enlarges the thorax , causes expansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air at atmospheric pressure flows in . However , this muscular action is opposed by certain forces which may be divided into three components as follows : ( a ) Force to overcome elastic resistance . Elasticity is a property inherent in certain matter that causes it to return to its resting shape after external pressure , tension or distortion . If we take a spring as in Fig. 20 we find that the degree to which it can be stretched varies proportionately to the amount of force used until the elastic limit is reached or exceeded . At the same time , force is needed to compress a spring if the resting position allows of this ( Fig. 19 ) . Some tissues of the lungs and thorax also possess the property of elasticity . Like the springs , these tissues must be stretched during inspiration by an external force ( muscular effort ) and when this muscular force ceases , these tissues recoil to their resting position . The greater the muscular force , the more the tissues are stretched and the greater the volume increase on inspiration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only upon change in distance or volume and is not affected by the speed at which the stretching action is carried out . Fig. 20 shows single elastic systems since in each case there is only one spring or one set of springs . However , the lungs and thorax each possess a different set of springs with the resting levels at different // points . As the lungs and thorax are held together by the pleural surfaces , the combined resting level is at a point where the lung springs are somewhat stretched and the thoracic springs are somewhat compressed . In singing , however , we are only concerned with the combined resting level of the lungs and thorax which is at the end of a normal quiet expiration . This balanced or neutral position is called the resting expiratory level , and the volume of air contained in the lungs at this level is the functional residual capacity . Muscular effort is required to stretch the springs towards inspiration or compress them towards further expiration. ( b ) Force to move non-elastic tissue . Muscular force is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration , such as the rib cage , diaphragm , abdominal contents . Unlike the force required to overcome elastic resistance , it is dependent on velocity of motion and therefore on the rapidity or quickness of breathing , i.e. the greater the speed of the respiratory movement the greater the muscular force . At the beginning of a normal inspiration , when air flow is just beginning , it is at a minimum . It is greatest at the // time of greatest airflow ( even though maximum inspiratory volume has not yet been reached ) . It is zero at the end of inspiration when flow and movement stop , although it is at this point that the muscular force needed to overcome elastic resistance must be the greatest because maximal volume has been reached . End inspiration is , therefore , a result of reduction in muscular effort sufficient to cause no further inspiratory movement , but not so great a reduction as will allow the elastic forces to cause the elastic tissues to recoil towards the resting position . If it is desired to increase the speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased proportionately to the increase in speed . ( c ) Force to overcome resistance to airflow through tracheo-bronchial tree . This also depends on the rate or velocity of the airflow . It also depends on the amount of resistance offered . The mechanical factors involved in expiration are as follows : ( a ) Elastic force . The muscles of inspiration relax and no longer exert a force which distends the lungs and thorax . The stretched elastic tissues of the lungs and thorax now recoil with a force which depends on their end-inspiratory volume and the compliance of the particular lung thorax system . The more the tissues are stretched , i.e. the greater the capacity or volume , the greater is the force of elastic recoil . In normal circumstances , the elastic energy causes the lungs and thorax to return very rapidly to the resting expiratory level without any muscular activity being required . After the resting level is reached , muscular effort is required to compress the springs towards further expiration . Thus the elastic force opposes inspiration from the resting level and assists expiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As explained , at the end of inspiration , the elastic tissues are under stretch and tend to recoil . This elastic or recoil force is available to overcome airway resistance and the non-elastic resistance or friction in the moving tissues which exists during expiration as well as during inspiration and which , again , is greatest at the moment of maximum airflow . If , during expiration , there is any continuation of tension in the inspiratory muscles , this also opposes the expiratory elastic forces . ( c ) Resistance to airflow through tracheo-bronchial tree . As in inspiration , this depends on the resistance offered as well as the rate or velocity of flow . In phonation , resistance is also offered by the coming together of the vocal cords , a factor which will be discussed in detail below . // INTERACTION OF ELASTIC PROPERTIES AND RESPIRATORY MUSCLES The forces moving the lungs and chest wall during breathing may come , then , from three sources : muscles of inspiration , muscles of expiration , or passive elastic forces . The direction , speed and magni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of all these forces , and the activity of the respiratory muscles can only be really understood when studied in relation to these elastic forces . Certain patterns can be observed during quiet and increased breath ing which can be summarized as follows : Inspiration is produced by contraction of the muscles of inspiration opposed by the elastic recoil of the lungs and thorax , the speed and magnitude of the inspiratory movement depending on the extent of the muscular force . In quiet breathing and considerably increased pulmonary ventilation , expiration is produced solely by the elastic recoil of the lungs with no need for activity of the expiratory muscles . When activity does occur , it is late in expiration when the force of elastic recoil is at a minimum . More vigorous contraction of the expiratory muscles occurs in those circumstances where elastic recoil is insufficient to produce the desired expiratory force , i.e. in maximum voluntary expiration and when it is desired to increase the speed of expiration , also in such activities as coughing , straining where the abdominal muscles act in conjunction with contraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRESSURE DURING ORDINARY BREATHING ( UNPHONATED ) 1 Ignoring for the moment the effects of resistance to airflow , the pressure of air in the lungs during ordinary breathing ( unphonated ) depends on the extent of the elastic forces ( which , in turn , depends on the volume of air in the lungs ) and also on the degree of participation of the respiratory muscles . These factors are summarized in the pressure-volume diagram ( Fig. 21 ) after Campbell . If all muscles are relaxed at the end of a maximum inspiration , so that expiration is produced by elastic forces , the pressure in the alveoli at any lung volume during expiration is as shown by the dotted line . Early in expiration when the volume is 1,200 c.c. above the resting or relaxation volume ( F.R.C. ) the pressure is approxi- // mately 1 cm. mercury above atmospheric . When the volume drops to 600 c.c. above the functional residual capacity , the pressure is only ? 5 cm. mercury above atmospheric . At the resting level ( i.e. when the muscles of breathing are inactive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beyond this point , the pressure drops below atmospheric . Thus , the greater the volume , the higher will be the pressure of air in the alveoli as a result of elastic recoil . ( This is obviously brought about because at the beginning of expiration , air pressure is increased by the force of elastic recoil faster than it is de-creased as a result of air escape through the open glottis . As expira-tion proceeds the ratio between these two factors decreases . ) If , however , the activity of the expiratory muscles is consciously intensi-fied at any point , the pressure at any volume will be correspondingly higher . // Expiratory pressures and airflow as well as the action of the respiratory muscles during speech have been the subject of recently published studies by Draper , Ladefoged and Whitteridge . These are summarized briefly in the following extract . During a steady level of loudness of speech , the mean tracheal pressure is kept remarkably steady . The pressures needed varies from 2 cm. of water for very quiet speech to 30 cm. for parade-ground shouting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout an expira tion the inspiratory muscles ? the external intercostals ? at first oppose the relaxation pressure ( there is usually a short period when all muscles are inactive and the relaxation pressure acts alone ) ; then expiratory muscles , beginning with the internal intercostals and later involving other muscles , such as the rectus abdominis , reinforce the diminishing relaxation pressure . ' 1 93 VI Control of the Breathing Mechanism The next step in gaining an understanding of the vocal mechanism is to know as clearly as possible the full extent of voluntary control that is possible over the movements of respiration . Considerable voluntary control , of course , exists in that the rate and depth can be altered at will and breathing can be arrested for a limited time . At the same time the muscular forces affecting the movements of inspiration and expiration can be distributed in various ways to produce different patterns . These variations have been observed by Duomarco , Rimini and Recarte , 1944 , who interpreted intra-abdominal pressure in terms of three mechanisms ( 1 ) action of the diaphragm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 3 ) action of the abdominal muscles . Campbells has reversed normal patterns of abdominal pressure by deliberate altera-tion of normal breathing patterns . Different movements can also be observed in the external appear-ance of the thorax and abdomen during inspiration in different individuals who are breathing naturally and without any attempt at conscious control of their breathing pattern . However , all these patterns of expansion can be produced at will when voluntary control is exercised . In all cases , the exact muscular patterns underlying these differences of external movement of the thorax can not , on present evidence , be absolutely defined . In describing these patterns , there-fore , we can only do so in terms of the outward appearance and the mental concepts producing such patterns . For example a certain pattern may be obtained by the individual trying to direct tension to the diaphragm or other muscles which in fact may or may not be affected in the way he imagines . Also , when a singer takes in a breath in which protrusion of the abdominal wall is more evident , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not necessarily -r ?  --  r-  --  - // be selectively using the intercostal muscles in one case and the diaphragm in the other . In fact , it is possible that the actual movement of the diaphragm be the same in both cases while the difference in movement may be brought about by other accessory muscles . However , each different pattern affects the singing tone similarly in different individuals and we give below a description of the basic patterns that can be obtained . INSPIRATION The pattern of inspiration is determined by the extent to which the individual consciously or unconsciously ( a ) expands the upper chest ; ( b ) raises the lower ribs ; ( c ) causes descent of the diaphragm , and ( d ) tenses the abdominal muscles . Natural , uncontrolled breathing depends on the above factors but may vary with different individuals . When breathing is consciously produced , one or more of the above factors may be intensified in varying degrees . These factors will now be discussed separately in so far as their merits in singing are concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In normal quiet breathing , there is very little movement of the upper chest , expansion taking place mainly in the lower chest ; some individuals obtain this expansion more by descent of the diaphragm and others more by raising of the lower ribs . When the depth of breathing is voluntarily increased but without conscious thought as to the particular pattern of expansion , the inspiratory effort is usually concentrated on increasing the capacity of the upper chest , i.e. on raising the upper ribs . The total amount of air that can be inspired in this way is very limited , even though a great deal of muscular effort may be employed , as these ribs have a very small range of movement and affect only a small area of the lungs . Much of the apparent expansion is produced by extension of spine and shoulder . Furthermore , if attempts are made to exploit this area of expansion to the full the amount of air which can be inspired is reduced rather than increased as the muscles of the lower chest are inhibited and the efficiency of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will be explained below , the singer needs to take in a great deal of breath and this can not be provided by expansion of the upper chest alone . An even more important reason against excessive raising of the upper ribs is that the muscles which achieve this object can also interfere // with the working of the larynx and with the resonation of the tone . One further objection to the sole use of upper chest breathing is that if this method of inspiration is adopted , there can be no effective control over the expiratory phase . In upper chest breathing , no antagonistic forces are present and descent of the upper rib cage is brought about fundamentally by relaxation of the muscles which raise it . In lower chest breathing , on the other hand , it is possible to set up a balanced set of antagonistic forces which provides a variable adjustment of expiration much more delicate than the simple relaxatory collapse of the thorax and there is much greater control over intra-thoracic pressures . These antagonistic forces also affect movements of the larynx which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall see , demands the existence of antagonism to the abdominal muscles . Without such antagonism the laryngeal mechanism is operated in quite a different manner from that which produces best tone , while powerful tones , particularly , can only be produced by methods which are injurious to the larynx . The remaining factors in inspiration ? diaphragm , lower ribs and abdominal muscles ? can not be considered separately as they each affect the others . If , for instance , the lower ribs are raised by contraction of the intercostal muscles , the circumference of the diaphragm moves . Contraction of the muscular fibres of the diaphragm can affect the movement of the ribs , the nature of this movement depending on the degree of activity in the abdominal muscles as well as the degree of activity in the intercostal muscles . The diaphragm and the muscles responsible for raising the lower ribs are antagonistic to the expiratory abdominal muscles . If activity of the abdominal muscles is greater than the inspiratory forces , then the movement will be one of expiration . If , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles during inspiration results in alteration of the pattern of expansion . ( b ) Raising of the lower ribs . If inspiratory effort is concentrated on trying to raise the lower ribs , the lower chest expands to some extent and , of course , the circumference of the diaphragm follows the movement of the ribs . If , however , no attempt is made to tense the diaphragm , the movement of the ribs is rather limited . ( c ) Descent of the diaphragm . If inspiratory effort is concentrated on trying to depress the diaphragm , there is marked protrusion of the abdominal wall and little raising of the lower ribs . Expansion of the lower chest takes place in a rather more vertical direction . ( d ) Abdominal muscles . Voluntary control of the individual ab- // dominal muscles is not possible , ' except perhaps indirectly , and the singer can only conceive of tensing the abdominal muscles as one co-ordinated group . When he does so , however , there may be varia-tions in the individual muscle tensions due to conceptions which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles , e.g. if the ribs are held extended , the tension among the various abdomi-nal muscles may be distributed differently than if the ribs were allowed to descend . Thus there is a possibility that the transversus can maintain abdominal pressure and provide a check to the descent of the diaphragm without interfering too much with the ribs , because its lines of force are not directed downwards from the ribs . Further , when one tries to tense the abdominal muscles , one may be adding tension to other muscles besides . If , during the inspiratory effort , the singer tries to increase tension on the abdominal muscles , the pattern of inspiration changes so that there is greater lateral expansion of the lower chest and less increase in a vertical direction . The movement of the diaphragm is felt much higher ? between the tip of the breast bone and the navel . Maximum lateral expansion of the lower chest is , in fact , accompanied by reces-sion of the abdominal wall . In inspiration , the lower chest can be expanded to the full in so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other parts of the vocal mechan-ism , as can excessive expansion of the upper chest . The method of inspiration which provides adequate increase of thoracic capacity , without causing any interference with other aspects of voice production , is thus a combination of all four factors , namely expansion of the lower chest by simultaneous efforts to ( a ) raise the lower ribs , ( b ) depress the diaphragm , and ( c ) tense the abdominal muscles ; and expansion of the upper chest by raising of the upper ribs naturally and without force ( more as a result of good posture and less as a result of conscious muscular effort ) . Exercise on these lines makes it possible to increase the flexibility of the lower rib cage so that the capacity of the lower chest can be further increased to a very considerable extent . Whereas , if inspira-tory effort is concentrated on descent of the diaphragm , no great increase of capacity can be obtained by exercise attempting to in-crease the extent of this movement . Once a full breath has been taken in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing except for a slight , scarcely noticeable rise and fall that occurs when the breath is expelled through ascent of the diaphragm and descent of the lower ribs . This enables a fresh breath to be taken in more or less unnoticeably and in the shortest possible time . If the upper chest is allowed to fall , the amount of extra breath available is very small and can not be effectively controlled , while a distinct disadvantage is the resultant loss of time and useless expendi ture of energy at the next inspiration . The upper chest is elevated not so much for the air contained in it as for the fact that its elevation is necessary to enable the lower chest to expand to its maximum . This it can not do if the upper chest is quite relaxed because of the way the two mechanisms are con nected . The upper chest mechanism in a sense forms a pivot for the movement of the lower chest . If the upper chest is not raised , the pivot from which the lower ribs can expand is much lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of upper chest movement may result in considerable restriction of lower chest expansion ( Fig. 22 ) . This also provides an important reason for increasing the size of the upper chest . Much is often made of the fact that well-known singers do not look as if they are taking in much breath , and pupils are often told that it is unnecessary and even harmful to take in deep breaths . This shows complete misunderstanding of the vocal mechanism . Deep breaths are only harmful if they are obtained by excessive raising of the upper chest and if the singer is unable to control these deep breaths cor rectly . If the upper chest is raised correctly as explained above and not allowed to fall , it is possible to take in very deep breaths by ex pansion of the lower chest without a great deal of noticeable move ment taking place , as movement of the upper chest is always more // obvious than that of the lower chest . As the measurements of the upper chest increases as a result of developing exercises , expansion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under cover ' of the increased framework of the upper chest . So we find that the greater the physical stature of the singer and the more breath he is able to take in , the less noticeable his breathing becomes . Distribution of Muscular Tension on Completion of Inspiration One further factor in inspiration remains to be discussed ? the question of the distribution of muscular tension on completion of inspiration . This varies according to the method of inspiration em ployed . For example , if the upper chest only is used , there is scarcely any tension on the abdominal muscles or diaphragm at the end of inspiration . If the inspiratory effort is concentrated on the diaphragm , there will be little tension on the abdominal muscles and what there is will be rather differently distributed from that which occurs when inspiration is produced by greater activity of the abdominal muscles . If inspiration is produced by tension of the inspiratory muscles only , then expiration is mainly a result of relaxation of these muscles . If inspiration is produced , as recommended above , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force resulting from contraction of the abdominal muscles , then at the end of inspiration , instead of there being one group of muscles tensed and the other relaxed , both groups will be under tension in balanced antagonism . ) In this case , it will be possible to increase tension on both sets of muscles with no actual movement taking place , just as when one holds the palms of one 's hands together one may increase the muscular force directed at moving the hands towards each other , without any actual movement taking place . The above analogy is not absolutely accurate because the abdomi nal contents are situated between the diaphragm and the abdominal muscles , so it would seem that simultaneous increase of tension on the diaphragm and abdominal muscles would tend to increase intra abdominal pressure unless other factors prevent this . Excessive pres sures developed by straining can cause a fall of blood pressure and fainting and , if the subject has been overbreathing ( see page 87 ) , the effects combine . Duomarco and Rimini suggest that the upward and outward movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abdomen more than descent of the diaphragm reduces My own experience has shown that it is possible , whilst singing , to make great efforts to increase tensions simultaneously on the abdominal muscles and the diaphragm without any untoward physical effects . This is probably because , unlike in straining , efforts are being made to keep the ribs raised which , according to Duomarco and Rimini , help to reduce abdominal pressure . If inspiration is produced by a method in which the abdominal muscles are not consciously employed , attempts to tense them on completion of inspiration and during expiration are not as effective as if they had been tensed during inspiration . Both method and extent of inspiration , therefore , are determined not only by breath volume requirements for the phrase but also by the distribution of muscular forces needed for correct vocal production during the expiratory phase . In fact , it is an even more important factor because it affects the tone continuously and not only at the end of phrases when the breath capacity is diminished . EXPIRATION The same muscular forces are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an opposite direction ; whereas in inspiration the elastic forces oppose muscular effort , in expiration they are of assistance . There do not appear to have been any studies of attempts to voluntarily control the nature of expiration similar to those des cribed during inspiration on page 94 . However , there would appear to be no reason why the inspiratory muscles can not be used to affect the pattern of expiration just as the abdominal muscles can affect the pattern of inspiration , and why the pattern of expiration can not also be controlled by varying the tension ratio between the two major muscle groups of inspiration in relation to abdominal tension . Variations in the ratio of activity in these muscle groups have been noted in ordinary speech by Draper , Ladefoged and Whitteridge and I have found that much better results are obtained in singing by a student who thinks of his respiratory mechanism ( both inspiratory and expiratory ) in terms of a ratio between these three major muscle groups than by a student who thinks in terms of only two , i.e. inspiratory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of tension relationships affecting pressure and volume . During inspiration , singers are only concerned with taking in cor- // rectly the necessary amount of breath in the shortest possible time . Understanding of the expiratory phase , however , is much more complex as delicate control is required over breath volume and breath pressure for every note . It is therefore necessary to know how both breath volume and breath pressure are affected by these three tension concepts . In this section we shall deal only with the way in which the singer can control breath volume , i.e. the reduction of thoracic capacity . As in inspiration , we must think of the abdominal muscles as being in antagonism to two separate forces ( diaphragm and intercostal muscles ) which may be used either separately or together . All movements can be conceived as being the result of a mental concept of a particular ratio of tension between these forces . Normally , a greater flow of breath is obtained by relaxation of the inspiratory muscles , so that expiration is produced mainly by elastic recoil of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity of the abdominal muscles . If such relaxation occurs during singing , however , it is impossible to produce powerful tones which , as we shall see , are produced only when the tension on the abdominal muscles is greatly increased . The maximum degree of tension which may be placed on the abdominal muscles when the inspiratory muscles are relaxed is not very high . This is because the lower ribs form the upper attachments of the abdominal muscles . If the ribs are allowed to descend rapidly during expiration , the point of fixation of the abdominal muscles moves . As a result , the abdominal muscles are rapidly shortened , making it impossible to maintain a high degree of tension . If tension on the abdominal muscles is to be increased considerably , then the ribs must be held fixed against this abdominal pull . If effort is being made to hold the ribs extended , then any attempt to increase tension on the abdominal muscles is automatically accompanied by an increase of tension on the rib-holding muscles so that equilibrium is maintained , the downward pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ribs . In this case , increase of tension on the abdominal muscles does not increase breath flow . Indeed thoracic movement may virtually stop although tension on the abdominal muscles continues to increase . If breath flow is to be increased without reducing the tension on the abdominal muscles , and without destroying the equilibrium between the abdominal muscles and the ribs , this can be achieved by relaxation of the diaphragm . As explained above ( page 74 ) contraction of the diaphragm results in ascent of the ribs as well as descent of the // central tendon . Thus , if the diaphragm is allowed to relax , the ribs must descend . However , if the ribs descend as a result of the inward pull of the diaphragm rather than as a result of relaxation of the intercostal muscles , then they remain more firmly held against the pull of the abdominal muscles . In practice , if the singer thinks in terms of holding the lower ribs extended as he varies abdominal tension , they will hold against these tensions without any necessity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the singer thinks in terms of keeping the lower ribs extended , he then only has two muscle groups to control consciously ? abdominal muscles and diaphragm . If he establishes this hold ' on the lower ribs , he then has very delicate control over the diaphragm and abdominal muscles and can vary their respective tensions to a fine degree . If , however , he tries directly to lessen the tension in the intercostal muscles or thinks in terms of regulating the speed of the descent of the ribs by gradual relaxation of the rib muscles , he tends to relax and lose control over the abdominal muscles and he is unable to maintain the same delicate control over breath volume as he can when the descent of the ribs is brought about more indirectly by concentrating on relaxation of the diaphragm . It should be realized that if effort is made to hold the ribs extended and to tense the abdominal muscles , the natural tendency is to tense the diaphragm as well . In these circumstances , the greater the abdominal tension , the less breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath volume is required at the same time as high abdominal tension is needed , then the singer must learn to control this natural tendency to increase tensions generally , and learn to increase or decrease tension on the diaphragm while he is maintaining the same tension on the intercostal muscles and abdominal muscles . In fact , the acquiring of breath control in singing is no more or less than acquiring the ability to control these tensions independently instead of allowing the natural co-ordinations to take place . An unskilled singer tends to increase tension or decrease tension simultaneously on all muscles while a well-trained one has a much greater independent control . The greater the tensions used , the more difficult this independent control becomes ; but it must be acquired if the singer is to be able to produce the required tones . Briefly then , if the singer wishes to have fullest control over the tension of the abdominal muscles as well as fine control over breath volume , he must first set ' the ribs and then think only of controlling the abdominal muscles and diaphragm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abdominal tension , he decreases tension on the diaphragm ; to use less breath , he increases tension on the diaphragm . In some cases , the volume of breath passing through the vocal cords will be sufficient even when the singer is placing as much tension on the diaphragm as he is capable of . In other cases , he will have to use careful control in order to increase the breath flow at the same time as abdominal and inspiratory intercostal muscles remain tense . The greater the expansion of the thorax , the more easily breath tends to flow as the force of elastic recoil is greater . The greater the strength of the abdominal muscles and the greater the tension placed on them , the less easily the breath tends to flow as the tension on the antagonistic inspiratory muscles increases in proportion . Latissimus Dorsi When an additional expiratory force is required without relaxing those inspiratory muscles which are antagonistic to the abdominal muscles , the latissimus dorsi can be brought into tension ( see page 81 ) . 103 VII The Laryngeal Mechanism As can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to the arytenoid cartilages at one end and the thyroid cartilage at the other . These cartilages are controlled by the arytenoid muscles and the PCA ? posterior crico-arytenoid LCA ? lateral crico-arytenoid CT ? crico-thyroid // crico-thyroid muscles respectively . There are also muscles inside the vocal cords themselves called the thyro-arytenoid muscles . These three sets of muscles make up the intrinsic muscles of the larynx and are primarily responsible for the working of the vocal cords when production is correct . Crico-thyroid Muscles When the crico-thyroid muscles tense , they tilt the thyroid cartilage and the cricoid cartilage in such a way as to stretch and lengthen the vocal cords . Arytenoid Muscles The action of the trans-arytenoid muscle , when it tenses , is to draw the arytenoid cartilages together thus helping to close the posterior portion of the glottis . When the lateral crico-arytenoid muscles tense , they draw the outer end of the arytenoid cartilage downwards and out in such a way as to also adduct the vocal cords ( Fig. 29 ) . The posterior crico-arytenoid muscles , when they tense , draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocal cords ( Fig. 28 ) . This muscle is the only abductor of the vocal cords as a whole . The posterior crico-arytenoid muscles and the lateral cricoarytenoid muscles are antagonistic to each other but , working together , they draw the arytenoid cartilages towards the cricoid cartilage . // The arytenoid group as a whole act antagonistically to the cricothyroid muscles and , when working properly , hold the arytenoid cartilages against the pull of the crico-thyroid muscles . If the arytenoid muscles were too weak they would not be able to hold , but when the crico-thyroid muscles tensed to stretch the vocal cords , they would give ' thus reducing the efficiency of the stretching action of the crico-thyroid muscles . Thyro-arytenoid Muscles The thyro-arytenoid muscles lie within the vocal cords and are very complex . Acting as a whole , they would seem to draw forward the arytenoid cartilages , thus relaxing the vocal cords . However , they can also tense and adduct a posterior section of the vocal cords and leave only a relaxed , anterior portion free to vibrate . They can vary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 30 ) . The efficiency of these actions is dependent on the crico- and transarytenoid muscles and crico-thyroid muscles working properly . If the arytenoid group or the crico-thyroid muscles are not sufficiently developed , the arytenoid group may give ' or the crico-thyroid muscles may not contract sufficiently and the vocal cords may not be sufficiently stretched . The thyro-arytenoid muscles within the cords then have to take up too much tension in an endeavour to hold the pitch , and when they can no longer hold the tension , the singer 's range will be curtailed or , in the case of a male voice , he will have to resort to falsetto ; there may be faulty intonation . // The correct action of these muscles in singing is also dependent on the correct working of the extrinsic muscles of the larynx . In fact what is usually ascribed to weakness of the larynx is more likely to be misuse of these extrinsic muscles which are attached to the larynx but which lie outside it . As these muscles also control the shape of the resonators they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extrinsic muscles has an important effect on the working of the intrinsic muscles of the larynx and much greater harm can come to the vocal cords as a result of misuse of these muscles than from incorrect breathing or any other factor in the production of the voice . It is misuse of these muscles which is responsible for the formation of nodules and eventual deterioration of the voice . ACTION OF THE LARYNX IN RELATION TO PITCH In other stringed instruments , the ratio between mass , length and tension for any pitch is pre-determined by the makers of the instrument ; it is constant and can not be altered . In the voice , however , this ratio can be altered at will by the use of the breath to produce a greater variety of tones . Herein lies the main difference between the voice and other stringed instruments . It is a most important difference , one which endows the vocal instrument with a greater potential of effectiveness but also one which , if not understood , is a source of danger to the singer . No matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little harm can come to the instrument because the ratio chosen by the makers is one which will withstand any strain to which it is likely to be subjected during use , and this ratio can not be tampered with . If the laryngeal mechanism is not understood , however , a ratio can be chosen which will impose too great a strain on the muscles involved , resulting in limitation of the potential of the voice and its eventual deterioration . In fact , we may say that knowledge of these ratios is one of the most important keys to voice production . It is a question which must be thoroughly understood by the teacher if the potential of the voice is to be fully developed and the health of the vocal mechanism preserved . Pressman has demonstrated the following changes that occur in the appearance of the vocal cords while singing up the scale but points out that these changes are almost always gradual ? not sudden as many writers imply . In the production of the lower notes , the glottis is open widest in its posterior part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the // laryngeal muscles are under the least tension on these notes . As the pitch rises , the crico-thyroid muscles tense so that the vocal cords gradually lengthen and grow thinner . At the same time , the transarytenoid muscle and crico-arytenoid muscles take up added tension in such a way as to gradually draw the vocal cords closer together so that the glottis gradually narrows until , in the middle notes , the opening is usually linear in shape . As this process continues , the tension on the vocal cords increases until a certain point when the tension becomes too great and further elevation in pitch is achieved in a manner similar to fingering a violin string on the finger-board , i.e. the posterior sections of the vocal cords are tightly adducted and the length of vocal cord left free to vibrate is shortened . This is achieved mainly by the action of the thyro-arytenoid muscles within the vocal cords themselves . At the commencement of the third aspect only the posterior tip of the cords is approximated , thus leaving relatively long vibrating segments anteriorly . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the approximated posterior section be- // comes longer and longer and the vibrating portion correspondingly shorter . The changes in tension of the vocal cords have not been clearly demonstrated although it is usually assumed that this increases as the pitch is raised as a result of the lengthening and consequent stretching of the vocal cords . The fact that shortening of the vocal cords takes place on the higher pitches tends to confirm this assumption as it is a phenomenon which only becomes necessary when tension becomes excessive . Thus the general pattern of change as far as pitch is concerned conforms with the laws of vibrating strings except that the vocal cords grow longer from the lower to the middle tones instead of shorter . However , this is compensated for by the fact that they also become thinner which tends to raise pitch and one must assume that any further adjustment necessary is brought about by the increased tension which probably accompanies the lengthening of the vocal cords . When considering the above , it must be remembered that the pitch at which one aspect of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nature of the sound produced ( see page 109 ) . If , whilst singing , the mental concept of pitch is altered the vocal cords undergo changes in mass , length and tension as above , according to the breath pressure being employed at the time . Similarly , if the breathing ratio is altered while singing the same note , the vocal cords will undergo changes in mass , length and tension according to the rules in Chapter III . That these complex changes occur is indicated by the observations of J. J. Pressman who has shown that the length of the vibrating section of the vocal cords can vary for a note of exactly the same pitch if the tension on the breathing muscles is altered . Pressman says : Extra pressure tends to elevate pitch . If the pitch is to be maintained constant in the face of added pressure , some compensatory change in the configuration of the vocal cords must take place to lower pitch in the same degree that increase in pressure tends to elevate it . Thus the cords would , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under these circumstances , if the pitch is to be maintained but volume increased by extra expiratory pressure , such increase in volume is accompanied not only by wider movement of the cords but also by changes to a pattern of vocal cord position characteristic of a relatively lower pitch . ' // 112 THE LARYNGEAL MECHANISM These observations discount the theories of many writers who base their teaching on the assumption that certain changes always take place on the same notes of the scale . The experiments that would seem to prove this assumption , however , give no analysis of the tones produced and it is more than probable that in all cases , the breath pressures used were similar . It should be noted that as the pitch rises , the glottis not only changes its shape but the opening becomes smaller and smaller . 113 VIII The Resonators The cavities which must be considered in our study of the resonation of the voice may be divided into three groups as follows : 1 . The mouth . 2 . The throat ( comprising the laryngeal pharynx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nasal cavities and sinuses of the head . Alterations in the size and shape of any of the adjustable cavities may affect the size and shape of the adjacent cavities and their respective openings , e.g. alterations in the position of the base of the tongue affect the size and shape of both the throat and mouth cavities ; movement of the jaw may affect the mouth cavity alone or it may affect both the mouth and throat cavities ; raising or lowering of the soft palate involves changes in all cavities in these three groups . Furthermore , although the non-adjustable cavities can not be altered in shape , differences in the shape of the adjustable cavities result in differences in the degree of stimulation received by the non-adjustable cavities . Thus , in order to understand the actions of the vocal resonators , it is necessary to visualize the actions not of individual muscles or individual cavities , but to visualize the actions of several muscles acting simultaneously and making changes in two or maybe more cavities at the same time . Before going further , a word about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been grouped together because we can not control either of these separately ; anatomically they may be divided into two , but for purposes of control they can only be thought of as one . In the third group , only the entrance to the naso-pharynx is adjustable ; the other cavities are connected to it and may be affected only indirectly by alterations in the entrance to the naso-pharynx. // THE SINUSES AND NASAL CAVITIES The post-nasal cavities , the cavities behind the nose , open at the back through the post-nasal apertures into the naso-pharynx . They are long and high in shape but very narrow where they are most bony , and much of their internal space is taken up by the conchae , soft tissue which is not very resonant . They are connected by air channels with the sinuses or hollows in the frontal bones of the head . The largest and most important of the sinuses are the maxillary sinuses situated on either side of the nose , below the sockets of the eyes and above the upper molar and wisdom teeth . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which forms their floor , and are connected with the nasal cavities by air channels which run from their upper portions into the nose . The other sinuses are the ethmoidal , sphenoidal and frontal . These // are also connected by air channels with the nasal cavities . The largest of them are the frontal sinuses , situated in the brow , on either side of the top of the nose . THE MOUTH The mouth is bounded externally by the lips and cheeks and is roofed in by the palate . Within it lie the teeth and the greater part of the tongue . The palate is divided into two portions , namely the hard and soft palates . The hard palate has a bony foundation and represents the anterior two-thirds of the whole . It arches backwards from the upper teeth and forms a division between the mouth and nasal cavities . The soft palate has a fibro-muscular basis and represents the pos terior third . The superior surface of the soft palate continues the floor of the nasal cavities backwards and downwards and forms the floor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mouth . The hinder part of the soft palate is freely mobile , moving like a door on its hinge near its junction with the hard palate . It forms an arch which is interrupted in the middle by a conical projection called the uvula . The soft palate extends backwards into the cavity of the pharynx , forming a partial division between the oral and nasal parts of the pharynx . On each side , the soft palate is connected with two folds of mucu ous membrane , extending downwards and forming a double arch , // known as the palatine arches . They are separated on each side by a triangular interval occupied by the tonsil . The front folds ? the palato-glossal arches ? descend to the dorsum and sides of the tongue . The posterior folds ? the palato-pharyngeal arches ? descend from the posterior edges of the soft palate and are lost on the side walls of the pharynx . The uvula and , if the tonsils have been removed , both palatine arches can be clearly observed through the open mouth . The aperture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pharynx is known as the oro-pharyngeal isthmus . It is bounded at the sides by the palato-glossal arches , above by the in ferior surface of the soft palate , and below by the upper surface ( dorsum ) of the tongue . Closure of the oro-pharyngeal isthmus is effected ( a ) by elevation of the posterior part of the dorsum of the tongue against the soft palate , ( b ) slight lowering of the soft palate and ( c ) by movement inwards of the palato-glossal folds . The muscles which bring about these various movements are the palato-glossal muscles lying within the palato-glossal arches , and the muscles concerned in elevation of the tongue . Wider opening of the oro-pharyngeal isthmus may be brought about ( a ) by depressing the base of the tongue and/or by raising of the soft palate . The size and shape of the front aperture of the mouth ? the oral fissure ? depends on the distance between the teeth and the shape of the lips . The shape of the mouth cavity also depends on the shape and position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the factors affecting the shape and size of the mouth cavity are ( a ) the distance between the teeth , ( b ) the shape of the lips , the size of the oro-pharyngeal isthmus and ( d ) the shape and position of the front part of the tongue . PHARYNX Structurally , the pharynx is a fibro-muscular bag lined with mucu ous membrane and is of conical form ? wide above and narrow below . It lies behind and communicates with the nasal cavities , the mouth and the larynx , and is continuous below with the oesophagus or gullet . The fibrous wall of the pharynx is firmly fixed above to the base of the cranium , but is not otherwise attached except to the hyoid bone and the skeleton of the larynx . The muscular wall of the pharynx is composed of two strata . The // external or circular layer consists of a series of three overlapping muscles ? the constrictor muscles of the pharynx which , by their contractions in swallowing , force the food down into the oesophagus ? their constriction at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . The internal or longitudinal layer consists of two accessory muscles which blend with the wall but are also attached to the larynx , namely the fibres of the palato pharyngeus and stylo pharyngeus muscles . The former arises in the soft palate and joins the pharyngeal wall through the palato-pharyngeal arch , after which it is joined by the salpingo-pharyngeus and descends downwards alongside the stylo-pharyngeus to the larynx . The latter runs from the styloid process ( a projection on the skull close to the joint of the jaw bone ) to the larynx , entering and blending with the wall of the pharynx in the interval between the superior and middle constrictor muscles . THE RESONATORS In the middle part of the pharynx , the pathway for respired air between the nose and the larynx crosses that of food and drink from the mouth to the oesophagus . The inferior portion below the opening of the larynx is exclusively a part of the alimentary tract , and the portion above the level of the soft palate ( naso-pharynx ) is used for respiration only . In our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a ) the naso-pharynx , and ( b ) the throat ? comprising both the laryngeal pharynx and the oral pharynx . The reason for this division into two sections is that we have separate voluntary control of the naso pharynx and of the throat as a whole . We can not voluntarily control the laryngeal pharynx independently of the oral pharynx . The naso-pharynx is the highest part of the pharynx , situated behind the nasal cavities . It communicates with the nasal cavities through a pair of large fixed openings in its anterior wall . It differs from the rest of the pharynx in that its cavity is , under all conditions , an open chamber incapable of obliteration , since all its walls , with the single exception of the floor ( soft palate ) are immovable . The nasal pharynx communicates with the oral part of the pharynx through a passage bounded by the free , posterior margin of the soft palate and the back wall of the pharynx . This aperture is known as the pharyngeal isthmus and its closure is effected by raising the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes into contact with the posterior wall of the pharynx . The muscle responsible for raising of the soft palate and separation of the oral part from the nasal part is the levator palati , a muscle originating at the base of the cranium . The muscles which pull the palate away from the posterior wall of the pharynx are the palato-pharyngeus and the palato-glossus ( both in the palatine arches ) , and the tensor palatii which is antagonistic to the levator palati . Although it is a portion of the true pharynx , the nano-pharynx is functionally a part of the respiratory tract . Thus , the pharyngeal isthmus remains open during the act of breathing , and is closed during the act of swallowing in order to prevent the introduction of food and liquid into the nasal cavity . During speech , the pharyngeal isthmus may be closed for all sounds except for the consonants m , n , and ng , which require nasal resonance for their correct pronunciation . Russell ' shows in his X-ray experiments that in speech , the use of the nasal opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vowels and not for others , while other subjects show either a closed passage or an open passage for all vowels . He states that the uvula may be raised or lowered by many individuals and that this seems to be especially true of professional singers who have trained themselves to pull it up out of the way , also of certain girls or even women , and of some Italians , Spaniards , and other Romance-language speaking peoples whose lan guage requires the production of ringing or bright qualities in some vowels , etc . Where the uvula and soft palate is raised , both they and the pala tine arches become more tensed and present a taut , harder surface . When the uvula and soft palate hang down , their surfaces and those of the palatine arches become softer . The effect of these differences in surface quality on the tone will be discussed later . THROAT ( laryngeal pharynx and oral pharynx ) The oral pharynx lies behind the mouth , between the soft palate aboveand the inlet of the larynx below . Its posterior boundary is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no distinguishing feature . It communicates above with the nasal pharynx through the pharyn-geal isthmus . Anteriorly , it is bounded by the pharyngeal surface of the tongue , above which it communicates with the mouth through the oro-pharyngeal isthmus . Each side wall is a triangular area , bounded by the palatine arches , and named the tonsillar sinus as it is occupied by the tonsil . The laryngeal pharynx is behind the larynx . It is wide above , but at the level of the cricoid cartilage it narrows rapidly as it passes down to the join the oesophagus . Its anterior wall is formed through-out by the larynx . Movements of the larynx as it rises for high notes and is pulled down for low notes , therefore , affects the shape of the throat cavity . It is the movements of the tongue , however , which play the major part in altering the size and shape of the throat cavity . In its normal resting position the back part of the tongue lies quite close to the back wall of the pharynx and almost closes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the oro-pharyngeal isthmus when the base of the tongue is drawn forwards can be seen in Fig. 41 . In its normal resting position , the walls of the throat are relatively undamped . When the throat is opened , the palatine arches become more tense and the surface tension of the pharyngeal walls increases ; the surfaces become harder and the degree of damping is reduced . ' If the throat is constricted , the palatine arches and the pharyngeal surfaces become bunched up , soft and flabby ; the degree of damping is increased . THE TONGUE The tongue is a mass of interlacing bundles of muscle mingled with fat and entirely enclosed in mucuous membrane , except the posterior half of the lower part attached to the floor of the mouth , which is called the root , and through which the extrinsic muscles , the blood vessels and the nerves gain entrance to the tongue . The dorsum or upper surface of the tongue can be divided into ( 1 ) a palatine part which looks upwards and is the surface seen in the open mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backwards into the cavity of the pharynx and forms part of its anterior wall . // The intrinsic muscles within the tongue , details of which need not concern us here , alter the shape of the tongue . The extrinsic muscles , arising outside the tongue ( from the lower jaw bone , the hyoid bone and the styloid process ) alter the shape and also produce changes in its position . They may be divided into two groups as follows : ( a ) Elevators of the tongue ? stylo-glossus and palato-glossus . Both these muscles arise from origins above the tongue . The palato-glossus descends from the soft palate , through the palato-glossal arches , to be inserted into the dorsum and sides of the tongue . The stylo-glossus descends from the styloid process ( near the joint of the jaw bone ) , sweeps forwards on each side of the pharynx , and is inserted into the sides of the tongue , its fibres spreading out to mingle with those of the palato-glossus and hyo-glossus. ( b ) Depressors of the tongue genio-glossus and hyo-glossus . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base of the tongue . The hyo-glossus arises from the hyoid bone and is directed upwards and forwards to be inserted into the side of the tongue , its fibres interlacing with the fibres of the stylo-glossus and intrinsic muscles of the tongue . The genio-glossus arises from the inner tip of the lower jaw bone and radiates into the tongue , the posterior ( lowest ) fibres directed downwards and backwards to be inserted into the body of the hyoid bone , the anterior ( intermediate and highest ) fibres curving forwards to the tip of the tongue and radiating to the substance of the tongue in its whole length . Actions . The posterior fibres of the genio-glossus draw the hyoid bone upwards and forwards towards the point of the chin and are active in protrusion of the tongue . The tongue is retracted by the anterior fibres of the genio-glossus aided by the hyo-glossus ( both these muscles serve to draw the palatine part of the tongue towards the hyoid bone ) and the styloglossus . The stylo-glossus and palato-glossus serve to draw the tongue up and back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hyoid bone , in the same direction providing there is no opposing tension . The position of the tongue is dependent on the position of the hyoid bone at its base . This is determined partly by the extrinsic muscles of the tongue and partly by the muscles from the hyoid bone to other parts of the head and neck as described below . // MUSCLES OF THE NECK Apart from the muscles of the vertebral column and the muscles of the tongue and pharynx already described , the muscles which lie wholly or chiefly in the neck are the sterno-mastoid and the muscles of the hyoid bone . The sterno-mastoid muscle lies obliquely in the side of the neck and stands out prominently when thrown into action . It arises from the breast bone and collar bone and is inserted into the mastoid bone . When in tension , it presses against the larynx , thereby providing a most efficient conduction of sound to the inner ear . The greater the tension on these muscles , the more efficiently they will act as conductors of sound directly to the ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The muscles of the hyoid bone may be divided into two antagonistic groups ? the supra-hyoid and the infra-hyoid . Supra-hyoid Muscles ( 1 ) Muscles from the hyoid bone to tongue genio-glossus and hyoglossus . These muscles have already been described above . The genio-glossus when in tension , pulls the hyoid bone upwards and forwards . ( 2 ) Muscles from hyoid bone to chin genio-hyoid and mylo-hyoid . The mylo-hyoid muscles are a layer connecting the hyoid bone to the lower jaw round about , forming a diaphragm in the floor of the mouth . The genio-hyoid muscles , just above the mylo-hyoid muscles and near the middle , connect the hyoid bone to the point of the jaw . Like the genio-glossus to which it is parallel , it draws the hyoid bone upwards and forwards . One can feel their tension if the thumbs are pressed under the chin and ee ' is pronounced . This can be compared with pronunciation of ' ah ' , when their relaxation is noticeable . ( 3 ) Muscles from hyoid bone to chin and cranium ? digastric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower jaw , partly to a loop on the side of the hyoid and partly through it to the mastoid bone at the side of the cranium . ( 4 ) Muscles from hyoid bone to cranium ? stylo-hyoid . The stylohyoid muscle connects the front side of the hyoid bone directly to the styloid process . // Infra-hyoid Muscles ( 5 ) Muscles from hyoid bone to skeleton ? sterno-hyoid and omo-hyoid . The sterno-hyoid muscles connect the hyoid bone to the breast bone , while the omo-hyoid muscles connect the hyoid bone to the collar bone and shoulder blade . They function to lower the hyoid bone and drop the whole larynx , thus elongating the pharynx. ( 6 ) Muscles from larynx to hyoid bone and skeleton ? sterno-thyroid , thyro-hyoid . Both the sterno-thyroid and thyro-hyoid are attached to the thyroid cartilage of the larynx , the former passes downwards to the breast bone ( sternum ) ; the latter passes upwards to attach to the edges of the hyoid bone , serving thus to control the relationship between the two . The influence of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not the hyoid bone is held firmly in a fixed position by the supra-hyoid muscles . If the hyoid bone is not fixed , the sterno-thyroid ( although not attached to the hyoid bone ) acts in concert with the thyro-hyoid to depress the hyoid bone . When the hyoid bone is fixed by the appropriate muscles , the thyro-hyoid muscle pulls the larynx upwards in the production of high notes ; while the sternothyroid pulls the larynx markedly down when low notes are produced . The hyoid bone is steaded by the supra-hyoid and infra-hyoid muscles , as a ship rides when anchored fore and aft . The hyoid bone , through its muscles , provides a fulcrum for the action of the tongue . The supra-hyoid and infra-hyoid groups act in concert , and , whether the bone is being raised by the former group or lowered by the latter , the opposing group steadies the bone like a guy-rope . Action of Muscles Concerned in Shaping Resonators and Positioning Larynx and Hyoid Bone Before discussing the co-ordinated action of the various tongue and neck muscles described above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles concerned will be summarized below , grouped roughly according to their function in enlarging or reducing the size of the oral and laryngeal pharynx ( opening and closing the throat ) . // Muscles which pull head and skeleton together-sterno-mastoid Muscles which pull hyoid bone DOWN towards skeleton ? sterno-hyoid , omo-hyoid ( infra-hyoid ) ( 3 ) Muscles which raise base of tongue uP and BACK-palato-glossus , stylo-glossus ( tongue muscles ) Muscles which pull hyoid bone uP and BACK stylo-hyoid , digastric ( supra-hyoid ) Muscles which raise hyoid bone UPWARDS and FoRwARDs ? genio-hyoid , mylo-hyoid , posterior genio-glossus ( supra-hyoid ) Muscles which draw tongue towards hyoid bone ? anterior genio-glossus , hyo-glossus ( supra-hyoid ) Muscles directly affecting larynx thyro-hyoid ? draws hyoid bone and larynx together sterno-thyroid ? draws larynx down towards sternum stylo-pharyngeus palato-pharyngeus It will be seen that the supra-hyoid muscles can be divided into ( a ) those which raise the hyoid bone up and back and are active in closing the throat ( stylo-hyoid and digastric ) and ( b ) those which raise the hyoid bone and draw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mylo-hyoid , hyo-glossus ) . The infra-hyoid are active in closing the throat . POSITION OF REST In the position of rest , although the muscles of the neck , hyoid bone and tongue have their normal tone , no attempt is being made to voluntarily tense them . The larynx is fairly low and the base of the tongue lies low and close to the posterior wall of the pharynx ( Fig. 40 ) . SWALLOWING In the first stages of swallowing , the mylo-hyoid and genio-hyoid , assisted by the digastric and stylo-hyoid ( groups 4 and 5 above ) . // raise the hyoid bone and the floor of the mouth , and the tongue is pressed against the palate , while the infra-hyoid group steadies the hyoid bone . Note that in swallowing , the genio-glossus and hyo-glossus are relaxed . This allows the palatine part of the tongue to be pushed up against the palate as the hyoid bone is raised , while the base of the tongue is drawn backwards . If the genio-glossus and genio-hyoid are tensed simultaneously , then the tongue is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Fig. 41 ( hyoid bone raised for-wards and palatine part of tongue drawn down towards hyoid bone ) . PROTRUDING THE TONGUE When the tongue is protruded the genio-hyoid is relaxed and the posterior fibres of the genio-glossus are tensed . OPEN THROAT ' POSITION To open the throat and enlarge its capacity , i.e. to pull the base of the tongue forwards and away from the posterior wall of the pharynx ( Fig. 41 ) , it is necessary to bring into simultaneous tension the genio hyoid , hyo-glossus and both the posterior and anterior fibres of the genio-glossus , while at the same time relaxing all the antagonistic neck and tongue muscles in groups 1 ? 4 ( page 125 ) . This is brought about as explained in Chapter XII and also by making an effort to pull the base of the tongue forwards , making sure that there is no tension directed to the neck , jaw or lips.l Note that it is possible to tense either the genio-hyoid or the genio glossus separately in conjunction with tension on the neck muscles ( as in swallowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not possible to tense both these muscles simultaneously while such tension on the neck muscles exists . It becomes more difficult to keep the throat open when singing high notes and extra effort may be needed in these circumstances . Apart from conscious effort to keep the throat open whilst singing , exercises may be undertaken to strengthen the genio-glossus and // genio-hyoid which will enable the base of the tongue to be drawn further forward . CLOSED THROAT ' POSITIONS While there is only one way of opening the throat , there are many ways of closing it . The singer must be aware of these as well as the manner of opening the throat , otherwise he may make many mis takes . Without this knowledge , the singer may have a completely false idea of the position of his tongue . Russell ' took X-ray photo-graphs of numerous singers , none of whom thought he was taking the tongue position X-rayed . One was so positive that he was not con vinced after having seen ten different exposures made on two differ ent days . The throat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It remains closed as a result of failure to tense the throat-opening muscles while the closure is increased if tension is placed on any of the throat-closing muscles . These latter actions may be achieved either deliberately or unwittingly if the actions of the muscles are not understood . Closed Throat ' ? Incorrect Tongue Tensions Tongue flattened ? base of tongue back and down . One of the most common errors is to think that merely flattening of the tongue opens the throat . What actually happens , unless effort is also made to pull the base of the tongue forwards , can be seen in Fig. 43 . Such flattening of the tongue enlarges the mouth cavity and the oro pharyngeal isthmus , but the base of the tongue is pushed right into the throat cavity towards the back wall of the pharynx , thus con stricting the throat cavity . In this case , the hyo-glossus and anterior fibres of the genio-glossus are tensed but the posterior fibres and the genio-hyoid are relaxed . Tongue against teeth ? base of tongue back and up . The throat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press the tongue against the lower teeth , but , in this case , the base will be pulled back and up . The muscular action is similar to protrusion of the tongue , i.e. the posterior fibres of the genio-glossus are tensed but the anterior fibres , the genio-hyoid and the hyo-glossus are re laxed . Meanwhile the palato-glossus and stylo-glossus are unhindered in their action of raising the base of the tongue up and back . // 3 . Tongue tensed in resting position . Another type of constriction of the throat occurs when the tongue relaxes as in the position of rest ( Fig. 40 ) and is then tensed in this position . It must not be thought , however , that a flat tongue or a tongue touching the teeth is a sign of a closed throat . The throat will close only if the action of flattening the tongue or placing it against the teeth is not accompanied by an effort to open the throat and pull forward the base of the tongue . The front part of the tongue may assume almost any position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , does so in the production of the different vowels when the technique is correct , but positioning the front part of the tongue alone will not ensure an open throat . Closed Throat ' ? Neck Muscles Tensed Any tension on the neck muscles ( sterno-mastoid , infra-hyoid group ) makes it impossible to maintain correct throat-opening tensions , it draws the hyoid bone and base of the tongue down and back , diminishes the length of the pharynx , squeezes the larynx and constricts the throat to a greater or lesser degree depending on the extent of the tensions applied . 129 IX Principles of Breath Control in Singing CONTROL OF INTRA-THORACIC PRESSURE Air flows from a region of higher pressure to one of lower pressure . During inspiration , the thorax is enlarged by muscular force , the pressure of the same quantity of air in the larger space drops so that the air outside at atmospheric pressure flows in through the glottis to equalize the pressure . During inspiration , the pressure of air in the lungs is below atmospheric because the thorax is normally enlarged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspira tion , the pressure of air in the lungs is the same as atmospheric . If now , the size of the thorax is reduced , the pressure will be raised accordingly as the air is compressed into a smaller space . If , however , air escapes from the thorax as in expiration , this will tend to reduce the pressure according to the rate of the airflow . The pressure of air in the lungs during expiration depends , therefore , on two factors ? the rate of reduction of thoracic capacity and the rate of air flow . The rate of air flow is influenced by the size of the opening of the glottis . If the capacity of the thorax is reduced at the same rate as air flows out , the pressure will be maintained . If contraction of the thorax is too slight in relation to the airflow , pressure will be reduced and vice versa . If the glottis is smaller , a higher pressure can be maintained with slower reduction of thoracic capacity . In normal breathing , when the voice is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elastic forces is faster than the rate of air escape through the glottis so that pressure is raised during expiration . The force exerted by elastic recoil in reducing the capacity of the thorax depends on the volume of air in the lungs ; the greater the volume the greater the force of elastic recoil . Therefore , the rate of reduction of thoracic capacity is greatest at the beginning of expira tion and grows less as expiration continues . The opening of the // glottis does not vary , however , as expiration proceeds . These facts explain why it is that intra-thoracic pressure is greatest at the begin-ning of expiration and gradually decreases as expiration proceeds . ' When muscular effort is employed during expiration , the reasons for the further increase in breath pressure involve both factors , i.e. faster reduction of thoracic capacity as well as narrowing of the glottis ( see below ) . In singing , the rate of reduction of thoracic capacity can be care-fully controlled as described in Chapter VI , but in order to under-stand the control of breath pressure in singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the glottis in these circumstances . Is vibration of the cords achieved by increasing the pressure of breath against the cords by more rapid reduction of thoracic capa-city ? In practice , we find that extremely powerful tones can be produced with the use of less breath than that used in the production of less powerful tones . How can this be ? CO-ORDINATION BETWEEN ABDOMINAL TENSION AND GLOTTAL OPENING ( a ) During Ordinary Breathing The opening between the vocal cords , i.e. the glottis , is controlled directly by two groups of muscles ? the abductors which separate the vocal cords and widen the lumen of the glottis , and the adductors which draw the vocal cords closer together and narrow the glottis . In normal quiet respiration , the action of the muscles controlling the glottis is carried out unconsciously . During inspiration , the glottis is wide open to facilitate air intake ; during expiration , it closes slightly . There are several theories why this closure takes place . It slows down the speed of expiration and thus prevents too sudden deflation of the lungs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of breathing best suited to man . It is possible that contraction of the adductor muscles may help to maintain infra-glottal airways in a state of opening . Negus2 has suggested that the closure of the glottis during expiration may , by raising the intra-thoracic pressure , put back pressure on the venous circulation and slow down the entrance of venous blood to the lungs during expiration when oxygenization can not be carried out effectively . Negus has also demonstrated the direct relationship which exists // between movements of the glottis and the movements of the anterior abdominal wall and his experiments indicate that the greater the tension on the abdominal muscles , the greater the closure of the glottis . The following diagram indicates the degree of movement of the thyro-arytenoid fold in a cat . The tracing shows the increase in opening and closure of the glottis during forced breathing and the decrease in the amplitude when the trachea is opened and breathing becomes normal . The increased magnitude of vocal cord movement does not appear to be dependent on the amount of air flow or air pressure ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of closure of the trachea ) but is more directly related to the degree of tension on the abdominal muscles during the expiratory phase . In Man , who has a much greater capacity for controlling muscular tensions , these movements may be even more pronounced . Another example of the association between abdominal tension and closure of the glottis is at the end of maximum inspiration when simultaneous contraction of the abdominal muscles and adduction of the vocal cords is one of the factors limiting inspiration . ' ( b ) During Whispering The relationship between the action of the respiratory muscles and vocal cord action in ordinary breathing has been described above . The observations of J. J. Pressman2 below give us reason to believe // that a similar mechanism operates during whispering and phonation . ' In whispering , the vocal cords come closer together but not as closely as they do in phonation . There remains a wide triangular gap through which air escapes , giving the whisper its breathy quality , while the vocal cords are sufficiently taut to vibrate at low intensity . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is automatically exerted on the abdominal muscles and it is found that this increased abdominal tension is again associated with further narrowing of the glottal opening . ( c ) During Phonation In phonation , the will to phonate and mental concepts of pitch adduct the vocal cords at a certain length and tension before phonation commences ( Pressman ) and the movements of the vocal cords become more complex . J. J. Pressman has shown that the vibratory movements of the vocal cords during phonation are in two directions , vertical and horizontal . He has pointed out that increases in amplitude of the vibrations during the production of more powerful tones are repre sented by a greater horizontal swing towards the midline , i.e. a more complete closure of the vocal cords , He has also shown that they remain closed for a longer period on higher intensities . From this it would seem that the greater amplitude of the vibra tions is not simply a result of ever-increasing quantity of breath or pressure of breath against the vocal cords but is a matter of changes in tension of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this increased amplitude of the vocal cord vibrations is an indirect result of increased tension on the abdominal muscles , similar to the action in normal respiration and whispering when tension on these muscles is increased ; if greater amplitude of the vibrations was a result simply of greater quantity or greater pressure of breath against the vocal cords , we should expect to see an increase in the vertical displacement of the cords or a greater horizontal swing of the vocal cords away from the midline , causing wider opening of the glottis.2 // It must be stressed that , as in forced expiration and more intense whispering , this increased amplitude and closer adduction of the vocal cords during more intense phonation is not a result of conscious control of the larynx , but occurs in association with increased tension on the abdominal muscles . VERTICAL DISPLACEMENT OF VOCAL CORD VIBRATIONS What then are the factors affecting the vertical displacement of the vocal cords ? As suggested above , once the size of the glottis has been set according to mental concepts of tone , the amplitude of vocal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of abdominal tension rather than on the pressure of breath . As the // amplitude of vocal cord vibration increases in phonation and the glottis narrows accordingly , a higher breath pressure will be main tained even with slower reduction of thoracic capacity . I suggest that the breath pressure so created by inward movement of the thoracic cage then affects the vertical swing of the tensed cords whose horizontal movement has already been determined by the degree of abdominal tension exerted . The extent of the vertical swing , and thus the depth of vocal cord in action , will depend on changes in intra-thoracic pressure . These pressure changes arise when the rate of reduction of thoracic capacity is varied in relation to breath flow through the glottis which , as explained above , is a result of independent control of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles ( see page 102 ) , Figs. 47 and 48 . The greater the adduction of the vocal cords , the less reduction of thoracic capacity is needed to make sufficient pressure to vibrate the same depth of vocal cord vertically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cords affects the quality , not the intensity , of the tone . As the size of the glottis is altered by other factors , changes in breath pressure will have to be made accordingly if the correct vertical swing is to be maintained . DUAL CONTROL OF BREATHING Laryngeal tone is thus not simply a matter of breath or breath pressure affecting the amplitude of vocal cord vibration as is gener ally believed . It is a complex process whereby abdominal tension affects the tension of the vocal cords and the amplitude of their vibration while , at the same time , the state of the glottis resulting from such abdominal tension in turn helps to control breath pressure which then affects the mass of vocal cord vibrating . Thus , as Negus points out , the vocal cords have a function in controlling breath // pressure as well as being in turn controlled by it . Breath pressure in phonation is not a simple one-way process as it is when the breath is held or as it would be if the glottis remained unaltered . It is , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing muscles is accompanied by more powerful tone and many teachers believe that this is due to increased pressure of air in the lungs vibrating the cords more strongly . This , of course , is an oversimplification which does not really explain how breath pressure is increased and decreased . It is an over-simplification in which the dualism of breath control is not recognized , a dualism arising from the fact that pressure of air in a container may be raised either by increasing the rate of compression or reducing the size of the opening . It is an over-simplification which does not explain how increased power is accompanied by the flow of less , not more , breath because intensity is related not to breath flow but to abdominal tension , and its effect on the vocal cord vibrations . In practice , the difference between these two concepts is that in the one case , breath control implies dual control with independent use of the diaphragm and abdominal muscles , while in the second case , the logical result of an incomplete , one-way conception of breath pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not produce effective results . ( This statement must be qualified only in that the amount of independent control is not unlimited ; a certain interdependence exists which will be explained below . ) The preceding theory as to the co-ordination between the respiratory muscles and vocal cord action will now be discussed in relation to practical problems of voice production . First , however , let us summarize this theory briefly in the following rules which form the basis of a practical means of breath control , and which are but different ways of expressing the same principles . The reader is reminded that the vocal cords vibrate horizontally as well as vertically and that increased amplitude of the vibrations is represented by a greater horizontal swing towards the midline , i.e. a more complete closure of the glottis . The vocal cords are not , as is commonly thought , forced wider apart as the power of the tone is increased . Increased pressure affects rather the quality of the tone as the increased vertical swing of the cords results in a greater mass of vocal cord in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abdominal muscles : ( a ) the greater the amplitude of the vibrations ; // ( b ) the greater the power of the tone ; ( c ) the greater the closure of the glottis ; and therefore ( d ) the higher the breath pressure ( if , as the size of the glottal opening is reduced , thoracic capacity continues to decrease at the same rate ) . 2 . The greater the tension on the diaphragm : ( a ) the less the inward movement of the thorax ; ( b ) the lower the rate of breath expulsion ; and therefore ( c ) the smaller the mass of vocal cord in vibration ; ( b ) the lower the breath pressure ( assuming abdominal tension remains constant ) because of the slower reduction of thoracic capacity against a glottis of the same size . Conversely , the greater the relaxation of the diaphragm : ( a ) the greater the contraction of the chest cavity ; ( b ) the higher the rate of breath expulsion ; and therefore ( c ) the greater the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the higher the breath pressure because of the faster reduction of thoracic capacity against a glottis of the same size . Whether tension on the respiratory muscles makes more or less breath pressure depends , then , on which of the respiratory muscles are concerned . Thus : If tension is added only to the abdominal muscles , pressure is increased . If tension is added only to the diaphragm , pressure is reduced . It follows therefore that if tension is added simultaneously to both the abdominal muscles and diaphragm , increase of pressure due to further closure of the glottal opening is cancelled out by decrease of pressure due to slower reduction of thoracic capacity . In this case , the pressure will tend to remain constant . The same will happen in reverse if tensions are reduced simultaneously on both sets of muscles , i.e. decrease of pressure due to widening of the glottal opening as the abdominal muscles relax is cancelled out by increase of pressure due to faster reduction of thoracic capacity as the diaphragm relaxes . Or , to put it another way , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slower the rate of reduction of thoracic capacity needed to make the same pressure , and this is achieved automatically by the natural tendency to increase tension // on the diaphragm at the same time as it is being increased on the abdominal muscles ? and vice versa if the tensions are reduced . It will be noted from the above rules that it is possible to increase breath pressure in two ways ? ( a ) by increasing the tension only on the abdominal muscles and ( b ) by reducing tension only on the diaphragm . If the first method of raising breath pressure is chosen , the amplitude of the vibrations , and thus the power of the tone , is increased . If the second method is chosen , the mass of vocal cord in vibration is increased and the quality of the tone is altered , the volume of breath expelled will increase but any increase in power will be negligible . LIMITATION OF DUAL CONTROL If it were possible to continue increasing abdominal tension and reducing diaphragmic tension at the same time , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods with disastrous results . Fortunately , there is a limit to the extent of the dual control described above and thus a limit to the extent to which this can occur . In practice , we find that the will to phonate is accom-panied by sufficient tension on the respiratory muscles to slow down the reduction of thoracic capacity so that , as the glottis becomes smaller , the breath pressure does not become too great . Then , during phonation , the natural tendency is to increase or decrease tension of both sets of muscles simultaneously when making changes in intensity . This co-ordinated action has the effect on breath pressure described above which provides a natural check against its being raised to a harmful level . ' As tensions on the respiratory muscles are increased or reduced simultaneously in this way , the breath pressure is maintained generally on a suitable level as the increase in pressure by one method is compensated by a corresponding decrease in the other . As a general rule , therefore , it is correct to say that the tension on the respiratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , must be modified somewhat as the setting of the vocal cords alters in relation to changing concepts of pitch , dynamics and colour . In practice , therefore , it is essential to // operate the dual control outlined above to the extent necessary for the establishment of appropriate vocal tones . EXTENT OF DUAL CONTROL In normal speech , the tensions on the abdominal muscles and diaphragm co-ordinate as above with each other and with laryngeal movements in such a manner that breath pressure and breath flow are correctly adjusted to produce the sounds desired . This natural co-ordination ensures that the breath pressure does not become so high that too much depth of vocal cord is vibrated , or so low that too little cord is vibrated . This is a co-ordination learnt in early childhood . In singing , the fine co-ordinations required are not natural and must be acquired . A similar general co-ordination applies but it is not so accurate that it ensures production of the best tone quality over the much greater pitch and intensity range used . The breath pressures can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low on different notes for the most satisfying vocal tone and can be so high as to harm the vocal cords . In some cases too much depth of vocal cord is vibrated and in other cases , too little.l This can not be corrected or adjusted by trying to control the vocal cords but only by altering the ratio between abdominal tension and the rate of reduction of thoracic capacity . Fortunately , as described above , while the tensions on the respiratory muscles are related to each other , there is sufficient possible independence of movement to correct this state of affairs and this is something of which the singer must learn to take full advantage in order to make the greatest possible improvement to the tone , on any frequency and at whatever intensity is chosen . APPLICATION OF DUAL CONTROL Thus , development of a singer 's breathing involves two main objectives ? ( a ) increase of tension on the abdominal muscles in order to increase the amplitude of the vibrations and the power of the voice ; and ( b ) careful control over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on all notes so that the most beautiful vocal tone is obtained with no harm to the vocal cords . The tension on both sets of muscles ( diaphragm and abdominal ) // must be in the correct ratio for every tone sung . On certain notes , the natural co-ordination may provide the tones required . On other notes , the singer may need to depart considerably from the natural co-ordination just as a skier has to overcome a natural , instinctive muscular co-ordination in order to execute a skilful turn . This is one reason why pianissimo is a real test of a singer 's technique ; the co-ordination required for pianissimo departs furthest from the natural co-ordination . Similarly , greater control is needed for the higher and lower notes of a singer 's range than for the middle notes , where the natural muscular co-ordinations are much nearer to those which produce the correct ratio of breath flow to glottal opening . If the teacher understands the principles of correct co-ordination between breathing and vocal cord action , no harm can come to the vocal cords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is because as the increased amplitude of the vibrations reduces the size of the glottis , the volume of breath is decreased accordingly . As indicated above , this is achieved automatically to a great extent , but must be carefully controlled to obtain absolute results . Careful control of breath volume is necessary because the greater the mass of vocal cord in action , the greater the tension needed on the laryngeal muscles to maintain pitch . ' Thus , if the diaphragm is too relaxed and too much breath is used , the muscles controlling the vocal cords may be placed under too much strain and there may be poor intonation . Incorrect co-ordination may occur on any note at any intensity if the diaphragm is too relaxed in relation to abdominal tension . If this occurs , even when the power is low the tone will be , and will sound forced , as the greater volume of air under compression will vibrate too much mass of the vocal cords . This state tends to occur particularly on high notes where the ratio of diaphragmic tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diaphragm is tightened up so that less breath is used , it may be possible to use even greater abdominal tension with no forcing of the intrinsic muscles of the larynx . Incorrect co-ordination of this type may not harm the vocal mechanism on the lower notes and lower intensities as it most cer tainly will on the higher notes and higher intensities , but even on the lower notes and lower intensities it can have far-reaching conse consequences . ' Many people will be surprised to learn that forcing can be caused by too much relaxation , but this is indeed the case if the diaphragm is too relaxed in relation to the tension on the abdominal muscles ; and // it can be easily proved by the immediate improvement in tone if the diaphragm is put under greater tension while the abdominal tension remains constant . On the other hand , if the tension on the diaphragm is too great in relation to abdominal tension , the pressure will be too low to vibrate sufficient mass of the vocal cord to make good tone and it will be necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abdominal muscles , depending on the intensity and colour of the tone required . There is a tendency for this state to occur in the lower part of a singer 's range , as this is where most breath is needed . Thus , it is not the tension on any one of these groups of muscles that is important . It is the ratio of tension between the two that must be correctly controlled for every type of tone on every pitch . What happens when the action of these two muscle groups is not understood can now be easily imagined . The great majority of teach ers and writers on singing speak only of the diaphragm and say little or nothing of the abdominal muscles . In ignorance of the above facts a student , when asked by his teacher to tighten the diaphragm ' , usually adds tension indiscriminately to both sets of muscles ( dia phragm and abdominal ) and is quite incapable of exercising inde pendent control . r Before concluding this chapter , it should be noted that tension may be added to muscles either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce tension in the muscles concerned ; or indirectly , as a result of desire to perform an action or produce a certain type of tone . Apart from being more accurate for all but the very advanced singer , 2 the first method makes possible the production of a greater degree of tension in the respiratory muscles than that which results indirectly from trying to sing more powerfully . SUPPORT To simplify instructions and further explanations we shall use the well . known term support ' to indicate the general level of tension in both groups of antagonistic respiratory muscles ? diaphragm and abdominal . We shall also speak of more or less breath flow in relation to the amount of support ' ? to be obtained , of course , by exercising independent control of the two muscle groups . 144 X Control of the Laryngeal Mechanism Once the principles of breath control are understood , a practical set of breathing rules can not be evolved , however , without detailed knowledge of the working of the larynx and resonators . One could experiment with various ratios of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to judge the results one must be able to relate these to knowledge of the effect on the tone of all other factors in the production of the voice . Our knowledge of the larynx is still by no means complete but it is sufficient to be of great practical assistance ; whereas in former times , a teacher had to work almost entirely in the dark as far as knowledge of the laryngeal mechanism was concerned , he now has definite pointers and sign-posts which enable him to work with much greater efficiency and saving of valuable time . The method of trial and error indicated above is still necessary to a degree and will never be entirely ruled out in practicer but our present knowledge of the working of the larynx enables us to gain a much deeper theoretical understanding of the vocal mechanism which is an essential prerequisite to im proving our training technique . We have seen in Chapter IX the relationship between the respira tory mechanism and the amplitude and depth of vocal cord vibrations on a single note in which other factors remain constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the changes that occur in the vocal cords as a result of changing mental concepts which adduct the vocal cords accordingly at a certain length and tension before phonation commences , or which alter the setting of the vocal cords during phonation independently of any changes which may occur in control of the breathing mechanism . These are : Changes in the state of the vocal cords as the concept of the pitch of the note is altered ; these changes have been described in detail in Chapter VII.2 Changes in dynamic concepts and concepts of colour.3 // THE LARYNX IN RELATION TO PITCH CHANGES The significant changes occurring in the larynx on an ascending scale may be summarized as follows : 1 . The tension of the muscles controlling the vocal cords , including the thyro-arytenoid muscles within the cords themselves , gradually increases . 2 . The size of the glottis ( the opening between the vocal cords ) gradually decreases . Now , how do these facts help in the formulation of a set of breathing rules applicable to singing ? How should the respiratory muscles be controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important lesson to be learnt from the researches of French , Pressman and others is that the changes that take place in the vocal cords in relation to pitch are gradual and we may assume from this that changes in the use of the breath should also be gradual . If we find the pattern of gradual change in breath control to accord with the gradual changes in the vocal cords as the pitch rises , we will have come a long way in the understanding of vocal technique . The second assumption we can make is that , if as the pitch rises , the opening of the glottis becomes smaller , it follows that the amount of breath required will gradually decrease . In other words , a greater amount of breath flow will be needed to make the vocal cords vibrate at sufficient thickness on a low note where the glottis is very wide than on a high note where the glottis is very small . In practice , we find that this assumption is correct and breath volume must be decreased as the scale is ascended , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension usually increases simultaneously with increased diaphragmic tension , and as an evenly-rising scale requires greater intensity on the higher notes , we can also assume that greater abdominal tension is required as the pitch ascends . In practice , we find that this assumption is also correct . It can therefore be taken as a rule that the higher the pitch the greater the abdominal tension and the greater the diaphragmic tension required . Any experienced teacher knows that in most cases an untrained singer does instinctively endeavour to increase tension on the breathing muscles in this way as the pitch rises but is this increase sufficient for the requirements of an evenly-rising scale ? And is the automatic increase of diaphragmic tension in relation to abdominal // tension sufficiently accurate or is it necessary for the singer to exer-cise independent control over these two muscle groups ? The answer to the first question is that the untrained singer rarely increases these tensions sufficiently . He may be able to produce good tone in the middle of his range but this will become thinner and weaker as he ascends the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer produce the notes . Full extension of the range will require a great deal of experience in control of the larynx and the breathing , but it is not unusual for several notes to be added to a beginner 's range merely by his learning to take in the breath correctly and to increase the tensions generally on the abdominal muscles and diaphragm as he sings an ascending scale . The answer to the second question posed above is that even when the general level of tension on the breathing muscles is increased sufficiently during the production of an evenly-rising scale , the natural co-ordination between diaphragm and abdominal muscles is not such as to produce uniform fullness of tone . ( If it were , the task of the teacher would be much simpler ! ) It is therefore essential to use a certain amount of independent control and teachers fail who do not understand the nature of this independent control . In many years of experience I have found that the following basic pattern of gradual change applies to all singers , the only variation lying in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern before training . If we take Fig. 49A1 as showing diagramatically the average natural co-ordination between abdominal and diaphragmic tension when ascending a scale , and Fig. 49B as showing the increased abdominal tension necessary for an evenly-rising scale ( with automatic natural increase of diaphragmic tension ) , Fig. 49c ( heavy lines ) will give an idea of the adjustment that is necessary to sing a scale of evenly rising intensity with fullness of tone maintained throughout and without forcing the vocal mechanism . If we compare Figs. 49B and c we can see that it is necessary to reduce diaphragmic tension on the lower notes in relation to the same abdominal tension and to increase it on the higher notes . This // is because ( a ) in most cases , the natural co-ordination provides too little volume of breath on lower notes where the vocal cords are less tense because of pitch requirements and where the glottis is consequently wider , and ( b ) on high notes the natural co-ordination does not reduce sufficiently the amount of breath volume to accord with the shortening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of the opening of the glottis . Thus , if the natural co-ordination is allowed to take place , the tone will be thin on the bottom through insufficient breath , and too dark and heavy on the higher notes through too much breath . THE LARYNX IN RELATION TO PITCH AND INTENSITY CHANGES It is now a simple matter to relate the breathing rules concerning amplitude of the vibrations on a single frequency ( see page 139 ? 41 ) to the changing requirements of pitch . As we learnt in Chapter IX increase in amplitude is simply a matter of increasing the general level of tensions on the respiratory muscles , during which the breath flow decreases accordingly . We can relate this rule to the breathing requirements of notes of varying frequency by studying the following examples : If we wish to increase the intensity of a low note ( less abdominal tension and higher breath flow required than on higher notes ) it will be necessary to increase the abdominal tension and reduce the breath flow accordingly , so that the amounts used are more like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Similarly , the breathing requirements of a middle note of high intensity will be closer to those of a higher note at medium intensity . An increase in intensity thus tends towards cancelling out the adjustments required for a lowering of pitch ; a decrease of intensity tends towards cancelling out the adjustments required for a raising of pitch as follows : Raising the intensity calls for less breath and more support . Lowering the pitch calls for more breath and less support . Thus , if the singer lowers the pitch and raises the intensity at the same time , he will have to make little or no adjustment to his breathing . ( There is not a great deal of latitude for changes of intensity on the very high and very low notes . ) In our attempts to put the above theories into practice our knowledge of the effect of different respiratory tensions on the vocal cords is of considerable assistance . If we know that increased amplitude is // obtained by increased abdominal tension , and that greater thickness of vocal cord is vibrated with greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can immediately ( provided we have acquired the necessary skill ) rectify thinness of tone caused by too small a mass of vocal cord , or dullness of tone caused by too great a mass of vocal cord , vibrating on any intensity . CONTROL OF DYNAMICS The above , however , is not all there is to the question of vocal strength , and adding tension to the breathing muscles is not the only means of increasing power . Nor is it all there is to control of the vocal cords . Unfortunately , our knowledge of the working of the larynx is more limited scientifically here than it is in relation to pitch . Statements on amplitude , such as that of Pressman above , show how much interesting work remains to be done in this field . For example , Pressman talks about increases in breath pressure but does not distinguish between the two different methods of raising intra-thoracic pressure and does not make this distinction in his observations of the vocal cords in action . Also he does not consider whether the vocal cords are affected directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner similar to the way they are affected by changing concepts of pitch , i.e. not as a result of respiratory action . To fully appreciate the problem , the reader must understand that increase or decrease in amplitude of the vibrations as described above is not the same thing as changing the dynamics with all the variations between double pianissimo and double fortissimo . If the singer has no means of altering the dynamics other than by varying the tension on the abdominal muscles , his dynamic range will be very limited and , when using a small amount of support , the result will not be pianissimo but an ineffective sound with little carrying power . Any singer with an effective pianissimo will testify to the fact that it requires even greater tension on the abdominal muscles than a fortissimo tone and this is puzzling until we realize that dynamics is also the function of a little-understood control of the vocal cords . When this control is thoroughly understood and consciously operated there is a different setting of the vocal cords for every variation in dynamics . On a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension is low , we shall have a pianissimo of low intensity ; if the // tension is increased we shall have a pianissimo of a higher intensity . Although the amplitude of the actual sound waves is affected both by change in the dynamic concept controlling the vocal cords directly , as well as by increase in respiratory tensions controlling the vocal cords indirectly , to avoid confusion throughout this book the word intensity ' will always relate to the amount of abdominal tension ( support ) . Changes in the dynamic concepts ? pianissimo to fortissimo ? will relate to the direct mental control over the vocal cords we are about to consider . Unfortunately , in musical notation , the terms pianissimo , mezzo forte and fortissimo sometimes require a change of intensity and at other times a change in the setting of the vocal cords mentioned above , or both . Furthermore , the term intensity ' is usually applied in connection with both these phenomena which , as can be expected , results in a great deal of confusion . When the setting of the vocal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must use his discretion at all times in deciding whether to use this control or to employ a change of intensity in order to produce the most appropriate effect . When this is not understood , the instruction to sing a note pianissimo more often than not results in a drop of intensity ( and a decrease in effectiveness ) while the instruction to sing fortissimo will not produce a thrilling , resounding note no matter how much breath support is given , and no matter how correct the resonance , unless the necessary adjustment to the vocal cord setting is made . Similarly ( and this may help to illuminate the point ) if one has the mental concept of a whisper , increase of tension on the abdominal muscles will increase the intensity of the whisper , but a whisper it will remain and no amount of additional tension on the abdominal muscles will make it anything but a whisper unless the mental concept controlling the setting of the vocal cords is altered . The control I am about to describe is used to some extent by every singer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been clearly analysed and isolated , and because he uses it instinctively and unconsciously , its full potential to the singer as a means of controlling his tone is rarely achieved . Most untrained singers do not use this control at all but adhere to a setting somewhere along the possible range between pianissimo and fortissimo and try for dynamic effects mainly by altering the respiratory tensions . They may find it very difficult psychologically to accept the sound of a different setting . Trained singers who may have good breath control may alter the // setting as a result of musical instinct ' but , unfortunately , not with the accuracy possible when one has greater understanding of the technique . They may be encouraged by various indirect means to alter the setting of their vocal cords but the amount of variation obtained by traditional methods of training is very limited . CONTROL OF THE VOCAL CORDS AND DEFINITION OF THE TERM EDGE ' We have described above the differences in the state of the vocal cords between breathing and a whisper and between a whisper and a phonated sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from changes in the mental concepts from that of merely breathing to that of whispering or phonation , the vocal cords becoming progressively closer together as one changes the concept from that of breathing , first to that of whispering and then to that of phonating . Similar differences in the distance between the vocal cords , and in the strength of their vibration , can be obtained solely as a result of different concepts of tone during phonation . The student should place his hand lightly on his neck , breathe without making any sound , and then whisper a vowel such as which does not require any adjustment of the resonators . He will not feel any tensing of the muscles in the neck but will be conscious of exactly where the whisper is being produced . He should then phonate lightly , taking care not to place any tension on the muscles of the neck or jaw . A soft sounding tone will be produced and he will be able to feel an intensification of the same muscular action that produced the whisper . Again , without placing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as a result of an intensification of the same muscular action that came into play when changing from a whisper to a softly phonated tone , other tones can be produced which are much harder and steelier and in which the vocal cords come together more strongly still . All these sounds , provided they are produced without any tension on the neck or jaw muscles , are the sounds on which the mature voice is built ; the soft sounds when supported sufficiently by the breathing will become the vibrant , floating pianissimo tones , the harder sounding tones will be the fortissimo tones and in between we will have the mezzo forte . To think in terms of pianissimo or fortissimo are concepts too vague for the student to take hold of and will not automatically produce the correct degree of hardness or what we term ' edge ' ? that // characteristic of a well-produced voice that the teachers of the old Italian school called the metal or the steel of the voice . This is particularly so as the degree of hardness or edge required for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very difficult for a student to realize just how much edge he should hear in the tone in these very varied circumstances in order to satisfy the audience . Much more satisfactory progress is made by letting the student concentrate on being able to vary his edge at will . When he has mastered the technique ? when he has had practice in varying the tension on the muscles that increase the strength of the edge ' and is familiar with the sounds that result ? the singer will be able to reverse the process and bring the muscles under the required tension merely by conceiving of the type of tone desired ; he must then learn to judge the degree of edge required in relation to the musical and interpretative requirements of the score . Another method of localizing the point at which muscular tension should be intensified to produce a stronger edge tone is to note the area which is affected by changing the mental concept of the pitch of the note . It will be found that it is in the same area in which is felt physiological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing to that of whispering and phonation . It must be stressed that edge or hard edge refers to the sound the singer hears and the amount of tension on the muscles described in the preceding paragraphs ; it does not refer to the sound the audience hears . We do not intend any tone that is harsh or unpleasant to the listener . What will be experienced by the singer himself as a hard edge tone will be heard by the audience as a bright , resonant , unforced tone provided , that is , that the hard edge tone is produced in accordance with the technical considerations given . A simple experiment should make this quite clear . A student should ask a friend to stand a foot away from him while he sings with a strong hard edge on a middle note at medium or high intensity . The friend will hear a sound very similar to the sound the singer himself is hearing . This will be a harsh , thin sound . Now the friend should move to a position nine or ten feet away while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound as heard by the singer will of course be the same , but the sound as heard by the listener will be softened and modified by the acoustics of the room or hall , and more so if he moves still further away although the singer is still hearing the same harsh sound . If , however , the singer now produces the same hard edge on a high // note and the experiment is repeated , it will be all too painfully clear that if he uses in another part of his range the same kind of tone that produced such excellent results in the first experiment , he will not necessarily have the same success . He must learn , therefore , to recognize those circumstances where a hard edge is appropriate and those circumstances where it will produce a tone which is unaccept able to his audience and harmful to the voice . This intensification of the sound by altering the vocal cord setting directly is in contrast to the action of the average untrained singer ( and many trained ' singers ) who , when asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or simply open the mouth wider and yell with an uncontrolled too open ' sound . Both these latter actions are harmful to the voice , whereas additional power gained by increase of edge will not harm the vocal cords when introduced in accordance with the rules given below . If the reader wishes to hear what is meant by hard and soft edge tone , he can do no better than to get Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau 's recording of a Schubert Lieder Recital No. 4 , ALP 1827 and , on Side 2 , Band 3 , listen to Greisengesang ' , where very clearly defined hard and soft edges are used . One hearing of these tones is worth pages of description but it must , of course , be remembered that these tones are as heard by the audience and not by the singer in per formance . However , on this particular recording , because of the lie of the song and the particularly clear definition , it will be possible for the student to get a good idea of what is required of him in his internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge without realizing they are doing so because its use is so habitual and natural to them ( and they are usually the ones people describe as having good natural voices ) . On the other hand , we find singers who begin their training without using any appreciable amount of edge , who are averse to or frightened of using an edge , and who find it difficult to realize that the difference between their smaller ' voices and the envied singer with the fine natural voice ' lies not in any great physical difference in the vocal organs but in different habits of vocal production which have developed for many and varied reasons since childhood , partly psychological and temperamental and partly environmental . l // The following quotation from a general outline of phonetic theory written for Nuttall 's Standard Dictionary under the direction of Professor Daniel Jones , M.A. , D.Phil. , is of interest as it describes how these differences are expressed in the fabric of language . All vowel sounds are voiced sounds ; consonants may be voiced or voiceless . Languages vary among themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the articulation of their voiced sounds . As a general rule it may be observed that Romance languages use a greater amount of vocal vibration than Teutonic languages ; the former making use of fully voiced consonants , the latter of partially voiced and devoiced consonants . English seems to show a preference for the partially voiced variety . ' It is often just as difficult to persuade a natural hard edge singer to sing with less edge , especially on the top of his range , as it may be to overcome the inhibitions and fears of a natural soft edge singer who finds difficulty in producing a hard edge tone . The former problem applies more so in the case of male singers , the latter more so in the case of female singers . Many teachers also fail for similar reasons ; having always had a strong edge voice , or having developed it as a result of indirect methods over a great many years , they do not understand that a student who is not used to producing his voice in this way will be unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge than the teacher himself , because of his different vocal influences , has ever had to conceive of . Edge is thus a very relative , subjective concept in the minds of different people . In order to get two students to sing an identically produced note , it may be necessary to ask one to use a stronger edge and the other to use a weaker edge . When making such adjustments , however , it is essential that they are made to the setting of the vocal cords only , as described above , and not to other parts of the vocal mechanism . Perhaps the greatest harm to the voice is caused when a singer who is unable to consciously control the amount of edge and who , when asked to produce a more mellow tone , will instead of using less edge , close down the resonators while the vocal cords are still vibrating strongly . The resulting tone may be what is often called covered ' but if it is produced in this way it can harm the vocal cords if persisted in . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the neck and jaw , // and the stronger the edge in these circumstances , the more potentially harmful to the vocal cords . It should also be realized that when a singer has learned to increase the amount of edge in circumstances where a stronger edge is required , he may tend to want to use a similar amount in other circumstances where this is not desirable and this temptation must of course be resisted and controlled . It is easier at first for the student to produce a stronger edge with the mouth more closed but , with more experience , this will be no longer necessary . The most useful exercise for increasing the edge ' and for gaining control over the vocal cord vibrations is staccato . It is through these staccato exercises , however , that eventually a stronger legato line may be achieved . TECHNIQUE OF DYNAMIC CONTROL When a soft edge tone ( pianissimo ) is employed , the vocal cords are more relaxed and more breath flow and more support is required than when a stronger edge is used in mezzo forte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vocal cords are more tense , less breath flow and less support is required than for pianissimo singing , although more than for mezzo forte , in order to obtain the required crescendo effect . If a high support is used , it will be unlikely that the singer will use too much edge . On the other hand , if there is insufficient support , there is a temptation to use more edge than is desirable in an attempt to sing with sufficient power . In this case , the voice will sound hard and strained to the listener . This is especially so , of course , on the higher notes . Greater care must therefore be exercised on this account when singing with a low support than when the support is high . When the support is high , there may on the other hand be a ten dency to use too little edge and it is a pity if this is allowed to happen as the potential quality of the voice will not be fully realized . The technique of dynamic control may be summarized in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a plus ' amount of edge is reserved for fortissimo passages . Apart from this , it will be required only occasionally for special effects as indicated on pages 164 to 167 , and for the lower notes in the lower-pitched voices . ' . // Thus , if we go from m. f to p. the rule is : The softer the edge , the more support , and the greater the breath flow . If we go from m. f to f the rule is : When the edge is increased , support and breath flow are increased accordingly but not as much as for pianissimo . The increased breath flow in each case above is largely automatic and no attempt need be made by the singer in general to augment it although he must make sure , particularly in pianissimo , that he has sufficient capacity ( see Fig. 50 ) . Thus , in dynamic deviations from the normal m.f. level , either towards fortissimo for a crescendo or towards pianissimo for a decrescendo , one increases the support and breath flow in both cases according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , the edge will be increased while in the latter it will be decreased . Of course , one must expect the voice to tire after it has been used a great deal , just as one 's body tires after exercise or activity . But this is natural and the more edge one uses the more quickly the voice will tire . However , the greater the support at the singer 's command , and the more skilful he is , the less edge will it be necessary for him to use in order to give a satisfying performance , and when rehearsing a role he should of course conserve his voice not so much by reducing the support as by taking care to use less edge . Similarly , the more support the singer uses , the more his body will tire and in planning an exacting operatic role or recital the singer must take both these factors into consideration so that he is not exhausted either physically or vocally before he has completed his performance . If the production is correct , he is more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he should bear this fact in mind when husbanding his resources . Physically speaking , a singer can very quickly learn to use as much edge as will ever be required of him , although psychological factors // may make this process more difficult for him . Building up of adequate support , however , requires considerably greater time , effort and will-power . He should therefore regard the edge as the steel of the voice which gives it vibrancy and life but not power . His power-house is his support . Thus , when there is sufficient edge in the tone , he must not attempt to increase this further but must get all the additional power from his breathing muscles . As his support increases , the range of tones at his command increases and so must his skill in relating support , breath flow and edge to every note in his range and every dynamic effect within his scope . PITCH QUALITY AND DYNAMICS Just as the breathing ratios must be related to pitch , the amount of edge must be in correct relationship not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breathing ratios employed . All the most important elements of singing technique are summed up in this one sentence which should dominate the singer 's attitude to every note he utters. // On the lower notes , where the vocal cords are more relaxed and wider apart , a comparatively strong edge tone is essential if the voice is going to be fully effective even when the marking is m.f . On high notes , however , a strong edge is unnecessary if there is sufficient support and can be harmful to the voice if employed because of the greater tension of the vocal cords in this part of the range . A high note , up to about Ab , when sung fortissimo will of course require a stronger edge than when sung pianissimo but it will certainly be less than that required for a fortissimo note of lower frequency . ( Above Ab there is not much latitude for changes of intensity or edge . ) The foregoing may be summarized in the following rule : Edge , support and breath flow in relation to pitch The higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the less support , the less breath flow , the more breath flow , the less edge . the stronger the edge . When the above rule is studied in conjunction with those on page 157 , it will be apparent that the amount of edge for any dynamic effect will vary according to the pitch of the note . Mezzo forte on a low note will therefore require a stronger edge than mezzo forte on higher note . Pianissimo on a low note will require a slightly stronger edge than pianissimo on a middle note . It will also be apparent why top notes and pianissimo are such a test of a singer 's technique and skill . On top notes , he needs the highest support and the confidence that this support will vibrate the vocal cords without need to supplement the tone by use of the same edge as he employs on the lower notes . And on pianissimo , he needs the greatest breath capacity , a very high support as for top notes and the least amount of edge . The reader should now understand why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed top notes with weak low notes . This will of course be due to the fact that this singer has a preference for soft edge tones which , with adequate support , will give good top notes , but which is insufficient for effective lower notes . On the other hand , a singer with a good lower range and no top will be one who uses a strong edge on lower notes , but has insufficient support for the greater demands of his high notes and inability to phase out the edge as the pitch rises , so that his only resort is to falsetto when the 159
