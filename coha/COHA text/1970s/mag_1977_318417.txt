When a newspaper wins the top Pulitzer Prize for journalistic excellence , one might expect it to flourish like the biblical green bay tree-or at least the Washington Post after Watergate . <P> There are no bay trees , green or otherwise , in Alaska , however , and last spring 's Pulitzer gold-medal winner for public service , Anchorage 's Daily News ( TIME , May 17 ) , is having a long dark winter . To reduce expenses , the paper has had to trim its editorial staff from 21 to twelve . Two of the three reporters whose Pulitzer-winning articles revealed the stranglehold that the Teamsters have gained on Alaskan labor have left for better jobs , and the morning Daily News ' circulation of 11,600 has shrunk to 7,580 . But Publisher Katherine Fanning , 49 , who with her husband bought the paper in 1967 after leaving her native Illinois , is fighting back . She has sued Anchorage 's other newspaper , the Times , for $16.5 million because , she says , it is trying to put her out of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already battered Daily News merged its advertising , circulation and production departments with those of the far larger Times ( circ. 45,350 ) . Only the editorial departments remained separate : the News continued to ask awkward questions about conservation while the Times remained boosterish about the Alaska oil pipeline and any other scheme that might improve the state 's economy . <P> The purpose of the merger , of course , was to lower operating expenses for the loss-ridden Daily News . The deal , however , had the opposite effect . In the last year before joining up with the Times , Fanning 's paper lost $650,000 . A year later the red ink was even redder : $750,000 . Worse , according to Fanning 's lawsuit , Times Publisher Robert B. Atwood and his staff have tried to kill the competition by scaring off potential Daily News advertisers and subscribers , mismanaging the paper 's financial affairs and letting its distribution system go to pot Says Kay Fanning , who took over the paper on her husband 's death in 1971 : " Of the 22 other joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the only one not working to the benefit of both newspapers . " <P> Atwood , 69 , disputes Fanning 's version . Says he : " The whole thing is ridiculous . The only way that the Times could have benefited from the arrangement was for the News to be a whopping success . If they made money , then the Times would share in the profits . There is no motivation for us to want to kill it . " <P> Atwood points out that the News got into deep trouble only when Frederick ( " Ted " ) Field , Kay Fanning 's son by her first marriage to wealthy Chicagoan Marshall Field IV , stopped subsidizing the paper last October . Fanning agrees that the loss of the $500,000 annual subvention was a jolt and that she is seeking that amount to keep the News afloat for a year . But she blames Atwood for most of her current trouble . Says she : " What it comes down to is that the Times has absolute management control with no accountability . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
