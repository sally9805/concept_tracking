The Nixon Watch Pay No More In the federal income tax returns that the President made public on December 8 , as part of what he called " a full disclosure of my financial affairs , " there were three deductions for " depreciation of personally owned White House furniture . " They reduced Mr. Nixon 's taxable income by $1347.36 in 1970 , $1094.73 in 1971 , and $889.47 in 1972 . By- comparison with the items that produced deductions totaling $988,963.43 from a gross income of $1,122,266.39 in the four years 1969-72 , the furniture deductions were trivial . But they and some other relatively minor elements of the President 's tax history seem to me to tell more than the big items do about the attitudes and practices that brought Richard Nixon to the point of assuring the nation at a televised press conference on November 17 that " I am not a crook " and of trying to prove that he is n't with his " full disclosure . " ? One of the pieces of depreciated furniture is the Cabinet table in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West Wing of the White House . It 's a magnificent object , done in black mahogany . Mr. Nixon , dissatisfied with the ' table in use when he was inaugurated , ordered a new table in March of 1969 and paid $4816.84 for it . He said when he did this that he would give the table to the nation when he left the presidency . In the meantime it 's been his property , legally subject to the annually diminishing charge for depreciation that his tax accountant , Arthur Blech of Los Angeles , has claimed on his behalf . The second of two depreciated items is a set of office furniture , and a ludicroUs story is connected with it . As of December 11 , the White House assistants working on the disclosure process did n't know where this furniture was , what it included , or why it was bought . One of the assistants said it could be in the West Wing , across the street in the Executive Office Building , or in presidential office quarters in San Clemente or Key Biscayne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " nobody has gone to the President and asked him about it . " Translated , this meant that nobody had dared to ask the President about it . All that the assistants knew about the set of furniture was thatit included a desk and that the Pavlov Office Furniture Co. , address undetermined , was paid for it in July of 1969 with ' a check for $2369.12 . Although the matter did n't come up at the six press briefings held on December 7 and 8 in connection with the financial disclosure , a spokesman said that the deducted total of $3331.56 in three years on furniture that cost a total of $7185.96 was legal and proper . It was indicated that further deductions could and presumably would be taken . One of the President 's three real estate properties is the Whittier , California home that his mother , Hannah Nixon , owned and occupied when she died . The 1969-72 returns show rental income from this property of $2400.05 and deducted expenses totaling. $26,470.87 over the four years . Its evident use as a tax haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blech , the Los Angeles accountant , said that two Internal ' Revenue Service agents spent more time ? 11 hours ? on this item than on any other when they audited the President 's 1971-72 returns last May . Blech said the Whittier data satisified the agents . He also said that " itlis a question of a very valuable piece of land worth about $90,000 with a building on it worth $8000 . The building is old , dilapidated , very bad , in disrepair . " Newspaper and television pictures showed a two-story , stucco house that seemed to be in decent shape . It generally rents for $50 per month and the annual income has varied from $700 in 1969 to $450 in 1972 . The tenant since October 1972 has been the East Whittier Friends Church ( Quaker ) , to which the President gave $250 in 1969 and $100 in 1971 . These are among the charitable contributions totaling $13,481 over four years and varying from $7512 in 1971 to $295 in 1972 that are reported and deducted on the 1969-72 returns . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his family live in the house and did not appreciate the accountant 's description of it . In 1969 , a typical year , the deducted Whittier loss of $5699.16 included $818.60 in depreciation , $68 for insurance , $1895.65 in property taxes , and the largest item , $3257.14 in interest on a mortgage on the property . Nothing was charged off for maintenance of the house , though a $290 item is marked " clean up . " An intriguing glimpse of Mr. Nixon in one of his personal aspects and of his staff relationships is provided by the references during the disclosure operation to his acquisition in 1967 and sale in early 1969 of 185,891 shares of stock in Fisher 's Island , Inc. , a Miami development company formed and controlled by a group of Nixon friends who include Charles G. ( Bebe ) Rebozo . Reams of rumor and established fact have been printed , much of it unflattering to the President and his associates in this deal and some of it suggesting that Rebozo arranged for Mr. Nixon to be paid much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the principal point of interest here . Mr. Nixon bought 199,891 Fisher shares at $1 a share and sold all but 14,000 shares of his holding back to the Fisher 's Island company for $2 a share . He declared a capital gain of $184,891 in his .1969 return and some of the $72,682.09 that he paid in 1969 income tax was on this gain . It was disclosed on December 8 that three people who worked for Mr. Nixon in 1967 and still work with him took options on the 14,000 shares af$1 per share when he bought his Fisher 's Island stock in 1967 . His personal secretary , Rose Mary Woods , took 10,000 shares . His valet , Manolo Sanchez , took 1000 shares . Patrick Buchanan , a speechwriter and consulting thinker , took 3000 shares . Miss Woods and Sanchez exercised their options in early 1969 and immediately sold their shares back to the company at $2 a share when Mr. Nixon sold his . How Miss Woods and Sanchez financed their 1967 options was not explained . Buchanan told me how he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backed up with a demand note , that six percent interest would be paid when and if the loan was repaid in cash . Buchanan says this was an actual loan , with $3000 passing from him to Mr. Nixon . The President has saidsthat he was earning $100,000 to $250,000 a year with his New York law firm at the time . Buchanan picked up his 3000 optioned shares in 1969 when Mr. Nixon , Sanchez and Miss Woods were selling their shares. , Buchanan says that he kept his shares because he thought it was a good investment . The Fisher 's Island company has offered additional shares at $1 per share since 1969 and Buchanan has bought 820 more at $1 . This fact indicates that Mr. Nixon , Miss Woods and Sanchez got extremely good deals when they sold their shares at $2 . These minor chapters in the big Nixon story bring to mind other small stories about the President . They did n't emerge during the disclosure orgy but are relevant to it . A White House assistant recalls reading a memorandum that the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then his staff counsel in charge of his personal affairs . The assistant says that the memorandum went into much detail about how the President wanted his $200,000 salary , his $50,000 annual expense allowance ? actually a part of his remuneration , subject to income tax to the extent that it is n't spent on official business ? and his other income and assets handled . According to the assistant , who by definition is biased toward Mr. Nixon , it was not the instruction of a man who had anything to hide or who was conscious of doing anything wrong . It was the memorandum of a fairly wealthy man who cared intensely about his money , his family and his heirs , and who wanted his taxes held to the absolute minimum that they could be legally held to . It was the work of a lawyer who was versed in the late Judge Learned Hand 's dictum that nobody is obligated to pay more taxes than the law requires and who interprets this unexceptional doctrine to mean that he and his accountants are entitled to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps the most fascinating item in Mr. Nixon 's 1969-72 returns is the deduction of $1.24 in interest on a department store charge . In that year , 1971 , the President reported $262,384.75 in gross income , claimed $255,676.69 in deductions , and paid $878.03 in federal tax on a re-sported taxable income of $5358.06 . The second story is told by a southern Republican lawyer who visited Mr. Nixon at his New York apartment in 1968 , before he was nominated . Mr. Nixon said he assumed that the lawyer was visiting New York on clients ' business and would charge the trip to them or , at the very least , would deduct the charge on his tax returns as a business expense . The visiting lawyer said he probably would n't ; it really was a personal trip . Mr. Nixon looked as if he were shocked , made the visitor repeat that he did have some clients in New York , and finally extracted an Admission that his visitor could , if he worked at it , concoct a passable excuse for either a charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his right thumb and forefinger at the visitor , winked , and made a chucking sound . The visiting lawyer , telling this story to a partner who told it to me , said he found the episode embarrassing and never afterward had much respect for Richard Nixon . An IRS audit of the President 's 1971-72 tax returns and the fact that it resulted from a random selection of high income and low tax returns became known during the disclosure exercise . It was not officially revealed , but it is a fact , that Internal Revenue Commissioner Johnnie Walters , who has left office since the audit was ordered , was shaken and uncertain when a computer turned up the President 's 1972 return last spring . Walters telephoned a White House assistant and asked him what should be done . The assistant asked whether the law or regulations required the audit of returns selected at random as the President 's was . Walters said an audit was indeed required . Without checking with the President , the assistant told Walters to proceed with the audit . It appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also audited . The significance of this addition to the official story is that a President 's tax returns get special attention but not necessarily special and favored treatment at IRS . This should n't surprise anyone . Mr. Nixon has asked the joint Senate-House Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation to pass upon the legality and propriety of the tax action that worries him most . A $576,000 deduction that he took upon the gift of his vice presidential papers to the national archives in 1969 reduced his taxable income over 196972 by $482,019 and reduced the income taxes that he otherwise would have owed by some $234,000 . The transaction is open to question on several grounds , among them a shortage of documentation of the claim that the gift was effectively made before a 1969 law invalidated such deductions . The uncertainty of the President 's spokesmen about the outcome of this controversy is evident from their strident insistence that Mr. Nixon 's intention to give the nation the papers is clear and that the rest is mere technicality . The rest could involve serious falsifications of fact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one score . His derided story that Lyndon Johnson put him up to the papers dodge is inaccurate in detail but believable in substance . Mr. Johnson took all the tax deductions he could get from gifts of his vice presidential papers and was profanely and extremely aggravated when the 1969 law did him out of a deduction far greater than the ones Mr. Nixon claimed on his 1968 and subsequent incomes . The law did Mr. Johnson out of it , that is to say , because he was wise enough to take some advice that Mr. Nixon either did n't get or ignored . Sheldon Cohen , who was internal revenue commissioner in the Johnson time , told Mr. Johnson that he could beat the deadline if he insisted but would be foolish to try it . Mr. Nixon tried it and is in trouble . The President who signed that 1969 law , incidentally , was Richard Nixon .
