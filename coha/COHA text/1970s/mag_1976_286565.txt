Wall Streeters are accustomed to it . <P> As each new year begins , stock prices generally rally at least slightly , rebounding from the December sell-offs when investors dumped lackluster shares to establish losses for tax purposes . What happened last week , however , far surpassed the usual January flurry : with a powerful surge , the stock market leaped into the new year . On each day last week , prices successively chalked up solid to spectacular gains , adding a total of 52.42 points to the Dow Jones industrial average . That barometer broke through the psychologically important 900 mark to close the week at 911.13 . <P> Though that is still far below the all-time high of 1051.70 in January 1973 , brokers were delighted that the Dow has at last jumped above the 820-to-869 range in which it had been mired for five months . Said John J. Smith , partner in the brokerage house of Fahnestock &; Co. : " The market has finally broken out on the upside , encouraging the bulls . " <P> Broadly Based . The rally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished in some of the heaviest trading ever . Turnover on the New York Stock Exchange one day reached 33 million shares , the third highest on record . For all last week volume totaled 141,948,050 shares , the second highest trading week in history . <P> A large number of trades in blocks of 10,000 shares or more indicated that institutional investors-mutual funds , pension funds , trusts-that had been on the sidelines had strongly re-entered the market . Furthermore , just about all categories of stocks profited from the upsurge . On one day , advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by seven-to-one . Among the big gainers : Du Pont ( 11% points ) , General Electric ( 4 points ) , Procter &; Gamble ( 5% points ) and U.S. Steel ( 5% points ) . <P> Taken aback by the suddenness of the market 's revival , some analysts fear that the rally has driven prices above appealing levels , and that a downturn must come . Indeed , it would be astonishing if prices did not slip back soon , at least temporarily , after shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view on Wall Street , however , is that stocks are entering a second stage of a major bull market that , in the opinion of followers of the Dow theory , began unmistakably a year ago . Though the second stage of a bull market usually is characterized by a somewhat more cautious advance than the first , some analysts are predicting that the Dow Jones average could again test 1000 before year 's end . Says Harold Jane way , a senior vice president of White , Weld &; Co. : " We are not in a runaway bull market with all the speculative trimmings , but we certainly are in a positive environment .
