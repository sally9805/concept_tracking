he has them , they would follow him anywhere , he has them help-less  --  " Sabra could not take her eyes from the flailing , writhing figure on the platform . Was the man possessed ? Surely he was right , the world was wicked , it would end in the thunderclap of doom . The cloud passed , the sun blazed down again : she felt the flames of Hell . Father Miller fell to his knees . The mass of gyrating flesh before him crumpled in imitation . Automatically Sabra moved to follow , but she felt Silas grip her arm , hold her back . " No , " he said . He held her very tight , she felt his strong hand through the thin stuff of her sleeve . She looked at him and felt her terror subside . His dark eyes smiled at her ; his familiar bearded face was calm and strong . " You have nothing to repent of , Sabra . Pray if you must , but do not kneel . You will stain your dress . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The crowd groveled , waiting . The sky darkened again ; a few drops of rain began to fall . FatherMiller prayed : " 0 Lord we beseech Thee ... " " Come on , " whispered Silas . He let go her arm and seized the basket and took her hand as they pushed their way through the crowd . " Any minute now , " he said , glancing up at the thick-piled clouds . He pulled her along . " In here . " They ducked quickly into one of the small tents at the edge of the encampment . It was crammed with crude beds , straw pallets , hand trunks , a snoring mongrel dog in one corner , a makeshift table littered with dirty dishes and Adventist tracts . Sabra was dizzy : the heat , the excitement , had reduced her to a conditionof trance . She was aware that she was trembling again ; she was aware that outside this dim and noisome canvas the sudden summer rain had become a downpour ; she was aware that had she not now leaned against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the preacher 's voice : " For we are all lost sheep , 0 Lord , and we beseech Thee . . .

Stand up , she thought . She felt his hands on her arms : pushing her away ? No : supportingher . He was trembling also . Stand straight , she thought , and move away . He smelled of sweat and starch . She wanted to lean against him forever . " . . . for we are all damned , 0 Lord , all lost to Thee if Thee willnot save us . . She lifted her head and saw his face . Why so sad , why despairing ? His arms went tight around her . Fainting , falling . He revived her . Save me 0 Lord.  |p201Josiah  Bradshaw put out his hand . When his fingers touched the cutglassdecanter he grasped it firmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained ; then he poured briefly into his glass . Carefully he replaced the decanter on the table beside him . Carefully he lifted the glass to his lips and drank . Thunder rolled down the river valley . Through the tall windows he could see the flicker of lightning . The day had been unbearably hot ; sitting in his pew that morning he had wondered how Dr. Edson had managed to deliver his sermon without fainting . Margaret , sitting beside him , had mopped her face quite openly  --  an unladylike thing to do , an unsuitableexample for the other women in the pews behind them . An exceptionally bright flash illuminated the room : his room , his library , his private place . He sat there often now , late into the night , not to read or work , for he seldom lit a lamp : but to hold that decanter and lift it to fill his glass and drink and fill the glass again . It had become a ritual : home for supper after last bell , a hurried silent meal with Margaretand Lydia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today was Sunday he had come here early ; tha sun had not yet sunk behind the western hills when he had closed the door behind him and entered into what had become his refuge . In a little while  --  later , later  --  he would go upstairs and lie down beside his wife and sink into unconsciousness . He never tried to see if she were awake . He heard the bells down in the city strike eleven , a faint peal , far away . For a moment his mind pictured the sleeping town : streets and streets lined with houses , rooms and rooms filled with bodies , all sleeping . Thousands of females , who before dawn tomorrow would arise and go out into the mills and begin another day 's work to increase the profits of the Corporations . And of all those thousands , he thought bitterly , he had chosen the one who was flawed . Any one of them  --  the poorest , the most humble  --  could have accomplished what Margaret could not ; any one of them could have given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last swallow from his glass  --  he had chosen wrongly , had allowed himself , driven by his passions , to take that one who had so enchanted him that he had never dreamed that for all her promise she would be barren . As barren as his heart ; as empty as his life . Divorce was impossible : unthinkable . The Associates who had broughtp202him here sixteen  --  no , seventeen  --  years ago had been very firm about the conditions . They had taken him on as Agent because he was the son of an old friend of theirs , but they would keep him , they said , only if he behaved himself and caused no scandal . It had been a near thing with Rachel , but the disruption caused by Mayor Lawrence 's death had divertedeveryone 's attention and no one had discovered  --  or gossiped about  --  her misbehavior . Old Hale , the instigator , had mercifully died not long after . And whatever business there had been between Sophia and that weak reed of Blood 's had been safely aborted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must keep up his respectable facade . A divorce  --  and on what grounds , after all ?  --  would so seriously impair his authority that he would be powerless to control the increasingly restless operatives . And he must keep control ; there must be no turnouts , no slowdowns . The price of cotton goods had dropped alarmingly in the past year : a yard of calico which twelve months ago had sold for twenty cents now went at fifteen , and the price was falling still . Unless more cloth was produced and sold , the shareholders ' profits would drop . They would not stand for it . They would dismiss him and find someone who could extract the work from the girls . The new system of premium payments to overseers whose workers produced extra yardage was working tolerably well , but if the demands from Boston continued , he doubted if even premiums would suffice . Already Ten Hours had become a byword in the town ; just this past week he had dismissed three operatives for circulating petitions . One girl  --  Rudd was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she had not protested her dismissal , but she had begged him not to blacklist her . In the end he had had to call on two second hands to put her forcibly out of his office ; the scene had given him a migraine which had lasted until he had had two glasses of whiskey that night . He lifted his head . A sound had intruded  --  not the distant explosions of the thunder , but something more immediate , something here in the house . Surely not a Camp Lander  --  although they grew bolder by the day , preying on citizens who lived within striking distance in town , making their quick haul and scurrying back to their dens in the Acre before the constable could be summoned . But Belvidere Hill was too far ; they would not venture across the Concord River Bridge . He told himself once again to hire another couple to replace the Gumms . When they had died of fever within a week of each other at the New Year , Margaret had been reluctant to take on new servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maclver is willing to help , we do n't need anyone else . Somehow the house had been kept in order , the floors swept , the meals prepared . Iie had been aware that the burden of the  |p203only  after the meal had been served . But she had not complained , and so , thankful to be spared the extra expense , he had deferred to Margaret'swishes . He had not thought to wonder why she wanted no hired help . But now , alarmed , he wished that there were another man in the house . He tensed , listening ; he heard a soft chord , and then another ; an off-key voice attempting to sing : 0 that I saw her just once ' ere she died ... . Annoyed , he stood up , steadied himself , and walked out of his library and down the hall to the parlor . In the glow of a candle he saw his sister-in-law at the piano . She was wearing her night-dress ; her gray hair hung untidily down around her face . Although he had walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her eyes were vacant ; she did not seem to recognize him . " Now , Amalia , " he said , " go upstairs . You 'll wake Lydia and Margaret if you play the piano now . You can sing tomorrow . " His words were surprisinglyclear ; often when he had drunk a good amount he could not enunciate at all . Miss Amalia shook her head . " No , " she said , quite loud . " She does n't let me . " It was true ; he knew it , but he did not wish to think about it . He did not wish to be bothered with domestic difficulties . " I will speak to her , " he said soothingly . " Now come to bed . It is very late . " " No , " she said , as loudly as before . " I can not sleep . The thunder woke me . Josiah  --  " Her eyes slid over him , then caught his and held . He looked away . She was a plain woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  did you hear it ? " " Hear what ? " He heard his voice : still clear . But he was terribly tired . He wanted only to go upstairs and lie down and sleep . " The piano . " " I heard you , yes . " " No . No . I mean before . " He saw a tear slide down her cheek . How old she is , he thought suddenly . An old woman . Yet once she had been only five years older than Sophia ; how had she come to this ? " No , Amalia , I heard nothing before . You were dreaming , perhaps " " No . I was not " Her voice cracked with the urgency of her thought . " I heard it . The thunder awakened me and then I heard it . Someone playing , someone singing  --  " " There was no one , Amalia . " " Yes . I heard her . I came down to find her . "  | " Who ? " He leaned against the carved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could rest " Her . She was singing , just as she used to do . I heard her .

She is not at peace , Josiah . I heard her . She wanted something . She is here now , but we can not see her . She is watching us , I feel her eyes  --  Sophia ! " She rose unsteadily from the piano bench and peered into the dark corners of the room . Slowly , haltingly , she began to walk , her hands outstretched . " Sophia ! What is it , dearest ? What do you want ? " I am dreaming now myself , thought Bradshaw . This can not be . She is mad , the work is too much for her , we must get Dr. Knight to see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal  --  frightenedof what she would find , yet longing for it : " Sophia ! I am here ! Please come ! " She stumbled against a chair , righted herself , and resumed her journey . Her tear-stained face was all expectant , her eyes wide to catch a glimpse of her heart 's desire . " Sophia ? " With an effort Bradshaw steadied himself and reached out and caught her arm as she came toward him . " Amalia ! Stop it ! She is gone , she can not come back ! " For a moment , still caught up in her search , she did not seem to hear him . Then she looked anxiously into his eyes . " What ? " " She is gone , Amalia . You were dreaming . She is dead . She can not come back . " Bitter words  --  bitter truth . She heard him ; she understood . The hope faded from her face ; her body slumped . Slowly she shook her head . " I thought I heard  --  " " A dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let go her arm ; automatically she began to massage the place where his fingers had hurt her . " Come , now . Upstairs . It is very late . " She stood quite still beside him . " A dream " " Yes . Now come . " He touched her shoulder lightly , as if to reassure her . She started ; she turned her ravaged face up to him . " She is dead , Josiah . " " Yes " " She is dead three years " " Yes . " " Dead and buried . " " Yes . " " In the cold ground . The worms eat her flesh , her bones laid bare  --  "  | " Stop it , Amalia . " " Dead ! " She stepped back quickly , recoiling from him as if he were Beelzebub . " You killed her , Josiah . She is dead  --  and you killed her ! " He felt his heart lurch . The woman was mad " Yes ! As surely as if you put a knife through her heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He struck her and watched the dark place stain her cheek where his hand had hit . She began to laugh . " Never . Never . You will never have it . Never . God is good , God is just , you are paid for your crime . You will never have it . You will grow old and die and your name will die with you . You are fit to breed only women  --  women ! Never will you have a son , Josiah ! " Her breath came in hard spasms ; her body trembled as if a demon engine had started up inside her . He turned and left the room . Either that , he thought , or strike her again . Silence behind him , silence upstairs : it seemed impossible that they had not been overheard . He was sorry for Lydia : this was not what he had wanted for her . The door to his bedroom was shut . Softly he opened it ; as he stepped inside , a bright flash illuminated the room . He saw the figure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her eyes were open . He stood beside the bed . He remembered how , once , even a brief glimpse of her body bending over her loom had aroused him . Now he felt nothing . Her failure to conceive , even though he knew that the fault was hers , had deadened all his natural impulses . He could hardly remembereven the feeling of desire . I will have him , he thought . Beside him his wife turned away , presentingher back . Damn them all , he thought ; I will have him . From some other woman , if necessary : but I will have him . In matters of intimate relations between himself and members of the gentle sex , Silas Blood was , in practice , a celibate . In theory , he very warmly espoused the sexual doctrines of Robert Dale Owen : limiting the birth rate was the solution to all the world 's ills , and the way to limit it was by the withdrawal of the male organ prior to ejaculation . Silas thought it a wonderful idea ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Moral Physiology ; or , a Brief and Plain Treatise on the Population Question , " and had been comforted to know that wiser heads than his had wrestled with this problem and found a solution to it . To have allowed himself to be so weak as to permit even one drop of the critical fluid to enter into a female would have been , to him , an unforgivable lapse . Mr. Owen , in his wisdom , preached this way to all who would hear : self-denial was unnecessary , consideration for the opposite sex allimportant . Chivalry , to Mr. Owen , was the key ; chivalry , and stern vigilance . For females so unlucky as to encounter selfish or undisciplined men , Mr. Owen had only reproach : consort with true gentlemen , he said , and you will be safe . Although you are the vessels of reproduction , you must consign to us the power over your lives . Rest assured that no gentleman would even dream of so inconveniencing a lady , so endangering her life in return for her favors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , you may ascribe that loss to the intoxication of your innumerablecharms and so salvage some comfort from the debacle of an unwantedpregnancy . Silas was a great admirer of Mr. Owen 's father : an industrialist who had tried in his native Scotland to improve the lives of his operatives , who had seen and attempted to ameliorate the evils of the factory system , who had expended his fortune in an attempt to establish his vision of the good life at New Harmony  --  that ill-starred enterprise in Indiana whose failure surely was no fault of Robert Owen 's . His experience was a valuable lesson to all who would imitate him : be certain of your followers , trust none but the proven hearts . In September , Silas and Winfield began a long tour : through Worcesterand Springfield ( with a visit to the generous manufacturer ) , through Troy and Albany and down the Hudson to Poughkeepsie , to New-York and thence through the Middle Atlantic states . By stage and railway car and packet boat they traveled ; on hope and promise they lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fifty-seven applicationsto join the Community when it began . They were encouraged ; they were optimistic . Weary travelers slogging toward the Promised Land , they saw all about them the first tantalizing landmarks of their destination : the hard cash underpinning , the firm promises of support so necessary to their success . Silas saw many pretty women on the way . Some of them spoke to him in the evenings after Winfield 's lecture , or as members of welcoming committees when the speech had had sufficient advance publicity . He understood his attraction for them . They were lonely in their native towns , they were unmarried , without hope of marriage . He understood that to them he seemed a figure of enormous interest ; after a while he came to expect the attention which they gave to him , the sweet smiles ,  |p207the  fluttering lashes , the eager questions intended to draw him out , to make of him a special friend . But he never allowed himself to be caught . In a quiet corner of his mind , he kept the memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laboring as he labored , waiting and hoping as he did for the day when the Community would begin . Had he analyzed his feelings for her , he might yet have proved to be the son of Enoch Blood , Esq .  --  for she had no money but her small wages , she had no position , no help to offer him save her devotion and her honest heart . But he thought of none of that : he thought only that he loved her , and that once , in a cluttered tent at an Adventist campground , he had kissed her , and that that one embrace had bound them for all time , each to the other . For she was no less a lady because she worked in a factory , and he no less a gentleman because he espoused the Communal life . And so for her sake as well as his own  --  how he loved to chain himself to an ideall  --  he resisted the charms of other women ; he wrote to her twice a month ; he looked forward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winfield 's Eden , and practice on her to his honorable heart 's content the prudent sexual teachings of Robert Dale Owen . Sabra lived through the autumn in a haze of anticipatory daydreams . No longer was she one of the unchosen . In the weeks of late summer , before he left on his travels with Winfield , Silas had come regularly from Concord to see her . He became a familiar face to the denizens of Mrs. Clapham 's boarding house ; that good lady herself , in the joy of seeing yet another of her girls make good  --  that is , snare a man  --  had taken , so she coyly declared , to setting her clock by him , so punctually did he appear every Sunday . Had she known of the exact nature of Silas ' plans for himself and Sabra , Mrs. Clapham would have been somewhat less enthusiastic about his visits . For if Silas followed Robert Dale Owen on birth control , he followed Henry Winfield on marriage  --  and marriage , said Winfield , was the old way : the enslavement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to experiment , to move on , to form new partnerships when the old had grown stale . In Winfield 's Community there would be no traditionalmarriages ; each couple wishing to unite would sign a contract which could be torn up  --  dissolved  --  at the wish of either . Winfield would say a few words at a Community ceremony , and a couple would be united . They could part with equal ease . Silas had explained Winfield 's philosophy  --  but not Owen 's  --  to Sabra on his last visit before his departure . In the face of his eloquence , his devotionto Winfield 's way , she had thought it an admirably sensible plan ; but she had thought , too , that her fellow boarders , not to mention Mrs. Clapham , would doubtless think it foolish at the least , and wicked at worst . So she was noncommittal when they asked her about her plans top208marry : when we can , she said . When the Community is begun . She saw herself there , free of the burden of factory labor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ! His letters gave her infinite consolation . She often thought , reading them , of her terror on the day of Father Miller 's exhibition . She had been very foolish  --  misguided , to tremble with fear at his warning of the Apocalypse . Surely this world would end  --  this world of endless drudging work , of wage slavery , of dictatorship by a few rich men . Father Miller had been right about that . But the end would come , not in a consummation of fire , but in the gift of new sight given to all men and women by the labors of Silas Blood , among others . Father Miller and his acolytes , exhorting in their error , served only to distract people 's minds from the truth : that the salvation would come here , on earth , for everyone ; not in that select Heaven whose doors were open only to those terrorized enough to confesstheir sins . And so she saw now with Silas ' eyes : and she saw the evils of the factorysystem . She heard with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machinery , the impotent , discontented grurnblings of her sister operatives , powerless to prevent their own exploitation . His mind , his thought became her own ; and so , fortified with new perception , she thought that she understood the error of life as it was generally lived . With the zeal of the convert , she embraced the need for a new way . She saw that the malcontents who were exhorting Ten Hours labored in darkness . Ten Hours was meaningless  --  an irrelevance . Ten Hours assumed that the factory system must continue , when in fact the only hope for them all was the return to the land , the growth of true community , the self-sufficient enclave fashioned on the principles of true equality  --  men and women , rich and poor , Christian and nonbeliever . In her new enlightenment , she saw that Betsey Rudd , discharged and blacklisted for her Ten-Hour agitation , had sacrificed her job for nothing . Where was she now ? How did she live ? Sabra remembered that Betsey had come from Goshen , a village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , asking her to think about joining the Community . She was sure that Silas would not object , for Betsey was the very best type of girl : hard-working , honest , bright and kind . After some days she had an answer . Nov. 15 , ' 42Dear Sabra , Thanks for your letter , and for asking me to join Mr. Winfield 's Community . It sounds too good to be true , and you are lucky to be going there.  |p209My  mother has been ill , and my sister also . So I will need to stay here for a while  --  I do n't know how long . I 'll let you know if I can get away next spring , but I ca n't leave now . I miss you all , and I certainly miss my pay . I could n't earn a dollar here to save my soul . I do n't see many people . It 's hard to get into the village because Father sold our trap last month . But I read when I can , and hope my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what I did . Let me have news of you and everyoneagain soon . Your letter cheered me very much . Your friend , BetseyFor two weeks after Betsey left , Sabra had the bed to herself . It was the longest time that anyone in the house could remember a place being vacant ; usually a new girl appeared within a day or two to take the place of the one who had gone . But they had heard , with increasing frequency , of the Corporations ' difficulty in finding new help . The recruiters  --  the slavers  --  journeyed to the far north country now to fill their long black wagons with new hands , and they were given a bonus of a dollar a head for every girl whose home was more than a hundred miles distant from the factories . But , of late , girls were not so eager to snatch at the chance for life away from the lonely drudgery of the farms . There was drudgery , too , on the Corporation , they had heard ; the overseers and Agents were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come here , they heard , you have a new master , but a master all the same ; and you risk your health , even your life , to earn your pittance . Even though it is more than you or any woman ever earned before , you must understand the difficulties you face in getting it . " Have you talked to her ? " said Minerva , several days after a new girl had finally arrived to take Betsey 's place . " No more than to say good night . What of her ? " Minerva had lingered unusually long that evening at the supper table . She sat now with Sabra , picking at the last of her plum tart ; she seemed tired  --  discouraged . She had just received a manuscript returned from the third publisher to whom she had sent it . A book , not a story  --  three hundredpages of laboriously written plot , each page representing the loss of at least half an hour 's sleep . For all her work , all her fatigue , Minerva remained plump and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have guessed that she was as fiercely intent on her purpose as , say , the Ten-Hour agitators were on theirs . " Ask her where she comes from , " said Minerva . " She will not tell you at first . She may not tell you at all , but I gather that she is not what she pretends to be . "  | " Why ? " said Sabra . " What has she to conceal ? " " I 'm not sure . " Minerva 's round face settled into an expression of gloom . " But I think  --  and it 's only a suspicion , mind you-I think that she has  --  uh  --  lived a life that most of us would rather die than live . I think that her reputation was in some way compromised  --  " " Does Mrs. Clapham know ? " " Of course not . Do you think she 'd let her stay on if there were the slightest question about her character ? " " What will you do ? " she said . " Will you tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Minerva . " In fact I probably wo n't need to tell her at all . The girl will show herself for what she is , sooner or later . She has not adjusted well ; I am sure that she will not stay . The discipline is too confining for her . She will go back to what she came from . " She shuddered ; her fertile imagination allowed her fully to imagine the horrorsof which she spoke . " She will be ground up in the wheels of the world , " she said ; and , liking the phrase , she repeated it to herself . An idea had just come to her : why not a story about such a girl ?  --  if she could write it in a sufficiently genteel way , of course , for the public would not stand for any salacious material from the pen of a woman . Filled with new purpose , she pushed back her chair and stood up . " I 'm going to work now , " she said . " What are you doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabra . She wished that she could say : " I am writingto Silas , " but his itinerary was unplanned , she had no idea of his addresson any given day . " I 'm tired , " she said . " Perhaps I 'll go to bed . I 'll say one thing for that new girl : she 's a quiet sleeper . " Mr. A. P. Critchlow , the overseer in the weaving room of the CommonwealthNumber Two , had had a difficult day . In the morning he had been summoned to Bradshaw 's office , where , to his dismay , he had been informed of the new premium system which was to go into effect immediately : a dollar a head for him for each girl who produced ten yards a week more . The extra money would be helpful , Mrs. Critchlow having recently given birth to their sixth child , but he dreaded the means by which he must obtain it . The girls had been quiet these last months , since winter was always a quiet time . Spring and summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands to train . They might not remain docile with this new announcement . And if they took it into their heads to protest  --  to turn out  --  he , A. P. Critchlow , would be blamed for not being able to keep his girls in line . Their conduct , both within and withoutthe mill , reflected on him as well as on the Agent ; he was always alert for news of them , he always asked around at the houses . He felt it his duty to know what they did with themselves at all times ; he was very conscious of the need to maintain a high moral tone . He had delayed his announcement of the order until after the noon bell which brought the girls back from their dinners ; then , weakening , he delayed again . How he hated himself at such times ! They were only women , after all . He earned six or seven times as much as the best of them . They could never advance , no matter how able they were : the best weaver in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he , Amasa Prout Critchlow , could aspire to  --  well , not to an Agent 's post , he had not the proper family connections for that  --  but at least to sub-agent , the Agent 's surrogate with a dozen men under him . Knowing all this , confident of his superior place in the God-ordained hierarchy , he hesitated still . He shuddered to think what would happen if they ever came together strongly enough to turn out all at once ; certainlyhis position would be taken from him , at the very least . At worst he would be blacklisted like any operative . No mill in New England would hire him as an overseer if it were put about that he could not control his girls . It was the girls whom everyone came to see . He thought it a bad thing , this celebration of female weavers and spinners . It went to their heads ; he could see the secret look of pride on their faces when a delegationcame through . No one ever looked at A. P. Critchlow on such occasions ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agent , he would never allow a single visitor into the building . In the afternoon a harness strap had broken on one of the looms . Worse , no mechanic was immediately available to repair it ; not before tomorrow , came word from the machine shop . Critchlow chafed and fumed . Since the beginning of the railroad , seven years ago , the machine shop had become increasingly less useful to the factories . As hundreds of new miles of track were added every year , hundreds of new locomotives and cars had to be built to traverse them . Thus the mechanics at the machineshop were less frequently available to repair a broken loom or spinning frame . In some of the mills , he knew , the condition of the machineryhad become a scandal ; one girl in the Hamilton Number Three , tired of waiting for her loom to be repaired , had attempted to become something of a mechanic herself , to the vast amusement of her overseer . And now , just before the evening supper hell , two warp threads  --  improperly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken and she hadp212spent a good ten minutes trying to re-tie them . At the first peal of the bell the operatives threw the handles to stop their looms and raced for the stairway ; Sabra Palfrey , he saw with some surprise , remained behind , still drawing up the thread in an attempt to get a full warp . He approached her softly in the sudden quiet . He was pleased to see that she started when he appeared at her side . What was it someone had said about her ? " Dangerous company , Mr. Critchlow , the girl kept dangerouscompany last summer  --  and unchaperoned , too . " He was not sure exactly what dangerous company was , but it bore looking into . " Trouble , Sabra ? Here , let me see . " As he leaned over the tautly strung yarn he brushed her shoulder . Instinctivelyshe drew back . He felt a warning excitement begin to stir somewhere in the depths of his small torso . Since she made no reply he continued in a friendly way as he pulled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is weak all the way along , spun out badly , this kind of thread 'll break no matter how you dress it , you just have to pull it out until you see it 's even all along  --  " He glanced at her as he worked ; she stood impassive , watching his hands . " There . That 'll do , it 's strong from this point . Now you can tie it on . " He straightened , automatically running his hand over his head to smooth his thinning hair . Obediently Sabra chalked her fingers and leaned to tie the thread . She was aware that he was standing close  --  too close  --  but she ignored him . She did not like him ; she had stayed , not to please him , but to save herselffrom staying late to finish . Better to miss supper than to stay after last bell ; besides , she was not hungry . It was a bad night . Wind-driven snow beat against the tall windows facing the river ; she did not miss having to battle her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that after she repaired the broken threads she would sit for a while on the stairs and rest her back until the bell sounded for the girls to return . Critchlow stood between her and the aisle . As she finished tying she muttered a word of thanks and stepped to one side to get out . He stepped , too , as if he were her partner in a dance . His movement blockingher way was as eloquent as any improper word : instantly they understoodeach other . " Sabra  --  " " Excuse me . " She refused to meet his eyes . She stood quite still . The whale-oil lamps ringing the walls threw harsh shadows across the floor , angular black patterns . The snow melted on the windows . The room was very warm ; Sabra felt the perspiration on her face , but she did not try to wipe it off.  |p213Any  movement now seemed an admission of defeat , or at least of weakness . She must stand her ground . But no . There was an escape , after all . She turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows . She could get out that way . Surely he would not follow her . She felt his hand on her arm . A lifetime of instruction  --  to be obedient , docile , ladylike , gentle  --  inhibited her instinctive reaction . He was surprised at her submissiveness ; he was surprised at his own temerity . The fact that she did not shake him off emboldened him ; the feel of her arm beneath his hand , thin , firm , yet soft , sent an imperious signal to his brain . What they said was true : she was a loose one . Any decent girl would have put him off immediately . He retained his grip and backed her into the frame of the loom behind her . He put his free hand on her neck , not to strangle , but to press against the life-throbbing pulse . He crowded her , felt the outline of her body beneath her uncrinolined skirts . He felt his own body respond . His wife would not be available for weeks . It was not right for him to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His breath smelled of tobacco and onions , his mouth was an obscene opening in his tight little face . " Stop it  --  " Her spine was crushed against the metal frame . She pulled at his hand on her neck . He tightened his grip and pushed himself harder against her . " Now , miss . " He grimaced . His teeth were pale brown . A drop of spittlehit her cheek . " I 've been hearing about you . People say you 're a sly thing . What does that mean , eh ? " " Get away  --  " No use ; he had her fast . " You know we ca n't keep no one who do n't behave herself . Corporationca n't have a bad name , can it ? Now why do n't you tell me what it is you did with that fella  --  " His stinking mouth came close . Violently she wrenched her head away . Her struggle excited him unbearably . " Little minx , ai n't you ? Now if you 'll just quiet down perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to discharge you . I always had a liking for you , Sabra  --  " Scream , she thought . She fought down her rising nausea . Get away  --  " Mr. Critchlow ! " She felt him freeze . In a second he had released her and stepped back , looking for the source of that voice which , so providential had it been , might have been the voice of God Himself but which was only Josiah Bradshaw come to confer with his overseer . The Agent stood in the aisle , disgust and disbelief struggling on his face . Critchlow , with the air of a small boy who has been caught with hisp214hand in the candy jar  --  not a grave offense , surely ?  --  turned to face his employer . " What is the matter here ? " Bradshaw glanced at Sabra but did not acknowledgeher presence . " Ah  --  a little trouble with the threads , sir , but it 's all fixed now . " He attempteda smile . Bradshaw 's eyes traveled down him and up again . Stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was a decent girl , after all . " Sabra ? " " The warp threads broke , and I stayed to tie them . " Sabra 's friendship with Silas Blood had not yet come to Bradshaw 's attention : what was common knowledge in the town did not always reach the ears of those who purportedly controlled that town . Had he known of it , he might have been less willing to assume her innocence in this case ; but since he knew nothing , his outrage was all for Critchlow . They heard the bell calling the operatives back to work . With an abrupt movement of his head , Bradshaw beckoned the overseer to follow him downstairs . Left alone for a moment until the other girls returned , Sabra moved her body cautiously . Nothing seemed broken . She rubbed the sore place on her back where Critchlow had pressed her against the loom . Were it not for that pain , she might have thought the past minutes nothing but a brief hallucination brought on by fatigue , hunger , loneliness  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trembling . To go away , to leave this endless labor , to live at peace in some quiet country home  --  soon , she thought . Soon the Community will begin , and I can go away and have my life . She heard footsteps on the stairs , the sound of voices rising . She turned and went to her place . By seven-thirty that evening , when the operatives were dismissed for the day , the snow had stopped and here and there a star shone in the cloudy night sky . Bradshaw shrugged on his greatcoat , picked up his tall black beaver hat , and , stepping out into the mill yard , locked his office and called good night to the watch . As he passed through the gate and climbed into his waiting cutter , he saw the last of the operatives scurry/ing into their boarding houses . He felt a brief sympathy for the hapless Critchlow . Driving past the boarding houses and seeing the shapeless forms hurrying inside , he admitted to himself that Critchlow 's misconduct  --  andcertainly it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To be surrounded every day by such numbers of females , to work with them , talk to them , smell their scent as they passed , see their pleasing forms bent to their tasks  --  the strange thing was that incidents such as today 's did not happen more frequently . A man was only human , after all , no matter how hard he might try to deny it . Bradshaw thought of his own infatuation with his present wife . Did Critchlow have such a desire for Sabra , he wondered ? Or , starved as he was because of his wife 's frequent confinements , would he have behaved so with any girl ? He turned the horse down Merrimack Street toward the great bend in the river , away from the direction of his own house . He was expected this evening at the home of Matthew Munson , whose devotion to the cause of the Corporations had frequently to be rewarded , among other ways , by the presence of the manufacturing hierarchy at his table . Tonightwould be a gathering of gentlemen whom Munson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation in the coming session of the Great and General Court , where he so faithfully warmed his seat in the interests of his benefactors . To Bradshaw 's left lay the Acre : alien ground . He reminded himself to mention to his host the possibility of restricting immigration , say , by a legislative decree . Probably such a thing was not possible  --  but certainly it seemed desirable , with new arrivals flooding the port of Boston daily , making their wretched way to other cities of the Commonwealth . Only last week two Irishwomen had applied for positions in the spinning room , when everyone knew that Irish were fit only to pick waste . The recruiters in the north country had not sent down enough hands in the last six months , and Bradshaw had been momentarily tempted to hire the applicants . The overseer had appealed to the Agent to make the decision : " They seem decent enough , sir , but I do n't know . The girls wo n't like it . " Finally he had refused them . They could hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would not be operatives of whom he could boast that they were as genteel as any lady  --  like the Offering girls , for instance . He had been rewarded for his prudence the next day by the delivery of ten new American girls from whom to choose . It would be a bad day indeed , he thought grimly , when he was forced to hire foreign help because no native girls would apply . He turned left onto Pawtucket Street , which ran parallel to the river above the bend . Munson 's house was a gaudy new yellow affair of pointed gables and elaborately carved , white-painted trim ; it looked like nothing so much as a setting for one of the stories In Lydia 's book ofp216German fairy tales . Bradshaw 's aesthetic sensibilities were offended by that house : he was a plain man , heart and soul . The housekeeper admitted him and showed him into the parlor , where Munson entertained two earlier arrivals : Bright , of the Hamilton , and Trask , of the Massachusetts . He exchanged greetings and stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host a cup of hot flip . It was badly flavored ; it lacked sufficient rum . He sighed and resigned himself to the evening , thinking longingly of his quiet room on Belvidere Hill . The discussion at dinner centered on the question of a bill before the legislature to end imprisonment for debt . What line , Munson wanted to know , did the Corporations wish him to take ? He could make a speech in favor of the bill if they wished ; then again , he could oppose it . They had only to tell him what to do . The conversation droned on through the meal . At last , after they had done , Bradshaw sat back to enjoy his cigar . But it did not taste good , neitherit nor his glass of port . Nothing had , he realized , for a long time . He ate , he slept , he went through his days like a well-tended machine , poweredby  --  what ? He had been staring at his glass while the others pursuedthe discussion . Now he raised his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes of one of the servants who was clearing the dishes from the opposite side of the table . He realized that she had been staring at him ; now , when he met her glance , her pale face colored a little and after a moment she looked down , attentive once more to her work . A frank stare is a personal , intimate thing . Bradshaw was accustomed to a more obsequious manner , especially from females , most especially from female servants . He had felt curiously exposed , for an instant , under those eyes ( very blue , black-lashed ; a pretty face , too ) . There had been nothing impertinent about her look ; it was simply a recognition , as if she had said  --  would have said , had she had the chance  --  " I know you . " She did , in fact , know him . He had once given Patrick O'Haran a fivedollargold-piece . Patrick had it still ; he had let her see it once , although he had not told her why Bradshaw had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all was enough to place him forever in her own private hierarchyof persons to be admired , along with Mrs. Clapham and Sabra Palfreyand Mary McCormic and , of course , Patrick himself . She wished that she could speak to this tall , impressive , powerful man who sat at Mr. Munson 's table and ate and talked and yet seemed curiously detached from the company , not paying attention . But of course to speak to him would have been unthinkable unless he spoke first . She wished that he would ; she was sure that she would have been brave enough to answer . But he did not : he simply met her gaze , and for an instant , no more , some wordless message had passed between them ; and then she hadp217bent her head again and continued with her work and the gentlemen had retired to the parlor to continue their political discussion . For all its brevity the moment stayed with Bradshaw through the rest of the evening at Munson 's and all during his long journey home . He had felt those eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet he had not minded , had not taken offense . It was an odd moment to take away , but not an unpleasant one . He turned into his driveway ; after stabling his horse he made his way around to the front door of his house . And opened it , and staggered again under the burden of his life . A low , wailing voice  --  like the chant of some savage , he thought  --  assaultedhis ears . It appeared to come from the second floor . The rooms downstairs were dark , unoccupied . After listening for a moment to make sure that the voice did in fact come from within the house , he ran up the stairs and then , following the sound , down the hall to Miss Maelver 's room  --  formerly his sister-in-law 's . A sliver of light fell onto the hall carpet . He pushed open the door . " Amalia ? " He saw a tableau : three figures . Sitting at one side of the bed , his wife Margaret . Bending over on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the object of their attentions : Amalia . Several lamps gave a pitiless illumination to the scene ; a fire burned high in the small fireplace . A nauseous smell filled the air . He stepped inside the room . The wailing had stopped at the sound of his voice ; he guessed that it had come from Miss MacIver . " What is it ? What happened ? " As he stepped closer to the bed he saw that a dribble of dark fluid ran down Amalia 's chin ; her face was as white as the pillowcase , her eyes sunken , half closed . She lay as still as Death . It was his wife who answered his question . " She took something , we think . We do n't know what . She 's been vomiting , unconscious  --  " Swiftly he brushed her aside and took Amalia 's wrist . He felt a faint pulse . " What have you given her ? Where is Dr. Knight ? " " We tried to get her to swallow an infusion of lobelia , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We found her in the kitchen . It was all we could do to get her up the stairs . The doctor  --  " " The doctor is at home , I assume , " snapped Margaret . " We discovered her only an hour ago , and since it is such a bitter night , and only the two of us here aside from the child , we thought you would be home at any moment and could go to fetch him and thus prevent one of us from freezing to death on the road . " She had gotten to her feet ; with very littleeffort he could have seized her and shaken her and forced from her some more respectful speech  --  but not now , not here . " Very well , " ho said . He laid Amalia 's hand back on the coverlet andp218felt her forehead . She was very cold , even to his hand still cold from the long ride home . He straightened and looked at them . " I will go . Keep her warm , try to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maclver cut off his further instructions . " Look  --  she is trying to speak ! What is it , Miss Thayer ? Tell us what you swallowed ! " She bent over the bed , but Amalia , struggling to focus her eyes , looked not at her but at Bradshaw . Her face worked with the effort to speak ; a fresh eruption of dark fluid spilled from her mouth . For a moment the room was very still . Bradshaw waited . After this , he knew , there would be no need to fetch Dr. Knight . The words for which Amalia struggled finally came . " Murderer , " she whispered . " Murderer . " She paused ; she made a great effort . " When lust bath conceived , it bringeth forth sin : and sin , when it is finished , bringethforth death . " And then a flood from her twisted lips , and a shower of sparks from the fire , and Miss Maclver 's wailing began again . On the night of February 17  --  18 , 1843 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many people saw it . Many feared it . Some  --  not so many  --  made use of it . A few took notes and drew sketches so that its appearancewould be well documented . It was later calculated that this was one of the largest comets ever seen : its tail was two hundred million miles long . Almost everyone who saw it received it as a sign from God ; even unbelievers were given pause as they watched the fiery wanderer hurtling across the heavens . Josiah Bradshaw saw it from the window of his library : a brilliant streak arching through the night high above the river valley . He was not a superstitious man  --  he was not even , any longer , a very religious man  --  but as he watched its luminous progress his heart rose and his soul came free from the deadweight which had burdened it for long months past . He felt a tear come to his eye , and , unashamed ( for who could see exceptan increasingly distant God ? ) , he wiped the tear away and took courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aroused from sleep by the cries of her companions . As she watched at the window , she felt the return of the terror which shep219had experienced at Father Miller 's camp meeting . Ah , God  --  1 But the fears of the other girls kept her from fully experiencing her own . They were terrified , badly shaken : what did it mean ? The Apocalypse ? In vain Elizabeth Parker , who wrote of scientific subjects for the Offering , attempted to calm them ; it was a natural phenomenon , she said , it had nothing to do with the end of the world . Sabra fastened herself to this knowledge , this calm voice explaining what they saw ; she echoed Elizabeth'swords as she soothed the quaking , awestruck females around her . The house was in an uproar . Everyone was awake . Mrs. Clapham , angry that she had been called too late to see the spectacle , strode up the stairs , nightcap askew , to scold her charges and shoo them back to bed . Comets , Ten-Hour , ruined reputations , weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom , she did not stop to think ) to keep her constantlyin agitation , constantly fearful of losing her place . In calmer moments , in the privacy of her room , Mrs. Clapham prayed quietly for an uneventful life ; now , afraid of mass panic , she spoke sharply to her girls and ordered them , all distracted as they were , back to bed . Minerva Swan went willingly enough , although even after her roommatesquieted she remained awake , seeing again in her mind 's eye that awesome trajectory of light . How to describe it ? More  --  how to use it ? For surely such a thing must be used . It was a gift from God : she must not refuse it . She wished that she were a painter . How easy , to brush pale color against a field of black and call it " Comet . " Silas Blood , itemizing supplies for the Community , saw the comet from Henry Winfield 's house in Concord . Winfield himself was not at home ; he had gone to lecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the display in the sky with interest , sorry that Winfield was not with him . Winfield 's comments on such an extravaganza , so meaningless apart from its own ephemeral beauty , would have been words to treasure as they forged on together in their great work . Comets , signs from God , spiritual revelation  --  all were irrelevant , all distractions from the true task , which was to make Heaven , or a reasonable imitation of it , here on earth . When the light had faded , and the sky was dark once more , pinpricked by stars that seemed unaccustomedly faint , Silas returned with new diligence to his work : fifty shovels , twenty axes , fifteen saws . How dull a list for so daring a venture ! But he must hurry , Winfield must hurry , their time was growing short . The new religious mania sweeping the land  --  the Milleritesat their camp meetings , the Mormons , the Shakers  --  all were potentialenemies , diverting souls and , more important , cash from their own venture . This comet tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Armageddon ; new enthusiasm would spring up for the Second Coming , people would increasingly neglect their earthly lives to prepare to meet the Lord . And the Lord would keep them waiting ; and their lives would disintegrate ; and finally , disheartened , they wouldp220come to the end of their days without ever having known the best that the world could offer : the New Way , Winfield 's dream . Father William Miller , who had given his name to those who would be saved on the Day of Judgment , saw the terrible glowing thing in the sky as he was being driven home from an evening 's preaching at a small country church near Portsmouth . Instantly , in his hoarse , quavering voice , he ordered the driver to stop . Fighting off assistance , he scrambled down from the carriage and stumbled into the snow-covered meadow at the side of the road . He was dressed in an expensive cloak fashioned of the finest camel 's hair ; on his head rested a shaggy , white , broadbrimmedbeaver hat . He lifted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposing his head to the cold , but he did not notice . He sank onto his knees . For him , this was the final warning  --  the last magnificent omen from the Lord . Surely , now , it would come : the end of the old , the beginning of the new , the burning of the damned , the salvation of the born-again  --  the Apocalypse ! He had waited for it all his life ; he had warned others of what was to happen . He had been mocked and scorned and ridiculed ; people had reviled him , had persecuted his followers . He had remained firm in his faith . And now God had rewarded him , had sent this blazing messenger for all to see . Repent ! Now he could make his calculations . He would fill sheet after sheet of foolscap with a maze of numbers  --  he had his formulae , and now from this date he would be able to figure precisely the date of the final hour , the general conflagration . People had grown impatient with him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tell us exactly when , Father , so that we may make our preparations . Should we plant our crops next spring , or will next spring never come ? Should we make our harvest , add a room to the house , send our children to school ? " Now he could tell them . He was overwhelmed with joy . His legs froze in the snow ; the night wind whipped about his ears . At last the driver came to fetch him , afraid for the old man 's health . With some difficulty he got the preacher back into the carriage . Neither of them noticed the beaver hat lying in the snow ; the farmer who found it , the next day , considered it a gift from God . In New-York , Rachel Bradshaw saw the comet as she performed an errandof mercy in the company of a female friend . Together they had attendeda meeting at which certain agitators had fulminated against the President , the Congress , the several governors , the state legislators , the churches  --  against all the established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Refreshed and filled with new purpose , they had stopped to visit a poor woman who , deserted by her husband , had attempted to support herself and her three young children by sewingshirts . She had worked eighteen hours a day for the past year , earningbetween twenty and twenty-five cents a day . Now she had fallen ill . Her children were hungry , her landlord threatening to evict her from herp221miserable room . The indignation stirred up in the two young women by the agitators at the meeting now found immediate focus in the sad spectaclebefore them . Horrified , deflected momentarily from their larger , general purpose , they concentrated now upon the specific : was not this poor woman a slave also ? They promised to return in an hour with food and clothing . They hurried out into the street again sobered and shocked by what they had seen . Just then they saw the comet , and to them , as much as to Father Miller , it seemed to be a sign ; and as they gazed at it , mesmerized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as dedicated as his . Chattel slavery had its growing number of enemies ; but who would speak for the poor slaves in the Northern cities , living out their lives by the slavery of their needle ? Certain Boston capitalists saw the comet , but they were mostly practical , hard-headed men little given to open-mouthed wonder . The only natural phenomenon that had ever struck them dumb was the thirty-foot drop of the Merrimack River at the Pawtucket Falls . For them , a sign from God  --  the supreme overseer  --  was not a comet but a drought ; the end of the world was not the Apocalypse but a rise in the price of raw cotton . In the Paddy Camp Lands , the huts and hovels in which the people lived had no windows , and the refuse-clogged alleyways were hardly fit for nighttime strolling ; and so only a few inebriates staggering home from the rumseller 's saw the comet , but they put it down to hallucination and thought no more about it . But the priest and his sexton saw it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a brighter day for their people , perhaps , or at least of a new church building . The sexton , who had been a Whiteboy in County Clare , allowed himself to hope that the comet might even be a sign of God 's favor to the Liberator  --  O'Connell , in this case , since the sexton had never heard of Garrison . But he kept his thoughts to himself ; the priest frowned upon all nationalist sentiment , and had explicitly forbidden all criticism of England , of landlords , of the Union Bill , and all such historic entrapments . In the small hours the comet burned away , leaving the night sky black and empty , the stars hardly worthy of notice . Why had it come ? Where had it gone ? What had it signified ?  |p222Midsummer  : the time of low water . Many of the mills shut down . The girls dispersed . The city baked in the sun . The slow time : the time of sickness . Cholera and typhus came fast again in indiscriminate slaughter . The water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all who drank it . The inhabitants of the city drank it . Many died . Death came to the countryside , too , but there he had a smaller harvest , at least in summer . But if he could not straightaway take people 's bodies , he could attack obliquely at their minds . Death stalked the spirit , even in the green and peaceful country . On the Prospect Hill Road , twelve miles west of Lowell , a horse and trap carried two young people to the summit of the rise . They had been traveling since early morning in the hot sun , which now , by noon , had dried the road to powder . The way ran the length of the hill . Spread below them to their right was the broad Nashoba Valley . Mount Wachusettrose blue in the distance . The countryside was very still . The few isolated farms which they passed seemed uninhabited , although here and there they caught sight of a figure weeding a garden or hanging out a wash . Sabra was dizzy from the heat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thirsty and hungry ; she wanted only to alight from the jolting trap and lie down in the shade to rest . She had not seen Silas for months  --  not since late March . He had been away again , busy , occupied with his and Winfield 's affairs . She glanced at him from beneath the brim of her palm-leaf bonnet . He had shaved his beard ; once again he looked as he had when she met him at the Bradshaws ' , except that now , of course , his face had matured , had lost the baffled , hungering look it had worn when she first knew him . Decidedly , he was a homely young man . But men did not need beauty as a woman did ; they needed only the willingness to marry , to support a wife . Any man , even the ugliest , could have his pick of women in New England . He felt her scrutiny . With his free hand he patted her arm . " Almost there . Do you see that big oak up ahead ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will have to lead the horse down through the meadow  --  there is no road . " They came to the place and climbed down . Sabra stretched her legs gratefully . She took a deep breath . The air was sweet with the smell ofp223clover . They stood at the edge of the road and looked down across a broad expanse of meadow to a dark red farmhouse shaded by tall trees . In the past several months the " Consociate Family , " as they called themselves , had gathered here at this place which they called " Bountiful " to show the world how to live the perfect life . They were guided by their mentor , Moses Trueworthy . Now , seeing it for herself , Sabra felt a small shock of disappointment . It was distinguished from any ordinary farm only by the beauty of its setting . She had thought to see something quite different , she did not know what . To one side of the house was a cluster of conical shapes : beehives . She saw a peak-roofed well , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apple trees . As they began to lead the horse across the meadow , she saw emerge from the orchard two figures , two men , the shorter one attired in a long , flapping brown smock and broadbrimmedstraw hat , the taller dressed more conventionally in coat and trousers . They were deep in conversation , heads wagging , hands alive ; the smocked one tripped over something but caught himself before he fell . " Ah ! " said Silas . " There he is . I was not absolutely sure he would be here , and I wanted you to meet him . He often goes off at short notice . " " Which is he ? " said Sabra cautiously ; but she knew before he spoke , and her heart sank . " The shorter one , " said Silas . " Wait until you meet him . He is a genius , Sabra , he could reform the world if only he would consent to dress properly . But you must not mind the way he looks . Listen to what he says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe . I have n't met him . They say that when Trueworthyvisited England two years ago , Pike talked to him for an hour and sold his business at once and swore that his life 's work lay with the Consociates . But the English have always appreciated Trueworthy 's teachings more than people here have done . " Like Winfield , he might have added : they had enormously admired Winfield , too . And by his countrymen he was ignored  --  No . Today was a special day ; he would allow himself no bitter thoughts , no premonitions of failure . He had come here at Winfield 's request to see how Trueworthy fared in his experiment ; he would do that , and add , if he could , a special request of his own . No more . They led the horse down across the meadow to the farmhouse ; during these few minutes the two conversationalists , seemingly oblivious to their surroundings , circled the house three times , as if the expression of their thoughts depended on the quick propulsion of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Silas came up ; catchingsight of the newcomers , the smocked figure gave them a cheerful wave without breaking stride.  | " Halloo ! Glad to see you ! Water the horse in back  --  go right in and sit down  --  make yourselves at home ! " The last words were uttered as he rounded the corner of the house and disappeared once again from view . Silas laughed . " There , is n't he pleasant ? I 'm sure he did n't recognize me , although we 've met . But when he gets to thinking and talking , he forgets . " In the house they were confronted by a harassed-looking woman whose pale face and straggling gray hair contrasted with her lively , intelligenteyes . " Ah  --  Mrs. Trueworthy ! " exclaimed Silas . " How good to see you again ! Do you remember , we met at Mr. Winfield 's last year  --  Silas Blood  --  and this is Miss Sabra Palfrey . " She rewarded them with a brief , somewhat pained smile . " Yes , of course , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were just about to sit down to dinner . Please join us . " Looking behind Mrs. Trueworthy , Sabra saw a room which was no more than a wide extension of the entrance hall . A fireplace filled one wall ; a long table set with many places took up most of the rest of the space . " That 's very good of you , thanks , " said Silas . " I 'll just call the others , " said Mrs. Trueworthy in a tired voice . She disappeared through a back door and in a moment they heard the sharp clang of a bell . Through a doorway on her left Sabra saw two scraggly men poring over a pile of books . Beyond them , high on top of an overflowing bookcase , she saw a large marble bust of a snub-nosed , baldheadedman who bore a startling resemblance to their host . At the sound of the bell they came to attention and bolted out to the table , almost colliding with the newcomers in their rush . Sabra heard the thunder of feet overhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrow stairs and took their places . No one spoke to Sabra or Silas , although they did receive some curious glances and a friendly nod or two . Three of the five now at table wore linen smocks like Mr. Trueworthy 's . Now , from outdoors , came a scramble of children  --  three little girls , it seemed , all dressed in identical smocks with similar short-cropped hair . The largest girl lugged a baby perhaps eight months old . They were followed by a tall , luxuriously bearded man and by Mrs. Trueworthy , who took her place at the head of the table , settled the baby on her lap , and waved a distracted hand at the newcomers . " Sit where you will  --  take a plate  --  Mr. Trueworthy and Mr. Pike seem to have disappeared again , so perhaps you will say the words , Mr. Brown . " " There was a general shuffle as everyone moved to give Sabra and Silas a narrow place on one of the long benches . Then a silence fell as theyp225looked expectantly at the tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low , rumbling voice : " Live in peace ; work in health ; love thy neighbor ; harm no living creature ; renounce the lusts of the flesh ; hear the dictates of the spirit ; obey God 's will . Amen . " At once there was a scramble for the bowls of fruits and vegetables both cooked and raw  --  peas , beans , carrots , cherries , peaches  --  and the plates of large brown rocks which seemed to be bread baked in knobby , fantastic shapes . Silas had said that the Trueworthys were followers of Sylvester Graham  --  but surely Graham did not prescribe such odd dimensionsfor his loaves ? Everyone devoured the food as if half-starved . They would put the girls at the boarding houses to shame , thought Sabra , so fast do they eat . But then there was so little here , compared to the abundanttable set by Mrs. Clapham , that to attempt to eat slowly , to hold back from grabbing a dish , was not to eat at all . With Silas ' help she secureda portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loaf of bread between them . She was glad enough to drink the cold water set out in pitchers , but , having quenched her thirst , she would have been happier still for a glass of lemonade or a cup of tea . Neither , it seemed , was on the menu . at Bountiful . Given the rapidity of mastication , and the paucity of the repast , in ten minutes or less most of the men had finished their meal and , without a word to Mrs. Trueworthy or to the guests , had risen from the table and returned to whatever they had been doing when the dinner bell had rung . The children vanished , too , taking the baby with them ; finally only Mrs. Trueworthy and Mr. Brown remained with Sabra and Silas . " Delicious , Mrs. Trueworthy , " said Silas heartily , draining his mug of water . " Good plain food , pure cold water . A meal fit for a  --  not a king , no . For a philosopher ! " Brown eyed him warily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am , yes , and this young lady is. one of the celebrated mill girls from Lowell . Allow me  --  I am Silas Blood , and this is Miss Sabra Pal-frey . " Brown nodded agreeably enough , but did not introduce himself to them in turn ; after an awkward moment Mrs. Trueworthy murmured , " Amos Brown . " He stood up , not to shake Silas ' hand but to return to his work . He was a big man , well over six feet , as broad as a bull ; his shoulders bulged under the thin , coarse stuff of his gray shirt , his heavily muscled forearms protruded from his rolled sleeves . His hair and his beard were lightly flecked with white ; he was perhaps forty years old . He paused for a moment before he went out ; then he spoke to Mrs. Trueworthy as if they wore alone.  | " Did you ask him ? " " Yes . " " And what  --  " " No . He said no , he said he wo n't have it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snorted Brown . " Let him eat his principles . I 'm goin ' to Harvard Village tomorrow and I 'm bringin ' back an ox . If he do n't like it , he do n't have to eat what I plant . " A look very like terror passed across Mrs. Trueworthy 's thin , careworn face . " You must n't  --  " " 0 yes , " said Brown . " I must . But do n't you worry about it . I should 've spoke to him myself . I 'll tell him tonight . Do n't you mention it . " He hesitated for a moment , but said nothing more . Then he turned and went outside . Mrs. Trueworthy made no move to rise and clear the table . Sabra , who was quite willing to help , thought that she should wait for a signal from her hostess before she began to pick up the plates . Silas cleared his throat . " You prosper here , ma'am ? The children seem well  --  " " Yes , " she said abruptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such fruitful discussion that he nourishes his mind to the detriment of his body . That was jasper Pike walking with him , was it not ? " " Yes . " Sabra thought somewhat irreverently that long years of marriage to a renowned conversationalist seemed to have atrophied Mrs. Trueworthy 's own powers of speech . " Well  --  " Silas looked around , somewhat at a loss ; he smiled encouraginglyat Sabra . " If you ladies do n't mind , I think I 'll go outside and find Mr. Trueworthy . I have some messages for him from Concord and Boston . Thanks again for the dinner , ma'am . Sabra , will you be all right for an hour or so ? I believe there 's a very good collection of books in the library , and perhaps you can help Mrs. Trueworthy ? " " Of course , " said Sabra . " Anything I can do  --  " She glanced at Mrs. Trueworthy , who sat quite still . Silas left by the front door . After he had gone the two women sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward , her elbows on the table , and stared at her guest , her eyes alive with curiosity . " You work in a mill ? " she said . " That 's right . " " A cotton factory ? " " Yes . " " Mr. Trueworthy was in England two years ago . He went to Man/chester . He said that it was dreadful  --  Hell on earth . Lowell is not like that ? " " No . I have heard of the English towns . Lowell is quite  --  well , not Heaven , perhaps , but certainly quite decent . " " And you are independent ? Ycu support yourself with no help from anyone ? " It was as if Mrs. Trueworthy allowed herself to express her thoughts only with the removal of the last male . She has not been silencedafter all , thought Sabra ; she is merely cautious . " We do , yes . " Mrs. Trueworthy 's eyes shone . " What do you earn ? Excuse me for askingsuch personal questions , but I see so few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to me  --  and I am interested . I would like to see Lowell some day . It is a splendid idea , to give women a chance at a decentliving , independent  --  so many have no hope . The owners are regular philanthropists , they are so kind , are they not , to have started up the manufactories in order to provide women with an occupation . We all should be grateful to them . " Sabra thought of Betsey Rudd , of Ten-Hour , of Jessie Pratt 's damaged , lint-filled lungs . " I earn two dollars and twelve cents a week above board , " she said . " Two dollars and twelve cents , " breathed Mrs. Trueworthy . " Every week ? " " Well  --  every week that I work . Of course I do not get paid if I am sick , and I am not paid now , for the next two weeks , because the mills are shut because of low water . " " Still  --  two dollars and twelve cents , " repeated Mrs. Trueworthy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had that much money . Not for my own . What little comes in from Mr. Trueworthy 's admirers  --  and he does have admirers by the score , but most of them are as poor as we  --  that littlealways goes again immediately . We barter for much , but some things only cash can buy . Two dollars and twelve cents ! Why , in a lifetime  --  in ten or twenty years , even  --  you could save a fortune out of that ! You could be wealthy ! Even if you worked for only a few years  --  I " " Of course most of the girls do just that , " said Sabra . " Very few stay a lifetime . It 's been only twenty years since the mills started up , and I know of no one who has been there that long . Mostly they work for a while and then get married . Some work after they have married , of course  --  " " Ah , but then their wages belong to their husbands , " said Mrs. Trueworthywith the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Marriedwomen do n't count . Do you mind  --  I am just curious  --  but may I ask you how much you have saved ? You have worked for how long ? " " Four years and a little more . " Four years ! " And as for my savings , I 'm afraid I 've saved very little . "  | " You should . You will need it . You should not waste that precious money on clothes , or jewelry , or whatever  --  " " 0 , but I have n't wasted it , Mrs. Trueworthy . I am sure that you have heard of the Community which Mr. Blood is planning together with Henry Winfield . They constantly need funds to carry on their work  --  even as Mr. Trueworthy does . I have given most of my money to them . " Mrs. Trueworthy looked down at the table ; she made no reply . Her face , which had been alive with curiosity and the enjoyment of their talk , became once again the tired and  --  what ? defeated ?  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her eyes still downcast . " That is very generous of you . " " Generous it may be , " replied Sabra , " but then I expect to be rewarded , too , with a place in their Community . I am looking forward to it with great happiness " Mrs. Trueworthy met her eyes again . " When do they expect to begin ? " " Why  --  they had hoped to start this summer , but there was some difficulty about the property title . Next spring now is the time they have fixed . " " Next spring . " Mrs. Trueworthy 's mouth twisted into a small , tight smile . " Next spring . Well . I wish you good hick . You will need it . " Resting her red , rawboned hands on the table she pushed herself into a standing position . She began to pick up the dishes , scraping and stackingthem at the table ; even Huldah at Mrs. Clapham 's did not do that , thought Sabra , and the Trueworthys were after all supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  there was very little left in them  --  out to the scullery . After the meal had been cleared away Mrs. Trueworthy began to measure out the flour for a baking . She worked steadily , silently , her face set ; it was as if she , like any cotton operative , was mindful of the overseer , for all that he was not actually in the room . Sabra , watching her , wondered about that face : was this the happy member of that Communallife about which she had heard so much from Silas ? Sabra forgot Mr. Trueworthy 's library ; this woman before her seemed a source of much more pertinent information . But like many libraries , Mrs. Trueworthy was locked . And the key  --  ? " You are quite famous , you know , " she said . " Everyone in Concord is talking about you , Silas says . " " They talk about my husband . Not me . " " No , but I believe that you are mentioned quite frequently . " Mrs. Trueworthy 's mouth seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be used in Mr. Trueworthy 's work . Do not forget that . I do not . Besides , I thought they talked about the Ripleys at West Roxbury " " O , yes , but this is a much more interesting experiment , they say . " " Interesting , " said Mrs. Trueworthy . " Yes . I am sure we are that . "  |p229Sabra  heard the faint note of sarcasm . " I wonder if you could tell me , since I plan to go into a Community myself  --  do you miss the world ? I often worry that I will miss it , for all that I will be glad to leave the factory . But one has to be so  --  dedicatedforthis . " She looked around the sparsely furnished room  --  Mrs. Trueworthyworked at the dining table for lack of other space  --  and thought that the boarding-house parlor seemed luxurious by comparison . Mrs. Trueworthy paused . She did not look at Sabra as she spoke , as if her eyes would contradict her words . " Yes . One must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , but I am as curious about this as you are about my life , the wages I earn . " After a moment Mrs. Trueworthy replied . Her voice was low , expressionless , speaking words that she had memorized long ago and repeated many times . " Moses Trueworthy is a very great man , Miss Palfrey . I am privileged to share his life , wherever that life may lead . My children , too , will realizewhen they grow up how fortunate they were to have such a man as their father . " " Because he seeks the New Life ? " " Because he seeks God . " " And so the things of this world  --  " " Are to be renounced , insofar as we have the strength to do so . " " And you never have doubts about the wisdom of this way ? " Mrs. Trueworthy 's eyes met Sabra 's . " Mr. Trueworthy says , When indoubt  --  about anything  --  abstain . " ' " But one must live , all the same . One must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twitched . " You have not met Mr. Bowers . He meditates all day . He does not believe in clothing . He walks at night , naked , through the meadow and up into the hills . He believes that clothingare an impediment to spiritual growth . He is closer to God , he says , when he perambulates in the state of Nature . I told him I wanted to see him close to God in January . " They laughed together , then ; Mrs. Trueworthy , for a moment , looked as young as a girl . " Word got about in Harvard Village that a mysterious white figure was flitting across the countryside . People thought it was a ghost . They were very frightened . One night , several weeks ago , an armed posse rode out from the village and nearly captured him . Fortunatelyhe was able to run back to us in time . Mr. Trueworthy went out to speak to them . Somehow he was able to make them understand that Mr. Bowers was merely practicing his religion . But of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light ; she paused , seized by some private thought of which she could not speak.  | " What about your children ? " said Sabra . " They do not miss having playmates , a regular school  --  " " They have a school here , Miss Palfrey . " Again Mrs. Trueworthy 's face was closed , the words spoken by rote . " Mr. Pike has them for three hours each morning . They keep journals , their grammar and penmanship are excellent , they know Greek and Latin and the Ancient and Modern Histories .... " Her voice broke ; she grimaced as she attempted to regain her place in her recitation . " Mr. Trueworthy , of course , has charge of their spiritual development . " " Of course , " echoed Sabra . " To have their consciences formed by such a renowned philosopher makes them fortunate indeed  --  " " We are all fortunate , " said Mrs. Trueworthy flatly . " If the world remembersus at all it will be because of our association with him . " Their conversation was interrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Jasper Pike and Silas Blood in tow . He came in quite like any ordinary human being , stepping over the thresholdand mopping his high , broad brow with a large white handkerchief . Perhaps his mind was still on the subject of his conversation , or perhaps he was simply blinded by the passage from the brilliant world outdoors to the more subdued light of the kitchen ; but at any rate , for a moment he seemed oblivious to the presence of the two women . It was not until Mrs. Trueworthy made an introduction  --  " Miss Palfrey from Lowell "  --  that he was aware of Sabra ; then he turned to her , extending his hand , and murmured a greeting . " Ah  --  yes  --  Miss  --  ah  --  pleased , pleased  --  " Sabra , who had risen to her feet , was left with an impression of mild blue eyes , an average-sized man , curiously weak-looking despite his majesticbrow . He shambled around the room , muttering snatches of his thought as he went . He had hardly looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment he allowed Mrs. Trueworthy to sit him down at the table , Silas and Jasper Pike across from him , and place before him a loaf of bread , thickly sliced , and a mug of water . He ate in silence , his thoughts elsewhere . His two companions , having been served nothing , watched him , seeming to draw sufficient refreshment from that alone . Mrs. Trueworthy concentrated on her work ; Sabra was left free to observe the men . Her gaze rested briefly on Silas . She knew his face as well as she knew her own  --  better , in fact , for she seldom looked into a mirror . And althoughshe never tired of looking at him , she did not do so now for long , with these two new figures of such interest before her . Moses Trueworthychewed steadily ; he was clearly alone with his thoughts . His massivehead , sparsely covered with graying brown hair , nodded slightly on his heavily seamed neck . He looked like a ruminating cow . She settled on Jasper Pike : lean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow headp231crowned by long auburn hair slicked down flat over his collar ; a long pointed nose , a long swath of jaw , small eyes of unknown color : a curiously discontent , untranquil face for one so totally engaged in the pursuit of human happiness . Only once did he remove his eyes from Trueworthy 's visage to cast a swift and angry glance at Trueworthy 's wife . Sabra saw with some dismay that she returned it : they glared at each other for a moment , openly hostile . In fact they were at war , these two , although neither admitted it . They battled over the man breaking bread before them : the renowned philosopher , the man whose visions of Utopia had led him to live according to his ideals , much to the consternation of ordinary folk . After a long winter of discussion and planning , Pike had taken the mortgage on the farm ; since he had assumed the financial burden of the Consociate Family , he had thought that he could assume also the direction of its development . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules by which , in good time , they would reform not a dozen souls on an isolated farm , but the entire world , north and south , east and west  --  even the heathenChinese , he thought , would come around to his way in time . Annihilation of the self was his most ardent wish : to stifle in every bosom that natural , human tendency to act in animal self-interest . " Harmonicbeing , " he called this ideal state : the triumph of the spirit over the flesh . The sex act was anathema . He knew : he had tried it once , and had got a son for his pains . The boy lived now with the mother in Liverpool . Pike did not care if he ever saw them again , particularly the boy . Every time he looked at the child he was reminded  --  revolted  --  by this living evidenceof his own animal nature . No ! The base self which demanded release must be crushed  --  rooted out and destroyed . That fact had come to be the nub of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to surrender her husband to Pike 's scheme ; she wanted to live a " normal " life . Normal ! He was overcome with revulsion every time he thought what such a word implied : gross , degrading coupling like soulless animals . Every day he preached his doctrine of celibacy to Moses Trueworthy , and every day the philosopher wrestled with the problem , agonized over it until his broad brow was as furrowed as Brown 's fields . Come with me to see the Shakers , Pike had said . They had gone : had seen the busy workshops , the bursting storerooms , the thriving trade in herbs and baskets and well-turned chairs . Pike had labored with his friend as they walked home : you see where they get their energy , he said , they store it up within themselves to do God 's work , they do not expend it wastefully on sexual indulgence . Trueworthy had nodded thoughtfully , seeing the logic of Pike 's arguments  --  hut then he had confronted his wife again , and weakened because he thought hep232loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Pike was sure of it . Fools ! Mrs. Trueworthy was a thorn in his fleshless side in other ways as well . Obedient as she was , devoted to her husband and his beliefs , still she had rebelled on the matter of a lamp . She was so busy during the day , she said , that she needed light after dark to sew . Pike had forbidden it . Lamps burned whale oil : a treasure taken from the bodies of helpless beasts hunted down and cruelly slaughtered . No whale had ever harmed a man ; it was sinful to kill them , doubly sinful to enrich their murderers by buying the products of the kill . Mrs. Trueworthy had understood very well the logic of his argument , but still she had persisted : she needed a lamp at night . Bayberry candles would do as well , but they were too dear . No one at Bountiful had any ready cash . Finally her husband had given in to her , and now she had her lamp . Pike cringed every time he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her successful challenge to his authority . In other matters of conscience , Mrs. Trueworthy had been more cooperative  --  althoughalways , when she spoke to him , she wore that look of indefinable antagonism . She had agreed that no animal product could be used at Bountiful , nor any product which had caused harm to any living creature , man or beast . Neither cotton , harvested by slaves , nor wool , stolen from sheep ; neither leather taken from dead animals nor silk taken from live ones ; not milk or butter , not cheese , eggs , fish , or any kind of flesh ; not tea , coffee , or molasses , all shipped in by slave traders ; not sugar or rice ; not even manure on the fields was permitted , for was not manure the product of animals as much as skin or meat ? " Aspiring " crops were the best : apples and pears , cherries and peaches and plums , peas and beans , wheat , rye , oats , buckwheat , corn . After some discussion , Pike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be grown as well , despite the fact that they grew downward into the earth instead of up into the air . And so their diet included potatoes and beets and carrots and radishes ; it had been a hard compromise but a necessary one . Potatoes , in particular , were wonderfully filling ; in some happier future time , Pike thought , some genius  --  some other genius , a botanicalrather than a philosophical one  --  would perfect a substitute for potatoes which would grow above ground , thus enabling the conscientiousboth to fill their stomachs and quiet their nagging minds . Some other genius : and how was he to be born ? The lusts of the flesh were the root of all evil ; renunciation was the cross on which they were to be sacrificed . In that , the Shakers were correct . Increasingly as the summer passed , Pike had thought longingly of the busy , self-contained community not three miles distant . Why was he staying on at Bountiful , when there , so close by , lived those who practiced his beliefs ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The philosopherp233closed his eyes for a moment of meditation . There was now on Pike 's long , sour face an expression very close to contempt , for he had come to know this man better , perhaps , than he had anticipated . Trueworthy was brilliant , but he was weak in the matter of his wife . Another month ; two at the most , thought Pike . Then , if he still wavers , if he still can not give her up , I will leave him . In the late afternoon Sabra walked with Silas through the meadow to the orchard . The sun sank toward the distant mountains , casting long shadows on the grass . In the adjoining field they could see the tall figure of Amos Brown as he walked a rough furrow sowing a late crop . Silas took her hand . " Peaceful , is it not ? A place to restore the soul . " Sabra caught herself from replying that death was peaceful , too . She shut out from her memory the image of Mrs. Trueworthy 's exhausted face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silas ' hand , she breathed in the sweet country air and tried to ignore the warning , hungry rumblings in her stomach . Supper , it seemed , was served late , so that the Community'sinhabitants could take full advantage of the day 's light for their work . " Did you enjoy your conversation with Mrs. Trueworthy ? " said Silas . " Yes , I suppose I did . But it is curious  --  I came here to learn something from this place , from her . And yet I think she learned as much as I. " And she told him  --  feeling slightly as though she were betraying a confidence  --  of Mrs. Trueworthy 's questions about her earnings . Silas , although he tried to hide it , was sincerely shocked ; and she saw this . " Everyone says that she is such a selfless paragon  --  such a perfectly attunedhelpmeet , " he said . " Was she really so curious about such a worldly thing as your money ? " " She thought that I spent it on clothing  --  bonnets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it went , she approved , I suppose " Sabra hesitated . " Yes " Silas frowned . " I have been surprised , too , today , " he said . " ApparentlyMr . Pike is unhappy with things as they are here . Iie did not say so to inc directly , of course , I hardly know him  --  but from the directionp234of his discourse and questions to Mr. Trueworthy I am positive that Mr. Trueworthy has been a disappointment to him in some way . " They came among the trees , which were laden with tiny green apples . " How ? " said Sabra . He had released her hand to put his arm around her shoulder ; his tall thin body jostled hers as they walked . " I do n't know . Pike wants something , I think , that Mr. Trueworthy is not prepared to give . " " Is it important ? " " I do n't know that , either . What seems important to me is the fact of their disagreement . If these two men , renowned far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems of living in this world  --  if these two , situated in what would seem to be truly a Paradise , can not agree , can not make it work , can not find the way to show the rest of us  --  " He shook his head ; caught at a low-hanging branch to hold it out of their way ; stopped as they reached a stone wall bordering a meadow beyond . Gently he took her shoulders and turned her to face him . " But never mind that . Listen . I have something  --  some good news . " He smiled down at her . She felt the familiar sensation : because he saw her , she existed . " I have asked Moses Trueworthy for his blessing . On us . I have asked  --  Sabra , he will join us . " She did not understand ; and when , after a moment , she did , she saw at once that her slow reaction had hurt him . " Join us ! " She searched his face : no , he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  after supper . He likes you , you know . He spoke most highly of you . " She was annoyed at this last , although she could not have said exactly why . Was it so important to Silas that Moses Trueworthy approved of her ? What if be had not ? " He did n't speak to me once , nor I to him . How can he like me ? " " A man of his wisdom does n't need to hear you speak to understand . He read your face . He knows the pure in spirit . " Although she would have liked to pursue the question of the philosopher'ssensitivity , she returned her thoughts to the more pressing question . Tonight ! They sat on the stone wall facing the meadow . Beyond lay the broad Nashoba Valley , and then the distant mountains , the tallest , Mount Wachusett , towering over all . They heard no sound louder than the crickets ' thrum . A peaceful , golden afternoon ; a refuge from the busy world , tranquil and unspoiled , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dictates . And yet did not this place , too , have its unrest , its stubborn passions running close beneath the surface ? Tonight ! Suddenly she turned away from him ; she began to walk back through the orchard . " Sabra ? "  |p235He  hurried to catch up with her . His homely face was alive with concern . He reproached himself : he had been too abrupt , he should have broken his news to her more gently . He took her hand again and held it for a moment ; then , softly , he kissed it and laid her palm against his cheek . She stood quietly before him , head down , his reproachful words sounding in her ears . " If you do not wish it , Sabra , I will tell Mr. Trueworthy that we  --  that we have decided to wait . " She withdrew her hand . " It is what you want , " she said . He felt a rush of feeling for her . How small and thin she was , how hard she worked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more than he had realized . He put his arms around her , glad that she could not see his face . " I want his blessing on us , Sabra . " She felt his heart beating through his shirt , his thin gray coat . Last summer they had stood like this in the tent at Father Miller 's campground . Then he had gone away all the winter ; and returned ; and surely would go again , working for his dream . She wished that she could be alone for half an hour . She wished that she had someone  --  some female close to her , a sister , a mother  --  with whom she could discuss her situation . Mrs. Clapham , delighted as she was whenever one of her girls married , would have been horrified at the thought of a " joining " at Bountiful . Minerva Swan , perhaps ? She tried to summon Minerva 's plump , pretty face to her mind 's eye , but it would not come . She shook her head . Just there , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? The familiar phantom , the figure which she had tried and failed so often to see ; now it skittered away once more . She wanted to grasp that image , confront her  --  for it was female , unquestionably  --  demand of her : " Who are you ? And what ? Why do you come ? " No : it was gone , fled into a field of light , its familiar retreat . He turned her face to his . She saw in his dark , deep-set eyes an expressionwhich she was sure she understood . 0 , to be loved , to be cher-ished  --  ! " How will we live ? When we go away from here , where do we go ? To Concord ? " " No . We will return to our separate lives . I must go west again in September . We must raise more money . And next spring  --  next summer at the latest  --  we will go into the Community together , as man and wife . " " Then why this  --  ceremony  --  now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Even as she spoke she felt guilty ; she had never questioned his judgment . " Because we are here , and he is here , and  --  to put it quite frankly  --  I want to take advantage of his presence . I do not believe that he is well . " Ile dropped his hand , looked away from her across the valley ; his facep236was troubled . " When I saw him today I realized that we should not wait . Not if we want his blessing , which most certainly I do . If we wait until next spring , he may not be here . He may not be anywhere . Perhaps Jasper Pike will take him back to England , perhaps he will fall ill  --  I do not know . I want to accept his offer now , while we have him . I feel that our life together will be blessed if we do this thing here and now . We do not need civil or religious ceremony . We need a spiritual blessing which only he can give . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I want Trueworthy . Winfield is a more practical man , and his Community will succeed where this one may fail . But Trueworthy is closer to the Ultimate . I want to hear him say the words over us . Can you understand that ? " He returned to her , clasping both her hands . She smothered her annoyance at his question ; she was not a child , of course she understood . If only he had given her some warning " Yes , " she said . " Of course . " She looked down ; she saw the blue-andwhiteflowered gingham of her dress . To be married in this ! To return to the factory as if nothing had happened ! In accordance with what Silas had told her about Winfield 's views on marriage , she had not planned for her wedding as so many girls did , had not laid up a dowry , had not embroidered sheets and pillowcases , had not sewed a trousseau or bought furnishings , china , silver . It had been more important  --  was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' work . And yet  --  was it to be , finally , an impromptu affair at this poor farm , an opportunity grasped rather than an event , no matter how modest , planned ahead ? Apparently . And , with that , she felt a transformation . Her separate self suddenly disappeared ; she felt a new person in her place . A very different person , as yet faintly discerned , but even now welcome , for it was not herself but her reflection of him . She no longer need be concerned about what she was . Only about him : and she would reflect his being . Her new identity would be his . Sabra Palfrey would exist as a name for a while longer , perhaps , but now  --  this minute  --  that person had gone . Instead , Silas Blood had taken on a new dimension . She would disappear in him : in his life 's work . She gave him her answer ; she reached up to him , she put her arms around his neck and felt the sweet pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had forgotten entirely the image of Mrs. Trueworthy'sface : she saw only her own golden life ahead , safely sheltered against the world.  |p237Moonlight  flooded the orchard . The little band of celebrants stood ringed around the bridal couple . All were still ; it was a moment of meditation . Crickets sang their song ; one of the children yawned loudly . Up on the hillside near the road the white ghost of a figure flitted to and fro , but he , communing closely with his God , knew better than to intrude his naked body like some pagan wood-nymph on the ceremony beneath the trees . The guiding spirit of them all cleared his throat and stretched out his hand to the two young people before him . " We are gathered here tonight to consecrate the union of  --  ah  --  Sabra Palfrey and Silas Blood . This is a union of mind as well as body ; of spirit as well as flesh ; of life purpose as well as mutual love . " He turned his face to the sky ; his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " O God , whose teachings guide us to seek a life close to Thee , take these two young people to Thy heart and cherish them . Show them Thy Light  --  the True Way  --  the life to live on earth to prepare them for Thy I leaven . " The voice trembled . A night wind rustled the leaves . Someone hiccoughed . " O God , remove from these two souls all earthly desires , all fleshly wants . Catch them up into the clear light of Thy Heavenly love and illuminatetheir hearts with Thy wisdom . Save them from this world . Protect them from its passions . Give to them the strength to live their earthly lives in accordance with Thy teaching , and let them know  --  " A loud sneeze came from the ranks of the spectators . The speaker , thrown off his thought , returned his gaze to his subjects . A silence . Then : " Do you , Silas , take Sabra to be your wife ? " " I do . " " And do you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do . " " I pronounce you one in the eyes of God . " Silence again . Then , awkwardly , Silas kissed her , pushing askew the crown of meadow daisies braided for her by the children . A general relaxation ; a small surge forward to congratulate the happy pair . Sabra watched it all ; most especially she watched herself  --  strange ,  |p238new  , adorned with Nature 's tokens . It was as if the spirit of her former self hovered close above the treetops , not yet quite daring to depart , needing to make sure that this new person  --  this shadow of Silas Blood  --  would survive before she might safely take her leave . She smiled and nodded at the gaunt , hopeful faces around her . One figure stood apart ; he turned , seemingly impatient , and she saw his loweringstare : Jasper Pike , poorly concealing his outrage at the profaning of his domain by such a ceremony . They stayed at Bountiful for three days . All the beds in the house were taken , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Silas was pleased that Mr. Owen 's sexual theories worked so well in practice . He had tried to explain them to Sabra on their first night as man and wife , but he had stuttered and stumbled , for once in his life at a loss for words , and so finally he had given up trying to tell her and had simply gone ahead and acted . She had , he thought , behaved remarkably well ; he knew that many men suffered with hysterical wives on their wedding nights  --  women who refused to perform the marriage act , who fainted in horror when they learned what was expected of them . On their last day with the Consociate Family , Mrs. Trueworthy sat with Sabra under the grape arbor while Silas settled some final important question with her husband and Jasper Pike . As she spoke , she idly watched the baby , Conscience , crawling through the weedy grass at her feet . " I 'm glad you came to see us , " she said . " I 've enjoyed having another  --  having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " " Yes , " said Sabra . " Yes , perhaps I  --  we  --  can . " She had not yet become accustomed to the plural ; she reminded herself once again that she was no longer alone . " And if we can ever help you in any way , Sabra , please let us know . Mr. Trueworthy thinks the world and all of Mr. Blood , I can see that he does , for all they disagree on certain questions of procedure . So if there is ever anything we can do  --  " Sabra smiled in a deprecating way . As much as she had come to like this plain , tired , earnestly good-willed woman , she could not avoid a small spasm of contempt : help from this poor creature ? The Trueworthys themselves , come winter , would need all the help they could find ; their harvest , if indeed they had a harvest , would be little enough to see them through until next year . Still , Mrs. Trueworthy had meant the offer as a kindness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thank you , " she said . " Just let us know , " said Mrs. Trueworthy . She reached out and patted Sabra 's hand . " Anything at all . Oh , Consciencep239The baby had vomited grass , and so their peaceful moment came to an end as Mrs. Trueworthy scooped her up and rushed her into the house . Shortly afterward , Silas came leading the horse , and they said goodbyto Bountiful . The great wheel of the year turned , began the downslide into autumn . Operatives came , operatives left : some of their own accord , some dismissed . " Why , Miss Swan , " said Mr. Lyford when Minerva handed in her notice , " I thought you were happy here . " She knew what he meant : experienced weavers were hard to find now , and of course he was sorry to see her go . Before the summer shutdown , she had sent a manuscript to Hutchins &; Ross in Boston . And so when Mr. Hutchins wrote and asked her to go to see him , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She took the cars . She had never ridden them before , she had never been to Boston before . The streets were more crowded than the streets in Lowell on pay day . Twice she was lost and had to stop to ask directions , and both times they were kindly given . But when she found the offices of Hutchins &; Ross it all became easy like a dream . In a dream , very often , you can do what never seemed possible in life . " Minerva Swan , " she said . " Erastus Hutchins , " said he . He made a little bow . He should have looked comical , a little fat man trying to bow gracefully , but he looked gallant enough to her . " Charmed , " he said . " Indeed . Sit down , sit down . Ilave you ever written a book before , Miss Swan ? " " Yes , sir , but not published . But I 've had my stories printed in The Ladies ' Treasure and The Ladies ' Casket and The Jewel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah  --  of course , The Lowell Offering . I have seen it . Amazing . " He shook his head . " Why is it amazing , sir ? " Of course she knew why , but she wanted to hear it from him . He gleamed at her . his eyes were very dark , piercing ; they seemed to say that he knew everything , although of course he did not and he quite openly admitted it . She found that trait most admirable and refreshing.  |p240He  laughed . " Never mind . You know as well as I , as well as the high muckety-mucks who employ the young ladies who  --  ah  --  write it . But I warn you "  --  and he shook a fat finger at her  --  " I want no Offering stories here . No Ladies ' Treasure for me , miss . We 're not that type of house . We want punch at Hutchins and Ross  --  we want punch , and zip , and turnthe-page . " He patted her thick manuscript , which lay on the desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three Years in a Cotton Factory . It was at page four that the heroine , Chastina Farnsworth , made her fatal decision to run away from a life in domestic service to work in a cotton mill . For the first time , Minerva wondered whether she should have put that incidenton page one . " How long have you been at Lowell ? " he said . " Eight years , sir . " " That is a long time . " " Long enough , yes , sir . " " You know the place well . " " Yes , sir . " He flipped quickly through the pages , stopping now and again to read some passage more slowly , as if to reassure himself of the page-turning qualities of Chastina 's story . Minerva looked around his office . It was a small room with two windows overlooking the busy street . The desk was piled high with manuscripts and printers ' proofs ; the bookshelf crammed , books overflowing onto the floor . A single picture hung on the wall : an etching of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storieshave punch enough even for Hutchins &; Ross . After a few moments he looked up and contemplated her . He reached behind him and took a new volume from a cluttered table . He handed it to her . " Have you seen this ? It 's just out . " It was American Notes for General Circulation by Charles Dickens . " No , sir . " " He visited your city . " " Yes , sir . I saw him as he toured the mill . " " Indeed . " He grinned at her . " Then as you may know he was quite enthusiastic about it . He said that you all had pianos in your boardinghouseparlors , circulating libraries , Lyceum lectures . He said that you were all ladies of high culture . " Minerva shrugged . " Many people have visited the cotton factories . Many are impressed by what they see . They come through on tour . Some of them spend as long as a day , even two days . Then they go back where they came from and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , Miss Swan . Even two days . ' That 's very good . And I take your point . " He tapped his fingers on her manuscript . " From what I see here , you do well to write under a pseudonym  --  ah  --  "  |p241He  turned back to the title page . " Matthias Simmons . Yes . A man 's name is much more suitable for this kind of  --  ah  --  writing . The public would not stand for a lady 's name  --  a female name  --  on such a book . " He srniled at her , very jolly . " Obviously you are tired of working in a cotton factory . " She had not put it quite so bluntly to herself until that moment , but as he spoke she realized the truth of what he said . She was tired ; and , tired or not , if her book were published , pseudonym or not , the identity of its author would no doubt soon be discovered and she would be dismissed at once . Better to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be blacklisted if she tried to stay on . " I am tired of it , yes , sir . But I must live . And so until now I have earned my living there . " " And from now on  --  ? " " I would like to think that I could live  --  even as Mr. Dickens does  --  from the proceeds of my pen . " Mr. Hutchins surveyed her up and down , and suddenly she rememberedMr . Dickens ' well-published complaint during his American tour . American publishers pirated him , he said ; he received no payment from copies of his books printed and sold in the United States . She blushed , overcome by her tactlessness . " It is a highly uncertain income , my dear Miss Swan . The public is fickle in the extreme . It clasps an author to its bosom one season , and the next it will not buy his work , no , not if he were Shakespeare resurrected , climbing down from his place there on the wall " In her confusion she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew well enough that the female public adored stupid tales of romance , but she had done with that kind of story . She could no longer bear to write what seemed so false an account of women 's lives . If Mr. Hutchins advised her to cater to that public , she thought , she would reclaim her unwanted manuscript  --  she thought of it as her child , her poor unwanted orphan  --  and retire again to Mrs. Clapham 's and live out her days in silence . Her soul rebelled at the idea , and yet " .. . fifty dollars , " Mr. Hutchins was saying . And , when he saw that she had not heard his previous statement , he repeated it : " I will pay you fifty dollars for the copyright to this manuscript . I will publish it . PerhapsI will lose money , perhaps not . It is impossible to tell . But I think that the appropriate time to bring out a book like this would be in the next six months , after the public has had its chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make an  --  ah  --  interesting contrast to his . Timing is everything . A year from now would be too late . " She glanced at the clock on the wall . Three forty-five . When the factoriesstarted up again , this time would be only halfway through the long afternoon in the weaving room.  | " One thing more , " he said . He tilted so far back in his chair that instinctivelyshe moved to help him when he crashed to the floor . But of course he did not crash ; he knew just how far he could go . He looked suddenly thoughtful , very grave . " She lives in the end , " he said . " Yes . " " It is not the convention . She should more properly die . They always do , these heroines who  --  ah  --  do not conform to Woman 's proper role . Eitherdie or marry . I prefer a good death scene , myself , with about a twopagespeech of remorse from the young lady . " " This one must live , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad person . " Hm . No . Well . I trust your instincts , Miss Swan  --  or should I say , Mr. Simmons ? Yes . Now : what are you going to do ? You agree to my offer ? " " Yes . " " Good . You will have ten copies complimentary . Some publishers give only five . But "  --  again he waved his finger at her  --  " you must immediately begin another . At once . Today . Do you have a subject ? A sequel , per-haps ? " " No . Well  --  not exactly a sequel . Another view , possibly . " " Again the young lady , her trials , her struggles , et cetera ? " " Yes . " " Good . It always sells . Try to have her die this time . Now you listen to me . You go back to your boarding house and you take up your pen and you write the first chapter tonight . Tomorrow you hand in your notice . More important , tomorrow you write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a place to live when you leave the factory ? " " No , sir . " " Come to Boston , then . " He reached into the drawer of his desk , shuffled among the clutter , and took out a slip of paper upon which he scribbled a few words . He handed it to her . " This will introduce you to Mrs. Hathaway . She keeps a respectable boarding house in Bowdoin Street . You will be quite comfortable there , and she will bring you good luck . She has boarded several of my most successful authors . " She took the paper . He stood up , held out his hand . " My clerk will give you your money . Lysander ! " A spry youth poked his head around the door . " Fifty dollars for Miss Swan . Have her sign the receipt . " The head withdrew . Mr. Hutchins gave her a stern look . " Remember , Mr. Simmons , you must work ! No idling ! I do n't deal with geniuses here , I deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll tell you when you die that you 're a genius , but while you live , you live on work . "  |p243She  heard the click of the money box in the outer room . As she went out the clerk handed her a small heavy pouch . She felt its weight ; her heart lifted . Hail Mary , full of grace , the Lord is with thee ; blessed art thou among women , blessed is the fruit of thy womb , Jesus ... . Patrick said , why , Biddy ? What happened ? But Biddy could n't bear to tell him . She wrapped the ring in a bit of cloth and put it into his hand . She saw his look : as if she had put a knife into him . Why , he said . Come outside , he said , and we 'll talk a minute . The store was crowded , only one clerk there besides himself . No , she said , I ca n't talk . And it was God 's truth : she could n't . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , he said , and have n't you done well for yourself up there with the Munsons . It was me that got you the place , he said . And this is how you repay me ?

Look what he gave me  --  all this money . How could she tell him it was that same one , and he gave her money , too ? Get out of the store , he said then . That woman 's got to you  --  Mary McCormic . Father Mahoney said not to go there , but you 've been all along , have n't you ? She put you up to this . She shook her head , unable to speak . This was none of Mary McCormic'sdoing . Get out , he said , or I 'll call the constable an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears . She went away , then , she went back to Munson 's and took her things , her notice already given , and went to the place where the gentleman said he 'd fetch her . And he did , he came and lifted her into the carriage and took her to the place he had ready and put her down all gentle and held her close and told her that she was his salvation , his only hope . And she was , she knew it , had known it from the first . Something in his eyes when he looked at her . 0 God : was it a sin to save someone ? She had kept him alive . But for her , he would have left it all , the mill , the house , everything . That wife of his . At night Biddy could see the lights of the city across the river , and she thought of him working there , making it all go , and coming to her after . Five months , and now the snow fell . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mary , mother of God , pray for us sinners , now and at the hour of our death ...  |p244Listen  , said Mrs. Clapham . They 're talking turnout again . Sabra hardly heard . She sat alone at the long table as Mrs. Clapham cleared away the remains of supper . In the hall a group of women huddled , whispering . Troublemakers , said Mrs. Clapham . Agitators ! Have you seen the Advertiser ? Rivers of blood in the streets , they say . The English weavers at Fall River are petitioning for Ten-Hour , they say . The English are foreigners , they have no right to petition . Nor have our American girls . They will all be dismissed and who will take their places ? The Irish ? Sabra did not reply . Her back ached badly ; she concentrated on gatheringher strength to stand . She was dizzy , exhausted . I must get upstairs , she thought . I must sleep so that I can work tomorrow . In the morning she would vomit again , as she had for weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could not work past the New Year and she needed to earn as much as she could until then . 0 Silas , she thought : what am I to do ? You look flat out , said Mrs. Clapham . Get upstairs . That young man , she thought . Where 's he got to ? Even Winfield did n't know . Sabra , desperate , had written to Concord to inquire . Somewhere in the Western Reserve , Winfield had answered ; sooner or later he 'll come back . But not soon enough , thought Sabra . Whenever he comes , it will be too late . And when I must leave , where will I go ? Who will take me in ? I hope it 's not Minerva Swan you 're worrying over , said Mrs. Clapham . Matthias Simmons indeed ! I wo n't have that book in my house . I understand that the girl lives in the end . Disgraceful . No decent girl will come to the city to work after reading a book like that , all suffering and gloom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last worried glance at her boarder , she departed to her kitchen chores . And after a while , Sabra found the strength to rise and go upstairs to bed . Not much time now : every day , every hour brought her closer to departure . When she handed in her notice , Mr. Critchlow said that he was sorry to see her go . But he could not meet her eyes : his wife had just borne him another child . On Christmas Day , after the other girls had gone to work , Sabra packed her small trunk , said a brief good-by to Mrs. Clapham , and walked to the American House to meet the unemployed teamster whom she had hired to take her to her destination . In her reticule she had ten dollars and seventy-five cents.  |p247Dee|p  winter . The small red farmhouse lay half buried in the drifted snow . In the barn the solitary ox waited out the shortened days until the return of spring , when he would work again . From the chimney of the house rose a thin spire of aromatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the farm was inhabited . No one came or went ; no neighborscalled from the villages of Harvard or Still River . Through the white days and long silver nights the three inhabitants endured . They heard the bitter wind roar down from the north ; they listened as it buffeted the house , thudding against the windows and whistling and moaning around the corners and down the chimney as if it would vengefullybatter down the walls and whirl away those safe and snug within . It might have been the voice of all the hostile world outside , mocking them , trying to destroy them . Survivors of a lost campaign , they were reluctant to come forth to surrender . They sat by the fire : a man and two women . The man , Amos Brown , had stayed at the farm because it was a refuge from those who persecutedhim because he would not shave his beard . " The old Jew , " they called him . On his rare visits to the surrounding settlements , small boys pelted him with stones . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrested on a warrant of complaint by a neighbor who had been offended by his beard . Brown was ordered to shave the beard or to pay a fine . He refused to do either ; goaded beyond endurance by the neighbor'staunts , he had at last struck a blow . He was jailed for more than a year . The experience strengthened Brown 's determination . He liked his beard . He would keep it . When he heard of the colony assembled by Pike and Trueworthy , he had walked to the farm and presented himself . They had gladly taken him in despite his agnosticism , his lack of fervor for their holy cause . They had not realized that running a farm would be so much work . They had anticipated long days free from the distractions of city life during which they could discuss and contemplate and refine the articles of their faith . They had not imagined themselves scrabbling in the fields . And then , just when they had begun to grapple with this new issue  --  the working of the farm  --  Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , if not with open arms , then at least with quieted consciences . The beard was of no consequence ; what mattered were his strong arms and hack , his knowledge of how to plant a seed and nurture it to fruition . Even his insistence on the ox came , in time , to bep248forgiven , when they saw how fast their meager supply of food was being consumed . All through the golden autumn , through the harvest of the small crop of oats and rye , apples and pears , Brown had stayed and worked : silent amid the eternal conversation , steadfast when , with the first chill of winter , the faithful had begun to drift away like the cheated remnants of an audience at the end of a disappointing entertainment . And when finally he was left alone , he resolved to stay on and work the farm and open the door to wayfarers , to the world 's dispossessed , even as it had been opened to him . He was not alone for long . In mid-December , before the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barn , repairing a piece of harness , when he heard a loud knock at the kitchen door of the house . Emerging to greet the caller , he saw a woman of perhaps thirty-five or - six , fashionably dressed in a blue , fur-trimmed pelisse with a matching blue bonnet and fur muff . " Sorry , ma'am , " he said . " No one 's t ' home . " She started at his first words , her hand dramatically flown to her bosom ; then she relaxed a little and surveyed him . " You are at home , I see , " she said . Her voice was high and sweetly challenging : the voice of the determined charmer . " Where is Mr. True-worthy ? " " Gone , ma'am . " " Gone ? " She took a few tentative steps across the yard toward him ; as she came nearer he could see that she wore  --  yes , certainly  --  a spot of color on each cheek . Her brown front curled improbably from beneath the brim of her bonnet : surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But  --  that 's impossible . How can he be gone ? He knew I was coming . I wrote to him . Where is he ? " Brown lifted his broad shoulders and dropped them again . " He went to Harvard Village for a few days . He may be back in Concord now . " The woman glanced around the deserted farmyard . Her bright , expectantlook had hardened into an expression of calculation . She seemed to debate with herself for a moment ; then she smiled at Brown engagingly and held out her hand . " I am Lizzie Crabbe , " she said . " I am one of Mr. Trueworthy 's most devoted admirers . I knew him in Boston , years ago . You are  --  ah  --  ? " Brown introduced himself and even took her hand , releasing it at once . In the moment that he met her glance he saw that her eyes were blue , very bright , illuminating her heart-shaped face . " How do you do , Mr. Brown , " she said . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have missed all the excitement . " " Yes , ma'am , " he said . " Though the excitement was pretty well over by the end of the summer . The last couple of months were pretty grim . "  |p249She  gazed up at him with a gratifying show of interest . " Is that so ? But how very sad  --  I thought it was all going so well , I thought it would go on forever . " " No , ma'am . They was n't up to it . " " But you must tell me all about it , Mr. Brown . " She turned and walked toward the house ; automatically he accompanied her . " Did they quarrel ? " she said . " Did they find an error in their system ? " " They did . " They came to the kitchen door . Swiftly she caught up the small valise which she had deposited on the doorstep and allowed him to usher her , the first of his wayfarers , across the threshold . In the days immediately following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the best of his understanding the reasons for the failure of Moses Trueworthy 's dream , there came a moment when both of them accepted the fact that she would stay awhile . One evening after supper , as they sat by the hearth , Brown was attempting yet again to explain the collapse of the Consociate Family . He sighed deeply , staring at the fire , loath to live again the last unpleasant weeks of Trueworthy 's presence , and yet feeling that he owed at least some account of the debacle to this tardy devotee . " He did n't bargain on Jasper Pike , you see , " he said . " And Pike  --  Lord , what a man !  --  Pike did n't bargain on her . Those two hated each other . Maybe they always did , I do n't know , I never knew either of ' em before this past summer , but they hated each other then , sure enough , and both of ' em was ready to fight to the death , if need be . " " Fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in harmony . What would they fight over ? " " Him . " Their eyes met and held , even as their faces flushed . " Yes , " she said at last . " I see . I had not realized  --  but then , one can not always know these things . I met Mr. Pike only a few times . I sensed in lrirn.some disquiet , some desire  --  but not that , " she added quickly . She laughed a little to conceal her embarrassment . " Where did he go ? Back to England ? " " Not so far . There 's Shakers not five miles distant . He went to them . " " Ah . Yes . The celibate life . " She looked down . " God 's chosen . " " So they say . " And Mr. Trueworthy was deeply grieved at his departure ? " " Deeply grieved  --  at something . The failure , more likely . He tried to die . Ile failed at that , too . " " How dreadful . To try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . How  --  ? " " In the barn . No , not a rope . He just climbed up into the hayloft and would n't come down . " She shook her head in disbelief . " Poor , poor man . And yet , such will , such self-control  --  how did he come out , finally ? "  | " They talked him down . Mrs. Trueworthy and the children . Just stood there and called up to him . Took turns . When one got tired , another one 'd come . Told him they needed him , and the world needed him more  --  although it was the other way around , if you ask me . In time he gave in . Came down . Ate something . Told me they was leaving  --  everyone else 'd gone by then , this was just after Thanksgiving . Told me I could stay on if I liked . I said I would , for the winter at least . " She nodded sympathetically . " It was very good of you to stay and watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place is as good as another to me . It 's peaceful here . The land 'll give good harvest if it 's tended proper . " He gave her a sudden grin . " And the ox do n't mind my old beard . " A log broke , fell , showered sparks . The wind rose and thumped against the house . They heard the tap-tap of the dry tendrils of the Dutchman's-pipe scratching at the porch window . It occurred to him to inquire about her plans , now that her mentor had fled . He looked at her . She sat opposite him quietly enough , her face averted , the brown front , which had been genuine after all , carefully arrangedon her forehead . Only her hands belied her serenity . They lay tightly clenched in her lap , white-knuckled , betraying . And so he did not ask her anything . Instead he leaned forward ; she turned to face him . " I could use some help come spring , " he said , " if you 'd care to stay . Plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely I wo n't . I been botheredenough in my time not to want to plague anybody else . So you 're welcome , if you like . " He knew nothing about her , this small , cheerful woman whose happy exterior only just failed to conceal a loneliness equal to his own . " You are very kind , " she said slowly . " Actually  --  no , that is not true . I was going to say "  --  again the embarrassed laugh  --  " I was going to say that I have many invitations to pass the winter , many friends who want me to visit . But it is not true . I have no one . No place . " He nodded , satisfied that his judgment had been correct . " You are very kind , " she said again . It was ( and he understood this ) her highest praise . A week later they celebrated Christmas . Earlier in the fall , after their own small harvest , Brown had hired himself out to neighboring farmers . Now he collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They dined on it , and on apple and berry pies , and on nuts and apples and cider and a very creditable plum pudding . Afterward they sat , as had become their custom , beside the fire . Lizzie Crabbe worked at some halffinishedknitting of Mrs. Trueworthy 's that she had discovered in her bedroom bureau . It seemed to be a child 's muffler ; she could sell it , she thought . Amos Brown whittled a piece of birchwood into a fantasticalp251creature which he thought he might try to sell also . It had snowed the night before , stopped during the morning , and was snowing now again as darkness fell . They felt snug and secure , sitting by the fire ; the haven which Lizzie Crabbe had anticipated had not materialized , but this very different refuge was not unwelcome . The travails of her existence had not prepared her for kindness unencumbered by favors expecteddemanded  --  inreturn . She could not quite believe her good fortune in finding Amos Brown in place of the philosopher whom she had come at last , weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her soul by casting it at Trueworthy 's sandaled feet ; instead , her soul was tending itself while her body took shelter and sustenance under Amos Brown 's kindly wing . She put down her needles for a moment and watched him as the wooden figure emerged under his skillful hands . She had often envied the serenity  --  realor contrived  --  which she had seen in other women ; now , unexpectedly , she had come upon it herself . She smiled at him , about to speak , when she heard a knock at the front door . At first she did not recognize the sound . She thought it was a loose board , an unclasped shutter banging in the wind . But Amos got to his feet at once and went to answer . Was it one of the village folk , perhaps , come to harass them ? She heard Amos ' voice , and then a reply . Hastily she rose and went to see for herself . On the narrow porch , indistinct in the fading light , stood a woman  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind Brown , he stood aside to let the stranger in . She stepped across the threshold while Brown snatched in her trunk and slammed shut the door against the winternight . " Quick , " said Brown , " get her some coffee . She 's half froze . Never mind  --  I know her  --  here , girl , have this "  --  and he took Lizzie 's shawl from a peg by the door ; unwrapping the stranger 's own , he put the dry one around her shoulders and led her into the parlor . Lizzie hurried to fetch the coffee warming at the kitchen hearth . She returned to find Amos settling the new arrival by the fire , clucking anxiouslyas he rubbed her frozen hands . Lizzie was aflame with curiosity : who was this person ? Why had she come ? But she held back her questions , and went to fill a plate with leftoverpork and apple pie . The girl 's first words had been an inquiry for Adelaide Trueworthy . When Brown told her that Mrs. Trueworthy had gone , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat quietly , her face expressionless , allowing them to tend to her . Somewhat embarrassed , Brown confessed to her that while he remembered her face , he could not recall her name . " Sabra  --  Mrs. Blood , " she said . " Right . You came one day with that young fellow to visit . And youp252was  --  " He stopped when he saw the expression on her face . He avoided Lizzie Crabbe 's avid eyes . Later he would tell her , when they were alone . She would not say why she had come . Her pale face took color , her numbed hands warmed and held her cup ; her eyes focused . At last she allowed Lizzie to take her upstairs and help her into bed . Before they had reached the top of the stairs Lizzie knew everything important about this girl , although she said nothing , merely watching with a newly sharpenedeye as Sabra climbed heavily , unsteadily before her . Lizzie opened the door to a small back bedroom . At once they heard a scurry of tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could see nothing . This had been Rufus Larned 's room , Brown had said ; he had lived entirely on crackers , some of which , apparently , still remained to give sustenance to the nonhuman population of the farmhouse . Sabra made no reaction to the sound . After a moment she took the candle from Lizzie 's hand and walked into the room . It was a desolate place : a small bed , a chest of drawers , a framed quotation on the wall , and both it and the wall stained from leaks in the sharply sloping roof . " Temperance is the Harald of Holiness , " it read . Sabra put the candle on the chest and sat down on the bed . The room was very cold , its air musty and stale . In one corner was a small open box : the container for the mice 's feast . " I 'll fetch you another blanket and a hot brick , " said Lizzie . " You just sit . Tonight you 'll have a good rest , and tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabra . She looked around the room as if she had forgotten for a moment where she was . " Go ! Whyever go ? We 've plenty of room here . You can stay until  --  " Involuntarily her glance traveled to Sabra 's waistline . " Until you 're fit to get about , " she finished lamely . Sabra sat quite still , her head bowed . " That wo n't be for some months , " she said . " I came because Mrs. Trueworthy said if ever I needed help  --  " " Mrs. Trueworthy needs help herself , now , if you ask me , " said Lizzie . " A fine mess they made of it here . Mr. Brown 's the one to manage this place . Come spring he 'll have it all planted proper , and a good harvest in the fall . So think about staying on , at least for a while . " She went then to fetch the blanket and the brick . When she returned she found Sabra asleep , curled up like a child against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brick under the blanket and took the candle with her as she left . Poor creature , she thought ; and she went downstairs to confer with Brown about their new charge . She found him clearing away Sabra 's meal . She watched him for a moment and then said : " She must stay , Mr. Brown . You know  --  do you know her condition ? " He had not , until that moment . He paused , holding the coffeepot andp253looking at her with an expression of such dismay that she could hardly refrain from laughing . " You must n't worry , Mr. Brown . We 'll manage . " IIe shook his head ; as they settled themselves again before the fire , he told her of the wedding in the orchard , and the daisy crown , and Trueworthy'sblessing . Lizzie was briefly enchanted , but she promptly forgot her delight in the scene as she considered the missing bridegroom . " Where is he , then ? It 's ridiculous  --  to marry someone and go off  --  " " He 's preachin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's what they do , those folks  --  preach and preach and preach . The world 'll fall down around them and still they 'll go on preachin ' . He 'll turn up , still yappin ' . I wonder what he 'll have to say to her . " Snow fell heavily during the night . By morning it had drifted halfway up the windows . Even if Sabra had continued in her resolve to leave she could not have done so ; but after her long sleep , and a hearty breakfast , she allowed herself to be persuaded to stay . It was not as if she were imposing , Lizzie said : " We 're glad of the company , and since you 've no place  --  " No place : no refuge but this . Her breath fogged the window ; she rubbed a spot clear and looked out across the endless white wasteland . They might have been on the moon . Somewhere , beyond their imprisonment , was Silas . He did not know where she was ; she had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clapham 's , surely he would guess . He would come . She closed her eyes and said a brief prayer  --  not so much to Cod , but to herself , willing herself to be strong . To live however she must . To see him again . She turned to find Lizzie and Brown watching her with some concern . She managed a smile . " Yes , " she said , " very well . You are very kind  --  " " There , " said Lizzie , reaching out to pat Sabra 's arm . " It will be all right  --  there ! " The winter passed . Snow fell , and fell again , followed by days of brilliantsun , blinding light on the white landscape ; by clear bitter nights when the stars glittering in the black sky seemed close enough to shower down . Sabra wondered occasionally what it would matter if they did . Ifp254the Apocalypse came now , she thought ; if our lives ended , if we went to sleep forever  --  surely not burning in Hell , simply an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped  --  ? She felt sleepy most of the time . She felt bewildered : lost . She had been transformed into a drowsy , heavy stranger whose body had contractedsome monstrous disease , who struggled powerless to control its growth . She had against her will embarked upon a perilous voyage whose destination was bloody pain ; she knew nothing , thought nothing of the prize for making that journey . She could not envision the future ; her mind was clouded . She lived each day not looking beyond the next . She waited . It was a hard winter , the worst in memory . The annual thaw never came . February was colder than January . March brought more snow . It seemed that spring was lost forever . Brown spent many hours in the barn , companion to his ox . Once in a while he wrapped himself in his old greatcoat and his long muffler and broad-brimmed leather hat and walked the three miles to Harvard Village to the general store and the post office . He had a small supply of his own money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , through the winter , he expended it for coffee and tea for all three of them and a little tobacco for himself . The villagers despised his beard still , but since his fellow eccentrics had gone away they did not regard this single man as a threat . They knew nothing of the two women with whom he had so kindly shared the shelterof the farmhouse . Had news of this new arrangement , this miniature experiment , reached their ears , they would undoubtedly have found anothercharge on which to arrest him , a charge far more serious than wearing a beard . Every day , now , Sabra felt the life turning and kicking inside her . As the weeks passed , she began to wonder about it ; she became ever more curious to see it . To get it out . To be herself again : a separate person . To hold it ; to see its face . She no longer thought of Silas . She thought of the child , whose birth would bring back her own life . " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , " said Lizzie Crabbe . " You can leave the baby here with me . You must find him and bring him back . " She was a practical person who had learned well the ways in which a woman survived in this world . The preferred way  --  but not her own  --  was to have a husband . Sabra sat staring at the fire , drowsy and contentedly full after the middaymeal . Brown , for lack of any better occupation , had gone upstairs to lie on his bed and contemplate his existence ; in fact , as they all knew , he would soon be asleep . Outside , a light fall of snow had turned into a blizzard . Sabra had become so accustomed to their being held prisoner by the winter 's storms that she hardly noticed new snow . Sometimes she thought that she must have been there always , and would be there for/ever ; for the rest of her life , she thought , she would live in the small rooms of this farmhouse , listening to the snow beating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sabra ? Are you sleeping ? " " No . " She roused herself to glance at her companion . In the weeks since she had come , Lizzie had been as a mother to her , or a kind older sister . I am lucky , she thought , to have found her in Mrs. Trueworthy 's place ; Mrs. Trueworthy , for all her good will , would never have had the time , the strength to care for me as Lizzie has . " Well , then , " said Lizzie . She peered at the neatly numbered calendar which Brown had made and hung on the wall . " This is February twentyfifth . By June you 'll be well on your feet . The baby can live on the bottle for a few days . You must go to Concord . You must demand to see him . " " He will come to me here . He will know that there is nowhere else I could be . " " Men do not like unpleasant surprises . " Sabra heard the warning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do . He thinks that he is coming back to a wife who will have been at work all this time . How will he feel when he sees his wife dependent , with a dependent child ? " " I do n't know . We never talked about-about a family . " Lizzie contemplated the girl seated across from her , the heavily burdenedbody , the bright , pretty face framed in irrepressibly curling brown hair . Sabra looked very young , and quite helpless as women always looked when they approached their time . " So he may be displeased . " Sabra returned the older woman 's stare . " He is a good man , Lizzie . How can he be displeased ? It is not our choice . It is God 's will when a child comes . He must accept it . " Lizzie allowed herself an unladylike snort . " He must do nothing of the kind . You are n't even legally married , from what Mr. Brown told me. 0 , I know  --  in your own way you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his . But in a court of law it would n't hold for a minute . These men are fond of setting up all kinds of grand schemes to lead folks to a better life , and I 'm in agreement with them as far as that goes . I came here myself to join Mr. Trueworthy . But sometimes they forget that they 're dealing with real human beings , not a set of chessmen on a squared-off board who can be moved around any way they please and nobody the worse for it . From what I understand , Mrs. Trueworthy had a hard time of it here , for all her husband and Mr. Pike thought they 'd planned everything so carefully . And it 's the same with you . It 's all very well to marry , either the way you married , or in a church or what , it 's the intention that counts . But dealing with the consequences , that 's another thing . They do n't always take the consequences into account , these phi/losophers . I ca n't say I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was going away again  --  no need to take on , Sabra , these things need to be talked out sometimes . Now listen : he 's bound to come back sometime soon , unless he 's had some sickness or injury out there . We 'll worry about that when we know for sure . But for now we 'll assume he 's coming home in the spring . What are you going to do then ? Go into that Community he 's been working for ? " " Yes . " Sabra stared down at her hands clasped together on her swollen belly . The baby gave a sudden lurch ; she felt it against her hands , she watched the rippling movement under her calico smock . " I 'll vow he 's an Owenite , " said Lizzie contemptuously . " They all are , nowadays , all these Community-minded men . Mr. Owen is in great fashionwith them , and his son as well . If they were the ones who suffered the consequences , they 'd drop that blathering old Scotch fool like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about ? " " I  --  yes . " Sabra felt her burning cheeks , far too hot to have been warmed by the fire . " Of course you do . And do n't tell me it 's God 's will that you 're with child . It 's Robert Dale Owen 's stupidity , that 's what it is . Now when your man comes back , he 'll try to practice that way on you again  --  listen to me , Sabra , do n't turn away from me . If you plan to spend the rest of your life in Mr. Winfield 's Community , that 's all well and good . It 'll be better than the factory for you if they go at it the proper way . But you 'll have your work cut out , too , and you do n't need to weaken yourself in the bargain by dropping a baby every year . That 's right  --  you do n't need to . " Although Sabra 's face was still uncomfortably warm , her instinct for self-preservation had overcome her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . " There are ways to protect yourself , Sabra . Do you know that ? Of course you do n't . No one ever does , until it 's too late . Now you take my advice . I know what I 'm talking about , never mind how . While you are at Concord , or better yet , perhaps you should take the stage to Boston  --  it 's that important , Sabra  --  you visit an apothecary and you buy a female syringe and some white vitriol . You dissolve a lump of vitriol about the size of a chestnut into a pint of water . Immediately after your husband has  --  ah  --  performed the act , you fill the syringe with the solution and you douche yourself . Yes  --  down there . Not once but three times . You must clean yourself thoroughly . Do you understand ? " Sabra nodded , still unable to meet Lizzie 's eyes . " Yes , " she murmured . She had never heard of such a thing . She could not imagine  --  Struck by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it not wrong , Lizzie , to interfereso with Nature  --  ? " " Interfere ! " Lizzie 's voice cracked with indignation . " Mr. Owen 's wayp257interferes , too , does n't it ? The only difference is that his way does not work . No woman is safe with an Owenite in her bed . Have you ever heard of a Dr. Knowlton , Sabra ? " " No . " " He is a Boston man . He wrote a little book on checks , some years ago  --  on the means by which women themselves may prevent conception . He wrote it all out very plainly  --  the syringe , the white vitriol , everything . The authorities were very angry with him . They put him into prison for his trouble . They might better have given him some public reward . He is a far greater benefactor than all the philanthropists in the city put to-gether . " " Many doctors say that women should have as many children as they can . They even recommend childbirth as a cure for consumption . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Lizzie , " and they do n't bleed to death when one of their theories goes wrong . " She laughed shortly , looking slightly embarrassed now herself . " Well  --  now you see why I am not received in polite society . Moses Trueworthy was my only hope , when I came here . I am so outspoken that no one else would have inc . I was staying with the transcendentalists at West Roxbury for a time , but even they , as open-minded as they are  --  or think they are  --  drew the line at Dr. Knowlton . The moment I mentioned his name , I was politely asked to leave . They are trying very hard to be respectable . " For all her proselytizing , she did not dislike babies . She had often wanted one herself . But the means to care for it  --  to bring it up free from hunger and want , to live without the nagging worry of where the next meal was to come from  --  yes , that was the problem with babies . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , and nothing in the world , it seemed , was less sure than that . Several weeks later , as they sat together one evening , Sabra tried to rise and could not ; and then the weakness , the feeling that her abdomen was falling apart , transformed itself into a long , slow pain , not great , but an intimation of the struggle to come . She moaned in surprise ; she sat hack . " There , " said Lizzie . " It 's begun . It may be false but we ca n't know , so let 's get you up to bed while we can . " Gently , firmly , she helped Sabra to her feet . Together she and Brown got her up the narrow stairs , Lizzie all the while keeping up a soothing quiet chatter  --  not so much for Sabra 's sake , for she thought that Sabra would do well , but for the easing of Brown 's worry . Much to Lizzie 's annoyance , he looked very frightened . Why were men such fools about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endure it ? " That 'll be all right , now , Mr. Brown , " she said when they reached the door of Sabra 's room . " Go down now and make some coffee and I 'll call you if I need you . Everything will go as it should . "  |p258And  , having dismissed him as tactfully as possible , she helped Sabra into the room and set about the business of the night 's work . Pain enveloped her . Pain caught her up and shook her and smothered her and threw her back , exhausted , only to seize her again , too soon , beforeshe had time to summon up her strength to withstand him . All the long night she gave herself up to him . In the dim and flickering light of the candle she was aware of Lizzie 's face hovering over her , Lizzie 's voice speaking soothingly to her , Lizzie 's hands holding hers giving her the power to endure yet another onslaught . Once , twice , she saw Amos Brown 's face loom anxiously , peering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not understand . Once , during a respite , she thought of her mother , who had suffered this to bring her into the world , whose own mother had suffered , and her mother and all women back into time : and who had died , birthing a little corpse . Please , she cried . Please . The baby was born with the first light of the sun . Sabra saw it through a mist of fading consciousness : a tiny wet pink snorting thing , dark hair plastered across a miniature skull . Lizzie was enchanted . Expertly she tied off the cord and cut it . She wrapped the baby in a scrap of worn flannel which she had carefully washed several weeks ago ; she held it for Sabra to see . " A girl , Sabra . Look , how perfect she is ! Can you hold her ? Ah  --  there ! See how she knows you . " The baby did , indeed , seem to know that body from which so recently she had been separated . She ceased the tentative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she lay quiet in Sabra 's arms and then found the breast and suckled . And lived . Sabra lay back and watched her child . She had not yet emerged from her long dream ; she was not yet herself . But she had , now , this charge , this treasure ; she would be separate again , but never again alone ; she would be herself , but more than she was , vastly enriched . In that cold littleroom , in that lonely farmhouse , refuge for outcasts , she felt as if she had , after a long journey , come home at last . And against all teaching , all reason , all knowledge of the world , she was glad of a girl . " You need to drink now , " said Lizzie . " Mr. Brown is makLu somep259gruel , but just take this first . Careful , do n't spill on her  --  o , Sabra , is n't she precious ! " Lizzie beamed as she held the hot tea to Sabra 's mouth . " What will you call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys ' names ; she 's as sweet as a little rosebud . Would you call her Rose ? That 's right  --  drink it all . " Sabra thought for a moment ; the tea had greatly revived her . Although she felt very tired and knew that she must sleep , her brain had begun to clear . " Clara , " she said , trying it ; and instantly she heard it , she knew that it was right . Clara closed her eyes and went to sleep . With infinite care Lizzie took her from Sabra 's arms and nested her in a blanket-lined drawer . Sabra slept . For a week and more the baby thrived while Sabra regained her strength . On the tenth day she sat on the edge of the bed and then stood and took a tentative walk , a few steps to the window and back . She longed to see the outdoors again , although snow still covered the ground . When she returned to her bed and lay back she felt as if she had gone a great distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , she thought of Silas . She called him up to the front of her mind : she saw his tall , lanky form , his thin face , heard his flat sardonic voice whose tone changed drastically only when he was in the presence of those few whom he considered his superiors : Trueworthy , Winfield . Suddenly she longed to see him . Ah , where was he ? He must be told of his child : he must see her . A week or two more , she thought , and I will ask Mr. Brown to take a letter to Harvard Village , to the post office . I will write to Mr. Winfield again . Surely by that time he will have news . She closed her eyes , comforted by her resolve . We are safe here for a while , she thought ; and come spring , come summer , the Community will begin and we will have our home . One afternoon several days later she was awakened from a half-dream , half-drowse , by Lizzie 's anxious voice . " Sabra  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once she was alert , sitting up . Lizzie had lifted Clara from the drawer ; now she gave her to Sabra . " She ca n't seem to open her eyes , Sabra . And look , she 's gone so pale . Her little hands are stone cold  --  " The baby did not awaken ; she could not nurse . But they felt a heartbeat  --  faint , fluttering , but still discernible . " Mr. Brown ! " Lizzie 's voice was harsh ; she fought down her panic . He came upstairs in a rush , hearing the urgency in her call . He looked at Clara , lying still in her mother 's arms ; he looked at the two women who seemed to think that he could help . IIe could not help : he knewp260nothing of babies , nothing of doctoring . But  --  yes . He knew where they could go . " Bundle up , " he said sharply . They stared at him as if he had uttered a profanity . " That 's right  --  we 're all goin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-packed an ' it 's not too cold today  --  about freezin ' , maybe . Quick , now ! We still have a good four hours of light . " He remembered Sabra 's condition . " If you ca n't walk it , missus , I can carry you and Miss Crabbe can carry the baby . " Somehow , despite her weakness , her trembling fear for Clara 's life , Sabra managed to put on her clothing ; they wrapped the baby deep in a blanket and somehow they got out of the house and across the meadow to the road , where the snow was packed down hard and they could walk with some ease . After a time Brown lifted Sabra and carried her ; Lizzie panted on beside , cherishing her precious burden . At last a farmer drivinga sled came upon them . Because he did not know them , he volunteered to take them on ; and when he heard of their need , he drove them to their destination . Dutton Street was quiet as a tall young man dressed in plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , had anyone passed to see it , was pale and drawn beneath his high , dark beaver ; it wore a determined expression , as if he had an important errand to perform ( as indeed he had ) , as if he were unmindful of his wet and muddy boots , his spattered trousers . Then , too , his face showed the effects of a lingering fever which had severely weakened him and from which he had only recently recovered . He climbed the three wooden steps of Number Five . After pausing for a moment , he firmly , resolutely , pulled the bell handle . He heard the echoing tinkle inside the house ; then the footstep of the respondent . The door opened a few inches . Mrs. Clapham peered out at him . " No salesmen excepting Saturday nights . " " Excuse me  --  Mrs. Clapham  --  you may remember me  --  " Her hand went quickly to her mouth , whether in joy or fear it was at first impossible to tell ; then the light in her sharp eye betrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it 's Mr. Blood , is n't it ? Come in , do come in  --  my , it 's been a while since we 've seen you ! It 's nasty cold still , but we 'll be warm soon enough  --  " She talked him into the house ; without actually touching him , she steered him into her private parlor . Despite the imminence of the noon bell she could not abandon him . She was too eager to hear what she thought he had to say . " Now just sit down . I must know all about Sabra . How is she ? We miss her terribly , she was such a good , sensible  --  " Her voice wound down like a machine which had lost its power . " What is it , Mr. Blood ? Do n't tell me she 's ill ? Where is she ? " He was too surprised to lie . " I assumed that she was here , Mrs. Clapham . " " But  --  no . No . She left us on Christmas Day . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They stared helplessly at each other , bound for an instant in their commondilemma . " I thought she was with you , " Mrs. Clapham finished lamely . Silas shook his head . " No . I have just returned from the West . I have not seen her  --  I did not know  --  she said nothing more ? No address , no hint of where she might have gone ? " " Nothing , " said Mrs. Clapham . " I 've been hoping for a letter from her these past two months and more . It 's not like her , not to write . She 'd know I was thinking of her . " Images flooded his mind ; memory consumed him so that although he heard her voice he did not understand the words she spoke . The meadow in the hot July sun ; the orchard in the moonlight ; Sabra in her crown of flowers ; the happy faces wishing them well . . . . But no , Trueworthy had gone , the experiment had failed , Bountiful was no more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blanketed by snow , the silent , empty rooms which only last summer had heard such confident , hopeful voices . All gone now ; except  --  perhaps " Excuse me , Mrs. Clapham , I am sorry to have troubled you . It was a pleasure  --  no , do n't see me out=Mrs . Clapham 's curiosity , aroused so quickly and now frustrated so cruelly , made her more bold than ordinarily she would have dared to be . She followed him into the hall ; she plucked at his sleeve . " If you stay to dinner , Mr. Blood , I 'll ask the girls . Someone may have heard and just forgot to tell me  --  " " No . You have been very kind . Good day to you  --  " Ile escaped . As he hurried down the steps he heard the noon bell . He quickened his pace ; he did not want to get caught up in a mob of hungry operatives . Bountiful : that ill-begotten child of Trueworthy 's fancy , of Pike 's obsessions  --  abandoned now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could she have gone ? And why had she gone at all ? Why had she left her employment with no word , no message for him when he came ? She had no one in the world to whom to turn  --  certainly she no longer had the Bradshaws . That very isolation , that loneliness , had been part of her attraction , had made her seem more vulnerable and therefore more desirable . For the ones whom we can most easily hurt are the ones to whom we are most often drawn ; the well-defended fortress , strongly set about with guards , does not invite invasion . He felt something brush against his cheek . He looked up and saw the first soft white flakes falling gently , inexorably , from the iron-gray sky . The Elder 's hands were large and strong , hardened by long years of work ; and yet he handled Clara so tenderly , so kindly , that she did not cry when he took her , nor when he unwrapped her and felt carefully her tiny limbs , touched her painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps she is beyond feeling , thought Sabra . Perhaps she has already passed the line between life and death . She does not feel anything ; Death has called her and she goes now to him and leaves us here behind to suffer her loss , to mourn her little life . They stood in the Dispensary , an anxious audience to Elder James ' ministration . The afternoon light had brightened for a moment as the sun made a last brief appearance following the shower of snow . Now as the golden disc descended behind the mountains the light faded fast . Sabra was aware of Lizzie Crabbe 's heavy breathing beside her as she tried , with remarkable success , Sabra thought , to wait patiently for the diagnosis , the blessed herbs which would lessen Clara 's travail . Amos Brown stood stolidly , his eyes like theirs fastened on the tiny patient whom he had entrusted to the wisdom of this colony of Mother Ann 's disciples . He did not know , nor did he care , if Harvard Village held a doctor . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off your leg as quick as look at you , too anxious to get on to the next patient to attend properly to the one at hand . And never  --  and this was the worst of it , to Brown  --  never admit that the illness passed their understanding . These people were different . For all their arrogance , for all their maddeninginsistence that they must renounce God 's world in order to surviveit , they were honest  --  or perhaps self-confident  --  enough to admitp263that sometimes God sickened a body beyond their ability to heal . What was more , their very other-worldliness , their spirituality , seemed to give them a kind of insight into material things , thus enabling them to diagnosewhat a gentile doctor could not see . ' Take her , please . " Carefully Elder gave the baby to Sabra and turned to the shelves of labeled bottles filled with dried herbs which lined the wall beside him . He hunted for a moment and then selected one and poured a small amount of its contents into a porcelain mortar . He ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clara lay wrapped in her blankets : still , white , cold , hardly breathing . Lizzie Crabbe leaned over to look at her . " She 's not in pain , Sabra , " she whispered . " Be thankful for that . " Sabra nodded . Her throat hurt too much to speak . In her mind she heard a voice : her own . Dear God . Please let her live . Dear God . Please . She felt a sudden guilt at thinking the prayer . This was God 's will . Everythingwas God 's will . What right had she to challenge it ? She must accept , she must resign herself . God had a reason for making Clara die . That reason might never be made clear to her , but she must accept it , humbly , as His wish . No . She started as Lizzie touched her arm . Elder James was speaking to her . " Bring the little one here . Now . This will be a surprise to her , but we will help  --  so  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution of the ground powder  --  Sabra saw the label now , it was " Dittany : Cunila mariana "  --  and now he held a spoonful to Clara 's pale lips . Gently he eased it between them ; some of the liquid dribbled out , but some  --  enough ?  --  went in . Clara choked . Sabra held her up , patted her back , put her down again for another spoonful . Clara swallowed automatically , coughed , and lay still . " Now , " said Elder James , " we will put her to rest and you shall eat supper with us . Then we will look at her again . " He took Clara and laid her on a small cot in a corner . Expertly he rewrappedher blanket , stretched another over her , and tucked it in tightly at the sides . As he straightened to his full height , Sabra noticed that he was almost as tall as Amos Brown . And  --  she had not seen it before  --  a handsome , well-made man . He was kind , intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought . She was aware of Lizzie Crabbe beside her . But no  --  she had forgotten . These were God 's elect , they did not couple . As they followed him out of the room it occurred to her to wonderhow a celibate had such knowledge of handling babies.  |p264The  horse was badly winded . He had ridden her too hard , but his anxiety , his sure knowledge of Sabra 's whereabouts , had made him careless of the animal 's welfare and , indeed , of his own . He thought only of Sabra : why had she left the factory ? Had she had some problem with her health  --  a nervous collapse , a weakened lung ? No : Mrs. Clapham would have known of it , she would have told him . His concern was overlaidby annoyance . He needed every penny , now ; he had returned confident of her thrift , sure that again she would have saved a purse for him . Over the winter , as he talked his way from town to town , from city to isolated frontier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , about his work ; like all such new awakenings , it would die aborning if he had not the money to give it life . He had counted on her to help him . It seemed impossible that she might not . By the time he reached the Harvard Road , the sun had set ; as he urged the horse up Prospect Hill through snow-covered woods and meadowshe saw the rising moon , a flat , battered silver disc in the ultramarinesky . Had he not been on so urgent a mission he might have stopped to admire the landscape , if not to rest the horse ; but tonight he was oblivious to natural beauty , to kindness . He must get on to Bountiful . When he reached the place where the meadow stretched down from the road to the farmhouse , he reined in and surveyed the scene below him . The house was dark ; no light anywhere , no smoke from the chimney . But where was she , if not here ? He looked again , and saw what he had missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than one person . Intruders ? Vandals come to set the place on fire ? He listened : the wind whistled through the bare-branched trees along the road . He heard no other sound . Painfully , stiff with cold , he dismounted . He walked into the meadow and bent to examine the tracks . He saw that he had been mistaken : the footprints led away from the house , not toward it . One set was very large , heavily indented ; two were smaller , less distinct , partially swept over by the afternoon 's snow flurries . Three people had left the farm . The tracks stopped at the hard-packed snow of the road . Impossible to tell if they had walked or ridden after they crossed the meadow . And in which direction  --  ?  |p265The  horse snorted and shifted her hooves . He spoke softly to her as he remounted . Carefully he guided her down across the meadow , avoiding the marks in the snow . He could go no farther tonight . He would take shelter , and stable the horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed open the heavy barn door . Moonlight streamed across the well-swept floor . The horse snorted softly . He needed to tend to her at once or she would founder . From the interior he heard the scraping , clumping sound of a hoof : another horse ? Why had they walked when they could have ridden ? His eyes searched the stalls and found a massive , bulky form : not a horse . A cow , an ox  --  no matter , evidence of the farm 's habitation , a guarantee that someone would return . He led the horse into the next stall but one , unsaddled her , began to scrape her sweat with a scraper which he found hanging by the gate . Outside the stalls he found a bucket of water . He let her have two or three mouthfuls ; then , throwing his greatcoat over her blanket , he began to walk her up and down the aisle under the indifferent gaze of the ox . At last he was able to put her back into her stall and leave the barn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow in the yard was bisected by a shoveled path , the kitchen door unlocked . The house was cold . He felt along the mantel and found a box of lucifer matches . A whale-oil lamp stood on the table . He lit it and looked about . By the embers in the hearth stood a coffeepot . He picked it up : half full . Straightening , he held his breath for a moment , straining to hear a sound of habitation  --  a foot stepping on a creaking stair tread , a door opening on rusted hinges . He called a warning : " Hallo ! " No answer . For a moment he felt uneasy . If he suddenly turned , would he catch Trueworthy 's linen-smocked figure flitting around the door frame ? If he listened carefully , would he hear Trueworthy 's sandaledfeet slap-slapping along the bare floorboards , counterpointed by the murmured syllables of his endless discourse ? He took a deep breath ; he steadied himself . Nonsense ! Best see to provisioning . He took up the lamp and carried it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat , a barrel of apples , several loaves of bread , a large , half-eaten cheese . He set down the lamp , took the bread and cheese into the kitchen and returned for the light . He laid a fire and set the coffee to warm . Whoever had stayed on at Bountiful was a good housekeeper . Hungrily he bolted a slice of bread , and then another accompanied by a piece of cheese . It occurred to him that despite the silence , someone  --  some real person  --  might still be in the house . Might be waiting upstairs after hearing him come in ; might be frightened enough to come down armed with a weapon  --  the ones who remained might have none of Trueworthy 's open hospitality . He listened again : no sound . Still : bust be careful . He took the lamp and climbed the stairs . He lookedp266into each small bedroom ; he saw no one . In one of the rooms the bed was rumpled , unmade , the covers thrown back ; and in that room , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went downstairs again . The wind rose , buffeting the house . He was glad of the fire . Wait , he thought . They will come back . They arrived at mid-morning , a little caravan deposited at the top of the meadow by the Brother deputed to drive them in a wagon . Silas saw her , saw that she carried something  --  a blanket-wrapped bundle . He saw the alarm on their faces at the smoke from the chimney . He stepped out onto the porch to greet them . The word went out from Father Miller : October 22 , 1844 . The world will end that day . Christ will come in His flaming chariot , He will snatch up to Heaven those souls which are saved , He will consign to endless Hell everyone else . They had pestered him unmercifully to set the date . He was afraid : once , twice before he had announced it and nothing had happened . The sun had risen at dawn and set again in the evening ; the sky had remainedinviolate , unbroken by the appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds , the oceans rose and fell with the turn of the tide , mountains and valleys remained unshaken , cities stood firm where they were built . His humiliation had almost killed him . He had withdrawn , retreated from public view . He had beseeched his God to enlighten him . He had worn down countless pencils to tiny stubs , he had used up reams of paper , figuring , calculating , tracing out endless mathematical formulae into webs and spirals of squiggly numbers ; and then , still unsure , he had figured all over again and  --  dear Lord !  --  had come out with a different answer . The poor old man was half mad with his arithmetic . Eyes glazed , hair rumpled , cravat untidily hanging loose , lips mumbling and mutteringas he struggled to add and subtract , to divide and multiply  --  hurry ! Hurry ! His followers nagged at him , they questioned him every day , they hungered insatiably for the blessed numerals which fell from his dry , swollen lips . He calculated until he could calculate no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  no , not if the answer had meant his own salvation.  |p267There  it is , he said : that is positively the date . Mark it well ; prepare for the end . The army of the faithful had their uniform : long flowing white robes , carefully stitched to the tune of a millennial hymn , carefully folded away until the hour of judgment . Where shall we await Him , asked the believers . Hilltops and graveyards , came the answer ; on village greens , in the peace of your homes  --  await Him where you will , but make ready , for the day is at hand ! Array yourselves , alert yourselves ! Dispose of all your worldly goods , make amends with your enemies , flock with us to the highest hill , seat yourselves among the tombstones  --  for the dead will rise , as well , and you must be prepared to welcome them . All through the summer the agitation swelled in the hearts of the faithful . People left their work to pray ; as autumn drew on , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were left to rot while peoplemade their peace with God ; old debts were settled , quarrels made up , property given away in anticipation of the end . In the farmhouse at Bountiful , Lizzie Crabbe sat in the light of Mrs. Trueworthy 's whale-oil lamp and stitched a Millerite robe . Insects buzzed and fluttered around the narrow glass chimney ; Lizzie liked them no more than anyone , but she hardly noticed them now , so intent was she on her task . Sabra sat across from her , sewing a little sacque for Clara ; from the darkness of the porch , through the open windows , they inhaled the pungent odor of Amos Brown 's pipe . Sabra would have liked to ask Lizzie about her coming journey , but Lizzie , so voluble about affairs of the flesh , was strangely reticent about her recent spiritual adventure . She had gone one evening to a Millerite meeting at a nearby farm . How she had learned of it , or why she went , she never revealed . When she returned to them she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had seen visions which she could hardly comprehend , let alone explain to her companions . Sabra had missed Lizzie 's friendship , for Lizzie now was caught up in a new existence , and her previous life meant little to her . She sang snatches of Millerite hymns as she performed her chores ; she was to be seen at odd moments kneeling in prayer ; she had taken to scribbling littlelists on scraps of paper . My sins , she said when they asked her what these were . I have so many that I must write them down to keep track . And still , for all these outward signs of piety , Sabra was not convinced that Lizzie 's conversion was real . Why is she doing this , she wondered ; for like all manias , the Millerite craze was incomprehensible to those unafflicted by it . Lizzie would tolerate no questions , no arguments . " I have seen the light , " she said ; and that was that . Sitting with her now , Sabra felt as though she sat alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self sat calmly sewing in the lamplight . Lizzie 's spirit had sprouted wings ; she wandered in the vast heavens , she listened to hear the footsteps of the Lord . The newest member of their household had claimed the departed Trueworthy 's study for his own . He sat there now , as he did for long hours day and night , wrestling with his manuscript . It was a denunciationof everything he had done , every word he had spoken for the past five years in Winfield 's service . To compose it was very difficult ; he wracked his conscience by the hour , he held up to the cold light of objectivescrutiny every idea , every value , every tenet he had proclaimed in Winfield 's name . All of it had been wrong  --  foolish beyond description . They seldom saw him . The formulation of his arguments took every moment of his waking hours ; he had little time to talk to anyone and in fact he had not spoken to Lizzie at all since he had discovered her sudden , new-found devotion to Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Bountiful . He had thought to stay with Winfield until he had completed his dissection of that good man 's philosophy  --  a traitorous act , as he admitted to himself , but no more than Winfield deserved for unashamedly taking five precious years of Silas ' life in the pursuit of his phantom Community . Winfield 's dream would never be . Silas wondered that the man himself did not understand that fact . Winfield 's Community was a paradise of the mind ; it would never be lived . Increasingly , with each swiftly passingday , Silas felt the urgency of warning people against all such false prophets  --  against Winfield , against Father Miller , against the struggling transcendentalists of Brook Farm , the isolated communities of Shakers , against Graham of the unbolted bread and Fowler of the phrenological bumps , against Moses Trueworthy and his garrulous solutions to the world 's ills , against the industrial Edens , so-called , of the factory towns  --  all of them were in error , all doomed to swift and certain failure . The shock of Clara 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could not understand how so brilliant a man as Robert Dale Owen could have given wrong directions . Had he , himself , made some error , some miscalculation ? He searched his memory , his conscience . He was sure that he had proceeded according to Owen 's prescriptions . What had gone awry ? How had Clara come to be ? He had had no choice but to stay at Bountiful . Without money , withoutprospects for money , he knew that he was fortunate to live on Brown 's generosity . " Stay on , " Brown had said . " You do your work , I 'll do mine . " And so Silas had retreated to the study to compose his warning , his denunciation . In his winter 's travels , he had collected a fat notebookof statistics : the numbers of steel workers at Pittsburgh ( and how many unemployed ? ) ; the numbers of seamstresses in Philadelphia ( and how many starving ? ) ; the shoe workers at Lynn , printers and carpentersp269and hatters and plasterers and all the hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of redemption , had lost their land to the banks and insurance companies . Now he addressed himself to these unfortunates , as well as to those who would help them . Be cautious , he said ; be not deceived by empty promises . Beware the eloquent philosopher who approaches you with outstretched palm . He will retreat in haste , once he has had your contribution ; you will not see him again this side of Heaven . And all the while , as he was struggling with his task , all the long bright summer and through the mellow days of fall , he had struggled with the other problem , too : the question of what to do about  --  what to do with  --  his unexpected little family . As soon as he finished his manuscript , he had a further task awaiting him . Sabra and their child had no part in it . Soon , now , he must tell her . He had no idea where he would find the necessary words . All his words went onto paper now ; he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many days he hardly spoke to her . She did not seem to mind ; or at least , she seemed to accept his taciturnitywithout resentment . He was aware that she was entirely preoccupied with the baby . Lizzie Crabbe gave her good company . Amos Brown bothered no one . Silas knew that he could not have asked for a more propitious place in which to work . And yet he was restless  --  anxious to be away again . As September drew to a close and October ate away the days before the winter 's onslaught , he began to chafe and fret . He must be gone again  --  farther , this time , than ever before . Soon he must tell her , advise her what to do while he was away . At least , this time , he would not leave her victim of Owen 's mistakes  --  or his own . That fact , if nothing else , would comfort his conscience while he was gone . He had not touched her since his startled embrace upon her return from the Shakers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was with matters of the spirit , of the mind , he wanted nothing to do with those of the flesh . Lizzie Crabbe had changed bedrooms with them so that he and Sabra occupied a larger bed , but he might have lain next to a stone for all the feeling she aroused in him . He remembered dimly his brief passion of the previous summer , but that feeling had belonged to another man , not himself as he was now . He was consumed , these weeks , by passion of a very different kind . It had nothing to do with a woman 's body . His organ of regeneration was as superfluous to him now as his appendix . It never occurred to him to wonder what Sabra thought about his behavior . She left him well alone : that was all he asked . For her part , she waited , as she had waited all the long winter before . She lived in a dream with her child . She was content to be as she was . Soon , she thought ; soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then we will begin . She had not followed Lizzie 's advice ; she had not purchasedp270the items prescribed by Dr. Knowlton . I will ask Silas ' opinion , she thought , the first chance I have . In late September , on an uncommon day of cold rain and wind , Lizzie Crabbe left them to go to a Millerite family in Groton . When she had gone  --  with promises to write , with fond hopes to meet in the next world , a tearful kiss for Clara , a whispered word of encouragement to Sabra  --  the house seemed unbearably empty . Sabra returned to the kitchen and looked at the closed study door . And now , for the first time , she felt the small , warning tension of resentment . Sabra looked down . Below her , stretched at the base of the tree , lay Silas ; beside him , on a blanket , Clara . Both slept in the midday heat . She reached for an apple , plucked it , examined it . She took a bite . From her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , branches , the two motionlessfigures below . She considered dropping an apple on Silas ' head . No : he would awaken angry . She wanted no rancor to spoil the golden day . Indian summer : Nature 's gift before the long cold punishment of winter . Having experienced one winter at Bountiful she had no wish to live through another . Therefore : climb down and awaken him , not with a missile but gently , sweetly , so that he will not be in bad humor . She disengaged her skirts from the clinging branch and came down . He snored in small , soft explosions ; beside him , between his body and the baby 's blanket , lay his notebook . He had brought it along to work in it , consenting to leave the room where he had labored all summer only if he could bring his manuscript with him . He had worked too hard all summer , not fully recovered from his illness of the winter before . But he had been driven , insistent ; he must finish it , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She leaned over and blew a strand of hair from his forehead . He winced and turned his face toward her . " Silas , " she whispered . He opened his eyes , looked up into hers . She had hoped that he would smile when he saw her , but he did not . After a moment he sat up . " How long did I sleep ? " " Not more than half an hour . " He frowned . " Half an hour too long . "  |p271Eyes  downcast , she accepted the reproof and tucked it away in a corner of her mind . She must not encourage argument . There were more important things to discuss  --  to disagree upon , if need be  --  than the length of his nap . She composed her face ; she smiled . " Silas . " He looked up at her . He had taken up his notebook again and begun to read the last words he had written : ... and so we denounce these principles of Communality for what they are : vain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon not for their own worth but because of the miserable circumstances of the lives of those to whom they are presented . Any new idea will be acclaimed by one who has no hope . Such acclaim does not validate the idea ; it simply confirms the hopeless situation of him to whom it is offered . . . . " The words rang true . But he must continue , must not lose momentum , must not allow himself to be deflected . He lifted a curious eyebrow , toleratingher . She sank to her knees beside him . " Silas , what are you going to do when you finish that ? " He contemplated her . He had hoped that her question , inevitable though it was , would be delayed for a week , a month , until he had finished his manuscript . Until that day , he did not want his mind distractedwith questions , arguments , plans " I shall go on , " he said . " I thought you said that you were no longer sure about the Commu-nity . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am downright against it . " " Well , then  --  " " By go on , ' I mean go on with the way which I see clear before me . " She squinted slightly to show her attention . She sat before him , her skirts billowed out around her , her hair tousled , her cheeks flushed with the warmth of the sun . False warmth : each night grew colder . " What is that ? " she said at last . If only he would speak openly , freely to her as once he had done ! These last weeks he had hardly talked to her of anything , let alone of his work . He seemed to have retreated to a privatecountry ; she did not know how to enter it , she did not know the language . He glanced at the sleeping baby . He hoped that she would not awaken . How strange , to see himself in such a tiny creature ! He had not yet become accustomed to her ; he thought that possibly he never would . He turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . If this had to be the moment , so be it . Sooner or later she must know . " Sabra . I must leave soon . No  --  do n't speak until I 've finished . I want you to understand . There is a new way open , and I must follow it . I mustp272go to France . No  --  please  --  wait . There is a system there which I must study . A new plan for living  --  an organization far superior to anything we have here . The disciples of a man named Fourier are organizing groups called Phalanxes . If I can master this plan , and bring it back , I will have achieved more than I ever dreamed  --  certainly more than I could have done at the side of Henry Winfield " He looked away across the meadow to the dark red farmhouse . He saw Amos Brown come out of the front door and walk into the apiary . He felt Sabra 's eyes upon him . If she utters one word of reproach , he thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave now , today . I have worked too hard , suffered too much to listen to the laments of a female . She said nothing . She waited obediently . " I am called , Sabra . I can not resist , it is not my choice . I am called and I must go . The work must be done . All about us the country sinks into a hell of poor workers , a hell of hungry folk whose lives are controlled by a few powerful men who grasp at the throats of their workers and squeeze the life out of them and then cast them aside like so much refuse . There must be a better way for people to live . This country was not intended to be another England , another rotten edifice where only those few at the top can breathe , and all the rest , at the bottom , must suffocate and die . " He sat up straight ; his eyes glowed as he warmed to his subject . AlthoughSabra dreaded what was to come , she was so relieved to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he said . Say it , have it out , but tell me , tell me " Listen to me , Sabra . Do you know that in New-York and Boston there are women who work days as long as you worked in the factory  --  no , longer , sixteen , eighteen hours  --  women who sew shirts and who get fifteen cents a day ? Do you know that in Pittsburgh the iron workers are near starvation , and that in New-York two thirds of the laboring classes live on a dollar a week ? Mr. Greeley , in the Tribune , advises them to quit the city altogether and go West . This injustice is against Nature , Sabra , it is against God ! It can not continue . We will have bloody uprisings , we will have a revolution which will make old Sam Adams ' doing look like child 's play ! Mr. Emerson speaks of self-reliance . Tell that to the men and women who went on strike in Boston this past summerneedleworkers , tailors and tailoresses who are paid so little for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity . How can they be selfreliantwhen they can not live by their work ? You must understand how my heart bleeds for these poor people , how I long to help them . I can not rest if I do not save them from their misery . It is my calling , and I must follow it . " She felt the slow , tentative stirring of rebellion in her head . Shep273thought of the closed study door . She remembered Lizzie 's words : " Men do not like surprises . " " What about Clara and me ? " He seemed to flush ; or perhaps it was only the warmth of the day , the warmth of his emotion for the world 's oppressed . " You must not think that I have not considered you . " " No . I do not think that . " 0 , Silas  --  ! " You  --  ah  --  I will take you back to Lowell . You can board in a private home , you can find a wet-nurse , you left with an honorable discharge so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " His voice failed as he saw her face . " No . " " Sabra , it is the only way . I must go , I must learn the organization of the new system , and the men who can teach it to me are in France . " " No . I will not go back to the factory . " " It is important that you earn money again . We will need it when I return . You must save every penny . " " I am your wife . I will not be separate from you . " She reached out , grasped his hands . She fought down her rising panic : months , years alone , shifting as best she could , waiting for his visits . No . No . Think : what will keep him ? She had seen his involuntary recoil as she touched him . Very well : let go his hands . There is another way . Do not beg , do not cling . " Sabra . Trueworthy is not a minister of the Gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep him he will flee all the faster . Therefore : draw him to you as honey draws the fly " And when he performed the ceremony it was a valid act  --  for me , for us . But it was not valid in the eyes of society . He had no right to do it . " You will suffer the consequences . But you will suffer anyway , any path open to you leads to heartbreak and pain , you can not let him go " Sabra , I beg you to understand . I did what I did because I loved you . I still do . But I must go , I can not stay here and do nothing . " Her fingers were stiff and awkward . She felt panic again , fought it down again ( do not let me fail because of a button ! ) , tore at the neck of her dress . Sleep , Clara , sleep " No ! " He might have been gazing on all the devils of Hell instead of her white flesh . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She leaned toward him . She seemed to be watching herself . Move slowly , gently , do not alarm himHe put her away so violently that for a month afterward she bore the marks on her shoulders . He sprang to his feet . He was appalled at her immodesty , at her display which , far from arousing him , only sickened and repelled him and made him long for the freedom of the sea , the fresh wind in his face , the comradeship of like-minded men which hep274was sure awaited him on the shores of France . She had revealed more to him , just now , than her woman 's body ; she had revealed her spirit , the workings of her brain . He felt suddenly cheated  --  tricked . Like all her sex , he thought , she was petty , narrow-minded , unable to grasp the larger issues . How could he have believed that she was a fit helpmeet for him ? She had not understood him at all , just now . She thought only of herself . " Put back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame yourself  --  " He took a step backward , narrowly missing Clara ; he turned as they heard Brown 's voice . " Halloo ! Come and see the parade ! " Brown stood in the front yard , pointing up the rising meadow to the road . A cloud of dust hung above it , raised by the feet of a white-robed throng which made its slow , shuffling way to the top of the hill . Snatches of their song drifted down : Now , hark ! the trumpet rends the skies ; See slumbering millions wake and rise ! What joy , what terror and surprise ! The last Great Day has come ! Sabra shivered . Walk across my grave . They moved on , pilgrims coilingupward preparing to meet their Lord . How calm they were ! How confident that in less than a week , now , the Apocalypse would come ! And in her desolation her heart went out to them ; she felt one with them , for her world , too , was about to end , and she was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or man 's . " I am the Word , " said Mother Ann . " It is not I that speak , it is Christ who dwells in me . I feel His blood running through my soul and body . " In England she had been a weaver in a Manchester mill . Reluctantly she had married ; in agony she had borne four infants . All had died . In her grief , she had understood the wrath of God : He had punished her for the sin of concupiscence . From that time she refused her husband . The marriage act is an act of sin , she said , even as the transgression in the Garden . She joined a group of Shaking Quakers . They were strange people , obsessed with the spirit of the Lord . In their ecstasy , they came out of their poor and humble homes to disrupt the Anglican services ,  |p275yelling  and dancing in the aisles of the church , scandalizing the staid congregation . The authorities put her into prison . She came out unrepentant . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the Bride of the Lamb . Follow me for I am your Saviour . " In 1774 she had a vision of a new land across the sea , a place to build her church . She took seven believers with her . On board the Mariah they danced and sang their worship . The captain was angry with them ; he threatened to throw them overboard . A storm blew up . It seemed that the ship might founder . Mother Ann looked up at the creaking , swaying mast and saw a golden angel . She told the captain that the ship would be saved , and so it was . From then on , he allowed them to sing and dance and shake as much as they pleased . In America they suffered persecution and want , and it was some years before they could separate into their own Community . They were accusedof being British spies ; they were thrown into prison , harassed by patriotic citizens , beaten and driven from place to place by angry mobs . Mother Ann suffered frightful indignities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to prosper . They founded their first Society at Niskeyuna  --  Watervliet , New York , near Albany . After the war , people began to come to them . Villages , or " Families , " were founded at Harvard Village and Shirley and Tyringham and Hancock in Massachusetts ; at Canterbury and Enfield , New Hampshire ; at Sabbathday Lake and Alfred , Maine ; at Enfield , Connecticut ; and , at New Lebanon , New York , the ruling Family . In the early years of the nineteenth century , Mother Ann 's teachings spread to the south and west . Families were established at Union Village and Beulah , Ohio , and at Pleasant Hill and South Union , Kentucky . By 1844 , more than . six thousand souls had chosen to join . Their fame spread ; people flocked constantly to see them , to observetheir curious ceremonies , to sample and buy their productswoodenware , herbs , seeds , cloth , foodstuffs . The visitors from " the world " saw the neat , well-constructed buildings , the great stone barns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The onlookers were called " gentiles . " Many of them could not understand how such a strange doctrine produced such obvious prosperity . Strange , indeed : celibacy was the rule , constant work and worship the way of life . Women had an authority equal to men 's : Elders and Eldresses jointly ruled the Families . No one was allowed to own anything , but no one ever suffered want . It was a doctrine of apparent simplicity and good sense : from each according to his ability , to each according to his needs . Later in the century , Elder Frederick Evans would send to Leo Tolstoy some Shaker pamphlets . They were received and read with great interest by that tormented soul seeking his own way to salvation . In 1837 , as the Mormons fought their way west guided by the angelp276Moroni ; as the transcendentalists struggled with the problem of the Oversoul ; as Father Miller spoke ever more urgently of the coming of the Apocalypse  --  and eleven years before the Fox sisters revealed their spiritualistrappings to a startled world  --  Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1784 , began to speak again to her children . They received her messages through chosen ones known as " instruments " ; her words were written down and called " gifts . " The hearts of the faithful swelled with joy at this new evidence of Mother Ann 's love . It is the beginning of a great revival , they said . Soon all the world will flock to join us , and Mother 's teachings will be fulfilled . Eldress Hannah 's eyes were brown : large , calm , peace-filled eyes , reflectingthe tranquillity of her soul . Intelligent , perceptive eyes : she saw at once that this new arrival would stay only awhile and then depart . This one had come , not with a strong heart to give to God , but a heart wounded by the gentile world , a heart in need of healing . And as for the infantEldress sighed . Infants were valuable . Perhaps , somehow , when the mother left ( as surely she would ) , they could keep the child . They sat in a small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before her on a straight-backed chair . She held Clara in her lap . Cold November rain dripped down the window panes ; the room was damp and chilly , lacking a fireplace and warmed only by a small box stove . From a drawer in the table Eldress took a small record book and a quill and inkwell . " You have visited us before , have you not ? " " Yes . " " And the baby has been well since then ? " " Yes . " Sabra dipped her head to look at Clara 's face ; instantly she was rewarded with a joyful smile , a little scream of delight . She hugged the baby , kissed her  --  causing another spasm of chuckles  --  and met Eldress ' eyes . Yes , she thought , I come to join you in your celibacy , but I am glad that I had her before I came . For I would have missed it all , had I come before ; and although I will have no more , I would not have missed hearingher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; therefore , poor as I am , I am richer than you.  | " Good . Now  --  your name again , please . " " Sabra  --  Blood . " Eldress , about to write in her register , caught the hesitation and looked up . " We must have your legal name . It will not be revealed to anyone outside this Family , but we must have it for our records . " " I understand . My name is Sabra Blood . " Eldress nodded , wrote a few words . " Occupation ? " " Weaver . " " Place of residence ? " " Lowell . " " Do you use intoxicating liquors ? " " No . " " You have been staying with the old Jew , have you not ? " " For the summer , yes . " " Were you a member of Mr. Trueworthy 's Community ? " " I visited it . " " But you did not subscribe to his beliefs ? " " I admired his goal . His means of achieving it  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . He is a most unusual man . 0 , yes , we knew him well here . We even entertained his disciple , Mr. Pike , about a year ago . They used to come now and then , sometimes with Mrs. Trueworthy and her children , and we would feed them . " Eldress shook her head . " A fine woman . Misguided , but admirable all the same . Well . " Her voice resumed its businessliketone . " Age ? " " Twenty-two " ' Place of birth ? " " I think it was Bennington . " " You think ? " Eldress contemplated her . There was something about her  --  something appealing , some quality of being a kindred spirit  --  that Eldress Hannah , for all her intelligence , could not have defined . " My father was an itinerant preacher . He told me several times where I was born . Once he said Bennington , once Deerfield , once Hanover . Bennington will do as well as any . " Sabra glanced down at the drooling baby on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a trickle of milk . Sabra mopped it with her handkerchief . Feeling better , Clara smiled widely at her mother . She had three teeth ; a fourth was just coming through . Sabra glanced at Eldress , anticipating the next question ; but Eldress seemed distracted . She sat quite still behind the table , the pen held above the notebook , her gaze resting upon the young woman and child before her . Disconcerted ,  |p278Sabra  looked away . The Shakers were supposed to be sensible people , not given to falling into sudden trance . What was wrong ? " Is your father still living ? " The voice was somewhat unsteady , fainter than before . " No . He died six years ago . " So long : it might have been a hundred . " And your mother ? " " She died when I was quite small . " Eldress blinked ; she bent her head to see what she wrote . She took a deep breath . She met Sabra 's eyes and smiled . Whatever struggle had taken place within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " You understand that you are to be taken in as a novice . If you decide to stay , we will ask that you consign to us your worldly goods . If you go , you may of course take what is yours . Do you have any money , any furniture , jewelry  --  " " I have seven dollars and thirty-three cents . " " Nothing else ? " " A few clothes . Some things for the baby . They are all in my trunk . " " Yes  --  well , I wo n't put those down . You may leave your money in our strongbox . It will be perfectly safe . " Sabra held up her small pocketbook , handed it across the table . Three meals a day , work , peace , solitude  --  the world would go on ( certainly it would , the Millerites having been confounded ) , but she need not suffer it . Here was her refuge , hers and Clara 's ; she asked nothing more . Would she , she wondered , emerge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been transformed  --  say , by Silas ? No ; never . He would make no difference . Eldress took the pocketbook and , rising , went to a closet and took out a large metal box which she unlocked with a key selected from a ring at her waist . She put the pocketbook into it , closed and locked it , and returnedit to its place on the closet shelf . " Very well . Now I will show you to the dormitory . The baby  --  wait , let me make a note of her name  --  Clara ?  --  yes , she can go to the nursery . I will have a Sister take her there . " " But  --  " Sabra remained in her chair ; her arms tightened around Clara 's small plump body . She had not foreseen such an abrupt separation . " She always sleeps with me . " Eldress ' eyebrows lifted in gentle surprise . " In the same bed ? Is n't that dangerous ? " " No , she had her own little bed , blankets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same here until she is big enough for a trundle . " " I 'm afraid that 's against our regulations . The other sisters would be disturbed . " " She 's very quiet , she sleeps through the night  --  "  |p279Eldress  paused by the door . " She must sleep with the children . It is quite safe ; a Sister has charge of them , she sleeps in their dormitory . You will be able to see her  --  to nurse her  --  whenever you need . Come , we will take her ourselves . " Sabra 's anxiety had communicated itself to Clara ; as she stood up and lifted the baby to her shoulder she felt the baby stiffen and cling , heard the first warning protests which promptly became loud and desolate wails . She followed Eldress out of the office building across a yard to one of two doors in a large two-story wooden structure whose plain , spare design made it seem , in the dreary rain , remarkably like an almshouse . Inside corridors led to either end of the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without knocking , Eldress opened a door and preceded Sabra into the room . It was filled with two rows of low cots , all neatly made , all save one unoccupied . A little girl of perhaps four or five lay at the far end of one row ; beside her sat a young woman sponging her face and talking to her in a soft voice . No , thought Sabra , not in a sick-room . She patted Clara , whose cries had subsided , and stood near the door . Eldress paused near the middle of the row and then went to the child 's bedside . She spoke to the attendant in a low voice ; directly she came back . " I thought that she had recovered , " she said . " Apparently she has taken worse . " She surveyed her two new charges with a worried look while Sabra wiped the baby 's tear-stained face . After a moment she beckoned Sabra into the corridor and shut the door behind them . " It is against the rule , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are fortunate that the others have not been affected . Although of course none are so young as this . " She stood so close that Sabra could catch her scent : strong lye . They were alone in the corridor . Suddenly Eldress held out her arms ; her face , encircled by her plain white cap , had a hungry look , an expression of sorrowful longing . " Let me hold her for a moment , " she whispered . Sabra was too astonished to refuse . Carefully she handed Clara over , hoping that the baby would not resent being given to a stranger . The baby did not resent it . She turned her face to the new face before her , she reached an exploratory , clutching hand to the brim of the cap , she chuckled and gurgled and dropped her face to chew on the large white kerchief draped over the shoulders of Eldress ' dress . For a long moment Eldress held her  --  a moment in which she seemed to have forgotten Sabra 's presence , the place where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her assessment of this woman . Who had she been before she heard Mother Ann 's call ? Were her arms the arms of a woman who had had babies and lost them ? Or the arms of a barren wife who never held a child ? No , she thought , that one is mine ; you cannothave her . They were all three startled by the sound of a bell being rung outside . With a sudden movement of alarm Eldress gave Clara back . " Supper , " she said , in not quite her normal voice . " Come along . You may bring her with you . I will take it up with the ministry . " Quickly she swept down the hall leaving Sabra to follow . The supper which Sabra ate that night was as good as any she had ever had at Mrs. Clapham 's , and far better than what she had eaten for almost the last year at Bountiful . Baked ham with raisin sauce , beans and bacon , potatoes , applesauce , tomato pie , saffron bread , pickled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pudding  --  here , she thought , here truly was Bountiful , produced by folk every bit as convincedas Moses Trueworthy that they followed God 's way ; but in this place , God 's way included strict attention to the tasks of this world , including the care of one 's physical needs . Clara drowsed on her lap while she ate . She was conscious of the stares of the other sisters at the long table ; she avoided their eyes . Althoughtalking was forbidden , she knew that in the absence of the two eldresses , Eldress Hannah and the other whose name she did not know , they would have spoken to her , questioned her . Like Mrs. Clapham 's , she thought , they are glad of a newcomer from the world outside . But at Mrs. Clapham 's , one had only to step into the street to be part of that world ; here , one was shut away forever while the world went on , all unknowing . She was assigned to packaging in the herb room . A number of sisters worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrious and silent , all dressed alike in their small white caps and crossed kerchiefs and drab gray dresses . She , too , had been issued the regulation costume . The strings of the cap chafed under her chin , and the shapelessness of the dress , even for one so little vain as she , made her feel curiously sexless  --  neutered . As it was intended to do.  |p281The  work was tedious , undemanding , inexpressibly boring . Worse : it was lonely , for conversation was not allowed save at prescribed times in the evenings . Sabra found herself uncomfortably alone with her thoughts . She had not foreseen this isolation in the midst of hundreds of souls . She had thought , when she left Bountiful , to find a different kind of life : busy , gregarious , leaving her mind no chance to function . Now she sat alone with the others in the sweet-smelling herb room , pouring ground Elecampane root into small paper packets printed with the name of the herb , its properties and uses , its origin at the Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world : Comfrey Root and Queen of the Meadow , Spikenard Root and Feverfew , Poppy Flowers and Hyssop , Wormwood and Life Everlasting . From time to time Sabra glanced at the other women , her hands all the while continuing the motions of her task . Most of them did not notice her curiosity ; they sat with eyes downcast , no expression on their faces . It seemed impossible that they would concentrate so hard on their labor ; more likely , she thought , they were saying private , silent prayers , allowingtheir spirits to commune with the Lord . She herself was unable to do this . Try as she would to control her thoughts , she found herself reliving her last days with Silas at Bountiful ; and then , after he went away , her short time with Brown , when she realized that she , too , must go . She had once heard a girl at Mrs. Clapham 's speak of a " broken heart . " She had never understood the meaning of that phrase . But now , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full understanding of her situation came to her more clearly , she felt in her bosom , in the place where her heart had always beat , a throbbing pain which began with the rising bell before dawn , and burdened her all the day , and hardly left her in her restless sleep at night . She told herself that her heart would heal ; she trusted that in time her memories would sink beneath the calm surface of the new life , the new home to which she had fled with Clara . In the meantime , she endured her aching heart as she had endured her first difficult days at the Commonwealth Mill . It had been Brown who had suggested that she come here . He had watched her with concern after Silas ' abrupt and angry departure . He had understood the reasons for Silas ' bad temper : the young man wanted money , even as everyone else , and she had refused to board out her child while she earned it for him at the factory . Well and good , thought Brown ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grief , her reluctance to spend another lonely winter at the farm without even Lizzie Crabbe for female company . Lizzie had vanished from their lives . Brown had thought that she might return when the world had continued , after all ; but they saw no sign of her , heard no word . One day about two weeks after Silas had gone away , Brown had seenp282Sabra standing at the front window holding Clara and looking out over the gray November landscape . It was that dead time between the color of the leaves and the first fall of snow  --  the time , more than any other , when one feels that the earth will never again return to life , never again bear seed and sustenance . He had cleared his throat in a hesitant way , and then , failing to get her attention , he had spoken before his shyness could stop his tongue . " You can stay on here , and gladly , y ' know . That way , he 'll find you easy enough when he comes back . " She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He is n't coming back . " " You sure ? Seemed to me he said somethin ' about it  --  " " Yes . But he will not . Not for years and years  --  too long for me to wait . " " So what will you do ? Why not stay on here ? You know me well enough to know I 'm not hard to get on with , and the little ' un likes me . " He had extended a crooked , calloused , tobacco-stained finger to Clara , who promptly set to chewing it . Brown had never had a child , nor yet a wife ; but if this is the result of marrying , he thought  --  this small , gurgling , drooling mite  --  a woman might well be worth the trouble . He had no idea where he might find one . Sabra had held tight to her child while she thought of a reply . She had said aloud just then the words which for days she had heard in her mind : " He is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she to do ? She was fully sensible of Brown 's kindness , and yet she knew that she could not spend a winter alone with him on this isolated hillside . Nor could she bear to think of boarding Clara away while she earned a wage . How were they to live ? " Thank you , " she said at last . " But I think that perhaps I should go . " " Where ? You 've no family  --  " " No . But I would like to make some kind of life for myself . I can not just stay here and wait , and wait  --  I must do something . " She turned again to the window , but now her eyes were filled with tears , and she saw only a blurred , dun-colored smear beyond the glass . " I had thought that by now we would be safely in the Community , Silas and I. Now it seems that Mr. Winfield will never start it , and if he does , it will be withoutus . " Brown cleared his throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears unnerved him almost as much as their parturition . " You remember when the baby was sick , " he said , " and we went to the Shakers ? " " Yes . " " Well . If you do n't want to stay here  --  an ' I 've no hard feelin 's , 1 understandall right why you do n't  --  you might think of goin ' to them . Youp283can go for a trial time , to see how you get on . They 're good people , if a mite strange ; but it 's a life . " At first she had been astonished at his proposal ; then , thinking about it , she had come to see its merits . As Brown had said , she need not commitherself beyond what they called the novitiate . And even if she decided to stay on , Clara would not be bound by that choice ; she could make her own determination when she came of age . And in the meantimethey would have a home  --  a family , in fact ; they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cares of the world . The sticking point for most people  --  the ban on intimate relations  --  was nothing to her . Her husband had gone away . She needed nothing to do with any other man . And so now she sat at a table in the herb room and sifted powdered root into envelopes . She looked again at her co-workers , and this time she had an answering glance from a young woman across the table and clown two places . She might have been a pretty thing , if the principles of Godey 's Book had been applied to her ; as it was , attired in the Shaker garb , her skin innocent of soothing , softening lotions , her hair invisible under its covering cap , she was almost nondescript . Almost : but still her oval face held a shadow  --  a memory  --  of prettiness , and the faint smile on her rosy mouth gave life to her expression . Her eyes were brown , large , and deep-set , and they too revealed something more than the dulled , vacantlook of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she might have been a friend . Here she would remain unknown ; for friendships were not encouraged at the Family , and all one 's devotion went to God and work . Still  --  daringly  --  Sabrasmiled at her , and she was gratified to see a smile in return . A short time later the bell rang for the noon meal . In the afternoon , when Sabra had nursed Clara and tucked her up for her nap in the nursery , she saw that the almost-pretty girl was gone from her place in the herb room . As a novice , Sabra shared a dormitory with other newcomers trying out the Shaker regimen . There were , at the moment , ten new women ; the men 's half of the building had a novices ' room as well , but of course the women , and especially the new women , had no knowledge of the brethren'saffairs . Sabra did not know how many men , this autumn , were attemptingas she was to live this strange new life . The strangeness was not so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at Mrs. Clapham 's ; nor was it in the unrelieved , industrious routine , for she had always done her share of work wherever she lived . She puzzled about it in her hours in the herb room , her silent meals in the long dining room where all religiously cleaned their plates  --  " Shaker your platel "  --  even as they religiously kept quiet . In the evening gatherings where new hymns were learned , or portions ofp284Scripture read by Eldress for their edification , she watched the faces of these women  --  these disciples of Mother Ann . They seemed stranger even than she had imagined . Why ? They are like me , she thought . They have two arms , two legs , women 's bodies , women 's hearts : why are they as different from me as heathen Chinese ? As Indian princesses ? At the beginning of December , work assignments were changed in the monthly custom and Sabra was sent to the kitchen . Here she worked with a dozen other women to prepare the meals for the hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising , she liked the work : Sister Ruth , in charge , was a kind and gentle woman , perhaps forty years old , perhaps sixty , whose strict discipline of her troops was ameliorated by a sweet voice and an attitude of helpful encouragement . Under Sister Ruth 's supervision , even the clumsiest woman might rise to culinary heights hitherto undreamed of . From her little domain , three times a day , came dishes which would have caused any royal chef , had he tasted them , to curdle his blancmange in envy : herb soup , baked veal cutlets , chestnut pudding , mushrooms in sherry butter , saffron bread and lemon bread and pumpkin loaves , Rose Geranium rolls and butter orange fluff , chocolate cream cake , floating island , spiced cherries , pear honey ... . As it happened , the girl whom Sabra had noticed in the herb room had been assigned to the kitchen also . Sabra resolved to speak to her when she could . For several days she had no chance ; but then one afternoon , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the girl sat down beside her , knife in hand , and companionably reached for a turnip which she began to peel . It was mid-afternoon ; except for an elderly Sister at the sink , washing potatoes , the kitchen was deserted . " My name is Philomena Pratt , " said the girl abruptly , but in a quiet voice so as not to be overheard . " How are you getting on ? " Sabra introduced herself , and they talked for some minutes before the appearance of Sister Ruth reduced them once again to silence . But in the days that followed , they were able now and again to exchange a greeting , a few words of conversation , and so their acquaintance ripened into what passed for close friendship in that austere and self-contained Community , where only worship allowed release of human feeling , and all the heart 's affection went to Mother Ann . One evening toward Christmas , a party of visitors from Boston stayed unexpectedly to supper . Sister Ruth 's placid face took on a harassed look as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital details which could not be allowed to disrupt the tranquil order of the Family . " Sabra , put some of that beef onto a separate platter , " she said in a voice much sharper than usual ; " and keep back some of everything else . You 'll have to eat in the kitchen tonight , they 've ladies withp285them who were put at your place at table  --  you , and I think Philomena , she 's just taking out the tureen  --  yes . " They lifted down two slat chairs from the wall pegs and sat together at one end of the long worktable . From the open door of the dining hall they heard first Elder James and then Eldress Hannah saying grace ; then silence broken only by the soft clink of knives and forks against thick stoneware . Philomena had a brief battle with her conscience and lost it  --  and yet , so anxious to speak , still she hesitated . Then , whispering so that her transgression would not be overheard by the silent company without : " How is your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled at me . " " She is well . " " Do you  --  forgive me , I do not mean to pry  --  but do you mind not being with her always ? " They had little time ; the evening meal would be finished in a matter of minutes . Sabra had not the luxury of taking the few seconds to make a considered reply . " Yes , " she said . Some of the light went out of Philomena 's eyes . " What will you do , then ? " she said . " Will you stay ? " " I  --  I do n't know . I will try . " Philomena struggled again . " And your  --  husband ? He died  --  ? " " No . " She was aware of her aching heart which just now , oddly enough , ached somewhat less . " He did not die . He went away . He had what you might call a  --  " What ? She could not put a name to it . " A missionabroad , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise . " But if he is alive  --  why do you not wait for him ? Do you not want to live with him again ? " Her face suddenly flooded with color as she realized the implicationof her words ; but then , as willing to be hung for a sheep as a lamb , she hurried recklessly on . " Sabra  --  can you tell me how it is , to live with a man ? A husband ? Is it  --  is it  --  " She could not , finally , bring herself to ask what she longed to know . Sabra remembered Lizzie Crabbe , confronting her months ago with blunt advice . How would Lizzie have answered this painful inquiry ? " It depends , I suppose , " she said . From the dining hall they heard the scrape of chairs on the bare wood floor as the Family rose to pray thanks for the meal . " On what ? " hissed Philomena , leaning close . " On what does it depend , Sabra ? " " Why  --  on the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , carrying empty platters , the two women sprang apart like guilty lovers . No one noticed them ; promptly they rose and joined the others in the work of clearing the meal.  |p286It  was not until several hours later , after the evening meeting , that Sabra realized that Philomena 's oddly urgent inquiries had answered her own puzzlement about the nature of the Shaker women  --  that quality in them which had made them seem so alien , so different from most of the women in " the world . " Of course , she thought : the nature of women has to do with men . These women are at peace , they are delivered from the search for a man  --  a husband  --  which so occupies the thoughts of worldly women . No wonder they seem so calm  --  dull , even ; they have no need to be lively to catch some man 's eye . They can live independent of a husband'ssupport , just as the factory women can . But the work here is healthful work ; no one suffers lung disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no one goes mad from the noise . And no one has a child , said the voice in her mind ; and no one ever falls in love . To fall in love , to marry , to bear children  --  all the world 's teaching pointed that way , and were not these women , separated from it , therefore terribly deprived ? Therefore less ? Therefore , somehow , not quite human ? She lay on her narrow cot  --  a single cot , for there was no sharing of beds here , no chance of accidental contact with another body  --  and listened to the quiet , unobstructed breathing of the other women in the room . Tomorrow , she thought , will be the same as today ; and the day after the same again . She had thought that that monotony , that security , was what she had wanted : that , and time for her heart to mend . She had thought to learn from the example of the other women in the Family , to take strength and tranquillity from them while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who was not tranquil  --  perhaps not even strong . The discovery unnerved her . Even these people , it seemed , had doubters and backsliders . And if others doubted , so might she ; and if others backslidO Silas , she thought . She moaned aloud from the pain in her heart and the longing to put her arms around her child . O Lord , we worship Thee , and we dance and sing and shake out our love for Thee . For the spirit of the Lord is in us all , and the spirit of Mother Ann dwells in us , and gives us life.  |p287For  we are the children of God , and our lives we give for the salvation of our souls . Then sing ! Then dance ! In square-order shuffle and marching lines ; in ring dance and whirling gift , in cross and diamond and speaking in tongues , in warring gift to exorcise Old Ugly . Strange melody filled the meeting house ; the thud of stamping feet shook the well-made floor . Lines of swaying , jerking bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new designs . The room smelled of sweat and damp wool . The building vibrated with the frantic rhythm of the dance . The worshipers ' faces were faces in trance ; their eyes were glazed , unfocused , their bodies writhed and leaped in frenzied passion . The room had become the world : and all life was there , all love , all ecstasyin communion with God . There was nothing else . Sound and movement , movement and sound : come to us , Mother , come to us now , for we are the children of a free woman , we are chosen to mortify our flesh and crucify the demons of our lust . On a bench along the wall , Sabra sat with the other female novices and with those sisters too old or too ill to participate in the worship . At the far end of the room sat a similar row of brethren . As she watched the dance , she felt the worshipers ' ecstasy , she felt herself begin to yield ; almostagainst her will , her feet began to tap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God is holy , Mark 'd with Immanuel 's feet ; Every Sabbath since she had arrived , she had sat and watched the service . It had been explained to her that when she felt Mother Ann 's spirit enter her own , she would rise and join the dance . Until then , she was to sing the hymns which had been carefully rehearsed at evening meetings during the week , and attend the service as a spectator . Lust can not reach Mount Zion , Nor stain the golden street . Once , the Sabbath worship had been open to the public . Many had attendedas a lark , as they would have gone to a circus or a theater . Often they went away sobered and repenting their mockery ; they had felt the flame of devotion , the complete sincerity of these simple folk who had separated from the temptations of the world . If you will have salvation , You first must count the cost , And sacrifice that nature , In which the world is lost . But some years previous , in 1837 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children : a visitation from the spirit world , messages from Christp288in Heaven , from Mother Ann herself . It was the time of Mother Ann 's Second Appearing . And in their ecstasy they entered into a period of wild excess in their Sabbath meetings , and they saw that the visitors from the world did not understand their new fervor . Meetings were closed ; the world was welcome no longer . The singing stopped . Everyone knelt to pray . Gradually their hard breathing came easy ; their hearts returned to a normal beat . Their faces cleared . Where had they been ? They could not have said . They knew only that the spirit that had sustained them through the dance had gone away . Their hearts were empty now ; their eyes , which had seen visions of glory with Mother Ann , now looked once again upon each other , upon the plain blue and white interior of the meeting house , the stand of pines beyond the window , the dwelling house opposite  --  the everyday sights of the ordinary world . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen beyond . Next Sabbath they would make that journey once again . In the interval they would put their hands to work and their hearts to God as Mother had commanded . Later that evening the brethren and sisters visited each other in their rooms . Permission needed to be secured from the Elders and Eldresses so that each person 's whereabouts was known : no one was allowed to make an unexpected call . The brethren and sisters sat in rows facing each other . Conversation was general ; no two people were allowed to talk exclusivelytogether . Nor was anyone allowed to speak of the world : the affairs of the Society , the work of the shops , the plans for spring sowing , autumn harvest , were the only approved topics . Sister Philomena had asked permission to visit Sabra 's dormitory . She sat with the sisters facing the row of brethren . Soft voices , occasional low laughter filled the room . They are genuinely fond of one another , thought Sabra ; enforced separation has not stifled all their human feelings . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Brother on whom Philomena 's gaze was fixed . He was a handsome man of perhaps thirty , whose broad , well-made face was ruddy and glowing with health . A cheerful smile , a pleasant word or two might have been expected from such a man , but he sat silent and sober , his eyes downcast . Sabra responded to a question from the Sister beside her  --  yes , she said , she was happy enough here , she did n't mind the work  --  and then glanced again at the Brother . He was staring at Philomena ; his attractive face was clouded by melancholy . The moment passed . He looked down again , and soon the visit was over and it was time to retire . Sabra stood with the others as they clasped their hands to their chests , bowed to each other , and stepped out in single file . The Brother followed Philomena with his eyes . The next day Philomena did not appear for kitchen duty . Sister Ruthp289informed her helpers that Sister Philomena was ill and had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit her , but it was denied . One evening in the middle of the week she was returning from her time with Clara when she passed the door of the sisters ' sick-room . Usually it was closed , but now it stood open . She saw that only one bed was occupied ; in the glow of the single sperm-oil lamp , no nursing sisters were to be seen . She hesitated . It was against the rules to visit without permission , and a far worse misdeed to have a private conversation . Sister Philomena lay quiet , her eyes closed . She is sleeping , thought Sabra ; I must not disturb her . Still she lingered . From distant rooms she heard the voices of the sisters learning a new hymn for the Sabbath worship . I must go , she thought ; they will know that I did not need all this time for Clara . Still she did not move on ; and just then Sister Philomena , as if consciousthat she was being observed , turned her head and looked at the figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now of course it was too late ; she had at least to step in to say hello . As she approached the bed she saw that Philomena 's face was wet with tears , and gaunt and strained  --  whether from physical or spiritual illness it was impossible to tell . Sabra stood beside the bed , not daring to sit on the ladder-backed chair next to it . " Can I help you , Philomena ? Would you like me to call the Sister ? " Philomena shook her head , once , slowly , as if she could make no more effort than that . " Sit down , " she whispered . " I asked to see you , but they refused me . " Fighting down her fear of discovery , Sabra pulled the chair closer to the bed and cautiously perched on its edge . " Do you know my trouble ? " said Philomena , very low . " Has anyone announced it ? They said that they would tell all the Family if I did not confess . " " No  --  no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tears continued to flow , but she made no move to wipe them away . Sabra took a clean white cloth from the candle-stand and gently pressed it to Philomena 's cheeks . She felt the hot skin , she saw the fever-bright eyes behind the reddened , blinking lids . " I am to die and go to Hell , Elder James said . He said that I must root out all my feelings or I will be damned . I could die from this fever , Sabra , and if I die now I will burn forever . He promised me that . They labored with me today in the ministry . I went there , sick as I am , because they had heard bad of me , and they called me to account . " Sabra saw the face of the Brother at the union meeting . Yes  --  and Philomena had questioned her that time in the kitchen  --   | " What is it , Philomena ? Can you tell me ? " Philomena turned her head away ; she bit her lips . Under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She hardly seemed to breathe . Only her work-worn hands showed her distress : they clasped each other tightly over her bosom , as if one were trying to escape and the other holding it back . " Last summer , " she said , still with her head turned away , " we went to gather huckleberries in Groton . Brother William spoke to me . It was no more than a few words , but someone saw . " Faintly they heard the sound of many feet thudding in unison on a bare wood floor : a new dance for the Sabbath . Sabra waited for Philomenato continue ; when she did not , she said , " Is that all ? He spoke to you just that once ? " " No . He has said a word  --  only a word , only good morning or good evening  --  several times since . And I  --  I have said good morning to him . " She might have been confessing murder . She might have been a woman of the streets confessing , in her death agony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned her head to Sabra so violently that her body wrenched under the bed coverings . " Sabra ! I have watched for him ! " Her mouth twisted in an ugly way . She was trembling with fever and with the torments of her conscience , and she sobbed aloud now so that Sabra shushed her , afraid that someone would hear . " Listen to me , Philomena . Have you told this to the ministry ? " The reply was strangled , barely audible . " Yes . " " Then you have obeyed the law . You have nothing to fear . " Violently Philomena whipped her head back and forth , back and forth , as if she could drive the Devil from her soul even as the Family exorcisedhim in their dance . " No . No . They said that I must root it out of me . They will practice the warring gift on me , they said , to bring me back because I am drifting away to the world . " " And you are afraid that you can not root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes . O yes . I am afraid . Sabra  --  " She reached out and with a hot , trembling hand seized Sabra 's . " I feel that I am alive only when I see him . Nothing else matters . I live only for those moments , even if I can only catch a glimpse of him as he marches at meeting . Do you understand that ? " Sabra felt her throat tighten . She nodded because she could not speak . I have waited , too , she thought , for a word , a sign  --  I came here because I could wait no longer . And is my heart empty and subdued ? Am I longingstill to see him ? " Perhaps  --  perhaps you should go away , into the world , " she saidp291slowly . " Have you thought of that , Philomena ? " She saw the sudden terrorin Philomena 's eyes . " No . " " But others have done it . It is better than suffering so . " " No . No . We would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be saved . Even if I must burn , I can not drag him down with me . To be an apostate  --  no . " " What will you do , then ? " Philomena 's grip slackened ; she withdrew her hand . " I will confess again . I will let them war on me . I will do penance . " " And  --  " " And I will root it out of me , and he out of him . " Her eyes gazed unfocusedon the whitewashed wall . She lay quiet , her hands folded once again on her bosom . Automatically Sabra reached to straighten the slightly rumpled coverlet , for anything less than perfect order was an offense to Mother Ann watching over them from Heaven . " Good night , " she whispered . Swiftly , impulsively , she leaned down and kissed Philomena 's burning forehead ; and then , appalled at her indiscretion , she hurried out to join the dance . Christmas Day dawned bright after a heavy fall of snow . The Shaker villagelooked new-born : pure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithful . A group of brothers shoveled neat paths to the meeting house . Their cheeks reddened in the wind ; their breath came in clouds . They were joyful in their work , as they were in all their tasks . Shoveling was nothing to them . Their muscles were hardened by long hours of toil in the fields , and they made fast work of the two feet and more of snow . In each dormitory , one member read from the Book of John the parableof washing the disciples ' feet ; then all joined in , following the exampleof the Lord , and washed each other 's feet . Then they proceeded to the general meeting , where Elder Harmon read from the Scriptures the story of the Savior 's birth . The Lord 's Prayer was sung , and special Christmas prayers said , including a remembrance for the poor . As the words of the last prayer faded away , a breathless silence fell over the assembly . They knew that they were not yet done , for this was Christ 's birthday and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their rows of benches , the brethren at one end of the room , the sisters at the other . But one was absent : Sister Phebe , who had several times served as an instrument through whom those in the spirit world sent " gifts " to their earthly friends . Messages had come from the Lord , of course , and many from Mother Ann , but others communicated also : George Washington , and the old French prophets , and the prophets of the Egyptians and the Hebrews  --  Jeremiah , Ezekiel , Elijah , Deborah . Spiritual jewels were often sent , and raiment of silk and velvet ; wine and fruit , homely items such as brooms and wreaths of bright flowers . Gifts of love and humility came down , and golden chains , and trumpets , and silver swords . All of these were received through certain sisters , and so today Sister Phebe waited in the ministers ' apartment next to the meeting hall , and those without waited , too , for their Christmas gift from the world beyond . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the shape of a heart and covered with fine script . As if she were walking in her sleep , she passed unseeing into the center of the room . In a high , clear voice she began to read . " Beloved : I send you this day my best love and my choicest gifts : a basket of cakes of love , a silver chalice filled with the water of life , raiment of strength and comfort , a flock of white doves to bring you peace . " As she read , the Family listened with rapt attention . Like well-trained actors in a play , they followed the cues which Sister Phebe read to them : pantomiming , they passed around the basket and each took her or his portion of the love ; they drank from the silver chalice ; they adorned themselves with the silken shawls and golden crowns . 0 , how generous was Mother Ann ! How deeply solicitous of their welfare ! An onlooking gentile might see nothing , might mock their credulity ; but they believed , they ate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if it had been palpable in their hands . As perhaps it was . Finally Sister Phebe paused as if for dramatic effect . They understood that she had something more to tell them . They waited , all expectant ; muted excitement filled the room with an almost palpable tension . Tell us , they begged , although not a word was heard ; what is your message , Mother Ann ? " In little more than three years ' time , " said Sister Phebe , " will come a revolution . It will be a political revolution , and therefore none of your affair . But mark it well , for it will be the signal for the millennium . Far away across the sea , men will fight each other . You will hear of it , for some of the defeated will find their way to you . Welcome them , and remember what I have said . " They strained to hear , to understand . What had revolution to do with them ? The millennium ! She had promised ! Such prophecies often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks before the news arrivedfrom France , and they had heard of that wonderful new invention , the telegraph , long before anyone in the world save Morse himself had dreamed of such a thing . So now they listened to this latest revelation with perfect confidence that it would come true . Sister Phebe stood silent before them , her head bowed , her hands clasping the fine-scrawled paper . Then her rigid form swayed slightly like a sapling in a gust of wind ; her knees gave way and she coiled gracefully to the floor . Three brothers gently lifted her and carried her to the retiring room . The meeting ended with a hymn of thanks to Mother Ann , and then Elder James opened a barrel of choice apples . Each took one as the companymarched out to the dining hall for Christmas dinner . Sabra bit into the sweet , crisp flesh of the fruit ; she felt the cold air on her face , the bright landscape hurting her eyes . These things were real . The hardpackedsnow beneath her feet , the tears in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were what she knew , what she understood . She had not understoodwhat had passed in meeting ; she had prayed with the others , but she had been unable , in good conscience , to pantomime the receiving of the spiritual gifts . She had not known that such things happened in the United Society . Messages from the spirit world had not been part of the bargain . I can accept it all , she thought  --  the work , the isolation from the world , the prayers and dances and hymns ; but mesmerism  --  and the belief in spirits  --  no , that I can not . Christmas dinner was a bounteous feast . Sister Ruth and her helpers might have been accused of the sin of pride , had anyone been mean enough to carp . But all were gratefully hungry , and as each new dish appearedfrom the kitchen , it as quickly disappeared into the mouths of the faithful . They ate oyster cream soup and stuffed turkey and chestnut pudding , ginger beets and pumpkin bread and white bread and herb bread , applesauce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose hip jam , apple pie , mincemeat pie , cranberry pie , plum jelly turnovers , fruitcake and gingerbread . Afterward they knelt and gave special thanks this day , for all their blessings . That evening there were union meetings in the dormitories . Sabra came in late from her visit to Clara . As she slipped into her chair she felt the comfortable atmosphere in the room : the quiet talk , the easy chuckles , the warm and friendly interest of brothers and sisters , each for all . She saw Brother William , but Philornena , although she had been recovered some days since , was not among the sisters . But of course not : they would not be permitted to attend a union meeting together for a long time  --  months , even years . Brother William spoke easily to a Sister opposite him ; Sabra did not know her name . His face was unsmiling , but he seemed calm and self-possessed . She remembered Philomena 's torture ,  |p294her  agonized words of confession . Had Brother William undergone a similar torment ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? Words suddenly came into her mind ; she could not remember where she had read them : " He for God , and she for God in him . " But it was so . There was always that impediment . Even Shaker women , seeking God , had first to put men out of their hearts . " Welcome the stranger , " said Mother Ann , " for he will be your friend . " They obeyed her in this as in all else , and the more visitors who came to inspect them , the more they saw the wisdom of her words ; for strangers who came for a day to see how they did returned to the world with accurate information , and their reports helped to dispel the falsehoodsand slander which had dogged the early years of the experiment . Vicious reports had been circulated : tales of sexual orgies during worship , tales of the deliberate rupture of families to entice new members , tales of children kept against their will , of property confiscated , husbandsor wives deserted . Naturally people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they troubled to see for themselves , they realized that what they had heard had been in error . Their good reportshelped to counteract the bad , and so always they were made welcome , no matter how busy the season ; they were given a tour of inspection , and invited to dine , and invited , too , to purchase something  --  a packet of herbs , a palm-leaf fan , a wooden box , a jar of applesauce  --  and sent away with a cheerful wave and a kind word to tell their fellows in the world that these people were amazing clever , and not a laggard among them from what could be seen . On a mild , moist day in January , Elder James was conducting a party of three gentlemen from Worcester through the shops ; if they wished , he said , they had time before dinner to see the barn . They wanted to see it very much , they said ; they had heard much about the ingenious design of the Shaker barns , and not for anything would they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the brethren were turning legs and caning seats with practiced skill . As they made their way along the slushy path they paused on a slight rise to look about them : they saw the hog house and the blacksmith shop , the herb house and the granary and the stable , the garden shop and the medical shop , the meeting house andp295two large dwellings , the saw house and the shops where palm-leaf hats and brooms were made . They pondered the peaceful scene : how had it happened here , when all the world was mad for reform and communal experiments rose and fell , it seemed , with the ebb and flow of the tides . Perhaps they would find the answer yet before they went away ; certainly no one had tried to hide anything from them . They walked on , past the rear meadow , to the entrance to the large building of dressed stone  --  the largest by far in the village , and far bigger , of course , than any gentile barn . The interior was dim and cavernous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals . Fifty cows and several oxen stood in clean-swept stalls . In the hayloft , two young men pitched down hay in a whooshing rhythm ; two other young men scrubbed the floor from front to back along the broad center aisle . The visitors listened carefully as Elder James explained the system of trap doors in each stall through which the dirty straw was swept ; and the barn was built with entrances at two levels , he said , to facilitate getting the animals and their feed in and out . Admirable , said the gentlemen ; most ingenious and efficient . Elder James paused . Something had caught his eye . In a corner crouched a small boy . Elder James knew him ; he was Abel Thompson , an orphan from Leominster . He had lived with the Family for three years . Excusing himself , the Elder approached the child , who seemed to be murmuring to himself . " Abel . Why are you not at work ? " After one frightened glance , the boy ducked his head and withdrew farther into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the reason : a gray mother cat nestled with her litter in a bed of straw . Elder James was not an unkind man , but he was devoted to his faith . He felt his heart quicken , he felt a tension run through his body as it did whenever he discovered wrongdoing . For the moment , he forgot his tour of inspection . He thought only of this small sinner before him , and of how he must make the child understand his duty to Mother Ann . His hand shot out and grabbed the shoulder of the boy 's gray jacket . He pulled him up to his feet ; he peered at the cat . " Answer me , " he said . " Why are you not at work ? " The child hung his head ; his mouth worked as he tried to hold back his tears . " I was on my way to the shoe shop , " he said at last . " I just came in to see her for a minute . " " And how often have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Elder James searched his agile mind for words to make himselfunderstood . He felt the child tremble beneath his grip . Suddenly he crouched down so that they were face to face . He put his hands on thep296boy 's arms . " You know the rules , " he said . " If you had stopped to do some necessary errand , I would not mind your being late to the shop . But I fear that you have made a pet of this creature . " Still the child would not look at him . " Is that so , Abel ? " The boy nodded . Behind them , the kittens scrambled over each other , mewing , fighting for nourishment ; in the long rows of stalls the cattle shifted from hoof to hoof ; the gentlemen waited patiently by the door until Elder James would rejoin them . " You know that it is forbidden , " said Elder James . He allowed himself a moment 's rueful reflection : children were valuable , indeed , but they did not always repay the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train them to a trade , teach them the ways of the Society . Many of them went away when they reached adulthood . Better , perhaps , to get the necessary recruits from those grown enough to understand Mother Ann 's laws , who would not need to be reminded over and over again of the proper way to behave . Elder James straightened ; he put his hand on Abel 's neatly combed brown hair , which was cut severely all around , untapered , in the distinctiveFamily style . " Go to the shoe shop , child , and do not come here again . You must not form an attachment to any beast . We do not permit it ; it is against the law . Go on , now . " The boy said nothing , nor did he look at Elder James . He walked steadily out of the barn past the curious eyes of the visiting gentlemen . Elder James felt relieved ; once , some years ago , he had had a boy openly defy him in the matter of a dog . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to let the world wend its careless way to damnation , but he would not  --  could not  --  tolerate forbidden behaviorin his own domain . By the next day , despite the ban on unnecessary conversation , the story had gone all through the village : another child caught making a pet . It happened all the time ; there was never a child alive , it seemed , who did not have the urge to make friends with one or another of the animalpopulation . Each child had to be instructed anew that such friendship , while not as sinful as close attachment between humans , was neverthelesswrong and contrary to God 's law as interpreted by Mother Ann . Sabra saw the boy in the children 's dormitory when she went to suckle Clara . Even for a Shaker child , she thought , he seemed unusually quiet . She bent her head so that her cheek touched Clara 's dark curls . She felt the small plump body heavy in her arms . This is not my place , she thought ; I did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , several days later , she had a moment of private conversation with Philomena . She saw that her friend had put on a new atti/tude ; no longer was she the suffering , sinful woman who had sweated out her fever and her confession in the infirmary . " I have done it , " said Philomena . There was an edge to her voice : pride , thought Sabra . Pride , too , was a sin . O God  --  what was not ? " I have rooted it out , Sabra . I am free of all feeling for him . I made my confession to the ministry yesterday . Now "  --  her face fired up a little ; her voice took on a harder edge  --  " now when I grow old , when I die , I will go to the Lord with a clear conscience . I will be saved . " When I die . . . She stared at Sabra triumphantly , as if at a stranger ; and Sabra , after a moment , turned away and spoke to the Sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought , I will die too . And will I die , never having lived ? O Silas . The next day she asked for a private audience with Eldress Hannah. 15 " You must understand , " said Eldress , " that if you leave the child in our care , it is with the agreement that she will live with us until she comes of age , at which time she will herself decide whether to stay or go . " Once again they confronted each other across the table in the Family 's office ; but now , instead of November rain splattering at the windows , bright February sun shone through the sparkling panes . It seemed to Sabra a much longer time than three months since she had been in this room , speaking to the grave , kindly woman who jointly ruled this small domain . " Yes , " she said . No , she thought ; I will come to get her when I can , but you do not need to know that . " You have done very well here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came . Will you not try us for three months more before you decide ? " Eldress ' face was troubled ; she was disappointed at Sabra 's announcement , but hardly surprised . She had known from the first that this one would not remain . What she had not known was how well Sabra would fit into the Family 's routine . She was intelligent , hard-working , good-hearted  --  everyone liked her ; there had not been one bad report from any department in which she had served . And certainly the lifep298seemed to agree with her , thought Eldress : she had looked strained and peaked when she had arrived , but now she had taken on a little weight , the dark patches under her eyes had disappeared , her skin had lost its pallor . She will go back into the world , thought Eldress , and she will perhaps rejoin her husband . She shuddered . " What will you do for yourself ? " she said . " I will go back to the factory . I have an honorable discharge , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined it : the crowded city , the busy , distracting life of the gentiles . Once she , too , had been in the world , and most unhappily so , for her husband had deserted her and taken their child with him . She hardly even remembered her pain now , but once it had almost killed her . She had taken sanctuary in the Society as a novice , even as Sabra had done ; but unlike this young woman , Eldress had found her vocation here , and had been happy to stay on , sheltered from the world which had given her so much grief . She was a woman of more than usual intelligence ; the ministry had seen this , and had elevated her to her present position of authority because of it . In the world , women were nothing ; they were factory slaves or superfluous spinsters , or decorative prey to men 's sinful lust . But among Mother Ann 's chosen , women had virtually equal status . They could rise to authority alongside the brethren . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the betterbargain , but she had seen enough of life both within and without the Society to understand the strong pull of the world 's ways . Novices came and went all the time ; Sabra Blood was no exception . Like so many others , she was a " Winter Shaker , " coming in for shelter during the cold months , leaving again when the world beckoned in the green spring . Eldress struggled with herself . Try to keep her , or let her go ? Eldress ' heart was safely God 's : she seldom listened to it in temporal affairs . Why did it speak to her now in the entirely routine matter of a deflecting novice , a girl like any other ? But she was not like any other . She was different . Eldress could hardly remember a time when she had been so drawn to a fellow human being . Her own life in the world , long ago , seemed that of another woman . She was sure that she had loved her child , if not her husband , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , facing the troubled young woman seated across the table , Eldress was seized by a spasm of longdormantmaternal feeling . Let me help you , she thought ; let me protect you from the horrors of life in the world . Stay with us here , safe and sheltered . Eldress was aware that Sabra was staring at her . She felt a flush rise over her face . Had the young woman read her thoughts ? Many peoplep299were sensitives ; one did not need to be an instrument receiving messages from Mother Ann to know what one 's companions were thinking . " Of course you are at liberty to go when you wish , " she said . " But I will ask you to consider your decision one more time . " She smiled , and she was relieved to see that Sabra smiled in return . No hard feelings , then . " At least stay until sugaring-off , " she said , " and you can go with a sweet taste in your mouth . " When Sabra left the office , she stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little street of the village . The air was cold and clean , invigorating as winter air should be . She did not mind going out of doors here , because the rooms were comfortably cool : not like the stuffy , overheated atmosphere of the boarding houses and the workrooms at the factory . She felt her lungs expand as she took deep breaths . Another year or two in the mills , and she might ruin her health forever . But to stay on here was impossible . Only three months , and alreadyshe felt unbearably confined . At the opposite end of the village , she saw two brothers in a sled drivingaway from the herb house . They were going into the world to sell their wares but they would not contaminate themselves by so much as a handshake with a gentile . If they needed to separate for any reason , each would tell the other everything he had done while he was alone ; and when they returned , in two or three days , they would tell everything again to the ministry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet they could never quite escape the world . Always it was there , lying in wait outside the boundaries of the village , a threat to their chosen way . Sabra was assigned , this month , to the weaving shop . She stepped through the wooden gate between the two granite posts and began to walk toward the small building which housed the half-dozen hand looms . The village was deserted . Everyone was within doors , working . When the noon bell rang , they would all go to their dormitories for ten minutes of prayer and contemplation ; then they would proceed to the dining hall for dinner . Then back to work ; then prayer and supper ; then  --  depending on the day of the week  --  rehearsal for Sabbath service , or a union meeting . The routine was as inflexible as that of the factories  --  more , because at the factories one had an hour or two in the evenings for oneself , and all day Sunday except for church . " But you knew that when you came , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know a fact and to experience it are two very different things . " Your life here is secure . You need never worry about hunger or want again . " She passed a dwelling house , the chair shop , another dwelling  --  all painted ochre , the prescribed color  --  and then the white-painted meetingp300house . All was peaceful and attractive . A landscape artist might have made a graceful canvas from the arrangement of dark yellow buildings against the snowy landscape , all tangible offerings to God , scattered under the bright blue sky as testament to the wisdom of Mother Ann 's way . " Think again , " said the voice in her mind . " If you go , you can not come back . Here you have a life . The world has not treated you kindly . Why do you want to rush back to it ? " She reached the path to the weaving shop . From where she stood , she could hear the clacking of the looms . It was a soft and pleasant sound , unlike the fearful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main road through the village . An ancient oak tree stood at the corner by the medical shop . Her eyes had caught a flicker of movement behind the broad trunk . She hesitated . It was her duty to Eldress , she knew , to report any truant from work or school : everyone was under constant observation by everyone else . She had heard of a Shaker settlement in Ohio where the ministers had built a watchtower ; from dawn to dusk a guard was assigned like a ship 's lookout  --  not to sight a landfall , but to catch those who shirked their work or in some other way broke the order 's rules . A woman 's figure appeared from behind the tree . She looked about ; not seeing Sabra , she stepped confidently onto the path . She began to walk toward the weaving shop ; as she drew close , Sabra saw that her face was streaked with tears . Her eyes were downcast ; she walked steadilyon , her drab cloak fluttering in the breeze , her shapeless dress hanging on her body like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so encased in a shell of pitiless isolation was she that she looked like a prisoner walking to the scaffold . As she went past she was aware that someone stood watching her at the door of the shop . She glanced up . Her eyes met Sabra 's . Her expressionless face showed no recognition . She did not miss a beat of her steady stride . PhilomenaThe name hung unspoken in the air , but Sabra heard it loudly in her mind . She looked again at the broad , black trunk of the oak tree , and as she looked she saw Brother William 's figure slip from behind it . With somewhat more stealth than Philomena , he made his cautious way in the opposite direction toward the saw house . He walks like a fugitive , she thought ; like the mother and child who stole from a farmhouse one windy April night and delivered themselves up to Rachel for salvation . " I will be saved , " Philomena had said . But she had been wrong . She had not been saved . And here at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescue sinners deflected from the way to Heaven.  |p301As  Eldress Hannah had requested , Sabra stayed with the Family until the sugaring-off in early March . But before the trees were tapped , the Family celebrated Mother Ann 's birthday on March 1 . It was a festive day , a happy day second only in importance to the birthday of the Savior Himself . The next morning the brethren and several of the sisters went to the forest to drive the spikes into the maple trees and hang the hundreds of covered wooden buckets to gather the sap . Great bonfires were built to boil it down in sheet-iron kettles ; the children were brought out to get their sugar-on-snow  --  freshly boiled syrup thrown onto clean snow , and chilled at once into delicious , chewy strands of candy . Abel Thompson went with the others ; he ate his share of waxy , golden syrup , and like them he enjoyed the adventure of being out in the woods , the sense of holiday , the sweet taste filling his mouth and the smooth lumps of soft taffy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run , to play and laugh and romp off some of their animal spirits . In their wisdom , the Elders realized that you can not make a Shaker in a day , or in many days , and that discipline too harsh would only bring reaction  --  rejection , abandonment , flight to the world . So they gave the children time for freedom ; the grown-ups watched , amused , as the small figures waged their snowball battles , and built a fat man in the clearing , and spread-eagled angels in every availablespace . The sun warmed them from a cloudless sky and melted the snow which dripped from leafless branches . The sharp smell of wood fires mingled with the odor of the boiling sap . Caps and mufflers were thrown off , jackets unbuttoned . Despite the heavy snow underfoot , childrenand grown-ups alike delighted in the knowledge that spring was near , that another winter had been safely survived . Abel Thompson stood apart , watching . When another boy called to him to join in , he did not answer ; he had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabra worked with the sisters to scrub their dormitory . She had been assigned , this month , to nursery duty . The children were separated as were the adults , boys on one side of the building , girls on the other , but even so Sabra felt comforted to be working in a place so near to where Clara lived . From time to time , as she passed through the hall , she glanced into the girls ' room and saw herp302child happily pulling herself up beside a cot , or crawling around the floor under the watchful eyes of the Sister on duty . This last month , she thought , as near to her as possible ; and then I will go . She had begun to wean the child , and Clara had learned already to drink from a cup . Still Sabra worried about her ; jealously she watched as one or another Sister held Clara , or played with her , knowing that it was best for the child to love and trust these other women and yet begrudging every smile , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . As she helped the sisters care for the Family 's children , Sabra watched and listened to see how these small souls fared under the Shaker regime . All of them seemed contented , although quieter perhaps than gentile children ; certainly their little bodies were healthy enough , she thought , fed on good food , breathing the clean country air , warmly dressed against the cold , and with swift and efficient medical attention close at hand should it be needed . She remembered Elder James ' gentle hands holding Clara 's tiny form when they had brought her for help almost a year ago . In three days , Clara would be a year old . Sabra resolved to buy a presentfor her with the first wages she earned ; and I will bring it to her myself , she thought , and if they forbid it to her , I will keep it and give it to her when I can afford to take her away . She does not know the difference now ; but she will . She will . One dark morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabra went as usual with three other women to the children 's quarters to supervise their awakening . They needed help , these little ones ; they were not so quick as the adults to spring out of their warm beds , they needed to be supervised at washing , at saying their morning prayers . Sister Elizabeth , in charge of the nursery , met them at the door of the boys ' room . Her usual tranquillity had vanished ; she trembled as she spoke , and her voice came startlingly shrill . " Quickly ! " she whispered . " As quickly as you can ! Sister Caroline , to the meeting house , Sister Alice to every shop  --  look through the windows , they are all locked , but it is just light enough now to see . Sister Emmaline , to the kitchen . Sabrayes  --  goto the barn . Try to avoid the milking if you can . " They hesitated , aware of her urgency but bewildered as to its cause . " Hurry ! " she begged . Her broad face beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fear . Then she realized that she had not explained . " Abel Thompson is not in his bed , " she hissed . " He is not anywhere in the dormitory . We will all be punished for negligence if we do not find him . You know how he sometimes walks in his sleep . Even as I sleep here with them , he has got past me and into the hall before I awakened and brought him back . He can not be very far away . Now hurry ! "  |p303The  sky was gray as Sabra hastened from the building . From the kitchen she caught the scent of wood-smoke , the kitchen sisters starting up the fires for breakfast . Abel Thompson , she remembered , was the child who had made a friend of a cat . Since he had been admonished , his sleepwalking had increased . Sooner or later he would severely injure himself . She hurried down the walk and along the path toward the great barn . She saw no one ; it was still too early for the milking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barn might be a dangerous place for a sleepwalker . She dreaded finding the child injured , or dead , perhaps , fallen through a trap door or down from the hayloft  --  but she must look all the same . They must find him . She pushed open the door and stepped in . Through the high windows , the light hardly penetrated to the interior . She paused , waiting for her eyes to adjust to the near darkness . She inhaled the sweet fragrance of the hay ; she heard the clump of the animals ' hooves as they moved restlessly in their stalls , thinking that she had come to relieve them . She took a step or two down the long broad aisle . " Do not frighten him , " Sister Elizabeth had said ; and so she tried to move without sound , searching out the deeper darkness of the corners , stepping softly into the cavernous depth of the building . She could see quite well now : the rows of cattle , the doors of the stalls , the tall supporting uprights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ann had said , " Put your hands to work and your hearts to God , " and she had been right at least about the work , for her followers had had enviable prosperity . And more than anything else in the village , this great structure of stone and wood gave evidence of the Family 's success  --  more than the busy shops , the thriving industries , the rich harvests every fall . This barn was like a cathedral ; it inspired far more awe than the meeting house . Sabra moved on . She peered right and left , she looked up at the edge of the hayloft . " Abel ? " She paused to listen . " Abel , are you here ? " No answer . She took a few more steps . Her eyes picked up an image , but in the second or two before her brain registered it , she stood tentativeand confused like an intruder who has blundered upon some private ceremony . Something hung from one of the beams . Dear God . As she realized what it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the gate of a stall . She made a sound : a deep guttural expulsion of her breath . Dear God.  |p304It  was not one thing , but two . They hung side by side , so close that they seemed a single body . And even in death , Philomena 's hand clung to that of Brother William , as if , in the end , she had freely chosen the agony of eternal damnation rather than the pain of living  --  or dying  --  separate from the one whom she so helplessly , carnally loved . The light was stronger now . It showed their blackened faces , their tongues protruding from their mouths which were like splits in pieces of rotten fruit burst open with decay . " If I die now I will burn forever , " Philomena had said ; and : " I live only when I see him . " In her horror , in her great anguish , Sabra stared at the two of them , at their terrible grimaces , at their hands intertwined ; she stared against her will for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . And then a current of air turned the body of what had been a man , and he twisted at the end of the rope as if suddenly he had been given life again : as if perhaps he knew that she watched him , and he wanted to show her one thing more , a greater horror even than the fact of his corpse or his blackened face . Her eyes did move then : traveled down the length of his body . At first she did not understand what she saw . She heard the questionclearly in her mind : What is that ? And then , when she did understand  --  when she realized the meaning of the dark hole just there at the join of his legs , the blackening stains down the length of his homespun trousers , the gaping wound , the bloodencrustedknife still clenched in his hand , she felt her own body collapse , she tasted the bitter vomit retching up her throat , strangling the shriek that she had not the strength to utter . A thickening puddle of blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed the wound , and the restless animals lowing for release , and the sweet barn-smell overlaid by the stench of Death , and the mystery of these two souls who had irrevocably consignedthemselves to Hell ; and pity them , these wretched sinners , giving up their lives , burning into all eternity , and all for the sake of Mother Ann ; and pity the poor onlooker now who could never escape the sight of them , no , never again ; she would live with this vision branded forever on her brain , she would die with these two monstrous shapes like danglingrag dolls swaying back and forth before her eyes . And ah , sweet merciful Jesus , where is Thy mercy now ?  |p308March  18 , 1845 . A man emerged from the American House on Central Street . He stood on the boardwalk watching the traffic . Hustle and bustle : the American way . It had been the same in New-York and Boston . Horses and carts , wagons , closed carriages , gigs , phaetons , huge lumberingstagecoaches . Later , at closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending their pay at the shops . He had been surprised to learn that they were not paid in scrip , that the stores were not companyowned . The management was shrewd , to give them a pittance for their own . It gave them a false sense of independence . He squared his shoulders and turned to go into the saloon bar . He had a long day and night ahead of him ; he needed fortification . The barkeep served his customer stolidly , exchanging a few words and taking in his appearance in one glance and filing him away in the neatly ordered categories of his mind . An Englishman : middling height , heavybonedand muscular , a face as keen as an eagle 's , deep-set , angry eyes on either side of a hawkish nose . His skin was ruddy , high-colored like that of many English . He was from Manchester by the sound of him . The English had almost as many ways of talking as the Americans ; the barkeepwas proud of his good ear . He could place a man within fifty miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to him for five minutes . But even if this man had not said a word , the barkeep would have known that he was a foreigner . The cut of his coat , the texture of his skin , the way he carried himself  --  little things , but they told . The Englishman finished his whiskey and looked around expectantly . " Early yet , " said the barkeep . " He 'll be along . " The Englishman nodded . " Aye . That he will . " " Been here long ? " " Sin ' last night . " " Staying ? " The Englishman hesitated . He assumed that he was known to the Corporations . This lackey might well be their spy . " May happen I will . " " It 's a good place to settle , mister . Opportunity for any man who putsin an honest day 's work . What 's your trade ? " The Englishman hesitated again . " Weaver . " " That 's mostly women 's work here . But they can always use an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door opened ; a man came in . The Englishmah , having paid for hisp308drink , got up to meet him . They shook hands and went out , leaving the bartender to his speculations . He had looked closely at the newcomer 's skin , at his eyes and his teeth . He was as healthy as a prize bull . No weaver in Christendom looked in such fine condition : certainly no Englishweaver . The barkeep had heard all about the English mills and the poor slaves who worked there , for the Lowell entrepreneurs were quick to broadcast any evil news from across the water that made their own , undertaking look even marginally superior . This man could not possibly have been a factory hand  --  not for many years , at any rate . Moreover , there was never a weaver in this world who spoke so clearly , whose voice rang true , unfogged by cotton dust . Why had he lied ? The two men walked slowly up Central Street toward the Freewill Baptist Church facing them on Merrimack . " How many will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five hundred . They have heard of you , and they are anxious to meet you . " " And who will speak , besides me ? " " Brisbane , Evans , Mike Walsh  --  he 's Tammany  --  and Ryckman , I think . " The Englishman frowned . " They 're all soft-hands . I thought you said this was a workingmen 's convention . " " It is . Of course . But the gentlemen in Land Refol have interested themselves in our cause  --  " The Englishman spat violently onto the boardwalk . " They 'll be no help . I 've seen their like at home . They 're like the bloody Chartists , talkingtheir fool heads off while working folk starve . " " They are fine men , John . They speak well , they have good hearts  --  " " They 're soft . They 'll cut and run . They want Heaven on earth . TenHour'snothing to them , they wo n't fight for it . Print that in your paper and put my name to it if you like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Across the busy thoroughfare , facing them , rose the spire of the Freewill Baptist Church , whose bricks and mortar , pews and altar , had been paid for not once but twice by the donations of pious , gullible mill girls , the wily minister pocketing the surplus . John Prince had not yet heard that story ; but he would , and when he did , it would add fuel to his smoldering anger : one more swindle on the laboring classes , this one perpetrated by the handin-gloveally of the capitalists , his enemy the Church . He looked down the long stretch of Merrimack Street . His eye was caught by a pretty girl  --  a very pretty girl  --  crossing the muddy street , liftingher skirts high . " Your women are organized ? " " Some of them , yes . " " I understand one elf them testified to the legislature about Ten-Hour. "  | " Miss Bagley , yes . It was she who organized the Female Labor ReformAssociation . Several others testified also . " Prince nodded . The girl had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop . " But they did no good , " he said . " The Committee still gave an adverse report . What 's his name ? Munson ? " " Matthew Munson , yes . He  --  ah  --  was made chairman quite unexpectedly . To hear Miss Bagley 's evidence , we believe . " " Naturally . Well , she 's a brave lady . As they all are . She 's coming to-night ? " " Yes . She 's done quite well at organizing . Three hundred have joined the Female Association since January . " " Out of how many ? Twelve thousand ? Thirteen ? " " More or less . But it takes time . They are shy , some of them . They feel that it is unladylike to join an Association . And of course they fear dismissaland the blacklist . " Prince grinned . " Why , they 're quite right to do that . That 's a sensible fear . Tell her to get all thirteen thousand to join , and then let the Corporationsdismiss and blacklist . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find black-legs enough to run their hell-holes then . " His eyes narrowed . The girl had come out of the dry-goods store carrying a small package . She crossed Merrimack Street and walked down the opposite side of Central . " They 're a hard case , the women , " he said . " A hard , hard case . But let them come . We 'll find some way to use them . " He grinned . " I 'll see to that . " Sabra sat alone in the stuffy boarding-house bedroom . She had walked out in the morning , and had eaten her dinner with the girls , and now she was left with the afternoon to fill . Three more days before she could begin , the overseer at the Appleton Corporation had said . He had looked carefully at her discharge slip from the Commonwealth . It seemed in order . He had caught three forgeries in the last month , girls desperate for work . When he had checked the blacklist he had found their names , sure enough ; he knew a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going at the end of the week , he said . Mrs. Pye , at Number Three Jackson Street , would have a place to board . The cap which she had bought that morning for Clara was white , trimmed in lace , with narrow satin ribbon ties . She pictured it framingClara 's chubby , rosy face . Her heart constricted . Clara . She longed to see her . She had been gone only a day . It seemed a week . How could she bear to live apart from her ? The baby would not miss her , Eldress Han-1 nah had said . She would receive plenty of love and attention from the sisters ; she would thrive . Sabra had had to admit the truth of it : in the absence of her mother , Clara loved everybody who loved her . In fact , thought Sabra bitterly , it might be best not to visit her at all . Every partingwould be painful for them both ; best stay away , and let her grow in peace until she had saved enough  --  No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five ?  --  Clara would have forgotten her completely . Better for them both to bear the pain than not have her own daughter know her . Visiting would be expensive . A dollar to hire a gig  --  more if she had a boy to drive . She would drive herself . But only once a month . Her pay would be three dollars and ten cents a week , less one dollar thirty-seven and a half cents board . One seventy-two and a half to save . If she spent not a penny  --  but she must . She badly needed shoes , and a summer dress . Her old one was worn out , hardly fit for the weaving room although it would have to do . And a new bonnet , the plainest to be found , surely , but still she needed one . She could not step out of doors bare-headed , or , worse , in the little Shaker cap , and her old bonnet had been ruined by the snowstorm on the day she left Mrs. Clapham 's . She would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace it . Clara 's cap seemed so tiny . Carefully Sabra wrapped it in its brown paper and tied the little package and laid it in her hand trunk . Sunday : two days more . She would go to celebrate Clara 's first birthday . Until then she needed to fill up the time . She forced her thoughts away from the Family at Harvard Village . Go , Eldress Hannah had said , her eyes wide with alarm at the sight of Sabra 's condition ; yes , you were right , I should have let you go before . It is my fault that you have suffered this  --  this dreadful discovery . She shuddered now , reliving it . She pressed her hands against her eyelidsas if she would press away the vision which still burned behind them , bright in the darkness : two corpses , damned for eternity , swaying at the end of their separate ropes . Dear God : help me to forget . She opened her eyes ; she looked out the bedroom window . Across the street she saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery hummedhrough the boarding house . I should rest , she thought . Soon enough I will be glad of a free day . A newspaper lay folded on top of a bureau . She picked it up . It wasp311the Tri-Weekly Advertiser  --  the Democratic competition to the Whig Courier , Munson 's paper . Biddy . Blue eyes in a pale thin face framed by a fall of heavy black hair . And before that : the wretched bundle of rags huddled on the boarding-house steps . She , Sabra , had saved that child : she was , in a way , responsible for her as she was for Clara . ( But you discharged that responsibility , said her conscience ; you gave her the means to make her own way . Still . ) She put Biddy out of her mind and glanced at the newspaper . The Hutchinson Family Singers at the First Freewill Baptist Church ; Santa Anna " in durance " in Mexico ; Dr. Gladwin , Surgeon Dentist ; Thomas Wilson Dorr imprisoned in Rhode Island in his fight for universal manhoodsuffrage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " glorious reform " of the present system . On the third page , a tiny four-line announcement at the bottom right corner : an announcement of a " festival " at Wentworth 's new hall that evening in aid of the Female Labor Reform Association . More trouble , she thought . She wanted none of it . Biddy . And Patrick . She had passed Codwell 's store that morning . Probably Patrick owned the place now . She did not want to see him ; she did not want to see Mrs. Clapham or any of the girls whom she had known at the Commonwealth . She wanted no reminders of the past . But Biddy was different . Like a daughter , almost , or like the sister whom Sabra had never had . In June she herself would be twenty-three . Biddy had never been sure of her age , but she was probably about eighteennow . Sabra was suddenly , overwhelmingly curious to know how Biddy was . Had she stayed at Munson 's ? Was she content ? Was she to marry Patrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could easily walk to Munson 's house on Pawtucket Street and back before the meal was served . She would not stay long . Just a few moments , a brief chat ; it would not be a busy time of day for a servant , they might spare her ten or twenty minutes . She got up , took her cloak and her ruined bonnet from the peg and went downstairs . The wind had changed . The air was colder now , raw , the sky overcast . She pulled her cloak tight around her as she walked , for the second time that day , down Central Street toward Merrimack . As she passed Codwell'sshe paused and looked in . She saw a clerk : not Patrick . She walked on . At the corner of Merrimack stood two young women distributing handbills . She took one . It announced the meeting which she had seen advertised in the newspaper . Nothing for her . She walked on down MerrimackStreet , noting the familiar shops : Wyman and Wilson 's Dry Goods , B. F. Watson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some , which she remembered , were gone : Hutchinson 's Musical Instru/ments , Dyer 's Looking Glass &; Picture Frames . She looked away , down to the boardwalk under her feet . She would have nothing to do with shops . She came to the depot , crossed Dutton Street , came to the MerrimackHouse Hotel on the corner . If she turned her head and looked down Dutton Street to her right she would see the Commonwealth boarding houses , the huge red-brick bulk of the mill at the end of the canal blocking off the view of the river . She did not look ; she went on . She crossed Worthen Street . To her left lay the Paddy Camp Lands : the Acre . A gang of ragged , shouting boys raced past her and turned the corner into the maze of alleys and narrow streets . As she looked after them she saw a rat flash across the alley behind them . She shuddered . At least she had saved Biddy from that , she thought ; she might be a servant but at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ended . Her shoes and the hem of her dress were becoming covered with mud . I should not have come , she thought . What will I do if I say Hello Biddy bow have you been all this time , and she looks at me and does n't know me ? She realized that she was standing still : an odd thing to do , in a town where everyone was so busy . A woman stared at her from the window of a house . Probably she wonders if I 'm coming to beg , thought Sabra . No : I do n't look Irish . She thinks I 'm distributing tracts . She walked on . How could Biddy not remember ? If she is there she will be glad to see me . And I her . She will not pester me with questions . She will kiss me and listen to whatever I tell her and ask for nothing more . To her , I am someone to be admired and  --  yes  --  loved . The thought was comforting ; she longed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by watchful sisters . She had never seen Matthew Munson 's house on Pawtucket Street , althoughshe remembered Biddy 's description of it and she knew its approximatelocation . When she came to the Corporation Hospital she turned left and walked down Pawtucket Street parallel to the river . Betweenthe spacious frame houses to her right she could see the opposite shore . The northern shore : beyond it was New Hampshire . She had come from there ; she had traveled down this very street in the peddler 's wagon . And if some kindly gypsy fortune teller had told her then what would become of her she would not have believed . When she reached the house  --  she was sure that it was the right house , gaudy and yellow  --  she paused for a moment , undecided . Front door or back ? Surely back . She pushed open the gate . A path led through the garden to the rear of the house . She followed it . A stern-faced , middle-aged woman answered her knock . " Excuse me . I am looking for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The woman looked her over . " No . " She started to close the door.  | " Please  --  do you know where I can find her ? I am a friend , I have been away and I have n't seen her for some time . " " She 's gone , " said the woman . " Been gone for a year and more . " " Do you know where she is ? " The woman hesitated . " Dracut , " she said at last . " Is she  --  do you know where I could send her a letter , perhaps ? Is she in service ? " The woman 's mouth tightened . " You might call it that . But if you 're a decent , God-fearing woman you wo n't go looking for her . " Again she tried to shut the door , but Sabra 's need to know had made her bold and she put her hand against the frame and her foot on the sill . " I do n't understand . Is she all right ? Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face filled with that implacable contempt reserved to the self-righteous . " Her ? Not likely . We think of her as dead and gone , and if you were a friend of hers I 'd advise you to do the same . " With a sudden push she slammed the door , narrowly missing Sabra 's hand . Sabra stood on the back porch , trying to make sense of what she had been told . Dead and gone ? But only to be thought of so ; not actually in the ground . Disappointment weighted down her heart . I did not want to bother him , she thought , but now I must . He will know ; he knows everything . Codwell 's West India Goods store was seldom busy in the late afternoon ; when Sabra entered she was alone save for the clerk behind the counter . " Is Patrick O'Haran here ? " He nodded ; without a word to her he poked his head into the back room . " Patl Someone t ' see you . " Sabra felt a little thrill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Patrick step out into the front of the store . How manly he was ! He had let his hair grow longer ; he had filled out , become slightly taller . He looked tired , but his features had settled into a firm , hard , adult face : a face to trust , to respect . He was about twenty years old now , she calculated , but he seemed much older.
