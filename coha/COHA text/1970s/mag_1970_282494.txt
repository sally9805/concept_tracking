" It is not possible to spend any prolonged period visiting public school classrooms without being appalled by the mutilation visible everywhere-mutilation of spontaneity , of joy in learning , of sense of self . Because adults take the schools so much for granted , they fail to appreciate what grim , joyless places most American schools are . . . what contempt they unconsciously display for children . " <P> Such a jeremiad is not the conclusion of a radical school reformer but of a concerned FORTUNE editor who visited more than 100 schools during a 3-year , $300,000 study sponsored by the Carnegie Corporation . Charles Silberman , 45 , is the author of a perceptive summary of race relations , Crisis in Black and White . His new book , Crisis in the Classroom ( Random House ; $10 ) , is likely to be as widely discussed as James B. Conant 's 1959 report , The American High School Today . Silberman finds that even highly reputed schools are so preoccupied with order and discipline that they neglect real education . <P> No Questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " reports Silberman , promotional brochures describe the central-core library as the school 's " nerve center . " Yet during the school 's first year of operation , children were allowed to go there only once a week , and then not to read but to practice taking books from the shelves and returning them . The second year they were not permitted to go at all because the part. - time librarian had returned to teaching spelling . Prejudice compounds primness , says Silberman . In one fifth-grade classroom , a black youngster raised his hand to ask a question . The principal , visiting for the day , snapped , " Put your dirty hand down and stop bothering the teacher with questions . " <P> Equally depressing , writes Silberman , most of the reforms suggested by academics touting new courses and computers have left " the schools themselves largely unchanged " - chiefly because their proponents fall into the same trap that hobbles school staffs . " It simply never occurs to more than a handful to ask why they are doing what they are doing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is mindlessness-a failure to think seriously about purposes or consequences . " <P> Baking Cakes . Silberman 's ideal of what schools should be doing is hard to fault : he is convinced that they can help " create and maintain a humane society " by making their first priority the production of " sensitive , autonomous , thinking , humane individuals . " In a glowing chapter , he reports that his ideal is already close to reality in about half the primary schools in England , where orthodoxy is giving way to highly informal " open " classrooms . At first glance , they look like chaotic kindergartens : children move around talking ; rows of desks are replaced by " workshop areas " arranged throughout the room and in nearby corridors .
