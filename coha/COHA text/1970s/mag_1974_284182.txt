The mustache and trademark eyebrows are snow white , and Wayne Morse looks his 73 years . But he refuses to act the senior citizen . At a Memorial Day picnic , Oregonians , who call him the Old Tiger , watched him sprint across the grass after a sign that had been blown from a tree . Next day Democrats showed confidence in his wind by nominating him for his old seat in the U.S. Senate . <P> Morse has been a long time in coming back from his 1968 defeat-an attempt two years ago failed-but this time he might just make it . His victory in last week 's primary over State Senate President Jason Boe , 45 , and two other candidates was a shrewdly wrought upset . Boe is a popular liberal with whom Morse has no policy quarrel . So Morse focused on his own record during his long ( 1944-68 ) , colorful Senate career . He constantly reminded voters that he was an enemy of excessive presidential power long before President Nixon unintentionally made that a popular issue . At every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foes even in the days when they were both Republicans. * " If I 'm sent back to the Senate , " he promised , " I 'm going to pick up where I left off , and that 's the worst news for President Nixon that anyone could send to him . " <P> While Boe ran a vigorous and highly visible fight that took him to each part of the state three times , Morse did little more than nudge the populace with a carefully paced effort . He appeared mostly before little groups of people in the state 's many small communities . His press interviews were generally limited to local television and radio stations and weekly newspapers . His only major speech was at the commencement exercises at the University of Oregon School of Law , where he once was dean for 13 years . <P> The understated effort was enough for Oregon 's unpredictable voters , who appeared to be in a particularly ornery mood this spring . In a state known for its enthusiastic acceptance of progressive politics , the primary produced a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feeling of distrust and antipathy toward government-attitudes he has long expressed . He won 153,176 votes , compared with Boe 's 123,393 . ( Two minor candidates together polled fewer than 36,000 . ) <P> In the Democratic gubernatorial primary , former State Treasurer Bob Straub , 54 , unexpectedly nosed out both liberal State Senator Betty Roberts and Incumbent Treasurer James Redden , who had broad support from organized labor and the press . On the Republican side , voters rejected Clay Myers , the secretary of state whom Governor Tom McCall had strongly backed to succeed him . Instead , they chose conservative State Senator Victor Atiyeh . Finally , voters of both parties joined to defeat five of six statewide ballot measures , including a bond issue for water projects , proposals to use some gasoline-tax funds for mass transit , and a school-tax measure that would have shifted some of the burden from property taxes to income and corporate levies .
