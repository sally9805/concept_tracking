As Secretary of State Henry Kissinger flew to New Delhi last week , reporters accompanying him noticed that he seemed uncharacteristically subdued . Perhaps he was preoccupied with weighty matters involving Moscow and the Middle East . On the other hand , he may only have been a bit apprehensive about seeing India 's proud , mercurial Prime Minister , Indira Gandhi . Their last meeting , which coincided with the start of a U.S. " tilt " toward Pakistan during the Bangladesh crisis of 1971 , ended in mutual distrust . Mrs. Gandhi has since been known to turn livid at the very mention of Kissinger 's name . Prospects for a successful encounter seemed dim after India 's National Herald , on the day of Kissinger 's arrival , published an interview with Mrs. Gandhi in which she complained that Americans regard India " as marginal to their global strategy . " <P> Arms Control . Despite that inauspicious sign , the Secretary of State was greeted by Mrs. Gandhi with civility if not warmth . By the end of his visit , it seemed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task . Unleashing some romantic metaphors , Kissinger told reporters that the stormy " teenage period " of Indo-American affairs had now matured into the stability of an adult relationship . <P> The talk in New Delhi was of arms control and trade concessions . India refused to sign the 1968 Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons on the ground that it discriminated against nuclear have-not nations . Since the May 18 blast that signaled India 's emergence as the world 's sixth nuclear power , Kissinger has expressed concern over what he calls " the export of explosive technology . " He worried that India might share its nuclear expertise with politically volatile Arab countries in exchange for much-needed oil concessions . <P> When he left New Delhi last Wednesday , Kissinger felt confident that India would accept U.N.-sponsored restraints on nuclear technology . In order to secure Indian cooperation on this issue , Kissinger assured Mrs. Gandhi that the U.S. would continue its arms embargo against Pakistan . But he purchased a warm leave-taking in New Delhi at the risk of a cool reception one day later in Islamabad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to India . Mrs. Gandhi refuses to acknowledge publicly that thousands of people have died of starvation in the states of Bihar and West Bengal ( see SPECIAL SECTION ) . The Prime Minister , having proudly proclaimed her country 's self-sufficiency after a record harvest in 1971 , was reluctant to accept any aid that made India seem to be on the American dole again . <P> Kissinger nevertheless negotiated an agreement that will provide India with between 500,000 and 1 million tons of inexpensively priced wheat on a long-term deferred-payment plan . The bilateral good will was further enhanced when Kissinger publicly labeled the U.S. 's attitude during the cold war of distrust toward uncommitted nations like India as " anachronistic and self-defeating . " By accepting India 's neutrality between East and West as " an altogether understandable and practical " position , Kissinger laid to rest a grudge that New Delhi has borne toward Washington since former Secretary of State John Foster Dulles used to denounce India 's foreign policy as " immoral .
