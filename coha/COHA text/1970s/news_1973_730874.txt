txt Phase 4 ought to work better than the current freeze , or Phase 3A , as it was dubbed . But the announcement of the latest chapter in the reluctant drama of Mr. Nixon and his incomes policy illustrates the learn-as-you-go nature of U.S. economic controls , as well as the ambivalent attitude the administration still , takes toward them . Just five weeks ago , in announcing the price freeze , the President recognized the hardship that rising food prices place on the family budget . But in five weeks he or his economic team have learned something else : " The evidence is becoming overwhelming , " he said , " that only if a rise of food prices is permitted now can we avoid shortages and still higher prices later . " The ambivalence of their approach must be read between the lines . Phase 4 will be tough , in some ways tougher on business than Phase 2 , which was in effect for all of 1972 . End promised ? sometime But hope is held out that all controls will end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed his sympathy for the recommendation of the Labor-Management Advisory Committee that they be phased out by the end of this year . Surely anyone can live with toughness if he thinks it will be only temporary , and many business decisions can be postponed , as the freeze this summer has shown . The ambivalence also shows in the administration 's hope that the economy will cool off anyhow , that the Federal Reserve Board will turn the screws again and that budgetary actions this fiscal year will be on the deflationary side . This is not an administration which ever wanted to tinker with the details of the American economy . It felt itself forced into the controls program when an inflationary psychology inherited from the height of the Vietnam war and its deficit financing simply would not die . But Treasury officials and Council of Economic Advisers members have been ? almost without exception ? skeptical of getting enmeshed in the details of the American pricing system . The apparent success of the first freeze and of Phase 2 were due mostly to the slack that existed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touting of the success reinforced the public 's belief that controls can work . // *A reluctant ' Phase 4 // Phase 3 was initiated , as one Treasury official explains , because the administration was on notice from both business and labor late in the fall of 1972 that the tight rules of Phase 2 were about to cause serious problems . In tightly controlling corporate profits under Phase 4 , the administration will hold back plans for economic growth which are in the long run , the only thing that can hold down prices . By holding out the hope that Phase 4 will be of short duration , the administration helps business postpone decisions . Thus , whatever the results of Phase 4 will appear to be , they will be distortions to some extent . There is little evidence that controls can be made to work for long , if this is to remain essentially a free , or market-oriented economy . There is certainly little evidence that the administration expects them to be around for long , as long as enforcement is left largely to 1,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What disturbs many career economists , including some in government , is that in Its dislike for controls in general the administration is not thinking through the specific steps that may have some positive results . Taking food as one example , there is a divergence today between theneed to keep food prices down at home and to sell food abroad to help the U.S. balance of payments . Both goals are important ones . Yet placing short-term export controls on certain foodstuffs was shock treatment to purchasers abroad , was not the kind of action that gives any confidence in this country as a longterm source of those products , and worked against the balance of payments . Food subsidy possible Perhaps the time has come to consider a kind of subsidy somewhere in the food production chain which will allow farmers to sell all they can produce , including to purchasers abroad , allow wholesalers and retailers to make their profit , and still hold down the cost of food for the average household . The administration appears humbled over its economic management to date . It should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration would have done it better . What Mr. Nixon and his economic advisers need to do , though , is to prove that their dislike for controls has not blinded them to specific types of actions ( for instance , the highly successful Construction Industry Stabilization Committee helped get a grip on construction wages ) that could be highly effective .
