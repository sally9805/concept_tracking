WORD PLAY : <P> <P> What Happens When People Talk <P> by PETER FARB 350 pages . Knopf. $8.95 . <P> <P> By manipulating its throat while it growled , Alexander Graham Bell once tried to teach a dog to say " How are you , Grandma ? " In the latter half of the 20th century , Homo loquens ( man the talker ) has been rediscovered to be a wonder beside which Bell 's talking dog would rate only as a very minor marvel - even if Rover had recited the whole Gettysburg Address to Grandma . The infinitely subtle strategies of man speaking to man , the remarkable social utility of a given language shaped to a given culture-these and other matters have become the subject for celebration and analysis by the new science of structural linguistics . <P> The latest knowledge of tongues - an interdiscipline involving psychology , sociology and even a touch of metaphysics-is summed up here for the layman by Peter Farb , who as a sometime lecturer hi English at Yale and a sometime authority on American Indians ( Man 's Rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . A portion of what Farb says has been said by the old semanticists and , in fact , by such commentators on the vagary of words as Lewis Carroll . Farb 's achievement is to organize today 's theories into a primer , systematically discounting or rejecting outworn conceptions and myths which he feels may be lodged in the minds of his readers : <P> Myth No. 1 : A foreign language is just a different code for the same message . Wrong , Farb and the new linguistics scholars say . Each speech community expresses its sense of what is important , what is " right " and " wrong , " through its language . The Koyas of India , Farb notes , have no separate words to distinguish dew , dog and snow , which may astonish a visiting anthropologist . But then they can name seven kinds of bamboo , for which visiting anthropologists will have no translation . Thus each language edits the universe . <P> Myth No. 2 : Words more or less say what everybody who uses them thinks they say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It can be racist or sexist ( " mankind " standing for the human race ) . But it is hardly ever neutral . Language is a game people play , perhaps the trickiest as well as the most ingenious . In the Mandarin dialect of Chinese-the second most popular language in the world-ma can mean hemp , scold , mother or horse , depending upon whether the speaker 's voice rises , falls , remains level or merely dips . But the nuances of technique in language are nothing compared with its social and moral nuances . <P> Myth No. 3 : Children learn to talk because they are conditioned to do so by social pressures , beginning with anxious parents . This theory has been endorsed by the B.F. Skinner school of behaviorists . Farb prefers the explanation of M.I.T. 's celebrated expert on linguistics , Noam Chomsky . A child learns to talk as he learns to walk-so in essence goes the Chomsky argument . He is born with a kind of blueprint for language that he puts into practice inexplicably , or miraculously , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was nearly three. )
