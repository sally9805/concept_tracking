It was an appropriately bizarre way to begin the final phase of Watergate . After the opening statements , Federal Judge John J. Sirica 's Washington courtroom was eerily silent for up to 100 minutes at a time . Muff-sized earphones clamped on their heads , judge , jury , defendants and spectators alike were transported by tape recording into former President Richard Nixon 's Oval Office . They heard Nixon curse and connive with his top aides to conceal the truth of Watergate from all others , including his own Justice Department . Reproduced publicly for the first tune , the ghostly voices , disembodied but all too real , conveyed the intent to deceive with far more impact than any previously printed transcripts . <P> The five defendants , accused of having joined in that secret conspiracy , have now abandoned any pretense of a common front . H.R. Haldeman , Nixon 's former chief of staff , swiveled around to turn his back on the jury and grinned as he heard his own high-pitched laughter played back in a rare moment of taped levity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through one earphone , as if he wanted to hear as little as possible . The others , John Ehrlichman , Robert Mardian and Kenneth Parkinson , were somber . <P> At one point , a fleeting smile enlivened the face of a woman juror . Titters rippled through the courtroom when Charles Colson , an imprisoned former Nixon aide , was heard telling Convicted Watergate Burglar E. Howard Hunt not to get too specific about why he wanted hush money . " This is a serious matter , " the stern Sirica scolded . " Serious to the defendants ... serious to me . There will be no more laughter . " <P> Indeed , the opening weeks ' testimony in the Watergate conspiracy trial carried grave judicial implications for the defendants , and portended adverse historical consequences for Nixon . As outlined in the clear , confident opening argument of Assistant Special Prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste , in the familiar , matter-of-fact testimony of Perpetual Watergate Witness John Dean and in the devastating tapes , the Government 's case was impressive indeed . <P> Ben-Veniste wasted no time in grappling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nixon , who was not in court and is safe from prosecution because of his pardon . The prosecutor , in effect , pronounced Nixon guilty , contending that the conspiracy to obstruct justice had " involved the participation of even the President himself . " <P> Misled and Lied . Nixon was also condemned by Ehrlichman 's attorney , William Prates , as one who had " deceived , misled and lied . " With three of the defendants turning against each other , and two assailing Nixon , the basic details of Nixon 's role seem certain to emerge-just as predicted by the retiring Special Prosecutor , Leon Jaworski ( see box following page ) . <P> Although there were no major new disclosures-indeed , few are expected in the trial-some fresh links in the chain of evidence supporting the conspiracy charge were forged :
