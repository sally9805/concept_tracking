PROPOSALS for Government funding of an American supersonic transport date back ten years-the same amount of time Senator William Proxmire has spent opposing it . From 1961 to 1969 , Proxmire engaged in five losing campaigns against SST appropriations . He has filibustered and conducted hearings , hammering away in a personal crusade against the " perfectly trivial purpose of developing an SST , seeing how rapidly we can already fly people overseas . " It was the kind of tenacity that has made Proxmire the bane of defense contractors , pork-barreling colleagues and consumer frauds . <P> He is a loner and a maverick who disdains the Senate " club " way of conducting business , and as a result , his effectiveness as a legislator has been uneven . Proxmire came to the Senate in 1957 after winning a special election to fill the seat vacated by Joseph McCarthy 's death . His committee assignments included Banking and Currency , Post Office and Civil Service , which he used to help shape his reputation as one of the chief watchdogs of Government waste . <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he attacked Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson for his autocratic rule of the Senate . Proxmire 's popularity with insiders was further eroded by his penchant for paring fat Government work projects dear to the Senate 's patronage heart . <P> Until the late ' 60s he was considered a scattershot Senator , but during the past several years , he has homed in on some major issues . In 1967 he pushed a truth-in-lending bill through the Senate that had languished for four terms . He uncovered the $2 billion cost overrun on the C-5A and defense contractors ' hiring of former high-ranking military officers . Finally , he is close to success in his fight against the SST . <P> <P> His staff was treated to clear evidence of his delight with the House defeat of funds for the big plane : from inside his suite in the New Senate Office Building could be heard the voice of the usually taciturn Proxmire singing Bill from the old musical Show Boat . His office reflects his personal style-sparsely furnished , its green walls completely devoid of pictures or decorations . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breakfast at the office after his 4.8-mile run-not a jog-to the office and 200 pushups . At 55 , Proxmire is nearly as fit as he was as an undergraduate boxer and football player at Yale . <P> As the SST fight goes down to its final stage , Proxmire 's groundwork is largely done . Testimony of economists and environmentalists is already in , and the body of information he has developed against the plane over the years is well known to his colleagues . He does not wring votes from fellow Senators with deals and high-pressure promises , as members of the club would do , but he relishes the upcoming battle for the final handful of votes : " It 's going to be a goddam interesting week .
