If votes were cast with feet and tallies read off odometers , the West would win the U.S. popularity contest in a landslide . The 1970 census figures show that the population of mountain and Pacific states has increased by 24.1 % since 1960. v. an increase on the other side of the Great Divide of only 11% . Horace Greeley 's advice , " Go West , young man , " is still being heeded by young and old alike , in spite of the fact that the " frontier " is now posted at intervals with taco and fried-chicken stands . Ecologists point out that the very nature of the West-little water and enormous stretches of arid soil-makes it impossible to support the continued migration . Legislators , scientists and citizens are now openly concerned about the threat of " Californication " - the haphazard , mindless development that has already gobbled up most of Southern California .

The city 's future and that of much of the rest of the once-wild West is written large upon a developer 's billboard dead ahead : TOMORROW FOR SALE , 36 MILES . <P> THEN TURN LEFT . <P> <P> Even those still separated from their nearest neighbor by hectares of sage and pine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice thinking small and muster the strength to resist or redirect the inevitable population growth . The old cowboys ' plaint , " Do n't fence me in , " is fast giving way to the environmentalists ' plea , " Please fence them out . " Conservation groups fantasy building one-way overpasses straight through to Canada to keep Californians out of Oregon , or constructing an adobe wall around New Mexico to keep the Texans from straying in , and worse , staying . <P> The concern over Californication has led to a reverse sell . After decades of come-hither promotion . Westerners are beginning to unsell their own states .
