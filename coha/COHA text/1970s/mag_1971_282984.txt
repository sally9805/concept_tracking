The powder mill that Eleuthere Irene du Pont de Nemours built in 1802 on the banks of Delaware 's Brandywine River has exploded into a vast corporation that did $3.6 billion worth of business last year , and now ranks 18th on FORTUNE 'S roster of the largest U.S. industrial companies . Du Font 's base remains in tiny Delaware , 47th in population among the states . That disparity in size intrigued Economist Lewis Anthony Dexter , who studied the situation in 1963 and concluded : " The elephant takes care not to dance among the chickens . " It also intrigued Ralph Nader , who feels otherwise . In a report released last week , a group of his Raiders argued that the elephant not only dances with the chickens ; it tramples them into the ground . <P> In the 845-page report , titled The Company State , Nader writes : " Du Pont dominates Delaware as does no single company elsewhere in any other state . Virtually every major aspect of Delaware life is pervasively and decisively affected by the Du Pont company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irene du Pont Jr. , 51 , a company vice president and de facto family spokesman , told TIME Correspondent Hays Gorey that the charges are nonsense . Du Pont approves a description of the report by Dr. Julian Hill , a retired Du Pont chemist , as " intellectual vandalism . " He adds : " I do n't believe there is Du Pont family control of Delaware . " <P> Uses of Power . Many of the facts of Du Font 's size and reach are beyond dispute . The company employs 13% of the Delaware work force ; its $288 million payroll in Delaware is bigger than the state budget . The family controls two of the state 's four largest banks . Irene Jr. , for example , is president of the family-controlled Christiana Securities holding company , a director of the Wilmington Trust Co. , the News-Journal Co. , Delmarva Power &; Light and chairman of the Greater Wilmington Development Council . The state 's sole U.S. Representative is Pierre S. du Pont IV , a freshman Republican . Governor Russell Peterson is a former Du @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and associates make up 25% of the state legislature . <P> The Nader report pries at every chink in the uses of the Du Fonts ' corporate and family power . Among the Raiders ' charges-and Du Font 's rebuttals : <P> TAXES . Former Senator John Williams , denouncer of Bobby Baker for influence peddling , sponsored a tax-bill amendment that allowed a $2.1 million writeoff for Xanadu , a family estate in Cuba that was confiscated by Castro . Further , say the Raiders , the company and family properties in Delaware are undervalued for tax purposes . Irene Jr . says that he knows nothing about any contacts made with Senator Williams in the family 's behalf . To the other point , Vice President Irving Shapiro , the company 's first Jewish director , replies : " If the accusation is that Du Pont is chiseling on existing tax laws , that 's absurd . If the criticism is that tax laws should be changed , that may be needed . "                @ @ @ @ @
