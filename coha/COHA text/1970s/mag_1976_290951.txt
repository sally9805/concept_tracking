Armed with shotguns , Magnums , carbines and clubs , teams of men sweep the streets , enforcing a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew for everyone under 18 . Citizens cower behind the barricaded doors of their own homes , listening to the shots and shouts that punctuate the night air . The city is not Beirut or Belfast but Detroit , whose agonies are every bit as real and whose conflicts seem equally impossible to eradicate . <P> After weeks of gang terrorism that included killings , a near riot , robberies , pillaging and rape , Detroit 's black mayor , Coleman Young , belatedly rushed back from vacation and vowed last week , " We will not tolerate lawlessness in the streets . We will stand for it no longer . " Detroit 's police needed no further encouragement . Minutes after the curfew went into effect , plainclothesmen and uniformed cops were out in force , and anything that moved was fair game . At one point , a two-man team sighted three black youths on a dark street corner . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his partner covered the trio with a lethal-looking 12-gauge shotgun . " We were just coming home from skating , man , " said one youth . " You 're skating , " barked the cop , " right to jail . " And off they went . <P> Mere Rhetoric . Still , the malaise that grips the decaying motor capital is unlikely to yield to short-term measures like a curfew-and even less to mere rhetoric and good intentions . As John Cardinal Dearden , the Archbishop of Detroit , put it last week , " We are called upon to rebuild the structure . " <P> The problems that plague Detroit ( pop . 1.4 million ) differ only in magnitude from those that afflict other large cities in the U.S. : an eroding tax base as affluent whites abandon the core city ; reduced services , including police protection ; widespread unemployment , particularly among black youths ; neighborhoods where housing and other buildings have been allowed to deteriorate ; and low-quality schools . Perhaps more debilitating than any of these is a growing feeling that nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resorted to near martial law after roving gangs of young toughs with names like the Black Killers , the Errol Flynns , the Sheridan Strips and the Bishops virtually took over the streets of the city 's scrubby east side . Perhaps as many as 500 of the gang members are concentrated in the impoverished Fifth Precinct , a 6-sq. - mi. moonscape of abandoned storefronts , crumbling homes and schools , littered streets and sidewalks . Once a quiet white community , the precinct is nearly all black , its various sections divided into territories controlled by one or another of the gangs .
