Six years ago the grand old man of American sculpture , Alexander Calder , was commissioned by Grand Rapids , Michigan , to do a giant stabile in the new city plaza . It sits there now like a great crimson plant . And the people love it . Vice-President Gerald Ford said , " I did n't care for it .11 first , but now I would n't be without it . " That 's how a lot of people felt at first . New art offers a challenge . Most people accept it . Than they find themselves liking it . Like the story they tell in Grand Rapids now . Two waitresses in the Finial Restaurant high in the Union Bank Building were looking down at the Calder , surrounded by new sculpture  --  part of a temporary exhibit called " Art Off the Pedestal . " " I do n't like that new stuff , " said one . " It 's really crazy , " said the other , adding after a moment 's thought : " It 's an insult to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll feel about that sculpture as they now do about their Calder . What ties these stories together ? Not just Grand Rapids , but a federal government agency , the National Endowment for the Arts , which funded both the Calder and the new show , just as it quietly puts millions of dollars every year to bringing art to the people  --  in public squares and on city walls . And people to the art  --  in theaters and symphony halls all across America . When I became Chairman of the National Endowment , President Nixon mentioned his dream to have everyone , especially the young , share in the country 's vast artistic resources . Since 1969 , with the leadership of the President and the strong bipartisan support of the Congress we have been able to make the National Endowment really national . And we have done so by using federal dollars to increase private and other governmental monies . There is Endowment-supported sculpture in public buildings and squares all across America ; walls of inner cities have been transformed by splashes of gay and sometimes angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; artists do posters , sets and costumes for some of America 's best dance and theater companies , themselves supported by other Endowment programs ; a famous art train steams into areas hungry for visual culture ; artists of every kind work directly with school children in all the states ; and artists receive unprecedented support from fellowships to continue to add to the future 's heritage . The Arts Endowment , as insiders call it , is often present when you go to craft fairs or to a theater. a symphony or a ballet  --  or maybe read a book of poems or see an avant-garde film . Look for that little line " Supported by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts  --  a Federal Agency . " That means tax dollars are joining with private monies to bring a richer life to millions of Americans . Now private support of the arts , so long the lifeblood of our culture , has a junior partner , a retiring and discreet partner that stands helpfully in the wings . The agency symbolizes the belief of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great culture  --  and that culture is for people . In the next six pages , we show you some of the projects through which the Endowment has brought Americans a new realization of their culture . Not everyone gets to museums . But no one can help noticing what 's on our public squares as they walk to work  --  or play . Since 1967 , the Endowment has contributed nearly two and one-half million dollars for works of art in over forty cities and towns all over America . Continued on page 83 As medieval muralists once thrilled to the sight of new and unadorned walls on which to paint their creations , modern artists have discovered the sides of outmoded buildings as the perfect plane for their paintings . This one is by Nel Pekarsky , at Houston and Crosby Streets , in New York City , for all who care to see and enjoy . // And from the mayor right down to the children , local communities have responded magnificently . Mayor Gerry Graves of Lansing started off the private contributions with a $1,000 gift from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Lansing , Michigan . Twenty-one thousand children offered their pennies and dimes to bring the Rosati to Wichita . The artists really come to town . James Rosati net with the children , offered helpful comments on their work , discussed sculpture with leading citizens . He stimulated such an interest that small towns around Wichita began to fund their own public art programs . Nancy Hanks , author of this article , is Chairman of the National Endowment For The Arts , which , although a federal subsidy for the arts , encourages the cultural community to combine federal , state , municipal and private support in a consortium . Can artists help make contributions to other arts ? Yes , say these results of a trial program  --  Visual Arts in the Performing Arts  --  run by the Endowment this year . The idea was to help orchestras , dance and theater companies hire American artists to design posters , sets and costumes for outstanding productions . The program gives an artist , who has perhaps spent years working alone , the opportunity to interact with other artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . And equally important , it enables performing arts companies to hire talent that otherwise would be way beyond their budget . For three years now a brightly painted six-car train has steamed thousands of miles through Michigan  --  where it originated  --  and the American West . It has brought Picasso and Renoir far from the great museums and art centers into small Continued on page 135 // continued from page 133 Vulcan , the mighty iron figure that towers over The Club , and Red Mountain and Birmingham ( world 's largest iron figure of Vulcan ; can you name another ? ) has been put to many uses by the city . It was conceived as an entry in the St. Louis Exposition of 1904 , shipped back to Birmingham where it lay until 1936 , forgotten and forlorn , in the state fairgrounds . For a time , it held a bottle of pop in its outstretched hand . Then  --  with WPA funds , it was moved to Red Mountain where it towers 120 feet over its base and is visible from all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a traffic fatality . On its base is inscribed .. o'er and o'er nature hath flung her treasures with a generous hand and Birmingham sits enthroned . " O'er and o'er Birmingham has had some tough times . And she has survived them , even profited from them . This might suggest that the treasure nature generously flung was people . As the city begins its second century  --  not much of an event in the ancient South  --  it is broadening its foundation to include all its people . It had always the base for making a living . Now it has made a beginning in the business of living , an infinitely more serious task . Some of the people from the gala are pouring into The Club now . The ladies , unless memory fails , have changed clothes again . The gala has communities like Kalispell , Montana , and Grand Junction , Colorado . It 's mirrored inside to expand the sense of space ; there visitors move from a 2,000-year-old Greek head of Apollo in one transparent case to an Egyptian mummy mask in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America 's present . In one car a traveling group of artists , printmakers and potters illustrate how art gets made  --  right there on the spot . Ray Scott , who dreamed up the idea , says " In some small towns , ARTrain is the biggest event in town . " The illustrations give an audience's-eye view of ARTrain during a stopover in Aspen , Colorado . No one has expressed more felicitously the role of art participation and enjoyment than J. Irwin Miller , Chairman of the Cummins Engine Company . In words seemingly more appropriate to the head of the art department at a great university than the head of a great American industrial corporation , Mr. Miller stirs us to a fuller appreciation of the life around us : " You can watch each generation die , if you have eyes for it . Beginning in kindergarten we start the job . Color it green , and stay within the lines . Never mind why . ' So the exuberant fun that a kid can have withraised a lot of money for the hospital . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It might be a paradigm for the business of living that the city 's second century will devote itself to . " It was one of the most glamorous evenings this city will ever know , " says the Birmingham News 's women 's editor Jo Ellen O'Hara . " A predecessor of things to come . " George Delfavero , a man everybody describes as the nicest guy in Birmingham , engineered the gala , turned the caverns of the civic center into the intimate assembly rooms where the city could celebrate itself and America 's legendary women . He also thought of the idea , lit it with the Roman candle of Mrs. Swearingen , and through the long hot summer before the dressing up , before the diamonds came out of vaults , before the fun , George worked . ( They call it " coordinating , " but it 's drudgery . ) The nuns from the hospital and George . A familiar sight . Now , tonight , George is in his modesty triumphant , giving everyone else credit , stepping back for the celebrities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much praise . Someone says to George 's wife , assuming , one supposes , George had done all this merely for his church , say , to get into heaven , " George is such a good Catholic . " Mrs. Delfavero smiles and George mutters , " H I 'm a Baptist . " His is the kind of motiveless motive that can make a town a home . paints and crayons is snuffed out . " And then there is the teenager whose instinct is to find in religion joy and noise and color and excitement and answers to real questions . Instead the church feeds him answers mainly to the questions adults feel comfortable in answering . Is it any wonder that repeated Sunday services which seem to him like undifferentiated funerals finally turn him off religion for good , and even succeed in becoming the beginning of his own funeral as it becomes less acceptable for him to question openly and embarrassingly ; to shout ; to cry ; to release his exuberance . " Finally we see the young men and young women whose homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; who have read their last poem ; who have looked at their last picture ; whose childlike awareness and powers of imagination have been safely pressed into conformity shortly before they enter into the dimly felt tragedy of middle age . " But the child in us all was once briefly awake . And the child in us saw more than we see now , felt more than we feel now , created in his imagination more than we are able to create now . The child in us is the artist in us , and it is the very best part of us. " 2:1
