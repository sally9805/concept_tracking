American Mischief , by Alan Lelchuk . Farrar , Straus &; Giroux , $8.95 . Breakfast of Champions , by Kurt Vonnegut , Jr . Delacorte Press , $7.95 . The Devil Tree , by Jerzy Kosinski . Harcourt Brace Jovanovich , $6.95 . WHENEVER I HEAR SOMEONE use the word " reality , " I want to reach for a custard pie . It has been a long time now since anybody who used the word " reality " knew what he was talking about . Physicists and meta-physicists alike only multiply uncertainty principles . What is mind ? asks one . No matter , says the other . What is matter ? Never mind . With refinements , that dubious distinction seems to have taken us about as far as we can go . For all that , there seem to be more reality-instructors around than ever . I mean those characters who with a sincere or a threatening look insist on telling us what really is what , characters who usually turn out to be either con men or bullies , or both at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the case so that we will act in such and such a way ? the way in question , of course , being one that will benefit them materially or justify them morally . But to the extent that we are social beings we are all con men of one sort , reinforcing ourselves and others in our shared assumptions about what is what , what we should believe , what we should do , what we are like . For these assumptions serve to confirm us in all we have to do if we want to be together . They reward with bouquets and encores those who perform their assigned roles . They discourage with hoots and a sense of having been miscast in New Haven those who balk or who stumble over their lines . These latter become anxious , or anomic , or ironic ; they become critics , or criminals , or paranoids . They become characters in search of the one play designed expressly to show that all the rest of the world is only a stage . More and more during the past one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the script has been lost . That the reality-instructors have only forgeries to peddle . That to play any part at all you have to improvise . That to play your part straight is to be no more than a straight man . That reality to pull on the reins of a runaway trope has absconded , and with it went the secure ego of the solid citizen . The suspicion has become general , I believe . The result is that we have all become anxious , or anomie , or ironic ; Critical , or criminal , or.aaranoid . With the absconded reality went realistic fiction , which is the echo in words of secure realities and solid citizens . Modern writers found themselves sharing the assumptions of Gorgias of Leontini , who in 427 B.C. won renown at Athens for maintaining , among other things , that : ( 1 ) Nothing exists . ( 2 ) H anything exists , it can not be known . ( 3 ) If anything exists , and can be known , it can not be put into words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding words to express the nothing that can not be put into words . Against the fictions of religion , history , philosophy , science , and common sense , they opposed the supreme fiction of literature , whose job as they saw it was to expose the fiction of reality . Their experiments with words were designed to shatter the world in which people who lived amid secure realities and among solid citizens were preserved in their ways . Their project was to liberate us from the fictitious and the factitious so far as eon men and bullies used them to hold us in thrall . They were unrealistic with a vengeance ; they were reality-instructors with reverse English . They were critical , criminal , and paranoic in behalf of sanity . They were ironic to boot ? about many things , but especially about themselves and about what they were doing . They were ironic in the first place because , like con men and bullies , they were propagators of fictions , but their irony was also meant to show that they were not conned by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader from being bullied by his own will to believe . They intruded into their fictions capriGeorge Stade is chairman of the English De . part:meat at Columbia University . and at whim , or they compared themselves to the fictitious Creator of the Universe and accordingly refined themselves out of existence . Whatever they did , they could not present themselves as secure egos sharing a world with solid citizens . For all that , they saw themselves as heroes . Ironic heroes , but heroic just the same , heroic precisely because they were ironic about their heroism , and because , unlike the fictitious Creator of the Universe , they put their fictive worlds in order . Against the perceived and experienced world , unprecedented for its chaos , that they represented in their fiction , these writers asserted an aesthetic rendering unprecedented for its order . Modernist literature is extraordinary as much for the order of the representation as for the disorder of what is represented . The heroism of modernist writing , in sum , the basis of its claim to be supreme among fictions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its subversive relation to the fictions that pass for reality , and on its defiant assertion of a human and aesthetic order in the face of an inhuman and existential chaos . W HICH BRINGS US to Kurt Vonnegut , who with his new novel , his best so far , has become for me a hero of modernist culture . Breakfast of Champions is a minutely ordered representation of cosmic chaos . It endorses the only values that can he endorsed , given the chaos . and it endorses them the only way they can be endorsed ( given the chaos ) , and that is ironically , but they are endorsed just the same . They are endorsed by a plot in the course of which the novel 's characters restore its author 's health . What they believe and what they do serve equally to reveal the source of his distress and the grounds for health . They are calculated to serve us in the same way , but they will do so only if we will submit ourselves to their reality , as does their author , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the " Preface " to Breakfast of Champions occurs this passage : What do I myself think of this particular hook ? I feel lousy about it , but 1 always feel lousy about my books . My friend Knox then perhaps , citizens not in the literary trades will understand that there is no order in the world around us , that we must adapt ourselves to the requirements of chaos instead . Is Vonnegut serious about all this ? Vonnegut-Studge is serious enough about it to have one of his characters , Dwayne Hoover , a Pontiac dealer , go mad and run amok upon reading , there in the cocktail lounge , a novel by Kilgore Trout . IrrIHE NOVEL that tips Hoover over I into insanity is Now It Can Be Told , which is in the form of a letter from the Creator of the Universe to an experimental creature . " Dear Sir , poor sir , brave sir : " Hoover reads , " You are an experiment by the Creator of the Universe . You are the only creature in the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who has to figure out what to do next - and why . Everybody else is a robot , a machine . " Dwayne takes all this as addressed to him personally , rather than to the species of which he is a member ; he gathers that only he thinks and feels , worries and plans . " Everybody else was a fully-automatic machine , whose purpose was to stimulate Dwayne . " In the course of his rampage he sends eleven other members of his species to the hospital , under the impression that they are only machines who can feel no pain and whose purpose is only to stimulate and divert him . " Why should I care what happens to machines ? " The episode of Hoover 's madness looks at first like a parable with a moral : if people are programmed by the Creator of the Universe to believe what they believe and to do what they do , programmed , that is , to believe that they are free , but to do unto others as though others were machines , then only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , much of Breakfast of Champions , which begins with an epigraph from Job , reads like an anti-theodicy . Thinking of the Star of Bethlehem ? " a whole galaxy going up like a celluloid collar " ? Kilgore Trout remarks that " God was n't any conservationist . " And thinking of the poison of snakes , including the snake in the Garden of Eden , Vonnegut-Stodge remarks . " Sometimes I wonder about the Creator of the Universe . " But according to Kilgore Trout , the Creator of the Universe is also a machine , programmed to program us in the way he does , as Vonnegut is programmed to write in the way he writes when he is programmed as Philboyd Studge . " I was on a par with the Creator of the Universe there in the dark in the cocktail lounge . " At one point Kilgore Trout begins to suspect that he is sitting next to the person who created him . " He was embarrassed . It was hard for him to know how to respond , particularly since his responses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of Kilgore Trout , the creator of this fictional universe says , " I had given him a life not worth living , but I had also given him an iron will to live . This was a common combination on the planet Earth . " And in imitation of his own Creator , Vonnegut-Studge does not practice poetic justice , which rewards the good and punishes the had : " This is n't the kind of book where people get what is coining to them at the end . " He is capricious and whimsical . He is too impatient to revise impossibilities : " Let it stand , let it stand ! " But unlike the fictitious Creator of the Universe , the creator of this universe of fiction comes to discover that there are limits to his control over his characters . " I could only guide their movements approximately , since they were such big animals . " The characters begin to affect him as much as he affects them . When Dwayne Hoover runs amok , his creator gets hurt too : " Somebody jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he broke my watch crystal , even though I had created him , and he broke my toe . " He discovers that " a writer off-guard , since the materials with which he works are so dangerous , can expect terror as quick as a thunderclap . " But along with the terror , the characters , especially a minimal painter named liako Karabeklan ( in an earlier Vonnegut novel there is a character called Karadokian ) , give Vonnegut-Studge grounds for health and a will to live . Until his encounter with the minimal painter , Vonnegut-Studge was anything but serene . He had " come to the conclusion that there was nothing sacred about myself or about any human being , that we were all machines , doomed to collide and collide and collide . " His novels were written about collisions for fans of collisions . But when Karabekian defends his painting ? a canvas twenty by sixteen feet , covered entirely with Hawaiian Avocado ( a green wall paint ) , except for a vertical stripe from top to bottom of day-glo orange reflecting tape ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in all other human beings . It is awareness , an unwavering band of light . " I give you my word of honor , " Balm Karahekiart tells the citizens of Midland City , who regret having paid $50,000 for his painting , " that the picture your city now owns shows everything about life that truly matters , with nothing left out . " It is a picture of awareness , of the immaterial core , of the " I am " to which all messages are sent . " Our awareness is all that is alive and maybe sacred in any of us . Everything else about us is dead machinery . " From this point on in the novel , its author recognizes his characters as both machines ? and therefore comic and pitiable ? and as unwavering bands of light , and therefore sacred , But Kilgore Trout has become aware of awareness before his creator , which is the sort of thing that sometimes happens in the novels of authors who believe in unwavering hands of light . Before lie dies in 1981 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but from it ) , Trout becomes aware that awareness leads to sympathy , a recognition of the unwavering bands of light in others , and to charity for the antics of the machine . His awareness leads him to the recognition that bad ideas are to the band of light as had chemicals are to the machine : " Bad chemicals and had ideas were the Yin and Yang of madness . " He becomes a " fanatic on the importance of ideas as causes and cures for disease . " Dwayne Hoover goes violently mad because of chemicals and because of the had idea that other humans are only machines . " We are healthy only to the extent that our ideas are humane , " says Trout in a quotation from his last novel that is engraved on his tombstone . Awareness makes Kilgore Trout humane , as , in my opinion , it does Kurt Vonneva , who as the creator of his fictional universe says to one of his characters what the Creator of the Universe has yet to he heard saying to anyone : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of awareness is the very substance of this novel . And it leads Vonnegut to endorse the only values that can he endorsed ( given the chaos ) , which are the virtues of the heart ? imaginative sympathy with other bands of light and charity for other machines . As a character in Malraux says , " If you believe in nothing , especially because you believe in nothing , you 're forced to believe in the virtues of the heart when you come across them , no doubt about it . " Arid the awareness of this novel of itself as a novel is part of its assertion of the human against the mindless and mechanical chaos of reality that the novel represents . Another constituent of that assertion is the how of the representation , the aesthetic rendering , which stands against the what that is represented . The relations of part to part and part to whole are Byzantine and beautiful . Every part of the representation , whether assholes or plastic or the Creator of the Universe , is linked to every other part to form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real world without end that has been whirled without aim . " It is hard to adapt to chaos , but it can he done . I am living proof of that : It can be done . " Given the fidelity with which this fictional order represents real chaos , all I can say to any fellow hands of light about to read this novel , people about to go Trout fishing in America , is what one character in Breakfast of Champions says to another : " Welcome to the real world , Brother . " METE DIALECTIC in Jerzy Kosinski 's 1 work is not between fiction and reality but between reality and the fantasies that usurp or evade it . In The Painted Bird ( 1965 ) , his first novel , the images of reality glitter like hallucinations . Their brilliance is as of a light that has no source but the objects it illuminates , just as hallucinations gleam in the obscure light of what they mean to those who have them . The fine-ground prose , like a lens , serves only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tint or refraction of an authorial attitude toward the shocking images it magnifies to a supranatural clarity . Precisely at that moment when the reader 's inner eye gets used to the dazzle , a Gestalt shift occurs , the images of reality blink into fantasies of sinister violence and sexual violation . Reality becomes the image of our secret fantasies of lust and cruelty . It is transformed by the unadmitted and unobtainable desires of which it then becomes an image . It becomes , that is , uncanny . The uncanny is the effect of a repressed wish embodied in a perceptible form , as in hallucinations and horror stories . It is the effect of a coincidence of fantasy and reality . The achievement of The Pointed Bird is to provide us images for those uncanny moments when the lust and cruelty we evade by repression return to usurp reality . The achievement of Kosinski 's second novel , Steps ( 1968 ) , on the other hand , is to provide us with images that bring into focus the reality of our fantasies . The tension in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantasy and inhibition . Step by step , through a series of short vignettes , Kosinski takes us deeper and deeper into fantasies of cruelty and violation , of which his favorites are the gang-hang and fellatious rape . Each vignette takes us one step further beyond the facade of common-sense reality and one step further beyond the agencies of inhibition . Kosinski forces us to imagine what we fear we desire . His third novel , Being There ( 1971 ) , is a fantasy of the type exemplified by daydreams , rather than by nightmares or hallucinations . The mind goes slack and is released to float after its own pleasure without the drag of either inhibition or reality . A booby , an illiterate , a wise innocent named Chance , who has grown up dividing his time between a garden and a television set , is ejected from his foster father 's mansion by that worthy 's death ; he is then taken up by high society and becomes a Presidential adviser . Being There is a kind of shaggy-dog story the punch line is not worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , I am sorry to say , with Kosinski 's new novel , The Devil Tree . Its hero is a young man who had been getting an allowance of $25,000 a month , until he comes into his inheritance as a majority stockholder of a conglomerate worth billions . His fortune allows him to transform his fantasies into realities . He travels all over . He makes complicated love to Anita , Ann , Barbara , Karen , Maria , Susan , and others . He plays practical jokes of sinister cruelty , one of which is murder . But heis not happy , the reason he gives being that he has a modernist sensibility . He suffers from " feelings of separation and estrangement , " as he puts it . " In order to be honest I must always play a number of roles at once . " And therefore , " I ca n't say anything about myself without at some point contradicting my own statement while believing both statements to be true . " One other thing he says about himself we might apply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreat to a world of fantasies in which I was always the victor . " Winning is easy , and so is writing novels , once you have evaded those drags , inhibition and what goes for reality . The " Author 's Note " to The Devil Tree is as follows : This book is wholly fantasy . Any resemblance to the objective present or past is gratuitous , and comparison to any actual event or character is accidental and not intended . And that is where the trouble lies . Fantasy is not fiction , although it may be the subject of fiction ? as in Kosinski 's first two novels . Fantasies are real ; people have them . Fictions , however , are not things that people have but things that people make . And that Kosinski can speak about an " objective present " is complementary evidence of his weak grip on the multiple unrealities that constitute the world in which at present we live . 4 LAN LELCIIUK , the author of , AAmerican Mischief , has not let himself be restrained by any recipes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only kind he has . His novel is a prime example of what Kilgore Trout dislikes about " realistic novels and their accumulations of nit-picking details . " American Mischief is 500 pages of unremitting explicitness and tendentious detail , but for all the recipes of realism , it reads like pure fantasy . The novel purports to be the memoirs of Lenny Pincus , a student radical from Cardozo College , which in most respects is like Brandeis University where Lelchuk teaches . Included in the memoir is a 140-page chunk of manuscript written by Dean Bernard Kovell , who relates with relentless pedantry his triumphs and tribulations in maintaining a harem of six gratified women . Each one ofthese women is the embodiment of a different masculine fantasy of lust or cruelty : the Whore , the Mother , the Sleeping Beauty , the Goodhearted Squaw , the Sadomasochistic Black , the Wasp Ice-Queen . Dean Kovell restores order to their messy lives , but not necessarily to his own , by asserting the authority of the male . When the women get out of line he cracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the success of his domestic arrangements he derives a politics : " The point was , once the reign of authority was weakened at the top , the entire fabric of society was threatened . Everyone suffered ? the man , the woman , the culture . And authority began with the family and the figure who sustained them : the man . " The moral of his manuscript is stated by the dean himself : " I 'm not very different from most nervous intellectuals of our day ? except perhaps that my life forms the substance of their dreams . " If Bernie Kovell 's life forms the substance of a nervous intellectual 's fantasy of desire , Lenny Pincus 's life forms the substance of a nervous intellectual 's fears about radical students . The substance of his life strikes me as roughly one part rumor and three parts the hysteria of Alan Lelchuk , that nervous intellectual . Pincus begins by participating in the despoliation of Picassos , Matisses , Cezannes , and so on in the Berg Art Museum . He masterminds the vandalisation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the burning down of the Widener Library . He plants bombs in theaters . He murders Norman Mailer . He debauches a fourteen-year-old girl , a runaway former cheerleader , whom he also helps turn into a prostitute , a groupie , and a drug addict , and whom he submits to frequent fellatious rape and to a gang-bang by Satanists . He kidnaps ten famous intellectuals , who in the novel are referred to as A. , B. , C. , D. , and so on , but who are recognizably Lionel Trilling , Daniel Bell , Irving Howe , Alfred Kazin , Paul Goodman , etc . These increasingly nervous intellectuals are subjected to some very nasty pranks . No student radicals have as yet spent much time even trying to do such things ; nor does Lenny 's life form the substance of their fantasies . Even less are Lenny 's black colleagues recognizable as anything but the fantastic product of Lelchuk 's fears . They BOOKS seem to spend most of their time raping blond girls and pissing on paintings , except when one takes time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though we hear Lelchuk trying to catch the accents of Mailer , Trilling , Bell . and so on , what comes to the reader 's inner ear is not satire , or parody , or even travesty , but simple inaccuracy . Of the kidnapped intellectuals , Lionel Trilling is subjected to the nastiest of the pranks . He and the others have been kidnapped , we are told , because they are spiritual fathers to Lenny Pincus and because student radicals , we are to understand , are parricidal . Trilling , however , is not in fact taken to be a spiritual father by twenty-five-year-old student radicals but by thirty-five-year-old literary intellectuals , such as Alan Lelchuk . What we quickly begin to feel is that Mailer , Trilling , Bell , and the rest are being subjected to nasty pranks not by a character in a fully realized world of fiction but by an author who has not been able to turn his fantasies into fiction . " Surely he 'd understand , " says Lenny as he is about to kill the fictional Mailer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lelchuk said to the real Mailer when the latter violently objected to the fictitious version of him in this fantasy posing as a novel . The point about realistic novels , of course , is that they have to be realistic . American Mischief is realistic only in method , not in substance . If the novel had been written by the Nabokov of Pale Fire , we could have read it as though Lenny Pincus and Bernie Kovell had invented each other . If it had been written by the Vonnegut of Breakfast of Champions , the author and his fantasies would have been transformed by the fiction . If it had been written by the Kosinski of The Painted Bird , we could have read it as a representation of how our fantasies about the lust and cruelty of student radicals have contaminated what goes for reality . But the realistic method will not allow us to read the novel in any of these ways . The method will not allow for the uncanny . And it is precisely the uncanny world of multiple unrealities as represented in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or bullied by the fantasies of reality-instructors such as Alan .
