txt The Group of 10 , an organization of leading Industrial nations , took a ' first step today toward resolving the world 's monetary turmoil . The finance ministers of the 10 countries agreed on a shortterm working program of negotiations for their deputies , emphasizing realignment of currency exchange rates and removal of the new United States 10 per cent import surcharge . While no country changed its position on substantive issues , the agreement apparently represented at least some concession by the United States , which was represented by Treasury Secretary John B. Connally . Mr. Connally 's concession was to accept the listing of the specific and immediate issues to be resolved , which included the- United States import surcharge . An alternative draft communique , originally supported by the American delegation , was more vague . I.M.F . to Meet The 10 countries reached their agreement on the eve of the annual meeting here of the International Monetary Fund , which is made up of 118 countries . No further negotiations on the monetary situation are expected during the I.M.F . meeting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ministers this morning , Mr. Connally took a more relaxed view than previously ' on one element of the dispute  --  the price of gold . " We do not have a hang-up about gold , " he said , adding that the United States recognized that for other countries it is a " political problem , not economic . " Mr. Connally reiterated President Nixon 's position , which so far opposes an increase in the price of gold as a technical means of devaluing the dollar against other currencies . The United States aim , he said , was // to " diminish " the role of gold in the world monetary system . But he added , " we do n't view it as a great problem . " Yesterday Pierre - Paul Schweitzer , managing director of the International Monetary Fund , urged that the United States make a contribution to a new set of currency exchange rates by devaluing the dollar through a small increase in the official gold price . This view has been taken by most of the other leading countries . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform of the monetary system . The United States aim , Mr. Connally reiterated , is to " receive assurances " from ' other countries that actions will be taken , including higher exchange rates for their currencies against the dollar , ' sufficient to end the long-standing deficit in the United States balance of international payments . How to do this  --  and the magnitude of the actions involved  --  will be the substance of negotiations that are to follow . The ministers ' deputies ? at the level of Paul A. Volcker , Under Secretary . of the Treasury for Monetary Affairs  --  will meet in mid-October , almost certainly in Paris , and possibly again later in October . If there is progress , the ministers could meet in November with a chance of reaching a package solution , but this is far from certain . ' Immediate Issues ' Today 's communiqu ? , instructing the deputies to begin their work , said the ministers had agreed that " the more immediate issues " included " the magnitude and method of a realignment of currencies , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abolition of the United States surcharge and some other measures , outside the exchange rate field , designed to improve the U. S. balance of payments . " There was no mention of the price ? of gold , an issue that has split off the United States from most of the others . However , the use of a possible small upward change in the gold price as a means of devaluing the dollar remains covered by the word " method " in the communique , in connection with the realignment of currencies . For the longer-term , the ministers reaffirmed previous instructions to the deputies to begin " exploring ways and means of reforming international monetary arrangements . " The reference to " wider margins " in the communiqu ? meant a generally agreed proposal that once new par values for the main currencies are negotiated , they should be allowed in the future to fluctuate more than the previously ? permitted 1 per cent on either side of par in daily trading . Regardless of the communique , the impending negotiations are bound to be difficult . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to a new set of currency exchange rates by a small technical increase in the price of gold , the amount of each country 's exchange-rate change will be a matter for hard bargaining . This will be the " final political decision , " in the view of Mario Ferrari-Aggradi , the Italian Treasury Minister , speaking on the National Broadcasting Company 's television program " Meet the Press . " Edgar J. Benson , the Canadian Finance Minister , who spent his last day today as chairman of the Group of ' 10 , said on the program that he did not anticipate that there could be an agreed new set of currency exchange rates ? apart from - the temporary changes now being produced by the floating of various currencies in daily trading  --  without removal of the ? United States import surcharge . Mr. Benson was succeeded by Mr. Connally as chairman under the system of alphabetical rotation that is traditional , using the French language first ? letter of each nation . The 10 members are the United States , Canada , Britain , Japan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Belgium . Switzerland sits as an observer .
