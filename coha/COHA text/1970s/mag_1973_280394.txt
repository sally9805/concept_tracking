THE DOLPHIN , 78 pages . $6.95 ; <P> HISTORY , 207 pages . $7.95 ; <P> FOR LIZZIE AND HARRIET , 48 pages . $6.95. by ROBERT LOWELL <P> Farrar , Straus &; Giroux . <P> At 56 . Robert Lowell is the country 's leading claimant to the title of major poet . Most of his generation-Theodore Roethke , Randall Jarrell . John Berryman , Delmore Schwartz-are dead . When Lowell published his first book . Lord Wearys Castle , right after World War II . critics overwhelmed him with praise . Over the years he has proved a poet of exceptional intelligence and technical craft rather than mercurial lyric gifts . <P> Two of these books-For Lizzie and Harriet and History-are reworkings of a long sequence of sonnets called Notebook . 1967-68 . Lowell wanted the work to be considered a single , variegated poem , and indeed it is an intertwined record of his preoccupation with politics , dead friends . his wife Elizabeth Hardwick , their daughter Harriet , and various literary and historical figures . Since then , Lowell has gone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of parting present , an extract from Notebook containing all the poems ( some now rewritten ) addressed to his daughter and former wife . <P> There are 80 new poems in History , as well as more fretwork done on the original sonnet group . The enlargement intensifies the problem that Notebook had from the start : too much trivia . The strong poems get lost in material that is simply organized jotting . <P> The Dolphin contains more bad news for Lowell 's admirers . These are all new poems . Most of them are fluent yet curiously flat . They represent a return to the preoccupations and personal style of Life Studies ( 1959 ) , Lowell 's best book and easily the most influential volume of American poetry published in the past 15 years . His writing about chronic mental disturbance and hospitalization opened a whole school of so-called confessional verse that flourished in the ' 60s . Sylvia Plath , Anne Sexton and W.D . Snodgrass , among others , wrote gruesome self-examinations stiff with hatreds and self-pity , openly mixing honesty , courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing else , helped clear away the academic style of the ' 50s . <P> It is depressing to find Lowell , more than a decade after the tension and vigor of Life Studies , in and out of yet another hospital ( " My twentieth in twenty years " ) , observing another small offspring , writing the same kind of stuff about London that he wrote about New York . By this time he even has the courage of his own callousness . Duly enclosed in quotation marks are poems fashioned from letters written by Elizabeth Hardwick after he left her . They may have been intended as literary strategy : contrasting a woman 's naked loss with her man 's fragile new happiness , his little son 's first steps ( " Small pets avoid him ... Who wants to shake hands with a dead friend ? " ) . In the inevitable 14-line casings , these poems are as listless as the rest . <P> Life Studies burst out after a spell of staleness in Lowell 's work , and one hopes that he will find fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengths-candor , elegance , a survivor 's dispassion and an energy that is missing in much of the book : <P> I have sat and listened to too many <P> words of the collaborating muse ,
