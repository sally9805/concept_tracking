 | A noted clergyman says : " LET 'S LEGALIZE GAMBLING Father William Van Meter believes adults should be allowed to take a chance on a ball game , a horse race , or even ? as he himself did ? on life itself The Reverend Canon William S. Van Meter is a tall , slender Episcopal priest of 57 , with bright attentive eyes that he seems almost to think with , a cheerful willingness to listen as well as talk , and a boyish face that lights up with delight at anything amusing or witty . Ordained in 1946 , Canon Van Meter was , until recently , Social Actions Director of New York City 's Council of Churches . Today , he stands squarely ? and publicly ? on the opposite side of the council 's position on legalized gambling . Says Father Van Meter : " Any law that most of the people do n't want enforced can not be enforced . The people want to bet ? on horses , numbers , sports ? and if the law says they ca n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bookmakers . " The council , on the other hand , takes this view : " We believe gambling to be a moral and social evil . It ... leads to social demoralization and the breakdown of personal integrity .. . " We . . . hold that any group or agency . . . which seeks profit from publicly promoted gambling thereby contributes to the moral continued on page 156 99 59  | and economic breakdown of our society . " It was at a public hearing in New York City , on November 18 , 1971 , that Canon Van Meter took his stand . " The council argued for the repeal of abortion laws , " he said . " It supports the repeal of laws against the private sexual behavior of consenting adults . It reasons that no religious group should force its views on other religious groups or those with no religion at all . But I also believe the same logic applies to gambling . If a person is old enough and wants to bet , that is his business . The church can argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Though he formulated his views on public wagering only recently , Van Meter was first exposed to gambling in the mid-1930s , while he was a student at Asbury College , near Lexington , Ky. , in the heart of the bluegrass region and its celebrated horse farms . " Being around thoroughbred horses made you interested in racing , " he says today . " Besides , Louisville was only two hours away , and who would n't want to attend a Kentucky Derby ? " Bill was 23 when he and some classmates piled into a car and headed for Louisville on Derby Day . Ninety percent of Asbury 's students were Methodists , and Bill , from a strict Methodist family himself , was against gambling at the time . " Drinking , dancing , movie-going and card playing were absolutely forbidden at home , " he recalled recently . " We could n't even play Parcheesi , because it required the throwing of dice . The only game allowed was dominoes , which happens to be a great gambling game in Italy and South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , there would have been no dominoes either . " It is no wonder that Bill 's memory of his first Kentucky Derby is so vivid . Lacking the money to buy an admission ticket , he paid ten cents for the right to climb a ladder over the backstretch fence of Churchill Downs . " The man who owned the ladder did a good business , " Bill recalls . " Hundreds used it . Then there was the infield fence , and I paid another ten cents for permission to climb through a hole in that . " There were thousands of people milling about on the grounds , and here and there gamblers were challenging all corners at three-card monte or the shell game . A shill ? that 's a fellow working with a gambler ? would come along , place a bet , win and walk away . This would lure ten onlookers to place bets ? but of course they would all lose . Five minutes later , the shill would return to repeat his performance before a fresh group of spectators . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But what impressed Bill most was the sight of so much money changing hands , the eagerness on everyone 's part to spend it , and the excitement generated by such a mass belief in luck . Even food and drink was left to chance . People who were jammed in at the rail and could n't reach refreshment stands were only too eager to pay teen-agers with portable iceboxes a dollar ( enough for a complete meal in 1937 ) for a bottle of pop . When supplies of that ran out , they unhesitatingly paid a quarter for a paper cup of water . The horse named War Admiral won the Derby that year , and the infectious excitement of the crowd prompted Bill ( " Standing near the finish line is what hooked me " ) to place the first wager of his life . " I bet a friend that War Admiral would lose the Preakness that year . War Admiral won , of course , and then went on to win the Belmont as well ? one of the few horses to win the triple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambler as a result of that losing bet . His attitude remained the same ; he was against public gambling . But his personal life was about to present him with a chance-taking challenge that " had nothing to do with money , " Bill says today , " but with the winning or losing of life itself . " It began in 1940-41 , during his preordination days at the Nashotah House Seminary in Nashotah , Wis . The seminary students who could not afford to go home for Christmas ( Bill was one of them ) were invited to attend a dance in a nearby town on Holy Innocence Day , which fell on December 28 . " I danced most of the evening with a local girl , Jane Weber , though she was n't the girl I was paired off with , " Bill recalls . " We hit it off right away . A few weeks later , we were spending an afternoon together when we came upon a stray cat . " ' I 'd never marry a man who did n't like cats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , ' I like cats . ' " It was so sudden , I did n't know what had happened . We just looked at each other , and I kept thinking : God , what have I done ? I mean , I had n't proposed to her , and she had n't proposed to me . But I kept saying to myself , ' This is it . ' " The couple 's struggles were about to begin . There were strong objections to the marriage ? medical , not personal 156 ones ? on the part of Jane 's mother , who was a registered nurse , and several doctors . In addition to a history of rheumatic fever and hemorrhagic nephritis ( a kidney disease ) , Jane had a heart problem called subacute bacterial endocarditis . She was not expected to live long , and the bearing of a child , would mean certain death . Before they made their final decision , Jane 's mother , concerned and determined to help ' staked Bill and Jane to a visit to the ' clinic at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examined Jane , " Blli says today , " and they confirmed the heart problem and the fact that we could never risk having children . If Jane becomes pregnant , ' they warned us , she will have to have a therapeutic abortion without delay . ' " It was Love Story with a different ending . On July 3 , 1941 , Bill and Jane were married anyway . He had no reason to hope that she would live long . but rather than risk even a therapeutic abortion , he underwent a vasectomy . " I knew that meant that chances were I 'd never father a child , even if I lost Jane , " Bill says . " But I was n't thinking of losing her . I refused to believe she would die , even though the doctors only gave her from five to ten years . " Bill 's big gamble was not easily won . In 1944 , two years before he was ordained a priest , Jane came down with an infection perilous for anyone with her medical history ? a strep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portland , Ore . ( Bill was serving as a vicar in various parishes across the country ) , and when she was released . Bill nursed her at home . Three years later , another massive infection forced her into a hospital in Boston , where she was given five million units of penicillin intravenously every day for three weeks . Bill was by her side hour after hour , and when he took her home he himself administered the penicillin ? in reduced amounts ? every three hours until the infection subsided . There were other close calls over the years . Indeed , Jane has spent months in the hospital ? yet her married life has spanned 31 years . During the last ten , she has been able to work fulltime at various office jobs . " Marrying Bill is the reason I 'm alive today , " Jane said recently . " He fought for me when everyone else threw in the sponge . To make things easier for me. he even learned to cook . We work is this way : He prepares the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talk about Women 's Lib ! Bill was Join 30 years ago what women want men to do today . " Deeply involved in the big gamble of his marriage , Van Meter did not give much thought to gambling in general , much less to the legalization of gambling . Then last year , when the Council of Churches in New York City came out for the repeal of abortion laws and laws against what are now continued on page 157  | commonly called " victimless crimes , " he cut through the rhetoric and took a moral stand similar to the one he took when he decided , against all odds , to marry Jane Weber . When the council , for example , said that the private homosexual behavior between two consenting adults was not a crime because there was no victim , Canon Van Meter went further and included prostitution as well . " The private sexual behavior of the prostitute and her client is not a crime for the same reason , " Van Meter says . " There is no victim . " All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , Van Meter remained opposed to it . " For one thing , OTB originated as a revenueraising scheme , and we on the council expected the poor to suffer . They would bet more than they could afford to lose , so that the revenue raised by OTB would have to be siphoned off to support an increased welfare load . In fact , we expected church people ? clergy as well as parishioners ? to raise a storm of protest . But the storm turned out to be scarcely a shower . " When the expected rise in the welfare load did not materialize , and OTB developed none of the drawbacks anticipated by its opponents , Van Meter began to have second thoughts . " If you 're going to repeal laws against abortion and victimless crimes on the grounds that no religious group should force its views on other religious groups , " Van Meter reasoned , " you must legalize gambling too . Officially , the Episcopalians , Jews and Roman Catholics do not believe gambling is immoral . " If Van Meter had any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Knapp Commission hearings on organized crime in New York , in November of last year . Today , Canon Van Meter is a staunch supporter of legalized gambling primarily because of the part organized crime plays in illegal gambling . He strongly disagrees with the members of the Council of Churches who " consider the various bills for the extension of pari-mutuel gambling , for provisions for any kind of off-track betting or bookmaking and for various types of lotteries for municipal or state support ... to be wrong and antisocial . " In Canon Van Meter 's view , " organized crime is well-served by religious groups . The more the churches fight legalized gambling , the more organized crime benefits . The point is , people are going to gamble whether it 's legal or not . Why not legalize it , then , pay off higher odds than the bookies do , and cut off the billions of dollars organized crime collects every year from illegal , gambling ?
