BLACK SCREEN Black screen . I would like this to be sustained for a while , perhaps even a bit longer than it is in most cases , so that the audience becomes very quiet , wondering if something might not possibly be wrong . Then , from the speakers , there is a small but persistent sound , very small and very persistent , but at first unidentifiable . The audience should be made to listen very intently , and when we have reached the point where this is happening , we should gradually increase the volume of the sound until it is unmistakably that of running water . All sound should then stop suddenly . Another brief and total silence . Quick burst of overly-loud 12-string guitar finger-picking music , a fast , showy piece like " Buckdancer 's Choice . " This is cut off abruptly in the middle of a phrase . Very slowly we fade in without sound , then we focus , and we are close in on a tabletop , pleasantly scarred and perhaps a little hacked-up with initials . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we look at it , a roll of paper is placed , and several hands unroll it across the table . We see hands placing beer steins , full and half full of dark and light beer , on the corners of the map . We close in yet further on the map , until it covers the entire screen and the beer steins disappear , and we are on a certain section . In fact , we seem to be in it , and are able to read the place-names . It is a topographical map , so we are able to read the names of mountains and rivers and creeks and gaps and valleys and bridges . We should give the viewer time to discover that he has heard of none of them . They are  --  2  --  strange , local , country-sounding , idiosyncratic names , like Grimes ' Nose and Noontootley Creek . A single hand comes in , and seems to hover over the paper in what is at the same time an authoritative and yet almost a ceremonial way . Then all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes slowly and decisively down on a single point . Over this movement , and at the exact second when the finger touches the paper , we come up with the title DELIVERANCE all the way across the screen , in letter-design as desired . The other credits may then be given as desired , and in the case of each credit , it should disappear for long enough for the viewer to take in a few more names on the map , or , if desired , the camera may range about on the map , discovering more names and places . But each time the viewer should be aware that the camera returns to the place the hand has originally designated . If desired , the hand may also return during various of the credit designations . This can be worked out between myself and the director and the cameraman . After all credits have been presented , we hold on the map just a little while longer , so that the audience suspects that perhaps some more credits are due , and then we pull slowly up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the muscular , blue-veined hand in close-up one more time , and then have it pull back as though it had finished making its point . With this we also come back , and reveal LEWIS , BOBBY , and DREW sitting in a suburban or urban bar which is fixed up like a quaint gay-nineties sort of place , with old paintings of reclining nudes , a player piano , a bartender with a mustache and armbands , and so on . The only out-of-tune note here is that the waitresses , though not topless , are almost so , and one of the three men  --  anyone but LEWIS  --  occasionally glances at the behind of one of the waitresses in sheer-net tights as she goes by . Perhaps it would be better if it were BOBBY who does this , though the action should not be obtrusive . We see this scene as though we were sitting in the position occupied by ED . It is summer , and the bar is obviously air-conditioned . Either BOBBY or DREW has his coat off , or both of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed for warm weather . They are in short-sleeved business shirts and ties . On the other hand , LEWIS is not .  --  3  --  The camera faces him , as he sits there in an expensive sport shirt , lean and enormously powerful . He is not ostentatious about this , but quietly authoritative , as if he knew exactly what he were talking about , not only in this instance but in any . When the waitresses pass the table , he is the one they look at . &nbsp; LEWIS ( touching the map briefly once more ) Well , like I say , gentlemen , there it is . The vanishing wilderness . &nbsp; BOBBYYeah , we hear about it all the time . &nbsp; LEWISMost of what you hear is right . It 's all going . This part too . ( he gestures toward the map ) . &nbsp; BOBBYWhere is this part going ? &nbsp; LEWISUnderwater . When they take another survey and rework this map , this area I 've been talking about will all be blue . The dam at Aintry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next winter the river will back up fast . The whole valley will be underwater . But right now  --  right now as we sit here  --  it 's wild , and I mean wild . We really ought to get up there and see it . We 're damn fools if we do n't . When it goes it 'll be long gone . Cut to ED . ED wears a typical summer southern-city business suit , perhaps seersucker or some other light material . He has his jacket on , and looks a little more uncomfortable and proper than the others . &nbsp; ED ( in a slightly bantering but obviously admiring way ) You-all do n't know what this guy 's already put me through ! I 've been down in caves with him , I 've been up in trees , I 've been hunting for deer and fishing for nonexistent trout . I 've been in gymnasiums where the stink would drive you through the wall . Now it 's on a river , eh ? &nbsp; LEWISYeah , on a river . The goddamned most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the little bit of it I 've seen is any indication . &nbsp; EDI 'll go along . For some reason I always do . But what 're we proving , Lewis ? &nbsp; LEWISMaybe nothing , maybe everything . Now tell the truth , buddy . You ever regretted going with me ?  --  4  --  &nbsp; ED ( hesitating just a little , but not much ) No , but sometimes I 've had the shit scared out of me . Like when it was your idea to put our lights out in that cave " to hear the very sound of the earth , " as you said , and then could n't get them back on . &nbsp; LEWISBut we got ' em back on , did n't we ? &nbsp; EDFinally , but my God .... I 'll take the river . &nbsp; DREWWell , by damn , let 's do take it ! I need to get out some . I 'm getting too soft . I ca n't even climb the steps to my office without worrying about a hear attack . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that this is the kind of thing that gets hold of suburban dwellers once in a while . But most of them just lie down till the feeling passes . &nbsp; LEWISAnd when most of them lie down they 're at Woodlawn before they think about getting up . &nbsp; BOBBYI mean , the whole thing does seem kind of crazy . &nbsp; LEWIS ( looking down ) All right . Let me demonstrate . What are you going to be doing this afternoon ? &nbsp; BOBBYOh ... most likely I 'll see a couple of new people about mutual funds . I have to draw up some papers and get them notarized . &nbsp; LEWISHow about you , Drew ? &nbsp; DREWHire some more route salesmen . Our newest carbonated miracle is not selling like we want it to . The whole soft-drink market is in a slump now , especially our share of it . Somebody 's got to find out why . &nbsp; LEWISEd ? &nbsp; EDTake some photographs for Kitts Textile Mills . Kitt'n Britches . Cute girl in our britches stroking her pussy . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tolerant grin as he leans back ) Too bad . But have I made my point ? &nbsp; BOBBYWe left out somebody . How about you , Lewis ? What are you going to be doing ?  --  5  --  &nbsp; LEWISGetting ready to go up on the Cahulawassee River , by damn . And I might see one store tenant , if I feel like it . One . &nbsp; BOBBY ( who obviously does not know Lewis well ) Is that the way people live who do n't have to work for a living ? &nbsp; LEWIS ( easily ) Right . If they 've got the energy . &nbsp; BOBBYOK . I 'll go look at your dream country . Maybe you know something I do n't know . But I insist on some creature comforts . Namely liquor . &nbsp; LEWISBring all you like . In fact , the sensation of going down white water about half-drunk is not to be missed . &nbsp; DREWI 'm in , Lewis . Can I bring a guitar ? &nbsp; LEWISSure , bring it . It would be kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; DREWI 've got an old beat-up Martin that I could risk , I guess . Do n't worry ; I would n't bring my Number One Ax . &nbsp; EDYou taking your bow , Lewis ? &nbsp; LEWISYou know it . And if one of us stabs a deer we can eat the meat and pack the hide and the head out , and I 'll cure the hide and mount the head . &nbsp; BOBBY ( putting his finger in his ear and shaking it as though to clear it of water , in a mock gesture of disbelief ) I do n't believe what I 'm hearing . &nbsp; EDWell , you can believe it . If he says he 'll do it , he 'll do it , as I 've found out to my sorrow . &nbsp; LEWIS ( seeming a little hurt , but still full of conviction ) Always to your sorrow ? &nbsp; EDNo , Lewis . I was kidding . ( turning to the others ) You ought to see this guy in the woods . Why , he even taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd be damned good if you 'd get off your lazy butt every now and then and go out and shoot . &nbsp; EDI do n't know about that .  --  6  --  &nbsp; LEWISNo ; you 're naturally good , and believe me I 've seen a lot of archers in these tournaments around here . You 're very steady , and you can hold on a point almost as well as I can . And that weird kind of peep-sight you use in the string  --  the way you make it  --  well , that 's a real contribution . &nbsp; DREWSorry , fellows , but we do n't have time for any more compliments . Time to work . &nbsp; LEWIS ( very professionally and seriously ) Here 's the plan . I 'll call Sam Steinhauser this evening and see what shape his canoe 's in . Can you get your car , Drew ? &nbsp; DREWSure . One of them 's mine , and my boy 's not old enough to drive it . &nbsp; LEWISEd and I will meet you-all early Friday , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big new Wills Plaza Shopping Center . According to this map , there 's a little nothing town name of Oree that 's about where we want to put into the river . We can hire somebody up there to drive our cars down to Aintry , and we 'll come out there a couple of days later . We can be back here the middle of Sunday afternoon , in time for the last half of the pro game on old channel fourteen . We 'll see you Friday morning at about six-thirty . Wear tennis shoes . Bring liquor and an open mind . With a slightly exaggerated and ceremonial gesture , Lewis picks up two steins and the map leaps shut , and the force of its curling shut is a little unexpected . They all get up , and LEWIS stands tapping the rolled-up map like a rod in his hand and grinning , as they all begin to make their way through the tables toward the door . We follow ED as he goes out , and pull back from him just as the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner of anyone coming from comparative darkness into direct sunlight , he seems confused , but it should be shown that his confusion and discomfort are perhaps a trifle more than the ordinary , and are based , possibly , on something other than the change from darkness to light . A full , middle-distance shot now as ED begins to walk , and we see him , occasionally pulling at the stickiness of his jacket , walk along in an unorganized but plentiful procession of secretaries of all ages , most of them with exaggerated hairdos and tasteless summer clothing . If desired , the camera can pick out some of these faces in close-ups , showing a gumchewing  --  7  --  young one , a middle-aged one with a toothpick in her mouth , and various other unimaginative , commonplace , hopeless , everyday female human beings going back toward doing what they have to do . ED moves along in this procession , uncomfortable but resigned to it ; but , though he goes along quietly , it should be obvious that , though he can stand it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large leaf comes down . He stops for a moment and looks up , and as another leaf falls , he catches it in his hand . Close-up on leaf , which is beginning to turn with autumn . ED 's hand travels briefly around the edge of the leaf . He discards it and walks on . Long shot of ED in procession of women , which , it is now obvious , is headed for a big , modern office building . At a fountain in the front of the building where one of the women tosses in a coin , the procession divides , and in this division there is something both comical and ceremonial . ED goes around the fountain in his part of the line and enters the building . We are now inside the building , and relatively close-up on ED as he comes through the revolving doors . It is obvious that the air-conditioning is an enormous relief to him , and he shows this . He enters elevator as Muzak plays " Vienna Blood . " Women get off at various floors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweat off his face as the music continues to play , unstoppable . Shot of ED from inside elevator . Camera pans with him as he walks along hall , discreetly getting himself organized . The last door in the long , antiseptic hall is his office . Casual close-up on stylized Pegasus , which is the company 's emblem . Hold long enough for viewer to read on the glass of the door . EMERSON-GENTRYGraphics ConsultantsCommercial Art Medium shot of receptionist , who might have been one of the women walking back to the office with ED . &nbsp; EDAny calls ? &nbsp; RECEPTIONISTNot any awfully interesting ones , Mr. Gentry . Shadow-row Shell Homes would like to see the  --  8  --  comps next week . You had a request for a job interview from a young lady who would n't give her name , says she 'll call back . And the model is here for Kitts . &nbsp; EDThanks . I 'll go on back . We follow him through a rather large open-bay studio where some of the commercial artists that work for him are engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are propped back smoking , and one or two are hanging up their coats , just getting back from lunch . ED speaks to a couple of these ; his manner is friendly but not overly familiar . We see him open the door of his personal office , on which is written in gold-leaf letters EDWARD GENTRYVice President ED takes off his coat and sits down . Cut to Over-shoulder shot to disclose what is on his desk . ED picks up several roughs , drawings , samples of lettering , advertising headlines , half-finished comps , digs around in all this material and comes up with the ad for Kitt'n Britches . It 's a picture of a girl in nothing but panties holding a kitten and looking back over her shoulder at the reader . In a close-up we watch ED as he picks up a pencil and fiddles with some of the elements of the ad . He is vexed and concentrating , but gradually another expression  --  perhaps of disgust , boredom , fed-upness , simple ennui  --  comes over him . He shakes his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and goes to the door . The camera stands with him in the door as he looks out into the office . One of the men there has evidently made a joke , for some of the others , and one unattractive woman , are making efforts to laugh . The feelings that the shots of the office-space should convey ought to be those of futility , well-financed boredom , uselessness , organized tedium . We should feel these with ED as he stands there . Occasionally someone glances up at him , finds that he does n't want anything , then dismisses him and goes back to work , or speaks to someone else .  --  9  --  The phone in ED 's office rings . He goes back and picks it up . &nbsp; EDYou ready back there , Max ? All right . I 'll be down in just a second . ED goes back to his desk , picks up the Kitt 's ad , and moves out of the office . Cut to Section Details FULL SHOT OF THE INTERIOR OF THE PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO Full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ED comes in . It is bright with arc lights in there , and ED 's face winces just as it did when he came out of the saloon earlier . The place is full of arc lights , and people are moving around adjusting things . The model , in a black-and-white-checked robe , is sitting in a camp chair . An older woman , obviously an employee , is holding a kitten . Close-up of ED as he takes his place among these people . Once or twice he looks at the layout he 's brought , and then he looks quite deliberately at the girl . He goes over to her and motions for her to rise . She does so , and we come in on her , as she manages to convey , through the way in which she gets up , that she 's doing it for ED , and for no one else in the whole world . There should be no professionalism in this , no standard glamour , but just a simple and private act of giving . In close , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right into her right eye , where there is a curious-looking but unforgettable fleck of gold . &nbsp; EDDo you have a name ? &nbsp; GIRLYes . &nbsp; EDWhat is it ? &nbsp; VOICE OF THAD EMERSON , ED 'S PARTNERCome on , Ed . Quit screwing around . Let 's get this over with . Pull back to show expert studio confusion again . Men clear away newspapers from the place where the model will stand to be photographed . THAD points rather imperiously to some chalk feet marks on the floor , and the model shrugs and obeys , her eyes with what may be reluctance leaving ED's.  --  10  --  Various shots of the photographer getting ready to shoot , lighting technicians giving final adjustments to lights , and so on . The woman with the kitten moves up in front of the model , who now has her back to the camera , and to the camera the studio photographer is using . Shot through the ground glass of the photographer 's camera , showing the girl as it would do . Cut to Girl as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cut to Close-up of ED 's face , looking as though he wants to say " My God " but ca n't and wo n't . Cut to Girl 's feet in marks , then pan slowly up her entire body , stopping camera at shoulder-level as the woman hands her the cat . Pull back to show general confusion of studio , in which various professional voice commands are heard . We see and hear these things for a while , and among them ED stands with one hand musingly on his chin and the other holding the layout . Fade out , or get into the next scene in such a way as to suggest that it is the next morning . Darkness , not utter but nearly so . We are in a bed-room . The camera stands looking at the wall , and we can faintly hear a very small tinkle , like Chinese wind-bells . Come down and in on electric clock , which shows that it is six o'clock . Move to bed , where ED lies staring , not wide-open-eyed , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turns it so he can see it better . MARTHA moves toward him in a movement we can see is entirely habitual . She is definitely not glamorous , and she has her head wrapped in a towel or something of that kind : the sort of protective covering that sufferers from sinusitis wear to bed .  --  11  --  &nbsp; MARTHA ( mumbling ) Are you really going ? &nbsp; EDYeah . I think so . &nbsp; MARTHAWhat do you have to do to get ready ? &nbsp; EDNot much . Just throw on my old nylon flying suit and some tennis shoes . I piled all my stuff in the living room after you went to bed . &nbsp; MARTHADo you really want to go , baby ? &nbsp; EDI wo n't die if I do n't , I guess . But I 've got to get out of that studio for a while . Yesterday I just started to shake . I do n't know what the hell was wrong with me . Nothing mattered . Nothing mattered . I 'd just as soon the Russians 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , everybody . Maybe it 's all a mistake anyway . &nbsp; MARTHAIs it my fault ? Maybe it 's my fault . &nbsp; EDNo , not any more than it 's everybody 's fault . He turns to her .  --  12  --  &nbsp; EDOnly , it 's less your fault than anybody else 's . How about some loving , woman ? After all , I 'll be off in the woods for three days . &nbsp; MARTHAYou betcha ! ( then , in the practical manner of wives ) Can you reach the vaseline ? &nbsp; EDDo you always have to be so surgical about it ? ( But he likes this about her , and she knows it . ) &nbsp; MARTHA ( knowing this is something she can do ) What do you expect from an ex-surgical nurse ? Any nurse can tell you that sex is not romance . It 's practice . Whatever helps , helps . &nbsp; EDOK . OK . Do your thing . &nbsp; MARTHA ( after a short silence ) Which way do you want it , honey ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; MARTHAWill do . What follows now I will leave to the discretion and ingenuity of the director and the cameraman . There should be a confused but quite definite suggestion of sexual intercourse , not ecstatic but rhythmical and orderly . There might be a cut or two of MARTHA 's bare back heaving and the sound of her muffled sexual voice coming from the pillow . Out of this should come , as though called forth , an ectoplasmic image of the girl in the studio , and then a close-up of her face and then her eye , as she appears in ED 's mind . Through and beneath this might also still be suggested the heaving of MARTHA 'S back , as she dutifully labors . Cut to Interior of dimly-lit bathroom where ED , in a dressing gown , is quickly shaving . He pauses to scrutinize his face and his receding hairline , which he obviously does not like . His body is soft but strong , and he takes account of this . Cut to Full shot of dark living room , where ED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He appears in jockey shorts and goes over to it . MARTHA joins him , putting on her glasses , and in a robe and mules .  --  13  --  &nbsp; MARTHAHave you seen Dean ? &nbsp; EDNo . Is n't he in his room ? A child 's voice is heard close by , laughing . MARTHA and ED look at each other , for a moment uncertain of where it is coming from . They look down at the pile of equipment at their feet , and from behind it rises DEAN , brandishing a big hunting knife in the scabbard and playfully threatening them with it . ED joins the charade for a moment , pretending to be frightened , then takes the knife away from DEAN and throws it back on the pile . MARTHA goes off into the kitchen . In the half-dark , ED quickly pulls on a one-piece nylon flying suit , obviously well-worn or secondhand , then sits down and puts on socks and low-cut tennis shoes . DEAN sits with him and watches him . ED and DEAN get up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bow and arrows . He goes over to the sofa and turns on a floor lamp and stands looking at the bow . Close-up of bow , as he goes over the details of it . First he runs his hands over the limbs , and then checks the peep sight in the string , which is made with orange thread . Then he takes out one of the arrows from the bow quiver with which the bow is equipped . In close on the arrowhead , as the edge quivers , obviously terribly sharp , in the lamplight as he turns it this way and that . &nbsp; MARTHA 'S VOICE , OFFSCREENWell now , if you ai n't somethin ' ! What 's that getup supposed to mean ? Are you a weekend commando ? Or what ? ED grins , as we pull back to a two shot over them standing over the equipment . &nbsp; MARTHA ( suspiciously ) And what 's all that rope for ? You 're not going down in another cave , are you ? &nbsp; EDBelieve me , I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got this at the army surplus place where I got this other stuff : the knife and this flyboy outfit . Lewis says nylon dries out quick , and it seemed to me to be a good idea to get this . He also told me that you should never be in the woods without rope , so I bought a coil of this thin nylon stuff . We might be able to use it for something . &nbsp; MARTHAThe middle-aged boy scout !  --  14  --  &nbsp; EDOh , well ; for once in my middle age , I guess . MARTHA shakes her head in disbelief of such idiocy , and goes back into the kitchen . She comes out with a cup of coffee and a roll for ED , and he stands there eating and drinking silently , as DEAN messes with the equipment and MARTHA does a few wifely things around the living room . The sound of an automobile is heard , increasing and then stopping . &nbsp; MARTHAHere 's your hero . ED hands her the cup and plate . &nbsp; EDI almost forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take an extra bowstring , too . If you get up in the woods and break your only string , you 're just out of luck . ED leaves the room , and MARTHA stands uncertainly , looking at the equipment but not touching any of it . DEAN begins madly running and dodging around , shouting incoherently , as children will do when something unusual is going on . The doorbell rings , in a special kind of rhythm , like a prearranged code or signal . The camera view shifts into a position which is really that of ED as he moves from the bedroom back into the living room . The living room is seen through an odd , orange-tinged upright rectangle , which is the peep sight on the extra bowstring ED has gone to get . First we see part of the room framed by this , then the peep sight swings and frames MARTHA , who is moving to open the door , and then it attempts to frame DEAN , who is jumping and dodging madly . Just as ED gets DEAN centered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S , booms out . &nbsp; VOICEWhat ho ! The peep sight swings back to the door , and LEWIS is squarely framed in it , in camouflage outfit and an Australian bush hat . Cut to &nbsp; pp. 15-31 ED JUST TAKING DOWN THE BOWSTRING ED , just taking down the bowstring from his eye and putting it away in the leg pocket of his army-surplus nylon flying suit . He straightens , and we see that the leather identification tag above the left breast  --  15  --  has been cut off ; there are a few loose threads showing . &nbsp; LEWISLet 's break the pattern , buddy ! &nbsp; ED ( slightly embarrassed by LEWIS 'S flamboyance ) OK ! OK ! LEWIS is shown picking up very nearly all of ED 's equipment in one sleeve-rolled-up arm and hand . ED turns to say something to MARTHA , and then turns back to LEWIS , but LEWIS has already disappeared out the door . ED follows him outside . The camera is now near the car , which is parked in ED 's backyard . The usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swings , wagons , a cook-out grill , broken toys , a clothesline . We see LEWIS stowing ED 's equipment in the back of a station wagon . ED comes out of the house a little uncertainly , and moves to the car . Cut to What ED sees . His eyes move from LEWIS forward along the car , and then rise to the upside-down canoe strapped onto the roof . If possible , we should project a sense here that the canoe is going to be almost mystically important , though nobody knows why yet . ED 's eyes move back to LEWIS , who is about finished with his packing of the car . The last thing to go in is ED 's bow . LEWIS looks at this carefully before he puts it into the station wagon . He motions for ED to come over . &nbsp; LEWIS ( feeling the upper limb carefully and offering the bow to ED to feel ) You 're losing glass . ED feels bow , though not carefully . &nbsp; EDIt 'll hold up , I think . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 'll hold up for that much . LEWIS shrugs . &nbsp; LEWISThat 's it , then . I guess . &nbsp; ED ( as though he 's having trouble getting away from his family , and wants to have done with the leaving process ) Let 's get on with it , Lew . The sun 's coming up . Up north the water 's running .  --  16  --  &nbsp; LEWIS ( smiling crazily and conspiratorially ) You sound like me ! &nbsp; ED ( somewhat wryly ) Yeah . How about that ! ED turns and waves to MARTHA and DEAN , as they stand in the door , drawn together as if to protect each other . He gets in the car , LEWIS starts it , and they disappear down the driveway . We then show several shots of the canoe-laden station wagon as it moves up the quiet suburban street . Cut to Brief shot of interior of car , and LEWIS . &nbsp; LEWIS ( somewhat oratorically , but with the understanding that it is admittedly phony oratory ) Out of the sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! More shots of car moving through other neighborhoods , past local stores , filling stations , and so on . Then they begin to go downhill . Ahead of them is an enormous shopping plaza , and running beside it is a big four-lane highway full of trucks going in one direction and suburban cars going in the other direction , toward the city . I will leave to the director as to how much time and footage we spend on the following shots , and as to how we do them . What happens , told very briefly , is that , sure enough , DREW 's car is at the appointed place , and roped to the top of it is a green wooden canoe , held in place on the car in a way that is obviously not awfully secure : a slipshod job and a dubious-looking canoe , indeed . ED looks at it and turns questioningly to LEWIS , but LEWIS is already concentrating on gunning past the other car , in showing the way . As LEWIS 'S car passes the other one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flash of BOBBY holding up his middle finger . Someone in the other car shouts something , but we ca n't catch it . We follow the cars onto the highway , moving fairly close together with their canoes , passing trucks , moving past drive-ins . Homes of the Whopper , motels , and so on : the commercial buildup around any big city . In successive shots we should see this heavy concentration of buildings , drive-in movies , and so on ,  --  17  --  thin out . Finally , they pass an enormous drive-in movie . The gates are open , and we get a short but very full look at the gray , blank screen , like a steep , unscalable cliff , before we go by . Cut to Shot of interior of car . LEWIS is driving confidently and pretty fast , and ED is shifting around , trying to go to sleep . He is obviously uncomfortable , but finally he finds an easy position , and leans his head back on the seat . Meanwhile , the motels and other establishments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have a sense of some time passing , or having passed . Cut to View as ED would have it , through hazed-over , half-asleep eyes . The way this is done is left to the director and to the cameraman . The effect , though , should be this : through his half-sleeping , half-waking state of mind , the audience should , even though ED is not , be aware that they are now in the rural South . The reason we know this is that , instead of motels and shopping centers and big commercial billboards , we see barns , fields , Clabber Girl signs and laxative posters and little crosses that say Jesus Saves and Prepare to Meet Thy God . The cars are now on a two-lane , local-looking highway . They come to a small town , stop the cars . All four men enter a small , small-town restaurant . They sit and order , and are served by a waitress chewing a toothpick . Various shots of them eating what is obviously unfamiliar food : biscuits and preserves and grits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly DREW , who is obviously more receptive to unfamiliar ways than the others are . BOBBY may pass a slighting remark about the waitress at a time when she may not even be out of earshot . &nbsp; BOBBYHold me back , men ! In this scene , which should be relatively short , we should be aware of a certain uneasiness or even a slight hostility on the part of the few townspeople in the cafe . Not so much hostility , of course , as in the similar scene in Easy Rider , but a definite current of it , nonetheless . People keep looking at LEWIS and the others , and occasionally someone at another table says something inaudible , and there is laughter .  --  18  --  ED looks around once , toward the end of the meal , not apprehensively , but definitely ill at ease . But they eat well , even so , and if possible we should indicate that such coarse , basic food is very good , after their bland diet of TV dinners and other such . In other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it may very well turn out to be as restful and " pattern-breaking " as LEWIS has insisted they would . They finish , get up , wait for a moment in line at the counter to pay the check , fumble for the money , decide who 's to pay for what , pay , and go out , into the fast-rising and heating-up sun . ED yawns . They climb stiffly and slowly back into the cars , and it is shown , after they get going , that ED goes almost immediately back to sleep . Our device here , with ED alternately sleeping , dozing , and waking , is to indicate the transition from one place to another on the journey , and it should be made clear that they are moving toward more and more primitive peoples , wilder scenes . They are now beginning to twist and turn , not abruptly but steadily , among the foothills of a mountain range . We see , through the windshield of the car , that a low , solid mass of blue , rugged mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher . As we see this as ED does , we pick up LEWIS 'S voice in the middle of a sentence . &nbsp; LEWIS ... bad roads into this part of the mountains , but my God Almighty , the little part of the river I 've seen would knock your eyes right smack out . It 's not an easy place to get to , but that 's what makes it good . We 'll start out at Oree , which is on a kind of bluff . Most likely we 'll have to get on the other side of it to put in . We now see the range of mountains much closer . The car is more obviously climbing , and the turns and twists are more abrupt . The mountains seem to shift from one side to the other before the car , and little by little we are coming so close to them that it appears that they are going to fall right on top of us . This is sinister but exciting , and on his increasing noticing of this , ED wakes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19  --  &nbsp; LEWISThese mountains . The whole thing 's different . I mean the whole way of taking life and the terms you take it on . &nbsp; EDWhat should I know about that ? &nbsp; LEWISThe trouble is , that you not only do n't know anything about it , you do n't want to know anything about it . &nbsp; EDWhy should I ? &nbsp; LEWISBecause , for the Lord 's sake , there may be something important in the hills . More important than what we 've got in town , anyway . &nbsp; EDOh , I do n't care anything about all that , Lewis . You ought to know that by now . I 'm a get-through-the-day man . I 'm not a great art director . I 'm not a great archer . I like the way I live well enough . &nbsp; LEWIS ( confidently ) We 'll see . ( he pats the dashboard as though it represented all manmade things ) You 've had all that office furniture in front of you , all these years : desks and bookcases and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a chair that wo n't move . But when that river is under you , all that is going to change . There 's nothing you do as vice president of Emerson-Gentry that 's going to make any difference at all , when the water starts to foam up . Then , it 's not going to be what your title says you do , but what you end up doing . You know : doing . &nbsp; ED ( as he wakes up even more fully , turning toward LEWIS ) OK , I suppose . &nbsp; LEWISI know . You think I 'm some kind of narcissistic fanatic . But I 'm not . &nbsp; ED ( but without entire conviction ) I would n't put it that way , exactly . &nbsp; LEWIS ( as though making a profound revelation : something he 's thought and thought about ) I just believe that the whole thing is going to be reduced to the human body , once and for all . I want to be ready . &nbsp; EDWhat whole thing ? &nbsp; LEWISThe human race thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to fail , the political systems are going to fail , and a few men are going to take to the hills and start over .  --  20  --  &nbsp; ED ( looking at LEWIS squarely , and with a certain amount of amazement ) Is that why you spend all that time lifting weights ? Is that why you run five miles a day ? Is that why you shoot five hundred arrows a week , and why you 've learned outdoor cooking and camping and trout fishing , and all the rest of it ? Is that why we 're going up in the mountains , right how ? &nbsp; LEWIS ( nodding ) That 's the main reason I 'm going up in the mountains right now . I 'll tell you . &nbsp; EDTell me . &nbsp; LEWISI had an air-raid shelter built . I 'll take you down there sometime . We 've got double doors and stocks of bouillon and bully beef for a couple of years at least . We 've got games for the kids , and a record player and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get up a family recorder group . But I went down there one day and sat for a while . I decided that survival was not in the rivets and the metal , and not in the double-sealed doors and not in the marbles of Chinese checkers . It was in me . It came down to the man , and what he could do . The body is the one thing you ca n't fake ; it 's just got to be there . When I realized that , I knew what I had to do . I bought the weights , and started learning how to do things . And I started going to the woods , getting a sense of them , learning them . That was eight years ago . And I 've never been sorry . &nbsp; ED ( with the petulance of slight jealousy ) Suppose there was a lot of fallout , and there was no way to breathe ? I mean , suppose the radiation did n't have any respect for your physique ? &nbsp; LEWISIn that case , buddy , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it comes to a situation where I can operate , I do n't want to crap out . You know me pretty well , Ed . &nbsp; EDI thought I did . &nbsp; LEWISYou know I 'd go up in those hills , and I believe I 'd make out where many another would n't . &nbsp; EDYou 're ready , are you ? &nbsp; LEWISI think I am . I surely do . At times I get the feeling that I ca n't wait . Life is so fucked-up now , and so complicated , that I would n't mind if it came down , right quick , to the bare survival of who was  --  21  --  ready to survive . To whoever had the guts and the brains . &nbsp; EDAnd the body . &nbsp; LEWISRight . There 's no other way . &nbsp; EDWell , maybe you 've got it figured , Lewis . I do n't know . &nbsp; LEWISYou might say I 've got the survival craze , the real bug . And to tell the truth , I do n't think most other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go through some short hysterical violence or other , but I think most of them would n't be too unhappy to give up and get it over with . ED does n't say anything in response to this , though evidently he almost does , and thinks better of it . &nbsp; LEWISWhere would you go ? &nbsp; EDWhat do you mean ? &nbsp; LEWISWhere would you go when the radios died ? When there was nobody to tell you where to go ? &nbsp; EDI 'm not sure . Probably I 'd head south , where the climate would be better . I guess I 'd try to beat my way down to the Florida coast , where there 'd be some fish still left , maybe . If it came to real gut survival , I think I 'd make out better fishing than hunting . &nbsp; LEWIS ( pointing ahead , up through the windshield toward the mountains ) That 's where I 'd go . Right where we 're going . You could make something up there . You could make something , and not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make ? &nbsp; LEWISIf everything was n't dead , you could make a kind of life that was n't out of touch with everything , with the other forms of life . Where the seasons would mean something , would mean everything . Where you could hunt and fish as you needed to , and maybe do a little light farming , and get along . You 'd die early , and your children would suffer , but you 'd be in touch . &nbsp; EDOh , I do n't know . If you wanted to , Lewis , you could go up in the hills and live right now . You could have all those same conditions . You could hunt .  --  22  --  You could farm . You could suffer just as much now as if they dropped the H-bomb . You could even start a colony . &nbsp; LEWISIt 's not the same . Do n't you see ? It would just be eccentric . Survival depends  --  well , it depends on having to survive . The kind of life I 'm talking about depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . &nbsp; ED ( with bewilderment and conviction ) I hope you do n't get it . It 's too big a price to pay . &nbsp; LEWISNo price is too big . There is silence between them now , as LEWIS concentrates on driving , and ED ponders what they have been talking about . Finally ED speaks , and it should be obvious that he wants to steer LEWIS away from LEWIS 's obsessive conversation about survival , atomic holocausts , and the like , into something more immediate . &nbsp; ED ( gestures toward mountains ) What 's the life like up there , now ? I mean , before you set up the post-H-bomb Kingdom Come ? &nbsp; LEWIS ( smiling indulgently ) Probably not too much different from what it 's liable to be then . Some hunting and a lot of screwing and a little farming . Some whiskey-making . There 's lot of music , it 's practically coming out of the trees . Everybody plays something : the guitar , the banjo , the autoharp , the spoons , the dulcimer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear some of that stuff while we 're up here . These are good people , Ed . But they 're awfully clannish , they 're set in their ways . They 'll do what they want to do , no matter what . Every family I 've ever met up here has at least one relative in the penitentiary . Some of them are in for making liquor or running it , but most of them are in for murder . They do n't think a whole lot about killing people up here . They really do n't . But they 'll generally leave you alone if you do n't bother them . And if one of ' em likes you he 'll do anything in the world for you . Up here , people live with reality . And that matters . You ca n't tell me it does n't . &nbsp; EDI 'm not as sure about that as you are . Reality is pretty rough . Men have been trying to get away from it since the age of the caves . &nbsp; LEWISThat 's their mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll see . The basic things are the big  --  23  --  things . Every time I come up here , I believe it more . You know , with all the so-called modern conveniences , a man can still fall down . His leg will break . He can lie in the woods with night coming on , knowing he 's got two cars in the garage , one of them an XK-E , a wife and three children watching the Ed Sullivan Show as he lies there trying to get his breath under a bush . The old human body is the same as it always was . It still feels that old fear , and it still feels that old pain . ED shrugs , tries to relax again and does n't succeed . Cut to Section Details SHOT OF CAR Shot of car , then , following it , other car . They are passing a highway sign that says OREE -- 40 MILES . Various shots now of steeper climbing in cars . They are among trees , lots of them , thicker and thicker along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have yet been on : really old , thirtyish state-farm-road construction , unkempt and deserted . Cut to Interior of car once more and LEWIS . &nbsp; LEWISYou look at these trees . I 've been up here in April when you could see the most amazing thing about them . &nbsp; EDTell the truth , they look pretty amazing right now . What do you mean ? &nbsp; LEWISHave you ever heard of the larvae of the linden moth ? &nbsp; EDNo , actually . &nbsp; LEWISEvery year when they 're ambitious you can look at the trees and see something happening . &nbsp; EDWhat ? &nbsp; LEWISYou can see a mass hanging . It 's like they were being lynched by the woods , by the trees . &nbsp; EDIs this another put-on ? &nbsp; LEWISNo , buddy . They 're these little worms , like caterpillars . They let themselves down on threads . You can look anywhere you like and see ' em , wringing and twisting on the ends of threads like men that  --  24  --  ca n't die . And everything is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . They 're right there , twisting . ( LEWIS relaxes , ending the story with practical rather than symbolic considerations ) But they 're bad news . They eat the hardwood leaves . The government 's trying to figure some way to get rid of them . We should then pull back into a view of what the cars are going through , the kind of country . There should be a sensation of warmth , maybe a shade more of this than is comfortable , and things should glare unexpectedly at the car : a sign advertising a laxative , a beer can by the highway , something unspecified in a field . We should show the cars , with their canoes quite obviously out of place , passing through a couple of small towns , the last smaller and country-er than the first . The woods are now heavy , much heavier than before . &nbsp; LEWISLook for deer . Sometimes they come down to the cornfields and along the roads . A shot of ED looking indulgently for deer and not seeing any . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every now and then , as the car goes past , there should be an indication , in the brush and trees , that they -- or we -- might have seen something if we 'd looked hard enough , or in the right place . Long shot as the cars pull into Oree . It is a disheartening place , a typical remote small southern town . The woods and weed fields seem to grow right up to the edge of it . There are no Negroes in evidence , for this is in the hills , and there is no precedent . We see the town hall , the fire engine being washed near it , a couple of gas stations . Close in as LEWIS 's car and the other pull in to a Texaco station and stop . Cut to Interior of car , as LEWIS pulls to a stop and kills the engine . LEWIS relaxes , alert but waiting for what will come . For a moment nothing happens . Then an OLD MAN appears at the window of the car at LEWIS 's side , leaning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caricature , with an absurdly cocked straw hat and trembling hands . Neither LEWIS nor ED knows quite what to do with him .  --  25  --  &nbsp; LEWISLook . Let me ask you something . OLD MAN nods , but does n't reply . &nbsp; LEWISCan you find us somebody to drive these two cars down to Aintry ? &nbsp; OLD MANWhat you talking about ? &nbsp; LEWIS ( a little impatiently ) We need three men and one extra car . Two to drive these two cars down to Aintry , and another car to bring the drivers back up here . A scene now where everybody -- all the city men -- gets out of the cars and kind of converges on the OLD MAN . He looks bewildered and a little threatened , as he turns from one to the other . There is an especial emphasis on his trembling hands . Cut to Shot of ED , looking off into the woods surrounding town , evidently for help of some kind , but none comes . &nbsp; BOBBYMan , I like the way you wear that hat ! OLD MAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on in exactly the same way . &nbsp; OLD MAN ( turning explicitly to BOBBY ) You do n't know nothin ' . DREW steps forward , an awkward , considerate person . He says slowly , with evident concern for the humanity of the OLD MAN : I wonder if you could tell us something about the land around here ? The OLD MAN stops looking at the others , and turns to DREW , giving him his attention . &nbsp; DREWI mean , suppose we wanted to get down the river to Aintry . Could we do it ? &nbsp; OLD MANWell , you done come over the bridge . What does it look like to you ? &nbsp; DREWI could n't tell . It looks like a nice river to me . &nbsp; OLD MANIt 's right rocky , on down a piece . The river goes up and down , cordin ' to whether it rains or not . They say there 's a big gorge on down south , but I ai n't never been there .  --  26  --  &nbsp; DREWDo you think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? &nbsp; DREW ( gesturing to two canoes on cars ) In these two canoes . &nbsp; OLD MAN ( slowly , but with as much deliberation as is available to him ) I would n't want to try it . If it rains , you 're liable to be in bad trouble . The water climbs them rock walls like a monkey . Cut to LEWIS . &nbsp; LEWIS ( with an impatience of a kind that is unknown to the OLD MAN ) What the hell ! It 's not going to rain . Look up yonder . ED looks at the sky , which , sure enough , is bright blue , with no sign of any kind of rain , and hardly a cloud . &nbsp; LEWISIf it rains , we 'll just find us a place and hole up . &nbsp; OLD MANYou 'll have a time holing up if you get down in that gorge . &nbsp; LEWISWe 'll make out . &nbsp; OLD MANAll right . You asked me . I told you . There is an instant of uncertain milling about in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the OLD MAN , move confusedly around the cars , and then the OLD MAN chances to look in the rear window of DREW 's car . &nbsp; OLD MANWhose guitar is that-there yonder ? The OLD MAN , without any further ceremony , is jumping back toward the filling station , saying &nbsp; OLD MANLonnie ! Come on out ' chere ! He comes back , signaling someone from the interior of the filling station . Two shot of OLD MAN and LONNIE coming forth from the depths of the Texaco station , the latter reluctantly , shyly , bringing with him a battered five-string banjo.  --  27  --  &nbsp; OLD MAN ( speaking to any and all of the city men ) Come on ! Play us a little somethin ' ! In close on the face of LONNIE , who is revealed as an albino boy , most probably a half-wit , as back-country as they come , likely from a family or community inbred to the point of imbecility and albinism . He has a sweet , expectant smile . Cut to Shot of city men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is grinning with pleasure and anticipation . DREW rolls down the rear window of the rear car and gets out his guitar . Cut to Section Details SHOT OF LONNIE Shot of LONNIE , holding his banjo as if at port arms , or in some other kind of semi-alerted posture . His cross-eyes are evident , and rather endearing . He is innocent and ready . Longer shot of whole filling station , dusty and in a forgotten place on the map , where all this is happening . DREW is getting up on the hood of the car , and LONNIE moves nearer to him , as though instinctively sensing a comrade or brother .  --  28  --  DREW tunes his guitar for a minute , getting his finger-picks set as he wants them . &nbsp; DREW ( gently , and with infinite sympathy to LONNIE ) What 're we going to play , Lonnie ? &nbsp; OLD MANAnything ! Play anything ! DREW looks around , not quite sure as to whether or not he is going to contribute to a painful situation . Then he makes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sits on the car hood , and very carefully picks three notes in the key of C. These are the first notes of a piece called " Duelling Banjoes , " as recorded by Mike Russo and Ron Brentano in Portland , Oregon , in 1964 . The piece is one in which guitar and banjo " answer " each other by playing the same phrases alternately . &nbsp; OLD MANGo ahead ! Go on ! Cut to Shot of LONNIE seriously adjusting primitive capo to get the banjo into the same key with DREW . Shot of OLD MAN explaining : &nbsp; OLD MANLonnie do n't know nothing but banjo-pickin ' . He ai n't never been to school . When he was little he used to sit out in the yard and beat on a lard-can with a stick . Cut back to DREW , as he gets into the piece , figuring , as one would suppose , that he will go ahead and play the piece whether LONNIE joins him or not . He finishes the sequence of chords that comprise the piece , and starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . For every phrase he plays , there is an echo . He does not look up from the guitar keyboard , but his face and his attitude change , first to gratified unbelief , and then to full conviction . The banjo comes on stronger . The music begins really to sound good : to sound driving and confident and gutsy : to sound meant . Cut to Longer shot which includes whole group in the dusty , forgotten or never-discovered filling station , way  --  29  --  off up in the mountains of Appalachia , full of afternoon sunlight , dirt , and music . Cut to DREW , who is smiling and playing like mad . In close on DREW 's hands , which are alternately finger-picking and flat-picking with the thumb . Cut to Scratched , scarred hands of LONNIE , which are moving with beautiful and thoroughly musical economy . Cut to LONNIE 's face , which is a cross-eyed , beatific vision of the idiot doing what he loves . Cut to Face of DREW , which has the same look , and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated and unexpected pleasure : pure joy . They play one more chorus , the loudest and best of all , and during this DREW moves down off the car to LONNIE 's side , and they stand together , finishing a very good collaboration . They do n't look at each other ; they do n't need to . DREW makes a complicated run , and they end the piece . &nbsp; DREWGoddamn ! &nbsp; LEWISCome on , Drew ! Put that thing away . We 've got to get water under us ! &nbsp; DREWListen : I could play with this guy all day ! Can you wait just a minute ? I 'd like to get his name and address . DREW turns to LONNIE , and then to the OLD MAN . The three of them walk away from the others , a little out of earshot , and stand talking . DREW passes his guitar to the OLD MAN , and is evidently writing down something the OLD MAN is telling him . LONNIE and the OLD MAN go back into the filling station , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DREWYou know , I 'd like to come back up here , just to hear some more music . I thought all the real country pickers had long since gone to Nashville .  --  30  --  &nbsp; LEWIS ( all business ) How about the river ? &nbsp; DREWHe tells me you ca n't get down to the river anywhere in town here . It 's too steep . But eight or ten miles north the land 's flat . We might be able to find us a road through the woods . There was a logging operation up there a few years back , and he thinks there are still some roads that go down to the river , or somewhere around it . &nbsp; LEWISWhat about drivers ? &nbsp; DREWHe does n't have anybody here , but there are a couple of brothers out north of town who own a garage . They might be able to do it . Longer shot of the four city men getting back into their cars and starting up . Shot of them moving along through the little town , in such enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they left only a few hours ago . They go over a bridge , a wooden bridge set in newly-painted silver-steel girders . Cut to ED leaning out of window of car , looking curiously at the river . The river seems placid and narrow , undistinguished , rather uninteresting . &nbsp; ED ( pointing down ) That it ? &nbsp; LEWIS ( nodding ) That 's it . They are now almost back in the country . LEWIS stops the car and DREW 's car pulls up alongside . &nbsp; LEWISGo find a store and pick up some more supplies . See if you can get three or four six-packs of beer . Meet us over there as soon as you get through . LEWIS points , and the camera swings to show what he is pointing at : a dilapidated garage with a house attached to it , or sort of attached . On the corrugated metal of the garage is written : GRINER BROTHERS GARAGE . We focus now on LEWIS 's car , as it moves to the Griner Garage . Shot of LEWIS knocking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a brief look through the door , which is into a depressing country house with a picture  --  31  --  of Jesus , a few beer cans on the floor . Around a jamb comes a dog 's head , as we Cut back to LEWIS and ED . We now become aware of a muffled hammering nearby . &nbsp; LEWIS ( pointing toward garage ) Sounds like he 's in there . They move to front door of garage , but it is padlocked . LEWIS leads way around garage , which is bordered by depressing rusty farm implements , inner tubes , twisted parts of cars and engines , and the like . At the rear of the garage they find a door which is sort of sagging open . The sound of metal on metal is much louder now , as it comes through the opening . Without any hesitation at all , LEWIS plunges into the darkness of the garage . He is gone before ED makes up his mind to follow him , but he does , and goes in . For a moment we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garage , and hear the sound of metal being pounded . Cut to pp . NA-14 &nbsp; pp. 32-49 INTERIOR OF GARAGE Interior of garage . We can hardly pick out anything at all , but soon we begin to be able to distinguish things , and the camera to show them mysteriously to us : a green truck battery , cables and wires , a distributor and a carburetor on a wooden bench , an anvil , an engine hoisted and dangling on a heavy , greasy chain . Through all these things LEWIS and ED thread their way , and before them is disclosed a huge , country figure , a kind of red-neck Thor , pounding the rim of a truck wheel laid on its side on a bench . Just as this is established , and we see the figure in its half-light , an exclamation comes from it : &nbsp; GRINERShit fire ! God Almighty ! GRINER 's figure bends , apparently injured , doubles up , and makes for the door . We see the three figures in an odd relation , and I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is done , but , through what may be either a trick of the dim light or a deliberate action on the part of LEWIS , it should appear that LEWIS makes a temporary effort to block the way of GRINER . This is only a momentary effect ,  --  32  --  but it should be definite , and baffling . Then GRINER goes out through the door . Cut to Shot of GRINER standing in yard , spraddle-legged , holding his hurt hand . He looks up at LEWIS and ED , and it is impossible to tell as to whether the intense , terrible fierceness in his face is coming from his pain , or from their intrusion . Probably it is from both , but we ca n't know that . He is an enormous , country-brutal-looking man , with no humor in him . He suggests nothing but brutality and stupidity . And enormous physical power . He is dressed in overall pants and a sleeveless undershirt , and also has on a train engineer 's cap and army boots , which are unlaced . LEWIS walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? &nbsp; GRINER ( as though this were a perfectly logical question he rejects ) Naw . It ai n't as bad as I thought . GRINER pulls out a dirty handkerchief and wraps it around his hand . &nbsp; GRINERWhut you want ? &nbsp; LEWISCould you and somebody else , maybe your brother , drive a couple of cars down to Aintry for us ? We could give you twenty dollars for it . Or if you wanted to get a third fellow to drive another car , so you 'd have a way to get back up here , we 'd give you thirty . &nbsp; GRINERDrive ' em down there for whut ? &nbsp; LEWISWe want to take a canoe trip down the Cahula-wassee , and we 'd like for our cars to be at Aintry when we get there day after tomorrow . &nbsp; GRINERA canoe trip ? &nbsp; LEWISThat 's right . A canoe trip . &nbsp; GRINERWhat the hail you want to fuck around with that river for ? &nbsp; LEWIS ( firmly ) Because it 's there . &nbsp; GRINERIt 's there , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ git out , you 're gon na wish it wudn't.  --  33  --  &nbsp; EDListen , Lewis . To hell with it . Let 's go back to town and play golf . LEWIS pays no attention to ED . &nbsp; LEWIS ( to GRINER ) Well , can you do it ? &nbsp; GRINERHow much did you say ? &nbsp; LEWISTwenty dollars for two men , thirty for three . &nbsp; GRINERFifty for three . &nbsp; LEWIS ( calmly and deliberately , and very distinctly ) Fifty , my ass . LEWIS moves directly up to GRINER in what is quite obviously a challenge to GRINER to do something physical , if he 's of a mind to . ED pulls at LEWIS 's arm , saying &nbsp; EDLewis . Lewis . For God 's sake . &nbsp; GRINERHow about forty ? &nbsp; LEWIS ( turning finally to ED ) Are you good for ten ? ED takes the money from the leg pocket of his flying suit and gives it to Lewis . &nbsp; LEWIS ( to GRINER ) Twenty now , and we 'll send you the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . If we 're good for twenty we 're good for forty . Take it or leave it . &nbsp; GRINERGood enough . GRINER takes the bills and stuffs them in his pocket . He goes into the rear of the house . Two shot of LEWIS and ED , as ED says , as they move back to the car . &nbsp; EDYou reckon we 'll ever see these cars again ? This is a rough son of a bitch . Why would n't he and his brother just go off and sell them ? &nbsp; LEWISSimple . Because we know who he is . And he wants to make the money . So do n't worry about it . The cars ' 11 be right there when we get to Aintry.  --  34  --  LEWIS and ED sit in the car talking , with the door open on ED 's side . GRINER and his equally large brother come out of the house . Shot which includes all this , and also includes DREW 's car pulling up and stopping . All the city men get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , but it is evident that LEWIS is briefing DREW and BOBBY on what has happened , and on what is now going to happen . The reason we ca n't hear the conversation is that we have drawn back from all this , and the sound of insects has become so loud that it is all we can hear . The effect is that of a kind of decadent pastoral : a scene in the country which is dominated by mean people and the off-scourings of industrialism : axles , tires , bent harrows and tin cans , all in the grass , with the insects singing about them as the men talk . We come in closer on the group , and it breaks up rapidly . The first actual voice we hear above the insect hum is LEWIS , saying &nbsp; LEWISLet 's go ! Let 's git ' em ! Shot which shows the city men getting into their cars . Swing camera to show GRINER brothers getting into a very run-down pickup truck , and for the first time we notice , quite definitely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is a third man with them . There is just a momentary impression of him  --  perhaps a figure in a baseball cap  --  and that is all . Shot of interior of LEWIS 's car . &nbsp; EDBetter let them show us . &nbsp; LEWIS ( scornfully ) Hell , we know ' bout where it is . All we 've got to do is go north , and when the land flattens out , take any road that goes to the left . Nothing hard about it . The river 's got to be in there somewhere . There 's not any other place it can be . Longer shot of cars starting up . LEWIS 's car takes off fast , almost like a racing start . We see , then , that DREW waits for the truck to pull in front of his car , so that he can follow it . Various shots , now , of the three cars turning off onto one dirt road after another , each worse than the last . Shots of LEWIS driving confidently and aggressively , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying  --  35  --  not to look apprehensively around or at LEWIS , but not quite succeeding . Shot through the windshield of the car , which is just enough of a view to suggest that a very small dirt road may be going off to the left . LEWIS slows the car around , onto this . We are in close now on just the one car , as LEWIS bumps and bangs down into a kind of hollow where the road gives out . Nothing is there but the rock chimney of a burned-down house . A quick shot of a lizard moving across the chimney stone . &nbsp; LEWISWell , we screwed up , sure enough . &nbsp; EDWhy not just let them show us where the river is ? &nbsp; LEWISWe 'll see . Shot of car bumping and clawing back up to the other two cars . LEWIS pulls up beside the truck . GRINER leans out of the cab . &nbsp; GRINERWhere you goin ' , city boy ? &nbsp; LEWISWe 'll get there . Let 's get on with it . &nbsp; GRINERGo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the state . ED hides a kind of smile . LEWIS spurts forward again , the canoe rattling and banging on the roof . The cars are now on flat land , and we see them running between stumps of pine trees , some of which have been cut down with axes and some , evidently , with power saws . LEWIS gestures at stumps . &nbsp; LEWISLand 's been sawmilled . I figure we 're getting there . Shots to show that the road is getting worse and worse . Finally they come to place where the road goes down a very steep incline , almost as steep , from the looks of it , as the first dip of a roller coaster . Without hesitation LEWIS tips the nose of the car over the embankment and starts down .  --  36  --  Shot of ED 's face as he expresses severe apprehension , bracing against the dashboard . Bushes swish at the open windows of the car , some of them coming in and going back out . There is a heavy sound of brush and weeds dragging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ED as he fights off limbs and bush branches . Then suddenly he is not fighting them ; one limb , with a few big green leaves on it , stays across his chest , and we see , very briefly , that the leaves are pulsing with ED 's heartbeat . They have stopped . We are still on ED , as LEWIS 's voice comes from offscreen . &nbsp; LEWIS ( imperatively ) Listen ! They sit very quietly , and we are aware , in exactly the same way in which the audience in the theatre was aware before the film ever began , before the film credits appeared , of this sound that might be the sound of running water . As in the prefilm sequence , we gradually increase the sound until it is almost a dead certainty that it is running water . LEWIS , listening , grins , and his grin increases as the sound of water increases , as though the two things were in tune . &nbsp; LEWISLet 's go ! They get out , LEWIS leaping , and ED rather apprehensively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? &nbsp; LEWISPlenty . Watch where you put your feet . And yet , as they stand there in the woods , they look as though they belong there , not only LEWIS but ED as well . ED catches a glimpse of himself in the rear window of the station wagon , where the dark equipment inside makes the window more like a mirror , and winks at himself as he buckles on his army web belt with the big knife on it and the coil of green nylon rope . He pulls a wry face at himself which is meant to be self-mocking , as though he were putting himself on by acting this way , wearing these clothes , being here in the woods , but he 's also a little impressed , despite everything . This is , in other words , different . So is he . ED looks around for LEWIS , and does n't find him . He looks in this direction , then that . Finally he sees  --  37  --  LEWIS on top of a high bank in front of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ED scrambling clumsily up the bank . When he gets to the top , LEWIS has already gone down the other side . ED follows , slipping and sliding in leaf mold . When he gets to the bottom , he sees that the ground is wet . Squeamishly , as though afraid of getting his tennis shoes dirty , he crow-hops , dodging the pools of water , over to where LEWIS is peering at something through a drapery of bushes and willows . ED comes up to LEWIS , and LEWIS opens the willows wider , and we use the camera to see what ED is seeing as a result . We should move the camera forward so that the river is framed by the willow leaves , making a stylized and even pretty " composition " of this view of the river . We look at it without dialogue for a minute , the only sound the sound of the water . The effect this should have on the audience is the same as it has on ED : the river is pretty -- beautiful even --  but not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is green and clean , and not threatful at all . One can imagine ED looking at it and thinking to himself that the trip is going to be restful and enjoyable , as LEWIS has maintained all along . He is reassured and even a little eager . &nbsp; EDPretty . Pretty indeed . The willows swish back into place , closing off the view of the stream . Cut to Section Details SHOT OF CARS Shot of cars , the unloading of the canoes , the carrying-out of supplies , the whole sequence of getting the canoes over the embankment and so on . I will leave how this is done to the director , but the effect , with a good many shots of the city men sweating and straining , should be with the unfamiliar effort of doing these things . While the city men are working to move their stuff to the river , we get a few glimpses of the GRINER brothers and their companion , whose face we never see clearly , lounging around against their truck , talking inaudibly but , apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no one asks them . Cut to River , where the canoes are being loaded . ED is down in the water , streaked with mud and slime from the bank , trying his best to get the equipment workably  --  38  --  into the canoes . He keeps shifting things around , slipping , getting resolutely up and trying again , as BOBBY hands objects down to him from the bank . Finally DREW appears with his guitar , and hands it gingerly down to ED . &nbsp; ED ( as he takes it ) I hope we do n't ruin it by spilling our foolish asses in this crazy river . &nbsp; DREW ( imitating the country talk in an exaggerated way ) I do n't know about you , but I ai n't planning to spill in this-yere river . I 'm a-goin ' with you , and not with Mr. Lewis Medlock . I done seen how he drove these roads he do n't know nothin ' about . Finally LEWIS appears -- materializes rather -- on the bank beside BOBBY and DREW . &nbsp; LEWISOK . We 're ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car starting . &nbsp; BOBBYI 'll bet they ca n't get the cars back up that hill . &nbsp; DREWThat 's a nice thought . What if they ca n't ? &nbsp; BOBBYWhat the hell are we going to do if we come off this river and there 're no cars , down at what's-its-name ? &nbsp; LEWISThey 'll be there . Do n't worry about a thing . LEWIS hands out life jackets from the bank , and we see , in various shots , the other three getting clumsily into them , buckling them , and so on . Shot of ED holding green wooden canoe for BOBBY to get into it . BOBBY finally makes it into the bow seat and sits there , slowly picking up a paddle . Now LEWIS gets in , easily and confidently . &nbsp; LEWISAll set . Turn loose . BOBBY still sits , holding the paddle uncertainly , while LEWIS with long sweeps moves the canoe out to the middle of the stream . Now DREW gets into the bow of the aluminum canoe as ED holds it steady . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He makes a practice stroke through the air .  --  39  --  &nbsp; DREWThis how you hold this thing ? &nbsp; ED ( struggling to get loose from the bank slime ) You hold it ... like you hold it . Finally , with a great deal of trouble , ED gets in and picks up the paddle . The canoe is already swinging broadside to the stream , and he makes efforts to get the bow downriver . The camera should now be in the aluminum canoe , and we should try very hard to render the effect of the stream 's taking hold of the canoe and the men -- taking them over , as it were -- and of the strangeness and consequent excitement of this . It is very quiet . All we can hear is the water , and we , like the occupants of the canoe , miss without knowing it the sound of engines , of motored vehicles . Various shots of ED and DREW getting used to the canoe , of them shifting the paddles from one side to the other , and other small adjustments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canoe going through a place where the water quickens a little , and the speed of the canoe visibly picks up . So . far ED and DREW are doing all right , and they begin to know it . We should see that  --  40  --  they are getting a rudimentary sense of what they need to do . &nbsp; EDGo ahead and try a little stronger pull . I think we 're getting the hang of it . We now see a broader expanse of the river in front of them , barely noticing the other canoe , which is just in there somewhere . It is obvious that the river is not particularly rough here , but the part before them is a little rougher than at the place where they put in . We now have various shots of ED and DREW manuevering through some lively , interesting but not dangerous water , none of it white , but lively and vigorous . Then they run one little stretch that is very slightly dangerous , where the water begins to foam up , and they make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backward as much as he is able to do . &nbsp; DREWHey , hey ! How about this ! &nbsp; ED ( pleased ) This is some kind of all right , huh ? They go along , in calmer water now . Shot of ED , ploughing easily along , enjoying things . DREW 's voice offscreen . &nbsp; DREW ( to ED or to himself ) Well , for God 's sake ! ( evidently to the other canoe ) What 's wrong up there , Tarzan ? We now use the camera to crane from one side of the canoe to the other , as ED would have to do to see past DREW , and we are finally able to make out the other canoe and see that it is swung broadside to the current , that the action of the men in it is confused and even a little desperate , and that now the canoe is turned all the way around , and is traveling downstream backward . DREW turns around , again only so much as he is able to in his position , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more concerned about the others , but he smiles , too , and shakes his head ruefully , as though he expected this .  --  41  --  Cut to Shot of the green canoe , as LEWIS tries to bring the bow around . &nbsp; LEWIS ( to BOBBY , and a little impatiently ) Let me do it ! Take your paddle out of the water and I 'll bring it around . He does n't though . Just as the bow is beginning to swing downstream , they drift onto a couple of big rocks and hang there . LEWIS hunches in his seat , trying to get the canoe off the rocks that way , does n't succeed , then steps out into the water , which comes up just a trifle above mid-thigh . The other canoe comes alongside , ED and DREW backwater , and ED gets out with LEWIS to help . &nbsp; ED ( to all of them ) Boy , that feels good . He takes some water from the river and rubs it over his face . &nbsp; EDLet 's have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water from his face , rummaging around under tent canvas and  --  42  --  other pieces of equipment , getting out four 12-ounce cans of beer and handing them around . Close shots of each of the four drinking . ED , standing in the river , seems to enjoy his the most . He drinks almost the whole can in one swallow , and the transformation from tiredness and anxiety to contentment and even a measure of enthusiasm is immediately apparent . All of them feel great : relieved , tired , and happy , ready for whatever comes next . Longer shot now which shows them in the scene through which the river runs at that point . They are evidently on a farm of some sort ; there are cows on one bank , some lying in the shade , some swishing away flies , some walking aimlessly about . It should also be apparent that the land in front of them -- that is , downriver  - -  is getting higher . Shot of LEWIS and ED shoving together to get the stuck canoe off the rocks . It clears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the canoe with DREW . Various shots of the canoes riding easily along . They go under a bridge , and we might have a shot of a couple of the townspeople -- perhaps children -- watching impassively from the bridge . They do n't wave , and the men in the canoes look up but do n't wave either . We are now moving through the part of the river lying directly under the town of Oree . It is evidently used as a kind of junk heap where the townspeople throw away anything they do n't want . Various shots of industrial junk : tires , parts of engines , wheels , old refrigerators , kitchen appliances , and so on . There are also several startlingly bright broken things of plastic : pitchers , water containers , and the like . Cut to ED looking closely , as closely as he can , at one of these : what looks to be a blue pitcher . &nbsp; DREW ( as though reading ED 's mind ) Plastic . Does n't go back to its elements . &nbsp; EDYou think that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; EDNothing . I do n't mean anything .  --  43  --  They are now past most of the town . It is getting darker . Not a lot darker but a little ; enough to be noticed . Shot of ED as he looks around more . Something is making him uneasy without his knowing what it is . The audience also should be aware that there is some change in things , perhaps in the river . ED brings his paddle out of the water , and there is a feather stuck to the end of it . In a subtle way he registers distaste , even recoils a little . ED is now peering intently at something in the river . He ca n't quite make it out , but finally he does . It is a chicken head , ludicrous and repulsive . In close on chicken head spinning aimlessly in the water beside the canoe , turning over and over , fixing ED every now and then with its open eye . Pull back to reveal the canoe -- or canoes , if desired --  riding on what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is true , but blood nonetheless . &nbsp; ED ( not able to contain his disgust ) Je-sus ! &nbsp; DREW ( turning around as well as he can , in a manner which is that of joking , but not entirely ) What 's the matter ? Do n't you like fried chicken ? &nbsp; ED ( resignedly ) I used to . We see that , gradually , the red dies out of the water . Darkness is also coming on , seeming to come up toward them from downriver . ED still gazes into the river while he paddles . Just as the water becomes more or less clear once more --  that is , clear enough to be seen into for a couple of feet -- the canoe passes over a huge ghostly white underwater thing . In close on this , as we see it through the water . It is a big rock with a log wedged against it . Both rock and log are covered with feathers , wavering , hairy , and repulsive in a sort of uncanny representation of human nausea : a perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paddling easily along , not worried about a thing ) Man , you got to get used to these things ! You 're a big boy now !  --  44  --  &nbsp; EDYou get used to ' em ! &nbsp; DREWIf you get all shook by a poultry processing plant , what 're you gon na do when you run up on a big bear , down in Mr. Lewis Medlock 's vacation paradise ? ( he points downriver ) &nbsp; EDI 'll take the bear . Shot of the canoe riding along with a lot of feathers accompanying it , sailing along at about the same speed as the canoe . They go around a turn , and the river changes completely . There is a long series of little rapids , lively and interesting-looking , stretching out of sight ahead . We see these from DREW 's position in the bow , over the beak of the canoe . &nbsp; DREW 'S VOICE , OFFSCREEN ( surprised and delighted , and a little apprehensive but not frightened ) Well for the Lord 's sake , would you look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head right for the fastest water . Try to keep us going right down the middle , through the channel and between the rocks . That 's all I know to do . &nbsp; DREWAy , ay ! Let 's go there ! DREW digs in enthusiastically , the canoe picks up speed and starts through the first of the rapids . Series of very fast action shots as DREW and ED battle with the river , trying to keep the canoe straight in the channel , trying to avoid running over rocks . We should do these shots handheld , even with something of the quality of a violent home movie . The camera should buck and pitch , sometimes lose the picture , swing and jump rapidly , catch objects and faces and hands at odd unpredictable angles . During all this , ED is silent , working hard , but now and then we hear DREW give an exhultant whoop , like a cowboy breaking a horse . We show a good deal of this , because we want to depict the potential danger of the river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these men . What emerges from this sequence is that DREW and ED are equal to coping with this stretch of the river , but only just barely . There is a time when they just about capsize . They ship some water , and DREW calls out Uh-oh ! But somehow they right the canoe and continue .  --  45  --  At the last place on this stretch , they go right over a big boulder and come down on the river with a tremendous WHUMP that ought to shake the audience ' s back teeth . We now see DREW and ED on calm water , adjusting themselves in their seats , more or less getting back to normal paddling . DREW half-turns again , and his glasses are orange with the sunset . &nbsp; DREWOld Lewis , by damn ! He knows something ! &nbsp; EDThat was some ride , eh ? &nbsp; DREWYou better believe it was some ride ! You OK ? &nbsp; EDPretty good . Yes , sir ! Sure am ! ED leans forward and gets himself another can of beer . DREW paddles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase of whistling , he sings the words to the end of the song : " ... in my birch-bark canoe ! " We look now , from DREW 's position , and see that the other canoe also has survived the rapids , and that  --  46  --  LEWIS is backwatering in order to let DREW and ED catch up . ED drives his canoe up alongside the other one with a long stroke . As he comes alongside , he makes a motion with his hand to get rid of insects around his head . &nbsp; ED ( to LEWIS ) Do n't you think we ought to make camp pretty soon ? &nbsp; LEWISYeah , I do . I 'm afraid if we go any farther the banks might begin to get too high for us to get out on . You-all look for a place on the left , and we 'll look over here . Shot of canoes as they go through another little stretch of rapids , phosphorescent in the gathering twilight , and shortly after this ED spots a place on the left bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that either he or we can see . ED points with his paddle , and he and DREW make for that spot on the bank . Various shots of two canoes being made fast to saplings , of the men getting articles of equipment from the canoes , placing these articles around at different places on the ground . Through all this , it is evident that LEWIS is supervising the operation , and the others very gladly do what he tells them to . It is now very dark , and we see LEWIS placing a couple of flashlights in a bush so as to provide an area of concentrated light . We use this device to render various effects of light and dark and mood and tone , as one after the other of the men passes through this lit-up area , stays in it for a moment , then melts back into the general dark . The upcast light of the flashlights gives unexpected qualities to the faces of these men . It makes BOBBY look vaguely Oriental and DREW more pitted-faced , as the shadow adheres to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his face . Only LEWIS is instantly recognizable , though changed somewhat , too . He looks more determined and authoritative than ever , with also an admixture of ruthlessness that does not show up so well by daylight . Finally , camp is pretty much made . LEWIS gets one of the flashlights from the bush . &nbsp; EDThe burning bush , eh ? &nbsp; LEWISYeah ; we do n't need it any more .  --  47  --  ED picks up the other flashlight and goes over to where LEWIS is standing beside the river , sliding the beam of the light up and down the current . ED does his flashlight the same way , aimlessly , because the lights do n't reveal anything but the river itself , and only a little of that . They turn inland without saying anything , and ED runs his flashlight over the camp they have made , picking out the two tents , a fire that has been laid , and ED 's bow hanging on the limb of a tree . LEWIS goes to the bow and plucks it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? &nbsp; EDSure enough . &nbsp; LEWIS ( fingering one of the broadheads ) You like these Howard Hill broadheads ? &nbsp; EDYeah . I think they 're fine . The last archery magazine I read says a two-bladed head has better penetration than a four . That 's good enough for me . BOBBY comes over to them and hands them a paper cup apiece , and then pours a big drink of bourbon for each . He disappears , and LEWIS takes a generous swallow as ED sips . Then LEWIS moves to the fire and begins to work with it . The flame starts , changing the scene once more , this time , with the unsteadiness of the light source , giving everything and everyone a wavering , flickering quality , ghostly and haunting and insubstantial . ED goes and lies on the bank by himself while LEWIS cooks . He closes his eyes and apparently is sleeping . In close on his face as it progressively relaxes . A soft guitar chord , a minor , sounds near him , unexpectedly and very welcome . ED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is in his sleep or not . Two shot of DREW sitting beside ED with the guitar . He is tuning it , using both regular tuning methods and harmonic tuning , which has a beautiful bell-like sound . ED wakes up fully and turns on his side , away from the river and toward DREW . &nbsp; DREWI 've always wanted to do this , only I did n't know it . He picks part of a very country-sounding bluegrass piece , then breaks off .  --  48  --  &nbsp; DREWIt 's woods music . Do n't you think so ? &nbsp; EDSure do . BOBBY comes over and sits with them as DREW plays . He plays a couple of short pieces , a blues , a rag , some more bluegrass , and then the excerpt from " Buckdancer 's Choice " which we used in the sound track at the very beginning of the film , before the credits appeared . BOBBY is revealed as having the bottle of bourbon with him , and he pours himself another drink and ED one . He offers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being happy with his music , and wanting nothing else , nothing to interfere with it . LEWIS brings over dishes of the food he has cooked , and the three of them eat with great relish while DREW continues to play . DREW stops , and they all sit silently . &nbsp; LEWIS ( in what is for him a soft voice ) You know , we do n't have too many more years for this kind of thing . &nbsp; EDOh , I guess not . But I can tell you , I 'm glad we came . I 'm damned glad . This is a great place to be , right now . The greatest . &nbsp; BOBBYIt 's true , Lewis . It 's all true , what you said . And I think we did real good on the river , do n't you ? I mean , for amateurs . &nbsp; LEWISGood enough , I reckon . But I 'm sure glad you and I did n't get that damned sluggish wood canoe turned around backwards just before we hit some white water . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I do n't think we 'll have to worry about that any more , do you ? &nbsp; LEWISI hope not . &nbsp; ED ( stretching and getting up ) Well , to the sleeping bags , men . &nbsp; LEWIS ( looking meditatively out over the river ) Had my first wet dream in a sleeping bag . I surely did . &nbsp; BOBBY ( with interest , but not a whole lot ) How was it ?  --  49  --  &nbsp; LEWISGreat . There 's no repeating it . Sequence of shots showing ED taking the flashlight , going to the tent , stooping to get into it , and various shots of his face and hands in the low flashlight light as he scrambles around , taking off his flying suit and struggling with the laces of his tennis shoes , that have got hard with the water . We also feel him adjusting to the unfamiliar interior of the tent , which is strange and slanted and green . Final shot of this sequence showing him getting into the sleeping bag , sound of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He snaps out the light , and we hear , out on the bank , DREW still playing , trying out some high minor . pp. 15-31 &nbsp; pp. 50-62 SHOT IN THE DARK OF ED 'S FACE Shot in the dark of ED 's face . We can not tell whether he has his eyes open or not , but he is very still . Now we dissolve in , over ED 's face , a kind of ectoplasmic dream scene of the photographing of the model for the Kitt'n Britches ad . There is no sound here ; it is as though the scene were taking place behind a veil of some sort . ED is in the studio , much as he was before . The model looks at him in the same way . THAD EMERSON , ED 's partner , is bossing people around . One of the women attendants takes the cat rather cruelly and fastens its claws in the back of the model 's panties . Then chaos erupts . We have a brief impression of the cat raking a long , livid weal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she leaps and cavorts , all honor and dignity and beauty gone , hands reach for her , ED stands with his mouth helplessly open : SOUND : a loud , resilient , sickening thump . The tent shakes , and we see ED 's eyes widen in pure terror as he gropes for the flashlight and turns it on . Brief shot of the tent  --  or perhaps both tents  --  from the outside , with the last glimmerings of the fire on them . One of the tents is shaking for some unknown reason ; the other is quite still . Cut to ED again , and we follow the beam of the flashlight as it crawls along the ceiling of the tent . Then the light stops , and we go in close on what it discloses , which is the great talon of a bird , most probably an owl .  --  50  --  A brief moment of stillness on ED 's part , as he watches the claw , and then other claws , work themselves into the fabric of the tent . ED smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slowly rises , human flesh , not bird-talon , up into the light and then up through the light , until he very lightly touches the stony claw . The bird seems to shift its weight . Close in on hand and talon , as ED , given a momentary relaxation of one of the talons , slips a finger in between it and the tent fabric . It is a kind of weird handshake . ED rocks the owl back and forth gently , and the tent top with it . Then suddenly there is a great sound , a rush , an explosion of feathers , and ED 's hand is alone at the top of the tent . He pulls back his hand , checks to see that DREW is in the other air sack , which he is , and then turns out the light and crinkles down into the air mattress again . There is a long sigh , and then no sound . Brief shot , now , of the two tents . We hold this shot awhile , even uncomfortably long , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods , and we hear the sound of the river running , on and on . Now , finally , we see ED 's face again , but this time it is apparent that the light by which we see it is not that of the flashlight , but of very early morning . He lies for a minute with his hands behind his head evidently thinking something over . Then he gets up and crawls stiffly out of the tent in his jockey shorts . He goes over to the river . Swing camera to show river , which we can barely see because of the fog that is rolling up from it . As ED stands there , more and more of the fog covers him , until we can scarcely see him . A new expression , so far as we can tell , comes over his face to signify the registration of a new and possibly good idea . He goes back to the tent , crawls inside briefly , and stands up outside again , pulling on white long-handled underwear . He pulls his shoes back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around him , and so nearly approximate to its color is the way he is dressed , that we actually have a very hard time following him as he moves to the tree where his bow is hanging . He takes the bow down and strings it , a ghostly archer indeed . &nbsp; ED ( to himself , as he looks toward the woods ) Well , why not ? But just a little ways , Killer . Just a little ways .  --  51  --  We now show ED , when we can make him out , moving up along a small ravine or draw that runs back inland from behind the tents . He moves very cautiously , the bow always ready , but we also have , as he does himself , the distinct feeling that he is play-acting . He does n't think he is going to come on any game , and surely we do n't . We go along with him like this for perhaps twenty or thirty careful steps , until the land begins to rise and the fog , as a consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty well now , a ridiculous figure in long underwear in the woods , and we can see that he , too , feels himself to be pretty absurd . He turns around to start back down . He is getting back into the river fog now , and we see what he sees to the right and left of him as he descends . Then , to the left , there is a slight movement , and we stop and peer with him as he tries to make out what is causing it . We zoom in slowly , closer and closer to the object , and it gradually becomes apparent that it is a little deer , a spike buck from what we can tell . Now we are back on ED in a closeup of the upper half of his body , as he slowly raises the bow , scarcely daring to breathe , scarcely believing in his luck , and not knowing , really , whether he will actually shoot or not . We watch the orange frame of thread on his bowstring come back as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We now shift into the point of view of ED , as the bowstring peep sight frames the scene . As we first see this , the sight is not on the deer , and we try to frame the animal slowly , very slowly . The deer is browsing , not looking up , and ED brings him right to the center of the blurred frame of string . We are now on ED as he releases . But we have a quick but unmistakable knowledge that he has botched the shot , after all that preparation . His left hand , bow hand , has jerked up just as the shot went . &nbsp; ED ( hissing ) Goddamn it . He snatches loose another arrow from the bow quiver . We swing with him as he draws . The deer , which has evidently jumped a little farther away , watches him , and we again attempt to watch through the peep sight , but the sight is swinging erratically , and does n't frame the deer , but once or twice almost does . We  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the deer jumps and soundlessly vanishes . Full-length shot of ED as he very deliberately throws the bow into a bush , just as a golfer would toss a club . &nbsp; EDWell , that 's that ! He retrieves the bow , and starts down once more . A couple more shots of him in the ravine , not looking out for deer any more , much less cautious than when he went uphill , and then he is back at the tents . The mist is thinning out ; it is by now almost gone . LEWIS is making a fire with twigs . He turns and sees ED , and gives a sharp look at the two empty slots in the bow quiver . &nbsp; LEWIS ( nodding at bow ) What about it , buddy ? &nbsp; ED ( disgustedly ) I got a shot . &nbsp; LEWIS ( straightening ) You did ? &nbsp; EDI did . A spectacular miss at fifteen yards . I boosted my bow hand , like a goddamned idiot . I just exploded , that 's all . I psyched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could do anything about it , I did it . &nbsp; LEWISWell , that 's too bad . We could ' a had meat . &nbsp; DREW ( sympathetically ) You 'll get another chance . We got a long ways to go yet . &nbsp; EDLewis , you do n't need to tell me . I know without anybody saying a damned thing that you would 've racked him right up . We 'd have meat , we 'd all live forever . Life would mean something again . You know what I was really thinking about , up there ? I was thinking about you , wishing it was you lining up on that miserable little animal . &nbsp; LEWIS ( with a curious , sidelong look ) Well , next time do n't think about me . Think about the deer . Various shots , now , of the men breaking camp : rolling the air from air mattresses , folding the tents , and so on . They sit and eat quickly the food that LEWIS has been preparing for breakfast . This time it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expresses his displeasure in a way that is not as guarded as it might be . He has already about had enough of the  --  53  --  whole scene , of LEWIS and his schemes and theories , of the canoes , of all of it . There are a couple of shots which indicate that ED is trying to keep BOBBY from saying anything openly derogatory . He has BOBBY come over to the canoes and help him put the camping equipment into them . Two shot of ED and BOBBY loading the canoes . &nbsp; EDHow about it , tiger ? How about you and me taking on the " last wilderness " ? &nbsp; BOBBYOK . How far can we get today , do you reckon ? &nbsp; EDBeats me . We 'll get as far as we can . Depends on the water . I suppose we 'll run through the gorge , on down . That bothers me a little , but there 's nothing we can do about it now . &nbsp; ED ( to LEWIS ) We 're gon na sail on out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow . Shots of ED and BOBBY getting into the aluminum canoe , and shakily getting under way . When they get out into midstream it becomes evident as to just how inept BOBBY is . He 's in terrible shape physically , he is uncoordinated , he is unwilling , he is disagreeable . &nbsp; ED ( with an attempt at being good-natured about it ) Easy ! Easy ! You 're trying too hard . All we want to do is hold this thing straight . We do n't need to be pulling our guts out to get there . Just let the river do it . Let George do it . &nbsp; BOBBYGeorge ai n't doing it fast enough . I want to get the hell and gone out of this goddamned place . &nbsp; EDAh , now . It 's not all that bad ! &nbsp; BOBBYIt 's not ? Listen . Mosquitoes ate me up last night . My bites have got bites . I 'm catching a fucking cold from sleeping on the fucking ground . I 'm hungry as hell for something that tastes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDJust steady down a little . It 's not gon na do your cold any good to dump in this river , you can bloody well bet .  --  54  --  &nbsp; BOBBYFuck it . Let 's get on with it , I 'm tired of this woods scene . I 'm tired of shitting in a hole in the ground . This is for the Indians . They go along for a while , not speaking , and they make somewhat better progress , though they are awfully low in the water . Meanwhile LEWIS and DREW have come up alongside , and ED motions for them to put over to the right-hand bank , which they do . All tie up and get out on the bank . &nbsp; LEWISGetting hot . &nbsp; EDHot as the hinges . &nbsp; LEWISDid you see that big snake back yonder ? &nbsp; EDNo . Where ? &nbsp; LEWISHe was lying up in the limbs of that old oak tree you went under about a mile back . I did n't see him till you were right under him , and he lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuss ; thought it might make him nervous . I 'm pretty sure it was a moccasin . I 've heard of them dropping in boats . &nbsp; BOBBYShit fire ! That 's all we need . &nbsp; LEWIS ( laconically , and to ED rather than to BOBBY ) Yeah . I can imagine . &nbsp; EDCan you take some of the stuff in our canoe , Lewis ? We 're awful low and logy . &nbsp; LEWISSure . Go get the cooking equipment and the bedrolls . That ought to equalize us , just about . You can also let us have about half the beer that 's left . &nbsp; EDHappy to . Everybody 's going to need something to cool off with , today . &nbsp; LEWIS ( unbuttoning his shirt ) Why do it just with beer ? It 's shallow and slow here . I 'm going to get wet . Shot of LEWIS stripping off and diving in , while ED is transferring the equipment from one canoe to the other . LEWIS booms downstream like Johnny Weismuller , then turns and heads back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wades into the stream . DREW dives in , going past  --  55  --  ED . The three of them swim while BOBBY , with his head cold , sits on the bank and resignedly watches . The three who are swimming play around in the water a little , at first a little self-consciously but then not so much , and you can see the very end of boyhood in some of their actions , still very faintly apparent . They all come to stand together , in water about waist-deep near the bank where BOBBY is sitting . In close on LEWIS , who is standing with his hands on his hips , breathing deeply , water running down his face and over his chest . His physical strength and power are so evident that they are is wiping the water out of his eyes , excited , amazed and happy to be doing what he is doing . &nbsp; DREWGosh , this feels good ! I never felt anything more wonderful in my life . It 's refreshing , you know ? That 's what it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see LEWIS standing there as he is doing , and we get another good look at LEWIS , who has not changed his position since the last time we saw him . He seems to dominate everything : the other men , the woods and the river , the whole world . ) &nbsp; DREW ( with honest admiration ) How on earth do you manage to stay in such shape , Lewis ? &nbsp; LEWIS ( after a moment ) I put my time in . &nbsp; DREW ( to BOBBY now ) You better come on in for a minute , Bobby . It 'll really cool you off . &nbsp; BOBBYNo thanks . Whenever you 're ready , me and the other Fatso will just Fatso on down , the washed and the unwashed . Two shot of ED and LEWIS . &nbsp; EDYou getting any mystical vibrations from the woods , Tarzan ? &nbsp; LEWIS ( who tries to indicate , out of friendship , that he thinks this is funny , but really does n't ) Maybe . &nbsp; DREW ( coming over to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you stay in it too long will freeze your ass off . This is about it for me , I expect .  --  56  --  DREW gets out , and after a moment of talk between them we ca n't hear , so do LEWIS and ED . Several shots of ED and BOBBY transferring equipment from their aluminum canoe to the green wooden one . Then shot of ED and BOBBY getting ready to embark . We see that in their canoe they only have one tent , a six-pack of beer , DREW 's guitar , protected as well as they can protect it in these circumstances , and ED 's bow and arrows , which are now very prominently displayed in the relatively bare canoe . They get in and shove off , and it is apparent to the audience that they are going to do a lot better this way . They can see this too , and they begin to look , really , like a pretty fair team . We should now have a good many shots , at the discretion of the director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These are for two reasons . The first is to show the land getting wilder and more thickly wooded , and to show how the hard work of canoeing in slow water is beginning to tell on the men . We also have a chance , here , to show some extraordinarily beautiful southern river country , with various creeks and falls on either bank , and so on . On the right bank a heron leaps out over the river , and ED looks at it with astonished delight . The bird disappears , and then , as they come around another turn , flushes again , beats his way downstream , disappears again , and when they round yet another turn , does the same thing . The heron 's cry is strange and otherworldly , creepy and inhuman , though with something of human agony in it , even so . Shot of ED paddling industriously , not killing himself but working pretty hard , and getting hot . He keeps having to wipe sweat out of his eyes , and after he does this he squints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unending . Every now and then he gets some water out of the river and rubs it over his face . Shot of him drinking a beer , and a shot of BOBBY drinking two , one after the other . Shot of the bow with its black-and-green , orange-feathered arrows , the heads shining with deadly light . Sequence of shots of canoe moving through a very dense , packed fir forest , where the air is twice as  --  57  --  breathless and still as it is on the open river . There is a cathedrallike silence here , and we feel it as they feel it , lifting their paddles out of the water and just drifting through on silence and mystery and heat . We see a snake slip into the water on the left bank and swim , with exactly the same motion as crawling on land , across in front of the canoe , then disappear , still in the same motion and at the same speed , in the weeds on the other side . &nbsp; BOBBY ( speaking back over his shoulder ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! &nbsp; EDNo , buddy . We wo n't . They are now getting awfully hot and tired . They are shown finishing the last two beers . BOBBY throws his can carelessly into the river , and ED carefully holds his underwater until it fills , and then lets it go down . ED keeps shifting around uncomfortably , now , trying to ease his back , his right hip . He keeps running his tongue around inside his dry mouth , and picking up water from the river and putting it on his head and bald spot .  --  58  --  &nbsp; BOBBY ( half-turning again ) Let 's put in for a little while . This is getting to me . &nbsp; ED ( looking backward for the other canoe and not seeing it ) I 'm for that . We can wait for the others to catch up . Maybe they 've got some more beer . Shot of the canoe making for the left bank . As they go toward it , we notice a creek foaming whitely into the main river , covered with bushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from the plants themselves . They pull in and tie up to the bank , then climb out and sit down , relieved to be in the shade . BOBBY unties a handkerchief from around his neck and leans down and sops it in the river . He sits beside ED , and they both peer upriver . &nbsp; BOBBY ( squinting ) Wonder what the hell Lewis and Drew are doing up there , anyway ? &nbsp; EDProbably the same thing we are . They 'll be along in a little while . BOBBY rubs at his face and neck with the handkerchief . ED gets painfully up , and bends down and touches his  --  59  --  toes a couple of times to get the kinks out . He peers upriver once again , does n't see anything , then turns back to say something to BOBBY . We now see what ED sees as he turns . Before his gaze comes to rest on BOBBY , it stops on two men at the edge of woods , shadowy and very silent . One of them may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; ED ( peering to make them out better ) Bobby ! The two men emerge from the brush , and we can see that the taller of them does indeed have a gun : an old , old shotgun . BOBBY turns , sees the men , and gets up slowly , brushing at himself as he does so . &nbsp; BOBBY ( to the man , and with a lot more confidence than he feels ) How goes it ? The men are still stepping forward , with a curious , tiptoeing , sideways walk , as though stepping around something that no one but them can see is there . We get a good look at the men now , and what we see is horrifying . If there were ever any degenerate rednecks , they are these two . One of them is about fifty-five , in overalls and a filthy work shirt . He has a mangy whitish beard . The other one , the man with the gun , is younger , and his toothlessness should be the most obvious thing about him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty shirt and pants . They keep coming . The older man comes up to ED , and gets himself ridiculously close . The faces are no more than four or five inches apart . There is silence , while the man looks fiercely and ED tries to think of something to say . &nbsp; BEARDED MAN ( revealing awful stumps of teeth , orange and broken ) What the hail you think you 're doin ' ? &nbsp; ED ( as matter-of-factly as he can ) Going downriver . We 've been going since yesterday . BEARDED MAN looks at TALL MAN , and something significant seems to pass between them . &nbsp; ED ( trying desperately to tell his story ) We started from Oree yesterday afternoon , and we hope we can get to Aintry sometime late today or early tomorrow .  --  60  --  &nbsp; BEARDED MANAintry ? &nbsp; BOBBY ( with something of his smart-aleck city manner ) Sure . This river just runs one way , cap'n . Have n't you heard ? &nbsp; BEARDED MAN ( to both of them ) You ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ED ( really startled and frightened now , but trying to bluff it out ) Why not ? &nbsp; BEARDED MANBecause this river do n't go to Aintry . You done taken a wrong turn somewhere . This-here river do n't go nowhere near Aintry . &nbsp; EDWhere does it go ? &nbsp; BEARDED MANIt goes ... it goes ... &nbsp; TALL MAN ( very toothlessly ) It goes to Circle Gap . ' Bout fifty miles . &nbsp; BEARDED MAN ( turning back his face close to ED 's again , even closer than before ) Boy , you do n't know where you are . &nbsp; ED ( resignedly ) Well , we 're going where the river 's going . We 'll come out somewhere , I reckon . With a very slight move , the TALL MAN gets himself nearer to BOBBY . &nbsp; ED ( trying to be as convincing and harmless and as full of good-will toward strangers as he can ) Hell , we do n't have anything to do with you . We sure do n't want any trouble . If you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . We could never tell anybody where it is , because you know something ? You 're right . We do n't know where we are . &nbsp; TALL MAN ( seeming honestly surprised ) A stee-ul ? &nbsp; ED ( as friendly as possible , but how friendly is that ? ) Sure . If you 're making whiskey , we 'll buy some from you . We could sure use it . &nbsp; BEARDED MAN ( squarely into ED 's face ) Do you know what the hail you 're talkin ' about ? &nbsp; EDI do n't know what you 're talking about .  --  61  --  &nbsp; BEARDED MANYou done said something about makin ' whiskey . You think we 're makin ' whiskey . Now come on . Ai n't that right ? &nbsp; ED ( genuinely outdone by this time ) Look . I do n't know what you 're doing . I do n't know whether you 're making whiskey or hunting or rambling around in the woods for your whole fucking life . I do n't know what you 're doing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not any of my business . Despite himself , ED tries quickly to look up the river for the other canoe , but it still is not in sight . The BEARDED MAN also glances at the river . &nbsp; BEARDED MANAnybody else with you ? &nbsp; ED ( trying desperately to figure out whether he should say yes or no , comes to his conclusion . He says , deliberately , and so that BOBBY can make no mistake about what he says ) No . The TALL MAN reaches over and feels of BOBBY 's arm , in a strangely delicate gesture . BOBBY jerks back , and when he does the barrel of the shotgun comes up , just a little , but definitely . &nbsp; ED ( as though the interview were over ) We 'd better get on with it . We 've got a long ways to go . &nbsp; TALL MAN ( very decisively , all pretense now past ) You ai n't goin ' nowhere . TALL MAN levels the shotgun right at ED 's chest . &nbsp; TALL MAN ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in here ' less you want your guts all over this-here woods . ED half-raises his arms as though playing a part amateurishly in a movie about badmen . He can not believe that this is happening . The four of them go inland a few steps from the river , behind a screen of bushes and weeds . &nbsp; TALL MANBack up to that saplin ' . &nbsp; ED ( indicating a tree with his raised hands ) This one ? Ed backs up to a small tree , and the TALL MAN , working quickly and expertly , takes off ED 's web belt  --  62  --  with the knife and nylon rope on it , lets the belt out and puts it around ED and the tree with the buckle on the other side of the tree . He takes the knife out of the belt , slowly , and stands looking at it with the shotgun pointing at BOBBY . &nbsp; TALL MAN ( mock-admiringly ) Look at that ! I bet that 'll shave h'ar . &nbsp; BEARDED MAN ( coming into frame ) Why'ont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . ' Cept on his head . We now look from ED 's point of view , the camera shaking slightly , and focus on the knife , as it flashes in the sun that comes down through the leaves . Very deliberately the TALL MAN takes hold , with the hand that holds the knife , of the zipper to ED 's coveralls , and with a quick movement like tearing ED apart , he zips it down to the belt with which ED is tied to the tree . &nbsp; BEARDED MAN ( offscreen ) Good God Almighty ! He 's like a goddamned monkey . You ever see anything like that ? &nbsp; TALL MAN ( placing the point of the knife under ED 's chin and forcing him to hold his head unnaturally high ) You ever had your balls cut off , you fuckin ' ape ? &nbsp; ED ( obviously terrified but trying to hold onto something of himself , his pride ) Not lately . What good would they do you ? TALL MAN scrapes across ED 's chest with blade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood on it . &nbsp; TALL MANSharp , all right . Could be sharper , but it 's sharp . We now go close in on toothless face of TALL MAN , as a terrible and purely malevolent expression comes over his features . He looks , quite literally , as if he would do anything : is just about to do it , in fact . Suddenly and very unexpectedly he raises the knife over his head and drives it down with all his might , with a furious and final movement . The audience should feel that he has driven it into ED . Cut now to pp. 32-49 &nbsp; pp. 63-84 ED 'S FACE AND HE LOOKS AS THOUGH HE HAS BEEN MORTALLY WOUNDED ED 's face , and he looks as though he has been mortally wounded . But as we pull back more , we see that the  --  63  --  knife has in fact been struck into the tree right next to ED 's head . We hold this shot for a moment , with light playing off the blade of the knife . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BEARDED MAN takes BOBBY by the shoulder and turns him to face downstream . &nbsp; BEARDED MAN ( very mater-of-factly ) Now let 's you just drop them pants . &nbsp; BOBBY ( afraid to comprehend ) Drop ? ... &nbsp; TALL MAN ( putting muzzle of shotgun under BOBBY 's ear ) Just take ' em right on off . &nbsp; BOBBY ( weakly ) I mean , what 's this all ? ... &nbsp; BEARDED MANDo n't say nothin ' . Just do it . TALL MAN shoves at BOBBY 's head with gun , suddenly and viciously . The abruptness and deadliness of the TALL MAN 's actions should always take us unawares . BOBBY slowly unbuckles his belt and unbuttons his pants . He takes them off , looking around ridiculously for a place to put them down . &nbsp; BEARDED MAN ( indicating BOBBY 's undershorts ) Them panties , too . BOBBY takes off his shorts like a boy undressing for the first time in a gym . &nbsp; TALL MAN ( gesturing with gun ) See that log ? Walk over yonder . BOBBY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground and stands there . Close-up of just BOBBY and the log , in some sort of as-yet-undivulged relationship . &nbsp; VOICE OF TALL MAN ( offscreen ) Now git on down crost it . Close in still more to close-up of BOBBY 's head , as gun muzzle comes into frame and positions itself just under his right ear . Now we shift back to ED 's point of view . First we see him gasping for breath against the tightness of the belt , then he shakes his head from side to side and tosses it back and forth in an effort to get free , get breath . The following sequence is all filmed from this point of view , with the camera reeling and  --  64  --  tracking unexpectedly and violently , as ED would be tossing his head . We also raise the sound of ED 's breathing , so that this whole rape sequence is permeated with the heavy , desperate , irregular breathing of a bound , terrified man . We see shots of the dizzy treetops as ED turns his face momentarily straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see BOBBY and the two men momentarily , the BEARDED MAN unfastening his pants , the TALL MAN standing impassively with the gun pointing down into some bushes , where BOBBY is crouched over the log . We have a couple of moments of these swaying , uncertain shots , and then the first scream hits us . It is almost deafening , and there is a note of dreadful surprise in it . A second later there is another scream , one of pure , animal , human pain . During these shots the intensity of ED 's head-tossing -- and consequently of the erratic quality of the camera work --  increases , so that at moments it appears that we are in a kind of whirling bowl of woods , of leaves and trees and branches . All this time the screams go on , punctuated by ED 's heavy breathing . We see one very quick view of the bushes where BOBBY and the men are : see enough to sense that there is some kind of rhythmic activity going on there , and at the same time we notice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full close-up of ED 's face , with blood running down from under his chin and the knife sticking and glinting in the tree beside his head . He is looking straight ahead , not tossing any more , and on his face is an expression of unbelief and the beginnings of a fantastic kind of hope . Now we see what he sees . Through a curtain of leaves , we can barely make out -- but we can make out -- the green canoe with LEWIS and DREW in it . They both have their paddles out of the water . Then the canoe disappears , having turned toward the bank where the action is taking place . Slowly and more steadily the gaze of ED -- and the camera -- swings back toward the bushes , and we see the BEARDED MAN rising , a little unsteadily , to his feet . There are no more screams . The BEARDED MAN makes a long kind of strange sigh , as he stands there buttoning his pants . We have a glimpse of BOBBY rolling in pain under the bushes . After they reorganize themselves for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without saying a word ,  --  65  --  turn from BOBBY and advance with dreadful purpose toward the tree where ED is tied . We see them come , step by step , the TALL MAN still with the gun . The BEARDED MAN goes around behind the tree . We see ED and the tree jerk violently , and ED suddenly falls free . He almost stumbles , but brings up quickly , for we see the gun muzzle just under his nose . &nbsp; TALL MAN ( offscreen ) You 're kind of ball-headed and fat , ai n't you ? &nbsp; ED ( gasping , resigned to anything but having his head blown off ) What do you want me to say ? Yeah . I 'm bald-headed and fat . That OK ? &nbsp; TALL MANYou 're hairy as a goddamned dog , ai n't you ? &nbsp; EDSome dogs , I suppose . &nbsp; TALL MAN ( half turning to BEARDED MAN ) Now what the hail ... ? &nbsp; BEARDED MAN ( offscreen ) Ai n't no hair in his mouth . &nbsp; TALL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the truth . Hold this on him . TALL MAN extends hand with gun in it to BEARDED MAN , all the time still looking straight at ED . &nbsp; TALL MAN ( with deadly seriousness ) Fall down on your knees , boy . You gon na do a little praying . And you better pray good . TALL MAN begins to unbutton his pants . We see a three shot of them , with ED going down slowly to his knees , the BEARDED MAN getting ready to position himself to hold the gun on ED , the TALL MAN loosening his pants . We see now what ED sees , from his position on his knees . We hear an odd sound offscreen , kind of quick slap-snap : a sound like a quick , sharp indrawn breath . Close-up of face of BEARDED MAN . He makes a loud involuntary surprised gasp , like that of a man with the wind knocked out of him unexpectedly . He does not yet look down . Cut to ED 's view again . It is first on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that to the  --  66  --  BEARDED MAN 's chest . A foot and a half of bright red arrow is protruding from the middle of it . Three shot again , as they hang motionless for a moment , all of them too amazed to act . The gun starts to fall from the BEARDED MAN 'S hand . ED is nearest it , and he grabs for it , clumsily but with the strength of panic . The TALL MAN also reaches for it , and even touches it briefly , but ED has a better grip ; this is instantaneously recognized by both of them , and then the TALL MAN leaps away into the bushes and is gone . The leaves do not even tremble where he disappears . Cut now to Close-up of ED as he rises , transfigured by terror and by the turn events have taken . He is beastlike with the power of having the gun . He wraps the string the gun uses for a trigger around his hand and swings the barrel to cover the woods and everything in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We see a confused shot of the clearing , with BOBBY still rolling in the bushes , but beginning to have some comprehension that things have changed in some way , for we get a glimpse of the expression on his face , which now includes amazement as well as  --  67  --  pain . The confusion of the shot now narrows and settles down and closes in on one figure : the BEARDED MAN . He is standing stock still , with his feet wide apart . He reaches down with a trembling , broken-nailed hand and touches the shaft of the arrow delicately . Extreme close-up of just the bloody arrow and the tentative , weak hand . Now we go back to a full shot of the man as he falls to his knees and then to his side , rolling back and forth , spitting and gritting his teeth . Then he gets , with awful comic seriousness , back onto his feet again , this time with his lips red with blood and drooling saliva and blood . He turns toward the woods and takes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change his mind and turns back to ED , holding out one hand like an Old Testament prophet about to divulge a secret to one of the chosen . Close-up of ED as he makes the decision to fire . We see him begin to pull the string , utter determination on his face . But there is no need . Suddenly the BEARDED MAN falls , partly on his face and partly on his side , his face coming to rest on the tops of ED 's white tennis shoes . We see that he has a bubble of blood in his mouth , red as an apple . This breaks , and there is only a thin stream of blood running down under his ear . Three shot once more , as ED lowers the gun barrel a little . &nbsp; ED ( shaking his head in utter disbelief ) Well . &nbsp; BOBBY ( from the ground , and still half in the bushes ) Lord God . Lord God . Section Details SHOT OF ED LOOKING DOWN AT THE BEARDED MAN Shot of ED looking down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BEARDED MAN , and very prominent now is the silver of the aluminum arrow shaft and the fancy blue-and-silver marking of the white-feathered arrow sticking out of his back . There can be no doubt that he has been shot from behind . We hold , now , on the whole scene in the clearing , with ED peering into the woods , swinging the half-lowered gun back and forth , and nothing else happening . We let this go on for a little longer than it usually might do in most films . After this scene , we see that ED is peering intently into the woods on the upriver side .  --  68  --  Cut to See what ED sees , which is a slight irregularity of one of the big trees hidden in bushes . The bushes move more , stealthily , and LEWIS comes cautiously forward , another arrow on the string , his bow at the ready . He comes slowly into the clearing . DREW is behind him , holding a canoe paddle like a baseball bat . LEWIS walks out between ED and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He puts his bow tip on a leaf and gazes at it , about to say something . &nbsp; LEWIS ( meditatively ) Well now , how about this ? I mean , just ... how about this ? We see DREW move to BOBBY and crouch down beside him . He puts his hand on BOBBY 's shoulder and talks to him , but we ca n't hear what he 's saying . We can see , though , that he is very very sympathetic and gentle . BOBBY glances at him with great gratitude a couple of times . Finally BOBBY gets painfully up , and DREW helps him . Dazed , furious , and incongruous , BOBBY picks up his pants and shorts , fumblingly takes a handkerchief from a pocket , and goes back behind the bushes .  --  69  --  Two shot as ED turns to LEWIS and waits . &nbsp; LEWIS ( leaning on his bow and gazing out over the river , speaking decisively but a little abstractedly , too ) I figured it was the only thing to do . &nbsp; ED ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . I thought we 'd had it . I tell you I did . I thought sure they 'd kill us . &nbsp; LEWISProbably they would have . The penalty for sodomy in this state is death , anyway . And at the point of a gun .... No , they would n't have let you go . Why should they ? &nbsp; EDHow did you figure it ? &nbsp; LEWISWe heard Bobby , and the only thing we could think of was that one of you had been bit by a snake . But that would n't have explained all the ... the screaming . You know ? We started to come right in , but it struck me that there might be other people involved , and if there were I told Drew I 'd just as soon come in on them without them knowing it . &nbsp; ED ( with real curiosity ) What did you do ? &nbsp; LEWIS ( interested in telling how he figured the situation out , and how it turned out to be exactly the right diagnosis ) We turned in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then we shoved the canoe in some bushes and got out . I strung up and nocked an arrow , and we came on up to about thirty yards from where you were . As soon as I saw four people there , I began to shift around to find a place I could shoot through the leaves . Drew and I knew something awful was happening to Bobby . I could see you standing tied to the tree . I 'm sorry I could n't do anything for Bobby , but at least I did n't make a mis-move and get his head blown off . &nbsp; EDHow did you know when to shoot ? &nbsp; LEWISAny time that the gun was n't pointed at you and Bobby would 've been all right . I just had to wait till that time came . I was pretty sure they 'd swap the gun , eventually . When I saw they were getting ready to do that , I pulled down on this one ( LEWIS indicates BEARDED MAN with his foot ) , and when I got a clear shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him . I knew I had him when I let go . &nbsp; EDYou had him , and now what 're we going to do with him ?  --  70  --  DREW comes into the frame , washing his hands with dirt and beating them against the sides of his legs . &nbsp; DREW ( decisively ) There 's not but one thing to do . Put the body in one of the canoes and take it on down to Aintry and turn it over to the highway patrol . Tell them the whole story . ED glances at DREW uncertainly , and then looks back to LEWIS . &nbsp; LEWIS ( gazing out over the river ) Tell them what , exactly ? &nbsp; DREW ( becoming a little more passionate ) Just what happened ! This is justifiable homicide if anything is ! They were sexually assaulting two members of our party at gunpoint ! Like you said , there was nothing else we could do . &nbsp; LEWISNothing but shoot him in the back with an arrow ? &nbsp; DREW ( not sure what is going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ) It was your doing , Lewis . &nbsp; LEWIS ( still looking out onto the river ) What would you have done ? &nbsp; DREW ( hotly ) It does n't make any difference what I would have done . But I can tell you , I do n't believe ... &nbsp; LEWIS ( turning to face DREW directly ) Do n't believe what ? &nbsp; ED ( breaking in , trying to keep peace , trying to find something to do in a situation where there does n't seem to be anything to do , except something wrong ) Wait a minute . What we should or should n't have done is beside the point . He 's there ( ED gestures at BEARDED MAN without looking down at him ) and we 're here . We did n't start any of this . We did n't ask for it . But what happens now ? We hear a sound , a kind of terrible sigh , something like the sound the BEARDED MAN gave out with when he finished with BOBBY . For a moment the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the BEARDED MAN . The BEARDED MAN sighs again , a long , sobbing sound , and then slumps completely , and we know that he is really dead now : really dead . &nbsp; ED ( timorously ) Is he dead ?  --  71  --  LEWIS nods without looking up . &nbsp; LEWISHe is now . He 's mighty dead . We could n't have saved him , though . He 's center-shot . LEWIS rises , and the city men stand still for a moment , looking this way and that , all but LEWIS . LEWIS is gazing out over the river again . &nbsp; LEWIS ( coming to some sort of a conclusion , but wanting to give the reasons for it first ) Let 's just figure for a minute . Let 's just calm down and think about it . Does anybody know anything about the law ? &nbsp; DREWI 've been on jury duty exactly once . &nbsp; ED ( resignedly ) That 's once more than I have . And about all the different degrees of murder and homicide and manslaughter I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOBBY comes into frame , fiery-faced and violated and with that vindictiveness that only the violated can have . He shakes his head , his eyes murderously narrow . &nbsp; LEWIS ( continuing ) You do n't have to know much law to know that if we take this guy down out of these mountains and turn him over to the sheriff , there 's going to be an investigation , and I would bet we 'd go on trial . I do n't know what the charge would be , technically , but we 'd be up against a jury , sure as hell . &nbsp; DREW ( convinced of his innocence ) Well , so what ? &nbsp; LEWIS ( patiently ) All right , now . We 've killed a man . Shot him in the back . And we not only killed a man , we killed a cracker , a mountain man . Let 's consider what might happen . &nbsp; DREW ( stalwartly ) All right . Consider it . We 're listening . LEWIS relaxes for a moment and scratches his head . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to wait a minute before we decide to be so all-fired boy-scoutish and do the right thing . Because , you know something ? There 's not any right thing . &nbsp; DREW ( quite sure he is correct in what he says ) You bet there is . There 's only one thing .  --  72  --  LEWIS looks at DREW for a moment as though DREW were not nearly enough aware of what might , in brute , cold reality , happen to them as a result of their present situation . &nbsp; LEWIS ( persuasively ) We ought to do some hard decision-making before we let ourselves in for standing trial up in these hills . We do n't know who this man is , but we know that he lived up here . He may be an escaped convict , or he may have a still , or he may be everybody in the county 's father or brother or cousin . I can almost guarantee you that he 's got relatives all over the place . Everybody up here is kin to everybody else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he marshals more arguments ) And consider this , too . There 's a lot of resentment in these hill counties about the dam . There are going to have to be some cemeteries moved , like in the old TVA days . Things like that . LEWIS pauses to let all these things sink in . &nbsp; LEWIS ( continuing ) I 'm goddamned if I want to come back up here for shooting this guy in the back , with a jury made up of his cousins and brothers and maybe his father and mother , too , for all I know . No one says anything in answer . There are various gestures of helplessness and indecision . DREW stands very still , with his hands on his hips , getting his refutation together . &nbsp; LEWIS ( suddenly to BOBBY ) What do you think , Bobby ? Cut to BOBBY 's red , narrow-eyed , hate-filled face . A shot which shows BOBBY go quite deliberately over to the corpse and stand looking down at it . Suddenly , without any warning at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , and , before LEWIS can stop him , does it again . LEWIS pulls BOBBY back from the corpse gently but firmly , and BOBBY walks away from the group and the corpse . &nbsp; LEWIS ( turning to his buddy and part-time protg , ED ) How about you , Ed ? &nbsp; ED ( making a tremendous effort to come to a decision , and not being able to ) God , I do n't know . I really don't.  --  73  --  DREW has now got his argument together . He is frightened , but he is sure of the position he wants to take , and speaks with the decisiveness of a man who has to be right . &nbsp; DREW ( pointing deliberately down at the corpse ) I do n't know what you have in mind , Lewis . But if you conceal this body you 're setting yourself up for a murder charge . That much law I do know . And a murder charge is gon na be a little bit more than you 're gon na want to deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like you 've just been describing them . You better think about it , unless you want to start thinking about the electric chair . LEWIS looks at DREW with a genuinely interested expression on his face . &nbsp; LEWIS ( with his crazy , infectious , enthusiastic look ) Suppose there 's no body ? No body , no crime . Is n't that right ? &nbsp; DREW ( surprised and horrified indeed ) What on God 's earth are you thinking about , Lewis ? We 've got a right to know . And we damned well better get to doing something right quick . We ca n't just stand around and wring our hands . &nbsp; LEWIS ( placatingly , and also with authority ) Nobody 's wringing his hands . I 've just been thinking , while you 've been giving out with what we might call the conventional point of view . &nbsp; ED ( breaking in , sensing that LEWIS might have solved things for them , after all ) Thinking what ? &nbsp; LEWIS ( giving them the word ) Thinking of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with desperate intensity ) You 're a goddamned fool ! Doing what with the body ? Throwing it in the river ? That 's the first place they 'd look . &nbsp; LEWISWho 'd look ? &nbsp; DREWAnybody who was looking for him . Family , friends , police . The fellow who was with him , maybe . &nbsp; LEWIS ( developing his rationale , his secret ) We do n't have to put him in the river . &nbsp; DREW ( even more desperately , with utter conviction ) Lewis , you level with us . This is not one of your fucking games . You killed somebody . There he is.  --  74  --  DREW points down again , and this time the three of them look down where he points , at the corpse . &nbsp; LEWISI did kill him . But you 're wrong when you say this is nothing like a game . It may be the most serious kind of game there is , but if you do n't see it as a game , you 're missing an important point . &nbsp; ED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times before ) Come on , Lewis . For once let 's not carry on this way . &nbsp; LEWIS ( turning suddenly on ED like an animal ) Ed , you listen , and listen good . We can get out of this , I think . Get out without any questions asked , and no troubles of any kind , if we just take hold in the next hour and do a couple of things right . ( LEWIS is now at his most enthusiastically persuasive ) If we think it through and act it through and do n't make any mistakes , we can get out without a thing ever being said about it . If we connect up with the law , we 'll be connected to this man , this body , for the rest of our lives . We 've got to get rid of him . &nbsp; ED ( excited with hope , but still doubtful ) How ? Where ? Shot from behind LEWIS that shows him slowly and almost majestically raise his right hand and extend his arm fully , then sweep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the trees , the whole wilderness . &nbsp; LEWIS ( quietly and very impressively ) Everywhere . Shot of ED 's face , then of DREW 's , very set , and then of BOBBY 's full of hate , weakness , and killing rage . &nbsp; LEWISAnywhere . Nowhere . Shot of tangle of upriver woods . We hold shot of woods , as we hear DREW offscreen . &nbsp; DREW ( excitedly ) Yes . Sure . We could do something with him . We could throw him in the river . We could bury him . We could even burn him up . But they 'd find him , or find something , if they came looking . And how about the other one ? The one who was with him ? All he 's got to do is go and bring ... &nbsp; LEWISBring who ? I doubt if he 'd want anybody , much less the sheriff or the state police , to know what he was doing when this character ...  --  75  --  ( quick shot of corpse clutching arrow as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protecting it ) &nbsp; LEWIS ... was shot . Shot of men standing over corpse again . &nbsp; LEWISHe may bring somebody back here , though I doubt it , but it wo n't be the law . And if he does come back here , so what ? LEWIS touches the corpse with his bow tip , and turns squarely to face DREW . &nbsp; LEWIS ( finishing ) He wo n't be here . &nbsp; DREW ( facing just as squarely to confront LEWIS ) Where 'll he be ? Silence , as the two pairs of eyes battle in the air . Neither DREW nor LEWIS is going to back down an inch ; we can see that . &nbsp; DREW ( continuing ) And how do you know that other guy ( DREW gestures toward woods ) is not around here right now ? It just might be that he 's watching everything you do , Lewis . We would n't be so hard to follow , dragging a corpse off somewhere and ditching it . He could find some way to let the police know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other . You look around , Lewis . He could be anywhere . Close-up of ED , to show how this registers on him , which is powerfully . He tries not to look around , but ca n't help himself . He cuts his eyes this way and that , almost superhumanly apprehensive and alert . Then his eyes come back to LEWIS , and they see LEWIS standing , as we see , relaxed , leaning on his bow , apparently not worried at all , in complete charge of the situation . On seeing him this way , we feel the relief that ED feels . We would follow LEWIS anywhere , and now we realize that we are going to have to do just that . &nbsp; LEWIS ( abruptly , out of his seeming reverie ) Let 's figure . As though this were a command , which indeed it is , the others , including BOBBY , draw close to LEWIS . They stand facing each other across the corpse , LEWIS and ED on one side and DREW and BOBBY on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in his mouth , then crouches over the dead man like a pro football quarterback planning instant strategy .  --  76  --  &nbsp; LEWIS ( very slowly and reasonably ) If we take him on the river in the canoe we 'll be out in the open . If somebody was watching he could see where we dropped him in . Besides , like Drew says , the river 's the first place anybody 'd look . ( he looks up challengingly ) Where does that leave us ? &nbsp; EDUpstream or down . &nbsp; LEWISOr in . Or maybe a combination . &nbsp; ED ( getting truly interested in the problem-solving aspect of the situation ) Which combination ? Close-up of LEWIS with the grass-blade in his mouth . &nbsp; LEWISI 'd say a combination of in and up . Suppose we took him downstream along the bank . We 're heading downriver , and if we wanted to get rid of him as fast as possible , we 'd bury him or leave him somewhere along the way . Shot of ED slowly nodding his head in assent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEWIS is saying , as LEWIS talks offscreen . &nbsp; LEWIS ( offscreen ) So .... We take him inland , and upstream . We carry him to that little creek , and up it until we find a good place , and then we bury him and the gun . And I 'd be willing to bet that nothing will ever come of it . These woods are full of more human bones than anybody 'll ever know ; people disappear up here all the time , and nobody ever hears about it . And in about a month or six weeks the valley 'll be flooded , and the whole area will be hundreds of feet underwater . Do you think the state is going to hold up this project just to look for some hillbilly ? Especially if they do n't know where he is , or even if he 's in the woods at all ? It 's not likely . And in six weeks ... Cut to LEWIS , as he talks with utter conviction and convincingness . &nbsp; LEWIS ( continuing ) ... well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried under it  --  under it  --  is as buried as it can get . Cut to DREW , who is shaking his head vigorously .  --  77  --  &nbsp; DREWI 'm telling you , I do n't want any part of it . LEWIS rises and faces DREW very deliberately . This is the showdown between them , and all four men know it . So does the audience . &nbsp; LEWIS ( with all his enormous male vitality and physical power ) What do you mean , Drew ? You are part of it . You want to be honest , you want to do the right thing . But you have n't got the guts to take a chance . Believe me , if we do this right , we 'll go home as clean as we came . That is , if somebody does n't cop out . &nbsp; DREW ( staunchly ) You know better than that , Lewis . But I ca n't go along with this . It 's not a matter of guts . It 's a matter of the law . Shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand to indicate the wilderness they 're in . &nbsp; LEWISYou see any law around here ? We 're the law . What we decide is going to be the way things are . So let 's vote on it . I 'll go along with the vote . And so will you , Drew . You 've got no choice . LEWIS turns to BOBBY . We see BOBBY 's hideously weak and hate-ridden , violated face .  --  78  --  &nbsp; BOBBY ( in a thick , strangled voice ) I say get rid of the son of a bitch . Do you think I want this to get around ? LEWIS turns to ED as though playing his trump card , which indeed he is . &nbsp; LEWISEd ? DREW suddenly steps over the corpse and confronts ED , putting the flat of his hand in front of ED 's face and shaking it with violent emphasis . He has got to get ED to agree with him and split the vote . &nbsp; DREW ( with all the urgency he has ) Think what you 're doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maniac is going to get us all in jail for life , if he does n't get us killed . You 've got a family . You 're not implicated in this unless you go along with what Lewis wants to do . Listen to reason , do n't do this thing . Ed , do n't . I 'm begging you . Do n't . There is silence , and once more we see the faces of each of the men , one after the other . LEWIS is waiting confidently , DREW is grim and adamant , BOBBY is full of hatred , and ED is coming to the all-important decision . &nbsp; ED ( leaning out so as to speak to LEWIS around DREW ) I 'm with you . The spell of debate and decision-making is over . LEWIS gets down by the corpse again , all business this time . &nbsp; LEWISAll right then . LEWIS drags the arrow shaft out of the body slowly and laboriously , broadhead first . He gets up as we follow him to the river , where he washes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dripping arrow and clips it into his bow quiver . Brief close-up of arrow in quiver , where it looks just like the others , except that it is wet . A shot of ED taking his knife out of the sapling , putting it in the scabbard and buckling back on the belt with the knife and the rope . We now see LEWIS , with silent signals , positioning each of the men to carry the corpse . They are very  --  79  --  awkward about it , with ED and DREW carrying the shoulders and LEWIS and BOBBY the feet . They begin to carry the body feet foremost into the woods upriver toward the creek . We follow this operation for a while , as they flounder in the bushes , almost falling from time to time , BOBBY cursing , and so on . Once we hear , alarmingly close , a racheting sound that very well may be a rattlesnake . A shot of where the feet of the men are , out of sight in thick brush , and we realize , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snake even if they knew where it was . We see the various faces of the men as they struggle . LEWIS 's is calm and purposeful , and DREW keeps shaking his head as though he simply can not believe in this folly . Finally they get to the creek , and the green canoe . The creek is very brushy , and limbs from both banks meet over it and trail into the water . Shot of the men putting the corpse into the canoe , and then the gun . They begin to lead the canoe upstream in the creek , away from the main river . Here is more difficulty , as we see them lifting limbs out of their faces , see branches whip back suddenly and strike somebody in the face , and all the time we hear the muttering and swirling of the creek water through the leaves . Nobody says anything to anybody else ; the only things we hear from the four men are exclamations and an occasional startled curse . Finally LEWIS holds up a hand , and they stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LEWIS goes up the left , bank of the creek and disappears almost instantaneously . Shot of the others standing , holding the canoe between them , waiting : just waiting . No one speaks . We let them stand for a while , listening to the water . A shot of the woods surrounding them , with the purpose of indicating how awesomely deep and forbidding they are . LEWIS reappears as suddenly as he disappeared . A branch seems to raise itself from the water of its own accord , and LEWIS MEDLOCK comes through . He nods confidently and signals , pointing where they are to go .  --  80  --  Shot of the men taking the corpse and gun from the canoe and struggling up the bank with them . We see that ED has also taken a GI entrenching tool from the green canoe . More shots of struggling through woods , through big , gloomy-looking oak thickets , and so on . The forest here has a funereal , swampy look . Various shots showing the men toiling along with the body . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shots should convey the stifling , breathless quality of this part of the woods . The party twists and turns among the trees , and in a few minutes the viewer has no idea of what their relation is to the creek , or even to the river . The feeling of utter lostness should be very strong here . Unexpectedly , LEWIS holds up a hand , and following his example , the others aid him in letting the corpse down onto the ground . LEWIS motions for ED , and ED steps up to him . In a kind of silent ceremony  --  very ritualistic  --  LEWIS unclips the death arrow and hands it to ED , who takes it , now knowing exactly what LEWIS wants him to do with it . He examines it as he would any other arrow , then hands it back to LEWIS . Shot disclosing that they are next to a blue-black seepage of water like a sump of some kind . As though he were competing in an archery tournament , LEWIS puts the arrow on the string of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sump . We see him stand there until the tension in the audience really begins to build , wondering what he is taking so long for . Shot of his face in utter concentration . We move the camera behind him , and as it comes to rest looking over his shoulder , he releases . The death arrow disappears into the water . LEWIS stands holding his form , his follow-through . It is perfect . He is deep in what is almost a Zen-like concentration . LEWIS breaks his own spell , and we have a shot now of the men picking up the corpse once more . More shots of the struggle to carry the body through the woods . LEWIS turns , pointing down directly underfoot . The men put the body down . LEWIS motions for the entrenching tool , adjusts its handle , then falls to his knees and starts digging . The others come down to the ground with him and start digging with their hands . It is fairly easy work , and we watch them at it long enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a  --  81  --  kind of frenzy to get rid of the body . We watch them digging like animals , throwing dirt this way and that . Again , we see how each man , individually , reacts to what he is doing . We are especially struck with the self-absorbed efficiency of DREW , who is working harder and getting more done than any of them , except LEWIS , who has the shovel . We hear their heavy , irregular breathing in the thick , ominous stillness . Finally LEWIS stops digging . We move the camera so that we are looking directly into the two-foot-deep hole they have dug . It is a very makeshift grave indeed , with ferns growing around it . We see the body lying there beside the digging men , serene and indifferent , and the gun beside it . Shot of LEWIS solemnly nodding his head . Shot of DREW crossing himself . Shot of all of them rolling the corpse in a very undignified way into the grave . Shot of corpse lying in shallow trench they 've dug . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then LEWIS reaches back and gets the gun . He puts it into the grave , looks at his " arrangement " for a moment , then reaches back into the trench and makes some final adjustment . He draws back , apparently satisfied . &nbsp; LEWIS ( conclusively ) OK.  --  82  --  Shot of the four men shoveling and scrambling the dirt back into the grave . Shot of body slowly being made to disappear under the four-part volley of dirt and leaves . At last he is totally covered , and we see LEWIS smoothing the leaf mold over him . We see DREW looking intently at ED , as though his gaze were telling ED to do something before it gets to be too late . Shot of LEWIS resting on his knees beside the grave . &nbsp; LEWIS ( with conviction ) Ferns 'll be growing here in a few days . Nobody 'd ever come on him in a million years . I doubt if even we could find this place again . Shot of DREW , as he makes his last appeal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure you know what you 're doing . Cut to LEWIS , as he gets to his feet , rubbing the dirt and leaf mold off his hands . &nbsp; LEWIS ( with all his old conviction ) I 'm sure . The first rain will kill every sign we made . There 's not  --  83  --  a dog can follow us here . When we get off this river , we 'll be all right . Believe me . Shots of the four men heading back to canoe , with LEWIS consulting a wrist compass every now and then , and pointing out the way . More shots of faces , relieved and exhausted and terrified . LEWIS leads on . And on and on . There is no sound except for the contact their bodies make with the branches and foliage . Shot of the party coming back to the creek , and we follow as they wade down along it to the green canoe . All four of them get in , with DREW at the front paddle and LEWIS at the rear . Shots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with DREW fending off the branches and leaves as they go , LEWIS paddling powerfully and confidently . Shot of the creek foliage bursting apart slowly to reveal the open river . Brief shot of ED 's face , relieved almost as though he were seeing a vision , as the river shows ! LEWIS has got them this far ; he may take them all the way . Shots of them all getting out on the bank , beside the other canoe . LEWIS stands among the others with his hand to his chin , assessing the situation . &nbsp; BOBBYLet 's get the hell out of here . For God 's sake , let 's move . &nbsp; LEWISLet me figure a minute . ( he turns expressly to BOBBY ) This is no time for vanity or hurt feelings . How much work do you think you can do , Bobby ? &nbsp; BOBBY ( uncertainly ) I do n't know , Lewis , I 'll try . &nbsp; LEWISIt 's not your fault , but trying is not going to be enough . We 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I expect I 'd better take Bobby with me. ( he turns to ED ) How do you feel , Ed ? How much can you do ? How much have you got left ? &nbsp; EDI do n't know . Some . &nbsp; LEWISAll right . You and Drew take my boat . Bobby and I will load everything we can in the other one . We 'll try to keep up with you , but it 'll be better if you lead off , so we can see you if you get into trouble .  --  84  --  I hate to tell you , but from what little I know , we have n't hit the rough part of this river yet . &nbsp; BOBBYThe part that was going to be fun . &nbsp; LEWIS ( calmly , and looking deliberately at BOBBY ) The part that 's going to knock your stupid brains out if you do n't do exactly what I tell you to do . Now come on ; let 's take whatever else we can carry . You want out of this , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green canoe , where LEWIS packs it and stows it quickly . Shot of LEWIS and ED meeting on bank between canoes . &nbsp; EDTake everything , if you can take it , Lewis . If Drew and I have to go through those damned rapids first , I want a boat I can at least halfway handle . And I do n't want things wrapping around me in the water , if we spill . &nbsp; LEWISI do n't blame you . We 'll take all we can . &nbsp; EDAll I want is a weapon . I 'll take my bow . &nbsp; LEWIS ( seriously , with expertise ) I 'd think twice about that . If you think tents can be bad , you wait 'll those bare broadheads gore you a few times when you 're in white water with ' em . &nbsp; ED ( his mind made up ) I 'll take it anyway . ( he pauses ) And I sure wish we still had that guy 's gun . Why the hell did we leave it with him ? &nbsp; LEWISThe gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have got rid of it later . &nbsp; LEWISNo , too risky . ( LEWIS makes a gesture with his hands , indicating distance-measuring ) Every mile we carried that shotgun with us would increase the danger of our being caught with it . That could be the thing , buddy . That could be the thing . pp. 50-62 &nbsp; pp. 85-110 AT LAST THERE IS NO MORE RELOADING TO DO At last there is no more reloading to do , and the four men stand for a moment on the bank together , before , at a gesture from LEWIS , DREW and ED get into the aluminum canoe , DREW in front . Brief shot of DREW picking up the paddle , shaking his head at a situation he finds absolutely beyond belief . ED gets into the stern of the canoe , and we see them shove off and begin to get into the current .  --  85  --  Shots of the canoe gliding along . What we need to convey here is the sense of heightened sensibility  --  based on terror  --  that ED has here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with camera work , showing objects as being more vivid and more light-filled and unexpected than they have yet been on the journey . We now have several shots of the lead canoe , one or two of the canoe LEWIS and BOBBY are in as ED looks back to check on it , and one or two of both canoes . During this sequence we want to show how the land rises on both sides of the river , unobtrusively but definitely . The audience should have the feeling that the banks are rising on either hand , but not abruptly . In other words , I 'd like to convey the sensation of going into a gorge little by little , so that one hardly knows that it is happening . During this period of entering the gorge , we should gradually vary and intensify the sound of the river , until it takes on a kind of reverberating tone . We see ED try to speak to DREW and not be able to get through to him . The sound of the river as it comes back off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the human voice at all , even when it shouts its loudest . We do n't have a good look at the walls of the gorge until the canoes are well into it . Now we see ED glance to his left , and his gaze travels up the wall awesomely , higher and higher , until we see that the gorge is at least a hundred and fifty feet high , or maybe even higher . We see ED looking apprehensively at this , all the time in the tremendous sound of the reverberating water . The river is beginning to fall more abruptly now . There are more rapids and more rocks . ED and DREW are working hard to keep the canoe going straight , and we see various shots of them doing this , covered with spray and foam , the canoe pitching and bucking . They come into a comparatively calm stretch between rapids , and go around a turn . Now we see , as DREW swings across the camera , what ED sees : a long stretch of very rough water ahead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awfully rough ; too rough . &nbsp; ED ( screaming at the top of his lungs ) Let 's go right down the middle . Give me some speed , baby ! The camera moves forward from ED to DREW 's back . Something happens to DREW ; it is impossible to tell what . He shakes his head violently ( but this might just be the canoe bumping on a rock , or the camera shaking ) , and his paddle is whirled out of his hand  --  86  --  by the river . I will leave it to the cameraman and the director as to whether we should render this in slow-motion ( with maybe a brief stop-action shot with the canoe half turned-over , past help ) or whether we make it happen so fast that no one is sure what on earth has happened . But the net effect is that something has occurred , that it has occurred in some sort of relation to DREW , and that the canoe is out of control and overturning because of it . A quick , almost subliminal shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go his paddle and grabbing for the bow at his feet . The next thing we know , we and the camera are in the river , turning over and over , banging on stones , sometimes out of the water and sometimes under it , rushing along with unbelievable force . On one of the confused , confusing , topsy-turvy shots , we are facing upriver , and the canoe with LEWIS and BOBBY in it drives right over the camera , and we see someone fending off the camera  --  and ED  --  with a paddle , as though fending off a rock .  --  87  --  The camera is now nothing but swirling , tremendous water . We also hear two other sounds , in addition to the river sound . One of these is an almost-drowned-out but still recognizable human voice , gurgling and trying to say something , and the other is the bell-like tone of the aluminum canoe as it strikes on the stones . We also see , in another brief flash from the surface of the river , the green canoe rise up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another quick , subliminal shot of the two canoes rolling over and over each other like logs , until the green canoe bursts open on a rock . We now see ED struggling desperately with the water , trying to get his feet forward of him . After several attempts , he succeeds . His body elongates in the river , his feet show in the white water , we see that he has the bow , and he begins to slither over moss-covered rocks on his back . He hits the back of his head on one big rock , but then seems to get the hang of it . There is a curious look of pained pleasure on his face as he slides along , still alive . We see what ED sees from the exact level of the tossing water-surface . The last of the rapids are ahead ,  --  88  --  and the camera goes over them with ED : over a last big rock and down into calm water . Long shot of ED floating , cradling the bow , in the slow water below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the aftermath of the furious white water , down between the enormous wings of the gorge sides . A closer shot of ED in the water , lying back in his life jacket as though on a bed . He is groggily trying to assess his situation . He grimaces with pain , and then lifts his left hand out of the water . We see that he has hold of the arrows in the bow quiver by the arrowheads themselves . He lets go , and we see that his palm is washed with blood . Shots of ED clumsily trying to rearrange himself in the water : trying to get into position to look upstream at the last of the rapids he 's just come down , trying to look for the others . We keep looking at the last rocks of the rapids , and not seeing anything . A man flops over the rocks of the white water , completely out of control , and we recognize , after a bit , that it is BOBBY . Shot of ED pointing to the bank , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We now watch the rapids again , and soon LEWIS comes out of them , one hand holding his paddle and the other over his face . Shot of ED working through the water to get to LEWIS . We see LEWIS writhing and twisting in the water . &nbsp; LEWIS ( against the river sound ) My leg 's broke . It feels like it broke off . &nbsp; EDHold on to me . Shot of LEWIS getting hold of ED 's life jacket or collar , and of ED struggling to get both of them to the bank . View from ED 's position as he works to get them to where BOBBY is waiting . From the surface of the water ED looks up  --  the camera looks up  --  and travels up the enormous rock face rising from the river . If we are able , I 'd like to make this look at least a little something like the great face of the drive-in movie screen the party passed when they were first leaving the city .  --  89  --  ED and LEWIS reach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are now aware that it is almost dark . There is very little visibility . Shot of LEWIS on land , crow-hopping and getting himself onto a big rock , where he collapses . ED goes to him and tries to make him comfortable . LEWIS is still holding onto his face with a hand , his pain obviously all but intolerable . ED bends down to him , for it appears as though LEWIS is trying to say something . We ca n't get this at first , and then , as LEWIS keeps trying , we do . &nbsp; LEWIS ( against the ever-present river sound ) Drew was shot . I saw it . He 's dead . Shot of ED 's face as he digests this . &nbsp; EDI 'm not sure . Something happened to him . But I do n't know . I do n't know . &nbsp; ED ( to BOBBY now , who is standing above him ) Get his pants off him and see if you can tell how bad he 's hurt . I 've got to get that goddamned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ED moving back to the water . He glances once , apprehensively , up the cliffside , but it is getting  --  90  --  very dark now , and he apparently takes confidence from that . He launches himself back out into the water . We see again from ED 's angle of vision . The aluminum canoe is there , all right , half-buried in the water , swinging slowly around in a circle , going downstream aimlessly . We swim with ED toward the canoe . We find half a broken canoe paddle  --  the blade half  --  and we see ED get hold of it and appropriate it . We are now at the canoe , and we see ED struggle to try to get the water out of it . At last he succeeds , at least to some extent , and the camera watches him work the canoe back over to the bank where BOBBY is waiting , an ill-defined silhouette of a man . Shot of ED getting out of the water and moving back where LEWIS is now down off the rock and lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with ED , at LEWIS 's leg , and we can see that something is terribly wrong with it , though in the half-light we ca n't tell exactly what : it just looks misshapen and badly crooked , particularly in the upper part . &nbsp; ED ( as quietly as can be heard against the water ) Hold on , Lew . We 're all right now . ED turns and motions to BOBBY . BOBBY crouches down beside ED . &nbsp; BOBBYWhere is Drew ? &nbsp; EDLewis says he 's dead . Probably he is . He may have been shot . But I ca n't really say . I was looking right at him , but I ca n't say . &nbsp; BOBBY ( asking the inevitable and necessary question ) What are we going to do ? &nbsp; ED ( slowly , and amazed at himself for saying it ) I think ... that we 'll never get out of this gorge alive . &nbsp; BOBBYDo you ? ... &nbsp; EDI think he means to pick the rest of us off tomorrow .  --  91  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Would n't you ? &nbsp; BOBBYI do n't ... &nbsp; EDIf Lewis is right , and I think he is , that toothless bastard drew down on us while we were lining up to go through the rapids , and before we were going too fast . He killed the first man in the first boat . Next would have been me . Then you . &nbsp; BOBBYIn other words , it 's lucky we spilled . &nbsp; EDRight . Lucky . Very lucky . They stand together without saying anything for a moment . &nbsp; BOBBYWhat are we going to do ? &nbsp; EDThe question is , what is he going to do ? BOBBY does n't answer , and ED goes on . &nbsp; EDWhat can he lose now ? He 's got exactly the same thing going for him that we had going for us when we buried his buddy back in the woods . There wo n't be any witnesses . There 's no motive to trace him by . As far as anybody else knows , he 's never seen us and we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this gorge , would be awfully hard : more or less impossible . I doubt if even a helicopter could get down here , and if it did , what good would it do ? No ; there might be an investigation , but you can bet nothing will come of it . This is a wild goddamned river , as you might know , ( speaking very definitely ) What is going to happen to us , if he kills us , is that we are going to become a legend : you know : one of those unsolved things . &nbsp; BOBBY ( looking upward apprehensively ) You think he 's up there ? Do you really ? &nbsp; EDI 'm thinking we better believe he 's up there . &nbsp; BOBBYBut then what ? &nbsp; EDWe 're caught in this gorge . He ca n't come down here , but the only way out of this place for us is down the river . We ca n't run out of here at night , and when we move in the morning he 'll be up there somewhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Jesus Christ Almighty . &nbsp; EDYes , you might say that . &nbsp; BOBBYBut listen , Ed . You got to be sure . &nbsp; EDSure of what ? &nbsp; BOBBYSure you 're right . I mean , we may not really be in any danger from ... from ... &nbsp; EDYou want to take a chance ? If he 's up there , and we just wait here until morning and start out , it 'll be too late . &nbsp; BOBBYWhat can we do ? &nbsp; EDWe can do one of three things . We can do nothing , and hope he 's either gone away or was never there in the first place . Or we can pray for rain , to cut down the visibility . But if we got rain , we could n't get out through it , and Lewis would probably die of exposure . Anyway , it 's not going to rain . It 's a clear , clean night . &nbsp; BOBBYWhat 's the other thing ? &nbsp; EDSomebody can try to go up there and wait for him on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's like the movies on Saturday afternoon . It 's either him or us . We 've killed a man . So has he . Whoever gets out depends on who kills who . It 's just that simple . &nbsp; BOBBY ( after hesitating ) Well , all right . I do n't want to die . &nbsp; EDIf you do n't , help me figure . We 've got to figure like he 's figuring , up there . Everything depends on it . &nbsp; BOBBYI do n't have any idea what he 's figuring . &nbsp; EDWe can start out with the assumption that he 's going to try to kill us . &nbsp; BOBBYI got that far .  --  93  --  &nbsp; EDThe next thing is when . He ca n't do anything until it gets light . So that means we 've got till morning to do whatever we 're going to do . &nbsp; BOBBYI still do n't know what that is . &nbsp; ED ( impatiently ) Just let me go on a minute . My feeling is this . I would bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned over . I 'd also be willing to bet that he 's not fool enough to believe the rest of us drowned . He 's going to want to make sure of the other three . Also , he might have seen that one of the canoes is still around , though maybe he does n't ; I ca n't tell that . I think that the reason he did n't nail the rest of us was that by the time we got down here we 'd been carried a good ways past him . That 's our good luck ; it means we 've got at least a couple of advantages , if we can figure how to work them . &nbsp; BOBBY ( incredulously ) Advantages ? Some advantages . We 've got a hurt man . We 've got a waterlogged canoe with the bottom stove in . We 've got two guys who do n't know the first thing about the woods , who do n't even know where in the hell they are . He knows where we are , because we ca n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion of where he is , or even who he is . We have n't got a goddamned chance , if you and Lewis are right . If he 's up there and wants to kill us , he can kill us . &nbsp; ED ( with a certain confidence it is good to hear ) Well now , it has n't happened yet . And we 've got one big card . &nbsp; BOBBYWhat ? &nbsp; EDHe thinks we ca n't get at him . And if we can , we can kill him . &nbsp; BOBBYHow ? &nbsp; EDWith either a knife or a bow . Or with bare hands , if we have to . &nbsp; BOBBYWe ? &nbsp; EDNo . One of us . &nbsp; BOBBY ( making a gesture of pure helplessness ) I ca n't even shoot a bow . &nbsp; EDThen that makes it simple , does n't it ? See what I mean about solving our problems ? If you just do a little figuring.  --  94  --  &nbsp; BOBBY ( reaching out a hand and catching ED 's arm compulsively ) Ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get up there in the dark ? &nbsp; EDTo tell you the truth , I do n't . But we have n't got any other choice . Now shut up and let me think some more . They stand together in silence again , ED with his hands on his hips , looking around , looking up the gorge side , pondering . We also see LEWIS writhing on the ground under them , and hear a couple of muffled groans of agony from him . &nbsp; ED ( very decisively ) Bobby , here 's what I want you to do . Listen very , very carefully , because I 'm going to make you give it back to me before I leave . The whole thing is going to have to be done right , and done right the first time . &nbsp; BOBBYAll right , I 'm listening . &nbsp; EDKeep Lewis as warm and comfortable as you can . When it gets light  --  and I mean just barely light  --  get Lewis into the canoe and start out . The whole business is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you going to do ? I mean , how will you find ? ... &nbsp; EDIf I get up there , I 'm going to do just exactly what I would do if I was him . You 've got some rapids down below here , and he wo n't want to shoot at you when you 're jumping and bobbing up and down . If he 's coming , he 'll be at the first stretch of calm water , where he can take his time about drawing a bead and setting up his shots . You 'll be going slow there . So I 'm going to find that stretch of water , and wait for him . I 'm going to try to get him to come to me . ED walks over and gets the bow , and strings it . He takes out one of the two arrows , tests it for straightness , then does the same with the other . &nbsp; EDI 've got one good arrow and another one that 's crooked as a pretzel . But I wo n't get but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't do it . You 're using me up as a decoy . I 'll be a sitting duck out there . &nbsp; ED ( with murderous exasperation ) Listen , you son of a bitch . If you want to go up that cliff , you go  --  95  --  right ahead ; there is is . But if I go up we 're going to play this my way . And I swear to God that if you do n't do what I tell you I 'll kill you myself . Is that clear ? And if you leave Lewis on this rock I 'll do the same thing . &nbsp; BOBBYEd , I 'm not going to leave him . You know I would n't do that . I just do n't want to set myself up to be killed . That 's all . &nbsp; EDListen . I 'll do everything I can to see that he does n't crack down on you . We 've got to gamble . Lewis would do it . Now I 'm going to have to . Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ED crouches down beside LEWIS , who is grinding the back of his head into the sand , in pain . &nbsp; LEWIS ( looking straight into ED 's face ) Do you know what the fuck you 're doing ? &nbsp; EDNo , creature . I 'm going to make it up as I go along . &nbsp; LEWIS ( with terrifying intensity ) Kill him . &nbsp; ED ( nodding gravely ) I 'll kill him if I can find him . &nbsp; LEWIS ( lying back once more ) Well , here we are , at the heart of the Lewis Medlock country . &nbsp; ED ( rising ) Pure survival . &nbsp; LEWISThis is what it comes to . I told you . &nbsp; ED ( getting ready to set out ) Yes . You told me . Section Details WE NOW SEE ED GETTING HIMSELF SET TO TRY TO CLIMB THE CLIFF We now see ED getting himself set to try to climb the cliff . We see him recoil the nylon rope and put his left arm between the bowstring and the bow , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one last time , then runs hard at it , scrambles , pulls up , and works himself up onto a little ledge about twelve or fifteen feet above the river . He turns around and stands there , looking out over the water . We now see what ED sees : the whole scene : the river , the moon rising , the last of the rapids they have come down on the right , the rapids farther downstream . The effect we want here is that of a man entirely and utterly alone in the universe . He stands watching this for a moment or two  --  or three  --  and we watch with  --  96  --  him , listening to the river sound , which seems to have increased since the last of the dialogue . We now get into the long sequence of the climb itself , as ED turns back to the cliff , tries some hand and foot positions , and begins to inch up . The cliff does not seem to be quite as steep as we  --  and ED  --  first thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We see ED 's hands groping , finding holds , his feet doing the same . We see his face in the moonlight , sweating , and we hear his harsh , irregular breathing , and also a strange kind of muttering to himself he is doing , of which we can catch only a word now and then . This should be a long , agonizing sequence , and I will leave it to the director and the cameraman as how best to convey what I want conveyed by it . The general effect is this . The audience should progress with ED not only inch by inch up the cliff , but should increase in confidence with him too , little by little as he finds that he can make his way up , at least to the point where he presently happens to be . We should also have an occasional shot taken from above him , to show him poised over the bright pit of the river with the risen moon on it . He keeps going up , and it should be made obvious that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is getting steeper as it gets higher . He is beginning to labor and strain for every inch , and his breathing begins to sound more and more desperate . Now he reaches an absolute impasse : he ca n't go up any farther and he ca n't go down ( we see him try ) . He ca n't go to the right or to the left . We should show him absolutely crucified on this cliff , terrified and helpless . There is absolutely nothing he can do , and we should convey this with a terrible authority . He looks down , over his shoulder . There is the bright moon-pit , and it must be a hundred and fifty feet below him . He turns back to the cliff , leaning his face against it , sobbing , all control just about gone . Close-up of ED 's face , as a look of wild determination comes over it . Suddenly he makes a lunge at the cliff  --  up the cliff  --  and we see his hand catch on something . He gets hold of something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again in wild hope : the last hope of all . ED pulls up , and gets himself into a kind of narrow crevice , or niche , in the cliff . In doing this he almost loses the bow , but manages just barely to save it . He stretches out on the floor of the niche ,  --  97  --  breathing heavily , and is perfectly still . We see his face as though he were lying in a coffin , except that he is sweating so heavily . We do nothing now but look at his face and listen to him breathe . After a while he props up on one elbow and looks over the side of the crevice , down at the river . He lies there stroking the curves of the bow , looking down at the wild , Godlike and mindless beauty of the river on fire with moonlight . &nbsp; ED ( mumbling profoundly ) What a view . What a view . He lies watching , and we watch with him . Nothing happens for a while . Then we might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model in the studio : just her face , superimposed on the river . From the little we are able to tell , she is looking inviting and enigmatic , as mysterious as the river and the wilderness itself . Then she is gone , and we are not sure we have seen her at all . Slowly ED begins to feel the crevice above his head , and to feel around the top of it , to see what 's there . Painfully he begins to get himself together once more : he gets ready to climb .  --  98  --  We see ED get a hold  --  a fairly good hold  --  on something and drag himself upward out of the crevice . There are a good many shots of his hands groping over the stone , and we should be given the idea , from this , that he is becoming almost infinitely more sensitive to the feel of things than he 's been before . And it is by this process of increased sensitivity to objects  --  that is , to the world  --  that he rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exaltation . Cut to Shot of LEWIS and BOBBY at the river 's edge . LEWIS is moaning softly , and BOBBY just sits looking hopelessly out on the indifferent water . Cut back to ED , as he rises higher and higher . We see him from above once more , and he is so high over the river that the scene is both awesome and ridiculous . He is still inching up , and up , and up . We now begin to notice that the cliff is not as steep as it was : things are going better . ED can almost crawl on his knees now . He slithers and wriggles upward , and the sound of his breath is like that of a man who sees that he might after all be able to do what he 's trying to do : might be able to do it , and probably will . There is a kind of rage of incredible belief and joy in ED 's breathing : it is almost bestial . He looks up , and the enormously intense moon is right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rock . We see him make for the crack , get into it , rise from his knees , stumble forward among rocks and bushes , still sobbing with relief . We watch this for a while . Cut to Shot over ED 's shoulder , as he stands on the top of the cliff looking down at the enormous mindless blazing of the moonlit river . He has made it , and his attitude as he stands there is not completely mortal or even human . It is more Godlike , or demonic . But it is not quite the face he 's had before , at all . Now we see him check his equipment  --  the bow , the arrows , the knife , the rope  --  and be more or less satisfied with what he 's got .  --  99  --  He begins to make his way downriver through the trees and bushes and grass that grow along the clifftop ; he is confident and cautious . Though he stumbles and falls a few times , he is not in any immediate danger now . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this time he is above falls . This should be obvious , so that the audience remembers what he has told BOBBY of his plans to ambush the TALL MAN below the next set of falls , over calm water . He begins to make his way downstream once more , checking the river often . We notice the sound of the river over the falls is louder than it was where ED climbed . We see ED crawl over rocks , and we convey the impression that it is pretty tough going to get downstream . But he makes it , over obstacle after obstacle : rocks , down timber , holes , everything that 's there . ED comes very slowly over a big boulder , and we find him standing in a kind of small open space at the edge of the cliff . He looks down , and we with him . All of us can tell that ED is now below the rapids . Close-up of ED 's face , and we see that his head has a slight nodding motion : he figures that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time we see ED move about in this little open space , the audience should be aware that he is not aware that he 's making marks and tracks all over the place . He 's thinking of something else , and is n't concerned about where he 's putting his feet . As will be shown later , this is going to cost him , and almost cost him his life . ED gets down at the very edge of the cliff in the prone position for firing a rifle . He picks up something  --  a long stick  --  and sights down it onto the river as he would do a rifle . He is firing through a screen of high grass at the edge , and we watch him really concentrate on this , as if the stick were indeed a gun . We look down the stick  --  a fairly straight stick , but very obviously a stick  --  onto the river . We can see the last of the falls , and we can also see that we 're shooting down onto calm water . Slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man drawing a long bead , leading his target just enough , making very sure of his shot .  --  100  --  We now see ED get back to his feet , throw the stick aside , and get his bow where he has leaned it on a tree . He looks at the river again , and nods once more , and this time the nod is a lot more definitely a nod than the first one was . He looks around move . The woods are very thick just back off the little open space he 's in . He goes back into them , and we see his shadow moving among the boles and the tree darkness . ED is now standing at the base of a tree with his hand on it . He leans the bow against the tree and starts to climb , with much labored movement , a few slips , and much pushing of branches and pine needles out of his face with one hand . He is now close to the top of the tree . We know this because we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now of ED adjusting the position of his body , his feet , his hands . When he is satisfied with these , he opens the pine branches slowly with one hand , and we see with him that the little open space , the sandy shelf , is below him and about fifteen yards away . ED 's movement to disclose the sandy shelf should be almost identical with the movement of LEWIS when he set aside the willow branches to reveal the river for the first time . We look at the sandy shelf and listen to the distant sound of the river , as ED slowly allows the branches and needles to swing back in and close off the view once more . Shots of ED climbing back down the tree , getting the bow , and painfully climbing back up to where he was . He opens the boughs and looks down on the sandy shelf again , and this time he breaks one of them off , so that he can see the shelf partially without holding the branches . We see him continue to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on is revealed bit by bit . We now see ED take the bow from the limb he 's hung it on , put an arrow on the string , get himself set , and come back to full draw . He does this two or three times until he 's satisfied . He then hangs the bow back on the limb and tries to get comfortable in the tree to wait for first light . Shots of the tree from " outside " it , showing just the tree and not ED : it looks like any other tree in the vicinity . We prowl slowly around the tree with the camera , and come at last to just that angle at which we can see up the little tunnel ED has made to shoot down ; through this we can see ED , and it should be  --  101  --  made clear that it is only at this position on the ground , only at this angle , that he can be seen . Various shots of the top of the cliff , of the distant river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a wild , isolated place , and as we look at different things and objects there  --  rocks , bushes , leaves , and so on  --  we gradually notice that we can see them better . The light is coming . Full shot of trees , river and clifftop , and this shot is in the tired gray light of a woods dawn . The scene looks like a photographic negative gradually coming clear in its chemical bath . We now see ED in the tree . He is dozing , with his head back against the bole . The bow hangs beside his head , and a little light glints murderously on the two arrowheads . Suddenly ED starts , almost falls , catches himself and looks around with exhausted eyes . But he is awake enough to know that the sun is just beginning to appear . He shakes his head like a boxer trying to shake off a punch , then gets the bow off the limb and sits there holding it . He takes his one good arrow off the bow quiver and puts it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limbs and pine needles . We see him do this for a while , and during this time it slowly gets more and more light . ED peers this way and that , trying to see a little more . We see him blink his eyes like a man who has n't had anywhere near enough sleep . He looks down once more into the sandy shelf . There is a pair of feet  --  boots  --  standing on the shelf , barely inside ED 's range of vision . Shot of ED 's face in pure terror . He keeps looking , and the feet on the ground move until most of a whole man passes through ED 's line of sight and then out of it to the other , upriver , side . But we have seen enough to know that the man is carrying a rifle . ED cranes to see the man , but as we look down on the sandy shelf , we ca n't make him out either . Then the feet appear on the other side of the tunnel of branches , stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it and stop . What we can see of the man indicates that he is looking at the ground , examining it , maybe , ED 's tracks , of course , are what he 's looking at . We now see ED getting ready to shoot . Inch by inch he levels the bow , then slowly pulls back the string .  --  102  --  We now shift the camera into ED 's position  --  that is , into ED  --  and see just what he sees and no more . The vertical rectangle of the peep sight on the string wavers back to the camera  --  to the eye  --  just as it did in the scene in the fog where ED earlier hunted the deer . We should draw this scene out excruciatingly . As we sight through the peep sight , we see that the man is not framed . We adjust the peep sight up and down , right and left , until little by little in the trembling peep sight , the man is framed . Then with a shock we notice what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his eyes are following ED 's track straight to the tree . They reach the tree , and slowly begin to rise from the ground . At this point the peep sight snaps away from the camera , and at the same time we hear the bow twang . An instantaneous shot of ED 's face , in mixed amazement and triumph , and then hell indeed breaks loose . The whole tree shakes violently , as though an ax had struck it  --  a giant ax  --  and at the same time there is a tremendous explosion , as the gun goes off in what had been utter silent concentration . What happens next it is impossible to be sure about , and the camera should see to it that this is the impression . I would not be at all averse simply to pitching the camera out of the tree . It is evident that ED is falling ; we see the limbs whirl about him , we hear him cry out involuntarily , and then we convey the sense of his hitting the ground with a terrific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gun is firing shot after tremendous , shattering shot . We now see ED on the ground without his bow , trying to get himself together , not knowing quite what has happened , shaken , terrified . He begins to try to crawl , to get to his feet . He cries out in pain once , startlingly , and we think that maybe he 's discovering that he 's broken a leg , a rib , or something else . We see him as he makes his way behind some big boulders and lies down on the upriver side of one of them . Slowly , cautiously , he raises his head . Shot of man with gun staggering , toward the tree ED was in , firing at the tree , up into the tree , into the ground just in front of his feet . Then , as he gets nearer the tree and turns a little , we can see the arrow coming almost all the way out the back of him , just below throat level . From all we can tell ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chest or the bottom of the throat . ED puts his head down on the rock and is very still for a moment , and then raises it to look once more . This time we see the man down on his knees , with the arrow waggling horribly behind him . He is retching blood  --  we see him from behind  --  and the violence of his retching shakes the arrow loose , and it falls from him . ED watches in open-mouthed fascination . &nbsp; EDDie ! My God , die , die ! ED puts his head back down on the rock and is still , apparently unconscious . Then we see he is not . He slowly raises himself to do something , but this time it is not to look at the dying man , but at himself . Grim , awesome shot of ED 's side , and it has an arrow sticking through it . Move the camera to show , still attached to the arrow by the lower part of the bow quiver , the broken bow . This should convey that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crooked one . ED puts his head down once more , trying to organize himself , to find what to do . Finally he pulls himself to a sitting position and cautiously , with great , obvious pain , tries to pull the arrow out of his side . He ca n't , and he sees he ca n't . With great effort he pulls the big knife out of the scabbard  --  the arrow is in his left side  --  and cuts away the material from the flying suit he 's wearing from around the arrow . He tries in a gingerly way to cut the arrow out . Then he seizes the knife in both hands and drives it down . He explodes in a scream  --  something like BOBBY 's in the rape scene  --  and we hear the knife fall and ring on the stone . Once more he reaches down to his side , and this time , in some way , he comes away with the arrow . He sits for a moment with the bloody shaft in his hands , like a religious object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed . Now he looks over the rock again onto the sandy shelf . We swing the camera and discover that there is no one there . Now ED comes down off the rock , painfully , protecting his hurt side . He picks up the bloody knife , and ,  --  104  --  with a great deal of awkwardness and effort , cuts a sleeve off his outfit and a long strip from one leg , and puts the sleeve over the wound as a bandage and binds it with the strip of nylon from the leg . He is a weird-looking figure when this has been done . We see him slowly move out onto the sandy shelf . He goes to the place where the man was , and stands looking down , swaying and thinking . ED gets down on one knee , wincing with pain , and runs his hand over the rocks and sand . He picks up a handful of sand with blood in it and riffles through it like a placer miner examining gold dust . We now see him on his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camera shows where the blood is as he looks for it and finds it : on stones , on pine needles , on blades of grass . The camera shifts into ED 's view and follows the blood , rock by rock : the camera gets down on its knees , and follows the blood spoor like a dog would . We hear ED 's breathing during this sequence , harsh and irregular , changing when a new drop or smear of blood is found . We do this for a while , stone by stone , leaf by leaf , irregularly , stopping sometimes to search , then finding the blood again and going on . What is happening during this sequence is that we are preparing to go into the woods just like this : at dog level . We look for the next drop of blood . But what we find , just under our eyes , is the rifle . A good long look at the rifle , long and flat and old . Oddly , it is a repeating rifle rather than a shuck-action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly enveloped in leaves . Here , it is harder to find the blood , and we hear this frustration in ED 's breath . We look at bushes , we look at the leaves on bushes individually , we look at pine straw , we look at small pebbles . We look back and forth . Finally we find one drop , and this one drop draws us farther on , deeper in . We and the camera raise our eyes from the ground , and there is a clearing in front of us . The camera rises from dog level , as ED is doing . We now see ED , standing there swaying , not knowing what to do . The camera sweeps back and forth across  --  105  --  this pine clearing we are looking at , but not picking out anything but the woods themselves . ED starts around the perimeter of the clearing , going to the right , or what would be downriver . He is still staggering , but learning to hold himself together a little better , learning to cope with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we with him . The sun is slanting and shuddering on the ground around him , and we hear the wind in the branches overhead . He goes along through this modified cathedral atmosphere , looking for more blood , holding his side together , holding his own blood in . He stops , peering . The camera goes to see what he sees , and comes on a rock that looks like one side of it has been painted red . Zoom in slowly on the rock : what has made it red is blood : it could n't be anything else , being so bright in these dull , dusty woods . We see the expression on ED 's face as he starts forward : it is full of hope and something else : whatever the actor and the director want to put there . ED gets to the rock and looks around . Again the camera goes forward to see what he sees . There is a dead tree about twenty yards away , and something is bunched and lying at the foot of it . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him onto the body of a man . He has hold of one root of the tree . ED turns him over with a foot . He has a hand on his knife . He pulls the knife slowly and purposefully out of the case , and bends down . Another scream comes from him : a terrible scream of frustration and horror . &nbsp; EDOh no ! Oh NO ! The camera looks down onto the man 's face , and the first thing we notice about it is that it is full of yellow teeth . Shaken and fascinated , ED gets down on one knee with the knife in his hand . Shuddering , he holds the man 's head and pries at his upper gum with the knife , and we can plainly see that an upper plate begins to slide from it . As soon as this is established , we see  --  106  --  ED turn the knife and drive , tapping with the handle , the false teeth back into the mouth . ED takes the knife into his hand again . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balanced between infinite possibilities : the audience can not possibly know what ED is going to do , what has come into his mind : he could do anything . We hear ED 's breath again , harsh and loud . Into the breath comes some kind of crazy melody , maybe something of the Beatles : something identifiable . There is also some suggestion of an advertising jingle : one of those inescapable tunes from our daily life . &nbsp; EDKing Size Coke has more for you  - -  King Size Coke has more for you  --  We see ED 's eyes , and they are truly maniacal , as he continues to sing and hum crazily . Shaken by his own incipient violence , ED fumbles to put the knife back into the case . He does , and takes hold of the man and tries to get him up on his shoulders in the old fireman 's carry from Boy Scout days . Finally he gets up with the man , and starts back through the cathedral woods , with the wind blowing lightly through the trees and the sunspots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright : early morning and early autumn . Several shots of ED staggering through the bushes with the man on his back . He is barely making it , but he is making it . They tear through the small boughs of rhododendrons . Finally they break through the last screen of the woods and move slowly back into the clearing . We see ED put the MAN down at almost the exact spot where he shot him . ED now goes and gets the rifle , and then the two bloody arrows . Shot of the dead man with his bloody throat and the rifle and arrows , all lying on the ground as if in an arrangement , a composition , a layout . ED now moves to the edge of the cliff . His gaze and the camera sweep downstream , and there is nothing but river . We now move with them upstream and discover , just coming out of the rapids , a canoe . &nbsp; EDBobby , you dumb son of a bitch . I said first light ! You did n't start on time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ought to ...  --  107  --  On impulse ED moves quickly and gets the rifle and goes back over to the edge of the cliff . His fury is so great it is unbelievable , either to ED or to us . Wildly he swings the rifle to his shoulder , and we see what he sees as he puts the bead right onto BOBBY . We hold the view trembling there , waiting for the shot . It does n't come . ED drops the rifle , scarcely daring to believe what he 's just been about to do . &nbsp; ED ( in utter disbelief at himself ) Oh . Oh ! ED now takes the rifle by the barrel , swinging it twice around his head like a hammer-thrower , and slings it out over the river . We see it fall away , spinning . In a brief view from the canoe we see the rifle hit the water , about fifty yards in front of the canoe . BOBBY looks up , peering this way and that way . Now we see ED throwing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spears . He also by now has the broken bow , and he turns it over in his hands much as he did the arrow he fell on : like a religious object . We see his face as he does this , and there is the greatest affection in it : this is the thing that saved all their lives , but mainly his own life . Then the spell breaks , and ED steps deliberately to the clifftop and pitches the bow over the side . It falls away . Then he walks -- trudges rather -- to a big stone at the very edge of the cliff , where he will be in full sight of BOBBY , and clambers up onto it . View of ED on top of the rock . He is waving and trying to attract BOBBY 'S attention . We look down with the camera , and we ca n't tell whether BOBBY notices him or not . ED puts his fingers in his mouth and whistles , but we can tell that it does n't get through the river sound . &nbsp; ED ( as loudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumb asshole ! You goddamned country-club man ! Look up here ! I got you your stupid life ! You 're gon na live ! ED goes into a wild dance on the rock , and ends up in the old side-straddle hop from high-school PT and ROTC courses . His side is killing him , but he has to  --  108  --  dance , to get BOBBY to see him : see something unusual in motion , up there where the gun has come down from . As ED gesticulates wildly , we see the canoe turn slowly in to the bank under the cliff . ED stops dancing , and goes down and peers through a kind of crevice in the rock , and far down , so far that we can barely make out that this is happening , we see that BOBBY is looking up at him . The canoe is deliberately there , all right , and lies between rocks . ED now steps back beside the dead MAN and takes stock . He 's still got his knife and his rope , and he checks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is evident that he has quite a lot of it . We show a sequence now where ED ties the rope under the arms of the dead MAN and walks over and ties the other end to a tree growing at almost the very edge of the cliff . ED goes back to the body and hauls it to the edge of the cliff , takes up the slack in the rope with his hands , and kicks and shoves the body over the cliff with his feet .  --  109  --  Close shot of ED braced back and straining to let the body down , arm over arm . It goes hard . ED sweats and strains , tries to take a turn of rope around his body , finds he ca n't do it , lets the body down foot by foot . He backs up and braces himself against the tree , working harder than he 's ever worked in his life . Shot of coil of rope wearing slowly -- very slowly --  away at ED 's feet . Finally , at long last , all the rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to get his hands unclenched . He wrings his hands up and down like someone who 's touched a hot stove , trying to get the circulation back into them . He goes to the edge and looks down . &nbsp; ED ( deliberately aloud ) Well , one more time , I guess . We see ED get down on his knees at cliffside and take hold of the rope with both hands , one above the cliff edge and one below . &nbsp; EDThe name of the game is trust . You 've got to trust things .  --  110  --  He gets his feet over the edge and starts down , letting himself down hand over hand , and we follow him as he goes , straining and hurting , but going down well enough . He scrambles against the cliff face with his feet , finding footholds . The camera goes down with him , and it is evident that he is almost completely exhausted . A long shot or two showing the degree of his progress down the cliff . He goes down toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is almost there . Close shots of the parts of the cliff that are right in front of his eyes , staring back at him with pebbles and sand grains . These shots should be slightly out of focus to indicate their desperate proximity . In some of these the sand and dust stir and blow a little with ED 's breath . ED stops to rest on a little ledge . The corpse is about ten or fifteen feet under him , swinging moodily in the breeze from the river , spinning idly , knocking against the cliff face . ED sits , holding the rope . He is still about fifty feet up from the river , and he is evidently figuring what to do . From where he sits he can see BOBBY and the canoe well , and even LEWIS lying in the bottom of it . LEWIS 'S position is terribly twisted-looking and unnatural . He has his hand over his face . On the ledge , ED looks at his free hand , flexing the fingers . He slides off the ledge and starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost on top of the corpse . He hangs there for a moment , looking down , trying to figure what to do . pp. 63-84 &nbsp; pp. 111-126 SUDDENLY IT IS AS THOUGH THE FILM HAD BROKEN Suddenly it is as though the film had broken , but what has really happened is that the rope has broken . We have an instant of pure blackness , then we see large areas of green and blue turning haphazardly and idly , to signify sky and river as ED falls between them , turning in the air . We hear a muffled yell during this . The yell is suddenly cut off , and we are in another world . It is green and quiet , and it is to be understood that we are underwater . Cocked to one side of this pervading green is a suffused yellow area , and we gradually approach this . As we get closer to it , we see that it is something like a submerged sun , wavering and expanding . In fact , it is the sun , and it  --  111 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head comes clear of the water with a yell . Shot of ED feebly in the water , trying to discover if he 's been hurt even more , trying to move his arms and legs and discovering that he can do it . He begins , with infinite weariness and effort , to swim to the canoe . Shot of ED reaching the battered side of the canoe , standing up in the shallow water among the rocks , and looking over the gunwale into the bottom of the canoe . We see what ED sees : something dreadful . LEWIS is lying there , either dead or barely alive . The floor of the canoe is awash with filthy water , much of it containing stuff that LEWIS has vomited up . This is floating and softly sloshing around LEWIS 'S form . LEWIS turns his head , gives ED a long , serious look , then closes his eyes and settles back into the water and other stuff . ED , in a bone-tired and threatening posture , turns to face BOBBY . We can see BOBBY all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you call first light ? &nbsp; BOBBYListen . Lewis has been having a bad time . Once I thought he died . He 's awful bad hurt . &nbsp; EDYou would have died , yourself . He was waiting for you up there . You did n't do what I told you , and you would have died . He could have shot you fifty times . You better look up here at this light , baby . You better look at your hands and feet , because you liked not to 've had them any more . &nbsp; BOBBY ( pleading ) Listen . Please listen . I could n't get him in the canoe at all until I had enough light to see what I was doing . He blacked out two or three times before I ever got him in. ( pause ) I 'll tell you , I would n't want to spend another night like that . I would 've rather been trying to climb up , with you . &nbsp; ED ( ironically ) Fine . Next time , maybe . &nbsp; BOBBY ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought you could do it ; I never thought I 'd see you again . If it 'd been me I do n't know but what I 'd 've just taken off , if I'd'a been able to get to the top .  --  112  --  &nbsp; ED ( truthfully ) I thought about that . ( pause ) But I did n't . &nbsp; BOBBY ( in awed conviction ) You did exactly what you said you 'd do . But it 's not possible . I do n't believe it . I ca n't believe it . I really ca n't , Ed . This is not happening to us . &nbsp; EDWell , we 've got to make it unhappen . Question is , how ? &nbsp; BOBBY ( shaking his head ) I do n't know . Do you really think we can ? I mean , really ? &nbsp; EDI do really . With all this bad luck , luck is running with us . &nbsp; BOBBYAnd you killed him ? You killed him ? &nbsp; ED ( and we know that he means it ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only better . &nbsp; BOBBYWhat on earth did you do ? Did you ambush him ? &nbsp; EDIn a way . I did just about what I told you I was going to do , before I left . And what I figured then turned out to be right . He came right to me . Shot of ED and BOBBY walking over to where the dead man lies on the rocks , face down , with the rope piled on and off him . They turn him over , and we see two things about him , in a fleeting shot of his head : the face is smashed in , and there are some fragments of his dental plate on the rocks beside him . &nbsp; BOBBY ( looking up with incredulity ) Is this ? ... &nbsp; ED ( not absolutely sure , but fairly sure ) Yes . I think so . It 's got to be . He had a gun . &nbsp; BOBBYBut it might have been just a guy out ... &nbsp; EDHe was looking at the river an awful lot . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ; it 's got to be him . &nbsp; BOBBY ( changing the subject slightly ) It looks like you shot him from the front . How ? ... &nbsp; EDI did . I shot straight into him . I was in a tree . If I 'd missed him with my one arrow he would 've killed me . He shot a good many times , as it was . Did you hear anything ?  --  113  --  &nbsp; BOBBYMaybe once . I 'm not sure . Probably not ; it was just that I was listening so hard . But , no , I did n't hear anything . They stand looking down , dirty , ragged ( especially ED ) and exhausted . &nbsp; EDThere he is . Another one . &nbsp; BOBBY ( turning to ED , and this time we begin to like BOBBY , for he is genuinely concerned about ED 's injury , and in his actions and tone of voice and gestures we begin to feel some of the solicitude and caring that men in battle have for each other ) But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his flying suit and takes it down to the waist , and we get a good look at the makeshift bandaging he has done on himself . &nbsp; BOBBY ( bending to look , and gently untying the bandage ) Boy ! Something really got to you . &nbsp; ED ( resignedly ) I fell out of the tree onto my other arrow . ( pause ) I 'm sure glad I do n't use four-bladed heads . Shots in which ED takes off his shorts , and BOBBY tries to refashion the bandage , using the white shorts next to the wound and tying them in place with the sleeve ED has cut off . &nbsp; ED ( examining BOBBY 's work ) Let 's finish up and get going . They go back to the corpse , and ED bends down , getting the rope off and cutting some sections from it with his knife . ED stands up again . Two shot . &nbsp; BOBBYOne more time , Ed . Are you sure ? &nbsp; EDI 'm not as sure as I 'd like to be , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know is that we 're here , and so is he . Let 's get him in the river . Let 's get him in good . Shots of ED and BOBBY looking for appropriate rocks to sink the corpse in the river with . They pile rocks beside the body , and they cross each other several times in the process , sometimes looking at each other and sometimes not , going back and forth in strange duties .  --  114  --  Shots of ED and BOBBY tying big rocks onto the body , one of these around the neck , and then of the two of them working to get the rocks into the canoe and then the corpse . Finally they succeed , and get into the canoe themselves . The whole paddle is used by ED in the stern seat , and BOBBY has the blade of the broken paddle ED picked out of the water when he rescued the canoe below the falls where they first capsized . Shot of LEWIS lying alongside the dead man , and it is hard to tell which is dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; EDNot here . Out in the middle , where it 's hardest to get to . They make it slowly to the middle of the stream , which is fairly slow at this point . Shots of ED and BOBBY heaving out the rocks . This procedure is grotesque and terrifying , and also in a gruesome way funny , for the corpse does not seem to want to leave the canoe . It hangs spread-eagled on the gunwale . In a wild , desperate and abandoned movement , ED picks up the last and biggest rock , the one tied around the body 's neck , and with great effort , the last effort of all , heaves it out . The corpse is whisked with breathtaking quickness away and into the river . The canoe rocks softly . ED and BOBBY now begin to paddle , in a grotesque parody of canoeing . Long shot of the canoe moving along , and a long --  infinitely long -- curve that they painfully negotiate . The next should be one of the most striking shots of the film , for by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we watch it come out of the turn , seems to float upon pure liquid gold , pure light , and in this we see these two exhausted men . We have another shot of this , now from the side of the canoe as it rides on the sun , and ED and BOBBY are bent with exhaustion , barely able to sit upright . ED 's ragged clothing and sleeveless arm are particularly obvious . Many shots now of them paddling and drifting through wild , beautiful country . I will leave to the director as to how much time we want to spend here , but the general effect should be that this sequence , between the time when they sink the corpse and the time when they find DREW 's body , denotes a good deal of lapsed  --  115  --  time and distance traveled , and a further stage of exhaustion in the men . In this sequence we also want to contrast the wild , unvisited freedom and beauty of the country with the exhaustion and terror of the men . Several shots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , his hand over his face sometimes and sometimes not . Some of these we see from ED 's position . Finally they come around another turn , and before BOBBY swings in front of him to cut off ED 's view , we have a momentary but definite impression that there is a man , a body , facing the canoe from some of the river rocks downstream &nbsp; BOBBY ( turning , in disbelief and horror ) Ed ! &nbsp; ED ( quietly ) Is it Drew ? &nbsp; BOBBY ( sobbing ) Yes . Yes . &nbsp; EDLet 's go to him . We now see from BOBBY 's position as we approach DREW 's body , and as we get closer we can tell that it is sitting in a grotesque position in the rocks , as though in a kind of natural chair , the water flowing over him , propping his head back . Shot as the canoe reaches DREW 's body , and we can see that the body has its eyes wide open , gazing upstream as if forever . The canoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , which somehow should look at ED and BOBBY , does not . With infinite weariness , ED gets out of the canoe onto the rocks and the shallows around them . He walks the length of the canoe , and comes to BOBBY , who is sitting , holding his half-paddle , asleep . &nbsp; ED ( hitting BOBBY a vicious blow on the shoulder and putting his hand on the knife ) Do you hear me ? You help me with this or I 'll kill you , just as you sit there on your useless ass . Now come on . We 've got to finish it . BOBBY gets slowly out of the canoe , deliberately not looking at ED , who is still standing threateningly , thigh-deep in the river .  --  116  --  Shot of DREW as he sits there , uncaring , a stupid , water-caused , streaming grin on his face . He even looks happy , in a kind of weird , eternal way . ED tries to pull the body out of the rocks , and at first ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straps of its life jacket and hauls it forward . The effort makes ED trip , he flounders and falls into the river , and the corpse , freed , begins to float serenely away . Shot of the corpse floating , looking at the sky . Shot of ED floundering after the corpse , reaching it , getting it over to one of the rocks and beaching it . Close in as ED turns the corpse over , looking at it intently . We do n't see what he 's looking at yet . &nbsp; ED ( beckoning to BOBBY without looking in his direction ) Bobby , come here . There 's something we 've got to decide about . BOBBY reaches ED , and ED points down at something concerning the corpse . Shot of them both , hanging on the rock , panting and gasping . &nbsp; EDIs this a gunshot wound ? &nbsp; BOBBYEd , you know I would n't know . But it sure does n't look like it to me . &nbsp; ED ( evidently touching something on the corpse we ca n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the head . But whether this place killed him or not , I do n't know . &nbsp; BOBBYOr whether it was made by a rock , after he went in . &nbsp; EDI 'd like to know . I think we ought to know . &nbsp; BOBBYHow can we know ? &nbsp; EDLewis would come nearer knowing than we would . Let 's take Drew over to him and give him a good look . Shot of the two of them dragging DREW 's body to the gunwale of the canoe . They put DREW 's head up over the gunwale so that LEWIS can have a close look at the back and side of it .  --  117  --  ED sinks down until his head is exactly on the same level as DREW 's . &nbsp; ED softly ) Lewis . Shot of LEWIS either dead or sleeping or passed out . Hold shot of LEWIS as ED 's voice comes from offscreen . &nbsp; ED ( softly but urgently ) Lewis , give us just a second . It 's important . It 's very important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shot of ED holding DREW 's head in a gentle grasp , turning it slightly and with the other hand pointing to the place he wants LEWIS to look at . &nbsp; EDLewis , was he shot ? Did a bullet make this ? Shot of LEWIS , and a flicker of the old enthusiasm crosses his eyes and face . We can not tell what he 's thinking : he may be preparing to play one of his old games . He looks maniacal and wise . He knows something the others do n't . Or does he ? &nbsp; ED ( more urgently ) Well , was he shot ? Was he ? Was he , Lewis ?  --  118  --  Slowly LEWIS brings his eyes from DREW 's head to ED 's eyes , and stares into them . They stare at each other , and we hold the shot . Slowly and almost imperceptibly LEWIS nods his head . &nbsp; LEWIS ( softly , but with utter conviction ) Grazed . LEWIS sinks back into the bottom of the canoe . Two shot of ED and BOBBY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 'll have to be . ( then with resolution ) But we ca n't have anybody examining him . We ca n't tell , but there are those who can , and if we have to explain a man with a gunshot wound the whole thing 'll come out . &nbsp; BOBBY ( despairingly ) Are we going to get out of this ? I do n't see how we can . I really do n't . &nbsp; ED ( musing ) We 're almost out of it now . &nbsp; BOBBYWhat are we going to do with Drew ? &nbsp; EDWe 're going to sink him in this river . Forever . &nbsp; BOBBYO God . O God Almighty . &nbsp; EDListen . It 's exactly like I said . Exactly . We ca n't afford for somebody who knows about these things to examine him . If we go back without him , we just had some bad luck . We 're a fucking bunch of amateurs , anyway . And let ' em try to disprove that ! We came up here to run this river without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the God 's truth . We did all right for a while , then we spilled . Lewis broke his leg in the rapids , and Drew drowned . We lost the other canoe . Anybody 'd believe that . But we ca n't explain somebody killed with a rifle . &nbsp; BOBBYIf he was . &nbsp; EDThat 's right : if he was . &nbsp; BOBBY ( looking down into the river ) There 's no end to it . ( shaking his head ) No end . &nbsp; EDYes there is . This is the end . This is all we have to do , but we 've got to do it right . Everything depends on it . The whole works .  --  119  --  ED bends and fumbles in his leg pocket for the extra bowstring he 's brought along , and brings it out . He holds it in his hand momentarily , long enough for us to see that it contains a built-in peep sight such as the one on the string he used to kill the man with , except that this sight is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string around a big rock and the other end around DREW 's belt . He puts the rock in the canoe , and BOBBY gets back in . ED begins to float DREW 's body downriver in its kapok life jacket , going along beside the body in his own life jacket , swimming slowly . Shot of DREW floating faceup , his hands spread wide in the water . ED is very close to him , and we see him looking , as he swims , at one of DREW 's hands . Close-up of hand , and we notice two things about it . One is DREW 's college class ring , and the other is the guitar calluses on the tips of the fingers , now puckered with the water . ED feels these with his own hand . Shot of ED , either crying or choking on the river . &nbsp; ED ( loudly ; maybe a little too loudly ) You were the best of us , Drew . The only decent one . The only sane one . Shot of the canoe , where BOBBY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rope between the figures and the canoe . Shot of ED undoing DREW 's life jacket . He nods to BOBBY . Shot of BOBBY , on his knees beside LEWIS , heaving out the rock . Shot of the body being snatched under . Shot of ED swimming breaststroke alongside the canoe , as it floats on a pattern of light down to some more shallows . Shot of ED climbing wearily back into the rear seat and picking up the paddle , straightening the canoe out in the current , and going on , his head almost on his chest . More shots suggesting a long lapse of time and much distance traveled . We notice that there are no more cliffs or high banks ; that the land has pretty well  --  120  --  flattened out . The party is through the gorge country . More shots of the canoe sliding through river country . Section Details SHOT OF ED IN CANOE PUTTING DREW 'S LIFE JACKET ON Shot of ED in canoe putting DREW 's life jacket on over his own , to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's obvious that he 's grateful to have the collar of the extra life jacket keeping the sun off . Shots of ED in canoe , keeping himself awake by any means at his command , and shots of BOBBY just sitting slumped in the seat , completely out of it . &nbsp; ED ( desperately : somebody has to do it ; somebody has to say these things ) Bobby , hang on . If we can stay with it for ten miles we 'll be out . I know we will . We 've come an awful goddamned long way , and it ca n't be much longer . BOBBY seems to comprehend , but we ca n't really tell if he does or not . &nbsp; EDDo n't rock us . And if you see anything I ca n't see , tell me . If we hit any rapids , try to keep us off the rocks . If you ca n't do that , get down with Lewis and pray , but try to help us stay level . As ED says this , we are becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an intensification of the sound we 've been hearing all along . This continues , as they go forward . They come around another turn , and we see that the river before them is speeding up , but is not particularly dangerous-looking . And yet we keep hearing the sound going up and up , becoming something close to a roar . &nbsp; ED ( afraid to believe what he 's hearing ) Bobby , I think I hear some rapids . I know I do . We 're going to have to run them . The canoe begins to move faster , then faster and faster . What is out of sight around the next turn is making the sound . We watch the canoe pick up speed , and the motions of the canoeists ' paddles become more rapid and frequent . &nbsp; ED ( to himself , and to whatever agency might help them ) God . God , do something for us.  --  121  --  They go into the turn , and the water is getting vicious . We see ED and BOBBY working with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEWIS in bottom of canoe , his head back , his eyes closed . The sound is now tremendous ; it is painful to the audience . Spray is flying around the canoe . We see them coming off the turn . Shot of what BOBBY sees from the bow . It is unbelievable in its fury and power . There are rapids as far as the eye can see , seething , raging , tumultous with the very power of the universe itself . Shot of BOBBY as he simply flings his half-paddle away and gets ready to die , his hands over his face . &nbsp; ED ( to BOBBY ) Get down ! Get down ! We see from ED 's position BOBBY drop back off his seat , holding onto the gunwales with both hands , riding right into the teeth of the white water . The camera starts to buck with the canoe . I want this sequence to be the most physically violent participatory experience that any member of any audience -- past or future -- has ever had or ever will have . I will leave it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means . The effect would go on for a long time , with the incredible violence of the river paramount . Against this we show ED doing his best not to die , not to have the canoe capsize , and barely doing it . This should go on for as long as the audience can stand it , or perhaps just a fraction longer than the audience can stand it . Shot of spray clearing away . The sound diminishes for an instant , and in this instant we hear a loud , quick scream , and are given to understand -- again , by whatever means -- that it is LEWIS . We see a quick shot of LEWIS with his open mouth , and then Cut immediately to ED , who is screaming in unison with LEWIS as they ride over the rocks . Shot of ED , and there is a profound exultation on his face . &nbsp; ED ( loudly , and with conviction in which there is that wonderful and dreadful enjoyment that one feels  --  122  --  a few times in a lifetime ) Hold on , boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot from the bow . It is evident that this whole set of rapids culminates in a falloff of about six feet . In other words , if they can get through this , they 're out of danger , at least from this particular set of rapids . We ride up to the falloff , looking at them with horrified fascination -- since there is nothing we can do about it -- from BOBBY 's seat . We go up , the camera loses its angle momentarily , and then focuses down on the riverbed again , as the nose of the canoe falls toward it . Shot of the canoe as it goes over and comes down with terrific impact . It almost capsizes , but does n't . And there it is . Shot of the canoe in the calm water past the falls . It is sloshing with water , and LEWIS is practically submerged . We see , from ED 's position , BOBBY , still fallen back from his seat , try to turn and say something , but he does n't . Nobody says anything . Shot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More shots of riding and paddling . There are no more rapids . Canoeing is just work again , and ED is doing it . There can be as much or as little of this as desired , but I think there should be more , maybe , than the audience thinks there 's going to be . Finally ED , getting things together in his head , speaks . &nbsp; ED ( loudly ) Right back there is where it all happened . BOBBY turns around -- as much as he can -- and stares as though a savage or a madman had spoken . He has no notion of what ED means . &nbsp; EDLook . Somebody is going to ask us things . Maybe we 'll be asked questions together , and maybe they 'll separate us and ask us . But I think we 'd better get our story straight . When you get asked , tell ' em that right back there is where Drew fell out and Lewis broke his leg . That 's where we lost the other canoe . OK ?  --  123  --  &nbsp; BOBBY ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pinpoint this place . Let 's pick out some things we can agree were here . All this is so they do n't go looking for Drew farther upstream . So look . Look , goddamn it ! The camera swings to try to find something to identify the place , just as ED and BOBBY are doing . It comes to rest on a big tree on the left bank . &nbsp; ED ( offscreen ) See that big yellow tree ? That 's going to be the main thing . That , and the rapids , and that big rock we went over . All we have to do is put ' em together , and we 're home free . They 'll go through the motions of looking for Drew , they wo n't find anything , and that 'll be it . We are still looking at the tree as though from the canoe . It is a lightning-struck oak , and very distinctive without being " artily " so . The men are now slumped down again but BOBBY is asleep once more and ED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ; somebody has to be . &nbsp; EDListen , Bobby . Listen good . We 've got to make this right . Drew was drowned back there . I 'd say --  I 'm going to say -- that the best place to look for his body is about where we are now . ( He points down , into the river ) There 's no way for him to get down here from where he really is . There are no roads back in to the river where he is , and nobody 'll go up there looking for him if we do n't give them a reason to . Cut to BOBBY , who is making an eyeshade of one hand and peering at the bank . He looks as though he were seeing , through the most extreme fatigue , a revelation . &nbsp; BOBBY ( pointing vaguely down underneath the canoe ) He 's here , down under us . Right here . OK . I can say that . I can say it . Shot of ED , satisfied . &nbsp; EDGood . Good man . A short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ED ( with an almost academic effort at explanation ) We spilled at that bad place we just came through . We can even tell them we spilled going over that last  --  124  --  big rock . We spilled , and Drew was lost . Since our watches have stopped , we wo n't be able to say exactly when it was . But we can say where . Where is at that yellow tree . &nbsp; ED ( trying to be convincing to himself as much as to BOBBY ) There 's not anything unbelievable about the story , if we can just remember it . There 's nobody --  nobody -- but us left . Nobody saw , nobody knows . If we do n't mess up on the details , we 're all right . &nbsp; BOBBYI sure hope so . &nbsp; EDSo do I. But as Lewis would say , we 've got to do more than hope . Control , baby . It can be controlled . Now give the story back to me , and concentrate . Fix it in your mind . &nbsp; BOBBY ( slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday , and we managed to get down to this part of the river today . But when we came to that bad place ... &nbsp; EDWhere the yellow tree is . &nbsp; BOBBY ... where the yellow tree is , both canoes turned over , and we lost the other one . &nbsp; EDWe lost DREW ... &nbsp; BOBBY ... we lost Drew , and Lewis broke his leg . &nbsp; EDWe looked for Drew . &nbsp; BOBBYFor how long ? &nbsp; EDGood man ! That 's the kind of question we want to be asking ourselves , before somebody else asks us . I 'd say about an hour , as near as we could tell . &nbsp; BOBBYAll right . About an hour . &nbsp; EDWe did n't want to wait any longer because of Lewis . He was in a lot of pain , and we wanted to get help for him . Right ? &nbsp; BOBBY ( slowly ) It fits . &nbsp; EDYou better believe it fits . I think it 's gon na be fine . But stay with me on the story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot now , and we get the impression that the canoe is moving through country that is not nearly  --  125  --  as wild as before . It is not so heavily wooded , and has a nice roll to it . Shot of ED with his head down , the paddle only drifting through the water . He 's an awful mess : ragged , bloody , and dirty . He lifts his head . Unfocused shot of left-hand riverbank . We can see that something -- some animal , maybe : something that moves a little -- is standing there , but it will not come into focus . Then slowly it does . It is a cow : a plain ordinary cow . We zoom in on it as it stands at the river 's edge , and we show it -- if we can -- as ED sees it : as though it were a cow in a nativity scene : as though it were salvation itself : deliverance indeed . &nbsp; ED ( scarcely able to believe himself ) It 's a farm , Bobby . We 're here . We made it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with the marvelous ritualism of men who have been through hell together , smiles as he has n't done before , and holds up the Churchill V-for-Victory sign . We like him a lot now . He , too , is a new man . &nbsp; EDWe did it . &nbsp; BOBBYYou mean you did it . &nbsp; ED ( proudly , but with conviction ) No. ( pause ) We did it . Long shot of canoe sliding along through farms . These are domesticated lands , ageless and pastoral and pleasant . They come off the last turn , and we see from BOBBY 's position a plank bridge over the river set in a steel frame , and below it a gentle spillway . Just under the spillway a man and a boy are fishing with cane poles . At the left is a field of kudzu . We see ED point to the left bank , and BOBBY , wanting to help in any way he can , digs into the river on the right with his hand , to get them there . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out . ED stands beside the canoe looking down at LEWIS in his bed of water and filth . We get a good look at him , and it is obvious that he is in a bad way . His  --  126  --  face is terrifically sunburned ; flakes of dry skin come off his lips when he speaks . &nbsp; EDLewis . Do you hear me , buddy ? &nbsp; LEWIS ( very calmly and clearly ) I hear you , and I 've been hearing you . You 've got it figured . We can get out of this . They wo n't ask me anything , and if they do I 've got the word , same as you gave Bobby . You 're doing it exactly right ; you 're doing it better than I could do . Hang in there . &nbsp; EDI 'm going to get somebody . Can you hold out a little longer ? &nbsp; LEWISSure . My God , those falls must have been something . &nbsp; ED ( quietly ) They were something . We could'a done a lot better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . &nbsp; EDOK . Lie still . We 're home free . Lie still and do n't worry . pp. 85-110 &nbsp; pp. 127-151 WE SEE ED MAKE HIS PAINFUL WAY UP THROUGH THE FIELD We see ED make his painful way up through the field of kudzu to the highway , and then climb onto the highway , which is a blacktop state road . He crosses the bridge over the river . About halfway across , he leans on the bridge rail and stands looking down on the river . We ca n't guess what he 's thinking . Now ED goes on . The highway is shimmering with heat , but far down along it there is something that looks as though it might be a gas station . He goes toward that , holding his side in , stumbling and staggering a little , but we know he will make it . He has n't come so far as he has just to fall down beside a highway , with help in view . Still , it is hard . A couple of cars pass him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled up , and we see the head of a child swing to watch the curious man on the highway . Then ED is alone again . He is nearer the station . Shots of him trying to make the walking easier for himself , but there is n't any way . It is all terribly painful . Now we see that he is almost there . It is a country Shell station . We approach , with ED . A shiftless-looking country boy is sitting in a kitchen chair  --  127  --  outside the station , propped up against the wall . He watches ED come to him as though he could n't believe what he saw . We see ED momentarily from the viewpoint of the boy , and we are incredulous , too . ED is the epitome of the nearly-finished man , and he surely looks it . &nbsp; ED ( stopping in front of the boy ) Is there a phone here ? The boy looks up , confused . &nbsp; EDA phone ? A telephone ? Slowly the boy nods , and gets up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know the numbers . Call the highway patrol and tell them to get right out here . And call an ambulance . People are hurting , and one 's dead . ED sits in chair among the pocket combs for sale and cheap dark glasses . The boy comes into the frame and says rather indifferently , that &nbsp; BOYSomebody 'll be out chere t'reckly . ED closes his eyes , and closes out the world . He leans his head back , and we know that he 's asleep almost immediately . His mouth slowly opens , but he is past caring . The boy sits watching him silently , not moving . Close-up of ED 's face and shoulders as he sleeps . Suddenly he starts and cries out . We shift the view to show that a hand is touching him gently on the shoulder . It comes from a white sleeve . Shot of ED in chair with Negro ambulance driver bending over him . &nbsp; ED ( mumbling ) Have you got a doctor with you ? &nbsp; DRIVER ( and in his voice is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needs anything else in the world ) We got one . He young and good . ( pause ) What in the world happened to you , man ? What in this world ? Somebody shoot you ? &nbsp; ED ( mumbling ) The river happened to me . But I 'm not the one . I 'm just the only one who can move . We 've got a man back down across the bridge who 's bad hurt .  --  128  --  &nbsp; DRIVERYou want to come show us where your man is at ? DRIVER tries to help ED up , and ED rises slowly to his feet . &nbsp; DRIVERHold on to me , man . ED does , but he begins to pass out , and looks as though he might fall . &nbsp; DRIVERYou ca n't make it . You sit right back down . &nbsp; ED ( doggedly ) I can make it . Slowly they walk together out of the station . Shot of DOCTOR sitting in little county ambulance with the door open , writing something . When he sees ED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . He looks at ED briefly , sees the shape he 's in , and goes around and opens the rear doors . &nbsp; EDNo , no . It 's not me . Go back across the bridge . There 's a man in a canoe with a bad fracture . Let 's get him looked after first . &nbsp; ED ( to boy standing in door of station ) Tell the Highway Patrol where we are : just across the bridge , down at the river . Shots of ED getting onto the stretcher in the ambulance . Shots of ambulance driving down highway and across bridge . It stops , and , painful as it is for him , ED gets out with the DOCTOR and DRIVER and goes back down to the canoe . Shots of DOCTOR and DRIVER getting LEWIS out of canoe . ED and BOBBY exchange looks as this is done . All of them go back up to the ambulance through the kudzu field . Shot of them getting LEWIS into the ambulance . Just after he gets in , a Highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The two officers get out , one of them a mean-looking blond boy . &nbsp; BLOND OFFICERWhat 's going on here ? &nbsp; EDWe 've had a bad accident . One of our party drowned in the river about ten miles from here . &nbsp; OFFICER ( suspiciously ) Drownded ?  --  129  --  &nbsp; ED ( with the appearance of complete truth ) Yes . &nbsp; OFFICERHow do you know he drownded ? &nbsp; EDWell , we capsized in the rapids , and it was just every man for himself . I do n't know what happened to him . He may have hit his head on a rock . But I do n't know . We just could n't find him , and I do n't see how he could not be drowned . I hope he 's not , but I 'm afraid he is , he has to be . &nbsp; OFFICER ( musingly ) Well , we 'll have to drag the river . Can you show us ' bout where it was ? &nbsp; EDI think so . We 've got a hurt man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hospital . That 's the first thing . &nbsp; OFFICER ( reluctantly ) OK . We 'll check in on you at the hospital later . &nbsp; ED ( crawling into the ambulance beside LEWIS ) Fine . Shots of ambulance going along the country highway . Shot of ED 's face and LEWIS 's side by side , both with their eyes closed . Finally they stop . We see the doors open , and the DOCTOR 's arms and upper body . &nbsp; DOCTORThis is it , buddy . Take it easy . We 'll get your friend out . Just go along with Cornelius . Shots of ED and DRIVER painfully going toward the little rural hospital . ED depends on DRIVER utterly . Shots of ED and DRIVER going into hospital . Shot of them in corridor . &nbsp; DRIVERSecond door to the right . Shot of ED and DRIVER depositing ED on table of emergency room . DRIVER leaves , and ED slumps down on table . DOCTOR comes in , and we have a sequence depicting his working on ED 's wound . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : very friendly and professional . &nbsp; DOCTORLet 's see now , buddy . Can you raise up just a little bit ? Does this zipper still work ?  --  130  --  &nbsp; ED ( unzipping his flying suit to the waist ) I think so . Helped by the DOCTOR , ED slithers out of the flying suit and is naked except for his filthy tennis shoes and his improvised bandage . Using something from a bottle , the DOCTOR gets off ED 's bandage . &nbsp; DOCTORGood Lord , fellow ! What 's been chopping on you ? Looks like somebody hit you in the side with an ax ! How 'd you do this ? &nbsp; ED ( resignedly ) With an arrow . &nbsp; DOCTORHow in hell did you manage to shoot yourself with an arrow ? I did n't think it could be done . &nbsp; EDI had some hunting arrows in the canoe with me , and when we turned over I think I must have tangled with a rock and shoved one of them through me . But I do n't know , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; DOCTOR ( professionally ) Well , it made a good clean cut that got ragged . You 've got some kind of foreign matter in here , that I 'm going to have to get out .  --  131  --  &nbsp; EDThere was some camouflage paint on the arrow . That 's what it is . But there might be something else in there , too . God knows what 's in there . &nbsp; DOCTORWe 'll get it out . Then we 'll sew you up like a quilt . At about this point we are looking toward the door of the emergency room , and we see LEWIS wheeled by on a stretcher . His stretcher pauses a moment at the door , and then rolls noiselessly out of sight . DOCTOR continues to work on ED 's side . ED lies back on the table with his forearm over his face . &nbsp; DOCTORYou want to stay out here with us tonight ? We 've got plenty of room . &nbsp; EDNo . I 'd like to be with people . And I have to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; EDNo , I really do n't want to stay in a hospital . I can tell you , I do n't . &nbsp; DOCTORYou 've lost some blood . You 'll be pretty weak . &nbsp; EDI 've been weak for days . Do whatever you need to do , and let me get going . I tell you , I need to see people . &nbsp; DOCTORThere 'll be plenty of ' em at Biddiford 's . It 's Sunday night . I sent your other friend there . &nbsp; EDOK . Drive me over there , and take care of Lewis . &nbsp; DOCTORThe other doctor 's working on him . That 's a hell of a break . He 'll be lucky if there 's not some gangrene building up around that place . &nbsp; EDWe 're lucky we 've got you . &nbsp; DOCTOR ( looking up and grinning , and holding up one hand ) You 're fucking aye . Hands of an angel . Cut to Scene in DOCTOR 's car , as he lets ED out at Biddiford 's , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . &nbsp; DOCTORGet through to your wife all right ?  --  132  --  &nbsp; EDYeah . Thanks for the use of the phone . &nbsp; DOCTORTake it easy . And I mean that . &nbsp; EDI will , and I 'll be out tomorrow to see Lewis . ED gets out and in his fantastically ragged and dirty and bloody clothes approaches the house . He goes up onto the sagging country porch and in through the screen door . Cut to Section Details SCENE OF TABLE WHERE EVERYBODY IS EATING AND PASSING FOOD AROUND Scene of table where everybody is eating and passing food around . People look up at him , but most of them make an effort not to embarrass him . We see BOBBY eating with the others , bearded and very hungry . A big jovial farmer gets ED a chair , and he sits down gingerly . Food begins to come at him from all sides . Shyly he takes a little of this and a little of that , and then he is eating madly , trying to thank the various people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , in one of the best moments of his life . We have a brief glimpse of BOBBY across the table from him . BOBBY winks without stopping eating . We see ED eating once more , being passed more things , taking second helpings , all in this deep buzz of conviviality and hospitality , and then we slowly fade the scene out . It is now morning , and ED is lying in brilliant sunlight , on a big country bed . He has part of a sheet over him , and as he gets up we can see his clean new bandage . He winces , and goes over to the chair where he 's hung his coveralls . With obvious distaste he puts them on , then goes out the door . Just before he goes out he looks at himself in the mirror . &nbsp; ED ( to himself , grinning incredulously ) Good Lord ! Cut to Scene in BOBBY 's room . BOBBY is sitting on the bed , dressed , and ED is in an old-fashioned rocking chair . &nbsp; EDFirst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got enough money for that , I think . Blue jeans are all right . And work shirts , maybe . And some shoes . Brogans . BOBBY nods , and takes the crumpled money ED hands him .  --  133  --  &nbsp; BOBBY ( lowering his voice ) Did that one guy ask you about the canoes ? &nbsp; ED ( quickening ) No . What guy ? What about the canoes ? &nbsp; BOBBYThe little old guy who 's some kind of local law man . He asked me about the other canoe : where was it , what was in it , when did we lose it . &nbsp; EDWhat did you tell him ? &nbsp; BOBBYWhat we agreed to tell him : that we lost it in that last bad place . &nbsp; EDDid he say anything else ? &nbsp; BOBBYNo . I do n't have any idea of what he was getting at . &nbsp; EDI do . At least I think I do , and it could be trouble . I do n't know how much trouble , but trouble . &nbsp; BOBBYWhy ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We lost the green canoe day before yesterday , and part of it might have been found before we got to the place where we said we lost it . &nbsp; BOBBY ( hitting his forehead with the flat of his hand ) Je-sus ! &nbsp; EDWe 'll have to patch it up , then . Right now . It 's damned sure that this little guy is gon na get the word around to the state police that something does n't jibe in our story , and then they 'll all be asking us questions . And they 'll separate us , too , and try to get us to contradict each other . So we 've got to sit here right now and become contradict-proof . &nbsp; BOBBYCan we do it ? &nbsp; EDI think so . We have to try . ( with desperate reason ) Let 's go back . We lost the other canoe when Drew was really killed . Right ? &nbsp; BOBBYSure , but if we take them back there ... &nbsp; EDNow wait a minute . ( very deliberately ) Suppose we say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's where we lost the canoe -- exactly where we did lose it , and when we did lose it . ( warming to his new story ) And we can also say that that 's where Lewis broke his leg , which also happens to be true . That 'll  --  134  --  take care of the medical examiners , if they should want to make an investigation or a statement about when Lewis was hurt . We all survived , and we stayed up there all night , trying to help Lewis , and because we could n't run out of the gorge in the dark . OK so far ? &nbsp; BOBBYYes . I think so . &nbsp; ED ( winding it up ) The next day , we all tried to make it downriver in Lewis 's canoe . We were overloaded and taking chances trying to get Lewis out , and we just could n't control the boat when we hit that last stretch of bad rapids . That last half mile of falls got us , and Drew did n't make it . ( pause ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do we 'll be home tomorrow night , or the next night after that , for sure . &nbsp; BOBBY ( urgently ) Suppose they do n't believe us ? What am I gon na say to that little rat-faced bastard when he faces me up to telling him where I said we lost the canoe ? &nbsp; EDTell him -- and anybody else around -- that he misread you : that you never said it . I 'll back you up . ( pause ) There 's one more thing . We did n't see anybody on the river . Not since we left Oree have we seen another human being . &nbsp; BOBBY ( dubiously ) We have n't seen anybody . I wish we had n't . &nbsp; EDWe did n't . And nobody 's gon na go back up into that gorge if we do n't give them a reason to . It 'd be almost impossible to get up in there except by coming down the river , and you know what that 's like . And it would be impossible to do much searching , even if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , then . &nbsp; ED ( not quite through ) The only other thing is whether somebody was reported missing in that area , and people knew more or less where the person was going . But those were awful-looking men ; who 'd care where they were ? &nbsp; BOBBYSomebody might . &nbsp; EDThat 's right . Somebody might . But that one is just beyond us . That 's where we 've got to ride on luck . And I feel lucky . The odds is good !  --  135  --  &nbsp; BOBBY ( having had a sudden thought ) Do you reckon somebody could be listening ? &nbsp; ED ( putting a finger to his lips ) No , but ... ED eases over to the door , stands with his ear to it , then jerks the door quickly open . Nothing is there . He turns to BOBBY and holds up a circle of fingers . &nbsp; EDI 'll be in my room . Go get us those clothes , and then we 'll go out and see Lewis . We 'd better try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if we can find a way to . Cut to Shot of ED and BOBBY pulling up at hospital . They are in DREW 's car . They get out and go in . LEWIS is in a ward , with his leg pulled up on pulleys . Two highway patrolmen are at the near end of the ward , talking to each other , glancing occasionally at LEWIS , who is farther down . &nbsp; ED ( to one patrolman ) Have you been talking to him ? &nbsp; OFFICERNo . We 've been waiting for him to come around . Down the ward , LEWIS turns his head toward them , and before anyone can say anything , ED is already half the distance toward him . &nbsp; ED ( with the false joviality one uses with sick people ) Hello , Tarzan . How 's the world of the great white doctor ? &nbsp; LEWISWhite . &nbsp; EDWhat 've they been trying to do to you ? &nbsp; LEWISYou tell me ! Seems better , though . Behind ED and LEWIS the PATROLMEN move unobtrusively toward them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how to get the change in story across to LEWIS before they get there . &nbsp; LEWISJust do n't let 's get on that last stretch of water again , buddy . Not today , anyway . We are looking from LEWIS 's position at ED , and over his shoulder we can see one of the PATROLMEN . But on ED 's face is a scarcely-controlled expression of  --  136  --  delight : LEWIS has accidentally said the right thing , and the PATROLMAN has heard it . &nbsp; EDNo indeed . Everything went ! Drew was killed . You remember me telling you ? LEWIS nods . &nbsp; LEWISI was n't much help to you , was I ? ED can scarcely believe his luck is this good : LEWIS has said another right thing : the rightest of all . &nbsp; EDIt 's not your fault you broke your leg . We were all damned lucky to get through that gorge . You just got hit . That 's all . Could have been any of us . Could have been all of us . ED straightens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ward . &nbsp; PATROLMANY'all want to wait , on down here a ways ? ED goes back down the ward to where BOBBY is standing . We can see the PATROLMAN saying a few words to LEWIS , and then he comes back to ED and BOBBY .  --  137  --  &nbsp; PATROLMANYou want to take us on out , now , to where it happened ? &nbsp; EDI 'll do my best . Section Details CUT NOW TO Cut now to Shot of patrol car with PATROLMAN and ED in it , making its way slowly along the riverbank through the woods . Behind it are a miscellany of trucks , battered cars , pickup trucks , jeeps , and so on . We show them progressing , in this strange caravan , for a while . Then we hear the heightened sound of the river , and through the windshield of the patrol car , through the other trees , begins to loom the lightning-struck yellow tree that ED has marked the place with . &nbsp; PATROLMAN ( to ED ) He 'd be right in here ? &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or he may be caught in the rocks . But we probably ought to start here . Shots of patrol car stopping , of the other vehicles stopping behind it in a long , queer line along the bank , and of men getting out . Shot of ED and PATROLMAN standing beside the car . ED is looking at the patrol car from which BOBBY and another PATROLMAN emerge . BOBBY is quickly surrounded by policemen and others , and we have the momentary impression that BOBBY is a prisoner . A PATROLMAN is talking to him with a slight vehemence , or appears to be . It does not look good to ED , though it may in reality be nothing at all an illusion . Cut to Shot of ED and PATROLMAN sitting on bank , not saying anything to each other , watching the searchers deploy with their hooks and grapples . ED is drinking a Coke . Men are standing along the bank policemen and others . From one of these groups a small , old , light-bodied man detaches himself and comes over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buddy . Can I talk to you for a minute ? &nbsp; EDSure . Sit down . &nbsp; QUEENYou sure this is the place ?  --  138  --  &nbsp; ED ( looking at him with a certain surprise ) Not all that sure . But I ca n't do any better . He 's either in those rocks up there , or here , or downstream . How far downstream I do n't know . &nbsp; QUEENYou say you'uz coming down this-yere river in a canoe ? &nbsp; EDTwo canoes , we started with . &nbsp; QUEENHow come ? &nbsp; EDHow come what ? &nbsp; QUEENHow come you to be doin ' this , in the fust place ? &nbsp; ED ( hesitating a little , not really knowing the answer , even now ) Oh , ... I guess we just wanted to get out a little . All of us work in the city , and it gets pretty tiresome , just sitting in an office all the time . The fellow who broke his leg 's been up here before , fishing . He said we ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all . No good reason . Just boredom , I suppose . &nbsp; QUEEN ( after a moment ) I kin understand that . You did n't know what you'uz agettin ' into , did you ? ED No , indeed , we did n't . We sure did n't know it 'd be anything like this . &nbsp; QUEENYou say you started out day before yesterday ? ED We started Friday , at about four o'clock in the afternoon . &nbsp; QUEENIn two canoes . &nbsp; EDRight . &nbsp; QUEENAnd you lost one of ' em right here ? &nbsp; EDNo , a long ways upstream . When we came through here , we were all in one canoe . They sit watching the searchers , and we see what they see the men , some of them waist-deep in the river , working with their grapples . One of the men in the river speaks or calls to another . &nbsp; QUEEN ( deliberately and slowly , still looking at the river ) Your buddy says different .  --  139  --  &nbsp; ED ( with both real and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Go ask him . &nbsp; QUEEN ( shaking his head ) I done already asked him . ED Ask him again , or the one in the hospital . &nbsp; QUEENNo ; no . You done had a chance to talk to ' em . &nbsp; ED ( with real indignation ) What the hell are you driving at ? ( he turns to PATROLMAN ) Look , do I have to put up with this ? I 'll be goddamned if I will . Is he authorized to do this ? &nbsp; PATROLMAN ( conciliatingly Maybe you better answer a few more questions . Then he can handle it however he wants to . &nbsp; QUEEN ( playing his trump card ) We found half that other canoe before you say you even got down in this part of the river . &nbsp; ED ( since he 's ready for this ) So what ? I told you we lost the other one farther up . Back up in a gorge . If you want to try to go up there , I can take you and show you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back up in there . &nbsp; EDThat 's your problem . Look , what in God 's name is this all about , anyway ? ( pause ) Are you the sheriff here ? &nbsp; QUEENDepitty . &nbsp; EDWhere 's the sheriff ? &nbsp; QUEEN ( gesturing toward a group of men ) He 's right over yonder . &nbsp; EDWell , go get him . I want to talk to him . &nbsp; EDsits for a while drinking his Coke . When QUEEN and SHERIFF BULLARD come over , he gets up . &nbsp; SHERIFFMy name 's Bullard . You want to see me ? &nbsp; EDYes . Can you tell me what this man of yours is getting at ? I think he 's trying to call me a liar . He seems to think we threw one of our party in the river , or something . &nbsp; QUEENMaybe you did .  --  140  --  &nbsp; EDFor Christ 's sake , for what reason ? &nbsp; QUEEN ( sullenly , like he says everything ) How would I know that ? I know you ca n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for you to be lyin ' . &nbsp; SHERIFFEasy , Mr. QUEEN . ( to ED ) What about this ? &nbsp; EDWhat do you mean , what about it ? This man 's just confused . Maybe he does n't like city people . God knows what his game is . What 's the matter , Mr. QUEEN ? People around here feel like you 're not earning your money ? &nbsp; QUEEN ( turning completely murderous ) I 'll tell you what 's the matter , you city son of a bitch . My sister called me yesterday and told me her husband had been out huntin ' and had n't come back . I 'll just goddamned well guarantee y'all met up with him somewhere . And I 'm on prove it . &nbsp; ED ( unconcernedly ) Fine . Prove it . &nbsp; SHERIFFWhat 's wrong with you , Mr. QUEEN ? Why jump on these fellows about something in your family ? ED Listen , Sheriff . I 've had it with this river , with the woods , with the whole fucking business up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of  --  and you 'd better have some evidence  --  I 'd appreciate your getting him off my back . &nbsp; SHERIFFtakes out a piece of paper and hands it to ED . &nbsp; SHERIFFHere . We can use this for a statement . Look it over . &nbsp; EDperuses paper for a moment , concentrating . &nbsp; EDIt 's all right . But I do n't know the names of these places . Is this ( he indicates falls of river ) Griffin 's Shoot ? Shot of the last of the murderous rapids . &nbsp; SHERIFF ( voice over ) That 's what it is . Griffin 's Shoot . Shot of ED signing paper . He hands it back to SHERIFF . &nbsp; SHERIFFYou 're sure , now . &nbsp; EDYou better believe I 'm sure .  --  141  --  &nbsp; QUEEN ( pulling at SHERIFF 'S arm ) He ai n't sure . He 's lyin ' . He 's lyin ' the his teeth . He 's done somethin ' up yonder . He 's done kilt my brother-in-law . &nbsp; ED ( turning with equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe your brother-in-law killed somebody . Why are you bringing in all this talk about killing ? Is that the only thing you people up here understand ? The river did all the killing we saw . If you do n't think it 'll kill you get your stupid ass on it and see for yourself . &nbsp; SHERIFF ( conciliatingly ) Now , Mr. Gentry . Do n't talk like that . Ai n't no call for it . &nbsp; ED ( cooling off a little ) Well , this 'll do till there is . &nbsp; SHERIFF ( looking out over the river and the searchers , all of which are darkening ) Looks like that 's goin ' to haf to wind it up tonight . Gettin ' too dark , ( turns to ED ) You boys be stayin ' in Aintry tonight ? &nbsp; EDYes . We 're at Biddiford 's . But you know that . &nbsp; SHERIFFYeah , I know it . We 'll be coming back out chere tomorrow morning . You can come if you want to , but you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to town tomorrow . &nbsp; EDBelieve me , I 'd come back out with you if I thought it 'd do any good . But if the body 's not right in here I do n't know where it is . Maybe downstream farther , ( pauses ) I guess we 'll go on back home . We 've been gone too long anyway . &nbsp; QUEENHe 's lyin ' , Sheriff . Do n't let him go . Do n't let the son of a bitch go . &nbsp; SHERIFF ( reasonably ) We got nothin ' to hold him for , Arthel . Nothin ' . These boys 've been through a lot . They want to get back home . &nbsp; QUEEN ( almost screaming ) Do n't let him go . I can just look at him and tell . ( pauses , panting ) Listen , my sister called up last night , and she was just a-cryin ' . Benson ai n't come home yet . She knows he 's dead . She just knows it . He ai n't never been gone this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in there , when he was . &nbsp; SHERIFFNow , you do n't know that , Arthel . What you mean is , they was the only city fellows .  --  142  --  Among them , ED shakes his head , in both real and feigned unbelief at such goings-on . &nbsp; SHERIFFY'all can go any time you want to . Just leave me your addresses . &nbsp; EDWe 'll start out early , you can bet . ( pauses ) Let us know if you find anything . &nbsp; SHERIFFDo n't worry . You 'll be the fust . Brief shot of searchers coming out of river with their grapples and hooks , empty-handed . Dissolve scene , diminuendo sound of river . Fade in on ward of hospital where LEWIS lies , his leg raised in pulleys . He is reading the paper . ED and BOBBY come into frame , and he looks up , grinning . There is another man in the ward , in the next bed to LEWIS . It is morning . ED and BOBBY are clean shaven . &nbsp; EDWe 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , and Carolyn or I or somebody can come back and get you when you 're ready to travel . I 'll call Carolyn when I get home . &nbsp; LEWIS ( quite satisfied with these arrangements ) Great . I ought to be out of here in a week or two . Or three . &nbsp; EDSure . Lie back and enjoy yourself . This is not such a bad town . We 've even made a couple of friends here . Shot of ED and BOBBY , in DREW 's car , pulling into the filling station where LEWIS 's car is sitting , with the empty canoe rack on top . Beside this sits SHERIFF BULLARD in his car , evidently waiting for them . &nbsp; SHERIFFMornin ' . Y'all gettin ' an early start , eh ? &nbsp; EDThought we would . What can we do for you ? &nbsp; SHERIFFNot a thing . Just wanted to make sure you had your keys , and everything you need . ED gets out and stands beside SHERIFF 'S car . &nbsp; EDWe can make it fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one thing , though . We owe some fellows up in Oree for bringing these cars down . Would you tell them that we 'll send them the money , just as quick as we get back ? They 'll believe you before they will us.  --  143  --  &nbsp; SHERIFFBe glad to . What 're their names ? &nbsp; EDGriner . They run a garage up there . There was also another man with them . I do n't know who he was . &nbsp; SHERIFF ( with an expression that could mean everything or nothing ) Maybe we ought to know who he was . I might even go up there and talk to all of ' em myself . And you kin be sure I 'll tell ' em about the money . &nbsp; ED ( winding it up ) OK . We 're going along now . &nbsp; SHERIFF ( suddenly ) Buddy , let me tell you one thing . Do n't ever do anything like this again . Do n't come back up here . &nbsp; ED ( slowly , with a half smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( pauses ) You act like you 're telling a hired gun to get out of town . But we 're all bow and arrow men . &nbsp; SHERIFFYou listen to me now , boy . &nbsp; EDI 'm listening . &nbsp; SHERIFFWe do n't want no more of this kind of business . Draggin ' that river 's tough .  --  144  --  &nbsp; EDYou wo n't see us again . &nbsp; SHERIFFOK . So long . Have a good trip . &nbsp; EDSo long . And I hope Deputy QUEEN finds his brother-in-law . &nbsp; SHERIFFAw , he 'll come in drunk . He 's a mean bastard anyway . Old QUEEN ' s sister 'd be better off without him . So would everybody else . &nbsp; EDstarts to get in DREW 's car . &nbsp; SHERIFF'Fore you go , buddy , let me ask you something and tell you something . &nbsp; ED ( over his shoulder ) Ask me . &nbsp; SHERIFFHow come y'all ended up with four life jackets ? &nbsp; ED ( knowing this is an easy one ) We had an extra one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find another one around here somewhere , if it has n't already gone past , downriver. ( pauses ) Now what was it you wanted to tell me ? &nbsp; SHERIFFYou done good . &nbsp; ED ( much relieved and complimented ) Somebody had to do something . I did n't want to die any more than anybody else did . &nbsp; SHERIFFYou'uz hurt bad , but if it wud n't for you , you 'd all be in the river with your other man . ED climbs into car and buckles down , as BOBBY gets into LEWIS 's car . &nbsp; EDThanks , Sheriff . I 'll take that with me . Shot of the two city cars starting up . &nbsp; ED ( to BOBBY , over engine sound ) Let 's go get the canoe . &nbsp; BOBBY ( genuinely horrified ) Jesus , no ! Leave it . I never want to see it or touch it or smell it again . Leave the goddamned thing ! &nbsp; ED ( shaking his head ) No . We 're going to get it . Follow me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Shot of ED and BOBBY coming down through the field of kudzu to where the canoe still is . Some muddy little children are playing in it . ED gets down beside the near side of the canoe , and we have a close shot of him as he runs his hand up and down the metal . We see at close range , now , what a terrific beating the hull has taken . The paint is flaked off , there are huge gouged-out dents in the metal , and the whole effect is that of metal that has been mistreated beyond anything that it can possibly take . The canoe looks as though it had been through a barrage of flak . If there was ever a case of " metal fatigue , " this is it . Shot of ED and BOBBY wrestling the canoe out of the water and dumping out the bilge . ED straightens . Shot of view across the river . There seems to be some kind of activity going on over there , in amongst some trees and bushes , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We watch long enough to know that we are likely looking at a cemetery . ED speaks to little girl . &nbsp; EDWhat is it ? A funeral ? &nbsp; LITTLE GIRL ( in very nasal , country tones ) Naw . They 're gon na move them people ' fore they finish the dam . They 're diggin ' ' em up . Shot of graveyard , and now we can see the stacked coffins , and the men moving among them . &nbsp; ED ( to BOBBY ) Like TVA , I guess . BOBBY I guess . Come on , for God 's sake . Let 's leave this place . Brief shots of ED and BOBBY strapping the canoe onto LEWIS 's car . BOBBY gets in . &nbsp; ED ( waving him to get going ) Go ahead . You know where Lewis lives . And if you tell our story to anybody , tell it right . You know ? &nbsp; BOBBY ( smiling wryly ) I 'll remember it . How could I forget ? &nbsp; EDSee you in town . Shot of BOBBY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back through the kudzu , a very , very solitary figure . The children have gone . He stands looking at the river , upstream and down . Very slowly he crouches ,  --  146  --  and picks up a double handful of water . He rises , and in the manner of a private ceremonial , drinks the water . Fade scene . Shots of DREW 's car with ED in it moving along desolate country roads , past farms , through little towns , past religious posters , and so on , in the exact reverse of the journey that brought ED and the others into the mountains . We have a few shots of ED driving , his face composed , and with a kind of secret knowledge on it , and we also notice a decal on the windshield it is a decal of the soft-drink company that DREW worked for . Oddly enough , there is also a compass mounted on the dashboard . What we want to do in this sequence is to show the state road become a larger highway , and then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into his own territory , his own life , by showing him move from the country and state roads into the big highway bordered with filling stations , drive-ins , motels , and so on . We show some of these fleetingly as he goes by , notably the screen of the drive-in movie that the party passed on the way to the mountains , and perhaps a deserted Home of the Whopper . By these progressive stages we see him reach the point at which he turns off the freeway , enters a suburb , then drives into his own driveway and into the backyard , stops the car and gets out , a kind of stranger who belongs here . We see the back door of ED 's house as MARTHA opens it . She comes out into the yard and looks at ED carefully , not knowing quite what to say . ED takes his knife and belt out of the car , and slings them deep into the suburban woods behind the house . Then slowly , very carefully , he takes MARTHA in his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They go into the house together . Shot in living room as ED stands looking out the picture window onto the street . &nbsp; EDI could sure use a drink , sugar . ED pulls off his work shirt and looks at the bandage at his side , which is stained with blood . &nbsp; MARTHA ( coming to him ) Tell me . Tell me . What happened to you ? I knew something like this would happen . &nbsp; ED ( with a kind of smile ) No you did n't . Not anything like this .  --  147  --  &nbsp; MARTHA ( and in her voice is the kind of practical love that makes marriages ) Come lie down , baby . Let me have a look . Shot of MARTHA in bathroom , where she opens the door to the medicine cabinet and takes out a couple of bottles . There should be something at least somewhat amusing in the medicine cabinet itself , which looks like a small hospital packed into the wall . MARTHA puts an old sheet on the bed , and ED lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick , loving rips . &nbsp; EDI think you just like this playing nurse . &nbsp; MARTHAAll ex-nurses play nurse . For the rest of their lives . Especially when they love somebody . ( pause ) You 're all right . It 's a good job . The edges are pulling together . &nbsp; EDCan I get up now , Nurse ? &nbsp; MARTHANo ; I 've got to rebandage . &nbsp; EDIs this what you call romance ? &nbsp; MARTHANo . I never called it romance . I call it love , actually . It includes enemas and cleaning up your man 's vomit . ( pointing to ED 's side ) Us wives and nurses know it includes this . &nbsp; EDWhat about the wine and roses ? &nbsp; MARTHA ( smiling a tough , practical , loving smile ) We get those , too . &nbsp; EDYes . That 's the real right thing , I guess . All of it . ( pause ) Look , let me go see Drew 's wife . Then I 'm coming back and sleep for a week . Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me over and drive me back ? &nbsp; MARTHASure . Cut to Shot of the two cars pulling up in front of DREW 's house . ED gets out and goes to the door . He rings . The door is opened by DREW 's little boy , about nine years old , in a Cub Scout uniform .  --  148  --  Shot as ED enters and little boy runs to get Mrs. Ballinger . ED stands looking . He has the keys to DREW 's car in his hand , jingling indecisively . The room is full of sound equipment : record players and tape recorders , and there is one record out : a blues player , maybe Scrapper Blackwell or Pink Anderson or the Reverend Gary Davis . Mrs. Ballinger comes in . ED holds out the keys as if in supplication . &nbsp; EDMrs . Ballinger , Drew has been killed . Shot of MRS . BALLINGER slowly raising both hands to her mouth and beginning to shake her head desperately in unbelief . &nbsp; ED ( going on ) He was drowned . Lewis broke his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have all been killed . Shot of MRS . BALLINGER , shaking her head violently , her mouth full of fingers . &nbsp; MRS . BALLINGERSo useless . &nbsp; EDYes it was useless . We should n't have gone . But we did . We did . &nbsp; MRS . BALLINGERSuch a goddamned useless way to die . &nbsp; EDI guess every way is useless . &nbsp; MRS . BALLINGERNot this useless . &nbsp; ED ( entreatingly ) We stayed as long as they needed us up there , looking for the body . They 're still looking . &nbsp; MRS . BALLINGERUseless . &nbsp; EDDrew was the best man we had . I 'm so sorry . I 'm so goddamned sorry . Is there anything I can do ? I mean that . Can I ... &nbsp; MRS . BALLINGER ( in terrible woman fury ) You can get out of here , Mr. Gentry . You can get out of here and go find that insane friend of yours , Lewis Medlock , and you can shoot him . That 's what you can do . &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffice ) He 's hurt bad himself . He 's just as sorry as I am . It 's not anybody 's fault . It 's the river 's fault .  --  149  --  &nbsp; MRS . BALLINGER ( resignedly ) All right , Ed . Nobody can do anything . Nobody can ever do anything . It 's all so useless . Everything is useless . It always has been . &nbsp; ED ( trying one more thing ) Can I have Martha come over and stay with you for a couple of days ? &nbsp; MRS . BALLINGER ( beginning to break , and break badly ) I do n't want Martha . I want Drew . She turns and flees the room , and ED looks at the keys in his hand . He puts them in a conspicuous place on the coffee table , beside the Company History , bound in morocco . We see ED go out , and get into the car with MARTHA . Shot of ED and MARTHA back home . It is dusk , and ED is sitting in an arm chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his legs , crinking whiskey . MARTHA is on the floor at his feet , and so is the bottle of whiskey . &nbsp; MARTHA ( trying one last time ) Baby , tell me what it is . Is somebody after you ? &nbsp; EDI do n't know . I do n't think so . Somebody may be after me . Also , the law may be after me . I 've just got to tough it out . If nothing happens for a couple of weeks , I think we 'll be all right . &nbsp; MARTHA ( looking up frankly into his eyes ) Ca n't you tell me ? &nbsp; ED ( firmly ) No , I ca n't tell you now . Maybe I ca n't ever tell you . &nbsp; MARTHA ( tough as hell : she 's seen a thousand people cut in knife fights ) Who cut you , ED ? Who cut my good man ? &nbsp; ED ( tiredly , barely able to talk ) I fell on one of my own arrows . &nbsp; MARTHAGo to sleep , honey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm right here with you . There 's no more woods and no more river . Go to sleep . We see them sitting there , in the dark now , ED in the chair and MARTHA on the floor with her head in his lap . Then , slowly but inexorably , they begin to be enveloped in light , more and more light , until the chair is like the chair in an interrogation , a third  --  150  --  degree . The light is so vivid that it is almost unbearable , and it has a kind of shifting movement in it . We now see ED 's face in close-up , transfigured by the light , its mouth open in speechless horror . A hand  --  MARTHA 's  --  comes into the frame and closes the mouth , and the light diminishes . Shot of car backing down the hill of ED 's driveway : this has just been a car using the driveway to turn around in . We follow the car away down the suburban street , and fade the scene . Shot of ED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The door is open . He is handing a sheaf of roughs to an aid . He seems vigorous and very much in place . The studio is buzzing around him . Somebody cracks a joke , and somebody else laughs . ED looks at his watch , takes his jacket from the hanger on the wall , and goes out . Shot of ED walking down the street to the corner drug store . We see him buying a paper . He opens it . There is a picture of DREW  --  evidently a college-annual Picture  --  and a caption saying that Drew S. Ballinger has been killed in a canoeing accident . We see ED giving this item a good look . Slightly longer shot of ED as he stands reading the paper in the street . A girl , the model from the Kitt'n Britches ad , walks up to him , all dewy innocence , and stands waiting for him to finish . He barely glances at her , and then resumes his perusal of the newspaper . She regretfully goes on . Fade scene . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's left of his hair is slightly mussed , so we know he is not in or near the office . He pulls something back to his eye . It is the peepsight on the bowstring , just as it was used when he shot the man from the tree . There is the same expression on ED 's face : exactly the same . Shot of field target framed in string . We hear the whing of the bowstring as ED lets go . &nbsp; LEWIS ( offscreen ) Hey ! Pull back to reveal ED and LEWIS beside lake , shooting at a beautiful downhill target about fifty-five yards off . They both have expensive target bows ,  --  151  --  very professional-looking , with torque stabilizers and precision bow sights . We see them hang their bows on a convenient bow rack in a tree , and walk amiably down to the target to pull the arrows . Shot of ED and LEWIS walking along toward target , and it is evident that LEWIS has a limp : not an extremely bad limp , but noticeable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and pays expert attention to the arrows . &nbsp; LEWISPretty good , buddy ! You beat me that time ! Long shot of the two of them walking slowly back to the bows , along the very edge of the lake . There is a tree there . We come in close on the base of it , and there is an old piece of nylon rope tied to the base . Still talking , ED rather negligently pulls the rope loose from the tree and tosses it into a camp-area-type garbage can . &nbsp; LEWISLet 's have a beer . How about it ? ED begins to answer , but before we hear him say anything there is an unexpected , ear-splitting scream , a scream exactly like BOBBY 's in the forest when he was raped : what either is or could be a terrible human cry of pain . ED and LEWIS continue to walk and talk , not paying the slightest attention to the scream . They walk and gesture like old friends , maybe seeming to kid each other a little . We swing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is DEAN , ED 's son , getting ready to leap out from the bank on a pair of water skis . He is shouting good-natured imprecations at the boy his own age running the boat . Finally the boat guns up and we see DEAN leap out onto the water , yipping like a cowboy . We pull up to a helicopter shot which shows the vastness of the lake that now covers the valley of the Cahulawassee , upon which the solitary water-skier is making patterns . His small voice , still with the same note , comes to us , but now it seems to be a cry of joy , of exultation . We go slowly to black , and super over this a small unpretentious END , like the end credit of a home movie , over which the cry still seems to hang , even after it is gone . pp. 111-126 &nbsp;
