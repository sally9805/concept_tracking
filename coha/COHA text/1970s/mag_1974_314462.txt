When a severe water shortage started in Marin County outside San Francisco four years ago , more and more families began to consider moving deeper into the exurbs .

" <P> Federal Judge Lloyd Burke concluded , " No city may regulate its population growth numerically so that residents of other cities can not enter and establish residency there . " He based his decision on the right to travel , apparently the first judge to do so in such a case . Petaluma will probably appeal , making it likely that the Supreme Court will eventually have to sort out the competing interests of two treasured American values : local self-rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
