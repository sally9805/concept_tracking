SEC investigators say they want to talk to Laird about his alleged activities on behalf of Ball , 84 , who is accused of trying to engineer an insiders ' scheme involving the sale of stock in Florida East Coast Railway . Ball is board chairman of Florida East Coast . LAIRD 'S alleged involvement in the Ball case surfaced during a closed hearing last Friday in United States District Court here before Judge William B. Jones . Court papers were made available to the New York News . Efforts to reach Laird for comment on the ease were unsuccessful . SEC lawyers Ralph C. Ferrara and Theodore A. Levine told the court the alleged interference occurred in 1972 , while Laird was defense secretary . Also named were two of Laird 's closest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Army for manpower and reserve affairs , and William J. Baroody Jr. , now on the White House staff as an assistant to Leonard Garment , Presidential special counsel . rl THIRD HIGH Pentagon official , John Dressendorfer , is alleged to have actually made phone calls on Ball 's behalf to the highest levels of the SEC . Dressendorfer reportedly told investigators that he placed the call at Laird 's order . Dressendorfer , now special civilian assistant to Navy Secretary John Warner , said in a telephone interview that he felt he was doing nothing wrong in calling the SEC . He insisted he was merely trying to find out if there was a case pending against Ball . " If that 's undue influence , we 're in pretty bad shape , " he ? aid . Dressendorfer , f or m e r l y Wallace 's aide , noted that ex-Congressman Laird frequently got requests from former constituents to ' ' help them out on such things as why they have n't received their Social Security check . " WHEN IT WAS suggested that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laird 's native Wisconsin , probably was not worried about his Social Security check , Dressendorfer said with a laugh , " No , I understand he 's a pretty tough cookie . " Levine gave the following account to Judge Jones : " I first was told that Mr. Baroody was the one who communicated to the commission . Upon several calls to Mr. Baroody , Mr. Baroody indicated that he had not made the calls , but was aware of them in the back of his mind .. . " When I spoke to Mr. Wallace , he said  --  and this is what they told me over the phone , it was n't under oath  --  he said that Mr. Laird had . . . met with Mr. Ball and Mr. Laird had told him to make the communication or to have it done and that Mr. Wallace had instructed Mr. Dressendorfer , who was working for Mr. Wallace at the time , to make the call . " I THEN CALLED Mr. Dressendorfer and Mr. Dressendorfer said he had made two calls . Judge Jones : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Levine : " Mr. Laird . He was aware of the fact that it emanated from Mr. Laird . " Levine noted that the inquiry on Ball 's behalf appeared spurred by " two reasons . " ? " One was to ask the SEC investigators to stop harrassing Mr. Ball , because he was an old man ; two , to find out the status of the investigation . " WALLACE confirmed that , acting on Laird 's request , he had told Dressendorfer to make the calls on Ball 's behalf late last year while the SEC was preparing its case against the railroad magnate . However , Wallace denied that Laird ' was seeking to use his influence to quash the SEC probe of Ball 's activities . During Friday 's hearing , Levine told Judge Jones that following Dressendorfer 's second call " about the status of the investigation and where it was going , " he was told " It 's none of your business . . . you had had better stay away from it .
