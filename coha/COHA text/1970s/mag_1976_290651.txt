SIMPLE JUSTICE <P> by RICHARD KLUGER <P> 823 pages . Knopf. $15.95 . <P> On May 17 , 1954 , Chief Justice Earl Warren , speaking for a unanimous Supreme Court , found for the plaintiff in the case of Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka . Brown was Linda , a cheerful , slightly plump , eleven-year-old Kansas schoolgirl who happened to be black . Halfway through his opinion , the Chief Justice asked a long , deceptively innocent question : " Does segregation of children in public schools , solely on the basis of race , even though the physical facilities and other ' tangible ' factors may be equal , deprive the children of the mi nority group of equal education opportunities ? " His brief answer : " We believe that it does . " <P> Even Justice Stanley Reed , who came nearest to dissenting , declared afterward that if this was not the most significant judgment in the history of the court , it came very close to it . Louis H. Pollak , later a dean of Yale Law School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governmental act of any kind since the Emancipation Proclamation . " Richard Kluger goes even farther . He puts this revolutionary ruling-deliberately phrased in bland language and read in a matter-of-fact voice by a moderate Republican from California-at the heart of 200 years of American history . <P> A sometime editor ( Simon &; Schuster , Atheneum ) and sometime novelist ( When the Bough Breaks , National Anthem ) , Richard Kluger has the special courage of the amateur : he is not afraid to be obvious . From the start , he argues , the Declaration of Independence was marred by a fundamental hypocrisy . All men were not created equal-if they happened to be black . More than 300 years after the introduction of slavery , nearly 100 years after the Emancipation Proclamation , the Brown decision belatedly acknowledged this cruelly corrupting double standard . It focused on the nation 's most sensitive testing ground of equality-the public schools . By asking for this disingenuously titled " simple justice , " the Warren Court made possible a second chapter to the American Dream-a " resurrection . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kluger 's reading may seem falsely optimistic . Many now feel that too much was expected of the schools when they were in effect made instruments of social change . He himself is the first to point out that ten years after the Brown decision , only 1.17% of black schoolchildren were attending classes with white children in the states that once constituted the Confederacy . Nor does he neglect to mention that after 20 years 259 Chicago schools were 90% ( or more ) black , while 109 were 90% ( or more ) white . Yet obstinately , unfashionably-for surely this is not the civil rights ' 60s-he stands by his thesis . <P> The Brown decision , Kluger assumes , can not be understood unless a reader is familiar with previous litigation . More than 100 cases are cited ; in addition , the reader is given a cram course in constitutional law , with copious quotes from The Federalist . The Supreme Court passes in review , as well as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
