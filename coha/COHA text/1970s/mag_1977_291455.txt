MAJESTY : ELIZABETH II AND <P> THE HOUSE OF WINDSOR <P> by ROBERT LACEY <P> 349 pages . Harcourt Brace Jovanovich . <P> $12.95 . <P> <P> Shortly after Elizabeth II began her reign , John Osborne , king of the Angry Young Men , took time between hit plays to pronounce the British monarchy moribund- " A gold filling in a mouth full of decay . " But how unpredictable history can be , as kings and queens are the first to know . Osborne has long since been dethroned , while Her Majesty - cresting on ' 70s nostalgia and God only knows what other divine rights - has never been more popular . <P> Biographer Robert Lacey 's task is to relate the woman who happens to live in Buckingham Palace to this " flourishing of the British constitutional monarchy " - one of the more " curious social phenomena of the 20th century , " as he rightly observes . It is no easy job , and the word paradox gets used freely . In the end , Lacey , the author of a biography of Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times ) , has spread his cloak over the puddle and gallantly invented a second Elizabeth to walk across it . If this act of prestidigitation is not a work of art , it is a work of considerable artifice . <P> Sensible Shoes . In effect , Lacey has treated Elizabeth as a minor character in a Jane Austen novel . An " unassuming mother of four " who dotes on a " quiet life in the country surrounded by horses and dogs , " she tramps over for tea in her sensible shoes and serves modestly to swell a scene or two , mostly by making other people look brilliant . But how to turn her into a heroine ? <P> Even as a child , " Lillibet , " as royal baby talk dubbed her , proves a hard act for Lacey to humanize . It is as if she were born with her crown on . Her grandfather George V had written to her father George VI : " Now that you are five years old I hope you will always try and be obedient and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it will come much easier to you the sooner you begin . " The advice helped give her father a lifelong case of the stammers . Elizabeth appears to have thrived on it , suffering nothing worse than an occasional sinus attack . By the time she was eight she was joining in on the royal discipline , chiding Sister Margaret Rose , age 4 , for exposing too much leg in public . <P> Ginger Cookies . What can a poor legendmaker do with a late 20th century woman whose avowed model is Queen Victoria ? By way of apology , Lacey theorizes that the sepulchral gloom of blacked-out Windsor Castle during World War II helped turn a " serious child into a serious girl . " Certainly nobody could work harder than Lacey to put a little color in the girl 's cheeks . He makes the most of her first meeting at 13 , over ginger cookies and lemonade , with the brilliantly blue-eyed naval cadet who was to become her husband . Whenever possible the subject is shown to smile . The jolly shrieks of bathtime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the royal couple 's bedroom door at night-at least according to the guards posted there . The Queen , Lacey maintains , is a fun girl at charades . He does not neglect to point out her kicking off her shoes while initialing documents at her desk or , kerchief on head , chopping up meat for her beloved corgis.
