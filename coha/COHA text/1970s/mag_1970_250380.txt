Seldom Seldom do do Utopias Utopias pass pass from from dream dream to to reality , reality , but but it is often an illuminating exercise to predict what could happen if they did . The following very personal and partisan speculations on how the world might be different if Women 's Lib had its way were written for TIME by Gloria Steinem , a contributing editor of New York magazine , whose journalistic curiosity ranges from show business to Democratic politics . Miss Steinem admits to being not only a critical observer but a concerned advocate of the feminist revolt , <P> ANY change is fearful , especially one affecting both politics and sex roles , so let me begin these Utopian speculations with a fact . To break the ice . <P> Women do n't want to exchange places with men . Male chauvinists , science-fiction writers and comedians may favor that idea for its shock value , but psychologists say it is a fantasy based on ruling-class ego and guilt . Men assume that women want to imitate them , which is just what white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may convince the second-class group of the need to imitate , but for both women and blacks that stage has passed . Guilt produces the question : What if they could treat us as we have treated them ? <P> That is not our goal . But we do want to change the economic system to one more based on merit . In Women 's Lib Utopia , there will be free access to good jobs - and decent pay for the bad ones women have been per forming all along , including housework . In creased skilled labor might lead to a four-hour workday , and higher wages would en courage further mechanization of repetitive jobs now kept alive by cheap labor . <P> With women as half the country 's elected representatives , and a woman President once in a while , the country 's machismo problems would be greatly reduced . The old-fashioned idea that manhood depends on violence and victory is , after all , an important part of our troubles in the streets , and in Viet Nam . I 'm not saying that women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than men ; we are only uncorrupted by power so far . When we do acquire power , we might turn out to have an equal impulse toward aggression . <P> Even now , Margaret Mead believes that women fight less of ten but more fiercely than men , because women are not taught the rules of the war game and fight only when cornered . But for the next 50 years or so , women in politics will be very valu able by tempering the idea of manhood into something less ag gressive and better suited to this crowded , post-atomic planet . <P> Consumer protection and children 's rights , for instance , might get more legislative attention . <P> Men will have to give up ruling-class privileges , but in re turn they will no longer be the only ones to support the fam ily , get drafted , bear the strain of power and responsibility . <P> Freud to the contrary , anatomy is not destiny , at least not for more than nine months at a time . In Israel , women are drafted , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men type and run switchboards . In India and Israel , a woman rules . In Sweden , both parents take care of the children . In this country , come Utopia , men and women wo n't reverse roles ; they will be free to choose according to individual tal ents and preferences .
