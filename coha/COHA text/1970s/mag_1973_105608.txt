San Francisco Bay : 4:30 in the morning . I am later than planned because of the time it took to clear myself with a policeman who pulled me over in San Anselmo for " suspicious behavior . " Was it the generally fishy odor about the car that , in the end , convinced the law of my innocence ? I do n't know . In any case , we parted amicably . // I park the car near a maintenance station on the Marin County side of the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge . Frank has not arrived , so I decide to walk out on the span for a quick preview . // Along the way , rats scurry for cover behind a screen of shabby shrubs . These would not be big Norways , the kind you expect to see in the tropics sitting boldly in a palm while you sip rum and tonic on the veranda . No , the pusillanimous rodents that people my morning are inclined to cower behind slimy rocks near the freeway , struggling on an equal footing with Marfak for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crevices for the next colloidal high tide . // I brush past the PEDESTRIANS PROHIBITED sign , jump the low guardrail and trot to the second lamppost . There is no traffic in sight but from the north I hear a big diesel shift down on the bridge approach . He will be doing 70 when he reaches me so I hook one leg over the railing , grip the light standard and try to be inconspicuous . I would rather not be sucked under the wheels of a tractor-trailer full of rutabagas . He goes by with a blast and the bridge vibrates as his taillights fade away . I run to the next lamppost and look down . A dozen dark forms are finning in the shadow beneath the bridge . The largest is a striped bass of more than 30 pounds . To the right , a pod of smelt is easing near on a tangent certain to prompt an attack . The little fish are attracted by the brilliant light overhead . In their lack of purpose they seem ephemeral , like a quivering translucent curtain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and potent . In a moment the black shapes explode , sending the smelt showering away in a radius of flashing bodies . // Satisfied , I turn back and see a California Highway Patrol car coming at me , its nose down under heavy braking. // " What are you doing here , buddy ? " // " Going fishing as soon as it 's legal time . Just looking to see if there were any stripers. " // " That your car back at the maintenance building ? " // " Yes . " // " Better move it . It 's parked illegally . And do n't walk out here anymore . " // On my way to the car I see the patrolman who questioned me get out and look over the railing . Then the amber light is flashing and the driver is out , too . Together they lean over the side , pointing . // Frank 's blue sedan comes down off the ramp and turns south . When I reach him , he is untying his boat and I begin to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the water . In order to launch we must trespass . The land belongs to the state of California and although I 've never been verbally warned off , any number of KEEP OUT signs are posted . // For seven or eight years I kept a boat locked up behind a sign reading CABLE CROSSING . Once a year someone would repaint the sign , getting white paint on the chain . Some yards away in a blockhouse belonging to San Quentin penitentiary , trusties worked during the day . Each season they raised a handsome vegetable garden that I was careful never to disturb . // I often talked to one convict in particular . After fishing it would take a few minutes to put the boat back behind the sign and carry everything else to the car . If he saw me , he would call out in greeting and I 'd perhaps comment on the progress of the garden . Then he would ask about the fishing . He said he liked to go after stripers before he got Inside . // One December we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afterward , I went over to check the boat and all I could find was the chain . I was poking around the beach when I heard my friend 's voice . // " Looking for your boat ? " // " Guess the storm got it , " I replied . // " No , I saw it break loose the other morning and caught it . I dragged it up there , " he said , pointing . " Only thing I could n't find was the seat . " Beyond the garden I could see my trim little El Toro upside down on a pair of two-by-fours. // In recent years there have been no inmates at the blockhouse , and the garden lies fallow beneath wild anise . In a sense this has meant more license to trespass , but I stopped keeping a boat behind the sign when I knew there would be no trusty to look after it . // The morning is windless , overcast . Sunrise is only an hour away , yet the eastern horizon above San Pablo Bay is still dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Point Molate , for behind its quarried headlands lies the Standard Oil Company of California 's refinery , petroleum 's ode to the Cubists with its sprawl of cylinders , cones and rectangles . At Point San Quentin the flaring fires have become a familiar greeting , much like the glistening dew on a chokecherry bush that starts off the trout fisherman 's day in the Rockies . // " Did you look ? " Frank asks . // " They 're there . " // We row around the tilted bow of a derelict tugboat , then past rotted pilings left from the ferryboat days . Over on the approach a yellow bridge-patrol truck moves slowly , its warning lights flashing . Switching on a spotlight , the driver scans the water , catching sight of Frank and me . Then the light is turned off and the truck goes on toward the toll plaza . // Unseen overhead , a nighthawk rasps its singularly forlorn call . The smell of an institutional breakfast wafts unappetizingly across the water from San Quentin , an odor not unlike that of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections this morning , to be sure . // I visited Inside once when I was 16 and on a school tour . We saw the high comblike cellblocks , the laundry , woodshop , dusty yard and gas chamber  --  " the little green room . " Worst of all I saw the look of confinement on the faces of the hundreds of inmates . Whatever they had for breakfast , I felt certain it would not taste delicious . // There is a fast tide and we must row smartly to pass beneath the bridge , always dank and dripping . Sounds are amplified and echoed , especially that of wavelets slapping against pilings . Reflected light plays on the girders overhead , and just before we emerge I see several bass hovering at the edge but they sink from view almost at once . // Frank rows into the dark and I decide to try the first light . I drop a large buck-tail fly by the piling directly beneath the lamp where the current will swing it into the shadows . // Instantly there is a take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment when you wonder if the bass will go under the bridge and break the line on a sharp barnacle . But light pressure encourages them to dive toward the boat . Now my bass pulls into the dark and I try to gauge its size . If nothing else , it is a stubborn fish that resolutely resists all the strain I can manage on a 15-pound tippet . Eventually , I land it and mentally record a weight slightly above 20 pounds . // Frank is anchored under the third light where I see angular splashes as fish erupt under a school of bait . // It was Walt Mullen who showed me the bridge and how to fish it shortly after it was built . When we first met I was 16 and he more than 80 . My father had known Walt 's daughter back in the ' 20s when they were going to Stanford . " He loved to fish more than anyone I ever knew , " my dad recalls . // Mullen was a sign painter , wiry and spry , surely no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unpretentious and well hidden from casual customers . I wanted to learn the trade so I would often hang around , but my patience was too short and my business acumen nil . We always ended up talking about fishing . // One day he pulled a rumpled , paint-smeared tide book out of a little pocket in the front of his overalls . " See here , " he said , pointing to the numerals . " There 's a good tide in three days . Would you like to go out to the bridge ? " // At that point my experience was primarily academic so far as fly casting for striped bass was concerned . Walt did not fly-fish but he knew instinctively I would catch fish on the streamers I showed him . // I had read about certain pioneer anglers on the East Coast who caught striped bass by fly-fishing . Among them was Joe Brooks , the noted Virginian , who caught one weighing 29 pounds six ounces in 1948 out of Coos Bay , Ore . This fish was acknowledged as the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together regularly for several years . Then I married and became too busy and he closed his shop , moving his business into an adjoining county . Occasionally I would see him at the bridge . His eyes were failing and he did not trust himself in a boat anymore so he would cast from the rocks , often a futile gesture since the stripers rarely fed that close to shore . // One windy evening Bill Schaadt and I were in a boat at the third light . " Look . " Bill pointed . Hunched against the railing on the bridge , oblivious to speeding traffic and thoroughly unable to distinguish Bill or me , was Walt . He was clutching an enormous spinning rod , which he cocked back , then used to drive his lure in a trajectory that carried it over a school of bass I 'm sure he never saw . His face was locked in an expression of determination that made him look like an angling Ichabod Crane . // " Boy , " Bill said . " There 's a guy who likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we watched and stalked grimly back to the rocks to land it . // After that , many years passed during which I did not see Walt Mullen . Then one cold spring morning I was out at the bridge alone . I 'd begun going at odd hours and on poorish tides simply to avoid the noisome mob of trollers. // When it grew light I could see someone casting from the rocks . Walt ! I drew up my anchor and rowed in , circling widely so I would n't spoil anything . Close in I turned but could no longer see anyone . // Still excited , I went ashore . He could n't see me , I thought . But I could find no one even though I searched under the bridge and crossed the freeway to look on the other side . I felt a sense of loss , an uneasy melancholy . I went home . // Months later I found out Walt had died earlier that spring . // I row behind Frank . The bass are there , making heavy swirls as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Early commuters . They are too low in their cars to see us but the truck drivers usually wave or give a blast of the horn . It is getting light , a gray dawn that could be seriously depressing to a man looking forward to eight hours on the production line . // " The coldest winter I ever spent , " someone once wrote , " was a summer in San Francisco . " Perhaps this explains , in part , the centesimal suicides and high alcohol intake for which the City by the Bay is known . // We are virtually within sight of well over a million people , yet alone . We are perhaps out of step , ill-placed and ill-timed , in a sphere where cogs must mesh and all parts syncopate to keep the system running . // Even within the framework of angling as a popular endeavor , our methods are archaic : fly rods and rowboats . But we are touching something unrestricted , wild and arcane , beyond the reach of those who carefully maintain one-dimensional lives . There are people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature will be to step into diminutive piles of poodle excrement . // When I looked into the mirror during the late 1950s I saw a striped-bass fisherman who imagined , wrongly , that he was doing something remarkable and unique . The thought used to please me. // At the time , an elderly gent by the name of Ellis Springer was pierkeeper at the Marin Rod and Gun Club , whose facilities are situated only a few feet from the bridge . Ellis would let me use the club 's launching ramp , dock and fish-cleaning table even though I was not a member . Always in a light blue captain 's hat and smoking a stubby cigar , he was one of those people who talked at you . What made this particularly amusing was that his speech had a quality that made it impossible to understand anything he said . // I did not think he knew what fly-fishing was and wanted to let him in on my discovery . So one day when we were down at the dock I gave him a demonstration that seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper sense of wonder . I finished the exhibition by showing him some flies , which he studied for a moment . Then he looked at me with an expression of total confusion and exclaimed , " Yeehhh ! Hoopty poopty ! Hoopty poopty ! " // Such exclamations were a part of all subsequent conversations . // " Hi , Springer . " // " Yeehhh ! Hoopty poopty ! " // I used to carry fish around in the back of my car the way other young men carried a six-pack of Country Club . I 'd show Ellis and he 'd become truly frantic , waving his cigar . " Yeehhh ! Hoopty poopty ! Hoopty poopty ! " // Later I learned he called everything that was not a sardine filet a hoopty poopty. // Frank hooks a bass . I put my anchor down out of his way but still near enough to reach the school . I see two powerful boils and cast the bulky fly on a slow loop toward the swirl closest to a piling . In my eagerness I overshoot so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail and roadway . Then it flutters downward and I notice the number 9 stenciled on the abutment above . // The take is authoritative and my response lifts the clearly visible fly line from the water , curving it abruptly as a sheet of droplets limns the fish 's first long run . It is not a frenetic battle as the striper stays deep , far from the boat . But I am not inclined to carry out these contests gently and soon the fish is nearby . Once , glowering , it rushes away beneath a crescent of spray only to be turned in a vertical wallow . Nothing in their lives really prepares fish to deal with the relentless harassment of being hooked . // Oddly , I am reminded of the way Walt Mullen always described the playing of a fish . " Then it fooled around and fooled around , " he would say . And that is exactly it . // In the boat the striped bass is big . " It 's more than 25 , " I say to Frank . Earlier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man fly-fishing for shad in the Russian River . It seemed that a fish taken by design should receive top honors for the season . Naturally , we each hoped to catch such a bass . // Back at the beach we lay three large fish in front of the CABLE CROSSING sign . " That one 's bigger than the 30-pounder I caught on a casting rod last season , " Frank says . Getting his Polaroid camera he takes a picture of me with the fish . The photo comes out a minute later looking distant and journalistic . I promise to call him as soon as I weigh the bass . Then I head for San Rafael ; he goes off to work in San Francisco . // Later , I call . " It 's the big one , is n't it ? " Frank asks . " I 've been looking at the snapshot all morning . " // " Yes , 36 pounds six ounces . " // The record Brooks held for 18 years was broken . // That was 1966 and years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 pounds , and the latest record , of course , someday will be topped . Outside my Montana home a blizzard is raging . The familiar edges that normally define my yard  --  its fences , woodpile and barns  --  have vanished beneath the snow . My house , the last on an unpaved road among aspen and pine forests along the northwestern perimeter of the vast Absaroka Wilderness , is well on its way toward becoming a speck on the surface of a preposterous marshmallow . Unable to go out , I have sat , reminisced and revisited . For the angler remoteness , a romance with far places , threads through his finest memories . I moved to Big Sky country seeking remoteness . But for me , this day , it lies miles to the west , beneath a bridge in San Francisco Bay .
