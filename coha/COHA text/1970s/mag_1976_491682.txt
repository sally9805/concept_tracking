DR . FRANK H. NETTER : Michelangelo of Medicine In a certain sense , this is a story about hands . It is often said that the only difference between civilized man and his brutish caveman forebears is in his discovery and use of tools . But the finest tool of all  --  and there are about six billion of them at work today  --  is the one God created in the beginning , the human hand . It can create , destroy , caress . It is a miracle in the commonplace , the tool which has built all other tools . There are hands , and there are hands , of course . But , overlooking a few female digits which are of such exquisite proportions as to be an exercise in the language of aesthetics , whether waved in disdain or beckoned in desire , we honor most the hands which can do something , especially those of the artist and scientist . And right there is a frequent misconception . Can you visualize the hands of Jose Iturbi , the great piano virtuoso , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elongated , tapering hands of the romantic myth . They are square , strong , with blunt , short fingers  --  honest as a brick . But there is miracle in them , that of a workman at the glorious manual labor of his choice . We are looking at two such hands today , in the studio of Frank H. Netter , M.D. He is lighting a cigar with beautiful dexterity  --  not to mention an expression of enormous relish  --  and I can not take my eyes away from his hands . They have made him a surgeon honored in that high and lonely profession . And with those same doctor 's hands he paints not merely with extraordinary competence but with a genius which rumor has hinted places him as the foremost medical artist in the world . Dr. Netter is wholly unaware of these reverent thoughts . He is a man of too much vitality and mental agility to pause for self-contemplation . Born in 1906 , today he is as young-looking and fit as a man twenty years younger might hope to be . Good square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is a tiny , almost hidden lilt to his voice ( a baritone of assured conviction ) which suggests the faraway mysteries of his parents ' Ian- guages . This is overlaid with a suggestion of the New Yorkese ( brass brass ) effects of the city where he was brought up , all sustained with the eloquence of a highly articulate and educated man . Every now and then an odd thing happens to his face . He has a good head of hair as Noel Coward never did  --  but every once in a while Dr. Netter takes on the aquiline intensity of the Coward expression . It sounds like too much : but in a certain sense , Netter is too much . Those hands have created a career which , even cut in half  --  take him either as doctor or as artist  --  would he a triumph for most men . Well , here we sit . The Netter home is in Palm Beach County , Florida , where land along the beach sells for a reputed $1,700 a front foot , and Rolls-Royce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Netter is infected with that type of fever . He lives on an island within an island , surrounded by water , on Lake Worth . His home , in that stronghold of American maharajahs , is modest , but it is an oasis of taste on the inside . A small villa , almost classic in taste , with an inner garden and statuary at dramatic intervals . Although Dr. Netter is world famous for his anatomical drawings , there is no indication of this in the social rooms of the house . In the living room , which looks out on the obligatory swimming pool and some well-upholstered Florida scenery , is a Netter painting of the East River , New York City , romantic and misty as a Turner . Dominating the room is a Netter portrait of a woman  --  slim , chic , blonde and beautiful ; the subject is our hostess herself , Vera Netter . She is in serene harmony with the Louis Quatorze decor , the Aubusson rug , and the grand piano overlooking the view , where she preferably plays in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taste which comes at a very high price . We retire to Dr. Netter 's studio for our interview . Paintings on all sides from earlier days  --  a series depicting the life of a doctor ; a country doctor making a midnight call in the deep snow to deliver a baby ; medical students in a last despairing cram session before their exams ; a fresh young intern hovering over his first dissection of a corpse ; a class reunion of medical students , now mature , jolly , and somewhat sad ; and  --  shades of World War II ' ? a young medic doffing his officer 's jacket with a grin of delight , as he slips into the white coat of his profession once again before the delighted gaze of his family . Books everywhere : medical books , art books , novels , reference books . Part of a skull on the windowsill . But mostly this is a studio . This is where an artist works . Some artist ! He will shortly be celebrating the sale of the millionth copy containing his finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by CIBA , is evidence of the tremendous scope of his knowledge in that he has contributed to books whose titles include The Nervous System ; The Digestive System ; The Liver , Gall Bladder and Pancreas ; The Reproductive System ; The Endocrine System ; The Heart ; The Kidneys , Ureter and Bladder . His illustrations have also appeared in numerous other books and periodicals , notably in Clinical Symposia , which has consequently become the most widely read medical magazine in its class . In addition to these scholarly publications for the medical profession , Dr. Netter has also contributed to many lay periodicals such as The Saturday Evening Post , The Ladies ' Home Journal , Esquire , and The New York Times . He has just published a book , Fad Diets Can Be Deadly : The Safe Sure Way to Weight Loss and Good Nutrition . He believes that the public can benefit from a basic knowledge of the vast store of medical information . And he is a master at presenting this knowledge in easily understandable form . Dr. Netter leans back at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture window behind him revealing a passing series of Florida rain squalls , coffee for his guests at his right , and reminisces . He talks easily , with little jokes on himself peppering the recital . He smokes his perfecto a little like George Burns  --  savoring it , rolling it in his finger , clamping it in the corner of his mouth : " For some reason or another , there exists a rockbound rumor that I was born in Brooklyn . I do n't even know how Brooklyn got into the scenery . In fact , one of the few times I went to Brooklyn , I thought I 'd have to stay there forever because I could n't find my way back to Manhattan . " I was actually born in the middle of Manhattan Island ... on 53rd Street and Seventh Avenue . My wife was born a block away from me . And I 've always bawled her out because I had to chase her all the way out to Long Island years later to finally find her . " My father was a wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealt in automobile supplies . He died when I was twelve years old . Times were not very easy for us . Still , even then , when I was such a little kid  --  back as long as I can remember  --  all I wanted to do in the world was to make pictures . And that 's all I did . All day , every day . I was drawing all the time . I never thought of being a doctor . My ambition was to be an artist . And so when I was in grade school and high school I would draw pictures . Then , I heard that there was a place called the National Academy of Design where you could go and show your work and , if you had the talent , maybe they would let you come there and study . I showed them my stuff and they gave me a scholarship . I went there to study art at night and I thought of art all the time . I was as happy as could be but because of this my schoolwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , Frankie , where are you disappearing to afternoons and evenings ? ' And I told her I was going to art school . She said , ' Art school ! Well , that 's very nice . It 's nice to study art but it 's not a very good way for a young man to make a living . ' And she told me all about the evils of an artist 's life , you know , how dissolute it was and how they cavorted with nude models and drank a lot and so on . I really thought it did n't sound like such a bad life but I promised I would give more attention to my schoolwork and so she said , all right , she 'd let me continue with my art . " Later I studied at the Art Students ' League and with several wonderful private teachers . I remember one in particular who taught that making pictures involves not only the artist 's eye and hand but the eye , the brain and the board . In other words , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were depicting , not to copy it blindly as a camera would . For example , he would ask the students on one side of the room to draw the model as she would appear from the opposite side of the room and vice versa . Then he would have the model pose for fifteen minutes , and no one was allowed to draw  --  only to study the model . Then he would have her ( or him ) step down and he would then tell us to ' draw what you saw . ' To this day that training stands me in good stead . I seldom make sketches on the spot . I prefer to study and understand a subject thoroughly and then go back to my studio and paint my understanding of it . In that way my mind filters out the unessentials and I depict only the essence of the subject . " So I eventually became an artist . Those were the glorious days of commercial art . Back in the middle 1920 's the artist was the kingpin of the advertising world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't being used much yet . There was no television , and radio was only in its infancy . So the artist was the darling of the advertising world . If you could do good work , you could do very well financially . Which I did . The great commercial artists of those days were my heroes  --  J.C . Leyendecker , Norman Rockwell , Coles Phillips , Maxfield Parrish , Neysa McMein , Howard Chandler Christy , James Montgomery Flagg . They owned the advertising world . " I did all kinds of things , from advertising layout and design to advertising illustrations , to pretty girls for calendars and movie stars ' portraits . But my family still thought it was a very bad life for a young man to lead : he should do something more serious . So I finally succumbed and said , ' All right . I 'll quit the whole art business and become a doctor . ' I had time . I was still young . " So I went back to college , CCNY , to get my degree and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because of my art training , I found that I could learn my subjects best by making drawings for myself . Mine was a graphic viewpoint . My notebooks were crammed ( with illustrations . It was the only way I could remember things  --  just by making drawings . Eventually some of my professors noticed my drawings and they 'd ask me , ' I 'm writing an article . Would you make the illustrations for it ? ' Which I did  --  first to get on the right side of the professors , and second , for money because it was then beginning to run a little low  --  the nest egg I had saved up from my art work . I did this all through medical school and even through my internship at Bellevue Hospital in New York City . " Finally I went out into practice as a young surgeon . I was assistant to a very brilliant but very erratic surgeon in New York and the future seemed to hold promise . But the whole world had turned around . This was in 1933 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suchthing as medical practice . If a patient ever wandered into your office by mistake , he did n't pay you anyhow . So I thought I 'd go back to my art as a temporary expedient until my practice could get on its feet . I still had no idea of doing this as a career . There was one great coincidence at this point . " Around then the pharmaceutical manufacturers were beginning to develop some of their wonderful new products and looking about for ways to get information about these products to the medical profession . So some of them began to come to me for illustrations to dramatize the use of their products and so forth . One of the earliest did a whole series on the use of Novocain . Another series on minor surgery and things of that kind . " All this time , I felt sort of guilty ; I felt that I really should n't be devoting myself to the pictures . I should be devoting my time to my medical practice . But demand for my pictures was growing all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew that I 'd have to make a decision one of those days ... whether I was going to practice surgery or be an artist . " There 's a little incident which might have helped me a bit in making up my mind . About this time I was in my studio and combined medical office one day , and a man representing himself as an advertising manager for one of the large pharmaceutical companies came in and told me they were bringing out this new product and they wanted five pictures to illustrate its use . He told me the type of pictures Continued on page 74 Dr. Nettezr continued from page 67 they wanted and asked me how much I would charge for the pictures . So , I thought to myself , I should n't be doing this at all really . What I 'm going to do is tell him a very high price and he can just take it or leave it . That 'll end it . I was getting things like $50 per picture at the time , so I decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total of $1,500 . So I said , ' I 'll have to charge you $1,500 ! ' He said , ' Well , that 's very high and I 'll have to get an okay on that . I 'll call you tomorrow . ' I thought it was kind of funny that the advertising manager had to get permission to go spend $1,500 but anyway , I said okay ; and the next day he called me up and said , ' It 's all okay now ; and you can go ahead and do the pictures and we agree that the pictures will be $1,500 apiece . ' Fortunately , I was so shocked by this I did n't have a chance to correct him . " It was n't so much longer after this that I decided to give up my practice and devote myself exclusively to medical illustrations . I even did a transparent sculptured figure for the San Francisco Golden Gate Exposition of a woman with a synchronized voice which told the story of her endocrine and sexual development , the maturation of her sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth . The appropriate inner areas and organs would light up and then a voice would explain what was going on . She had a baby every fifteen minutes . You did n't see the delivery but you could see the baby grow to full term . She was a tremendous success . She was very beautiful . Larger than life : seven feet , four inches . " I continued to paint my pictures for different companies , and then the CIBA Pharmaceutical Products Company came to me and said that they had a heart control drug  --  digitalis  --  in preparation . The advertising manager had this idea to make a folder in the form of a heart . This would open up , and inside you would see the interior of an actual heart as I would paint it . On the face of this he would print his advertising copy . I painted the pictures , and he put the literature on it and mailed it out to the doctors . He began to get many requests for copies of this folder without all the printing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a human heart as it is . So he sent them out , compliments of CIBA , without the copy , just the drawings . The response was so tremendous that it was decided to do other organs the same way . We had discovered something different that doctors valued . So I did the kidneys and the lungs and various organs in that way  --  it was really just a method of teaching anatomy , a three-dimensional approach . And all this was so very successful , he asked , ' We'vedone the major organs and what can we do now that 's different ? ' And I said , ' Why do n't we do pathology ? ' CIBA then got out brochures on pathology  --  ten or twelve plates in a little folder . " The demand for these grew and grew to the point that CIBA just could not keep up with the requests for the back issues and thus had to keep all these things in print all the time . Until one very bright CIBA man , Mr. Paul Roder , conceived the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time and publishing them as a book , to be sold to the profession at cost . You know the rest . A million copies sold and more on my drawing board . The books have been sold in 119 countries . Thus began the world famous CIBA collection of medical illustrations . " It is regrettable , in all sorts of ways , that space does not permit the reproduction of many of the thousands of paintings Dr. Netter has rendered in his watercolors . They are a delight and a wonder of craftsmanship . Even beyond that is the evidence that behind each painting was the knowledge of the skilled surgeon who must have researched and researched until the precise and living organ or representation could be conveyed to the hands of the artist . It has been told how these comprehensive diagrams of human anatomy , and sometimes the physical aspects of various diseases and infections , play a significant role in medical progress in three general ways : they help students and physicians improve their understanding of how the body functions ; they are a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they provide a permanent record of medical achievement for future generations to build on . Dr. Netter made valuable contributions to training techniques in combat medicine during World War II . His recital of how that came about  --  in his own words  --  indicates a vein of humor which characteristically seems to run through much of his thinking and speech . " I knew a colonel in Washington at what was then known as the Army Medical Museum  --  now the Army Institute of Pathology  --  and he called me up and said , ' Look , Frank , you 're going to be in the Army and Lord knows what they 'll have you doing . We need your work here . We 're doing a lot of pathology studies . You might as well come in and do what you know how to do best . ' So I succumbed and enlisted and was assigned to the Army Medical Museum . I reported in my bright new captain 's uniform and the colonel said , ' Oh , come with me . I 'll take you up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Army Medical Museum where there was a really nice studio , all equipped and set up , and he said , Now , you 've got to remember that even though we 're doing this type of work here , you 're still in the Army and you must be here and available at all times when we want you . You 've got to be here at seven-thirty in the morning and not leave here until five o'clock in the afternoon . Whenever we want you  --  if you do go out , you leave word with the sergeant downstairs who will know where you are . ' I said , ' Yes , sir , I understand that . ' So , then , every morning at seven-thirty I was there . And I sat there . " I 'd come in every morning and sit there and sit there and I finally went down to the colonel and I said , ' You said you needed me to work here . Is n't there something you want me to do ? ' And he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some very important things coming along which we will need you for . But be patient . ' So I went back and I sat there and I read all the mystery books I could get hold of , and newspapers from cover to cover . This is what I would do all day long  --  sit and doodle and make little sketches for myself at times , but nobody came in or said anything to me . Every afternoon at five o'clock I would leave and that 's the way it went for about two months . And at intervals I would ask the colonel for work and he kept putting me off . " So then one day I was sitting in this room by myself as usual and the colonel showed up and he had a lieutenant with him . And he said , ' Captain , the lieutenant here will be assigned to you as your assistant . ' I did n't know what he was supposed to assist me with , but we now were two doing nothing . This fellow turned out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society sculptor and the army apparently did n't know what to do with this character , so they assigned him to me . When I would ask the Colonel what he wanted our team to do , he would still say , ' Be patient . ' Another month or so went by and the colonel again shows up and this time he 's got a sergeant with him . He says , ' Captain , the sergeant will be part of your staff . ' " About this time I was walking along the street and met an old schoolmate of mine also in uniform , and he said , ' What do you think of the service ? ' And I said , ' Arthur , one thing I am convinced of is that the United States is going to lose the war . We ca n't possibly win the war with what I see going on . ' Now there were three of us doing nothing . So in desperation I went to the colonel , and I said , ' Colonel , is n't there really something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff there . We can do things . ' He said , ' This is what I 've been waiting to assign to you . Come with me . ' He took me down to the cellar and there were boxes and boxes of human bones . Now , he said , ' This is a collection of bones from the French and Indian War . No one has ever separated the arrowhead wounds from the gunshot wounds and I would like you to work on them . ' I had enlisted in the army to fight for our country , and this is what I had come to , but there was nothing I could do about it . I did n't know at first whether the colonel was kidding or whether he was serious , but he was serious . So we went down in there and tried to figure out which is an arrowhead wound and which is a gunshot wound . " Well , one morning we were sitting in the studio , preparing ourselves to go down to the dungeon , and the telephone rang . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been there the telephone had never rung . In fact , we did n't even know where it was . Finally , I said I guessed as the ranking officer I 'd better answer it , so I picked up the phone and the voice on the other end said , ' Captain Netter ? This is General Weibie over at the Pentagon . ' I thought somebody was ribbing me . He said , ' I understand you have certain special qualifications for a job that I want to have done . Would you be good enough to come over here to see me at the Pentagon ? And I 'll tell you what it 's all about . ' So I said , ' Yes , sir , ' and I took a staff car and went over . The general turned out to be a swell fellow . He put me at ease , and then he pulled a book out of his desk . He threw it on the desk top and said , ' That 's the Army First Aid Manual . Now , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for chigger bites and snake bites and all sorts of things like that and also what to do for fractures and it gives you about fourteen different kinds of splints to use for a fractured arm  --  none of which are available on a battlefield . Besides , we have just eight hours to train combat troops in first aid , what to do for themselves or their companions if they are injured . You ca n't even read that book in eight hours . I 'd like you to develop for us something which would help these boys and tell them what to do to help themselves or their companions if they are injured . ' " This struck me as a real project to work on and so I went back and began to think about it . So I conceived the idea that I would show the soldier in pictures with types of injury he might incur in the war and what he could do to help himself or his companions under those circumstances , for each type of injury . Of course , I could only cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , but then I suddenly realized that I did n't know anything about combat . I did n't know what injuries could occur and what situations a soldier could find himself in . In all of my work , the biggest part of the job is to get the information and the knowledge and the understanding of the problem before you  --  making the pictures is easy after that . So . I began to go around and try to find out something about combat . Of course , Americans had n't even been in combat yet . The only officers I could find who knew something about combat , believe it or not , were over at the Russian Embassy . My lieutenant Nicky , who was a Russian , had contacted the embassy for me and he // introduced me to some of the Russian officers . They were very funny . They wanted to know everything I was doing , but they would n't tell me anything . The minute I 'd ask them anything at all they 'd clam up , or change the subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Army depends very much on the situation the soldier finds himself in . For example , first aid for a man at an artillery placement miles and miles behind the line is completely different from what it is in the midst of an assault . In an assault there is no such thing as first aid  --  just keep your head down and stop the bleeding if you can . Thus I not only had to work on the type of injury but the situation that the soldier was in . Well , I did this in pictorial sketches -- I did all pencil sketches at this point  --  and took it back to the general . In the meantime the colonel came up one day and he saw me sitting there making sketches and he said , ' What are you doing there ? ' And I told him , ' The general called me and asked me to do this . ' He said , ' Well , you tell that general if he wants you to do it , he should call me . ' " This was kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I did and the general was very nice and he said , ' Well , the colonel was right . I should have gone through channels before asking you . ' And he did ; he called the colonel and straightened it out . So anyway , when I finished it the general okayed the idea . Wow ! But then I found that , being an officer , I was not allowed to make the finished pictures . Making pictures was considered to be manual labor . So we got a staff assigned , and a lot of the pictures we commissioned to commercial studios for finished paintings to be made from my sketches . Well , anyway , it was a big success . They found that they could teach the boys something practical in eight hours in this way . I can say that I was partly responsible for the Army discovering the teaching value of pictures . " Well , the colonel was mad at me for doing this work and neglecting his bones , so I was transferred to the Surgeon General 's office and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Training Aids for the Training Division of the Medical Depart . ment of the United States Army . When the Army discovered the value of pictures , they began to come into all kinds of projects and I worked at planning such subjects as " Surviving in the Tropics , " " Surviving in the Arctic , " " Sanitation in the Field , " besides many technical manuals and surgical manuals . In civilian life it takes about two to three years to train an X-ray technician , but the Army wanted them trained in two months . So I did a pictorial manual on the operation of the Army X-ray equipment with pictures of the correct exposure , position of the patient , direction of the X-ray beam and so on . All pictorial , so a fellow could just look at it and follow it like a cookbook , to make X rays . " At this point , Dr. Netter noticed me looking at a set of his books , apparently in Chinese . " That series was done last April , " he explained . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association . It all started several years ago when a delegation of Chinese doctors was invited here and I got a call from a man in the State Department who said , ' I would like you to be on a committee to receive these Chinese doctors when they come here . ' I said , ' Well , I am very flattered but I wonder why you ask me when you have so many other distinguished doctors to invite . ' He answered , ' We decided you would be one of the doctors that they would know because of your work . ' Well , that turned out to be so . Some of them spoke no English at all but the head of the delegation was a man named Dr. Wu , who spoke English very fluently . He was a very charming man and also from my discussion with him , I gathered he was a very competent surgeon . We became quite friendly and since then we have corresponded . He sends me Chirstmas cards and beautiful Chinese things , and all the time I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since my business is to be on the forefront of medicine . There might be some important breakthrough which the Chinese may have known for thousands of years and which might teach us something . I was particularly interested in acupuncture . I was hearing so much about it , but I did n't believe in any of it . I thought it was absolute superstition and nonsense . Nevertheless a friend of mine  --  a great doctor , not a neurologist , a head and neck surgeon  --  who always was interested in what I was doing asked me if I was going to put acupuncture in a book I was revising on the nervous system . I looked at him and I said , ' Are you crazy ? ' And he said , ' Well , they 're doing it . I do n't know whether there 's anything to it or not , but you ought to look into it . ' So I wanted to go to China . I made an application through the Chinese Embassy in Canada , you see , because they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I forgot about it . Finally , after a year or so ( I had forgotten about the entire thing ) the invitation came through . We had submitted twenty-two names to the Chinese but the Chinese selected eight of us , and I was one . When CIBA heard I was going they got very interested in this and they gave us fifty complete sets of the books with the jackets in Chinese to take over there to give to them as gifts . Of course , I was very thrilled when I got there and found out that somehow they are moving so well behind the Bamboo Curtain in medicine and that they knew of my work and admired it . They were delighted with the books . I hope one of these days to picture this whole Chinese story . Not only in Chinese medicine but what I saw of Chinese life . When came back I had one thought that was dominant in my mind : ' God bless America . ' But just the same it was wonderful to discover how the Chinese have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how oppressed and exploited these people have been . As Edgar Snow has written , ' The Chinese have progressed from misery to poverty . ' But they are trying hard and they are working . The Chinese actually treated us wonderfully . They were the most courteous , most gracious people I 've ever met . One thing that struck me , from the minute I landed in China until the minute I left , was the complete dedication of these people to Chairman Mao , to Chinese communism , to their work and to China in general . I could n't help thinking , would n't it be wonderful if Americans , who have so much and get so much for so little that they do , could show a little bit of this same kind of dedication to their jobs and to their country . For example , in Canton they have what is known as the Chinese Trade Fair . The most tremendous buildings I 've ever seen . Here is displayed every product which is produced in China . The purpose is to sell it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . I remember chatting with the little Chinese girl delegated to us as our guide through this fair . I asked her , ' Is this your permanent job ? ' and she said , ' Oh , no , I am a second-year student at the Foreign Language Institute here with one more year to go and they sent me here as an exercise in foreign language training . I said , ' What do you think you 'll do when you get through and when you finish , what are your plans ? What are you going to do when you finish the foreign language school ? ' She looked at me in surprise and said , ' That is not for me to decide . ' Whatever she is assigned is what she will do . In China , you do what you 're told . This is true all over . Even the ones who are going to study medicine . No one decides he is going to be a doctor . They are selected by the commune or by their fellow workers . The ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine or engineering or whatever . I saw acupuncture finally . And I saw operations done with acupuncture anesthesia . Frankly I could n't believe what I was seeing , but I saw it . I saw open heart surgery . I saw gastrectomy and brain surgery and other operations done under acupuncture and the only thing the patient got was fifty milligrams of Demerol . And then the needles were put in and fifteen minutes later the operation proceeded . I must say I do n't think it was very good anesthesia . The patients showed some distress but mostly the surgeon was handicapped . In some cases he could n't do the things that I thought he should . But it did alter my attitude about acupuncture . An eminent professor of surgery at the University of California was along on this trip . He is one of America 's outstanding surgeons and he was also very skeptical about acupuncture . But after he and I went in and saw a number of these operations , I was so amazed at what I had seen that I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' And he said , ' Well , it was n't very good anesthesia . The patient showed some distress and the surgeon was handicapped . It was n't good anesthesia . ' I said , ' You missed the whole point . If a dog talks you should n't blame it for speaking poor English . The fact is that they did have anesthesia and they did do these operations under nothing but acupuncture . ' He said , ' Well , I 've got to admit something does happen . ' To me the important thing is something does happen and I think that it should be studied here . I do n't believe the Chinese are going to find out what 's going on in acupuncture because they are too handicapped by mysticism in connection with it , even the doctors themselves , the belief that the life force is flowing here and by putting a needle in such a place you 're putting the patient in harmony with the universe and this kind of thing , although / must admit they are trying to study it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern methods , just as we study our drugs . If we analyze what really is happening with acupuncture maybe there is some use for it in medicine after all . It is completely possible that it would be very useful in treating certain painful conditions , like arthritis , from which so many people suffer . " I even saw a Caesarean section by acupuncture , but I do n't think they use it very much in ordinary obstetrical deliveries . I do n't think it would ever be useful for anesthesia in the United States because our anesthesia is so perfected that the patient does n't know anything . He just goes to sleep and wakes up when the operation 's over , without any bad effects . When I was in medical school with the ether mask , the patient was retching and ripping the sutures out and so on , and the misery of the anesthesia was worse in the patient 's experience than the operation .

For example , we went to many medical schools and hospitals , and everywhere we first went into a sort of conference room where the head of the institution would give a little dissertation about his institution and what goes on there , and invariably he would start with exactly the same phrase , ' According to the teachings of our great leader , Chairman Mao , we are doing ' so and so . As far as dates go , everything dated from the cultural revolution , as the beginning of things . The phraseology was so much the same I began to wonderwhether this was memorized and whether they must say it if they are going to keep their jobs . " On the other hand I must say that to a certain degree I did have a great admiration for their dedication to what they 're doing . They 've accomplished much . For example , they have pretty well wiped out all venereal disease , which was once prevalent , and have brought other medical scourges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under control . There is practically no alcohol or drug problem in China . Their medical standards in general are very good , and in some fields like the replantation of accidentally severed limbs and fingers they appear to be ahead of us . " The Chinese manufacture their own drugs . I told the CIBA people when I came back , ' You know , you 're not going to get much business out of China . They will buy the stuff in the beginning , and then they 'll make it themselves after analysis . They do n't recognize such things as the international patent codes . They are making their own antibiotics and other sophisticated drugs : in fact , they claim they have some which are superior to ours . ' " The Chinese have strict controls on their birth control program . This is their own doing , of course ; and they recognize that with 800 million people multiplying geometrically , pretty soon there would be no place for anybody to stand , much less food to feed them , so they have very intensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They use pills and intrauterine devices . They explained those to us , and I remarked later to an obstetrician who was with us , There is one method they have not mentioned that they use very intensively here , and that 's the way women dress . ' Until recently , women in China were not permitted to wear dresses . They wore baggy pants and jackets , the same as men . Exactly the same clothes . No difference in clothes , no difference in labor . The have carried women 's liberation to the extreme . You see women carrying big burdens on their backs and pulling the wagons and the boats on the river towed by hand . The women were to dig the ditches and everything the same as men . " Dr. Netter is a man who enjoys thinking out loud , as he had been all this time , and one could listen to him for a long time without wishing the flow to stop . He mentions his life in Florida . He is a golfer . And perhaps some measure of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his studio . Each one represents a hole-in-one the doctor has shot . Those marvelous hands which guide the surgeon 's knife and the artist 's brush so marvelously do not  --  it is very clear  --  noticeably lose their magic touch when you put a driver or an iron in them ; they clout the ball straight down the fairway. 2
