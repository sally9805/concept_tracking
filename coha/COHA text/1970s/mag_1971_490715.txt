SPRING came late to Moscow this year . It snowed almost every day in Easter week , and the temperature was at freezing . But Passion Saturday , as the Russians call the day , before Orthodox Easter , the fine weather began , and Muscovites with rubles turned out in large numbers to do what they like best in the world , which is to buy stuff . The fancy shops along Kalinin Prospekt hustled the way those on Fifth Avenue would if Madison , Lexington , and Third did n't exist . Long lines formed outside a store selling photographic equipment . At a florist 's next door , there were hundreds of women and men , including many Army officers , buying roses in bundles of two to a customer . Young people stood three and four deep at the counters of a record shop , mainly buying , as far as I could judge , the nineteenth-century romantics  --  Bizet , Men de Issohn , and Rimski-Korsakov . Vivaldi and Bach were requested , but not to be had . Delicacies were also in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual , there was a joke on die subject going the rounds . It tells of a man who approaches a counter in a market and asks , " Do n't you have any caviar at this counter ? " " Of course not , " the sales clerk replies indignantly . " At this counter we do n't have meat . At the next counter we do n't have caviar . " Buying what is available , however , has become much easier . The last time I was in Moscow , hack in 1967 , customers always waited in line three times to make a purchase  --  first to pick out what they wanted and to get a chit with the price , next to pay for the artick at a cashier 's booth and have the chit stamped , and then to pick up the article by presenting the receipt at the original counter . The length of time spent in line , in fact , became a measure of quality . " What a wonderful pair of stockings I bought today ! " a woman would exclaim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . " But now the supermarket principle is coming in . Just around the corner from Kalinin Prospekt , in the Gastronom an Tchaikovsk ) Street , customers walked in , picked out the food items they wanted , paid a cashier , and walked out . The problem of not pushing people out of jobs  --  a sacred principle in Russia , sometimes known as featherbedding in the United States  --  had been met by having the extra employees detailed to watching for shoplifters . A bigger problem was that of providing a variety of goods ; only carrots and potatoes in sacks , canned foods , and wines from Georgia were available . The pickings were even slimmer in the leather-goods section of a department store . Four different kinds of handbags were available all brown , all plastic , all square in shape , and all with a metal clasp on top . Women stood for several minutes sniffing and poking , and then walked away . I clocked one interval of ten minutes without a sale . Later , the wife of an American journalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet women was the lack of variety . " Even diaphragms come in only two sizes , " she said . Passion Saturday also happened to be a Subbotnik , or Working Saturday  --  a day of some ideological and political significance . The idea , ordained by Lenin , is that one Saturday in April the people of Russia should work for nothing in order to build Communism . The custom , abandoned for a while , has been revived in recent years . There was one at the time of Lenin 's hundredth birthday , in 1970 . This year , the occasion was the Twenty-fourth Congress of the Communist Party , which ran from March 30th through April 9th . The advance buildup for this Subbotnik was terrific . There were posters advertising the event all over town . Exhortations to get out and work had prime time on television Friday night , and front-page notices in lzrestia and Pro-is/a . The turnout in factories and office buildings was said to he large ( one factory claimed in a May Day Parade poster to have built four hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city where streets were cleaned and walls painted by volunteer workers , but the disposition to volunteer was not overwhelming . One Russian told me that the service he performed on Subbotnik was to wash his car . An American girl who visited Leningrad that day expressed surprise to her taxi-driver that the Suhhotnik applied there as well as in Moscow . " Yes , " he said , " it 's Subbotnik here , ton . But it 's only Subbotnik for the Communist Party . " In Moscow , at a small park off Tchaikovsky Street , I watched a few children with rakes turning up the ground around some birch trees . A group of elderly men , in black suits and melon-shaped felt hats , stood gossiping , brooms in hand . Occasionally , a couple of them would drag their brooms over a patch of hardened earth , as though they were ground-keepers at Yankee Stadium carefully smoothing the infield . I asked a Russian who was with me what they were supposed to be doing . " They 're intellectuals , " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work . " THAT Russians are more interested in buying things than in showing the dignity of work has not been lost on the leaders of the Communist Party . Emphasis on increased production of consumer goods was one of the two main features of the Twenty-fourth Party Congress . The ninth five-year plan adopted by the Congress calls , for the first time in Soviet history , for larger growth in consumer-goods production than in the output of heavy industry . While promises of more consumer goods have been regularly aired since the Stalin era , the accent is different now . Khrushchev used to run on about more milk and butter and clothes , the better to overtake the United States and put down Communist China . But Leonid Brezhnev , who succeeded Khrushchev as First Secretary , plumps for consumer goods as something necessary for the Soviet Union on their own merits . " Raising the standard of living , " Brezhnev said flatly in his main report to the Twenty-fourth Party Congress , " is the supreme aim of the Party 's economic policy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for me with particular force by Georgi Arhatov , the head of the U.S.A. Institute of the Academy of Sciences , in Moscow , who is reckoned to be the man most deeply involved in advising the Soviet leadership on American affairs . He is Russia 's main Americanologist , so to speak . In a chat with him at the Institute , I mentioned my feeling that Khrushchev pushed for consumer-goods production as an expression of invidious state power , and that Brezhnev was voicing a different rationale . I said , " Brezhnev spoke of consumer goods as something he wanted for ? " At that point , I began to fumble for the right word . " For all the people , " Arhatov said , finishing the sentence for mc . The same point was stressed by a leading commentator for the Novosti news agency , Spartak Beglov . Beglov referred to the Party Congress as the " realistic Congress . " It had come to be understood , he said , that " if you want to do big things you ca n't rely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " People need to have their ideological interests reinforced by material interests . " The other big development at the Congress , of course , was the emergence of Brezhnev as the undisputed No. 1 in Soviet politics . During the Congress , he visibly outdistanced in all kinds of ways all other Soviet leaders and interest groups . His opening and closing addresses were broadcast full-length and live on television . He read aloud and in order of rank the membership of the newly elected Politburo . The formal Pravda announcement of the event declared that Brezhnev had been " unanimously elected " General Secretary of the Party , and then listed in alphabetical order the names of those who had been named to the Politburo . In Brezhnev 's listing by order of rank , Premier Alexei Kosygin was named third ( below Brezhnev and Soviet President Nikolai Podgorny ) in the Politburo  --  a sign that , however important his responsibilities may be , he is no challenger to the chief . One supposed challenger , Alexander Shelepin , dropped from seventh to eleventh place in the Politburo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to he moving up , Yuri Andropew , the secret-police boss , stayed just where he had been  --  a candidate member of the Politburo . With all these men checked , something like a Brezhnev cult is inevitably beginning to build up . But the selling of the General Secretary is Ills : selling of a modest image . When I asked Arhatov what Russians thought of Brezhnev , he replied , " The strength of Comrade Brezhnev is that he feels the needs of ordinary people . He does not have a snobbish attitude . He is not afraid to emphasize such things as services in the economy . " WITH economic improvement for ordinary men as its appeal , the Party no longer has to depend on ideology as the sole source of faith and inspiration . Ideology is freed , so to speak , to serve almost exclusively as a standard of orthodoxy , a control on the spread of ideas and attitudes that the regime finds distasteful . The tight-ening of the line expected by many to he proclaimed at the Twenty-fourth Party Congress through renewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it hardly had to . The artistic flowering that was fostered by Khrushchev 's de-Stalinization cam-paign was cut off by the trial and sentenc-ing of the writers Andrei Sinyaysky and Yuli Daniel in 1966 , and the cultural scene in Moscow now registers the results every day . High technical pro-ficiency remains the rule in such traditional art forms as ballet , in-strumental music , and theatre . But there is noticeable tension between media and message . In an eve-ning at the Central Puppet Theatre , for example , I found the manipulation of the marionettes as matchless as ever , but the material was at the Ed Sullivan level . The performance , a kind of slap-stick variety show , was called " An Un-common Concert " ? a lowbrow parody of the title of a highbrow novel by Ivan Goncharov called " A Common Story . " The skits included a French chanteuse in a slinky black dress singing " Ton-jours I'Amour , Toujours ; " three Mexican guitarists , dressed in som-breros and serapes , singing a song that went " Ole , ole tom/ Viva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Volga Boatman ; " and some tap-dancers ; bow tics and straw boaters . A soprano with a huge bust and a squeaky voice took a how after singing a selection from " Carmen , " and broke up the place when her behind hit the piano and sent it skidding across the stage . The master of ceremonies had lines such as " The author of the following piece of music is  --  the composer . " At one point , he compared Russian humor to the figure for cement production announced every year by the Party leaders : " It gets heavier and heavier . " A current play ? " Svoy Ostrov , " or " One 's Own Island " ? tells die story of three Estonian students who , having failed their examinations , go to work for an older man who is desperately in ing to conserve land by eliminating strip-mining . In the end , he succeeds and everybody is happy . But along the way there are some unorthodox touches . At one point , in a surprisingly frank expression of generation-gap anguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is anything in the world that is worth believing in . " The role of ideology in education is ridiculed when one student laments , " Those who see everything clearly pass their exams . " There is even a knock at bureaucrats who are interested only in fulfilling the plan , no matter what the consequences . ( One bureaucrat draws a laugh by saying , " We have planning organizations , and they undoubtedly think . " ) Stein-beck is quoted in the play , as is the controversial Leningrad poetess Akhmatova . The music and some of the dance patterns arc From " Hair . " Suffusing the whole play is a theme that seems about as strange to current Russian drama as the Age of Aquarius is to the Age of Brezhnev . It is the difficulty ' of finding a place in society  --  of not being one 's own island . Probably the most popular film going is " Beg , " or " Flight , " a story about the Russian Revolution that some say is the Soviet answer to " Doctor Zhivago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had been banned because of its supposed sympathy for the antirevolutionary cause . In the film , the Whites do not come off as entirely had guys . They come if as clowns , instead , and the Communist military hero Mikhail Frunze is represented as a saintly figure with the military genius of Napoleon . Another widely publicized movie , " One of Our Own , " centers on the N.K.V.D. , the secret police who conducted the purges of the Stalin era . The action is set on the eve of Russia 's entry into the war , in 1941 , and the story tells of N.K.V.D. efforts to uncover a Nazi spy ring and some would-he Russian collaborators . The N.K.V.D. men arc heroic figures  --  professional , calm , benevolent , and good athletes to boot . Naturally , they apprehend both the Germans and the collaborators , who are turned two to the courts . The obvious message is that national-security considerations justified the purges of the nineteen-thirties . A glittering musical event at the Moscow Conservatory in late April featured the pianist Svya tosla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , significantly , the occasion was a visit by the London Symphony Orchestra , with Benjamin Britten conducting a concerto specially written for Rostropovich . Another cultural event of note in the last few weeks was an anniversary the four-hundredth performance at the Taganka Theatre of " Anti-worlds , " a play produced from the poetry of Andrei Voznescnsky . Much of the verse is intensely dramatic . " The Skull Ballad , " for example , tells how Peter the Great executed an unfaithful mistress , Anna Mons , by himself striking off her head , which in the translation of Stanley Kunici " rolls from the blow of his axe to the toe of his hunter 's hoot . " Suddenly the severed head begins to speak : " Beloved one 0 worshipful Czar I will not judge thy guilt but why do thy hands stick to my skin and taste of my own heart 's salt ? Let me confess my womanhood my crime deserves the whip I tremble where that crimson fleck hangs on thy bristling lip . Love is so small who cares for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small Taganka Theatre was filled , and people stood in the aisles . There was prolonged , rhythmic applause at the end , and tulips and roses were presented to the performers . Voznesensky then rose to read a few recent verses his first public reading , I was told , in several years . He stood there , a slight , boyish figure , dressed in a black leather jacket , a white turtleneck sweater , and flannel trousers . Two of his new poems were dirges the first for a revolutionary Latin-American poet killed by the police in his homeland ; the second for a Russian university student , Svetlana Popova , who died two years ago in the cold of Northern Siberia , reciting his poems . A third poem he read was a " humorous requiem " for the star of the play , an actor and musician named Volodva Vysotskiy , who has had some difficult% with the authorities . In another poem . Voine.sensk ) spoke of himself . " I can not write in times like this , " he said according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the other poets in the NVriters ' Union will write my poems for Inc . " It was his special stock-in-trade  --  the hitter , ironic thrust . The audience clapped and clapped and clapped . THE Russian who was with me at the performance who had , in fact , made it possible for me to get in to the Taganka on that memorable evening  --  was a poet with whom Voznesensky is frequently associated , Yevgeny Yevtushenko . I had met Yevtushenko a couple of days before at a dinner given by Edmund Stevens , the veteran Moscow correspondent who now works for the San Francisco Chronicle . Yevtushenko looked much more youthful than his thirty-eight years  --  tall and thin , with a fresh country-boy face and regular , slightly nicotine-stained teeth , which were much in evidence , He wore the most conventional suit  --  a dark-blue pin-stripe with narrow lapels . He had just had a yellow-fever shot ( in preparation for a trip to Peru ) , and at first was reluctant to drink . But , once started , he drank and talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly from subject to subject in the almost random fashion of the characters in Russian novels . I asked Yevtushenko about a pin he had on his lapel . He said , " It was given to inc by the workers on the Bratsk Darn in honor of the poem I wrote about Bratsk . There are not many of these pins , and I am very proud of it . I come from Siberia , you know . I killed a hear with a knife when I was only twelve . You should never underestimate the provinces . The provinces make history , especially in Russia , which is a very big country . We have a saying that in Moscow they usually punish a man by clipping his nails , while in the provinces we cut off his hand ; but when they cut off a man 's head in Moscow , in the provinces we only shave his hair . I remember at the time of my greatest troubles here , when all the papers were screaming against me , I went to the Siberian region , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and everybody was cheering and shouting . I asked the Party , chairman if he would n't get into trouble giving me such a welcome when I was nut of favor in Moscow . He said , ' No , no , no . You must remember that here the sun rises five hours before it rises in Moscow . ' " I mentioned a woman we both happened to know . Yevtushenko said she was na  --  ve . I said that being naive was not so had , and , to provoke him , cited Alvosha in " The Brothers Karamazov " and Myshkin in " The Idiot . " He said , " Alyosha and Myshkm were not na  --  ve . They were pure . There is a difference . " Then , as if to make amends in case I should feel offended , he added , " But you are right . It is better to be naive than cynical . Take Stalin , for instance  --  he only referred to Don Quixote in a contemptuous way . " I asked what Stalin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hc did n't say anything about Sancho . Stalin 's character does n't come out of Cervantes . It comes from Dostoevski  --  from ' The Possessed . ' Once when I was in A/lexica reading to some radical youth , I was asked what was my bedside reading of a revolutionary nature . I replied , ' The Possessed . ' Our cultural attache was by my side , and he at once began tugging at my sleeve , asking me what the hook was . But the young people there knew well enough that it was a hook about the danger of revolutionary ideas , and they began to shout angrily . Then an old man , a Mexican , stood up . He said , ' Listen . Something wonderful has happened . A Russian has said that Dostoevski is the greatest writer on revolution . ' That silenced them , and they did n't tear me limb from limb after all . " About his own work Yevtushenko was much less effusive . He has a new play about the United States , " Under the Skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Taganka Theatre . " It 's a string of monologues , " he said . " By Jesus Christ , by John Kennedy and Robert Kennedy , by Pancho Villa , and by me . " I had heard that he was having some trouble about the play , and asked whether it would be produced soon . Somewhat despondently , he said , " There is a big word in the Russian language , probably the biggest word --  - maybe . " ASAYING among Russian intellectuals is that Soviet society is like a layer cake  --  the workers on top , the peasants on the bottom , and the intellectuals squeezed in between . Certainly there is no widespread popular sympathy for the plight of the intellectuals or alarm over the decline of cultural activities . Thousands of Russians , maybe even millions , must have read the works of Alexander Solzhenit- n , though only a few short stories and a single novel , " One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich , " have been allowed to appear here . But very few people have protested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these few is the cellist Rostropovich , who has taken Solzhenitsy n under his wing as a kind of ward and given him a place to live . in his home . ' While part of the reason nobody protests is fear , a morn important consideration is that hardly anybody seems to care . The availability of refrigerators and radios and other consumer goods has caused most Russians to go in for getting and spending as never before . Moreover , as the 1970 census figures which began to appear in April reveal , many Soviet citi-zens are moving upward on the social ladder . Western accounts of the census emphasized chiefly the population figures . The growth since the last census , in 1959 , was slight  --  a little over one per cent annually . Women outnumbered men , a hundred and thirty million to a hundred and eleven million  --  a continuing sign of the toll taken by the war . While Great Russians , to the surprise of many , continued to he a majority ( fifty-three per Cent ) , the predominance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been doubling their number every twenty years , replaced the B3elorussians as the third-largest nationality , behind the Great Russians and the Ukrainians . To the surprise of practically everybody , and the suspicion of not a few , the number of Jews in the Soviet Union , which had been estimated by the Novosti news agency as three million , actually came in at 2.151 million  --  a decline from the 1959 figure of 2.268 million , and the only decline registered by any important nationalist group since the 1959 census . But Russians , not looking for negative indicators , could find plenty of reasons for self-congratulation in the census . In education , particularly , there was an impressive rise . Those in the working force with a college degree more than doubled from 1959 to 1970 . Those with a vocational-highschool education rose from 6.6 million in 1959 to 12.1 million in 1970 . The number with more than an eighth-grade education rose from forty-three million in 1959 to seventy-five million in 1970 . Perhaps the most revealing numbers had to do with the urhan-ruralbalance . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villages of its endless , sad plains ; fifty-two per cent of the population lived on the land . During the next decade , the balance shifted . In 1970 , fifty-six per cent of all Russians lived in towns and cities . The Soviet Union , in other words , is now experiencing the headlong move of millions from country to city that has been in almost all nations a prime source of individual opportunity and economic growth . Because of the restrictions of the Soviet system , these opportunities are open chiefly to men ready to take chances  --  to enterprising operators . In-deed , it still takes a certain amount of wheeling and dealing to acquire an apartment , a television set , or a dacha , not to mention those supreme features of gracious living , a car and a trip abroad . Most of the acquisitive arrange-ments are made behind the scenes , away from the eyes of authority and foreign visitors . But hustling is too commonplace to he concealed CulTIplcUr-ly . One good sampling of how operators work can be found in the collective-farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market on i'svctnoy Boulevard is a huge hall filled with little exhibition stands at which farm-ers from the countryside , many of them from hundreds of miles away , have laid out foodstuffs ? nuts , apples , pears , pickles , dried fruit , eggplants , and just about everything else that grows . Though the prices arc about double , those in the state stores , the superior quality draws a steady flow of customers , who come from all over Moscow , by taxi and private car and bus and subway , to do their shop-ping . I spoke briefly , through an Intourist guide , with one of the venders . He was an Uzbek from Tashkent , and he wore an embroidered red hat , something like a fez . He and a small son had come up from Tash-kent by train  --  a two-day trip . They had filled half a dozen suitcases , which now stood empty beside the stall , with tomatoes and dried apri-cots . They had bedded down for the past three nights in a dormitory above the market , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sold almost everything they had brought . I asked him if he had had a chance to do much sightseeing in Moscow . " Not much , " he said with a grin . I asked if he had seen the tomb of Lenin . " Why do n't you have an apricot ? " he asked , grinning more broadly . " They 're very good . " And they were . N a more spectacular level of wheeling and dealing , there is the case of Victor Louis . Louis , a Russian , is the Moscow correspondent of the London Evening News and the author of a popular guide to Moscow . Various murky activities , such as supplying unkind family photographs fer the memoirs of Stalin 's daughter , Svetlana Alliluyeva , and an ambiguous association with the publication of the Khru &whey; memoirs a broad , have led many people to suspect that he is an agent for the secret police , charged with spreading misinformation . Harsh articles have been written about him by Herbert Gold , for the New York Times Magazine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I was surprised when he responded to a phone call with a cheery invitation to Sunday lunch at his dacha , about ten miles west of Moscow . I asked him in the first minutes how he felt about the Gold and Karnow articles , and he allowed that he felt they had been unfair . " Still , " he said with a smile , " it 's good publicity . " He then took me on a tour of the very accommodations that had attracted so much criticism and suspicion a spacious house in the woods , with TV sets , a sauna , a living room full of lovely icons and antique furniture , and a cellar stocked with Danish beer and Cokes and French champagne . In the garage were a Mercedes and a Porsche , and all kinds of tools , including welding equipment , used , even on Sunday , by a man who works for Louis and also services the cars of his neighbors , friends , and acquaintances . There was a tennis court , strung with overhead lights , and used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ice-skating rink . " Now , " he said , again with a smile , " I 'm going to show you something nobody else has written about  --  something that you can use as your own story . I 'm going to show you where I 'm going to build my swimming pool . " Louis told me that he had recently been invited to lecture at Harvard . I asked him what- his subject would be . " The difficulty of getting an American visa , " he replied sharply . Then he told me a long , rambling , and not altogether coherent story about past difficulties he had had in travelling in the United States , about the delay he had encountered in getting a response to his inquiries this time , and about an insulting State Department questionnaire that he would not fill out . He showed me a map of the world with pins in almost every country . Those were all the nations he had visited ? " mostly , " he said , " on a transit visa . " That brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States he was n't get-ting  --  and in my view was n't trying very hard to get . He began denying charges made in American papers about his connections with the secret police . He said , " I am a correspondent for a foreign newspaper , and my wife is a British citizen . We have no privileges that other foreign correspondents do n't have . I just work harder . I produce guidebooks and sell pictures abroad . I learned long ago that I can write an article for one of your newspapers on the basis of four clippings . Sure , I like French champagne and German cars . Why not ? Nothing I do is illegal , and nobody has ever proved anything against me . What I do is the same as the millionaires in your country who take tax exemptions , or the shipowners who sail their boats under the flag of Panama or Liberia . " Later , Louis talked at length about tourism , about which he is an expert . He spoke of the unexplored , ancient towns of Russia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Mark Twain spent his youth . " You do n't know what Mark Twain means to Russians , " he told me . " We grow up with Tom Sawyer and with Huck Finn . So when I was in Hannibal wanted something that had on it the touch of Mark Twain , something with a local meaning . Hut the only souvenirs there were made in Japan . The trouble with you Americans is you 're too rich . You buy everything . You do n't make anything for yourselves anymore . There arc things people have to do for themselves . " N least one group in Russia has not been attracted by the opportunities for better living so relentlessly exploited by Victor Louis . Because of its revolutionary idealism , Communism once exerted a special appeal to the oppressed Jews living in the Russian Pale . " I am a revolutionary , not a Jew , " Trotsky said , and Lenin concluded that lows " with their stubbornness and fa . naticism make excellent revolutionaries . " But the continuation of anti-Semitism in Russia and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were once keen Communists to turn to Zionism . That , at least , seemed to he the case with a group of Jews I encountered in Moscow . Friends in Washington had given the the name and Moscow address of a Zionist , and I set nut to visit him one evening about nine . I gave no warning- of my visit and moved furtively , stopping to look in store windows , and crossing streets and looping around blocks . Though my tactics were ridiculous ) ) amateurish , I was quite confident when I rang the doorbell that I had not been followed . My host was playing cards and received me casually , as though it were nothing unusual to have an unknown visitor from America drop in unannounced after dinner . At first , it seemed to me that all my precautions had been silly , that , in fact , the man was advertising , not hiding , his activities . He wore a rabbi 's heard and his son had plastered a Star of David on his black leather jacket . Around the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Golda Meir and Moshe Dayan and the founder of Zionism , Theodor Herzl . But when I started to speak my host pointed toward the ceiling in the way Russians have of indicating a place is hugged . He brought out pencil and paper , and wrote down answers in English in response to my written questions . These were some of the exchanges : 0 : Were you always a Zionist or is it recent ? A : Four or five years ago I came to it Q : Why ? A : 1 saw how Joys Lived in our country . I got information about Israel . I thought what Israel could he if many Jews were there , and so I understood that I must be there  --  I and my sons . Q : What do you do professionally ? A : I am an engineer in radio electronics . 0 : What kind of discrimination have you encountered ? A : I ended the institute in 1950 . I could not get a job for half a year . Ma father lost his job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . Last year my son could not enter the institute because he is a Jew . Q : Do ordinary Russians sympathize with you ? A : Some Russians . But few sympathize with us . But few . Before I left , he gave me an eight-page typewritten account of a protest he and thirty-eight other Jews had made on March 25th to the Supreme Soviet about pending trials of Jews in Leningrad , Riga , and Kishinev . As we stood in the stairwell , I asked him how he happened to have such a good apartment ; the answer was that it had been given to his father , who had once been a Communist in good standing . Then we made arrangements for another meeting with some of his fellow-Zionists . He picked me up , by prearrangement , outside the main Moscow Post Office , on Gorky Street , and we drove in a taxi to a southeastern suburb . After making a phone call , he led me to an apartment in a housing project . A man , a woman , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apartment , and we were soon joined by several more men . There was no inhibition about speaking . I talked mainly with the woman , whose English was very good , and one of the men , who was a professor and liked to talk . The professor sketched out the contradictory impulses that inhibited the regime in its dealing with the Jews . He said the official policy was assimilation , and that many Soviet leaders wanted to take Jews in on an equal basis as individuals . Others , he said , were afraid . " They 're afraid of us . They 're even more afraid of the Ukrainians and the Baltic peoples and the Turkish peoples , whom they would also have to take in . Sometimes the Russians improve their standing with the other nationalities at our expense . Things are very had for Jews in the Ukraine , Moldavia , and the Baltic States . " His theory was that when the contradiction between assimilation and persecution became intense , the regime relieved the pressure on itself by letting more Jews emigrate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection the trials of Jews in Leningrad , Riga , and Kishinev seemed to him a big opportunity . He said , " Everybody knows the evidence is bogus  --  cooked . The leaders go through with the trials only because the police insist . But the regime is very sensitive to outside pressure and protests . I do n't mean destroying buildings or anything violent . That 's very had . But loud popular protests are effective . Especially against the trials . That 's what helps us . " The woman told me that her husband was an engineer in a government department , and had been a Communist Party member for twenty-six years ; that she had been an interpreter ; and that her daughter had been a computer analyst . Since indicating a desire to go to Israel some months ago , the woman had been fired , her husband had been expelled from the Communist Party , and her daughter demoted to secretary . " We live well here , " she said . " About as well as anybody can in this country . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She told me the main push to go to Israel came from the young people , and I then noticed that her daughter wore a necklace with a Star of David as pendant . " Many of us who arc older have known had moments and fear , " the woman said . " We have hesitations . But not the young . Nothing can stop them . " AFERVOR equal in intensity but very different in focus I found among many of the Christians who turned out for Orthodox services on Easter Eve . At the Church of All Mourners , just across the Moskva River from die Kremlin , where I went with the American consul , Peter Swiers , and his wife , a couple of thousand people stood packed together through hours of worship . The press was so great that several persons fainted . Most of the worshippers were middle-aged women , heads wrapped in newly washed scarves . They crossed themselves passionately when the prayers began , and rocked hack and forth to the rhythm of the music . There were golden candelabra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the saints , a choir and priest in medieval robes . Candles were sold at the hack of the nave and were held throughout the service . At midnight , all the lights went up , and the priest led a procession around the outside of the church in a symbolic search for the body of Christ . Then he returned to the altar and cried out , " Christ is risen ! " " He is truly risen ! " the congregation chanted in response . And for the next half hour , in staccato bursts , that exchange echoed over and over again . A fair sprinkling of young people were on hand , both inside the church and standing just outside the doors . They smiled indulgently at the passing of the candles and the procession around the church , but they were all quite well behaved . I was told , however , of incidents at other service , particularly in the main cathedral , where bullies from the Young Communist League roughed up worshippers , or lit cigarettes from the candles , or made sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vanua , I do n't see God . Do you sec God ? " The following morning , I went with Henry . Shapiro , the veteran U.P.I. correspondent , and his Russian wife , Ludmilla , to the Novo Devicln cemetery , which is reserved for important personages who are not quite grand enough to he huritd in the Kremlin . The Russian style is for graves to represent the dead in their prime . Above the grave of a famous surgeon  --  Alexander Bakulev , 1891-196 7 ? there were golden hands , five time larger than life , cradling a pink stone cut in the shape of a heart . Marshal Pavel Ryheilko , a commander of armored forces in the Second World ? Var , had a miniature tank painted battle green and fitted with a black cannon . Chekhov 's tomb , in the corner reserved for theatrical personalities , actually had a small cherry orchard by it . The Easter tradition is that graves are to be decked with flowers , and eggs are laid out as food for the soul . As f walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garlands . A regular forest of wreaths and bouquets had been laid on for Artem Mikoyan , the main designer of the MIG fighter plane and brother of the retired political leader . Hydrangeas and jars of fresh roses graced the statue of Vladimir Mayakovsky , the poet laureate of the Revolution . Someone had remembered Stalin 's second wife , the mother of Svctlana Alliluyeva , with a spray of pussy willow . Leaving the cemetery , we paused before a relatively new grave , that of the wife of Russia 's Premier . The headstone was simpleKlavdiy Kosygin , 1908-1967 . There was no Party insignia on her tombstone , as there was on many others , so possibly she had not even been a member of the Communist Party . Flowers were neatly arranged around the grave , some of them with plastic coverings against the elements . There were also two eggs .
