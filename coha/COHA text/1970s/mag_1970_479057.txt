The Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn has dense Irish neighborhoods ? even blocks of identical two-family houses and corner saloons . On a steaming night last August , a group of boys were playing softball on 60th Street when a motorcade cut around the corner . " Why you got ta pick dis street to come down ? " one yelled . On the back seat of the middle car , Bernadette Devlin , twenty-two . representative of Northern Ireland in the British House of Commons , was stretched face down . Since her arrival in New York five days earlier , she had not had more than three hours sleep a night . She had put herself into the hands of a disorganized band of young volunteers and professional agitators , who drew up grueling schedules for her which she fulfilled , at the beginning at least , without questioning . She found herself resting her head on tabletops in restaurants and trying to sleep in the car . On this Tuesday in Bay Ridge , in the auditorium of Our Lady of Perpetual Help High School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the shellacked wooden floor . A girls ' fife-and-drum corps marched down the aisle ; then Bernadette walked in , sandwiched between police officers . The crowd pressed in on the tiny girl , grabbing at her hair , pulling her dress , screaming and whistling . She made her way to the stage , and stood in front of forest-green curtains under a painting of the Madonna , with the Irish flag on her right , the American on her left . " I 've come here to put the record straight . on the struggle we are facing at home , " she said . - The Unionist Government has kept us in poverty for fifty years . They thought they would kick us in the teeth again , but instead we put up barricades and kicked hell out of them . The people have got off their knees and are no longer prepared to accept the choice of starve or leave . We will stay and fight ! " The crowd rose and cheered . People who were wearing " Dump Lindsay " buttons and who , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to one another , " She 's playing the same part as Joan of Arc . " Pete Sweeney , a building foreman , said , " I think she 's not half as much a revolutionary as she should be . The only way unification will come in Ireland is by force . " He said the Irish problem had nothing to do with civil rights in America . " Everybody 's got freedom in this country . You 've got equal rights for anybody who wants to use their rights . A lot of ' em are to damned lazy to use them . " It was like this everywhere Bernadette went it New York ? at rallies in Gaelic Park , at pubs , Trial dance halls and taverns , where she appealed t , ethnic pride and asked for one million dollars fo relief at home . It was her first visit to the Unite ( States , and Bernadette was feeling out her charism ; and her oratorical powers . She spoke of the blael cause here and movements for liberation through out the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , that she might influence not only Irish politics but the direction and alignments of American politics . As she traveled across the coun try , she was to find the prospect more complex and difficult than it had first appeared . She was to become deeply suspicious of being used and misled by her infighting supporters . She would uncover layers of ironies beneath the initial irony which confronted her in New York : a militant , socialist revolutionary relating to the conservative , Irish-American working classes . The tour was chaotic , fly-by-night , patched together by groups who appeared when Bernadette landed unexpectedly at Kennedy Airport : the National Association for Irish Justice ( NAIJ ) , Irish organizations , young socialist clubs , the New Democratic Coalition of Michigan , and a handful of minor politicians . Bernadette had originally planned to come here in October for an elaborate cross-country tour with Irish singers and dancers , civil-rights speakers , and NAIJ organizers , who , in addition to collecting funds , would set up permanent Irish-American action groups . At the end of the month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish NAIJ as a mass political movement . The troubles of August dispelled these plans . Since the partitioning of Ireland in 1920 , there has been tension in the North between the one million Protestants and the half-million Catholics . On August 12 , 1969 , when the Protestant Apprentice Boys of Derry held a traditional march around the city walls , Catholics from the Bogside slums at the foot of the walled city threw stones at the marchers . Police , who are mostly Protestant , charged at the Catholic crowd , and were joined by Protestant youths . The Catholics . spurred by Bernadette Devlin and other civil-rights leaders , threw up crude barricades and fought police with bricks and Molotov cocktails . Rioting spread to other cities , including Belfast , where guns were used . After three days of fighting and eight deaths , British troops were flown in to keep peace . Eamonn McCann , the twenty-six-year-old street leader of Derry and Bernadette 's political mentor , felt police would arrest both him and Bernadette and suggested that Bernadette go to America and raise some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have cooled . On August 20 , Bernadette and her constant companion , twenty-nine-year-old Loudon Seth , drove out of the Bogside behind an ambulance with sirens wailing . They sped the eight miles to the border and charged through customs without stopping . Bernadette wore jeans and a sweater , no disguise , because , Loudon said , " The . Bogside does n't actually go in for wigs and things . " At Shannon Airport , Bernadette told the press she was going to America to raise a million dollars . While she was midway over the Atlantic , friends in New York got word she was coming . The party who met her at Kennedy Airport included : Peter Cush , twenty-two , a law student from Belfast who had come to America in July to raise funds for civil rights ; Brian Heron , twenty-nine , born in Dublin , a political organizer here for five years , who set up NAIJ last April as the official arm of the Civil Rights Association in Ireland ; Phil Tracy , twenty-seven , recruited by Heron to handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wry humor . walked on the plane and said to Bernadette , " What are you doing here ? " Brian Heron said NAIJ would plan a national tour . The organization bad moved three weeks earlier into the third-floor walkup offices of the Peace and Freedom party , which had endorsed Eldridge Cleaver for President . There were only two phones in the office , and they were not yet listed under NAIJ . Calls nevertheless found their way there from all parts of the country . Politicians , financiers , media , Irish groups , even President Nixon 's secretary called . The phones were constantly busy for four days . which made it impossible for Bernadette and Loudon , who were out at rallies and interviews , to communicate with anyone in the office . I learned the only way to know what Bernadette would he doing from one minute to the next was to stay with her . She was taken to the Limerick restaurant in Manhattan for dinner with friends , volunteers . and reporters tagging along , including Claudia Dreifus , a buxom blonde who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the same size as Bernadette , and offered to loan her clothes . As a result of this haphazard union , Bernadette appeared on national television for the next thirteen days in these casual , slightly kooky , extremely short American dresses . Friday , August 22 . The day after Bernadette arrived . all Irish-American groups in New York were invited to a meeting at the NAIJ office . The mimeo machines were grinding out leaflets , and people were making anti-British signs . A poster of Bernadette was taped on the door with the words , " Civil Rights Now ! " Photographs of the fighting in Derry were pinned up , and scrawled over them was : " This is Ireland , 1969 . A terrible beauty is born . " Just before 9:00 P.m. , Brian Heron , who has a scruffy black moustache and wiry hair , and was wearing a soiled yellow shirt , baggy trousers , and sandals , told three hundred people in the un-airconditioned room that Bernadette had come to raise a million dollars and was calling on the Irish community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Michael Flannery , chairman of the Irish Action Committee , interrupted in a gruff brogue : " I object to Bernadette blowin ' into town without telling anybody . " He asked how many in the room even knew Brian Heron . " We 're not going to be taken over by a bunch of strangers that we do not know . " The crowd began haggling . One man yelled , " We 've seen before where collections were taken and they ended up in the wrong hands . " Brian said , " It took them eight hundred years in Ireland to declare a revolutionary government , and now that they 've done it , what are we doing in New York ? We 're arguing about who has the right to help them . " An elderly man with an Irish accent said , " You ca n't be askin ' your friends who they are . If I asked Brian Heron who he was , I 'd have to be askin ' , who was James Connelly . " Almost no one in the room knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Irish Marxist writer and activist who commanded the Irish Rebellion in 1916 , was captured and shot by the British . The factions at the meeting continued to argue , even after Bernadette arrived . She is just over five feet tall , with large blue eyes , a complexion that still bears the marks of adolescence , a slight space between her front teeth , and shoulder-length brown hair . She sat for twenty minutes before saying , with a smile , " This may be a very long way from home , but to hear you arguing among yourselves is the happiest thing I 've seen since I 've arrived . Because I 've seen it among the Irish in London , Derry , and Belfast . We Irish know what we want , but there 's nobody like us for fighting about how we get it . " The tension in the room was released in laughter . Bernadette spoke in a brogue that is arresting and romantic to American ears . The words , " coming here , " become " koh-min hee-ur , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She said . " We are going to raise money to build new apartments for our people that the government will never have any control over . We will say , the more of this country you destroy , the more we 'll build up , until we beat you back into the sea where you came from . " She finished to a wild ovation . But the conflict between the older Irish groups and the young activists of NAIJ was never resolved . It recurred in every city . When Bernadette first arrived , she was asked what she wanted to emphasize ? raising money , using the media . or meeting people . She said she wanted to do all three . This decision , or indecision , led to schedules which ran from 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 the next morning , with no time allotted for meals or rest . She appeared on almost every network interview show and all the local Irish radio programs . She spent an entire afternoon in a stuffy loft talking to reporters who were fed through every ten minutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Cokes . She was overcome by the 95-degree heat ? a temperature never reached in Ireland . " Before I came here , I used to wonder why Americans chew gum and drink Cokes . Now I wonder how they ever stop it . I feel like Shirley Temple , sucking on soda with people milling about . " Bernadette 's tour was an underground campaign . They used borrowed cars , borrowed offices and apartments . She was driven around New York by Bernie Sweeney , a medical equipment salesman from New Jersey , who has an uncle who fought with the Irish Republican Army . A police inspector , Pearse Meagher I pronounced Mar ) , appeared on the second day and said he had been appointed liaison to Miss Devlin by Police Commissioner Howard Leary . He followed her in an unmarked police car , and called precincts for escorts to cut through traffic jams . We do it for everybody else , why not for our own ? " Meagher said . A warm , ruddy-faced man with sagging cheeks , Meagher became an integral part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sang " The Rising of the Moon , " and quoted English and Irish poets . He said of Bernadette , " She 's made her place in Irish history . When they get a new government , they should bring me over as an adviser on how to set up a democratically oriented police force . " Saturday , August 23 . Seventeen people from NAIJ picketed the BOAC office on Fifth Avenue , urging a boycott of British goods . Bernadette climbed on top of a car to speak through a bullhorn . Reporters asked if the money she was raising would go for guns . She thought a moment . " Look , we have certain priorities . We need money to build houses , buy food and medical supplies . If we 've got to fight , we 'll fight , but much comes before buying guns . " The question was asked repeatedly over the next few days , and Bernadette began to say the money would definitely not go for guns . She was forced , by pressure from the press and her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angered Brian Heron , who felt the money might be needed for weapons if fighting broke out again . Brian remembered a photograph of Bernadette in the Bog-side raising a brick above her head and dashing it to the ground . Her purpose , she had said , was to create smaller stones which would be easier to throw and would n't cause as much damage . Brian said , " What kind of a revolutionary is that ? If you can pick up a brick like that , you throw it . You do n't break it into smaller pieces . " That evening Bernadette was taken to Irish bars and dances around New York . At the Old Shieling Pub , where about three hundred people were listening to hillbilly music alternating with Irish songs , she said she was tired of talking so she would sing . She closed her eyes , put her hands on her hips , and Bernadette wanted all funds collected to go for relief . set her feet slightly apart . She sang in Gaelic " Roisin Dubh " ? " My Dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in code because it was illegal to sing patriotic songs . The next stop was the Jug o ' Punch , and then the Jager House , an Irish dance hall above a German restaurant , which advertises , " Top Bands : Joe Nellaney , the Sligo Aces , the Rotten Spuds . " Women in knee-length dresses and shoes with old-fashioned heels were dancing to 1950s rock tunes when Bernadette swept in . " We 're fighting it out for the last time , so for God 's sake give us money . " A collection was taken , and , as at most of the stops , it was mainly one-dollar bills amounting to about $500 . It was clear Bernadette would never raise a million if she continued in this manner ? passing the hat at gatherings of working- and middle-class people . But Bernadette was deeply ambivalent about soliciting money . She said , " I 've got a big chip on my shoulder for asking anybody for anything . I like to take what is rightly mine and leave it right there . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She would not make calls to wealthy Irish-Americans or philanthropists , but waited for them to make their interest known . Because of the difficulty of reaching Bernadette , many who wanted to help were frustrated and gave up . Beyond this ambivalence about fund raising , Bernadette never seemed clear about the purpose of her tour . She began it without preparation , and fastened on the idea of collecting money to build homes . She also wanted to communicate her view . of the crisis in Northern Ireland , and educate Irish-Americans about injustice throughout the world . She was given total access to television and radio , as no American New Leftist ever has been . Sunday , on Meet the Press , and later on the Johnny Carson show , she said the Ulster conflict was not a religious war but " the age-old worldwide class struggle . " She said the poor people were staging an insurrection against the landed Protestant gentry , who comprise 9 per cent of the population of Northern Ireland and own 92 per cent of the land . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in power for fifty years , she said , by exploiting the poor Protestants and discriminating against Catholics , thus fanning religious hatred . " Since the Protestants are marginally better off than the Catholics , who can blame them for being terrified that they will lose what little they have if the Catholics are given a decent standard of living . " She said the poor Ulster Protestants are in the same position as poor white Americans , including Irish-Americans . " These are people just above the bread line , and they are afraid they will suffer if those below them ? the blacks ? are allowed to join society . " What the poor Ulster Protestants and poor white Americans do n't see , she said , is that by uniting with those below them , they could bring about better conditions for themselves . By Monday , Bernadette learned that newspapers might misquote her but that television works . She took the train to Philadelphia , and reporters identified her as a civil-rights leader rather than as a Catholic spokesman . Philadelphia Mayor James Tate welcomed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a $.5-per-person rally at the Sheraton Hotel , Bernadette sang " We Shall Overcome , " with a black tenor , John Russell , standing beside her with his arm around her . The mouths of half the audience dropped open . Some left in anger ; others joined in , and they sang the chorus five times . Tuesday , August 26 . Arriving ten minutes late for a meeting with U. N. Secretary General U Thant , Bernadette emphasized to him that people could not vote in local elections in Northern Ireland unless they owned property , and that under the Special Powers Act , police could arrest am detain anyone indefinitely without a warrant or trial . Afterwards , she met the U. N. correspondents , who asked what channels she had used to request the meeting . She laughed . " I always believe the simplest way of doing something is the best . We simply rang Mr. Thant up ourselves and asked him . " Across the street , bagpipes were droning and a thousand people , most of them middle-aged , were picketing silently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and carried signs , BOYCOTT BRITISH GOODS . After Bernadette spoke , more than a hundred reporters closed in on her . They stuck microphones in the car windows , sat on the tail gates , and pounded on the back . Three reporters , including myself , squirmed into the front seat , and the car pulled off . Columnist Pete Hamill , who wrote about the Irish problem before it was news and who had been promised an interview , was left standing on the sidewalk , glaring . Phil Tracy was pulling his hair . " Those people , those damned people . " Bernadette said , " Calm down , everybody . " They discovered that one of the reporters who had landed in the car was a high-school student from Bay Ridge , who carried a Polaroid camera and was doing stories for his school newspaper . " That pudgy-faced kid is going to have the best story in America , " Bernadette said . " He shows up everywhere , and he always gets in the car . " She spent the afternoon talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , outlining her proposal for solving the crisis . She said the British government should temporarily take over direct rule of Northern Ireland , until a Constitutional Conference can be called of all political groups in the six counties of Northern Ireland and the twenty-six counties of the Republic of Ireland . At such a conference , she said , " Let each party produce a social , economic , and cultural policy for the whole island , and then let the Irish people vote , not for what flag they want , but for the kind of government they want . " She said she would like to see established the thirty-two-county socialist republic proposed by James Connolly , a republic of small collective farms and industry controlled by the workers , with equal rights and opportunities guaranteed . Tuesday night was the end of Bernadette 's period of innocence . She was past the point where she could sleep , and so nauseous she could n't eat . She lay flat in the car while driving to rallies in the Bronx , Brooklyn , and Queens . At each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put an arm around Loudon , the other around a police officer , and forge through mobs to get to the stage . People pulled her hair and ripped her dress . I asked if she received the same treatment in Ireland . " Yes , only there it 's worse , because behind those who want to touch you are others who really hate you and would like to kill you . " It is part of the mystique of Bernadette that she has never been hit by a rock or bottle . Peter Cush says that when she campaigned , she would walk with a bullhorn through a rain of missiles and never be touched . This increased the tendency of people to regard her as a saint . In Queens , she faced a crush of two thousand in the Tower View Ballroom , hard by the elevated subway tracks . A teen-age girl crashed through a police wedge to give her the score of a song , " Bernadette of the Barricades . " The evening ended on a peak of emotion at Poe Park in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear-jerking version of the Irish national anthem , " The Soldiers ' Song . " Wednesday , August 27 . At 8:00 A.M. , Bernadette and Loudon gave up waiting for Brian Heron and boarded their plane for Los Angeles . A dozen reportefs were expected to accompany Bernadette on the cross-country tour , but on this wet morning , I was the only one to show up . The morning flight was empty , and Bernadette slept stretched across three seats . Loudon began to read The Easter Rebellion , by Max Caulfield . Loudon is a Protestant of Scottish origin , who has lived in Belfast since he was six . He is bright , moody , and has a sarcastic wit . Both he and Peter Cush are clean-shaven and wear attractive suits and colored shirts , in contrast to Brian Heron , who wears the battered clothing of American radical students . Loudon met Bernadette two years ago when Queens University in Belfast was a sleepy degree factory . The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association was formed in 1967 , largely of middle-class Catholic adults . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on October 5 , a march was called for Derry . The march was banned , but six hundred , including Bernadette Devlin , gathered . The police ambushed them by coming down side streets and beating demonstrators in full view of television cameras . When Queens University opened three days later , half the student body ? four thousand ? marched to City Hall to protest police brutality . They sat down in a wet street for three hours , then returned to the university and called a mass meeting , which went on for four nights . Out of this grew the People 's Democracy , or PD , a nonsectarian movement for social change . Bernadette was one of ten elected to a " faceless committee " to administer PD . Loudon says she attracted attention because of her speaking ability and her guts . In February , Prime Minister Terence O'Neill , prompted by the civil unrest , dissolved the Northern Ireland Pt liament and called a snap election , hoping for vote of confidence . People 's Democracy seized t : chance to run candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil-rights platform for seats in eig districts which had not been contested for yea ; Loudon said , " Bernadette stood out in terms charisma . It became obvious to us all that she r lated to a mass audience . " The PD candidates lot expectedly . Then in April , the death of an MP r suited in a special election , and Bernadette wt persuaded , much against her will , to stand for Pa liament . She was elected on a platform calling f ( a unified , socialist Ireland , and became the youn ; est MP since 1781 , receiving two thousand mm votes than there were Catholics registered in ti district . In her victory speech , Bernadette said tit ; by going to Westminster . all she could do was " i prove , by trying , that nothing can be done in sue a parliament . In a very short space of time I wi be back to call people out of the factories . " In a very short time , Bernadette became a sy-mb ( of Catholic militancy , socialism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldwide human rights . Because of her poise and brilliance uncle pressure , one forgets that up to a year ago , she we just " ordinary Bernadette Devlin " from Cook town , County Tyrone , one of the middle children i a family of six . Her father , a carpenter , died whe she was seven , and die family lived on relief . He mother died when Bernadette was nineteen and jut starting on scholarship at Queens . " I was gettin , on with my own life . I had responsibilities to th family , and I wanted to do research in education for mentally retarded children . I was what yo ; might call a white liberal . " After the Derry demon stration , Bernadette was radicalized , influenced h : young socialists such as Mike Farrell and Eamon McCann , until she assumed a leadership role it what she calls a " revolutionary socialist movement You mist realize the desperation of our effort-we 've got to win . We 've got to get a democratic system , because if we do n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eamon ' and I will he shot while resisting arrest . The other will get ten to fifteen years in prison . " A t the Lot Angeles airport , Bernadette was met by three photographers and Ed Pearl , a nightclub owner who is active in the Independent Social . ist Club . People in citrus-colored orlon sweater ' stared curiously at Bernadette . One woman said . " What are they fightin ' for over there . anyway ? " Pearl , who had been asked by Brian Heron to handle the Los Angeles schedule , drove Bernadette to a press conference at the Los Angeles Press Club . In a pink stucco courtyard with tropical plants , Bernadette was asked , " How can two Christian people who believe in God be slitting each other 's throats ? " She was asked several variations on this , and finally snapped , " This is the third time I 've said this ? it is not a religious problem but one of poverty . " A crew-cut man asked if she bad encouraged youngsters to throw Molotov cocktails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making of Molotov cocktails and the organized throwing of them , so none would be wasted . I 'm a very efficient person . " Women reporters asked if she was married ( no ) , engaged ( no ) , what was her social life like ? " Since October 1968 . I 've been to two movies and that 's it . No one in the civil-rights movement has had a normal social life . But we do n't miss it , because we 're working hard and getting social satisfaction from the new friends we make working for the cause . " Does Bernadette consider her femininity an asset ? " I could n't answer that . You should ask the people who like or dislike me whether it 's because I 'm a woman or because of what I say . 1 do n't think about it . " Bernadette does not take pains with her appearance : she has no time to set her hair , shave her legs , or put on makeup . The only jewelry she wears is a gold necklace with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Claddagh , bearing a heart , crown , and two hands . She does not carry a purse , and is constantly asking Peter Cush , whom she calls " Muggins , " to buy her cigarettes , Kleenex , sunglasses , and gum . In her manner and reactions , though , she is soft , gentle , often coquettish : her interviews with men arc invariably more lively than those with women . The only subject on which Bernadette hedges is the Catholic Church . in Los Angeles , when questioned about the Pope and birth control , she made noncommittal statements . Asked if she was a practicing Catholic , she said , " Yes . In Northern Ireland we 're amused by that question . We say we 've practiced long enough , we are now experts . " At the end , a priest came up and told her she should stop talking about Negroes , Protestants , socialists , and James Connolly . As Bernadette was driven to Operation Bootstrap , a black project in Watts , she watched the miles of single-story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very big . and I 'd be much happier running around the rubble of the Bogside . " Cush said , " Is that smog that 's burning me eyes ? " They turned onto Central Avenue , passing the offices of the Black Panthers and the Afro-American Culture Center . The schedule for Los Angeles was even more haphazard than New York . When they reached Bootstrap , it was empty except for one woman , Eleanor Childs , the young education director , who said , " No one was pippin ' us that this chick was coming . " Eleanor , in an Afro hairdo and love beads . showed Bernadette a toy factory where they make black dolls in leopard-skin dresses called " Baby Nancy . " Bernadette kept making comparisons with Northern Ireland . " In Derry , we have segregation too . " As Bernadette watched girls stuffing dolls ' heads , Eleanor said , " Her cause is probably cool , but we have other things to do . " Bernadette said later there was something " sad " about the project . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are working so hard , and they have their factory , but I feel as if they still wo n't be allowed in the system . " In the evening , a schizophrenic crowdf Le one thousand gathered under the palm trees in MacArthur Park . Half the audience were Irish-Americans holding small green flags ; the others were young radicals hawking Movement newspapers , members of the Independent Socialist Club and the Communist party . Heron had arrived from New York and was delighted with the situation . He believes a confrontation between Right and Left is the best way to launch a dialogue and speed conversion to the Left . He introduced The Committee , an improvisatory troupe from San Francisco , who did a skit where a man is beaten up because he refuses to sing the national anthem . Half the crowd became furious . A man leaped on stage and said , " Be very careful who you give money to ; we do n't know what this association is . " A teen-age girl from Whittier said , " Those people who messed up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian way . " A bearded man turned to her and screeched , " Hypocrite . " When Bernadette arrived , both sides cheered . She said , " My impression of America is that it 's not so much a nation as a great land mass where all the people who have ever been persecuted have come looking for a better life . Therefore it seems quite strange to me that people forget there is still a system of injustice here . I stand solidly behind all the people of America who happen to be of a different color than me . " She received warm applause , but little money when the buckets were passed . Brian was ebullient . " That was great . It was a real political problem ? it put us to the wall . Did you see how we turned things around ? " Later that night , Bernadette overheard Brian talking on the phone to a friend in the New York NAIJ office . The friend complained about Bernadette 's statements that the money she was raising would only go for relief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change her position . The friend said , " Never mind , play her along . We 've gut the money and that 's all that matters . " Bernadette , weak and nervous from fatigue and lack of food , told Loudon she would freeze all funds collected from then on in bank accounts which she alone could control . She had been told upon her arrival that NAIJ was raising money for the Irish Republican Army , but it was not until this moment that she began to believe the rumors that her funds were going for machine guns and ammunition . Thursday , August 28 . At the San Francisco Airport at 9:00 A.M. , Bernadette announced , " I specifically do not want money for guns . If I were to discover that one dollar was spent on violence , I would immediately disassociate myself from the entire collection and insist that all money collected under false pretenses be returned . " She adopted this stand not only out of anger and fear at being used , but from her deep instincts toward nonviolence . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never threw one She still believed that a change of government could come without civil war . At the Del Webb hotel , Bernadette placed a call to Frank Gogarty , president of the Civil Rights Association , in Belfast , to tell him of her fears about the money being diverted for arms . Gogarty said later , " I told her we were not a building society but a fighting society to establish civil rights . " Bernadette asked him to conic to New York so they could clear up misunderstandings . She hoped to persuade him that funds should be earmarked only for relief . Bernadette enjoyed the day in San Francisco ; she and Loudon felt it was the one American city they would want to live in . Her schedule was drawn up by Congressman Philip Burton and Joseph O'Donoghue , president of the Irish-American Action Association . After a lunch with labor leaders , she was driven across the Bay Bridge to the University of California . An overflow crowd of four thousand was waiting in Martin Luther King Hall . As she walked onstage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , and cheered , " Power to the people ? " Brian Heron strode out ecstatically , punching his right fist . Bernadette had not seen the gesture before . After a moment , she held out her fist with the thumb extended , as if making a " thumbs up " sign . The emcee said , " It 's with pride and pleasure that we can show you Irishmen who are n't on a tactical squad . " Bernadette began , " We created out of an insurgency by the police in Northern Ireland a counter-insurgency they can do nothing about . Our demands are by no means revolutionary , but it has been shown in Ireland thatyou have to have a revolution to bring them about . ' The first question asked Bernadette was , " What't your astrological sign ? Fni positive it 's Aries . " Out side in the limousine , Tony McMahon , a hartendet at the Abbey Tavern , was waiting to drive Berna. dette back to San Francisco . A tanned , long-legged blonde yelled to him from the sidewalk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl raised her fist and grinned . " What does that mean , the fist like that ? ' Tony said . There was a rally in the evening on Fisherman 's Wharf with Irish dancing , singing , and speeches by fourteen politicians and clergymen . The audience stood for every priest . A young Dubliner said , " In Ireland , you do n't have to stand for the politicians , but for the religious , it 's safer . " Bernadette spoke briefly , then returned to the hotel to write , in ten minutes , her weekly column for the London Daily Mirror . Before boarding a plane to Detroit at 11:30 P.m. , she sat in a corner of the airport with three writers from the underground press , who started their interview by saying , " We really dig you . " Bernadette talked with them in an irreverent , conspiratorial tone , and as she left , said , " We would be grateful for student demonstrations on the Northern Ireland problem . " A young man said . We wanted to organize a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against . " On the plane , Loudon fell forward , shaking and nauseous . Bernadette put cold towels on his forehead , then went to sleep . Brian Heron ordered V.O. and Seven-up and began talking about his background , his grandfather , and politics . Brian has the slightly mad , comic quality of an absent-minded revolutionary . He wears beat-up shoes and pants that have shrunk so that his legs show , and is always forgetting things , missing planes , and not answering phone calls- He can concentrate on a political problem anywhere , and wrote an elaborate position paper during a ten-minute taxi ride . He wears in his lapel a small gold circle pin that indicates he speaks Gaelic , arid another pin with a green and gold image of Connolly . Brian rarely mentions that he is Connolly 's grandson . " I 'm proud of it , but I do n't want to use it to advance my own purposes . When I was younger , I rebelled against being known as his grandson . I never studied Connolly 's writings until recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm doing the same thing Connolly did ? he was an organizer in America from 1903 to 1910 for the Industrial Workers of the World . " Brian came to San Francisco five years ago , and worked for CORE , the garment workers , and the United Farm Workers during the grape strike . He set up NAIJ last April , and went to Ireland to make it the official American arm of the Civil Rights Association . He and his wife began organizing in New York 's Irish communities , and have been moving ever since with their sleeping bags and battered suitcases to homes of different friends . Brian said he is opposed to cults of personality , " raising individuals above the masses . " What about Bernadette , I asked . " Do n't you know ? I have serious reservations about Bernadette 's trip . Politically and financially , this was a bad trip , compared to what it could have been if we had had time to plan it . We could have created a whole new political scene in America . We would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups , and campuses , especially Catholic campuses . " He looked at me and smiled . " We blew America . " Friday , August 29 . The plane landed in Detroit at 5:20 a.m. - 3:20 San Francisco time . Blinking and red-eyed , Bernadette and Loudon fought through shoving reporters and popping flashbulbs . In the pale gray dress she had been wearing for three days , Bernadette looked ashen . Her voice was wobbly ; there were dark crescents under her eyes . Loudon was sent to a doctor , who gave him tranquilizers and a sleeping pill . Phil Tracy , who had been in Detroit three days , told Bernadette there was trouble brewing in Chicago . Mayor Daley had declared that all funds for Northern Ireland should go not I to Bernadette but to the Irish Red Cross . During the fighting , Bernadette had been quoted as saying the police behaved as brutally as Mayor Daley 's . Irish organizations were angry that Bernadette planned to visit the black project , Operation Breadbasket . They had been calling Phil and saying , " Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to Chicago . " In Detroit , for the first time , Bernadette had to face an antagonistic press . An editorial in the Detroit News called her a " miniskirted Danny the Red . " Out of fear of counter-demonstrations , the city provided police escorts and a limousine ? the same , plush-lined Chrysler used by President Johnson when he was in town . " Is it bullet-proof ? " Bernadette asked . The schedule was organized by the New Democratic Coalition of Michigan , which did an efficient job but managed , they said , to " step on the toes of every Irish organization in the area . " As a result , the crowds at rallies and the money collected were minimal . At a television show , Bernadette began to stammer and falter over her words . Later , she said , " I found it difficult to hear the questions . " At the hotel . Bernadette found Loudon agitated and incoherent . He had not been able to sleep , despite the pills . She said she was going to stay with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a rally in Windsor , Canada . As the limousine approached the tunnel to Canada , bagpipes could be heard , and a red-haired man in a yellow kilt came running toward the limousine . He had a square , freckled face and pointed ears ; in his hand was a black tam with a feather . and pinned to his green tie , a name tag , " Hello ! My name is Sean Ganlay . " It was obvious he was not going to he happy about the substitute . Brian started to tell him Bernadette was tired , her friend had collapsed , and ... " Are you tryin ' to tell me she 's not coming ? No sir ! Do n't give me that bloody baloney ! We want Bernadette Devlin ? we have thirteen hundred people and we 'll come down and picket her if she does n't come . " Once moving again , Bernadette delivered the finest speech of her trip to fewer than five hundred people at Ford Hall in downtown Detroit . Because it was the beginning of Labor Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragmented group of ruddy-faced Irish-Americans , blacks wearing da ? shikis , and young radicals trickled into the auditorium . A young man recited O'Casey verse , and the Irish Hovers sang three rousing numbers . It is impossible to capture the power of Bernadette 's oratory in print . Her lilting inflection , her facial expressions , which convey humor and a steely purity of purpose , are lost in type . At Ford Hall , responding to the Irish music , the verse and speeches , and stirring herself from near numbness , she walked to the podium and smiled . " It 's great to be Irish . " She looked across the audience . " It 's great to be Irish in America , Ireland . anywhere . Before I came here . I had a false impression of Americans , from those I met when I worked summers in my uncle 's bar . The American was usually a fat man with a long cigar , a great big hat , and a great big mouth . The only thing small about him was his pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great patriots on St. Patrick 's Day , but we thought they tended to forget that the shamrock , whiskey , and the old songs are not really what makes people Irish . " She said there were three Irish heroes who , in their lives , symbolized not only the Irish struggle but the worldwide struggle for freedom . The first was Wolfe Tone , an Ulster Protestant who , in the eighteenth century , , designed the green , white ,
