Vice President Spiro Agnew scanned a newspaper article critical of him , angrily tossed it aside and noted somewhat bitterly : " If I followed the advice of all my critics , I 'd still be in Baltimore . " Indeed , there are many who would like to see the Vice President back in Baltimore again-some of them among Richard Nixon 's inner circle . Since he reached the high mark of his popularity with Republican pols on the give-'em-hell fund-raising circuit a year ago , Agnew has fallen to such low esteem that there has been open talk for weeks about kicking him off the Republican ticket in 1972 . <P> As chief spokesman for the Administration 's harsh line during the 1970 elections , Agnew took the fight to the Democrats-and to errant Republican Charles Goodell of New York-with speeches crafted by White House ghostwriters and a relish reminiscent of an earlier Richard Nixon . His performance ran according to plan , but the results did not ; in the postmortem , Agnew received a good deal of the blame for the Republicans ' relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his critics in the press : the responsibility , they insist , belongs to some of the same White House types who are currently pushing for Agnew 's removal . Says one Agnew adviser : " The ones I 'm bitterest about are those birds who knew that what the Vice President was doing in 1970 was part of a battle plan . They knew he was under orders . When it flopped , they were the loudest in denouncing him . " <P> Lackluster Tour . When President Nixon relaxed trade restrictions with China following the first gambits of Ping Pong diplomacy , Agnew warned against a sudden thaw in U.S.-Chinese relationships . Nixon , engaged in delicate negotiations with Peking , did a slow burn over his Vice President 's outspokenness on the issue . Agnew was abroad when Nixon appeared on television July 15 with his China announcement . He subsequently endorsed the Peking visit , downplaying earlier differences . Relations between Nixon and Agnew , never very close , have become chillier . Says one White House aide : " I see the old man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Agnew 's recent foreign tour was lackluster at best , and his remarks condemning black leaders in the U.S. are considered a new burden for an Administration already fighting charges of hostility toward blacks . Lately he has spent more time away from Washington , frequently playing golf with celebrity and sport cronies . He continues his rounds of the Republican banquet circuit , but even in this familiar role his aides sense a growing ennui . His pride is affronted by the small ceremonial duties of the vice presidency that he calls " Hubert Humphrey make-work projects . " <P> Agnew 's doldrums plus complaints from liberal Republicans and disenchanted White House aides are hardly enough to make Nixon switch , but the electoral equation next fall could force him to . Should Nixon decide that he must run a more moderate campaign than is consonant with Agnew 's image , then he might well replace Agnew with a more suitable running mate . Or , should it seem necessary , he could name another conservative Republican , in hopes of holding voters on the right while still getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
