Going the Three Wise Men 13 better , a Houston department store this Christmas is offering the services of 16 mail-order magi for a total cost of $825,000-which tots up to a lot of gold , frankincense and myrrh . Called The Ultimate Gift of Knowledge , a newly published catalogue from the Sakowitz company includes a choice of lessons from top pros in just about every sport or hobby the loved one may want to learn - from skiing to swimming , bronc busting to piano playing . Prudently , perhaps , the company does not offer courses in poetry , philosophy , painting or other such pastures to which it might be difficult to attach a price tag-or a buyer . <P> What Sakowitz does offer the doting donor is lessons in earthier arts that are certain to make the recipient the cocktail-party one-upsman ( or woman ) of 1975 . How many of the gang , for example , will be able to boast of a day 's skiing with coaching by Jean-Claude Killy at Val d'Isere , France ( for a mere $4,325 , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an airline ticket to California , plus board and meals , plus $115,000 , the gift recipient can take ten private swimming lessons with Mark Spitz . Want to be the best dancer at the country club ? Mitzi Gaynor will dedicate a whole day of terpsichorean tutoring for $10,600 . <P> Attention athletes : to help brush up on the golf game , Doug Sanders will take six days out of his time and $7,000 out of your bank account for six lessons in Jamaica and Houston . Tennis , anyone ? The Wise Man is John Newcombe , the venue near San Antonio , the price $8,650 for a day . You dream of winning the Kentucky Derby ? For a mere $5,750 , Top Jockey Mary Bacon will help steer equestrian Mittys toward the winner 's circle . Sakowitz 's least expensive offering is the three-day bronc-buster or bull-rider clinic chaired by Larry Mahan of Mesquite , Texas , which costs $230 and includes bunk and beans . Bring your own accident insurance . <P> In more aesthetic areas , the Sakowitz catalogue vends a day 's guitar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day with Peter Duchin at the piano ( $3,750 ) , drumming with Buddy Rich ( $5,250 ) and two " Lessons in Conversation " with Truman Capote , lisped at $3,000 . There is also a one-day grounding in economics with doom-crying Economic Forecaster Eliot Janeway , whose price ( $2,875 ) would suggest emigration rather than investment . <P> The most expensive bargain is offered by Jimmy ( " the Greek " ) Snyder , the famed Las Vegas savant . Entitled " Lessons in How to Make Odds , " the Greek 's tutorial services cost $565,000 with an optional extra : purchase of all his 1975 handicaps for $875,000 . Jimmy tells TIME 'S magi that he is betting 2 to 1 that he will not sign a single sucker .
