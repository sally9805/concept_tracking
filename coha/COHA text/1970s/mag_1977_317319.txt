A New Feeling in the Land <P> To the Editors : <P> I wholeheartedly approve of your choice of Jimmy Carter for the Man of the Year Jan. 3 I was one of the many young Americans who just did n't give a damn in this past election . <P> But somehow Mr. Carter has instilled a new feeling in me-a curiosity to know what 's happening to my country , a true feeling of involvement and a feeling of trust in the one who will be heading our country . <P> Lynn Miller Colorado <P> Springs , Colo . <P> Naming Carter Man of the Year may be tantamount to calling the Titanic the boat of the year . Performance is measured on the high seas , not on how well something looks in dry dock . <P> William E. McCarron <P> Albuquerque <P> Did you ever stop to think that had it not been for President Gerald Ford , we might not have a republic ! <P> J. Chad Anderson <P> Las Vegas <P> A man who goes from Jimmy who ? to Jimmy you-know-who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congratulations for picking the peanut farmer from you-know-where . <P> Anita Gonzalez <P> Houston <P> You goofed . <P> Scott Mortenson <P> Cerritos , Calif . <P> Jimmy Carter certainly meets your criterion for the selection : dominating the news of the previous year . But I also believe he will prove to be one of the best Presidents ever elected . Under Carter 's direction the U.S. may actually become the good guys of international politics instead of just claiming that position . <P> Daniel Salomon <P> Montreal <P> Have you changed your criterion for selecting the Man of the Year ? How can you imply that this man has done the most to change the world for good or evil during 1976 ? He could n't do anything until Jan. 20 , 1977 . <P> E. James Peake <P> Ames , Iowa <P> You quoted Mr. Carter 's promise to provide " a Government as good and as competent and as compassionate as are the American people . " In these times , that is n't very promising . <P> Jim Szczepaniak <P> Munster , Ind . <P> Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitable , thank heavens , since our national soul deserves a purging and another ray of hope . However , the story ignored the significant role Rosalynn Carter has had in the life , campaign and election of her husband . This woman will show us all the real meaning of women 's liberation , for both Carters will use Jimmy 's position for the welfare of humanity . <P> Michael Oppenheimer <P> Cleveland <P> Jamie Wyeth 's cover has given us not only a compelling portrait of our new President but an evocative commentary on the American dream as well . <P> Jennifer Hamilton Calvert <P> McLean , Va . <P> <P> Enough Hang-Ups <P> As if we do n't have enough sexual hang-ups already . To me Dr. Stoller is just stirring up a hornets ' nest Jan. 3 . <P> From now on when we have a sexual encounter , we have one more thing to ponder-is it out of " hostility , mystery , risk , illusion , revenge and the reversal of a trauma or frustration ? " Who cares ? <P> Faye Cates <P> Chapel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humans are basically kind or cruel , civilized or bestial , altruistic or selfish . We are all these things . The point is. we can choose among them . <P> Janine Polk Champaign , Ill.
