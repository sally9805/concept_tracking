TIME Board of Economists generally backs the Fed 's decision <P> Belated and drastic , but unavoidable . That is the majority opinion of TIME 'S Board of Economists about the Federal Reserve Board 's severe credit-tightening moves . Only one of the ten board members flatly opposed the new policy . The rest generally thought the Fed 's actions would help bring down inflation at last , though slowly , at the price of a recession that most still believe will be less severe than the 1973-75 slump , but deeper than was thought a few months ago . Several cautioned , however , that continued turbulence in financial markets and the economy make the outcome unusually difficult to predict . Their individual views , running from the most to least enthusiastic : <P> BERYL SPRINKEL : " I 'm delighted , " says Sprinkel , executive vice president of Chicago 's Harris Bank . " The Fed 's actions greatly increase the odds of getting inflation under control in the longer run . " Sprinkel has long argued that the old policy of trying to control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board to pump more funds into the economy than it wanted to , thus aggravating inflation . " Now that they are focusing on central control of banking reserves , " he says , " and assuming they follow through , I think it assures that we are going to have more stable money growth . " Sprinkel adds that the new policy will reduce the inflationary expectations of consumers , businessmen and domestic and foreign financiers . " If you can get expectations down sooner , " says he , " the cost of the renewed recession will be less severe than if those expectations had not been dented . " <P> DAVID GROVE : " I applaud , " says Grove , a private consultant and senior economic adviser to Marine Midland Bank . " A slow and gradual approach to curbing inflation would not be very effective . I prefer a quick and dirty approach , and the Fed 's actions are very much along that line . They will give the domestic public and foreigners the sense that we really are going to come to grips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined " credit squeeze would depress business activity and push up the unemployment rate . He also thinks the stock market had good reason to flop : " Some of the doubting Thomases who believed we would have at most a mild recession now realize we are going to have a real recession that could significantly reduce profits . " Nonetheless , Grove , like Sprinkel , believes that the recession will be less severe than it would have been had inflation been allowed to rage on unchecked .
