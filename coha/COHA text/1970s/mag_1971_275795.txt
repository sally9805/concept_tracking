Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press . <P> First Amendment , U.S. Constitution <P> AFTER all of the frantic legal maneuvering , the hasty argumentation , the acceleration of suspense in the certainty that a historic ruling was imminent , the U.S. Supreme Court revealed its Pentagon papers decision in a decorous session that lasted only four minutes . The decision consisted of just three dry paragraphs , and was summed up in two words : " We agree . " By a margin of 6 to 3 , the Justices thus confirmed the judgment of several lower courts . The U.S. Government had failed to prove that it had the right to prevent the New York Times and Washington Post from publishing the secret history of the Viet Nam War because the nation 's security was at stake . Strengthening the freedom embraced in the First Amendment , the court ruled that the presses could roll . <P> With the lid off , newspapers that the Government had temporarily stifled quickly resumed their revelations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of classified documents and analysis ( see following story ) . Yet the court 's public brevity and restraint only masked intense personal differences among the Justices over the grave issues . These divisions emerged in the rare determination of all nine Justices to write their own , sometimes emotional , opinions . <P> Criminal Charges . In general , a dominant theme of the opinions was that the Government was asking the courts to do something Congress had historically refused to do : give the Government the advance power to prevent newspapers from publishing information it wants kept secret . The minority protested the haste with which the courts had been required to act and wanted to return the case for more deliberate trials in lower courts . This would give the Government a better chance to prove , as it claims , that some of the disclosures would do " great and irreparable harm " to national security . Justices from both the majority and minority factions reminded the Government that Congress had enacted laws against disclosure of secret documents that might be applied after publication . They implied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pentagon papers were sound , it should have-and still can-file criminal charges against the offending newspaper reporters and editors . <P> Frenetic Haste . The opinions within that framework varied widely ( see box ) . Three of the Justices-Hugo L. Black , William O. Douglas and Thurgood Marshall-contended that there can be no exceptions to the First Amendment 's press freedom ; no matter what the potential impact on the nation , prior restraints on news can not be imposed by Government . Another trio composed of Justices Potter Stewart , William J. Brennan Jr . and Byron R. White took a middle position , contending that the First Amendment is not absolute and a potential danger to national security may be so grave as to justify censorship . However , they agreed that this had not been demonstrated in the Times and Post cases .
