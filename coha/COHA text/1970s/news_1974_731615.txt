txt With a sweeping Democratic victory all but a foregone conclusion , . the nation 's voters go to the polls Tuesday in a midterm election with a chance to repay politicians for two years , of scandal and worsening economic problems . The main targets of revenge are likely to be Republicans , who expect to suffer serious across-theboard losses in both . houses of Congress , governorship ; and state legislatures . Aside from a handful of bitterly contested races still too close to call , the main question to be answered is how much more of the nation 's electorate has been completely turned ' off by politics and will refuse to vote at all . VOTING participation h a s been steadily declining in recent elections ? and experts are suggesting that fewer then 40 million of the 145 million vot " ing-age Americans will go to the polls . The postwar low was 42.2 per cent in 1954 . President : Ford , Ford , who ' h a s traveled nearly 25,000 miles in 26 states an effort to repair ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of former Presi= dent Nixon , made a nonpartisan appeal Monday that each eligible voter , " send a ; message ' to Washington . . and . to the world thmorrowt " bo vo , ting Or your own ' future and exercising the power vested in ? a free ' people which has carried this country . forward'for. near1y.200 ? years ; " he saki. / " You will not just be voting for Democrats and Republicans . You ' will be casting gosh ' vote of confidence t he United States of , America . " MOST:tXPERTS " agiee that , contrary/ to historlial Patterns , it would be the Republicans who would benefit , most from a large turnout . ; While-usually minorities ' ' and lower income whites are - hard to get to the polls , preelection : surveys indicate voter apathy ' or , alienation are far more widespread this year among Republicans . ? Whether stirred ' by ? Ford 's fierce campaigning or by a , twinge of last-minute loyalty , there were indications that some Republican candidates had a slightly better chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . month ago . The final Gallup Poll , released Sunday , showed ' 55 per cent of the electorate favoring Democratic candidates , while 36 per cent favored Republicans . MIDDLE-GROUND predictions suggest the Democrats could pick up between 25 and 35 seats in the House , 4 to 6 seats in the Senate , end might pick up as many as 4 governorships . But top political strategists for both parties conceded Monday that there are 15 to 20 key races in the country too close to , predict . " There are just so many elections out there that no one knows a thing about that you ca n't predict exactly , how bad our losses will be , ? said Edward Mahe , political director of the Republican National Committee , ' If they all go , ; against us , we lose 45 seats in the House , six Senate seats , and eight or nine governors . If they all go for us , we surprise a lot of people . " MAHE SUGGESTS enough of a late surge by Republicans to keep G.

Robert Keefe , political director of the Democratic National Committee , said he expects much- of the undecided vote , projected by , polls at around 8 per cent , to go back to the Republicans . In the Senate , where Democrats already enjoy a 58 to 42 margin , 34 seats are up for grabs . None of the 20 held by Democrats are considered very vulnerable . , Of the Democrats , only Mike Gravel of Alaska , Birch Bayh of Indiana , and Frank Church of Idaho have serious'dhallenges . And Democrats are heavily favored to win seats now held by retiring Democratic Senators Sam Ervin of North Carolina and Harold Hughes of Iowa . FOR THE Itepublicad'incum bents , it is another story . At least five are in serious trouble . In Colorado , Democrat Gary Hart , former campaign manager , is a heavy favorite to oust incumbent Peter Dominick . In Kentucky , Gov . Wendell Ford is favored over Sen. Marlowe Cook . North Dakota 's former governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milton R. Young and former Rep .. Ed Edmondson is the favorite over Sen. Henry Bellmon in Oklahoma . In one of those too-close-Locall ' contests , Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas is only a slight favorite to turn back Democratic challenger Rep. William J. Roy . IN FLORIDA , Republicans figure to lose the seat of retiring  --  Seri . Edward Gurney to Secretary of State Richard Stone , who has a commanding lead ' over G.O.P. millionaire Jack ' Eckerd . Rewever , Re , publican candidates are favored ' in Utah , Vermont , and New Hampshire to capture spots now held by retiring Republicans . ' The story . is much the same in ' the House where Democratic incumbents are mostly favored while many . Republicans ' face ' uphill , reejection battles .. ' Re pelican losses are feared in New. , Jersey , Michigan , , and Illinois as well as in Wisconsin , New York , and CailifOrnia , where Democratic landslides appear imminent .. AMONG THE beg - known House Republicans on t h e ropes are four members of the House Judiciary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Nixon . Three of them , Wiley Me'ne of Iowa and Charles Sandman and Joseph Maraziti of New Jersey , were " staunch Niion  --  defeadere . The fourth , Rep , . Harold Froelich cf Wisconsin , . was a tough Nixon , critic . Despite heavy rhetoric about the dangers of a veto-proof Democratic Congress , it is the potential losses of major state governorships which most seriously imperil the Republican Party , which now ' can . claim less than 25 per cent of the voters . Democrats appear ' almost certain to add New York , California ; and Connecticut to the 32 states where they already held governorships and are making serious threats to capture Colorado , Massachusetts , Michigan , Tennessee , and Arizona . .

In Oklahoma , for example , Republicans fear . a Democratic landslide by gubernatorial candidate David Boren will adversely affect the chances of Republican Bellmon for reelection to the Senate . Strategists suggest Bellmon 's hopes of winning may rest in the 2d Congressional District , which altho it might go for Boren , is likely to produce a heavy Republican vote for a congressional candidate , Ralph F.
