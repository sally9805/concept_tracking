In its six years of existence , the Environmental Protection Agency has weathered attacks by industry , Congress , the states and consumer and conservation groups . But even thick-skinned EPA officials had to wince at a report issued last week by the Senate Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and Procedure . The report charged that the EPA had failed to protect the public against poisonous pesticides used to control insects , rodents , weeds and funguses . Said Senator Edward Kennedy , the subcommittee chairman : " I find it incredible that a regulatory agency charged with safeguarding the public health and environment would be so sluggish to recognize and react to so many warnings over the past five years . EPA has failed the consumer and the farmer , as well as the pesticide industry . " <P> Poor Planning . The angry report stems from the EPA 's response-or lack of it-to a law passed by Congress in 1972 requiring the agency to re-examine and reregister 40,000 pesticides on the U.S. market by October 1976 , which later was extended by a year . Subcommittee staffers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete the job in so short a time . But they charge the agency with poor planning and management , unnecessary delays , opting for shortcuts in evaluating pesticides and making misleading statements to Congress and the public . <P> The report aims some of its severest criticism at the agency for its decision to accept uncritically the studies and test data provided by the pesticide producers themselves-and for its failure , in many cases , to consider adverse reports and warnings from experts . The EPA , for example , ignored a report in its own files showing that the pesticide 2,4-D caused " increased tumor formation " in rats ; as recently as April 1976 it approved what many experts believe to be unacceptably high tolerance levels of the chemical in food products . The agency was also blasted for dragging its feet on aldrin , dieldrin and heptachlor . An EPA review revealed as early as 1971 that there were serious deficiencies in the data that had been previously used to register the pesticides ; new tests showed that the substances apparently caused tumors to form in laboratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that aldrin and dieldrin were removed from the market and the use of heptachlor restricted . <P> Typical of the agency 's shortcomings , says the subcommittee , is the EPA 'S failure to act effectively against leptophos , an insecticide that has recently been implicated in an outbreak of nervous disorders among employees at a plant operated by the Velsicol Chemical Corp . in Bayport , Texas . The company , notes the report , failed to inform the EPA of the illnesses for five months . But the EPA ignored equally compelling evidence that the chemical was dangerous . In 1973 and 1974 , while the EPA was evaluating leptophos , it received repeated warnings from scientists that the compound was neurotoxic , or capable of causing nerve damage in test animals . One report from Egypt linked the pesticide to the deaths of some 1,200 water buffalo , and a study from an EPA laboratory showed that it could cause leg weakness and paralysis in fowl . Yet it was not until 1975 that the agency acted to ban the import into the U.S. of foods containing any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
