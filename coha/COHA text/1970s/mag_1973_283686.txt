Man of the Year ( Contd . ) <P> Sir / Although I admire tremendously every man and woman connected with uncovering the Watergate scandal . I would have to say that Senator Lowell P. Weicker stands out in the crowd . He is so truthful and unafraid of criticism . Therefore , I hereby nominate him as TIME 'S Man of the Year for 1973 . <P> <P> BLANCHE L. PARKER <P> New York City <P> Sir / Man of the Year ? President Richard M. Nixon ! The most courageous President the United States has ever had . A man whose country comes first . A man who has not been intimidated by the irresponsible news media . He is a great man , and the greatest President . <P> <P> M.C. GORDON <P> Washington , D.C. <P> Sir / I would like to nominate a man who had the decency to refuse an award that he felt he did not deserve . The award was the Nobel Peace Prize , and my nomination is Le Due Tho . <P> <P> RONALD GRAY <P> Greenville , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billy Graham . <P> <P> MARK WATSON <P> Virginia Beach , Va . <P> Sir / Alistair Cooke : he 's kept our other eye on the grandeur and glory . <P> <P> MRS .

RADANOVICH <P> Los Angeles <P> Truckers ' Blackmail ? <P> <P> Sir / The truckers ' demonstrations Dec. 17 are base blackmail . There are dozens of other professional groups and thousands of industrial workers who have had their income cut off entirely , instead of just reduced a bit , as a result of the energy crunch . Most have clenched their teeth , pulled in their belts , put on sweaters , and are working a little harder . <P> <P> HORATIO NEWHALL JR . <P> <P> South Norwalk , Conn . <P> Sir / The display of the Ohio state troopers moving on the trucks reminded me of films showing Adolf Hitler 's storm troopers . The truckers are having to fight for their very existence . <P> <P> RUTH M. GILBERT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago young people blocked a few highways to demonstrate their feelings about a war . They got gassed , gagged , beaten up and locked up-and the highways reopened . <P> Today a group of truck drivers block a few highways to demonstrate their financial woes . They win governmental concessions-and maybe the highway reopens . <P> <P> WILLIAM SHAKAL <P> Pocomoke City , Md . <P> <P> Nixon 's Taxes <P> Sir / Nixon is going to let Congress decide if he should pay additional back taxes Dec. 17 . Why not prosecute him as I would be prosecuted ? The way I see it , if Congress lets him get by with this , they might just as well go home . <P> <P> MRS . ROY S. KIRBY <P> Grantsville , W. Va . <P> Sir / Please do not let Mr. Nixon give us San Clemente ! We can not afford it . <P> <P> MAY BRADLEY <P> Castro Valley . Calif . <P> <P> Slap Flap <P> Sir / Re your article " The Great Slap Flap " Dec. 3 : I am disgusted and angered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon .
