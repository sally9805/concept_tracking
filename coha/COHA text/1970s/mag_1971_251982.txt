Mustang Roundup <P> Sir : Your article on the plight of the wild horse in America July 12 was an excellent commentary on a disgusting situation . Perhaps we could convert our abundant supply of stray dogs into dog food , thereby sparing the wild horses and alleviating a growing menace to our cities . Of course , the glamour of a dog roundup could hardly match riding the range in a flat-bed truck . <P> EDGAR P. KLEY Knoxville , Tenn . <P> Sir : The mustangs ' plight may thankfully be offset by the nation 's horse producers , who are currently maintaining a horse-population growth rate between 6% and 8% per year , making the American equine population the fastest-growing segment of animal agriculture . <P> There are also indications that economics will finish this senseless slaughter . Consumers have enhanced the horse 's value for pleasure instead of meat . The people wanting cheaper riding horses end up competing with the meat man . <P> <P> ROBERT R. BASOW <P> Ralston Purina Co . <P> St. Louis <P> Sir : Your article , humane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for saving our mustangs . <P> Horned stock-sheep and cattle-are ruminants ; seed passing through the alimentary canals of such animals becomes sterile . Reseeding by the usual means is not effective in our arid Western states . <P> The horse is the only animal that pays for its grazing by reseeding the area over which it grazes . Seed passing through the mustang 's alimentary canal will sprout more quickly than otherwise is the case . Not only that , the humus forms a mulch that protects the sprouting seed until roots are sent deep enough into the soil for the new plant to live through the hot , dry period that follows the spring season . <P> <P> ALLEN FIFIELD Fallen , Nev . <P> <P> Sir : Do n't you have a farm or ranch editor ? Your Environment article on mustangs is about as realistic as an Italian western . <P> DWAYNE S. ROGERS San Salvador , El Salvador <P> Sir : Why is it that man must always try to oppress the free , tame the wild and humble the proud ? There is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustang - its beauty . <P> TERRY DAVITT West Covina , Calif . <P> <P> Cutting the Cord <P> Sir : I am tired of being Nader-ized July 5 . Herewith I declare that the symbolic umbilical cord that Nader has forged between himself and me is now severed . I am an intelligent adult male who is capable of shopping for good products without the help of a breathing-down-the-neck Nader . I have driven for 40 years without an accident , and one of the most enjoyable cars I ever owned was a Corvair . I do n't eat foods that are full of sugar because I do n't like them . But I have started using everything Ralph Nader deplores as my own personal form of protest . <P> <P> CHARLES W. HARBAUGH <P> Lieutenant Colonel , U.S.A.
