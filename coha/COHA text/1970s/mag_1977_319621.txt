THE IMMIGRANTS by Howard Fast Houghton Mifflin ; 389 pages ; $9.95 <P> There is something basically unpatriotic about F. Scott Fitzgerald 's contention that American lives have no second acts . The tainted blessing of early success ( " the victor belongs to the spoils " ) and a guilty sense that character is fate may have accounted for his bitter judgment . But the fact remains that the world 's best-advertised nation of immigrants was built on second-even third and fourth-acts . <P> Howard Fast 's novel The Immigrants is yet another pop epic to underscore this fact .

Cunningham , eventually acquired a house in Beverly Hills , a Porsche and a yen for Zen Buddhism . <P> Unfortunately , Fast 's life contains more dramatic and moral conflict than his new novel , The Immigrants . It is the first book in a projected trilogy that will follow a number of families from 1888 into the present . Universal already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for which Fast should gross $975,000 . The paperback rights have been sold for $832,000 . <P> <P> As an entertainment package , The Immigrants could easily be read , and eventually seen , under the title Uphill , Downhill . The principal setting is San Francisco , where Daniel Lavette battles his way from crab fisherman to business tycoon . " He had come out of nothing and he had made himself a king , a veritable emperor , " writes Fast with stagy solemnity .
