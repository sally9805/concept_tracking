This %reek , an out-of-work lawyer , he returned to Denver bewildered , but not embittered , by five months in Richard Nixon 's Washington . account is pri , or a puzzled man who gave up the governorship of Colorado to Fwcome the While House energy nth , iser but was never able to get a definition of his authority or to persuade the administration to accept his proposals for a tougher energy program . He says he was never able to talk alone with the President , was given an inadequate staff of eight or nine strangers , and then found himself mysteriously faced with a reorganization proposal that left him in a superfluous job . AND ? vitiLE some in Washington say that Love was squeezed out because he failed to take a strong grip on the job . Love says that it was necause he favored oil allocation and gasoline rationing . So he resigned last 1Ionday . As he sat in his Denver home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Given the scenario , I think I ( lid a hell of a job . " Thom five months began with the telephone call  --  from Gen. Alexander M. Haig Jr. , the Mite House chief of staff , thru whom so much of Nixott 's domestic affairs activity funnets . " TIE OFFERED me the job right . flat out , " Love said . A few days later , the governor went to Washington where he talked with the President . and Haig and then accepted the appointment , " To this day , I do n't know why they offered me the job , Love said . Whe. , Love was named head of the energy policy office , the President spoke of cutting hack the nation 's petroleum . consumption 5 per cent  --  hy voluntary means . By the time the former governor left , the problem had been more clearly defined , and it was Love 's understanding , that a cut of at least 17 per cent was necessary . The unveiling a the new energy adviser came on June 28 at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick me up and take me there and the President . and I had a walk around the lawn , " he said . Then he went . hack to Denver to resign as governor . SOON AFTEit he arrived in Washington in July . he decided that the administration should meet congressional criticism by proposing mandatory allocation of heating oils and Snore other petroleum products , hut not gasoline . This was opposed by Treasury Secretary George P. Shultz , and the proposal was never presented to Nixon . el went out to the press and told them we were going to try to strengthen the voluntary program , " Love recalled . " I called in the companies and told them they had to help Make it work . " That was in early August . At that time , Love believed the petroleum shortage was about 4 per cent and that " with a little luck we could get thru the winter . " Thru September he continued to try to placate the Congress , whose mail from constituents was filled with complaints about mismanagement gf fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FIXED up a per'Sailal letter to the President to gay how serious I thought it was and that we needed some action , " he said . The letter went tip thru the apparatus and was not answered . He continued to press for a meeting with Nixon to describe the problem . " I just wanted to go in and talk to him about it , and instead of letting me talk to him . they set up a sort of special cabinet meeting on the shortage , " he said . The former governor took heart from this . " I accepted the limitations and thought it was important to get the job moving . " As Love addressed the cabinet , the President listened . IN THE INTERVAL Love had learned some of the dimensions of the problem : The nation used 17 million barrels of oil a day and produced nine million barrels . Refinery capacity is insufficient within the United States to meet demands and the dependency has grown on overseas refining capacity . Every solution requires two or three years of lead time . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 the Middle East war broke out . On Oct. 20 all Saudi Arabian oil to the U. S. was shut off . Love assessed the impact of all that and told the White House staff that something had to he done . If Nixon was not willing to tell the nation the gravity of the problem , Love said , he himself was anxious to convene a news conference and make the point that he felt should be made . Love went to Key Biscayne and flew back in the President 's plane . Again , he said , he had a brief nonproductive talk with Nixon , who on Nov. 7 spoke on television of the gravity of the energy crisis . TnEN , lovv said , be had concluded that a much larger force than his small staff had to be pulled together to coordinate research and the finding of a solution . At about this time , he said , he had inklings that there were forces out to sink him . Earlier , he had had cumpl a in t s that his deputy , Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he had taken this to be the result of interagency bickering . Then there were hints of criticism . Ile went to Haig and odd him : " Jf there 's an ' dissatisfaction with me in the administration . all you need to do is nod your head and I 'm long gone . f do n't need to stay in this job . " Love said Haig had said . " No. that is n't true . " Love was satisfied . He had approached a man in the Office of Management and Budget to move over to the energy crisis office when time for expansion came . He expected that an 110-man governmental group that had been organized would come into the office also . " SUDDENLY , it was n't happening and he the budget official ! was n't available when I called him , and while there was nothing I could put my finger on I suppose that indicated the change was in the works , " Love said . The next indication came on Friday , Nov. 30 . At the senior White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon 's domestic adviser , told Love : " Come up to my office and let 's have a cup of coffee . " The former governor recalled the meeting as going like this : " He said . ' Let 's get Haig tip here . ' Flaig came up and Laird gave me a couple of papers with a propsed organization chart that showed the new emergency administration with E.I Simon at the top . and it showed me in a box over sere with some energy policy iuISLI . MON , then deputy secretary of the Treasury . in effect was to he the man who cull run the operation that Love ' lad been trying to build . Love remembered : " I told them . ' Well ; fine . but that means my job is superfluous mid I wo n't stay here . ' " He said Laird argued that be should stay and plan the staff , but that Lave told them : " That 's none of my business . You ought to take it up with Simon . " Last Sunday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a headline saying . " Love fired , " and there were also articles in the Washington papers that lie was being forced out . Ile called in his staff on Monday . told them was quitting , and delivered iris resignation to Haig . WHEN LOVE returned to his office in the Executive Office Building , Haig called and asked him to conic back to the White House to talk to Nixon . There was the offer of an ambassadorship  --  to Canada , other sources said  --  but Love turned it down .
