THE breakdown of the Paris peace talks in December , after such high expectation that peace was finally " at hand , " not only embittered much of the U.S. and the world but caused many to regard last week 's resumption of the negotiations with as much skepticism as hope . The bitter interim also proved sobering for both sides-for the North Vietnamese because of the fierce U.S. bombing that nearly razed Hanoi , for the U.S. because of worldwide condemnation of the bombing as well as heavy losses of planes and crews . Yet the bitterness did not prevent the two parties from starting hard bargaining almost as soon as the talks resumed . By week 's end there once more were hopeful signs that the talks had progressed to a point from which-with good will , a modicum of flexibility and a determined firmness with their allies-the Americans and the North Vietnamese might finally be able to reach a settlement . <P> The clearest sign of progress was Presidential Adviser Henry Kissinger 's decision to recess his talks with North Viet Nam 's Le Duc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his Key Biscayne home . Though Kissinger was not due to arrive until after midnight , Nixon 's aides let it be known that the President would wait up to hear what Kissinger had to report . Before he left Paris , Kissinger described the week 's sessions with the North Vietnamese as " very extensive and useful negotiations . " At Orly Airport , he declared that it was now up to the President to " decide what next step should be taken to speed a peace of justice and conciliation . " <P> Kissinger obviously feels that he has done all he possibly can on his own to bring about a settlement-and that the President must now carry the ball . Administration officials insisted that no draft agreement had yet been initialed in Paris , and few observers believed that Kissinger 's briefcase contained anything as final as a completed cease-fire agreement . There were clearly problems left to be solved and these may well require a final round of bargaining in Paris ; but just as clearly , Kissinger had some important new proposals for the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back-and the betting in Washington was that he would-the next step is to persuade the Saigon regime of President Nguyen Van Thieu to go along . In view of Thieu 's intransigence to date , that may take considerable presidential muscle . After meeting later on Sunday with both Kissinger and General Alexander M. Haig Jr. , Kissinger 's former aide , Nixon dispatched Haig to Saigon to put the strong arm on Thieu . <P> Outward Courtesy . The week 's resumed negotiations had begun bleakly enough , with none of the smiles and handshakes that had characterized the autumn meetings . No one greeted Kissinger when he arrived at the Communist villa in exurban Gif-sur-Yvette on the first morning , and he had to open the door himself . Next day at St.-Nom-La-Brteche , the Americans received the North Vietnamese with similar coolness . By midweek , however , a measure of outward courtesy had returned . On Saturday morning , for the first time in the talks , Kissinger sent for an American-embassy photographer to take pictures at a closed session-a move that was interpreted as a hopeful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
