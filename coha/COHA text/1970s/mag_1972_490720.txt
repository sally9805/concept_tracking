THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment WhappE found ourself , not too un- ily , happily , in bed with the flu on New Year 's Eve , and , in the devil-may-care mood of the semi-helpless and against the gentle downward tug of pills , we kept ourself awake and watched Guy Lombardo . The years , perhaps because he has ushered so many of them in , have been kind to him . To this trumpery sacrament he still brings a priestly confidence ; the bobbing bald or paper-behatted heads in the Waldorf-Astoria , the jelly-bean mob in Times Square , the nervous floodlights , the tensely celebrating faces still sway to his wand ; the sweetest music this side of Heaven still pours with a certain snap from the syrup pitcher ; the illusion is still maintained that the passage of time is a measurable and pleasurable process . The holy moment came : Lombardo counted backward " Nine , eight , seven , six , five ... , " the glowing ball atop the Allied Chemical Building fell , the faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns and spirals , " Auld Lang Syne . " Then , incredibly , the whole half-minute was repeated in instant replay . " Seven , six , five , four ... " and the same horns silently blew and the same spirals wildly flickered , and we seemed to be being asked to inspect some nuance in the event . Had it been a quarterback sneak ? A double reverse Had something replayable indeed occurred ? If not , was the second time less real than the first ? Were we insane ? Or was the replayer ? Pondering such bottomless questions , we curled up in our small fever and fell numbly into 1972 . SCHOOLCHILDREN are often told the story of how President Lincoln scribbled the Gettysburg Address on the back of an envelope as he rode to Gettysburg on a train . The other day , the Times ran an account of a politician of our day preparing a speech  --  Senator Muskie , preparing the announcement of his candidacy : Mr. Muskie was closeted with advisers as he tried to figure out what to tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had three drafts , one written by his chief speechwriter , Robert Shrum. a second submitted by Milton Gwertzman , a Washington lawyer and sometime supporter of Senator Edward M. Kennedy , and a third by John Bartlow Martin , who was a friend of President Kennedy . Senator Muskie was trying to piece together a declaration from all three drafts , adding his own thoughts .... It used to be that speechmaking was subject to a mysterious chemistry all its own . At best , if the right man spoke to the right audience at the right time and in the right place , he could do what Lincoln did at Gettysburg . At worst , the wrong man at the wrong time and in the wrong place could turn an audience , or a whole nation , into a mob , as Hitler did . But whatever this odd , invaluable , dangerous chemistry was , it has evaporated today . Political speeches are neither elevating nor demagogic ; they arc dead . Even when politicians take sharply opposing stands on issues , the quality of language and thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the counter-charges seem part of a single , colorless flow issuing from a common source . The mechanization of speechmaking has come close to destroying the point of making speeches . Taping and recording and the endless repetition of speeches have certainly destroyed any sense of occasion . Television , radio , and amplifiers may make the speaker available to a wider audience , but they also intervene between the speaker and his audience . And the speech-writers intervene between the speaker and his own thoughts . Too many people have got into the act . It seems most unlikely that we 're going to find the right man at the right time in the right place between now and November 7th ; it will he more a matter of nobody talking to no one about nothing . The Real Unicorn NT ' kRWHALS arc Arctic sea mam-mals , the largest of which grow to be twenty feet long .

If you have not seen a narwhal tusk recently , we suggest that you his right over to the Cordier &; Ekstrom Gallery , at 980 Madison Avenue , where the second-longest one in captivity is now on view . The occasion for displaying this magnificent object is the gallery 's annual " theme " show , which happens this year to be en the subject of imaginary beasts . " I wanted a unicorn horn , " Arne Ekstrom , the gallery 's owner and director , told us when we went to the opening , " but , after all , I could n't go out and steal a tapestry from the Cluny Museum or The Cloisters , and so it occurred to me to use the real thing . It came from an art dealer in Paris , it is eight and a half feet long , and I am informed that the only longer one is in a museum in Oslo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slender , tapering man who comes originally from Sweden , has had a theme show at his gallery every year since 1966 , and each one has attracted favorable attention ; one critic , in fact , remarked that last winter 's version , entitled " She " and devoted to the varying concepts of the feminine mystique from 50110 B.C. to the present , was the most brilliant exhibition of the season . Among the imaginary beasts on view this time , we noted , were an Etruscan stone sphinx of the sixth century B.C. ; an Indian lion , also stone , dated " IVth-VIIth Century A.D. ; " an extremely disconcerting African fetish from Mali , made ( Mr. Ekstrom declared ) " of blood and mud ; " a Dubuffet cow ( " The best of all Dubuffet cows , a monumental cow , " Ekstrom said ) ; Noguchi 's " Strange Bird , " in green slate ; and one of Nancy Grossman 's sculptures of a human head encased in leather  --  in this case , being engorged by a feral leather beak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their placement and lighting , piqued our curiosity as well as our somewhat nervous admiration , and when Mr. Ekstrom could manage a moment away from his well-wishers we asked him how a dealer in contemporary art goes about acquiring such things . " I simply start out with the idea that I 'm going to be lucky , " he told us . " This year , you see , I decided to have a bestiary , and then , to make it a little . more difficult or myself , I thought I would make it imaginary animals , with the man-into-beast , beast-into-man metamorphosis as a kind of secondary theme . Last August , I went to Europe and began visiting galleries in London , Paris , Zurich , and other cities . I was sure the right things would turn up , and they did . Several people suggested that I get Borges to write the catalogue essay , because of his ' Book of Imaginary Beings . ' I thought that seemed a little too obvious , so I asked my friend Octavio Paz instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am very proud to be publishing his text . " Had Mr. Ekstrom decided yet on next year 's theme ? He had . " I 'm going to have a sort of echo show , " he informed us . " An object of , say , the eleventh century next to a Brancusi that somehow refiecis it ; a twelfth-century Peruvian grave figure alongside a Dubuffet . The unconscious echoes across continents and centuries . My theme shows are really very-modest undertakings , you must understand . There is no great scholarship involved , and no great expenditure of funds . Incidentally- , an amusing thing happened in connection with my 1969 show , which was called Blocked Metaphors . ' In preparation for that one , I got a lot of wooden hat forms from Alfonso Ossorio , who has hundreds of them , in all shapes and sizes , and I gave them to a number of artists , who agreed to turn them into sculptures according to their own ideas . Some of the artists put very high prices on the results Andy Warhol had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I telephoned him to ask . He thought about it for a second , and said ' Two cents . ' I told him that this presented insurmountable difficulties , because we would have to give his dealer , Leo Castelli , his commission , and I did n't know how to split two cents three ways . So Andy said he would make it three cents . I bought his sculpture myself , and sent Casteli a check for one cent , and later I learned that a collector had asked to buy the cancelled check . " Lost X L our life , we 've been reading the ads in the lost-and-found column of the Tinws with the frustrat-ing realization that half the story of each lost object  --  and almost certainly the more interesting half  --  would re-main unknown to us . Determined to discover , for once , whether the things that get lost get found , and where , how , and by whom , we picked a day at random recently  --  it was a Mon-day  --  and phoned all the people who had placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items were being sought that day : an attach ( : : case , two pieces of jewelry , and four dogs . Our first call was to the erstwhile owner of a " gray Samsonite attache case , L.I.R.R. ticket office , Thursday at 6 P.M. Reward , " who proved to be a lawyer . His attache case had not turned up . " I put it down on the floor next to me while I was buy ing a ticket to go home to Long Island , " he told us . " I missed it five minutes later on the train . The train had n't pulled out of the station , so I got right off , went back to the ticket window , could n't find it , and then went to the station 's lost-and-found department . Nothing doing . The attachi- case contained about ten hours ' worth of paperwork I 'd done and a forty-dollar beep-signal device that was part of m ) office answering service . The attache case was an old one , probably worth about thirty dollars . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'd like to get the papers back . Until now , no one has phoned me as a result of the ad . " The husband of the former owner of a " Lady 's 18k gold Vacheron Constantine watch Loier between 5 Ave &; 65 St &; Madison Ave &; 62 St Thurs approx 12:3P P.M. REWARD " said that the watch had n't been recovered and that he had had only one call in response to his ad  --  from a /kr ( employee , who suggested that 11 ( run a similar ad in the Post . " My wife 's watch was very attractive , " the placer of the ad , a stockbroker , told us . " It had a tiny face , half the size of a pinky , set into a gold hand , kept good time , and was appraised for a thousand dollars . As we were waiting to cross Fifth Avenue and Sixth-fifth , my wife looked at the watch to check the time , and when we got to Madison and Sixty-second , she realized it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps . Unless one is consciously looking down , one has no idea just how littered the streets are ; we were constantly turning over old newspapers , envelopes , and gum wrappers . Our search was in vain . I put the ad in the Times because a relative of mine had once found a diamond pin outside a restaurant and had returned the pin after its owner advertised for it in the Ti , , , , -s , but I did n't really expect to get the watch /xick . It would have seemed too good to he true . I have insurance , so I never have to worn about these things ; when I buy insurance , I 'm buying peace of mind . The insurance company will reimburse us for the watch 's appraised value . I 'm going to buy the same watch again for my wife , on/Y . I 'm going to have a safety catch put on the new one .

She had been even less fortunate . Not only had her jewelry not been returned but it had not been insured ( " The insurance was too expensive for me " ) , and it had had great sentimental value in addition to a monetai y value of about a thousand dollars . " When my mother died , in 1966 , she left me her diamond ring , " this woman said . " I had my mother 's solitaire , which was almost a carat , taken out of its old setting and reset in a spray of smaller diamonds . The whole center of the ring  --  the solitaire and the spray  --  must have loosened and fallen out .

I went straight home , pra3ing that the spray had fallen out in my apartment . Then I retraced some of my steps and phoned the doctor . Some time ago , I found a wallet , and I was honest enough to call the person it belonged to and return it . I hoped someone honest would find lily diamond spray , and I put an ad in the Times , so the finder would know whose it was . I still keep hoping the diamond will show up in the ' apartment ; whenever I get home , I look in another corner . I tO not to think about the diamond , and I 've put the setting wax in the ' hack of a drawer , but I ca n't get it out of em mind .

On the previous Saturday , at 1 a.m. , the bloodhound 's owner , an Iranian Ph.D . student at Columbia , who works part-time for the Iranian Mission to the United Nations , was out walking in Riverside Park at Eighty-fourth Street with his girl friend and with his bloodhound , Russ ( " It 's short for Russet . IL ' came with that name " ) , and a beagle he also owns . Roth dogs Were off the leash , frisking . " Being a bloodhound , Russ tends to wander , " the student told us . " Suddenly , he spotted a car going uptown on the %Vest Side Highway and took off after it at full speed . Leaving the beagle with my girl friend , I chased Russ for ten blocks , after which my legs gave out . Then I called the police  --  and what an ordeal it is in New York to find a phone booth that works and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hunted for him under the highway , along the river , and in the park until 4 A.M. During the following week , I called the A.S.P.C.A. and Bide-AWee and kept in touch with the police and also with the Sanitation Department  --  if Russ had been killed on the highway , they would have been the ones to find his body and to have a record of it . I put notices up in my neighborhood  --  some of which were torn down , apparently by people who do n't care for dogs  --  and placed ads in the Times and the Columbia Spectator . A sympathetic lady saw my ad and phoned me with some helpful suggestions . She advised me to dial Area Code 201 and then LOST PET ; I did , and reached an outfit that coiirdinates searches fm lost animals . I 'd heard that there were some wild-dog packs in the city , so I took a day off from my job , rented a bicycle , and pedalled around Central Park and Morningside Heights . I could n't get very close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I looked at them through my binoculars , and I could set that Russ was n't with them . By now , I 've just about given up on finding him . I bought Russ for two hundred dollars six months ago , when he was a beautiful but wild one-year-old with an impressive pedigree . I went through obedience training with him , and he improved . Still , he was very high-strung , and I had been thinking of giving him away to someone who lived in the country , but I wanted to choose a good home for him , nut lose him this way . I wish I could he sure Ice 's O.K. The uncertainty of it all is what 's painful . If I 'd lost Russ in England , where I was brought up , I think I would have found him . The English police have more time to help you , and people care much more about animals there . I 'll admit that if you lost a dog in Iran , you probably would n't see him again . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poor Iranians are n't sympathetic when upper-class Iranians lose a dog that has been fed chicken while they are hungry themselves . " When we reached the person who had advertised the loss of " ONE Apricot Poodle small miniature . Vicinity of Irving Place . REWARD , " we finally had a story with a happy ending . En route to the happy ending , however , the poo dle 's owner , a woman who lives on Grarnerc ) Park and teaches school in Leonia , New Jersey , had had an unpleasant encounter with its finder , whom she suspects of being a dog-flapper . On Friday evening , the teacher , her date , and the poodle , a fouryear-old female named Lady , went to Pete 's Tavern . The loop of Lady 's leash was secured to the bottom rung of her mistress 's chair , but somehow Lady got away ; her absence was discovered at Pete 's in the early morning of the next day . The schoolteacher searched the restaurant and the surrounding area until 5 A.M. --  " calling Lady ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? and then reported Lady 's disappearance to the police . Later that Saturday , she called the Times to place an ad in Monday 's paper , and , feeling lonesome for her pet , which she had acquired as a puppy , she went to Gimbels and bought a **31;4060;TOOLONG replacement  --  a Yorkshire terrier , which she named Little One . The next day , her phone rang . It was a man who claimed he was calling on behalf of a man who had found Lady , to ask what kind of reward she was wilting to pay for the dog 's safe return . ( The ad had included only a box number , so she presumed that the man had been given her phone number by someone at Pete 's Tavern , where she was a regular customer . ) She said she would pay twenty-five dollars . The man said he 'd talk to his friend and call hack . He did , and said that twenty-five dollars was n't sufficient  --  that the man wanted a hundred , and if he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think all I had the presence of mind to reply at that point was I want my dog hack , ' " the schoolteacher told us .

He was in his late thirties or early forties , about five feet ten , burly , with dark hair and a swarthy complexion . I told him that I had only sixty dollars in the house . That was the truth . I said I 'd get forty more , and asked him to return for it on Tuesday . He gave me Lady , and , of course , I knew he was n't an intermediary when he said to her , ' 011 , I was so good to you . I fed you so well . ' Lady was in fine shape . She was happy to see nie , and did n't even growl at Little One , although when Little One tried to play with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask me how I could have been foolish enough to let the man come up to my apartment when I was there all alone , or what I 'd have done if he had said he would n't hand over the dog until I paid him the forty dollars , too , and do n't ask me why I was silly enough to go out and buy a Yorkie in such haste . I guess I just assumed I 'd never see Lady again . I still ca n't believe I have her back . I also ca n't believe I was lucky enough to be able to return the Yorkie . Livestock usually is n't returnable , but Little One turned out to have a chronic kennel cough and something congenitally wrong with her rear paws , so Gimhels took her hack and gave me a refund . I was crazy about Little One , but two dogs would have been too much for me . By the way , the man had the gall to phone me on Tuesday about the additional forty dollars . By then , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were interested , because extortion was involved , so two detectives were with me . The man told me to come to Eighteenth Street and Third Avenue with the forty dollars , but when the detectives went to keep my appointment with him he was n't there .

Before the first ad ran  --  the next day , in fact  --  the policeman saw the woman again and told her that I was frantically looking for Howard . He advised her to read the lost-and-found column before she did anything with Howard , but she had already given Howard to a friend of a friend who lived in Ardsley and want- ? ? ed a pet for her children . I got in touch with Howard 's new family , and was told they were already fond of him . I wanted Howard back right away , but I had to fly to Los Angeles and did n't have the time to go out to Ardsley . Howard 's new family would gladly-have driven him into the city , but it was a Jewish holy day , and they were Orthodox Jews and could n't drive that day . They put him in a cab , and he rode home  --  for seventeen dollars and fifty cents . I never worried that would n't see him again after he escaped , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hack .

' 4Vc called the Manhattan A.S.P.C.A. animal shelter ; its staff knew nothing about a lost husky , either . We called the . Times lost-and-found department and were referred to the Times claims department , which traced the ad for us . According to the Times file , a little boy who had no home telephone had placed the ad , using the Brooklyn A.S.P.C.A. 's phone number , with the A.S.P.C.A. 's consent . The Times could not give us the boy 's name . We called the Brooklyn A.S.P.C.A. again and gave them the information we had acquired . They were sorry , they still knew nothing about a lost husky .

Ms. ALADY we know was browsing recently in the Mato Grosso of a West Side paperback bookstore , hunting for a particular novel by Evelyn Waugh . She could n't find it , or any other book by Evelyn Waugh , though there were three books by Alec Waugh . At last , she managed to buttonhole one of those swarthy , wraithlike young men who always seem to be paperback-bookstore clerks , and asked him why there were three titles in stock by Alec ? Vaugh and none by Evelyn Waugh . " Because the people who own this place are male-chauvinist pigs , " the clerk said .
