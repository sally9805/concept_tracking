What kind of America is waiting for Jimmy Carter ? What is the mood of the country he will govern ? To find out , TIME correspondents across the country talked to people from all levels of American society about their morale , their current concerns , their hopes and fears about the future , their expectations for the new Administration . Herewith the report from Washington Bureau Chief Hugh Sidey , followed by reports from New England , the Middle Atlantic , the South , the Midwest and the West : <P> The quadrennial celebration of the near future is upon the U.S. From hamlet and city will come the bits and pieces of the American mosaic , and as they move down Pennsylvania Avenue this Thursday , they will reflect for one afternoon the diversity and genius of the nation , its joy and its confusion . There will be floats , mummers , horse platoons - and hope . <P> But even while the nation is looking cautiously ahead , it is also reaching back , trying to get a grip on its soul . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those square-riggers in the Hudson , spectacular symbols of a graceful youth . Later there were good-natured chuckles when the regulars of George Washington 's command sloshed by boat across the now leaden and polluted waters of the Delaware River-as they had 200 years ago-to surprise the Hessians in Trenton the day after Christmas . In most hearts there was a residue of admiration for the courage that began this experiment in liberty . <P> The search through the past is much more than just the Bicentennial celebrations and their lingering afterglow . It is people looking for smaller dimensions , for more simplicity in their lives . It is folks digging for roots , trying to build bulwarks against the tide of social disintegration that has washed over so much of the country in the past two decades . George Gallup has found that a lot of Americans are going back to religion for guidance on how to live in these crowded and affluent times . The number of Americans who believe religious influence is increasing has tripled since 1970 ; 42% of all adults now go to church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we are at the beginning of a religious revival . <P> With 150 million Americans living in cities of 50,000 or more , the U.S. is still very much an urban nation . But the Census Bureau finds that the majority of the population has shifted toward the South and West for sun and casual living , and also for a private corner of the space that remains . All over the country , demographers have noted , the urge is to go small-out of central cities to suburbs , out of suburbs to smaller towns . <P> In growing numbers , the kids are trying to stay down on the farm-or get out to one . Agricultural schools have more city-born students than farm-bred ones . In the shadowed interiors of New York , Philadelphia and Baltimore , some of the brightest spots are the rehabilitated neighborhoods where people are drawing together in common interest to find again those small human graces that sustain all existence .
