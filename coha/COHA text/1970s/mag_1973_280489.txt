In elegant London clubs , members complain that the best French clarets are being shipped overseas . In Paris salons , regular customers find that their favorite couturiers are giving strange foreign customers first peek at the latest styles . At the art and antique auctions all over Europe , as many as half of the choicest items are being bought by people who never showed their faces a few years ago . As the American tourist surge is beginning to level off , Europeans are bringing out their stale stories about rich Texans for a new breed of foreigners-the Japanese . <P> Increasingly ubiquitous , they are even freer spending than the Americans were in their heyday . At Dunhill , the sedate tobacconist in London , three winsome Japanese girls wait on the busloads of their countrymen who visit every day and walk away with the costliest pipes . ( Americans usually buy the cheapest . ) At the Pathek-Philippe factory in Geneva , Japanese queue up to buy watches for as much as $5,000 apiece . <P> While the 250,000 Japanese tourists in Europe this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes major concern . They have captured 28% of Italy 's motorcycle market and 48% of its tape-recorder market . In West Germany , home of the Leica , half the cameras sold are Japanese . In the nine Common Market countries , the Japanese have cornered nearly three-quarters of the fast-growing sales of small electronic calculators . Sales of Japanese cars ( 368,000 units in Western Europe last year ) , steel , office machines and optical equipment are also rising considerably . Overall , Japanese exports to Western Europe jumped 35% last year . In only four years , the Common Market 's trade deficit with Tokyo has grown from an almost invisible $16 million to a very visible and , to Europeans , a very irritating $1.3 billion . By contrast , the U.S. 's trade deficit with Japan is likely to decline from $4.1 billion last year to some $2.1 billion this year . <P> Like the Americans , the Japanese are buying and building factories all over Europe . One reason : international pressure on the Japanese to spread around their huge foreign currency reserves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely 20 Japanese-managed manufacturers in Europe , the number could well jump to 200 by 1980 , and hundreds of thousands of Europeans may be working for Japanese managers . According to some Common Market estimates , Japanese direct investment , now $250 million , could rise to $8.3 billion by 1980 . <P> Old slogans have been reversed , and European labor-not Japanese-suddenly seems fairly cheap . Manufacturing costs in Japan rose 19% last year and are likely to go up another 30% this year . This wage inflation at home , coupled with the upward revaluation of the yen , makes manufacturing operations in Europe much more profitable than sending Japanese goods halfway round the world . A second reason for direct investment is that if the European trade deficit with Japan grows much larger , the Common Market may simply clamp on quotas or demand so-called voluntary restraints to keep Japanese goods out . Already those restrictions on Japanese products are much stricter in Europe than in the U.S. Says Michel Carr , a Brussels management consultant : " The Japanese are welcome abroad as investors , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
