One of the unhealthiest places in Washington these days is the Health section of the sprawling Department of Health , Education and Welfare . And perhaps the most emotionally disturbed place within Health is the National Institute of Mental Health . Last week , just before the departure of HEW Secretary Robert Finch ( see THE NATION ) , the institute underwent the bureaucratic equivalent of a psychotic breakdown . Its director , Dr. Stanley Yolles , 51 , was summarily fired , and announced that he was seeking early retirement from Government service . <P> The trouble in HEW began at the top . Secretary Finch had tried to steer between the necessities of the Administration 's hard-line budget trimming and the demands of his progressive subordinates , many of them Democrats . In the process , he satisfied no one-least of all himself . " He keeps everything inside himself , " says a high-placed HEW physician . " That 's why he 's sick-it 's destroying him . " <P> Below the Secretary as the nation 's chief health officer is burly , outspoken Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unseemly brawl in which the American Medical Association persuaded the President to veto Finch 's favorite for the job , Boston 's Dr. John H. Knowles ( TIME , July 4 ) . After eleven months on the job , Egeberg succeeded only last week in filling three of the five top spots ( carrying the rank of deputy assistant secretary ) with nominees who are politically acceptable to the Administration . Among the special agencies under Egeberg 's authority , the Food and Drug Administration has been racked by top-level firings and the installation of untried new men . Last month , largely on White House orders , Dr. Joseph T. English was sacked ( while Egeberg was out of the country ) from his post as administrator of health services and mental health . He will become head of New York City 's new Health and Hospitals Corporation and at the same time double his salary . <P> Drug Penalties . As in many of HEW 's other plague spots , the emotional disturbance at Mental Health involved both personality conflicts and political interference in scientific and medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yolles was accused of arbitrarily imposing his views , rather than winning acceptance for them . The byword at NIMH became : " What Yolles wants , Yolles gets . " He might have got more-and still be in office today-if he had been willing occasionally to settle for less . <P> What first brought Yolles to public attention was his forthright opposition in 1968 to congressional bills that would have increased the already stiff penalties for possession or occasional use of marijuana . His intervention in what he regarded as strictly a medical question was surprisingly effective , and Congress eased the penalties . But his victory won him few friends and set the law-and-order forces against him . <P> Yolles himself dates the beginning of his downfall from that courageous testimony , which he reiterated with equal force last September . Many insiders at NIMH disagree . They contend that his troubles stem from his insensitive techniques in dealing with both equals and political superiors at HEW . For whatever reason , Finch 's office concluded early this year that Yolles must go . The word spread quickly through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
