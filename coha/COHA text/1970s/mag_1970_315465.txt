FROM the crenellated walls of the Kremlin to the high seas , the Soviet Union last week paid tribute to its founding father , infallible oracle and uncanonized saint . His spectacular , freshly painted portraits gave Moscow a colorful veneer for the occasion . Everywhere , banners and flags snapped in the spring breezes . At nightfall , colored lights twinkled in the capital 's trees , fireworks illuminated its skies , and spotlights played on a huge portrait suspended from a blimp . Coinciding with the civilian celebrations was a dazzling worldwide show of strength by the Soviet navy and air force . After a year of almost ceaseless drumbeating , the 100th anniversary of Lenin 's birth had arrived at last , and Vladimir Ilyich was being given his due . <P> So was Leonid Ilyich . Throughout the festivities , Leonid I. Brezhnev , 63 , General Secretary of the Communist Party , moved with an air of self-assurance and complete command . He had reason to . Unless the evidence that has been accumulating for weeks is completely illusory , Brezhnev is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's enormous power as no one man has been since the forced retirement of Nikita Khrushchev nearly six years ago . <P> Officially , power remains in the hands of the " collective leadership " that succeeded Khrushchev-a collegium whose key figures all along have been Brezhnev , Premier Aleksei Kosygin , 66 , and President Nikolai Podgorny , 67 . Yet Brezhnev completely dominated the Lenin observances . He delivered four major addresses that were broadcast over prime-time television and accorded saturation press coverage . At Lenin 's wreath-bedecked mausoleum in Red Square , Brezhnev stood slightly but perceptibly apart from the rest of the eleven-man Soviet Politburo , several of whom have recently reappeared after recovery from reported illnesses . He is the only Soviet leader who has spoken authoritatively of late on the two consuming issues of Kremlin policy : the state of military preparedness and the Soviet 's stumbling economy . <P> At the high point of the Lenin gala , it was Brezhnev who commanded the brightest spotlight and biggest headlines . Before an audience including 66 foreign delegations , Brezhnev rose in the Kremlin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech . ( Kosygin followed the next day with a talk that lasted all of ten minutes . ) Pausing only to sip cherry-flavored water , Brezhnev spoke self-confidently on a wide range of subjects , taking a tough but carefully qualified attitude . Nations fighting against imperialism , he said , will always have in Russia " a reliable and true friend . " Enlightened circles in " bourgeois countries , " on the other hand , can count on " a partner prepared to promote mutually beneficial cooperation . " He admitted to grave shortcomings in the economy but vowed : " We shall work steadfastly to set our mistakes right . " <P> Combined Weight
