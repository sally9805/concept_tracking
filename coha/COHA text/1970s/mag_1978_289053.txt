Willie Nelson , man of the road , pays a call at the White House <P> The White House has never seen any thing to beat it . Where the powerful and the privileged usually dine , a buffet is laid on for members of the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing . Where Casals once played , the entertain ment is a sort of tribal rite in which the guests whoop it up to a Texas honky-tonk beat . The placid evening air is pierced by a singer 's plangent cry : <P> Whiskey River , don ' t run dry , <P> You 're all I 've got-take care of <P> me ... <P> Nor has an apparition like the singer himself been glimpsed around the White House lately-without being arrested on sight , that is . Bearded , sporting jeans and sneakers , with a bandanna tying back his shoulder-length red-brown hair and an earring dangling from his left ear , he comes on like some improbable blend of Celtic bard and Hell 's Angel , with a smile straight out of Huckleberry Finn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The stock-car crowd is there because Ole Country Boy Carter is devoted to racing tracks the way his predecessors were to putting greens or yachting water . And the singer ? Another Carter favorite : high-riding , low-living Willie Nelson , 45 , country music 's reigning " redneck rocker . " <P> White House dinners are pretty high off the hog for Willie , who not too long ago was being written off by the country music establishment as an " outlaw " -a renegade , a troublemaker who wrote interesting songs but would never fuse his raw performing talents . Then six years ago , Willie bucked the system by leaving Nashville for Austin , Texas , where he took charge of a movement that made outlaw a term of defiant pride . Along with such congenial spirits as Waylon Jennings , Billy Joe Shaver and Jerry Jeff Walker , he fashioned a spare , linear style with a heavy rock beat that reached an audience far broader than the country faithful , mainly by appealing to long-haired rock fans . <P> The Austin sound-redneck rock or progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up sales once scarcely dreamed of in the country field . In the past two years , three such albums have gone platinum , in trade parlance ( i.e. , sold 1 million copies ) : an anthology of progressive stars titled The Outlaws , the duo album Waylon &; Willie and Willie 's own Red Headed Stranger . Willie 's latest , Stardust , is currently one of the nation 's hottest-selling country LPs , even though it consists entirely of Tin Pan Alley standards . <P> Progressive he may be , but Willie remains true to the bedrock traditions of folk , blues , jazz and country . His unusually sophisticated phrasing-now lagging behind the beat , now scooting ahead of it . twisting and rolling the melody like a champion lariat twirler-owes something to Frank Sinatra , one of his favorite singers . But his high , slightly nasal baritone retains an austere lyricism that goes back to Appalachian hills and hollows and beyond . Where much of commercial country music has only a catch in its throat , Willie 's has a touch of iron in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
