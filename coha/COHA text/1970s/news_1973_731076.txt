txt It 's back to the slide rules for those economists who expected the United States economy to grow at a 2.5 to 3.5 percent clip next year . Experts now agree that the energy shortage , whose cutting edge is the continuing Arab oil boycott , may hike unemployment to above 6 percent and retard the economy to " no growth " or even recession . David Rockefeller , board chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank , says the U.S. economy will suffer zero growth if the oil shortage reaches 3 million barrels a day . Currently , the United States suffers a 2-million-barrel-a-day shortfall because of the Arab embargo , and the figure creeps upward as the - Arabs continue to cut back their overall production . Higher unemployment ? Mr. Rockefeller , speaking on the ABC " Issues and Answers " television program , said the energy crisis could cause some industries to shut down and push the nation 's unemployment from its current 4.5 percent to a rate " in excess of 6 percent . " // *Oil less ? a drain on U.S. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unappetizing and inefficient , " as an essential step to combat the deepening crisis . The National Petroleum Council , an oil-industry advisory body to the U.S. Government , predicts a 6.2 percent jobless rate at the 2-million-barrel shortfall level . Should the gap rise to 3 million barrels , the unemployment rate , says the council , might be 7.7 percent . Side effects estimated Three professors of the prestigious Wharton School ? Lawrence R. Klein , George R. Green , and F. Gerard Adams ? believe a 2-millionbarrel daily shortfall could produce a " recession in the first half of 1974  --  and the decline would be accompanied by a higher rate of inflation . " The Wharton forecast predicts a " substantial upheaval in normal industrial and business operations , " if the daily shortage reaches 3 million gallons . Before the energy shortage took hold , the U.S. consumed about 17.3 million gallons of oil daily , of which nearly 7 million gallons was imported . Of this 7 million , roughly 2 million gallons came from Arab wells , either directly to the - United States as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Canada , and the Caribbean . Already the world 's daily available pool of oil has shrunk by an estimated 6 million barrels , as 10 Arab states ? in addition to embargoing the U.S. and the Netherlands completely ? reduce their overall production by 5 percent a month . A new study by the Library of Congress predicts U.S. oil shortages may run as high as 35 percent ? or 6.1 million barrels daily ? if the winter is " exceptionally cold " and the Arab boycott continues . Even a relatively mild winter and an end to the Arab-embargo , the study notes , would be unlikely to reduce the shortage to " 20 percent or less . " More imports foreseen Earlier projections of U.S. economic growth had been predicated on a 6 percent yearly increase in energy consumption , with oil imports scheduled to rise by about 1.5 million barrels daily on a yearly basis . For the economy , in other words , to grow 2.5 to 3.5 percent in 1974 , the Unites States would have had to be importing a year from now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that daily increase of 1.5 mplion barrels was to have come from Saudi Arabia . Thus , notes John Lichtblau of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation , Inc. , " we reach the 3-million- barrel daily shortfall figure very quickly , " when the current 2-million-barrel actual gap and the loss of growth are lumped together . On the other hand , remarks Lawrence B. Kruase , senior fellow of the Brookings Institution , the U.S. economic growth rate had been declining before this energy crisis , so that demand for energy next year might have grown more slowly than originally projected .
