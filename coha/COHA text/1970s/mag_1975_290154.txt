One outgrowth of the Watergate scandal has been an intensified Government probe into contributions by American-based multinational corporations - especially oil companies-to foreign politicians . Two years ago , the Watergate special prosecutor 's office , while investigating illegal contributions to Nixon 's 1972 campaign , discovered clues indicating that some U.S. firms had also been donating to political parties in other countries . The Securities and Exchange Commission later began looking into the matter . Reason : giving corporate cash to a foreign political party does not in itself violate U.S. law , but disguising the contributions on a company 's books might contravene the SEC 'S reporting requirements . Testifying at a secret SEC hearing early this year , Gulf Oil Chairman Bob Dorsey admitted that his company had indeed given $4 million to a political party in another country , which he did not name . A Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee decided to look into the foreign policy implications of Gulfs contribution and pressed Dorsey to come clean . <P> Last week Dorsey did . The $4 million , he admitted , was paid to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorsey , the party 's financial chairman , the late S.K. Kim , demanded a $10 million contribution , but settled for $1 million in 1966 after " heated discussions . " Gulf forked over another $3 million in 1971 . Both payments , Dorsey told the committee , were made in response to " pressure which left little to the imagination as to what would occur " to Gulf 's Korean holdings if the company said no . Gulf has invested $300 million in shipbuilding , refineries and polyethylene and fertilizer plants in Korea ; the Korean government is a partner in most of these . <P> Korean politicians have not been the only beneficiaries of Gulf's-or the oil industry's-largesse . Dorsey admitted that Gulf had also donated $460,000 to former political rulers in Bolivia and had channeled another $50,000 through Beirut , as he euphemistically put it , to " defray the expenses of a public education program ... to bring about a better understanding in America of the Arab-Israel conflict . " He did not say specifically who got that money . Meanwhile , Exxon and Mobil Oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they insisted were legal , to political parties in Canada and Italy . For Gulf , there was one painful irony . Prior to Dorsey 's Senate testimony , the speculation had been that most of the company 's contributions had gone to Latin America . Last week the leftist military in Peru nationalized $2 million worth of Gulf service stations , accusing the company of " notorious , immoral conduct " - presumably meaning interference in Peruvian politics-even though there has been no evidence so far that Gulf made any contribution in Peru .
