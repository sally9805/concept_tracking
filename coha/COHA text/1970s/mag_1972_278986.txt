THE PETER PRESCRIPTION <P> by DR . LAURENCE J. PETER <P> 224 pages . Morrow . $5.95 . <P> <P> Why are so many high-ranking people incompetent ? Dr. Laurence J. Peter , a professor of education at the University of California , provided an answer of admirable simplicity . In The Peter Principle , he stated and demonstrated the thesis that competent people get promoted until they reach a job they can not do , and then they stay there , victims of " the final placement syndrome . " Or , as Dr. Peter formally phrased his principle , " in a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence . " Bravo , Dr. Peter . <P> There is a sad tradition , however , of successful humorists writing sequels . Ring Lardner took the hero of You Know Me , Al to the battlefields of France , and Stephen Potter , the creator of Gamesmanship , descended to writing gamesman 's rules as advertisements for soft drinks . True to the tradition , Dr. Peter has now written The Peter Prescription @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sub-subtitled Sixty-Six Formulas for Improving the Quality of Your Life . <P> It is a dismal performance . But in the course of elaborating his one prescription into 224 pages . Dr. Peter provides a kind of model for anyone who might be interested in making a living by writing " humor . " <P> &gt; Turn all your observations into " laws , " and try to make a joke by attaching your own name to them . Thus : " The Peter Panorama : List your most satisfying activities . " <P> &gt; Tell anecdotes featuring people with comic names . Thus : " Tim Iddly was a conformist ... He agreed with his boss , Ty Kune . " <P> &gt; Above all , fear not the platitude . Thus : " We live in a world of uncertainty where the most difficult puzzle is man himself . " But be sure to have your work illustrated with old drawings from Punch so everyone will see that the platitudes are meant to be humorous . <P> Can one finally resist the temptation to say it ? No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Peter Principle .
