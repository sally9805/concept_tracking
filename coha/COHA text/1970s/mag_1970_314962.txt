Where does the love of man end and the love of God begin ? Can an individual 's passion be divided between the two without disaster to man or affront to God ? Does God demand terrible sacrifice as atonement for an innocent appetite for earthly life ? These are questions that Ingmar Bergman has grappled with in many of his 31 bleak , brooding films . In The Act of the Heart , Canadian Producer-Writer-Director Paul Almond tries to explore the same problems , while simultaneously creating a St. Joan-like allegory of a country girl 's purity and passion . <P> Fortunately for the film , the girl is played by his wife , Genevive Bujold . Martha Hayes is a young girl from rural Quebec who becomes a companion and governess to the eleven-year-old son of a lonely , cultured Montreal widow ( Monique Leyrac ) . She divides her attentions between young Russ ( Bill Mitchell ) and singing in the choir of the nearby Anglican church . Otherwise her thoughts are confined to romantic musings about herself and her relationship with God . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monk ( Donald Sutherland ) who temporarily takes over as choir director . <P> Sutherland tries to achieve a proper balance between ethereal consecration and worldly wisdom . But the latter quality is principally conveyed by such lines as " Look , Ma , I 'm human , " and " Let 's follow the monk and see what it eats . " After the boy dies of hockey injuries , Martha and the monk consummate their tormented ardor at the foot of the church altar ; the scene comes close to unintentional parody of the old de Sadistic monk-and-choirgirl routine . <P> Actress Bujold is incontestably a beguiling martyr , alternatingly childlike and womanly . But the force of her radiance is blunted by the conventionality of her role . Realizing that their love is an affront to man and God , Martha immolates herself . This is intended to be her act of the heart . Instead , it is simply the awkward denouement of Almond 's chaotic vision . Mark Goodman                  @ @ @
