txt Here in Middle America , the voices of the people ring with ambivalence toward President Jimmy Carter . " He promised jobs for the unemployed , but none have come through , " complains Ester Jones , a jobless 42-year-old black woman . " I expected him to do something . " To Gary Bacon , a 25-year-old factory worker with long blond hair and a steady job , " Things are looking better . " He says , " Carter seemed to boast the morale of the people when he got in there . People seem to be happier ; I know I am . " Harry McClure , a 33-year-old black housing contractor wearing a peach-colored jump suit and a gold necklace , agrees that Mr. Carter has raised the nation 's hopes , but Mr. McClure Is disappointed that the President has n't done more to spur housing construction . " It 's all right to give me a ray of hope , " he says , " but I ca n't spend hope at the grocery store . " A mixed judgment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion here . The prevailing view is that Mr. Carter has uplifted the nation 's mood with his open , folksy style but has n't convincingly demonstrated that he can handle the nation 's problems . No Frills  --  but Few Achievements People here like the no-frills human being they see in the White House  --  the guy who wears sweaters and shuns limousines , " He 's the first President to get rid of all the pomp and circumstances , " Teresa Harper , a 29-year-old teacher , says approvingly . And people give Mr. Carter credit for trying to grapple with big problems , an ornery Congress , the budget , the bureaucracy and the Russians . But they do n't see much achievement yet . And their attitude of general approval threatens to go sour unless the pleasing Carter style Is accompanied soon by solid accomplishment . Those conclusions emerge from two lengthy , free-flowing panel discussions with groups of registered voters in this heartland city . Arranged for The Wall Street Journal by the Washington-based polling firm of William R. Hamilton &; Staff Inc. , the pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another panel of 13 white-collar employes , selected to provide a rough cross section of the electorate . The two groups included Democrats , Republicans and Independents ; some voted last fall for Mr. Carter , others for Gerald Ford . The impressions flowing from the panel discussions are supported by findings of a nationwide poll of 1,520 Americans interviewed by the Hamilton firm in late May . Like other published polls , the Hamilton survey gives President Carter a high job rating : 73% approve of Mr. Carter 's overall performance so far , while only 21% disapprove , with 5% uncertain . Fragility of the Bating But when people are asked about their confidence in the President 's ability to handle the economy , the energy problem and other specifics , the results are leas favorable . For example , on confidence in his MO ity to " maintain a strong economy , " Mr. Carter gets positive marks from 57% and a negative rating from 36% . In terms of intensity of feeling , just 12% feel " very confident " while 45% are only " fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures and the Dayton panelists ' comments indicate a degree of doubt about Mr. Carter that suggests his high rating may be fragile . In the opinion of pollster Bill Hamilton , " Jimmy Carter is at a cutting point " He explains : " The President has done some style things that have held him up so far . People have given him more than a hundred-day honeymoon , but now they arestarting to look for him to deliver on specific programs that will improve things in the economy and in their lives . " Dayton , a middi  --  sised industrial city , that pollsters and political analysts consider a bastion of averageness , is a good place to take America 's pulse . Like all Ohio , It was a political battleground in 1976 ; last November Mr. Carter carried the county that includes Dayton and its suburbs by a scant 50.4% of the vote over Gerald Ford  --  a margin close to the national outcome . A Brighter General Mood A sampling of Dayton voter sentiment by The Will Street Journal last fall found people here sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the general mood seems much brighter , but the specific worries over unemployment , inflation , energy problems and the like have waned only Listen to Hugh Bunn , the ruddy-faced , heavyset sales manager at a local auto dealership : " Most people say they are more calm and more confident In the economy . They are taking a waft-and-see attitude . They are hopeful that the new administration is going to solve a lot of their problems . As yet , all I can Dols increased , Inflatton and people going more into debt " Or bear the appraisal of Orren West , a 13-yearold black man who works as a highwarmabstenanoe supervisor : " I think since President Carter wu elected , the people have more hope  --  the spirit is higher . But basically I do n't se any improvement . It seems he ca n't make up his mind . He says what he 'd UM tO.do , but I do n't see that he 's putting too much effort IMO doing IL He 's talking , but he 's not doing , " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign promises , and many feel he has n't yet sorted out his priorities . home ass fresh Ojos of the vacillation that plagued Wire stunpaign , u la his decision to propose and this withdraw the 180 tax rebate . Others thits4 that he Is OM campaigning , looida ahead to 1910 . As for his policies , the predominant view holds his eco- nomic program inadequate , his energy plan unworkable or unfair , his budget-balancing goal a dream , and foreign policy too soft . Put down in so few words , those judgments come out mounding too harsh . Actually , most people are temper their criticism with a good memo of fair play . They recognise that the problems Mr. Carter faces are immense , that Congress shame the responsibility for action , and that a new President deserves more time to show what he can do . " He 's learning to crawl before he walks , " comments John Lesko , a gradeschool principal , who thinks six months is n't enough time to permit much criticism . " One Of Carter 's big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works in an auto-assembly plant , " Is that he prom : teed us so much , he 's got to sit down and sort out what ' he promised . " During last year 's campaign , she adds , " I felt like we were living In a promised land . " President Carter is " trying to do too much with too little , " says Gene Schuman , a truck driver . " He went into the White House with the idea he was going to revamp it from top to bottom  --  redecorate , you know . Well , here you 've got a little stepladder ; how are you going to reach way up there ? " he asks , pointing toward the ceiling . But , he urges , " Let 's give him another year , " before " griping " too much . Many blame Congress as much as the President for failure to act on national prob . leme . " The President has to go through the Congress , and the Congress ties his hands , " complains Alfred Cleveland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats in Congress are so used to fighting Republican Presidents , says Chuck Mater , a 45-year-old power-company technician , that " they are still sparring ( with the President ) to see who is running the show . " He adds : " Carter 's not going to be able to do it unless they all work together . " Demands for Accomplishment Still , the expetitations stirred by Mr. Carter 's campaign promises and the change from Republican , to Democratic rule in Washington.areproducing demands for solid accomplishment . Economic worries dominate the talk here , and many people think that Mr. Carter could do more to produce jobs and fight inflation . " A lot of people need jobs , " says Ester Jones , who lost her job when Dayton 's federal " model-cities " program was phased out last year . Still out of work , she is disappointed in Mr. Carter because she thought , that his promise of public-service jobs for the unemployed would help her by now . " I thought when Carter came la , it would open up in the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a masonry contractor . " But so far , nothing has been dime , " she , complains . Similarly , Mr. McClure , the builder , recalls that Mr. Carter " did promise to spur the housing industry , " and Mr. McClure thought that the Democratic President would pump more money into federal housing programs . But he finds the programs pet as tight under Mr. Carter as under Mr. Ford . DeAnn Dillon , a 20-year-old college student , thinks that Mr. Carter has " a personality that puts people at ease , " but the job picture for the young people puts her I l at ease . " I do n't see much improvement , ecocomically , " she comments . " Unemployment for students Is just horrid . " Some who work in the local factories , like the youthful Mr. Bacon and gray-haired Opal Hansen , ' flnd the job picture improving . " I work in automotive , and right now it 's very good because car sales seem to be up , " remarks Mrs. Hansen , who Is employed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in employment has left many others , like Ester Jones , still waiting . The Problem of Inflation Unlike unemployment , inflation is a worry for everybody , and the recent unfavorable price statistics are n't helping Mr. Carter . " The first three months of this year , we had double-digit inflation , " says Gerald Coil , a 67-year-old retiree . He thinks that the President should put more effort into " solving the inflation problem . " Though inflation worries are widespread , comments in the group sessions suggest that many are resigned to ever-rising prices . " Government tries to do something , but it is so minute against the odds that it is hardly worth talking about , " says Mr. Kinter , the power-company technician . Some mention the President 's promise to balance the budget within four years as an effort against inflation , but there is widespread doubt that he can do it or that it would help much if he did . " I do n't know how you can balance the budget , and still put more people to work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " remarks Mr. Schuman , the truck driver . Mr. West , the highway-maintenance man , thinks that balancing the budget Is a ' good Idea but that " there is no way " President Carter can do it " with the type of program that he 's talked about . " The big Washington politicians ' debate over whether balancing the budget should come before new government social programs draws mostly yawns In the group talks . There is little enthusiasm for either among these people , who seem more concerned with topics directly affecting their lives . Like energy . Now that stirs some passions . " As far as the energy crisis Is con ' cerned , I believe that 's a bunch of stuff , " anafis Mr. Cleveland , the young hospital worker , obviously restraining his language for mixed company . Perhaps half the membership of the blue-collar group think that the energy " crisis " is a hoax designed to push up prices . The rest , and most of the white-collar group , accept it as real , but there is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . Perception of Unfairness " I think there is an energy crisis , " Mr. West says , " but I do n't think President Carter 's energy program amounts to a hill of beans . " He adds : " A tax on gas guzzlers wo n't mean anything to the man with the money ; he will buy gas and guzzle right along But it will affect the common man , the lower-middle-class working man , because he ca n't afford to buy . " This perception of the Carter program as unfair to lower-income groups is widespread . " The problem with his program is . Who is it going to hit the hardest ? " says Betsie Gricar , a 28-year-old secretary . " The person with the big car also can afford the gas , but it 's going to be the middle-class person who is going to get hit again . " Mr. Bunn , the auto salesman , does n't like Mr. Carter 's program but gives him credit for focusing national attention on the problem . " He had to get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's like a brainstorm . You throw out ideas , and it is just to get the country really thinking . I doh't think he ever expected the proposals he put out to be adopted . " ? If there is agreement on an alternative to the Carter tax-and-conserve approach , It Is to push harder for new energy sources : more oil drilling , nuclear power , solar energy and coal development . There is worry that any big conservation push could hurt the economy , worsening inflation and unemployment . Foreign Policy Foreign policy Mrs little interest among people here , despite Mr. Carter 's stress on such issues as international human rights and arms negotiations . The most common complaint is that the President may be adopting too " soft " a policy on national defense and relations with the Soviet Union . " I do n't think we 're keeping up on our armaments and defense , " says Mrs. Hansen , the auto-plant worker , who says she " does n't trust Russia " to keep an arms agreement . Not surprisingly , retired Air Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter ) is beginning to fall Into the same trap his predecessors did as far tiJI negotiating with the Russians is concerned . They are going to take advantage of us . " Adds Mr. Schuman , the truck driver : " I think Mr. Carter should be wielding a bigger stick , and he should take . the foam rubber out of it and put some nails in it . " These Daytonlens seem to want a strong leader in both foreign and domestic matters ? one who takes firm positions and sticks to them . Some fear that they see signs of weakness . " I feel Carter is afraid to do any- ? thing to displease the American people ; he kind of wavers around , " says DeAnn Dillon , . the college student . Nancy Muter , another collegb student , believes that Mr. Carter " Is still politicking now , working on getting reelected to another term . " Mr. Cleveland , the hospital worker , says Mr. Carter " Is in a position ' now where he does have to take a stand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know where his head is . " , Perhaps the general mood is best summed up by asan Cooper , a.black college coed , who was attracted to Mr. Cagier last year because ho offered the =miry a fro* start . " I know it min be done  --  orernight " she says . ' " But how long is it going MOM* ? He has uplifted , the hops . ol the people . He has got everybody where be wants them . ' But bow long Is be going to go IMMO he ay " tually does what be orated to the Bogle that he was going to do ? "
