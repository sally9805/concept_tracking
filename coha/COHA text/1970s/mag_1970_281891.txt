If I had taken these fantasies of the unconscious as art , they would have carried no more conviction than visual perceptions , as if I were watching a movie . <P> - Carl Jung <P> There have been hundreds of Freudian films : Fellini Satyricon is probably the first-and certainly the most important-Jungian one . In the course of two hours and seven minutes , images , totems , and archetypes rise and burst like hydrogen sulfide bubbles from the marsh of the collective unconscious . The unsynchronized sound track has the timbre of racial memory , echoing some eternal dream time . The film 's devices are , in fact , so frenzied and eruptive that they tend to obscure an artlessness of thought or substance . Perhaps it is just as well ; the Fellini Satyricon is manifestly made for the eye 's mind , not the mind 's eye . " Faces are my words , " says the film maker , and he manages to make them speak an epic . <P> Cinema 's greatest living satirist ( La Dolce Vita , 8 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been half in love with his main target : decadence . His favorite gallery is Rome , where the extravagances of the Via Veneto add daily calories to the Sweet Life . The Appian Way leads into the past , into the harsh , lurid revels of Petronius , who mocked Nero 's ancient Sybarites with the first Satyricon . Although only fragments of that manuscript survive , they are enough to reveal a Homeric spoof . The hilariously ignoble hero , Encolpius ( sometimes translated as " the Crotch " ) , is a randy homosexual . His wanderings lead him not to godlike beings but to all too human Romans . <P> Vulgarian 's Feast . The true Satyricon is shot through with fragments of poetry . The Fellini Satyricon finds visual equivalents-but often at the price of coherence . Scenes are shifted , new ones are added , characters are blunted or sharpened . Still , Fellini has left the Petronian framework intact . Like almost all his social satire , Satyricon is a picaresque journey through the beds and banquet hails of Rome . Now Encolpius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max Born ) ; now impotent , he whimpers about his " blunted sword " ; now he overstuffs his gullet at a vulgarian 's feast ; now he is a starveling captive aboard a slave ship . <P> Fellini calls his Satyricon a " science-fiction trip into the past instead of the future . " It blasts off with a scene so brilliant that the whole picture shivers from the thrust . In a masque , a musically flatulent clown capers on a stage , mocking the audience with scatological jokes and gestures . A grinning idiot is carried onstage and led to a chopping block . A headsman mimes a blow with his weapon - then chops the victim 's hand off to a chorus of cackles , while freshets of blood stain the scene . It is a savage fragment of the cinema of cruelty , a death-in-life image , like T.S . Eliot 's perception of " the skull beneath the skin . "
