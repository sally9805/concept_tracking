txt John Fletcher , director of St. Paul 's Como Zoo , stumbled from his bed to answer the phone one recent predawn morning . " Mr. Fletcher ? a man 's fallen into ' Whitey 's den . " the caller cried excitedly : Mr. Fletcher dressed hurriedly and rushed ito the zoo , where he found police and firemen trying to distract Whitey  --  the zoo 's polar bear ? away from the body of a semiconscious man . When Whitey made another lunge toward the man , Mr. Fletcher ordered , " Shoot the bear ! " A police marksman killed the bear , valued at $2,500 , and saved the 24-year-old man . That the man entered zoo grounds long after it had closed for the day did not quell public reaction . The issue was daily debated in local papers and on radio and television . Drunkenness involved As a result , other zoos around the country now find themselves held up to scrutiny , which is certain to continue , particularly in light of a similar tragedy that followed closely the St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a - 19- year- old youth was found in the zoo 's polar-bear den . While agreeing that many zoos have security problems and that danger is often possible for both animals and people , Mr. Fletcher maintains that common sense ought to keep people away from potentially dangerous animals . He states , however , that most animal abuse and vandalism at zoos is caused by persons who have had too much to drink . Drunkenness was directly related to the incident at the Como Zoo . " We understand the fellow was trying to balance atop the cable wires that separate the moat from the area where visitors observe the bear , " Mr. Fletcher said . " So far as I know , there 's no zoo in the country where someone could simply fall into a pit of bears or lions . Whoever winds up there has to make an effort to get there . And in most cases with which I 'm familiar , those people have been highly intoxicated . " Taxes to finance repairs ? Though St. Paul 's zoo has never been surrounded by fences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers feel it will help somewhat , but they do n't see it as a panacea . " Someone who 's bent on mischief will manage to get in , " says a zoo employee . Mr. Fletcher proposes that some of the tax the state collects on liquor should be used to repair damages done at zoos by excessive drinkers . And nationwide , this damage is extensive . For example : ? Animals at Detroit 's Belle Isle children 's zoo have been fatally clubbed . ? A while back in Pol'tland , Ore. , lions killed a youth who had been taunting them . Someone sneaked back to the zoo next night and shot the lions . ? Back in 1969 , following a beer party , youths stoned five birds to death at Como Zoo . In the Twin Cities the latest incident pro- ... Weed widely varying opinions , nearly all of them critical . A number of letters said the man and not the bear should have been shot . Others have advocated the killing of all " vicious " animals . // *Focus : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors can be adequately protected from each other , there should probably be no zoo at all . " says a St. Paul housewife , representing a small but growing ' segment of local citizens . That some zoo facilities are perhaps too small , or offer inadequate protection , is doubtless true . But animal abuse is a fairly recent phenomenon . " Years ago , " says a retired zoo employee , " about all you really needed was a sign that said , ' Stay away from the animals , ' and folks did . Nowadays , some people  --  intoxicated usually  --  will fight their way into a den of lions . There are more and more sick people causing trouble the past five or 10 years than in the first 30 years I worked zoos . " What worries zoo directors , though , is that as instances of abuse and vandalism continue  --  sometimes involving fatal injury to people and animals  --  movements to abolish zoos entirely will gain strength . And that , claims Mr. Fletcher , would be a real tragedy .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
