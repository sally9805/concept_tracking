ESTHER Well , do what you want . I have n't said anything . BUD I ca n't whip up the end of the rod just for a nibble . I have to let him swallow the bait , because , if it 's a trout , and I jerk up the line , then the hook will pull right out of his mouth . Sea trout have the tenderest mouths in the world .

BUD Nonsense , they 're our kids . ESTHER Well , we could say we 're not well . BUD We 're not so well , but the fact is , we have n't been so marvelously well in such a long time . They 'll have to wait . ESTHER Your rod is bent double , if you do n't pull it in I 'm going to get upset . BUD I 'm playing him . I know it 's bent double . I 'm playing him , Esther .

BUD While I slept ? ESTHER No , you were watching the turkey buzzards . BUD At the Sanctuary . ESTHER No , it was at the old Bailey place . You were up in the tower . BUD Did I get any good pictures ? ESTHER They 're being developed . BUD I hope I had my telephoto lens on . ESTHER They sent this delegation . BUD What did you have for lunch ?

These sparrows darting and falling and recovering and they were so thick I could barely make out if the sky was blue or cloudy . SOUND : A car approaches . BUD It 's an Olds . ESTHER The kids have been planning to come down here for a long time . BUD I was up all night again . ESTHER No you were n't . BUD I know if I was up all night . I could n't sleep . ESTHER You just think you could n't . I heard you snoring . BUD Only a minute . Woke myself up . Could n't get back to sleep . Are they here yet ? ESTHER I heard a car .

ESTHER They seem to think you put them off their game . BUD But I do n't say a word . I smile and I watch . . . . I hardly ever speak . I nod and discuss the weather , and I tell how many fish I caught . How could I put them off their game ? I only stay an hour or two , I do n't even suggest which card to play , even when I can see how they could have taken another trick . ESTHER I do n't know how to tell you this . I told them they should take it up with you personally . BUD Well , they should . ESTHER I did n't want to be the one to have to tell you . After all , it has nothing to do with me . BUD How could I put them off their game ? I do n't even play their game . p. 12 ESTHER Here 's the letter from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . ESTHER He did . He told me to tear up the letter . He could n't seem to remember if he 'd mailed it . He said that he wrote you three letters , he thought , but he could n't remember mailing them , and anyway , he said that it would be better if he spoke , because no matter how he tried to write it , he could n't say what it was that you did that bothered the other club members . BUD Read me the letter . ESTHER Well , here it is . BUD When did he mail it ? ESTHER Let me see , the postmark is February 12 , P.M. BUD Lincoln 's Birthday ? ESTHER I think so . BUD That was yesterday . ESTHER I think so . BUD Did we observe it ? ESTHER We did n't know about it . BUD I guess we did n't know about it till today . SOUND : A car approaches . p. 13 BUD I 'd swear it 's an Oldsmobile . ESTHER I ca n't tell one car from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go by when I was younger . I know every machine that was ever made . Could draw you a picture of any one of them  --  that is , if I could draw , but I got the picture plain as day in my head .

ESTHER I 'm longing for fresh fish . BUD Hold your horses . ESTHER Reel him in . BUD It 's just a little fellow eating around the edges of the shrimp . p. 14 ESTHER Flip the tip . Get him in . BUD It wo n't do any good . ESTHER I ca n't bear the suspense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's happening . BUD I 'll bet you 're skunked . ESTHER Nothing 's there . BUD I 'll bet you 're clean out of bait . ESTHER How do you know ? BUD You have n't had a nibble in five minutes . ESTHER There he goes again . Oh , set the hook , set the hook . BUD Be patient . We 've been fishing together for forty years , and you 're getting less patient . Why , you used to sit with me all day , and never say a word except pass the salt . That 's why I married you . I did n't have to talk to you  --  you always seemed to know what I was thinking , and me , you . ESTHER You knew what I was thinking ? BUD I always knew what you were thinking . ESTHER Do you know ? p. 15 BUD What ? ESTHER Do you always know what I 'm thinking now ? BUD Only when I look at you . ESTHER I had a premonition when he came to the door . BUD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching the turkey buzzards . BUD Got some good pictures of ' em too . God they love to fly . They hover and . . . ESTHER They love to eat , that 's why they look like that in the sky . BUD But the way they hang there in the air . . . ESTHER Looking for food , that 's what makes ' em look like that . BUD But the way they glide . . . . ESTHER Watching for a cripple to gobble , that 's why they glide like that . . . . BUD I like to watch them . ESTHER They 're watching you . BUD I can feel him again . ESTHER Set the hook . BUD Too soon . p. 16 ESTHER Set the hook . BUD No , I like to feel him there . I 'm waiting . I 'm going to land you the biggest snook for this time of year you ever saw . It 's nothing to catch a snook in June . But now . Watch out . I 'm going to land a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their chairs and ask what I used for bait . ESTHER That 's what I wanted to tell you about . BUD What 's that ? ESTHER They want you to stay away for a while , Bud . They do n't want you coming around the club for a while . SOUND : Mynahs chattering and calling . BUD I was up all night again , Esther . ESTHER Not again . BUD Could n't get to sleep . ESTHER You just think you did n't sleep . BUD I know I did n't sleep . I can tell you everything I was thinking about the whole night long . ESTHER So can I. It 's the same things you 've been thinking about any night you were up . BUD I do n't feel as tired as I was afraid I 'd be . Want to catch you that snook . I know how much you like snook broiled in butter and lemon fresh from the Gulf . p. 17 ESTHER I like it , I really do like it . Better than steak to me . BUD I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ESTHER I suppose I was . BUD Never did know anyone to enjoy fish as much as you . ESTHER I could live on it . I could eat snook or snapper every day of my life and never tire of it . BUD I 'm gon na get you a fresh one today . ESTHER They have n't been running . BUD Fishing is a matter of confidence . I know I 'll catch one today . Like last week , I just did n't feel lucky . I did n't have a grasp on the pole , I did n't have confidence in the tide . And I did n't catch much of anything but some whiting and ladyfish . Today is something else . I know I 'm gon na get you one . SOUND : Surf and a light wind . A dog barks . ESTHER I 'm going to tear up the letter . BUD No . ESTHER Yes , I 'm going to tear it up . It 's too hurtful  --  unjust . BUD If that 's the way they feel about me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ESTHER No , I think I 'll tear it up . BUD I 'd just as soon face it . Give it to me . ESTHER No , it 's entirely unjust . You did n't have any control in the project and they have overlooked that fact . BUD I made some money out of it , that 's what 's sticking in their craws . ESTHER Could be . BUD I tried . I tried every way I knew to get them all a piece of it , but I was only one of five . The other four blackballed my friends . But it 's me gets the blame . ESTHER They feel they helped you find the land . BUD Well , they did . But it was me figured out the way to develop it , and get the backing to make the project come true . Every lot has been sold . Every one a waterfront property ; every one with his own dock and fishing pier . I tried to get my friends in on it , but they did n't want to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it , and they want to get even with me . I voted for them , the other four men voted no . What could I do ? Are they angry at the ones voted against them ? No , it 's me . You 're right , it is hurtful . I do n't want to think about it . Do they want to throw me out of the club ? p. 19 ESTHER They want to ban you for a while . BUD Ban me ? ESTHER Yes , they do n't want you to come around and watch the card games for six weeks . BUD Six weeks . Where 'd they get six weeks ? ESTHER The president feels that if they sentence you to six weeks of not coming around the club , it will kind of even the score , and then the rest of them will go on with you . BUD I helped build the club . I helped get it established . ESTHER Well , the new members feel crowded , he said . BUD The new members ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , no matter how much he loved it in the start , when the newest members carry the most weight . ESTHER There are a lot of them . I guess they can outvote . SOUND : Mynahs laughing . BUD I bet it is n't the new members . What would the new members want with hurting me ? They do n't know me well enough to want to hurt me . It 's the oldtimers feel I 'm out of touch with them . That 's what they want . They want to hurt me . They want to really hurt me . Did n't know I had that kind of power . SOUND : A car goes by very fast . p. 20 ESTHER I think I 'll tear it up . BUD No , you 'll do nothing of the kind . I 'm going to paste it on the bathroom mirror . I want to be reminded every day how vengeful people are with nothing but emotion to back them up . They have the facts all wrong . They 've assumed I 'm against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't control the world . I ca n't manage every event . They 've turned on me  --  I , who set them up in the first place . They learned a lot about business and land development in their association with me . They 're all better fixed now , and smarter than when we started . Had a friend in the old days , used to say there 's no justice . I take my hat off to you , Roger . Had to live a long time to say you 're right . SOUND : Huge waves begin to break on the shore . BUD Get back out of the tide , Esther . ESTHER It feels good around my ankles . BUD Get back out , I say . Look . Look there . ESTHER Fins ? BUD Sharks . ESTHER Porpoise . BUD Do n't take a chance . ESTHER That 's not a shark . p. 21 BUD There 's two of ' em . Get back , Esther , they 're feeding four feet from shore . They could dash in and snap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg . ESTHER Nonsense . That 's not a shark . BUD He came up just three feet from shoreline . They can roll on their bellies and pretend to be flounder . Last summer a little girl had her arm bitten off at the shoulder by one of them devils . ESTHER ( Laughing ) It 's a porpoise . BUD Want to bet ? ESTHER I do n't want to bet . I like the tide washing over my legs . BUD Your slacks are getting wet , too . ESTHER I do n't care . All my life I wanted to be able to stand in the water and fish and it 's warm enough here . Look at the sunset . BUD Supposed to go down at six fifty-five . It 's right on schedule . Are you going to get out of the drink or am I going to throw you over my shoulder ? ESTHER You been here long enough to tell a shark fin from a porpoise . Look how they roll and play with one another . No shark ever does like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now . I 'm going to get out the fish book and we 'll settle it . I do n't want to take no chances with you , sweetheart . ESTHER What ? BUD Sweetheart . ESTHER What . . . . BUD Sweetheart . ESTHER What . . . . BUD Sweetheart , now do like I ask , just to please me . Get out of the water . Do n't take a chance . ESTHER All right . BUD Thank you . SOUND : A car in the distance . BUD The kids must have had to drive night and day . ESTHER Jim loves to drive . BUD He never gets enough rest . ESTHER They keep him on the go . BUD He 's been a go-getter for them . ESTHER They use him up . BUD He does n't know how to ration himself out . ESTHER I ca n't wait to see him . p. 23 BUD Are they bringing the children ? ESTHER All but Susan . She 's training for the swimming team . BUD She could swim here . ESTHER She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so young to spend so many hours going around and about in a pool . ESTHER She 's like her father . BUD Why 'd they want to drive down here ? ESTHER You know Jim loves to drive . BUD He should have taken the plane and saved up on himself . ESTHER He ca n't stand to have anyone else doing the driving . BUD Should have taken the plane . I 'd have advanced him the money . I 'm going over to the club , and I 'm going to have a talk with all of them and get the whole thing out in the open . ESTHER That 's a good idea . BUD It 's the only thing to do . But if I do do that ? . . . Read me the letter . But if they are so hurt with me , maybe they should have a chance to get even . ESTHER And let them get away with hurting you ? p. 24 BUD I can stand it better than they can . Maybe if they do bar me from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then when I do go back , we can all start over with a clean slate . ESTHER They 'll just be laughing up their sleeves at you . You should go there and tell them off and quit . BUD But I helped start the club . ESTHER You can start another . BUD It 's meant a lot to me . ESTHER You give them too much . BUD Well , it has meant a lot to me , ca n't deny it . ESTHER You go over there and resign . BUD Ca n't do that . Maybe I 'll say nothing and never go back . Yes , I think that 's what I 'll do . I 'll keep quiet and I 'll never go back . Then what will they do with their anger ? Yes . I think I 'll keep quiet and never go back . Do you have the letter ? ESTHER You never get mad enough . BUD What good does it do ? ESTHER You just wo n't get mad . BUD I 'm not mad . p. 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , yes of course , I am . ESTHER And tomorrow you 'll be depressed and you wo n't talk to me for days . BUD I wo n't be depressed . ESTHER You ca n't help it . BUD I wo n't be depressed . I 'll take you to the Plantation for dinner . ESTHER It 's a pretty place , but they do n't know how to cook . BUD I 'll catch you a snook today and I 'll catch you a snapper tomorrow . You know how to cook . ESTHER Sweetheart . BUD Yes . ESTHER Sweetheart . BUD Hello . SOUND : Mynahs laughing , gulls screaming and complaining . The dog barks and a flock of gulls ascends . ESTHER I dreamed about my sister again , Bud . BUD Been years since you 've seen her . ESTHER Ca n't understand it . I do n't think about her for months , and then I get such a dream . I nearly woke you . p. 26 BUD I was awake . . . . I was awake all night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doctor . I felt terribly ill . My period was two weeks overdue . I was frightened that I was pregnant , but I knew I had n't slept with anyone . I did n't think I had , but I had fears that I had and blotted it out . I was so upset . I walked around day and night saying , Esther get the curse . Esther get the curse . Esther get the curse . Every hour I felt more bloated . Every time I went to the bathroom , I 'd look down , hoping for the blood , but I always knew it would n't be there . I began to plan for an abortion , but I did n't know how . I thought I knew a lot , but when I was face to face with the possibility that something was growing inside me against my will , I could n't believe it . But the fact that something was growing against my will comforted me in a strange way , because I really had nothing to do with it . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've never done anything unplanned . BUD Read me the letter . ESTHER My sister was there and I asked her to get me the doctor . I wanted him to give me a shot to bring on menstruation . BUD Read me the letter . I 'm ready to hear it now . ESTHER I begged my sister to get me the doctor . She hesitated and waited and stalled and found a million things to do . I grew weak and suddenly blood started to pour in spurts from my anus . The bloat from my insides came out the wrong way . I thought I was giving up my bones and my guts . I became paper-thin and shook all over . It happened so fast . I thought , this is how it is to die . Your body turns on you and everything comes out the wrong way . I begged her to get the doctor , but I kept slipping in my blood clots all over the floor . So much blood , I did n't know there could be that much in a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begged her to get the doctor . She left for a minute and when she came back she said the doctor would n't come . I said I needed him . p. 27 BUD Sweetheart . ESTHER She laughed and started to clean out her pocketbook . The doctor does n't waste his time on death you know , she said . He said anyone who bled like that would be dead before he got to the door and he had too much to do . Anyone who bled like that was nearly dead anyway , so he would n't come . I did n't believe she 'd really gone to the doctor , but I was afraid she had . SOUND : A car approaches . The dog barks . BUD I think it 's a Chevrolet . ESTHER You always did love that white car . BUD Nothing ever happened to it except a flat tire . ESTHER It got us where we wanted to go . BUD You can say that again . Never had any trouble . The hum of the motor  --  must be an Impala @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars . BUD They 're quiet as riding on a pin . ESTHER That 's what I mean . SOUND : Mynahs calling . BUD I probably should do it myself , but it 's no fun . And yet , it 's the only way . You can only do it yourself , and then there 's nobody to blame but yourself , but it 's mighty damn lonely to work like that . p. 28 ESTHER Do n't see why you 'd want to please them anyway . BUD Give me your hand . ESTHER Not till you check your bait . BUD All right . ESTHER Reel in the line . BUD All right . SOUND : A spinning reel . ESTHER There , I knew it . BUD Skunked . ESTHER Wha 'd I tell you ? BUD I thought sure that . . . ESTHER I 'm putting on a whole shrimp for you this time . BUD They 'll only gobble it . ESTHER Take a chance . BUD Do n't use a whole shrimp . He wo n't last thirty seconds out there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . ESTHER My mouth 's watering . . . . BUD You 'll see . It wo n't last thirty . . . How long did that last little bit you cast out go for ? SOUND : Spinning reel casting out . p. 29 ESTHER We 'll never know . You think you 're magic . You think the fish will walk right out of the water into the fry pan , with nothing in between but your will power . BUD It wo n't last . . . . ESTHER We 'll see . . . . Look there . Set the hook now ! Your rod 's bent double . Here , give it to me . BUD I did it . I got it . This is a big one . Weighs a ton . I ca n't lift the rod . ESTHER Walk backward . Walk backward up the beach . You 'll lose him in the surf . BUD Sweetheart . . . ESTHER Let me hold you , you 're shaking . BUD It wo n't stop .
