It looked like the end for Marshal Rooster Cogburn . Four varmints , their guns raised , their mounts ready , were waiting for the lawman at the edge of a birch grove . " I mean to kill you or see you hanged at Fort Smith , " rasps Cogburn . " Bold talk for a one-eyed fat man , " the outlaw leader shouts back . That does it . Clamping his reins in his teeth so he can use both his long-barreled revolver and his Winchester , the federal marshal lets out a whoop and begins a headlong charge across the grove . At the end of the shootout , the four villains have bitten the dust . The hero himself lies pinned beneath his steed . " Dammit , Bo , " he says to the horse . " First time ya ever gave me reason to curse ya . " Somehow it always looks like the end for John Wayne , and somehow it never quite is . There was the 1964 cancer bout that left him with one lung , but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a now-famous line : " I licked the Big C. " In 1969 , when his portrayal of paunchy , hard-drinking and profane old Rooster Cogburn won him the Academy Award , critics spoke of True Grit as the actor 's valedictory . ( The movie even ended with a farewell scene . ) They were wrong . Today , the Duke continues to lope through new oaters with the bravado , if not the speed , of that young prop man at Fox films some forty years ago by the name of Marion Michael Morrison . Even in his latest horse opera , The Cowboys , the stories persist that M. M. Morrison , alias John Wayne , is hanging up his gun . The film , which Warner Brothers chooses to call an epic , is about an old rancher who finds himself fathering and fuming over eleven boys on his last cattle drive across the West of the 1870 's . It is a different kind of role for Wayne and has prompted the film 's director , Mark Rydell , to say : " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mantle to a younger generation . I think he 's about ready . " The Duke himself would probably retort : " Nonsense . " ( Or words to that of fect . ) Old soldiers may fade away , but John Wayne just might ride on forever . Like Pearl Harbor or a Civil War battlefield , America 's biggest film money-maker has the power to stir men 's souls . People talk about John Wayne 's size-eighteen neck and his six-foot-four-inch , 225-pound frame . They say his hand is a boxing glove . But that part of the legend misses the point . The real legend of John Wayne is that he almost seems indestructible  --  or as nearly so as mortal man can be . Leathery is not the right metaphor . John Wayne is closer to iron . Someone once said that John Wayne movies are as alike as buffalo nickles : only the date changes ; even the Indian looks the same . If that is true of the plots - and there have been over 200 of those flickering frontiers and occasional battlefields over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star has played . The error , however , is in the identification of the character on screen with the man at home . Inevitably almost , the viewer today sees the Iron Duke against a career spanning four decades in which ( give or take a minor characteristic here and there , and changes of costume ) he has changed only by very slowly growing older . The pictures on the following pages do more than bear witness to the man 's aging . They represent the career of an actor who has been able to move easily from youthful swashbuckler to top-kick cowboy to archetypal hero of the Old West . In 1930 he played the role of hair-triggered son . In the forties he was the lean father figure , mustachioed and responsible , in movies like She Wore a Yellow Ribbon . And by the sixties he had galloped into the role of grand-paterfamilias . In True Grit , and , most recently , in The Cowboys , his face has the look of cracked granite , yet the essential John Wayne is there  --  jutting jaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too often the stuff of parody by comics on late-night talk shows and conse-quently , it becomes easy to forget that John Wayne is necessarily more subtle and complex a man than a ninety-minute roll of celluloid can reveal . Pigeonholers like to trace his might-is-right image back to his childhood when he supposedly found himself proving to every kid on the block that Marion was not a sissy 's name . Wayne 's detractors today charge that his politics , like his pictures , can be oversimplified , but a close look at the man indicates otherwise . He has been quoted as saying , for instance , that " There 's too much repression of young people today . So what if they want to tear loose once in a while ? Kids today take more interest in our society than we did . " Even with respect to his movies , Wayne admits how in the early days he went to work on the " John Wayne look . " He adds with a grin that he purely dreamed up his much-imitated way of walking and that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplicity to the script . Only John Wayne could look a pretty girl in the eye at the Alamo and say inthat famous punched inflection : " Republic is a beautiful word . " Audiences somehow do n't guffaw at those lines , and the reason must be because there is a brand of sincerity in John Wayne that we can not readily find elsewhere . " I 'm just the big tough boy on the side of right . " he once said of himself . " Simple themes . Save me from the nuances . All I do is sell sincerity , and I 've been selling the hell out of that ever since I started . " The start was slow . The boy born in Winterset , Iowa , moved with his family to the west coast , won a football scholarship to the University of Southern California , got into movies through the prop door , and then kicked around making bottom-of-the-bill cowboy pictures for nearly ten years . ( For part of that time he tried to carry a tune as Singin ' Sam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the part . ) Finally , in 1939 , the big break came when John Ford signed him to play the Ringo Kid in Stagecoach . The part called for a brave , inarticulate frontiersman seeking vengeance for his father 's murder . The film has since become a classic of the Western genre , a mixture of reverie and reverence about the American past that almost elevated itself to the level of folk art . After Stagecoach , the reputation of both the star and the director was secure . The Duke went on to archetypal casting , becoming with each movie the pristine man of nineteenth-century virtue  --  fearin ' God , but little else . Ford , of course , became the nonpareil sculptor of Western memories , to such an extent that critics finally concluded : " Well , if the real West was n't that way , it should have been . " Today , thirty-three years later , The Man is still up there on the screen . Those who know him say he could make as many as twenty more movies . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off Baja , California , or hunting deer in the Sierras . That is , when he 's not cruising on his 135-foot yacht ( a converted World War 11 mine sweeper ) . His several dozen grandchildren , his seven children , and his Peruvian wife Pilar will no doubt be there with him , providing the spoonful of honey so that the medicine of " retirement " will go down a little more easily . Warner Brothers , the producer of The Cowboys , allows no mistake to be made concerning John Wayne 's greatness . Because his films are pushing the $700-million mark in grosses , because he has starred in seventeen of the highest-earning films in motion-picture history , the Iron Duke , they say unabashedly , is the " undisputed box-office champion of all time in every country in the universe . " Not bad for a man who has carried a big iron on his hip for forty We went three and four afternoons a week , sat on folding chairs in the darkened Quonset but which served as a theater ; and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blew outside , that I first saw John Wayne . Saw the walk , heard the voice . Heard him tell the girl in War of the Wildcats that he would build her a house , " at the bend in the river where the cottonwoods grow . " As it happened , I did not grow up to be the kind of girl who is the heroine in a Western , and although the men 1 have known have had many virtues and have taken me to live in many places I have come to love , they have never been John Wayne , and they have never taken me to that bend in the river where the cottonwoods grow . Deep in that part of my heart where the artificial rain forever falls , that is still the line I wait to hear . I tell you this neither in a spirit of self-revelation nor as an exercise in total recall , but simply to demonstrate that when John Wayne rode through my childhood , and very probably through yours , he determined forever the shape of certain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man could fall ill , could carry within him that most inexplicable and ungovernable of diseases . The rumor struck some obscure dread , threw our very childhoods into question . In John Wayne 's world , John Wayne was supposed to give the orders . " Let 's ride , " he said , and " Saddle up . " " Forward ho , " and " A man 's got ta do what he 's got ta do . " " Hello , there , " he said when he first saw the girl , in a construction camp or on a train or just standing around on the front porch waiting for somebody to ride up through the tall grass . When John Wayne spoke , there was no mistaking his intentions ; he had a sexual authority so strong that even a child could perceive it . And in a world we understand early to be characterized by venality and doubt and paralyzing ambiguities , he suggested another world , one which may or may not have existed ever , but in any case existed no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could make his own code and live by it ; a world in which , if a man did what he had to do , he could one day take the girl and go riding through the draw and find himself home free , not in a hospital with something going wrong inside , not in a high bed with the flowers and the drugs and the forced smiles , but there at the bend in the bright river , the cottonwoods shimmering in the morning sun .
