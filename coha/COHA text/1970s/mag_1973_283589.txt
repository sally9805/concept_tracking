The mud-caked Ford van slid to a stop in front of a crumbling brick apartment house on Chicago 's 18th Street . Eight young men darted out of the van and into the building , and were barely inside when cries of " La migra ! La migra ! " echoed down the hallway . The warning that immigration agents might be near by sent the eight scurrying into an attic hideaway . After an edgy two hours , the men found out the cry had been a false alarm and they breathed a bit easier . <P> They were not apt to feel secure for long , however , since they were Mexicans who only 35 hours earlier had illegally crossed the border into the U.S. to take up life as mojados , or " wetbacks , " as they call themselves . The men were passengers on a modern underground railroad , a burgeoning smuggling network that has immigration officials perplexed as to how to stop it . <P> Until recently most illegal Mexican aliens have sought work and haven closer to home ; generally they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But now aspiring immigrants have started to head for the industrial cities of the Midwest . The majority aim for Chicago , where they can quickly fade into the city 's Latin population of 300,000 . One observer close to the Mexican community estimates that as many as 75,000 mojados are now in the Second City . <P> Stowaway Vans . No one knows for certain , but current estimates are that 50 to 100 men arrive every day . It is no easy trip . Often the mojados cross the border on their own and meet up with a smuggler on the other side . Then , for fees as high as $400 each , they are driven the 1,400 miles to Chicago . They hide out on the illegal journey in the smugglers ' cars , trucks and vans , sometimes stowing away in cardboard boxes or disappearing behind loads of watermelons and sacks of potatoes . One smuggler tucked his stowaways in his trunk , and supplied them with the needed air circulation by connecting fans in the trunk to the car 's cigarette-lighter outlet . <P> Smugglers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and must frequently take back roads and lengthy detours . Sophisticated smugglers , some of whom make $75,000 a year , employ two-way radios , lookout cars , and rented vehicles that are hard to trace . A few unscrupulous operators have even been known to recruit willing mojados , load them into a waiting vehicle at $250 a head , and then renege on the contract by dumping them 15 miles north of the Mexican border for a tidy profit with no risk involved , since their victims can hardly complain to the police . <P> Usually , however , the smugglers deliver their man north as promised , and even undertake to find a job for the alien once he has arrived . But for their employment services , the smugglers sometimes demand in addition up to half of a man 's salary for his first two months at work . Some smuggling rings also operate decrepit rooming houses and charge a man $35 a week to share a two-room apartment with four others .               @ @ @ @ @ @
