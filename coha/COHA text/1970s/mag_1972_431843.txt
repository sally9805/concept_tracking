 | Portiait of a Fierce and Fragile Land THE TUNDRA . It curves like an irregular beltway around the Arctic , fringing northern Alaska and Canada . It cuts across Greenland into European Russia and Siberia ( map , pages 306-307 ) . Harsh , treeless , sparsely peopled , it covers some three million square miles ? roughly a twentieth of the planet 's land surface . In the winter a cold , pale , distant sun appears only briefly on the southern horizon . Nose-diving temperatures sometimes approach minus 70 ? F. Summer temperatures in the tundra reach into the 70 's and 80 's , so the yearly range can be awesome . Life on the tundra finds that nature sets harsh terms ? among them , a scarcity of lifegiving precipitation . The region receives little more than some desert areas . Yet on the surface of this far-northern land lie immense quantities of water locked in ice for much of the year . And beneath the surface is a layer @#  | of ground called permafrost , whose temperature always remains below 32 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,000 feet thick in parts of Alaska 's North Slope and almost a mile deep in Siberia . For three-fourths of the year , the tundra is a frigid , hostile , seemingly lifeless realm . But in June a miracle begins . A never-setting summer sun brings forth plant species by the hundreds . Flowers appear ? delicate , and often astonishingly colorful . Swans , ducks , and geese from the south splash down on pristine lakes . They mate and nest and head south again before autumn puts a slick of ice on every pond . The angry whine of mosquitoes mingles with a low-keyed hum of other insects . Herds of caribou cast long , stalking shadows as they wander across a sun-skirted horizon in search of favorite victuals . Lemmings scurry over the tundra and marshland as they seek food and try to avoid predators . Foxes , wolves , owls , and predatory jaegers make life for other animals a hazardous adventure . The cackling of ptarmigans adds a sound of urgency to this briefly burgeoning world . Moose and grizzlies , some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valleys . Summer simply erupts in tundra country . It is a time for life ; in this startlingly finite season , reproduction must counter winter 's violence and death to keep nature in precarious balance . Then , as the first mantle of snow arrives , the smaller animals begin to disappear , burrowing under the white surface in quest of enough shelter and food to endure the long winter . Some , like the ground squirrel , hibernate ; others , like the lemming , remain active in their snowy tunnels . Insect eggs , larvae , and pupae lie hidden in the soil . Nimble yearrounders like the Arctic fox a realm that has again become grim , treacherous , deepfrozen . FOR CENTURIES the changing seasons of the tundra went unseen , except by Eskimos and an occasional explorer ? for what could draw man to a land as alien as this ? What indeed ? Petroleum prospectors discovered in 1968 that the oil reserves under the permafrost on Alaska 's North Slope were immense . They flew in to find ways to get the @# oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oil , hot from the earth 's depths , to an ice-free seaport far to the south. * Rugged as this land seemed , it was extremely fragile , and pipeline proponents had to take that aspect into account . Drive a bulldozer across the springy summer turf , and the tracks might remain for years . What would a hot pipeline do ? To find the answer , another type of " prospector " headed north ? the natural scientist . Entomologists , botanists , mammalogists , permafrost experts ? they probed for facts to show how to protect the delicate tundra . Now I was on my way north to observe the results of their studies and to see for myself the miracle of Arctic summer . As a biologist I have long been fascinated by the adaptation of living things to hostile environments , and there are few environments as hostile as the tundra . An hour before , my jet airliner had cleared the traffic pattern at Fairbanks , Alaska , and crossed the Arctic Circle . The tortuous Yukon River had come and gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes those vast Arctic plains called tundra slid unchangingly under the wings ; then the plane began its descent to Deadhorse . As the plane banked downward , I pressed my face against the cool plastic window and studied the awesome expanse below . The terrain was marked with strange patterns suggesting cross sections of a giant beehive ( pages 310-I1 ) . Innumerable mirrorlike ovals of standing water dotted the landscape . The notorious Alaskan mosquitoes greeted me when I stepped off the plane at Deadhorse . So did a British Petroleum Company truck , whose driver took me to the company 's @#  | field station a few miles away . There I met ecologists and environmentalists whose studies , sponsored primarily by the U. S. National Science Foundation as part of IBP , the International Biological Program , aim at a new understanding of the tundra ? the functioning and interaction of its soil , water , and climate , its marvelous plants , mammals , birds , insects , and microbes . Dr. Jerry Brown , the director of IBP 's Tundra Biome Program , was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're students of this northern ecosystem , and the tundra is our outdoor laboratory , " Jerry commented next day as we jeeped over a gravel road into the flat immensity of the . - Arctic never-never land . Oil had built the road we traveled , and Jerry pointed to the horizon where drilling rigs stood like toy towers . " They connect with a vast deposit nearly two miles down , " he said . " But it 's the surface world that interests us as ecologists . " Our truck pulled up at a roadside parking spot , and we walked to the top of a pingo that jutted like a tiny mountain 30 feet above the plain . These pingos form when permafrost surrounds water-saturated soil beneath a silt-filled lake . Gradually freezing , the water can not expand sideways or downward , and so it pushes upward , creating a mound with a thin overlay of soil and vegetation ( pages 306 and 308-9 ) . Jerry 's companions began testing and adjusting automatic meteorological instruments installed on the pingo . " This is good country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerry told me . " Our instruments measure precipitation and evaporation , humidity and wind velocity ? in fact , almost every physical variable . " Winter temperatures in the tundra are low enough to deepfreeze insect larvae and plants . Physiologists once assumed that such freezing would cause fluid in cells to crystallize , fatally damaging the microstructure of protoplasm . But all around me was evidence that life does indeed exist from year to year . Insects and plants in the tundra have developed chemical resistances ? built-in " antifreezes " ? as well as physical means of withstanding these very low temperatures . I wandered down off the pingo , lured by splashes of color on the flats , to wade through fields of flowers ? perky little blossoms that spend their short , unheeded lives under persistent , near-horizontal sunlight . There were familiar varieties ? poppies , buttercups , tussock sedges ? and scores of others quite new to me , poking through a cover of prostrate shrubs . Belly plants , one botanist called them . Back home , I 'd call them trees ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallow acid soil and exposed to extreme temperatures and strong winds , they grow only knee-high . On the tundra the time for flowering is frantically brief . I could almost feel in the air the harsh dictates of nature . I seemed to sense , in these bravely aspiring bits of life , the plea for just a little more sun , just a little more time to store away starches and proteins , to fortify the next generation for its winter ordeal . THE GROUND FELT YIELDING and springy as I walked . The surface was soft , in places mushy and mattressed with mosses . The living carpet included lichens , those strange members of the plant kingdom , two disparate botanic groups , algae and fungi , that mesh as one . Botanists believe that , in this curious union , the fungus provides structural support and possibly essential minerals , while the alga photosynthesizes busily to produce needed nutrients . The lichens are vitally important in the area 's biological economy , for they supply the fodder upon which so many Arctic herbivores depend . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caribou in Alaska and Canada , and their reindeer relatives in Europe and Asia . A favorite kind is Cladonia , one of several lichens called reindeer moss ( pages 320-21 ) . I pulled up a handful ; it had the feel and texture of a plastic kitchen sponge . Curious to discover what a caribou snack tasted like , I nibbled a bit of it . Like a plastic kitchen sponge ! Less than a yard beneath my waterproof boots lay permafrost , that unyielding , perennially frozen layer of earth . It blocks penetration by water , and there is little runoff because of the flatness of the terrain . Hence those thousands upon thousands of brooding , sky-reflecting water mirrors , and the mushiness underfoot ( painting , next pages ) . It 's difficult to realize how structurally fragile the impervious-looking tundra really is . So delicately balanced a relationship exists between the tundra plants and the soil beneath them that compressions of any sort , even footpaths , may leave long-lasting scars . Whenever I took a walk on the tundra , each  | step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the least damage ? Alaska state regulations require that vehicles stay off the tundra during summer 's thaw , except for emergencies and scientific projects . Otherwise , ground transport is undertaken only in winter , when the surface is frozen . Meanwhile , researchers conduct tests on shrubs and grasses from all over the Arctic world to determine which would be helpful if tundra reseeding proves practical . Other researchers investigate the strange ways evolved by tundra insects to assure the survival of their kind . " Here 's one that has developed an astonishing way to get its young through the first harsh winter , " entomologist Mark Deyrup told me one day . He pointed to a pinned specimen he 'd taken . " It 's a warble fly , a fuzzy relative of the common housefly . It affixes its eggs to a caribou 's abdominal hairs in the fall . The hatching larvae burrow into the skin and work their way into the back tissues . All through the winter , the larvae have a warm home inside the animal . By the time they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer will have begun . " Insects , food supply , weather , terrain , and the mating urge figure in the complex migration cycles of caribou , a subject only vaguely understood . Alaska 's two northern herds , whose estimated 440,000 animals constitute two-thirds of the caribou in the state , move between the south side of the Brooks Range and the North Slope in a generally northsouth pattern . Pregnant cows go north in the spring to bear their calves on the tundra ( pages 336-7 ) , and the bulls follow . By fall the herds are back on the wooded south slopes of the Brooks Range for mating , and they remain all winter . But what would happen if massive herds met an oil pipeline on their northward journey ? Would it divert them ? Near Prudhoe Bay the oil industry built a two-mile stretch of four-foot fence- to simulate a pipeline . At intervals ramps of earth allowed passage over the barrier . Some sections were on a trestle , allowing passage below . Last summer about 1,000 animals confronted the fence as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or under it ; those that did not retreat moved parallel to the fence until they could skirt one end ? hinting that an above-ground pipeline may in fact prove a serious barrier to migration .  | From Prudhoe Bay I journeyed to Barrow , an area where Eskimos still hunt seal and walrus in icy waters , to visit the U. S. Navy 's wellequipped Arctic Research Laboratory . Several studies of the tundra are under way there , including an intensive program to find out more about that furry , fist-size grazer , the lemming ( page 331 ) . Investigators are interested in lemmings ' seasonal movements , of course , but of even greater interest are the little creatures ' population explosions that occur every three or four years . Lemmings ? both the brown and the collared species ? are among the most prolific of mammals . In many ways , life on the tundra is geared to the population cycles of lemmings . When lemmings become abundant , the numbers of owls , foxes , and weasels start to soar , for the small rodents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the tundra 's plant life during a peak population year . Winter 's snows do not save the plants , for the animals burrow under the white mantle and eat just about everything that is vegetable , except for a few mosses and lichens . They may strip limited areas so thoroughly that the next summer 's melt-off will bare the soil to deeper thawing and possible erosion . Such stripped areas will then feed fewer animals . When lemming numbers outrun the food supply , their populations dwindle . Hungry predators hunt them more fiercely , causing further inroads , or turn instead to other sources of food , such as nesting birds , and bird numbers decline ? further extending the chain effect of lemming population cycles . At an " intensive study site " of the Tundra Biome Program near the Navy 's lab at Barrow , I examined an elaborate series of live-catch traps , designed to assay lemming density . Lemming population was on the rise @#  | that summer of 1971 , and this year may see an even bigger crop . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was forced to jump across shallow gullies in the sloshy terrain segments of those weirdly shaped polygons I 'd seen earlier from the air . Some of the polygons measured only a few feet across ; others spanned a hundred feet or more . Viewed from the ground , their beautiful geometry was lost . From Fairbanks to Barrow , I found Arctic environmentalists worried about the possibility of oil spills on the tundra . What weapons could be used to fight such damage ? Possibly some very small weapons ? microbes . Scientists know that certain onecelled organisms can " biodegrade " oil ? that is , break it down into chemical compounds that are no longer harmful . If their effectiveness could be increased with nutrients that would help them multiply , perhaps they could render inactive the petroleum hydrocarbons and mitigate the effects of a spill . That type of experimentation is going on at Barrow . Small , controlled " spills " are being tried on tundra and in ponds . It is a highly sophisticated exercise in biochemistry , though . In order to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barrow area are also being studied . T OWARD THE END of August , with the air already picking up a touch of early autumn , I left Fairbanks on the last leg of my Alaska odyssey . In a rented car I loafed southward along the splendid Richardson and Glenn Highways . Fading lupines and fireweed gone to seed lined my hardsurfaced path . Overhead , wedges of calling geese moved south . The road wound up through Isabel Pass between sky-piercing peaks , whose snow mantles were already invading the lower slopes . I looked up past timberline , where autumn 's tundra glowed ? not with the splashy yellows and oranges of a New England fall , but in soft , somber hues ? dull reds , subdued browns . Surely there was time for one more stroll . I pulled off the road and left the car . Skirting a still , blue-black pond , I felt eyes on me . They belonged to a moose , belly deep in the water . Concerned with my approach , but hardly alarmed , she took a long look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another dripping mouthful of water plants . Except for the male during rutting season , and the female with young , the Alaska moose is not a particularly aggressive animal , and this lady seemed not at all unfriendly . I moved on , climbing a resilient carpet of lichens and moss toward the higher alpine tundra . The shrubbery that tugged at my khakis sagged with ripening berries ? autumn food for grizzlies ( pages 332-3 ) . Well , if a grizzly should wander by , I could take comfort in the knowledge that he 'd prefer to munch on those berries instead of on me . My car was now a mere dot down on the highway , for I 'd climbed upward some 500 feet . I picked a convenient rock , suitably upholstered with lichens , and sat down . The mountain view was fabulous . What a contrast , I mused , to the melancholy flatlands five hundred miles to the north . Lifting the binoculars from my chest , I focused on the pond below . Now it was deserted ; the moose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pond would be ice-covered . The moose would seek sheltering clumps of willow . Ground squirrels would go into their burrows ; how many , I wondered , would be flushed out next year by bulldozers ? While the North Slope oil controversy swirls back home , those scores of persistent scientists continue probing the tundra 's ecosystem . All their bits and pieces of information will be fitted together to give us a clearer picture of how the tundra works . Perhaps then we 'll find a solution that can satisfy oilmen and environmentalists alike . They say there is an urgent need for the oil that lies beneath the slope . But there 's an urgent need to protect the tundra , too ? that immensely desolate , immensely beautiful , immensely fragile land . fl
