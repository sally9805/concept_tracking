To the benefit and bewilderment of air travelers , airlines and travel agents have devised a jumble of cut-rate charter plans that drastically reduce the cost of flying . Last week the Civil Aeronautics Board approved still another plan , called ABC , or " advance booking charter . " Unlike current plans , ABC eases restrictions and makes cheap charter air travel more flexible and available to almost everyone . <P> Scheduled to go into effect Oct. 7 , ABC would require passengers to make reservations 45 days in advance for flights to some European countries and 30 days in advance to most other destinations , v. up to 60 days now . Eliminated would be requirements for joining clubs or other " affinity " groups , or for buying a tour package that can include hotel accommodations and some meals-a feature undesirable to travelers who want lower charter fares . Minimum stay requirements have also been trimmed to seven days for Europe ( v. ten days now ) , and cut altogether for North America . Travelers will be able to board weekend charters for Las @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fought ABC from the time it was proposed in February , but after last week 's approval showed some acceptance . United Airlines , which dominates the domestic charter business with 50% of the flights , said that ABCs will " provide air transportation to a greater segment of the American public , " and that United will begin selling ABC flights when they go into effect . TWA , however , made its unhappiness known . ABC , it said , " removes more of the restrictions which in the past have distinguished charters from the scheduled airlines . " <P> Far Cheaper . The CAB did try to build some limits into the ABC plan so as not to entirely undercut the scheduled carriers . Airlines or charter operators , for example , may cancel a flight altogether under ABC if enough passengers do not show up ; they may also change arrival and departure dates . Passengers who cancel will forfeit what the CAB described as a " substantial portion " of ticket costs . ABC also will be restrained by other rules , such as prohibiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fully booked , so prices may well be pegged high enough to offset excessive cancellations . The result : charter fares will go down , but not dramatically . Pan American estimates the round-trip New York-London ABC fare at $350 , not substantially below the $358 offered by another plan . Both charter fares , however , are far cheaper than the standard coach fare of $676.
