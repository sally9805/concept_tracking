Still spending , but also cutting fun , frills and other nonessentials <P> Before I 'll pay what they want me to I 'll just live without it , ' Cause I 'll never doubt , You ca n't ration nothing I ai n't done without . <P> So go the lyrics of a new country-and-western ditty that has come out of Atlanta and was written by Georgia 's Lieutenant Governor Zell Miller . Miller 's lament may never make the Top Forty , but a great many of his countrymen surely share his gloom about having to " do without . " As in past times of leaping prices and deepening economic slump , Americans are taking seriously the task of cutting back their household budgets . <P> Typically , the first question is what necessities are really necessary . Even in a pinch , most Americans are reluctant to cut expenditures for such practical aspects of their lives as tuition , rent , utility bills and essential or even vacation travel . In consequence , they start out by trimming what economists call discretionary spending : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely essential to daily life and work . <P> Such cutting seems to become more imperative each month . The Government reported last week that consumer prices rose 1% in July , which is an annual rate of 13.1% , and thus extended the present stretch of double-digit inflation to a full seven months . At the same time , the spending power of Americans has continued to decline . Mostly because of inflation , but also because taxes have been creeping upward , the actual buying power that people have been getting from the money in their paychecks has declined by nearly 4% over the past twelve months . So more and more , almost as a matter of survival , discretionary spending is being cut back . <P> Compared with past downturns , some of the current cutting is following unusual patterns . In previous recessions , forms of entertainment and diversion such as books , records and movies flourished during hard times because they were relatively inexpensive . But they are no longer so cheap , and therefore no longer recession-proof . <P> With the average novel costing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $18 or more , hard-cover sales are down by nearly 10% compared with last year ; even " quality " paperbacks selling in the $4 range are gathering dust on publishers ' bookshelves . <P> Sales of records , meanwhile , are off even more sharply . Some stores are reporting sales declines of as much as 40% this year ; with albums now costing $9 or more , many music buffs have stopped buying , or have discovered that they can save money by tape-recording their friends ' records . <P> Some signs of rebellion over climbing movie-ticket prices are also appearing . When some of Atlanta 's first-run theaters raised the cost of admission from $3.50 to $3.75 this summer ( it has risen in New York City to as high as $5 for some movies ) , smaller houses in more remote shopping centers began drawing sizable crowds by cutting prices to as low as 99 for recent but hardly fresh offerings like Rocky II .
