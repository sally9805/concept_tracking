 | We were four degrees above the Line and the unaccustomed heat made the men skittish and unruly . Vicious fights erupted without cause . One of my own mariners was murdered in a quarrel over two farthings ' worth of beer , his belly ripped open with a broadsword and his guts spilled into the sea . The murderer was no more than a boy , being but sixteen or seventeen years at the most , and his friends swore that the quarrel had been the dead man 's fault , and yet I made of this youth an example that I would have no disorders upon my ship , for I commanded that he be hanged from the yardarm above the forecastle where the mariners slept , and there his corpse hung for two days in the sun , a  | very evident warning , until the stench becoming extreme by way of the putrefaction of the flesh , I ordered that the body be cut down and cast into the sea . In this manner , cruel and arbitrary though it may seem , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had our general enterprise been conducted with equal sanity the story I have to tell might be different . At this time , on account of the general distemper of the men , the Admiral made a speech upon each of the vessels of the fleet , and coming to mine own galleon , The Fortune , he spoke such honeyed words that he bewitched the entire company , charming them into content like a maker of music subduing wild beasts . He described how the earth is like the body of a man , through whose veins run pure gold like some infinitely previous balsamum or blood , and these veins spread from their center in the Americas to the limits of the globe ; yet the farther they travel the more corrupt the ore becomes until at last it is no gold at all but iron such as we dig in England . He had heard , he said , many complaints of the heat in this place , but they were ignorant who did not know that as the heart is the warmest organ of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for what is gold at bottom but a kind of earthy fire ? We were now at the very heart of the earth , he said , and this was the reason for the heat but also for the  | great wealth we should find . Here , twenty years before , he and Keymis had discovered a great wonder , a palpitating mountain , sweating massy gold , and this he swore he had seen with his own eyes and Keymis had seen it too . Why , the Spanish had not begun to scratch the true wealth of America , for from this mine we should procure as much in three months as they laboriously accumulate in three years . He saw us all , he said , metamorphosed into lords of Oriental splendor , garbed in silks and feathers , with coffers of jewels and spices and pearls , and this should be the fortune not of the gentlemen only but of every common mariner who had trusted him and sailed to Guiana . Here the men cheered , for like fools they believed him , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described , to make lords of common drudges . But in the main I believed him too and did not doubt that I should return from Guiana a very great man . The Admiral reminded them now how petty were their complaints and jealousies , for there was plenty of gold for all to share , both those who sailed upriver to the mine and those who remained to guard the river mouth , and he said that in an adventure such as this we must each of us have faith in our companions , as alone and unaided not one of us could accomplish a thing . Indeed , said he , we were in a kind a little common- wealth and each of us must be willing to labor for the common good . One of the men upon the hatches boldly interrupted , saying that he had been chosen to sail upriver with Raleigh , but what was to come of them , he asked , if the Spanish arrived and drove off Keymis and the galleons from the river mouth ? For he did not relish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rot or be eaten by cannibals . Why , said Raleigh , Captain Keymis was a valiant man , wherefore he could not understand this distrust of him on the mariners ' parts . He had known Keymis for thirty years , he said , and he had more confidence in him than in any other man in the world . If the Spanish arrived , Keymis would defeat them no less surely than he himself would do , and so there was naught to fear upon that score . The stubborn mariner , however , said the others might do as they pleased , but as for himself , if Keymis commanded the galleons , he would not go upriver , and there were many others , he said , who would refuse it as well . Hearing this , the men began to hoot and cheer to show that they , too , were of this fellow 's mind , but Raleigh called them to order and spoke sweetly to them again , assuring them that in all he did he had nothing but the common good in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of the gold , describing how every grain  | upon his mountain grew as big as a bean or a chick-pea at the least , so that all our ballast for the return voyage would be nothing but gold and we should perhaps have to go short rations as there would be so much gold that little space would remain for food . In this fashion he played upon them until they forgot for the moment their distrust of Keymis , for he was like a conjurer so able was he to draw them whichever way he wished , their own hunger for wealth delivering them into his hands . But when they were dismissed and he spoke to me in private , I perceived that he was in fact extremely wroth , for now he cursed the men as scum , a tribe of felons and thieves together with a few palsied fishermen , complaining that it was the greatest misfortune in the world that he had lived to see an age when no better company of adventurers might be raised , for it had not been thus in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But things had declined sadly , he said , and corrupted and decayed , and even himself was enfeebled with years , and nothing was as it should be any longer . He continued very passionate for some time , complaining of the tyrannous manner in which fortune had used him , for when at last he had the chance to recover his position in the world , she clapped upon him such a company of wretches as this , which truly he feared would bring us all to ruin . Raleigh being gone , the men returned to grum- bling , for those chosen to sail with the Admiral wished to remain with Keymis , thinking it more desirable to await the Spanish in comfort than venture into the interior , where there might be any number of unknown dangers , as cannibals and pestilence and beasts of prey . But those who were to stay upon the galleons complained that Raleigh 's party planned to shark up all the profits , for they believed that very little of the gold would find its way into the common store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was dissatisfied , truly wishing neither to sail with Raleigh nor to remain with Keymis , but wanting to thrive as if by magic without labor or risk . And to some degree the Admiral himself was to blame for these discontents , for , advertising the adventure in England , he had made it appear such an easy means to wealth , describing the country as so fair and healthful and so rich besides , that many conceived there was no more to do than cross the sea and gather the nuggets upon the strand , and these were now bitter to discover it was not so . The riot that led to the mutiny started several days later as the company of Keymis 's ship , The Good Hope , were at supper . Evidently the extreme heat of that unhealthy climate , together with the natural moisture of the sea , penetrated to that part of the hold in which the victuals lay , causing them to corrupt , and especially the salt  | beef , which , as I was told , turned yellow and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient to make any man sick . The cook complained of this foul beef to Keymis , but he , being concerned with preparations in case the Spanish should arrive , was of no mind to worry about food , wherefore he replied that the beef must be served . The meat being set before them , the mariners waxed wroth , demanding that the cook appear and explain why they should be used in so insolent a fashion . But the cook feared to leave his cookroom , whereupon half a dozen of the most passionate stormed this fortress and hauled him before the others , he protesting all this time that it was upon the captain 's orders that he had served them the beef . The men , not caring whether it were truly Keymis 's order or no , but commencing to enjoy themselves better than they had for many weeks past , now fell to making sport of the cook , compelling him to eat of his own meat , which he was very loath to do . So unkindly did they handle him that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well except that one among them cried out for them to seize the hold and procure some decent meat . The hold was locked , and the boatswain , who was then in command of the ship , Keymis having spent the afternoon on The Destiny overseeing the reaming of her ordnance , naturally refused to  | yield the key , but rather threatened them with whipping and divers other punishments if they failed to return to order . The men , however , the one part of them still passionate and the other being now in a holiday humor , paid scant heed to these threats and replied by knocking him over the head with a stool . In the hold they found that every barrel was putrid , wherefore some in their anger commenced hauling the barrels onto the hatches and heaving them into the sea . Others , ignoring the beef , turned to the great butts of beer that stood about among the victuals , so that within a short time the larger part of the company of The Good Hope was fairly well soused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat was served had by this time joined their fellows ' merrymaking . My ship lying alongside The Good Hope , the disorders upon Keymis 's vessel , like an infection , rapidly spread to my own ; but whereas Keymis 's men merely rioted , mine rose up in earnest , throwing open the armory and passing about muskets and pikes . And yet each man was wroth for a different cause , some seeking revenge for the youth that was hanged , others wishing to choose whether they were to sail upriver or stay with the galleons , but the most part , I believe , determined in this manner to compel the Admiral to alter his plans and himself remain with the galleons.  | I sought to bring the men to reason , but they were so nearly mad there was no way I might perform it , save I possessed the Admiral 's eloquence , which I do not , being but a plainspoken sailor . Moreover , there were a great many of them , and some among them who wished to see me hanged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had but my sword and pistols , and my single companion was my lieutenant , John Williams , who had ever been faithful to me in time of trial and yet nevertheless was but one man only , and for all these reasons , and whether it were right or wrong I do not know , I yielded myself to them , requesting only that they not hang me or otherwise exercise their wrath upon me . There were those who nevertheless desired to hang me , and my lieutenant as well , although God knows they had no grievance against him , but at last the wiser sort so far prevailed that they permitted Williams and myself to depart in a boat and take refuge upon The Destiny . This word they commanded me to carry to the Admiral , that they held The Fortune hostage and would not fail to sink her even there in the river mouth if he did not consent to remain with the galleons . Williams and I descended , and , having no men to row us , we were constrained each to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was I reduced by circumstance and rebellion from commander of a great galleon to  | being mine own oarsman in a cockboat . Having escaped from The Fortune , we saw that the fourth galleon , The Star , which before had been hidden , lying upon the other side and upwater of The Good Hope , was also in disorder , and indeed so was every vessel except The Destiny herself , where the Admiral maintained his command . We boarded The Destiny and there were greeted by Captain Griffiths , the master of The Star , who , like Keymis , had been with Raleigh when the disorders began and was unable to return to his ship . I found the Admiral together with his son , Wat Raleigh , who served as captain of The Destiny under his father , and explained to them what had happened upon The Fortune and what the men threatened to do . Wat was angry and blamed me for deserting my command , volunteering himself to lead an armed party from The Destiny to board and recover the vessel . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life at twenty times The Fortune , and yet he , too , blamed me for having left the ship . Keymis at this time had returned to The Good Hope , seeking to restore order there , but as it happened he was inadvertently the cause of even more disorder than before , for , thinking to frighten and chastise the men and thus recall them to their duties , he inquired what would occur if even now , whilst they were in such disarray , the Spanish arrived . Being fearful and besotted besides ,  | and the vessel in such great confusion , certain of the men conceived their captain was telling them to break out arms and prepare to defend themselves , and at this moment one who had drunk the most and was none too clear in the head , the evening light moreover being very deceptive , espied upon the horizon a long , low cloud , which he took to be the sails of the very armada Keymis meant , and so began the cry that the Spanish were at hand . This error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armada was but a cloud , and yet in the press and rush of men , all crying that the enemy was at hand , he might not make himself heard . And now the men upon The Fortune and The Star also yielded to terror and fell to readying the ordnance but in the most disorderly fashion imaginable , having no one in authority to maintain discipline over them , and presently chaos was come upon the entire fleet , the men of the divers companies crying out , both at each other and at us upon The Destiny , and some beginning to fire their muskets into the air , although with what intent was not clear , so that what with the cries and the firing it sounded for all the world as though a great battle was in progress even though no enemy was to be seen . All this the Admiral beheld in anguish from the poop of The Destiny , and indeed he was near despair , proclaiming to his son that he was ready to sail back to England and live a ruined man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currish tribe of mariners nothing might be accomplished , wherefore he would rather return to prison , if the King desired it , than be Admiral of this fleet . Wat Raleigh , however , believed that if only he might cross to The Good Hope or The Fortune he could bring them to reason , and , as he was well loved by the men for his boldness and youth , he might truly have performed it , if any man could . But Raleigh would not permit him to stir from his side , saying there was naught he might do in such madness except maintain order upon his own vessel , and if each captain had done the same there never would have been any difficulty in the first place . At this point there came a cry from the forecastle that The Star was afire , and we could see from the poop that there were indeed flames upon the ship 's waist , as evidently a powder butt had exploded whilst the men were preparing the ordnance . Without question it would have been possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company , but the mariners appeared merely to be dashing about in distraction , the most part more concerned with the rescuing of their belongings than the saving of the ship . Indeed many were already leaping into the sea , although there was no need yet for any such despairing action . Moreover , those vessels that lay close by The Star , instead of dispatching  | boats to assist in the putting down of the fire , were even now hoisting sails to move farther off lest they be in any danger themselves . Finding that his ship was like to be lost unless something were quickly done , Griffiths ran to the hatches and leapt into the sea , pulling himself into one of the jolly boats . At the same moment Wat Raleigh followed after , ignoring his father 's command to stay where he was , and so these two rowed together for The Star . They might have saved her except my men upon The Fortune , having got their mainsail set and their anchors weighed , were crossing the jolly boat 's bow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , together with their haste to flee the neighborhood of the burning ship , did not hear Wat 's order for them to give way , or whether they merely refused to obey , I can not tell ; but The Fortune held her course and , ramming the skiff upon the bows , hurled her backwards , capsizing her and plunging the two men into the sea . Seeing this , the Admiral cried out , and 1 believe he would have thrown himself into the water , old and unfit as he was , for it appeared certain that they had been knocked witless in the mishap and would surely drown . But presently we perceived them thrashing in the water , by great good fortune unharmed , having evidently been drawn beneath the galleon 's keel . And now the Admiral cursed those men upon my ship , saying  | every one of them deserved to be hanged . Moreover , Wat Raleigh at last being plucked from the sea , he was no less wroth with him than he had been with my men , for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , he would have him whipped for disobedience to his commands . At this moment there was a great explosion aboard The Star , the flames , driven by the evening breeze , having reached the aftercastle and the armory where the powder was stored . The blast was an awesome sight and a wonder to behold , for it flung fiery fragments like shooting stars into the heavens . The entire aftercastle burst into flame , whereupon the fire , like a living thing , sped along her shrouds and lines , racing to the height of her masts so that for a minute or so , until the rigging burned through and fell to the hatches , she was all outlined in fire and looked like some weird devil ship sailed by fiends out of Hell . The danger was that , burning through her anchor cables , The Star would fall adrift in the river , becoming a present peril to the entire fleet and especially to The Destiny , which lay about a hundred and fifty yards directly downstream of her . Indeed at this moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the other , the current sending her even amongst those men in the waters who had leapt from her hatches before in a shift to save themselves by swimming .  | But now these cried out very piteously as the galleon bore down upon them , dropping flaming sails and timbers on all sides , so that many were killed and more injured , there being no means to succor them at the time . Meanwhile , The Star herself was fast disintegrating , her masts having all fallen , the aftercastle collapsed , and the ribs themselves , like bones in a rotted carcass , exposed where the timbers had fallen away . The Admiral , perceiving the jeopardy to The Destiny , ordered the mainsail raised and the ship maneuvered as near to The Star as possible that we might attempt to sink her before she became entirely free . And so at Raleigh 's command the gunners fired a volley of sixteen-pounders , the balls crashing through her hull and opening great wounds or rather windows onto the inferno within her . But there was this melancholy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water died , both on account of the burning timbers flung down and by a number of the balls falling to one side . Upon the second volley , The Star commenced to list as the sea poured into her hold , and on the third she lay broadside on the water , the fires hissing as they plunged into the sea , and thus slowly and by degrees she sank to the bottom . This spectacle we observed from The Destiny 's poop , and when it was done , I expressed my grief to Griffiths that his vessel should be lost in such a  | terrible fashion , adding that I hoped he bore it stoically and like a Christian . He replied that indeed there were a good many thousand pounds gone with the sinking of that ship , and yet he trusted still that the mine would prove sufficiently rich to justify his venture . Why good , said I , but in any case he must mourn the loss of the vessel , for she was a passing fair galleon , carefully and lovingly wrought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school of building . Griffiths answered that truly he rated her but as a ship , for , having turned mariner out of no particular love of the sea , he had not that extreme affection for nails and boards that he had observed in some others . The Admiral , greatly dismayed by the burning of The Star and the near-calamity to The Destiny , concluded now that he must yield to the common desires of the mariners and permit Keymis to lead the expedition to the mine in his stead . It grated him , he said , thus to alter the disposition of matters merely to suit the whim of the ignorant , and yet if any order was to be established and the fleet preserved , it must be done . This word he bade me carry to my men upon The Fortune and Griffiths was to bear it to Keymis and his company on The Good Hope . Meanwhile Wat would inform the pinnaces and he himself would address the company of The Destiny , who were so far superior to the others that they alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my ship , I found the mariners somewhat chastened and ashamed on account of what had occurred . But when I told them of the Admiral 's decision , they cheered as if they had achieved a great victory . It made me mad to hear them hoot and shout when a fair galleon had been lost and many men drowned and all the result of their mischief and that of their fellows : wherefore I delivered them a very passionate sermon , saying they had better by far fall upon their knees and ask mercy for what they had done than cheer at the news I brought them , for even here in this savage land , I assured them , the justice of God was at work , and those who had done well would be rewarded , but malefactors would be treated according to their deserts .  | The following morning there arose a certain difficulty with the Admiral 's new plan . Calling the captains together , Raleigh revealed to us now what heretofore he had told to no man . He knew , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish , and it was well known that he was no lover of Spain himself : nevertheless , England and Spain were at peace , and it was the King 's desire that the nations continue in amity . For this reason , knowing well that the Spaniard claimed all this region as his own , albeit the claim was neither reasonable nor just , the King had been reluctant to permit the present expedition . Moreover , out of ancient enmity to himself , James did not care to assist in any scheme 20 1 GOLDING 'S TALE  | that might help him to thrive . And yet Raleigh had , in such feeling terms , described the richness of Guiana and the infinite stream of gold that should flow from this mine into James 's hands , that he at last persuaded the King to allow the voyage , offering to him the one-half of all the gold found . Before permitting it , however , James swore a great oath to Raleigh that if a single Spanish subject were harmed , the Admiral 's own life was forfeit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to the King 's pleasure at the time . Raleigh protested that they might be attacked upon the high seas and were they then to submit meekly to the slaughter ? To which the King replied that in such a case they might defend themselves , but under any other circumstances , and especially if they encountered any Spanish by land , they must neither attack nor reply to any attack , under penalty of death . And thus , the Admiral said , we might see that not his fortune merely but his very life depended upon our prudence , and it was on this account that he had been loath to allow any but himself to command the expedition upriver . Hearing this , Keymis was dismayed as he never suspected any such cruel terms had been made , and now he begged Raleigh to reconsider leading the expedition himself , for he did not wish so great a burden as the Admiral 's life to  | be laid upon him . But Raleigh answered that it must be so , as otherwise there would never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . If the Admiral must remain behind , was it not fitter that he name Wat the expedition 's commander , being his son and well trusted by the mariners besides ? As for himself , he would gladly serve as Wat 's lieutenant to bring him to the mine , and he would follow the son as faithfully as ever he had followed the father . But Raleigh replied that he trusted Keymis above any other on earth . Moreover , he intended his son to remain with himself on The Destiny . At this Wat Raleigh leapt up astonished and protested that he had not crossed the sea to sit idle on The Destiny whilst others less worthy than himself adventured and fronted danger on the river . And Keymis added that if Wat remained behind and all the responsibility was his own then he would not go forth at all . Neither might be swayed from his determination , wherefore the Admiral perceived that he must give over his desire to keep his son with him . It was concluded that Keymis and Wat should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge to be placed in his son 's hands , and this arrangement pleased Wat very well and indeed it pleased the others of us too . Three days of labor remained before we were  | ready to depart , but at last , on the morning of the fourth day following the burning of The Star and the tenth since we arrived in Guiana , we left behind the Admiral and the three remaining galleons and commenced our journey upriver to the mine . The river being in certain places too shallow and constricted to admit any vessel of heavy draught , we had with us only the lighter ships , and these were three pinnaces under the commands of Keymis , Wat , and Griffiths , together with a sailing barge under my command . We numbered in all just above three hundred souls and carried provisions sufficient for about six weeks . The Admiral parted with us most gravely , clasping us each by the hand and reminding us how he depended upon our good success . So cheerless did he seem that he might have been dispatching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Keymis was no less solemn than his master , pledging that he would be as loyal to Raleigh in this endeavor as he had been faithful on all occasions in the past . But Wat , being of a more sanguine and youthful composition , and therefore vexed to see such melancholy faces upon what seemed to him so auspicious an occasion , burst out laughing and accused Keymis and Raleigh of being as tearful and ridiculous as a pair of turtledoves parted by fortune and vowing to be true . Why , he said , he trusted to return within two  | months as rich as any prince , and in that prospect he saw no matter for tears . As for his father , he hoped the Spanish did not appear , but if they did , he knew the Admiral would give them such a rebuff as they would never again offer to meddle in an enterprise that bore the name of Raleigh . And so , giving the Admiral a manly embrace , he bade him adieu . We sailed at about nine in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good progress even against the current . The river , or rather branch , for we were not yet upon the Orinoco proper , extended at this point perhaps a quarter of a league in breadth , the land on either bank being low and flat , covered with a kind of scrub grass except here and there an empty , marshy place . We observed divers birds , storks , herons , cormorants , and such , but hardly any other signs of life . Towards evening , however , one of my men espied a great serpent in the water of the kind the Spanish call anaconda , and this beast , he said , must have been near twenty foot in length . The sighting of the anaconda caused a great stir among the men , in particular among those who never before were out of England , and I myself spent above an hour staring into the water for a sight of the monster if he might still be somewhere about , and yet I never saw him . The following day the river spread somewhat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descry gentle , sloping hills , and on them mangoes , cassavas , palms , and divers other trees . There were greater numbers of birds as well , and not only storks and herons but macaws and parrots and brilliant gillybirds , these latter gathering by the score on the tops of the trees , producing an extraordinary and colorful sight . Even the heat seemed less intense in this region , so that all our spirits greatly improved , the men singing as they rowed , with lighter hearts than at any time since we left England . The country , as we proceeded , waxed ever more luxuriant , the trees thicker and heavier with fronds , the birds still more abundant than before , until it seemed we had discovered an earthly paradise , exceeding all expectation . In this excellent country there dwelt a nation of savages that Raleigh and Keymis visited on their first venture into Guiana , passing considerable time in their city and learning from them about the regions and peoples along the banks of the river . Indeed the king of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and William , for so they christened this savage prince , accompanied them at that time on all their journeys and explorations . We attained this city on the fifth day after leaving Raleigh , and here were very hospitably welcomed by William , himself now the king , his father having died some years before . We brought for them many useful gifts , as knives , hatchets ,  | axes , saws , and also certain baubles that savages relish , and they requited us with presents of deers and porks as well as great baskets of melons and cassava breads , together with fish and fruits and such other excellent provisions as the country affords . The simple savages regarded our company with marvelous awe and respect , bowing and kissing the feet of even the common mariners amongst us as if they were gods or idols , a superstitious reverence that ought to be repugnant to any Christian man ; and yet this ceremony pleasured the mariners and they encouraged them in it , rewarding them for their attentions with scraps of cloth and bits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the savages treated as relics . And to obtain these trifles they would give whatever the men asked , including bows and spears and other things of value , until at last we ordered that the men were not to cozen them in this way . These Caribs , as they are called , are in fact a most fierce and warlike nation and as far removed in perfection from ourselves as we from the angels . Nevertheless , they live in very good order amongst themselves , serving their king with such honor that if we should perform the same respect to our Lord and Redeemer there would be no more wickedness among us . They dwell all together in long buildings made of mud and covered with the bark of trees , each house or hall af 26 GOLDING 'S TALE  | fording shelter for perhaps three hundred souls , wherein each man has his own hammock , but all things else , such as provisions , weapons , and dogs , of which they keep a great number for hunting , all these they hold entirely in common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amongst the entire nation , except the king 's wives , which are three in number and belong to him alone . As for clothing , they neither have any nor need any , the climate being so mild that like our first parents they commonly go about entirely naked without shame , and in this they are the very image of the golden age . This indeed was some problem to us , for the women being , many of them , of a sufficiently fair complexion and good feature and stark naked besides , we feared our men might fall to ravaging them and thereby cause offense , and to prevent this we issued stern orders and kept close watch that it might not occur . The men are of a most foul appearance , for their teeth they file to sharp points and their faces and shoulders besides are covered with a kind of tattoos very dreadful to behold . These tattoos , I learned , are extremely painful in the making , and yet it is a great point among them never to show fear or pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tattoos are being made , he is immediately slain and the body cast into the river as fit only for fishes to eat . But this happens very rare- ly . Armor of any kind they foolishly scorn , and they fight as they live , naked as their mothers bore them , both to display their valor and their contempt of all enemies . If a prisoner is taken , he is carried back to the city , where in the presence of all the assembly they kill him with swords , which done , they roast and eat him in common ; but this disgusting treatment is reserved for ene-mies they honor , believing that the flesh of a noble foe has a special virtue . All others they set free , disdaining to partake of their meat . In time of peace the Caribs waste much of their day in dancing and other sports , one of their favorites being a species of racing with heavy logs , the manner of which is this . Two companies are formed , consisting perhaps of a dozen men apiece , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ log weighing above fifteen stone . One man from each company shoulders this burden , running with it the length of two musket shots , whereupon it passes to the shoulders of the next man , and so on from man to man until in this manner they complete the course , which may be as long as ten miles . And thus by the combined efforts of many a great weight is borne a great distance . The winning company is accorded much honor that evening when songs are sung in its praise , but if any man shall have let fall the log while it was his turn to bear it , he is made the object of general derision . 28 GOLDING 'S TALE  | We tarried for several days amongst this nation , during which time Captain Keymis held much conference with their king both about the mine and about Raleigh , for William held the Admiral in such estimation as he would hear not once but many times over everything that had befallen him since last they met . But when he learned that all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereign 's disfavor and by no fault of his own , and that this was the cause that for so long he had not returned to Guiana , then the king wept the most compassionate tears that were ever seen , saying he did not understand how any monarch could be so foolish to treat such a man in such a fashion . Moreover , for Raleigh 's sake , he used Wat with the greatest honor possible , even preparing food for him with his own hands . As his own father had done before him , the king gave us to be our guide his eldest son , whom we christened Martin , a young savage who he assured us was familiar with all those parts in which we desired to travel . And indeed a guide was a most necessary convenience to us , for lacking one it would have been near impossible ever to reach the main current of the river . The stream upon which we had heretofore sailed was little more than a branch or tributary river , the main course of the Orinoco not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small MARK ROSE 29  | channels that wind and cross , forming a great delta or labyrinth of streams , many of them no more than a few hundred feet in breadth . So many islands , channels , courses , streams , rivers , and branches are there , and all so like one another , that no man can tell which to take , and every island so bordered with high trees that no man can see farther than the present breadth of the stream or length of the breach . Unto this part of our journey were we come , where we had no shift but to entrust our entire navigation to this savage , who performed the office with such cunning that he was the marvel of us all . Martin showed us , as we sailed , the best places for fishing and also taught us to catch the giant tortoise that abounds in those waters , the flesh of which , either roasted , boiled , or fried , is extremely succulent and of sufficient quantity that but one of these creatures will provide a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , we took a great number with our fowling pieces , firing from the hatches . So that what with the birds , the tortoises , and the fish , together with the victuals we procured at the city , our diet was at this time truly excellent both for quantity and variety , and the men had no complaint of their food . In these waters we frequently observed , resting beneath the shady vegetation of the bank , a species of very large crocodile , called by Martin caymanos , which he informed us are great eaters 30 GOLDING 'S TALE  | of flesh . Moreover , there dwell here a kind of eels that , swimming in companies of two or three score , are able so to sting a man that he will lose his senses and drown , whereupon they bear him to their nests and feed him to their young . Here are also in certain streams a lusty fish , called by the Spanish piranha , which travel in very great numbers together , and any flesh that comes in their course they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will continue to eat until their bellies burst and they die , which folly of theirs Martin demonstrated by hanging over the side a fat half of pork that had begun to rot and was no longer fit , and indeed the fishes did as he said , which was horrible to behold . But the general richness of the country gave us good hope for the richness of the mine , as it is commonly seen that countries are either rich or barren altogether , and if a land possess one good thing in abundance , it is like to possess others as well . About this time , the mariners , their greed quickened by the prospects of success , began to play at stakes for each other 's shares , so that one might generally find upon the hatches a circle of men gathered about a pair of dice , each thinking in this fashion to thrive at the expense of the others . Upon one occasion , an old fisherman , having evidently won all or a great part of the shares of several of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the which he did deny , this MARK ROSE 31  | old man they knocked upon the head with a spar and threw into the water , where he would past question have drowned had not the sudden dousing restored his wits , so that he rose to the surface thrashing and kicking . Yet the violence of his motions attracted to him one of the caymanos floating in the shallows by the bank , and , seeing this creature hasting upon him , his jaws all open and huge , the old man cried out in terror even as he struggled to reach Keymis 's pinnace . Hearing this cry , Martin , who was then upon the poop , thrust a knife betwixt his teeth and leapt into the water , all naked as he was . But the fisherman 's companions had now procured muskets and commenced firing , some at the beast , but others at the old man , judging this a ready and easy way for the canceling of their debts . Wherefore Martin , upon reaching him , found him already a corpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice or thrice hit , turned upon Martin , who suddenly disappeared underwater , and the next moment the water became all bloody , which we conceived to be the savage 's end ; and yet we were mistaken , for presently the crocodile rolled upon his back and Martin rose grinning , having slipped beneath the creature and plunged his knife into its belly . Now he took hold of the corpse and swam with it to the ship , where he was received with cheers from the men ; and indeed he was pleased with himself , having dem-a  | onstrated his boldness and skill , wherefore he hauled the old man 's corpse onto the hatches like some trophy he had won . The corpse itself was later that day sewn in sailcloth , weighted with balls , and tossed back into the river . As for those who had fired their muskets , they were haled before Keymis and accused of deliberately firing to kill the old man , which they naturally denied , expressing the greatest grief at his loss , and there the matter lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us who did not know the truth was otherwise and not as they said . On the fifth day after leaving the savage city , we emerged from the delta and entered upon the main channel of the Orinoco , and the river was at this point no less than four leagues in breadth , with the current exceeding strong and swift against us ; yet , the breezes keeping fair , we advanced in the next six days some ninety leagues . On the seventh day , however , we found ourselves in a place where the channel narrowed to less than half its normal breadth , with rugged hills rising from the river on either side , and the channel itself littered with a great many islands , both large and small , which further constricted it , so that the current flowed very fast with a great frothing and roaring as the waters strained against the banks . We struck all but the mainsail , and with the men at the oars made reasonable way against the current , resting in the lee of each  | of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well but that , casting off from the third island , we encountered an untoward current from the starboard , which , swinging us hard about with extreme suddenness , the men were unable to pull the bows forward , and the current swept us helpless back at the island , where , veering abruptly as it approached , it deposited us upon a mudbank a fair ways offshore . I ordered the depth sounded and learned that we stood in three inches of mud , being stuck upon a species of bar in the middle of the channel . By this time the other ships had progressed beyond the island so there was no way of crying or signaling to them for help , and we had no shift but to heave overboard all our ballast to get her afloat , which was unfortunate as we carried a large part of the provisions of the fleet . This mishap marked the point at which our luck changed , for , emerging from the rapids towards evening , we observed the breezes to dwindle earlier than they were wont to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still that there was no way of proceeding except by oars alone , and this stillness of the air remained with us above two weeks , which was a great let and delay , as in this period we made not so much progress in four days as we had previously done in one . Our victuals , too , were somewhat restricted on account of the store of provisions we had been 34 GOLDING 'S TALE  | constrained to throw overboard to float the barge . This shortage should have been of little account in those fertile regions of the delta , but here above the rapids we found ourselves in a rocky and mountainous country much poorer than the former and less able to furnish us with what we required , which was especially bread and drink and some fresh meat if we could have it , for , whereas of fish we had aplenty , we had by this time little or no bread and less drink , but only the thick and troubled water of the river , which was a great source of the yellow flux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , the current against us every day waxing stronger , so that each day we made less progress than the last , and the weather being extreme hot , with no breezes to refresh us , our companies began to despair and some to swoon with the heat and the thirst . Keymis sought to cheer the men by reminding them that there had never yet been anything great achieved without difficulty , and he recalled to them the troubles of the first voyage to Guiana , dwelling upon the courage and spirit of those adventurers . But the mariners grew restive with being preached at , and they made jest of these moldy tales and maxims , so that Wat Raleigh , angered by their rudeness to his father 's old companion , addressed them such sharp words as effectively recalled them of their duties . And now Wat took counsel with the savage , who revealed  | that there was a town of his nation some two score leagues farther on , and , if we might once reach it , we should procure what we required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three days ' labor to this town , although he knew that against such a current it was more , and he commanded each company to take pains , every gentleman and others taking their turns to row and to spell one another upon the hour . The three days being past , he promised an end the next day , and this deception he repeated several times . And thus the difficulties of the journey continued , and the farther on we went , our victuals decreasing and the air breeding great faintness , we grew weaker and weaker , even then when we had most need of strength and ability , for hourly the river ran more violently against us.  | We reached the savage town around nightfall on the sixth day of our labor , and from the river it presented an extraordinary sight , for the entire city was surrounded by a ring of small fires , with a great many other fires burning within the ring as well , so that the whole region shone with a strange radiance , the very trees exuding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known it was a city of Caribs , we might have thought ourselves come upon some ghostly convocation , and we marveled the more because at the former city we had seen nothing of the kind . Moreover , even from the river we could hear a species of music , very stately and grave , but nothing like our English music , being produced , as we later discov- ered , upon no other instruments but the hollow trunks of trees . These strange things wrought a marvelous degree of fearfulness among our men , the more reasonable of whom believed we had discovered a savage nation at war , but the greatest part convinced that our savage guide , being a pagan and worshiper of devils , had brought us to a gathering of fiends , whence we would be carried off to unspeakable torments . Martin behaved most strangely at this time , for no sooner did he apprehend the music than he fell upon the hatches and commenced pounding his thighs with his fists , and , after continuing in this fashion for some space , whilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wits , he suddenly produced his knife with which , turning the point upon himself , he made three short strokes upon the left side of his face and one long stroke along . the back of his right arm , from which cuts or rather deep scratches the blood rose in drops . Nor would he speak to us , nor afterwards say what business he was about , except to explain that he must go ashore , promising to return as soon as he might . Keymis wondered both at the savage 's behavior and the appearance of the city , protesting that he had never seen the like . Moreover , the men being apprehensive , to occupy them and perhaps to calm their fears , he ordered the cannoneers to charge and load their ordnance , both  | the greater pieces and the less . It could not have been above an hour that the savage remained ashore , and yet it seemed many times longer , all this while the strange music continuing and the fires waxing brighter as if fed with more fuel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Martin in it , who being taken aboard explained the reason for all these mysteries , which was that the king of this city had recently died , the whole town being even now in mourning for him , so that what we saw were the trappings of their grief . At first the priests and cassiques of the city were reluctant for us to visit them at such a time , for the funerals of their kings are amongst the most holy of their celebrations ; but Martin described to them both our extreme need and the honor in which his father the king held us , he being a very great man amongst the entire nation , wherefore they at last expressed themselves content that we should observe their ceremonies , after which they would undertake to satisfy our wants . Keymis judged it unwise for us to go ashore at this time , saying that it would be well enough to wait until the celebrations ended , but Martin said the savages would conceive it as a shame and dishonor to themselves if we spurned their courtesy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and myself , together with about a score of mariners , would attend these funerals ,  | whilst Griffiths remained in command of the rest upon the ships , and this arrangement , Martin said , would satisfy the savages . The mariners , however , did not like this plan , both because so few were to go ashore and because Keymis insisted that we must go weaponless , leaving behind both swords and pistols , for they conceived that Martin intended to betray us and they did not trust him as he was a savage . Moreover , even the bravest were superstitiously fearful about visiting a savage city by night , supposing there must be fiends and devils in those places after dark , and thus we found ourselves constrained to choose the landing party by lots . We rowed ashore in four boats , being met upon the strand by the six cassiques , or sons of the late king . These cassiques , each of whom bore a flaming brand , had painted their bodies all red for the ceremonies , besides which they wore in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they appeared to be horns , wherefore the mariners made a great cry , thinking that indeed their fears had been correct and they were being delivered over to fiends , and some among them commenced to pray and cross themselves until , reaching the strand , they might see that these were but men . Keymis informed the cassiques of our sorrow for their father 's death , thanking them for their great courtesy to us , and they replied each in  | turn very gravely but in their savage tongue so that I did not understand what they said . I noted , however , that they possessed upon their cheeks and arms the same species of scratches that we had seen Martin make , and this is evidently their mark of grief . The cassiques conducted us through a town both in size and disposition of buildings very like the former , except that here all was ordered for the purpose of the funeral . Before the door of each house a fire burned , and above the door hung certain of their signs of mourning such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , we were told , would be cast into the fires when the celebrations ended . But the fearful men advanced with great caution , imagining that behind each building might lie an ambush that the savages had set . We were brought at last to their council place , which is a large square in the center of the city before the king 's house , and here were gathered all the people , perhaps seven or eight hundred together , both men and women , many of the latter with infants at their breasts . It was a marvel to behold the solemnity with which these savages received us , for they hardly stirred as the cassiques led us in . A number of the infants , however , commenced to bawl aloud as if frightened by our strange appearance , and this was a comforting and familiar sound , for I am certain 42 1 GOLDING 'S TALE  | I could not distinguish betwixt the cries of these and our own English children . The cassiques settled us in a place of respect near where the musicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more fervor than before , if it were possible , for the greater honor to ourselves and their late king . And now their ceremonies continued , which consisted at this point of dances , a circle of men , painted red like the cassiques , proceeding in an intricate yet solemn step about the central fire . Meanwhile , the spectators of this dance devoted themselves to drinking and eating , and especially the former , as these savages are great drinkers and one of the chief parts of their ceremonies of all kinds is for the entire city to become sotted together , although , strange to say , the more they drink the graver they become , which is not the same with us . Bowls of their liquor passed amongst us , and at first the men refused to touch them , fearing they might be poisoned , for they were still uneasy , waiting for the moment when we should be set upon and slain and perhaps eaten as part of the feast . But , seeing the savages drink from the same bowls , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it good , after which the rest gave themselves to it so greedily that Keymis became alarmed , for this beverage is more potent than beer or wine . I myself , having MARK ROSE 43  | been told the manner of the liquor 's brewing , did not drink it , and if the men had known as much , they too would have been more restrained . This is how it is made : several days before the feast all the women of the city , and especially those who are most young and fair , gather in circles about large earthenware pots . Rinsing their mouths with a sip of water , they take , each into her own mouth , a piece of cassava bread that has been specially prepared , and chewing upon this a certain moisture collects in the mouth , which is then spat into the pot . The pot being full , it is first boiled and then set aside to ferment , which very quickly happens in that climate , so that by the time of the feast the liquor is ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spittle maintains them in good health , and indeed we did not see a sick body amongst them , nor any that were toothless or palsied or crooked with age , but whether this be from the effects of the potion or no I can not say . The dance continued a considerable time , being followed by other ceremonies of divers kinds , including an address made by each of the cassiques , and this was wearisome to me as I did not understand the tongue , although it sounded very like Welsh . When this was done , an old man stood before the fire , and his body was all white with ashes except his face and arms , which 44 GOLDING 'S TALE  | were painted bright blue where he was tattooed . Evidently he was a priest of some kind , for he made signs to the company as if he were blessing them , and then he blessed our men as well , after which he grasped a fistful of dirt in each hand and smeared this upon his face and body , whereupon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heap as if dead . Here the musicians ceased their playing , and presently the priest began to moan and writhe upon the ground , and these motions becoming ever more violent , he rose to his knees and at last to his feet , all this time twisting and turning his body in the most violent fashion imaginable . And now it was apparent that his motions were in some kind a dance , and furthermore his moaning had become a kind of chant , and thus , dancing and chanting , he ran around and around the fire in the middle of the crowd . The cassiques stepped forth now , solemnly bearing wooden bowls that they placed upon the ground in a circle around the fire , the priest dancing in and out amongst these dishes . After a space the cassiques raised the bowls for the spectators to view and we might see that they contained a kind of shredded meat . Each proceeded next to eat a portion from the dish he carried , the priest making the circuit of the entire fire and plucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken their fill , the bowls MARK ROSE 45  | were passed among the remaining savages , each of whom removed a morsel , every man and woman eating of this meat and the mothers feeding a portion to their infants as well , which was one of the most loathsome sights I have ever beheld . The cassiques now carried the bowls to our company , and , lest we offend them , Keymis indicated we must make a show of tasting . The bowl coming to me , I therefore took one of the greasy strips between my fingers , but as soon as possible I buried it in the earth at my side . Several of the mariners , however , their curiosity whetted by the quantity they had drunk and desiring moreover to show how far they had conquered their fears , did eat the flesh , and this they considered a great adventure , later boasting to their companions of what they had done . At this time , as part of their ceremonies , some two dozen painted savages leapt into the space before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were evidently about to perform a dance or some other rite . But our fearful mariners , beholding this , supposed the moment of treachery had come , wherefore several began to cry out for us to flee and save ourselves before we were lost . Keymis and Wat , very angry , commanded those that were shouting to be quiet , but already most were upon their feet and some had begun to run for the boats . The savages , not un 46 GOLDING 'S TALE  | derstanding the mariners ' error , were in great confusion , and those with the spears stepped from the ring to consult with the cassiques . The cassiques , however , had hurried to Martin to discover what our men were about , wherefore now the spearmen came towards us , and , seeing these approaching , looking exceedingly fierce withal , more of the men fled , and all was thus most disorderly on account of the drunkenness and cowardice of those men . At last Keymis and Wat managed to reduce the remaining men to reason , showing them that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained to the cassiques the folly of our men , assuring them that no dishonor was intended . But these unwonted disorders having occurred , Keymis judged it best that we should return to the vessels , and on any account the ceremonies were almost concluded . We departed therefore for the boats , Keymis and Wat discussing by the way what punishment should be provided for those who had fled . Two boats remained upon the strand and in these we set out for the ships . And here occurred a most unfortunate thing , for those who fled had reported to Griffiths that the funeral had been a snare into which Martin betrayed us , and , their fantasies bodying forth their apprehensions , they described in such a manner that even Griffiths believed it was so , how the Caribs sought to poiMARK ROSE 47  | son us and , that failing , set upon us with spears in a bloody battle in which all but themselves were slain . Hearing this , Griffiths concluded that the surest mean to preserve the pinnaces themselves from attack was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to fire even as we left the strand , the balls flying above our heads and crashing amongst the buildings to the rear . We rowed as hard as we might , crying all the while for them to cease their assault , but at first they thought us savages , believing all the others were dead , and when at last they perceived who we were , the balls in striking the many fires within the city had so scattered the flames that the whole savage town was burning . We hurried aboard the ships , Keymis and Wat very wroth and demanding to know how such a thing had occurred . But before any explanation could be given , we observed the savages preparing canoes all along the strand and it was plain that now they intended to attack us in earnest , even as the men had feared . But Keymis refused to fight , saying we had done them enough ill as it was : instead he ordered that we raise anchor and depart , which we very hastily did , being fortunate in having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the savage town in flames behind us . When Keymis and Wat heard from Griffiths the reason for the cannonade , they ordered those 48 GOLDING 'S TALE  | men who had fled and reported our deaths to be bound to the masts at midday and whipped for their mischief until all their flesh was raw . This was performed the next day , and yet even then the mariners swore they had seen the savages slaying us with spears and would not admit that they had lied to Griffiths . At this time our guide Martin became in effect our prisoner , for seeing the town afire and conceiving it was himself that had brought this affliction upon his people , he was determined to surrender himself to those savages to be killed or otherwise used as they desired . Now Martin being so needful to us as a guide , we might not allow him his will in this matter , wherefore we were constrained to shut him in the cabin of Keymis 's pinnace to prevent his leaping overboard . For two days this savage youth refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , set as it seemed upon a course of starvation . But at last , the extreme fit of passion passing , he consented to speak with Wat , who told him that he must not hold either us or himself so strictly to account for this mishap , and to cheer him Wat described how those mariners had been whipped for their lies . Martin replied that this was not sufficient , for to show our grief , we must suffer an equal loss as the city we had destroyed , which might only be accomplished  | through the purposeful burning of our pinnaces in the sight of those we had offended . Wat attempted to explain how impossible this was , asking Martin to set some less rigorous manner to display our sorrow , but the savage said there was no other way . Perhaps Wat would have allowed the matter to rest there except that we were now more than ever in need of provisions , having received no relief at all from the savage town . Therefore he made the savage a personal entreaty , recalling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father and Martin 's nation . Moreover , he pledged that when we discovered the gold we would procure for the people of that city we had burned whatever they might require to make their lives more easeful , as muskets and swords for defense , and in this way we should make our amends , whereby Martin might see that so far from being the betrayer of his people , he would do them much good . Whether Wat intended to fulfill these promises I can not say , for surely it would have been unwise to arm a nation of cannibals with guns , but he so far prevailed with Martin that the savage consented at least to assist us in the finding of provisions for the present . Emerging from the cabin , Martin studied our location and then revealed there was a region nearby where we might procure great quantities of a pleasant and 50 GOLDING 'S TALE  | wholesome fruit , greatly esteemed among his people , and this fruit , he said , would keep many weeks even in the most extreme heat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might provide for our needs in some other way . To gather these fruits we had to sail about a league upon a branch of the river too shallow at this dry time of the year to admit the pinnaces , and so for this expedition we employed my company and the barge , Wat and Martin coming aboard to discover the way . We set out the following morning , rowing upon the branch , which was little more than a fathom in depth , and , having gone about one league , the savage bade us secure the vessel and disembark , for the remainder of the journey must be accomplished on foot . Upon either side lay dense forests , extending even to the water , and no path or entrance to be seen , so that we marveled that Martin could tell this place from any other , as to us they all appeared the same . Nevertheless , he assured us that he knew very well where we were , having been to this region twice before with his people . The wood grew so dense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung like serpents from the boughs , that we were compelled to hack our way with swords as we went . Inside the forest the air became close and putrid and the light very thick , so that in places we might MARK ROSE 51  | barely distinguish one tree from another . Moreover , it stank of rot and several times we observed scorpions , spiders , and other noxious creatures of that sort , which Martin told us to avoid , saying that if we harmed them not , they would not meddle with us . We continued in this fashion for more than an hour , in which time I became exceedingly uneasy , fearing that perhaps the savage was conducting us to another town of his nation where we would be assaulted . I considered , however , that we were a large party and well armed , and furthermore that it is never the manner of these savages to dwell inland but always upon the bank of some river , and thus I quieted my fears . We went on about another quarter of an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small but very beautiful lake , the waters of which were black and marvelously still , shining like onyx or black pearl . The lake itself was almost perfectly round , which was very strange to behold , with all about it growing a kind of trees not unlike lemon trees but much smoother in the branch and taller in growth , and these branches were hung with a wonderful fruit , round like an orange but exceedingly glossy , some of them deep purple and others of a color betwixt murrey and scarlet , very tempting and luscious to the eye . I wondered that in the midst of so unruly a region such great beauty could be found and that 52 GOLDING 'S TALE  | the savage had known of this place to bring us here . Martin encouraged us to make haste , for this lake was a favorite resort of their jaguars , a very fierce beast they have in that country that is somewhat like our leopard but more terrible . We rapidly as we might , making in several hours so fine a harvest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . This food we collected in great baskets woven of palm trees and carried slung upon our backs , each man transporting in this manner perhaps fifty or more fruits . The return to the river was thus fairly laborious except we had the advantage of being able to follow the same trail we had earlier cut through the vines . We reached the river in the late afternoon , very weary and hot , and yet pleased that we had succeeded so well in providing for our companies . Before commencing to load our baskets into the barge , we rested for a moment upon the strand . A number of the men , being hungry , proposed to try the virtues of the fruit , although Martin advised that they should wait until we returned to the pinnaces , which I thought wise on account of the lateness of the day and the sunset coming so suddenly in those parts that there was , I conceived , some danger of finding ourMARK ROSE 53 1  | selves cut off by the darkness from our companions and constrained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , however , insisted and began to peel the rind or skin from several of the fruits , both of the purple and the murrey kinds , discovering within a very juicy , brownish pulp , which they pronounced somewhat bitter but refreshing and in its way exceedingly pleasant . I had just begun peeling a fruit for myself when one of the men who had eaten most greedily fell upon the ground and , uttering neither word nor cry , nor showing the signs of any convulsion or tremor , suddenly and silently died . He was followed in a moment or two by another who , as abruptly and in as strange a fashion , expired . And now with horror I regarded the brown pulp in my hands , and , casting this as far from me as I could , I hurried to the water 's edge , where I gave my fingers a very great scrubbing . I returned to find a third man sprawled upon the ground and half a dozen others , who had tasted of the fruit , kneeling in prayer with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew they were dead , and indeed they were , all six of them presently dying with their prayers on their lips . In the tumult and confusion of these events , Martin might easily have fled into the forest to preserve himself from our wrath , but , strange to  | say , he had not moved from where he gravely squatted next to the basket of fruits . Three mariners leapt upon him with their swords drawn and would have dispatched him if Wat had not come between them , seizing him by the shoulders and demanding of him again and again why he had done this thing . But although Wat recalled to him the personal trust between them and the old friendship of their fathers and many other matters of a similar nature , nevertheless the savage held his tongue , until at last in a great rage Wat threw him to the ground and , wrenching back the head , cut his throat with his sword , the blood like a fountain flowing over his breast . And thus he died , as much by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fled or at least spoken , Wat perhaps would have spared him . Now Wat sat upon the ground with the bloody corpse of the savage in his lap , but when he saw all about him the bodies of those who had been poisoned through Martin 's cunning , he thrust the savage aside and , deeply grieving , took account of each man that had died . Moreover he blamed himself alone for this misfortune , saying that if he had not trusted the savage it would not have been . And then he commanded that all the fruits be placed in a heap and burned , but this was done only with great difficulty , for on account of the moisture within them , they would not catch fire , and when at last  | they did , the smell was very foul like that of burning flesh . Meanwhile , the bodies of those who died we buried in the mud next to the river , and there was no mark or sign upon them that they had been poisoned except a certain purplish inward stain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the savage 's body where it lay , consigning it to be devoured by the birds and wild beasts , but Wat commanded that this body was to be buried as well , for in his fashion , he said , Martin had acted with honor . We reached the main channel of the river just as darkness was falling , and about an hour later espied the lanterns of the pinnaces where they were anchored for the night . When Keymis heard these misfortunes that had befallen us , he was appalled and dismayed , but not so much on account of the deaths of the men as by the loss of the savage , for Martin 's help had been necessary , he said , to the finding of the mine . But now he would have to discover it by himself , although he had not visited the place in twenty years , and he complained once again that it was upon him that this had fallen , saying that the Admiral ought never to have yielded to the mariners ' demands as he did .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only short of provisions but without any guide . About two hours before sunset upon the sixth day following the treachery of the savage , we reached the confluence of the Orinoco and Caroni rivers , which being sighted the men cheered and Keymis ordered several pieces to be fired in celebration as we were now entering upon the region of the gold . The running together of two such mighty streams as these is an awesome sight , for at this point the Orinoco is perhaps two leagues in breadth and the Caroni not much less , and the swiftness of the currents conjoining produces an extreme turbulence and disruption of the waters ,  | the flow very wanton and dangerous , shifting from point to point as one or the other stream predominates , so that it is no easy task in a pinnace or barge to escape being spun about and hurled downstream . Accordingly , we anchored for the night somewhat below the confluence that we might perform the navigation of it in the freshness of the morning , and all that night we heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with oars and sails , we attempted this hazard and accomplished it without mishap to any of the vessels , the men laboring with an excellent will , being as they thought very near to the mine and the rewarding of their pains . And now we found ourselves in a harsh and stony country , the land very brown , being strewn with great boulders like the ruins of a city , and the sun burning upon them with such violence that it made the fiery earth to shimmer in our eyes , seeming no substantial land at all but mere illusion and charm . As we proceeded there grew upon either bank first hills and presently mountains , rising higher and higher until they loomed like towers above us and the river was become a kind of shaded gorge or flume . Scanning these peaks , the men saw or believed they saw veins of gold glittering all open to common view , and these were most apparent , they maintained , in the early morning when the rays of the sun first struck the slopes .  | But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they described , although I stood watch in the morning and at all the best times . Nevertheless , the mariners were almost beside themselves with expectation , and each convinced the other that the veins were really there and that all these mountains were nothing but one heap of massy gold lightly covered with soil . This talk of streaks and veins and mountains of gold angered Keymis , who said that he and Raleigh had crawled upon every stone of this place and found nothing but a trifle of marquisite , which is worthless although by the ignorant it may be taken for gold . The true mine might be recognized by a mountain with three bare peaks upon the south bank , and this , as he judged , was still some ten or twenty leagues upriver . So persistent were the men , however , insisting that they saw the gold with their own eyes , that Wat Raleigh believed they might turn mutinous if we did not permit them to go ashore and satisfy themselves ; wherefore , opening his mind to Keymis , he persuaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Keymis disdainfully consented and to show his scorn proclaimed that any man who discovered gold might keep for himself all that he found . In the morning the men scrambled into the  | boats , and some who did not succeed in gaining places among the first to be ferried ashore even ventured to swim , they were so anxious to get to land , but Keymis , Wat , Griffiths , and myself remained upon our vessels , together with those few who were less foolish or greedy than the rest . The mariners were ashore all day and , even as God from the great throne in Heaven looks down upon the works and follies of men , so we might from the fleet behold the hungry madness of these , appearing very small as they crept upon the face of the mountain . Toward evening they returned in groups , weary , cut , and bruised , their fingers blistered from pulling themselves over the stones , and most of them chastened , for , as Keymis prophesied , they found no gold , and he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave to him to determine where to search . Upon this occasion one difficulty arose : by morning there were yet two men who had not returned to the fleet , and Keymis was for leaving them , saying it was their own folly that led them ashore , wherefore they were no concern of ours ; but Wat , being reluctant to punish them so severely , so far prevailed that for half the day we lay idle whilst he led a party to land , and in this time we fired our pieces into the air as a signal in case those men should hear it . One of the men Wat discovered , very faint , lying upon the  | strand , but the second he neither saw nor heard , and whether he was dead or injured or still searching for gold we never learned . That afternoon Keymis addressed the mariners , describing the mountain with three peaks , and he offered to the first man to spy this mountain three gold crowns , which he displayed and tied in a purse . And so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more sober now on account of the one who had been lost , and everyone on the watch for this landmark , conceiving that we had but to discover it and fortune would easily follow . The next day in the first hour of the morning I heard a great cry go up amongst my men and John Williams , my old lieutenant , came running to tell me Keymis 's mountain was in view . It was Williams himself who had spied it , and of this I could not be more pleased , for of all my company he most deserved to be rewarded . We ascended from my cabin and Williams showed me where the mountain lay about two leagues off , very clearly displaying its three peaks and all of them bare just as Keymis had said . I ordered a demi-culverin fired , which was our sign that the mountain was found , and all the men cheered . We reached the mountain later that morning , anchoring in its shadow , and now we might see that the peaks were not bald as they appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrub so that I supposed there might be some question whether this were truly the landmark mountain or no . But Keymis said doubtless the scrub was due to the lateness of the season , for it had been much earlier in the year when he first visited this place ; moreover , in twenty years even a mountain might change somewhat and grow richer or poorer just as a man , and indeed this seemed most probable . To discover the mine Keymis chose a party of six men , including Williams as he was the first to sight the mountain , and they departed the following morning at dawn . Exactly what occurred upon this misfortunate expedition and whether there was truly a mine in that place or no I can not say of a certainty , for , not having seen it with my own eyes , I know no more than Williams told me , but that much I shall report . From the very first , Williams said , Keymis behaved in an odd fashion , for so far from being pleased to be at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melancholy and choleric by turns , either sullen as a condemned man or distemperately bitter , finding fault with everything the mariners did , whether it was the manner in which they rowed the jolly boat ashore or the haste with which they climbed the mountain . As for the mine itself , when the men plied him with questions , as was most natural they should do ,  | asking whether it would be difficult to refine and how great a distance to carry the ore to the vessels , these reasonable queries he refused to answer at all , saying they would know soon enough the great richness of Raleigh 's mine . And when they again pressed him upon these points , he became angry , declaring that their greed sickened him and he would tell them no more ; but he had told them nothing in any case , Williams said . The first day he led them to the top of the mountain , and this was , according to Williams , a most arduous and painful ascent with many passages where they might not advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bodies were so bruised that they many times begged Keymis to allow them a rest , which he would not by any means do except in certain places where he wished to examine the stones . When at last they reached the summit , they were all sweated and shivering , for although the sun was very hot the breezes were chill , but now Keymis permitted them to throw themselves upon the ground to rest and afterwards to eat , which they had not done since they left the ships , being in consequence quite faint . Looking out , they could see in every direction a great distance , the river appearing a purple gash in the land and the ships so small they could barely make out the masts ; but when they turned  | inland , there were only mountains as far as they could see . They made their camp among the stones on the inland slope of the mountain , but the ground being so rough and the air so cold once the sun had set , and the winds blowing all night besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they lay down . This day , which was exceedingly hot even for that country , they descended partway down the mountain upon its back side , going very slow as Keymis would stop every ten or fifteen feet to peer at the stones , and he was if anything even more ill-tempered than the previous day , until at last in the afternoon when they were too weary to proceed any farther and had sat down to eat some of their provisions , he opened his mind to them . Twenty years before , Keymis said , he and Raleigh being brought to this place by their savage guide , every stone they turned had glittered and not with marquisite but with such traces as are the witnesses of the finest gold , so that testing the veins they found them to be gold indeed and all this slope a kind of natural treasure house or royal hoard of the Guianas , worth as they judged more than any other mine on earth . But now he could find none of these stones , nor could he discover either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call madre del oro , both of which they had seen in such quanti-  | ties that it was a marvel to behold . Now it could not be that so many stones had disappeared , nor did he believe he was mistaken in the place , wherefore he must conclude that his eyes were deceiving him and the stones still grew where they had . Did he not have a map , Williams asked , to be certain of the location ? To which Keymis replied that Raleigh and he had long ago destroyed their maps lest they fall into strangers ' hands , but so often had they made the journey in their minds that they knew every foot of this region . Keymis described to Williams and the others the white spar and the madre del oro and the following day , which was the third since they left the ships , they scattered upon the mountainside to seek these stones . This day being even hotter than the previous and the men laboring hard in their search , they had by late afternoon exhausted the water bottles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping for a drink from another 's bottle , but there was none to be had in the entire party . They had trusted to procure water from the streams upon the mountain , which Keymis said were very plentiful , but these , on account of the lateness of the season , had dried up long before and now were mere ditches of rock and sand . And yet this much fortune befell them that day , that two of the men found  | quantities , albeit small , of the white spar , samples of which they carried back to Keymis , who was , Williams said , almost beside himself with joy . Keymis put it to them now the question what to do , for their water was entirely gone and the victuals almost the same , and they were all sore and weary besides , with their garments even then very torn from the briars and stones . They might return to the vessels , he said , and refresh themselves and restore their provisions , which would mean a waste of several days , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the land . As for himself , Keymis said , he believed they should continue , for now they had found the white spar they were certain of success , and , aching as they were , the men agreed with him . The next day they made a spare breakfast of biscuit without any water to ease their thirst and then descended farther along the slope , finding somewhat more of the spar as they went . Their thirst however became more extreme all morning , for each time they discovered a rill or stream it was dry ; and now , Williams said , he felt faint from the heat and lack of water , and all the others the same , wherefore it was decided that if they did not come upon water before evening they must turn back or else they might perish in that place . They had not gone more than a mile farther ,  | being now upon relatively level ground , when suddenly they saw before them a pond so completely covered with birds that at first it looked like dry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the birds , first in one place , then in another , and finally all at once , rose into the air with a great beating of wings , and there were in this cloud of fowl divers kinds of ducks , herons , curlews , ibises , gannets , and geese , and all of them good to eat , wherefore even before drinking they fired upon these birds and felled so many in a few moments that they had no want of meat for many days later . When they had drunk their fill and splashed water upon their arms and faces , not daring to bathe on account of the serpents dwelling in the pond , then Keymis bade them fall upon their knees and give thanks to God for providing them with water and food at once , for he said it was a miracle and a clear sign from Providence that if they persevered they would find the mine . That night they passed on the shore of the pond and the following day returned to the mountain , climbing somewhat to the east of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridge when they found before them a stream bed all of stones and every stone shining as if it had been a jewel in a lady 's gown , and if this stream had been truly gold , it had been worth many thousand pounds . Leaping into the channel , the men plucked the  | stones from the ground , and there was not one among them who did not believe that this was indeed the mine , for even Will Stevenson , who was trained as a refiner and assayer , conceived it was veritable gold . Keymis alone was less hasty , for he recalled no such stream , and beating one of the stones upon the other , he loosed sufficient of the glittering mineral to demonstrate it was marquisite and not gold , for it shed from the stone in flakes and crumbled , which gold will not do . For the next two days they searched farther upon those eastern slopes , where twice more they found marquisite although not so abundant as that of the stream and also certain deposits of the white spar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight days and were all exceedingly weary and withered from the sun and their garments hardly of any worth any longer to protect them either from the heat of the day or the cold of the night , and Keymis had become ill-tempered again , driving the men about the mountain in a kind of bitter despair , for he could not conceive why they had not found the mine if it was there , and he knew it was there because he had seen it with his own eyes . Moreover , there was this thought that plagued him : he imagined that the men supposed there was in fact no mine at all and that he and Raleigh had taken marquisite for gold , and thus it angered him when anything was spoken in quiet or out of his hearing ; but the men ,  | Williams said , were not mocking him as Keymis conceived , for they had by now seen sufficient of the white spar to believe there was truly gold to be found . Upon the morning of the ninth day , Stevenson , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first they judged it to be no more than an ague , the consequences of sleeping every night in the open , by evening he was suffering spells of sweating such that it became evident his illness was no chill but that same mortal fever that had afflicted the fleet at sea . To ease the fever 's rage Keymis bled him a little and gave him to drink , holding the cup with his own hands as the man was already too weak to grasp it himself . Stevenson desired to be carried back to the pinnaces , but this Keymis would by no means allow . The following day they made for the invalid a kind of hammock or litter from a blanket and a pair of sticks , and thus they bore him along with great difficulty to themselves and discomfort to him . They had by now explored the whole eastern slope without success , wherefore Keymis decided the mine must lie upon the west although that was not where he remembered it to be . Before proceeding there , however , it was necessary for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and meat , and as they went they continued to examine the stones , Keymis from time to time taking pieces of these to Stevenson in his litter to  | inquire of him his opinion on them . They reached the pond and the next day traveled along the base of the mountain , much hindered by the necessity of carrying Stevenson , which made the journey very slow and laborious . Moreover , the refiner 's fever grew hourly worse and neither bleeding nor water procured him any relief , but he would lie moaning in the litter , his face purple and swollen except when the sweating spells were upon him when he would become all white and the water drained from him as from a sponge . In the morning they commenced the ascent of the western face , which was so steep in places that they had to lash Stevenson to the litter lest he fall off , and four men together were hardly sufficient to carry him upon some of the rocks . This day the refiner fell into a trance , his eyes open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , and perhaps even then he was beholding Christ in His glory , for it is well known that the dying are sometimes delivered to the rewards of Heaven even before they have parted from the flesh . Stevenson died that evening and they buried him upon the mountain , making a cross of the sticks that had formed his litter and planting this upon the stony grave . But the blanket in which they bore him they burned , conceiving there was unhealthiness in it , for each of them dreaded that he should be afflicted next , and indeed their fears  | were justified as afterwards appeared although not for many days . Williams said that he and the other men now wished to return to the vessels , but Keymis was determined to inspect the third slope , being certain now that the mine lay there , for , as he climbed , he said , the region looked more and more familiar and he vowed that when light came he would be able to lead them directly to the place . As for the mariners ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust to Providence upon that as upon all else , for they were no less likely to be stricken on the vessels as there . But , for himself , he said , if they failed to discover the mine , he would sooner rot upon this same mountain than return to tell the Admiral . That night , Williams said , he was awakened by unusual sounds near where he slept , and thinking there must be savages or wild beasts about , he seized his sword , but then , coming fully awake , he marveled to hear that the sounds were a kind of mumbling in Latin , and he rose from his blanket to discover Keymis huddled over something on the ground . Curious and somewhat alarmed , Williams made his way toward him , but stumbled upon a rock , whereupon Keymis looked up with a start , and seeing who it was , motioned him to come and remain quiet . Reaching him , Williams perceived on the ground a strange tangle of vines and five or six  | flames chasing up and down among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground with the end of a stick , always intently following the course of the fire . This continued for perhaps a quarter of an hour , Williams said , and he observed it all in the greatest terror , being certain that Keymis was practicing witchcraft or other forbidden art . But then Keymis stood up and , stamping out the flames with his boot , said they would search upon the farthest western part of the slope , and he reassured Williams that this he had seen was but a species of divination or natural magic , based upon the known affinity between fire and gold , whereby the direction of the burning would reveal the location of the mine . The method had been taught him by the Admiral himself , Keymis said , adding that before he knew Raleigh he had been but an ignorant seaman and all he now understood he owed to the Admiral alone . Williams told me that he returned to his blanket very thoroughly dismayed and certain now that they should never find anything , at least not under Keymis 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold or so it seemed to him . After this they searched the western slope and every other place on that side of the mountain , dragging themselves about as if in a dream , for they no longer knew how many days they had  | been gone nor could they say of a certainty where they had explored and where they had not , all the mountain in their weariness resolving itself into an indistinguishable collection of stones and trees , the earth sometimes deceiving them by appearing to shine even where it was most bare and there was no marquisite or any other cause . So weak and faint were they that even Keymis now agreed they must return to the vessels and refresh themselves , but he made it plain that he was by no means abandoning the search , for it was impossible , he said , that the mine should not be someplace on this mountain and before he lost faith in that he would loose all the men in our fleet to crawl upon the slopes on hands and knees , all three hundred of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus Keymis and his party at last returned to us in the fleet , and when we first saw them , they were so wretched in appearance , their bodies torn from the briars and stones and their garments rags , that they looked little better than beggars or lepers . While Keymis was ashore , Wat Raleigh had decided to explore the river farther on , not with any definite purpose in mind but merely from a curiosity to see what might be there : wherefore , leaving Griffiths and myself to attend Keymis , he sailed some fifteen leagues , examining the country as he went , and he had not gone three  | leagues from where we lay anchored when one of his mariners called him to the hatches to observe that there was another triple-peaked mountain of the kind that held the mine . This mountain , as Wat saw , was indeed marvelously like the other both in shape and majesty , and yet it grew upon the north bank of the river , whereas that other and true one lay upon the south . Proceeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these mountains and this time upon the south bank . Concluding that the evening light must be deceiving their eyes , Wat anchored until dawn , when he saw that the triple peak was in fact an illusion created by the nearness and height of a mountain somewhat behind the one in question . Nevertheless , he said , this was a most peculiar mount , for either upriver or downriver of it one would swear there were three peaks all entirely bare , and only from the front did it reveal its true nature . They sailed another day and a half , and in this space discovered two more mountains that might be said to be triple-peaked as well as several others more difficult to judge , for there were some who maintained they were one thing and some another , and about the bareness , too , there was question . Moreover , when he returned to where Griffiths and myself lay , he saw that Keymis 's mountain was no less doubtful than those others , for approaching it from upriver it ap- peared to possess but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And now Wat was in great confusion , seeing that the country was become a Proteus to us , able to transform itself into any shape it desired , and he did not know whether it was the land or ourselves that were bewitched . By this time Keymis had been gone more than a week and therefore Wat dispatched a party under Griffiths to find him , but the mountain was so huge and being uncertain , besides , whether Keymis was still on it or had ventured inland , Griffiths gave over the search after two days , and thus we had no shift but to wait until Keymis appeared as I have already described . When Keymis heard from Wat of the other mountains he at first despaired , for he asked were they then to climb every peak in Guiana ? Furthermore , if we lingered too long upon the finding of the mine , there would be no time to work it as the winter should have come , which in that country commences in March , bringing with it such torrents of rain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river is impassable by any mortal means . But at last Keymis decided that , seeing as in so many days of searching he had found nothing upon this mountain , the wisest course was at least to consider those that Wat had discovered , hoping that he would be able to learn fairly quickly which was the true one among them .  | Thus we set sail again , proceeding still farther upriver , with Keymis becoming grimmer as each day passed , for every mountain that Wat had spied he investigated , taking ashore larger and larger companies , sometimes as many as two hundred men going upon land at once , and , these being untrained in the signs that reveal gold , it may be that there was in fact ore upon one or another of these peaks and it went unperceived due to the ignorance of the searchers . We explored well beyond the fifteen leagues Wat had sailed , for there were promising mountains farther on as well . Moreover , Keymis decided there was no good reason any longer to pass over what likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these we investigated too , and in all this we spent somewhat better than three weeks . At this time Griffiths confided to me that he did not believe there was any mine at all . Was it not likely , he said , that Raleigh all along rather hoped to discover a mine than knew of one for certain ? Clearly Keymis was but prospecting a region he and Raleigh judged promising . I protested that the Admiral would not stoop to gull us in such a fashion , for if the voyage was no more than a venture he would have said so . Why no , said Griffiths , I must remember that Raleigh had been desperate to be released from prison , and to achieve that and acquire a fleet it had been necessary to give out that the mine was  | certain . It was a bold venture to recover his fortunes , and perhaps it would yet succeed . The more I considered this the more probable it seemed and I became mightily angry seeing I had been gulled and misused ; and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to search and that if the true nature of the voyage came to the men we should all be endangered by their wrath . At the beginning of the third week after Keymis returned from the mountain the feverous infection contracted by Stevenson and carried back to the fleet by the others of that party commenced to spread amongst our companies , revealing itself first in one of the men who had borne Stevenson 's litter and later among others ; and this second fever , perhaps on account of the unhealthy climate of the region , proved more violent even than the one at sea , for very few of those who contracted it upon this occasion recovered . The men by now were become exceedingly unruly , being fearful of the fever and impatient with continual searching and finding nothing when they had been promised so much ; and there were some among them who , having come to the same conclusion as Griffiths and myself , even dared to speak out openly against Raleigh and Keymis , saying the Admiral had cozened them , weaving this tale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison .  | One night three mariners bearing swords entered Keymis 's cabin whilst he slept and , haling him from his bunk , threatened to kill him and take command of the fleet themselves if he did not bring us to the mine within two days . Keymis cried out for help and the three men , being sotted , were quickly seized , but there were others both maddened and witless enough to have done the same if they were sufficiently bold . Indeed the fleet stank of mutiny and to me it seemed only a question of when it would occur .  | Amidst all these difficulties Keymis sternly pressed on , bidding us be of good hope for he would find the mine yet . We had reached about fifty leagues above the confluence of the Orinoco and Caroni rivers and the desperate condition of our companies was as I have described it , when , upon the thirty-sixth day of our searching , much to our surprise , we came upon the town of San Pedro . The town was of a fair size , surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground . Three crenellated wooden towers stood at regular intervals upon the river side of this stockade , and on these towers their ordnance reposed , perhaps six great pieces in all , with the  | middle tower somewhat loftier than the others , and from it flying the colors of the King of Spain . The town lay upon a rise or low hill , backed by a considerable mountain so that she was that way impregnable , and was so disposed that by a few twenty-pounders she commanded the entire breadth of the river . I was astonished to find this town , and so indeed were we all , Keymis saying it certainly had not been so twenty years before . Without question , he said , the Spanish had found Raleigh 's mine and were even now massing his gold within their walls , as why else should a city be builded in such a wilderness ? Seeing this town , white against the green mountain behind it , Wat Raleigh waxed exceedingly gay , crying out that at last we had found fit work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was panting for a fight with the Spanish , for enmity to them ran strong in his blood . As for the jeopardy to his father , Wat declared he could not believe the King would hang a man for returning to England with a fleet laden with gold . It could not be that James valued a Spanish town so far above his own profit and that of his nation that he would wish us now to be idle , having journeyed so far . Nor would the Admiral , if he were here , at all hesitate upon what to do , for such fair ventures were the very food of his life , Wat said , and one did not sail upon a voyage in the first place without being willing to undertake some risk .  | But Keymis paced back and forth wringing his hands , first agreeing with Wat that we must take the town and then concluding that it was impossible , until at last he admitted that he was at war with himself and knew not what to do . When the Spanish fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordering that we make for the strand a little downriver from the town where their cannon might not reach ; and there he set the men to building a camp upon the shore , fortifying it with a ditch , and bringing in the ships as close as might be , both so they should be out of range of the town , and so their ordnance might be a protection to us in the camp . While these works were proceeding , Wat appointed me to go up to San Pedro as an ambassador to speak with the governor , and I must inform him , Wat said , that our intentions were wholly peaceful and inquire of him if by any means he might allow us to pass his town . But my real purpose was to discover the strength of their garrison and if possible to learn how much gold they possessed . This commission I was naturally somewhat loath to undertake , for might not the Spanish prevent my departure once I had entered the town , and indeed I well understood by report how cruelly they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , subjecting them to unspeakable tortures in the name of their Inquisition , and that for no profit neither but for  | mere pleasure and diversion . But Wat assured me it was not their fashion to imprison heralds and ambassadors , saying that whatever else his failings the Spaniard was an honorable enemy . Wherefore , calling to me my lieutenant and bidding him accompany me as an herald , I dressed myself as richly as I might for the better estimation of my country , and thus we set out through the woods , believing that at last we were come to the discovery of the gold . About half a mile from San Pedro , we encountered a party of Spanish youths armed with broadswords and pikes and with pistolets at their side , to whom I explained in their own tongue that we came as peaceful ambassadors , desiring but to know the name of their master and be brought to his presence . The manner of these Spanish soldiers was provoking in the extreme , for they made great sport of the fashion in which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog or bear that I must growl and bark instead of speaking like a man . I replied that I had a good many hundred companions at my rear and a good many muskets and swords besides , and if they doubted I was a man , I should be pleased to address them in a sterner fashion at some future time when they might discover that I was more than man enough to confound a dozen of their nation ; but for the present , I reminded them , I lacked weapons , being upon an embassy of peace and goodwill . This speech caused these foolish  | youths even more merriment than before and they spoke many things to each other that , because they were said so rapidly , I could not understand , but nevertheless they conducted us to the town . Between our camp and San Pedro the hill was densely wooded , the trees being roped together with vines , so that our journey was in the gloom of the jungle . Before the town , however , was an area perhaps a hundred yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stumps remained , and I judged that this was most likely done so as to deny enemies the cover of the forest . It was a peculiar sensation , however , to step from the jungle into this clearing , and I marveled how many weeks it had been since we had seen cleared land , for even among the Caribs the land had not been cleared so much as the town built in the midst of the woods . I marveled , too , at the whiteness of San Pedro , for within the city every building was painted with a kind of chalky whitewash very pleasant to behold and this served to make the rooms comfortable even upon the hottest days . And the manner of the town was this : in the center was a public square , paved with a fair gray stone quarried from the mountain behind us , and this served to prevent dust in their summer season , which is almost entirely without rain ; upon the western side of this square was situated the governor 's house , and upon the east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | took its name , with the buildings of a convent huddled against this church upon the north . All about this square ran the houses of the town , two stories high , the one connected to the other , and arranged in the shape of a horseshoe , the open end being upon the east wall behind the church . Now the gate of the town was upon the west wall , and this was very cunningly contrived , so that entering we found ourselves upon a kind of street or lane between the wall and the back of the houses , and to reach the square we were constrained to walk about the rear of the houses , coming into the square next the church , and in this manner they made of their houses a kind of barbican or secondary defense in case they were attacked and the enemy came within the walls . Against the walls were built a series of hovels or shacks , constructed out of mud and timber but whitewashed like the rest of the town , and in these shacks dwelt their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number , perhaps two or three hundred in all , most of whom were Negroes but some Caribs amongst them , only of the latter they kept no males but only females , and of these only the fairest , as they were used for concubines as well as for spinning and dyeing and suchlike domestic tasks . But what I marveled most to see was the number of fine craftsmen they had in that town , as potters and cobblers , carvers , basketweavers , chandlers , joiners , cabinetmakers , and smiths of divers kinds ; and these workmen practiced their arts  | upon the ground floors of their houses , dwelling upon the upper floors , many of them with their wives that they had brought from Spain . As we were being carried to the governor , I was most careful to note their fortifications , which I judged to be cunning , as the barbican witnessed , and yet less than perfect , being intended more for defense against the savages than for an army such as ours . Nor did I reckon there were above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for gold mining , I saw no testimony of it . Don Carlos de Valdes , the governor , received us in his chamber , which was a simple cell not unlike a monk 's , and yet he himself was very richly dressed in a silken gown with a jeweled girdle and a great jeweled cross upon his breast , so that I bethought myself with shame how beggarly were mine own best garments in comparison with these . But as richly dressed as he was , so too was he rude and disdainful , neither rising himself to receive us nor offering us anything upon which to sit , and no sooner had we entered the chamber than he charged us with being invaders upon the King 's , his master 's , territories , and demanded to know our numbers , our leaders , and the causes of our coming thither . Being exceedingly angry at this discourteous use of us by the governor , as well as the former mockery of his men , I replied that all this I would reveal when it suited me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least a bench to sit  | upon and use us with that respect due to our sovereign James and his servant Sir Walter Raleigh , who was our Admiral and chief , and I added that I had two several times visited the cities of the cannibals and never yet been used with such rudeness as I found in this place . Don Carlos made a show of dismay , saying he was sorry not to be a savage that he might receive me with the proper courtesy , and he commanded that seats be brought , whereupon two low joint stools were carried in , fitter for women or boys to sit upon than men , but , seeing as how they were determined to misuse us , we remained standing until proper chairs were finally procured . I explained now that we were a party of six hundred English mariners and soldiers I thought it prudent somewhat to overstate our numbers bent upon exploring that region for no other purpose than trading with the savages and whatever discoveries we might make , of which I said his town was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be actually possessed of any Christian prince . I added that we greatly marveled that they had been so uncivil as to cannonade our fleet , for all we required of them was to allow us to pass peacefully upriver . The Spaniard answered that we must be very ignorant indeed not to know that all that continent belonged to his master , and as for our passage , that was a matter it were fitter he should discuss with my Admiral than with a mere messenger like myself .  | Hearing myself referred to as a messenger , I waxed very passionate , and hotly informed the governor that I was in fact a captain of a great galleon and at least as great a man as himself and that if he wished to speak with Raleigh he would have to follow the river to the sea where that noble Admiral awaited us with three galleons and as many more men as would garrison five such towns as his of San Pedro . Don Carlos smiled and I realized that I had thus in my passion given out more information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a witness how the sly Spaniard will every time outwit the frank Englishman in talk . Why , said Don Carlos , he was indeed grieved if he had not used me according to my estate , and in future he would remember not to judge an Englishman 's rank either by his attire or his wit . But , as for our passage , he said , we must subscribe to a proclamation recognizing the territory as the King of Spain 's and contracting that any goods , metals , or stones we procured should go to the Spanish crown , our word not to stand of itself , but fifty of our mariners to be held in San Pedro for our bond . These arrogant terms I naturally rejected out of hand , informing the governor that I should return the following day when perhaps he would think better of letting us pass upon a more reasonable condition , for , if it came to that , I said , we surely had the power to compel him to let us  | pass upon no condition at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers as our escorts , I thought to try whether there were gold in San Pedro , and therefore I pointed to the nunnery across the square , remarking to one of the soldiers that it was peculiar there should be such a place in a town devoted to the gathering of gold . Whether he perceived by shift I can not say , but he denied there was any gold in the country , saying that nevertheless San Pedro should one day be a great city for they intended to subdue all the savages of these parts and make of them a Christian empire , and already , he said , there were in the nunnery four holy women who had formerly been savages , slaves , and concubines like the rest . I now inquired about the church itself , thinking that it was a good strong house and a fair place for the safekeeping of such a precious thing as gold , wherefore I asked if it might be possible to visit it . Whereas all the other houses were whitewashed , this of the church was painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw that much of their effort had gone to the adorning of it , for it was indeed passing rich within , with many gold and silver ornaments as well as jeweled cloths and divers rare carvings very artfully made , and yet of gold from a mine there was none in this place . After this , not having found what we came for , we took our leave from the town , passing out through the gate and the cleared area and so  | into the jungle again , and indeed I thought it a great wonder that here in the midst of this savage country there should be such a town , and twenty years before no town at all , but now many workmen and houses and streets and a nun 's house withal . I reported to my companions the things I had seen , describing to them the defenses and citizens of San Pedro , together with the insolent manner in which I had been used and Don Carlos 's terms for passage , and I said that I had searched and questioned but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church . I told them , too , about the nun 's house and the four savage women in it , but Wat Raleigh said I must not be familiar with the fashion of the Spanish , else I would not marvel so at this , for their manner is , he said , to conquer savage towns by force and then , first slaughtering all the men and children , to carry away the women and use them according to their lusts , and when these have been satisfied , they beat and otherwise torture the women until they admit themselves Christians , and those who refuse are kept a few months longer and then killed . And thus , he said , the Spaniard is worse than any cannibal savage , however fair he may speak . But when he heard of the arrogance of Don Carlos and his soldiers , Wat said it was insufferable that an English gentleman should be used in such a manner , and he swore that he would reduce that town to dust and ashes . 90 GOLDING 'S TALE  | Keymis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting , and he made Wat promise not to lead any attack without his consent , for we did not know for certain , he said , where the mine lay and perhaps it was not here at all but somewhat farther upriver , the town being a kind of wall to shield it from strangers . And this was what Keymis proposed , that the next morning I should return to Don Carlos and treat with him of our passage , and meanwhile he would lead an armed party around to the mountain to see if the mine was there . We set that evening a strong watch of which I was in command of the first half and Wat Raleigh of the second . Our men , both those of the watch and those in their tents , were uneasy at lying so near the Spanish town , for they supposed that the Spanish were all enchanters and could appear without warning amongst us and slay us on the ground . But I assured them that the Spanish must be more fearful of us than we of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their soldiery by six or seven to one . Nevertheless , the woods were so black , and the noise of the insects so loud , that it would have been possible for an army to have come within twenty yards of us without betraying themselves , wherefore we lit many fires upon the far side of our ditch . My own watch was sufficiently quiet , and I had just surrendered my command to Wat and retired to my blanket when I heard a pistol fired MARK ROSE 91  | and a clashing of swords , and I hurried back to the ditch where I found one of our men already dead and another sitting dazed on the ground with a great wound in his neck . But Wat was nowhere to be seen , although there was a crashing in the woods and shouting . And then I discovered a young Spaniard , hardly more than a boy , with a musket ball in the groin , endeavoring to creep into the woods , and from him I learned that he had been one of a party of four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he swore that they had intended us no harm . By this time a great part of the camp was aroused , the men dashing about in confusion , some clothed , some half-naked , some armed , and some empty-handed , all trying to discover what had occurred . A number bore torches , which was a mistake , for no sooner were these seen than a musket exploded in the woods and one of the torchbearers dropped to the ground . At this same moment there was a great cry from the woods and Wat appeared , his sword all bloody , as he ran amongst the companies , rousing them to action , for we had been set upon by a score of Spanish , he said , who had hoped to rout our camp , thinking that if they attacked in the night they might terrorize us before we saw how few they were . And now Wat began to cry for us to rush to San Pedro and seize it before they returned . Follow me , he cried , for that town is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOLDING 'S TALE  | wise are fools , and , saying this , he charged into the wood at the head of a great crowd , which , mistaking his words , was shouting , " On to the mine . " It was so dark in the woods and so many men crying divers things , and no man knowing which way to turn or who was his enemy or friend , and every moment a pistol shot striking fear into every man 's heart , that I marvel we were not all slain in that confusion . I was rushing forward now near Wat when he turned about and shouted , intending I suppose to encourage the men on , and as he turned there was a great report very near , and he fell upon his knees all doubled over , the ball having struck him full in the face , and at last he collapsed upon the ground and died . I , believing the enemy at hand , and fearing for my own life , fired my two pistols into the darkness and drew my sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this moment there came up behind me John Williams , my old lieutenant , shouting that the Spanish were at hand and he had just slain one with his pistol , but it was Wat Raleigh he had shot and no Spaniard , and I told him Wat was dead , not saying by whose hand , and indeed I have not to this day revealed that it was John Williams and not the Spanish that killed Wat in the confusion of that night . The other men coming up , they were all impassioned to discover Wat slain for they had loved him as a man better than themselves , and MARK ROSE 93  | they swore they would have revenge of the Spaniard , for the mine was theirs by right and they should take it ; and so they departed bearing torches , muskets , pikes , and swords , and shouting terribly as they went . At this point Keymis arrived in a humor betwixt rage and despair , for he had already heard of what had occurred , and he was more wroth with the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although they had often fallen out upon divers matters , and now he cursed Wat for a reckless boy , saying he had got no less than his merits , charging into the woods after the Spanish in that way , and he said that ever since we had come upon the Spanish town he had feared this would happen as Wat would not be ruled by him to behave with reason . But now he fell to cursing Raleigh , saying it was his fault this had come about , for had the Admiral not yielded to the men 's demands Wat never would have died , but Raleigh should have known that if he sent out his son as commander he would never see him again . And all this while he raged the tears were coursing down his cheeks , and then he knelt and kissed Wat 's hand , swearing that he would avenge him , and he would see this Don Carlos hanged , for he had begun this battle and not the English , and so he would tell Raleigh . Moreover , said Keymis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would find they had the secret of a passing rich mine , although no wealth of gold might repay Raleigh for the 94 GOLDING 'S TALE  | loss of his son . And now he commanded that two men carry Wat 's body back to the camp , but the rest of us he led on through the woods . In a hollow not very far from where Wat had fallen we discovered two Spaniards , one of them wounded , and indeed they would not have been found at all in the darkness and the confusion but that the injured one had swooned and fallen as we came by . Hauling them forth , Keymis demanded of them had they slain Wat Raleigh , but the one being wounded was not able to speak and the other was so terror-struck that he could do no more than plead for mercy , and , as for myself , I judged it best not to speak what I knew about Wat 's death . Therefore Keymis took these Spanish and slew them in turn , grasping each one by the hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he then hurled into the darkness . The Spanish had shown no mercy to Wat , he said , and why should we be kinder to them , and a great noise went up as the men shouted their approval .  | In this manner we came to the clearing before the town where we found in the waning moonlight a disordered battle already in progress between our men and the Spanish , the latter defending themselves from the vantage of the towers , hurling down pikes and stones as well as firing with muskets and pistols and hailshot from their small ordnance . But our own men , although they outnumbered the Spaniards many times , were in great confusion , running hither and thither according to no settled principles and firing upon the towers whenever they might . At this moment the gates opened and Don Carlos charged forth at the head of a party of 96 GOLDING 'S TALE  | about forty regular soldiers , judging , I suppose , that our men were in such disorder that we might , despite our numbers , be dispersed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great speed with lowered pikes and their swords flying over their heads , and in this charge a number of our men , taken by surprise , were killed . Moreover , a large number of others turned and ran in the confusion , hurrying back to the protection of the dark woods , and among these I myself was caught , swept along by the crowd , and so we scattered through the jungle in terror , many falling upon vines or trees , the Spanish crashing after us at our backs , making a great slaughter of any man who had fallen or otherwise might be caught . But I perceived that the wisest shift in such straits was not to move at all , wherefore throwing myself against a stout tree , I endeavored to remain still , trusting that in the darkness and confusion I should not be seen . My two pistols I had in my hands and all about me men were crashing both of the enemy and our own company , and once a Spaniard came within five feet of my face ; nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealing myself and being compelled to run like the others , probably to stumble and fall and so be slaughtered . But to be still and not move at that time required , I believe , more boldness than to run , for every moment I thought to be discovered and slain against my  | tree with a pike or sword through my breast . When I returned to the open , Keymis had taken command , and the Spanish company were driving back to the gates , which they succeeded in doing just as dawn was breaking upon the far side of the town . And now Keymis arranged an orderly barrage of the towers , which were manned by no regular soldiers but by workmen and slaves , so that we soon compelled these men to take cover , I myself felling with a musket an old man , who was leaning imprudently far from the middle tower with a pistol . Keymis commanded now that the torches and brands be hurled within , as no longer being required for light they might perhaps dismay the enemy with fires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men to take down the gates . These were stout , being made of small trees lashed with cable and spiked with crossbeams , but our numbers were sufficient so that heaving against them we caused the great iron hinges first to bend and then to rip from the pillars entirely , whereupon , the gates falling forward on the sudden , the men dropped one upon the other in a heap , one man receiving a musket ball in the neck from a piece that accidentally went off . Running into the street between the houses and the wall , we found the roofs of the houses all manned by Spaniards , besides which the men upon the towers revealed themselves again , so that we were trapped in a manner of cross fire  | from the towers and the houses . Nor was it possible to flee back beyond the wall for there was a great crowd now rushing after us through the gate , pressing us farther into the street . But in truth there could not have been more than twenty Spanish upon the roofs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no more than to hold us in this barbican for a sufficient time to allow the citizens to escape through a tunnel or undermining built for such an occasion . The torches we had thrown had caused several of the houses to catch fire , the smoke of which made our eyes to smart and burn ; but this smoke served to some extent as a protection and shield from the Spanish musket fire . Nevertheless , we must have lost in this part of the battle some eight or nine men , most of whom were struck by those upon the roof who were regular soldiers led by Don Carlos . By degrees we forced these men back and at last , finding there was no more resistance and indeed no more Spaniards to be seen , we rushed in a great crowd down the street past the burning houses and then around the church to the main square , which was deserted except for a few slaves upon the steps of the governor 's house whom the men slew in their zeal although there was no need . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Keymis gave orders that  | they should be discovered and pursued , but this command the men either did not hear or chose not to heed , for already the more venturesome among them had fallen to pillaging and looting , and the remainder wasted no time in following their example . The wisest were those who ran for the church , rightly judging this would be the richest house in the town , and these came away with many fine things , as crosses and chalices and censers all of silver and gold as well as jeweled cloths and divers rich books . But those who reached the church first were amazed to discover , kneeling before the rail , four nuns who had somehow failed to escape with the others , and one of these was a savage woman such as I have described . Now the nuns made a show of courage , thinking I suppose that it were a great profit to them to be martyred in their church ; and yet , our men approaching with fierce looks , they screamed and fled down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the savage woman , instead of running , fell upon the nearest man and sank her teeth in his neck like a beast , meanwhile clawing at his flesh with her nails , and indeed he could not rid himself of her , wherefore he was perforce constrained to slay her , although it was a thing he was very loath to do . But , the nun being dead , he took from her body a great silver cross , judging this his due for the bleeding wound in his neck . I00 1 GOLDING 'S TALE  | The other nuns , however , ran weeping out upon the porch and down the steps , where they caused great merriment among those who beheld them flying like hens from the coop , and so they were pursued once or twice about the square in sport and thence out of town , disappearing at last into the woods . But the most part of the men scrambled upon the houses , hurling stools , tables , beds , chests , chairs , and linen into the street , whilst others gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I myself , being in sore need of boots , procured a very good pair of soft brown Spanish leather , which I wear to this day , but entering into the general riot of looting I naturally disdained to do . Some , however , dashed about with as many as six cloaks upon their backs and an equal number of gold or silver chains about their necks , and bore boxes or chests in their arms besides . When a house was thoroughly pillaged and its furniture cast down in a heap before the door , it was set afire as a sign there was no more to be got in that place . But others there were , less mindful of gain and more mad for destruction , who pleasured themselves by indiscriminately firing everything in sight , and sometimes these would rush into a building and set the ground floor ablaze in such a fashion that for themselves there was no escape except by leaping from the upper windows , and the more the fires crackled and roared the more passionate  | these became in their frenzy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the livestock of the town , as chickens , goats , geese , porks , and cows , being set free from their pens , ran about the square , adding to the noise with their cries , and when they had taken their fill of the houses the mariners turned upon these beasts , butchering them in the street with swords or axes or whatever else came to hand , so that now the square ran with the blood of fowls and cattle as well as men , the carcasses being cast in heaps , either later to be carried to the vessels for provisions or to lay there in the sun and rot . One cow , however , they presently cut up to eat , roasting the flesh even in the fires of the burning houses . Moreover , they discovered the town 's store of wine in a house upon the square , and so together with the meat the men consumed great hogsheads of wine , beslobbering themselves in their haste to guzzle the largest quantity possible as it streamed from the casks , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or no , for they were content with what they might drink within the hour . And thus all was looting and burning and feasting and this lasted through the morning and into the afternoon as well . Keymis himself gave no thought to whether the men rioted as all his concern was to discover if the Spanish possessed a mine , wherefore he hastened to the governor 's house and there fell  | to overturning chests and drawers in the hope that somewhere amongst Don Carlos 's papers he might find some indication of where the mine lay . But , discovering nothing , he concluded that the governor must have burned or carried off all the papers relating to the gold . We lost in all in this fight some thirty men , together with another twenty who later died of their wounds , and the Spanish lost perhaps half the number we did . The bodies of the dead lay both within the walls and without , and there were some , too , that we found in the woods . These bodies we buried all together in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this that very afternoon , as on account of the climate they had already begun to stink , and we feared they might attract beasts and so endanger us in our camp . Among the corpses we discovered one Spaniard yet living , whom the men proposed to slay and bury with the rest , but Keymis ordered that he be taken back to the camp and questioned to determine if he knew aught of the mine . That evening , whilst the men caroused and played at stakes with their prizes , I examined the prisoner . I found this Spaniard very weak with his wound and frightened besides , for his priests and governors had told him monstrous tales of how we treated Papists , constraining them to blaspheme and curse the Savior or die . But these things I assured him were lies , for all we wished was to know if there were a mine MARK ROSE 103  | upon the river , and we would compel him , I promised , to do nothing against his conscience or faith . The Spaniard was much relieved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he believed he was dying , he said , and greatly feared for his soul , especially as there was no priest to be had amongst us to shrive him . As for a mine , he had neither seen nor heard of any such thing , for the only purpose of their town had been the Christianizing of the savages . I replied that I believed him and reported this to Keymis , who said that I must be a fool if I thought it was so . But I would see , he said , that on the mountain behind the town we should tomorrow discover a passing rich mine . Early the next morning , before commencing the search , we buried Wat Raleigh in San Pedro . The body , which had begun to corrupt , we sewed into his colors taken down from the pinnace , and on it we placed his helm in military fashion . But the sword we did not bury with him , for Keymis preserved it to bring back to the Admiral . All the men of our company who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind them in show of grief , whilst Keymis , Griffiths , and myself , together with a common mariner chosen from the ranks , carried the bier . And thus , very melancholy upon this sorrowful occasion , we proceeded from our camp to the empty town with the drums sounding the dirge. 104 GOLDING 'S TALE  | We reached the town just as the day 's heat was beginning , and we saw now how much damage we had wrought , for the most part of the houses were either gutted or burned to the ground , all the walls formerly white being now blackened and charred , and the wide square strewn with rubbish amongst which such of the livestock as had not been slaughtered now rooted and picked , looking for somewhat to eat . We bore Wat to the church , which alone stood intact , and , raising the stones beneath the altar , made a kind of crypt for him in the earth . Those Papist images that still hung upon the walls , having been disdained by our men as of little worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cast into the square , thinking it unseemly that an English gentleman should lie with such things about him . And now Keymis bade all the congregation kneel whilst he read the service , which he did with such manly tears coursing from his eyes as it had been his son and not Raleigh 's we were putting to rest . The service concluded , Keymis addressed the men , telling how in attacking the town we had violated the Admiral 's command and the King 's , and he explained that Raleigh 's life was now forfeit unless we found the mine , adding that their own lives might be forfeit as well if such were the King 's will when we returned . But this was not so , and he said it merely to stir up their fears so that they would not give over the search for MARK ROSE 105  | the mine . Nevertheless , the men believed him and being angry that they had not been told before that their lives lay in question , many of them commenced to shout out against Raleigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were in a church , and he said he did not think it was come to hanging yet , for he had good hope that these Spanish had found and worked our mine , which indeed he prayed was the case , wherefore he now commanded the men to scatter over the mountain that lay behind the town and see if the mine might be there . To this task the men went as anxiously as if their salvation indeed depended upon it , for they were terrified of hanging , each man conceiving the rope as already thrown about his neck and imagining perhaps whether he would have to be carried to the scaffold in chains and whether he would , like some who are about to hang , vainly attempt to flee , the crowd hooting and laughing at his struggles , for they had all more than once witnessed these things and knew the manner of them ; wherefore now , with such contemplations as a spur , they had no shift but to place their faith in Keymis and do whatever he wished , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from it . They searched with great ardor until darkness came , but there was no more a mine upon this Spanish mountain than there had been upon any of the others , and thus the men were more than  | ever frightened . But I was angry rather than fearful and cursed myself that I had been cozened by Raleigh to take part in this voyage , for , seeking gold , it was plain , we should find naught but death . And now I charged Keymis with these things , saying I was convinced that there was no gold in Guiana at all . Whatever I might think , Keymis said , Raleigh had seen the mine and he had seen it , too , and whether we performed it or not that fact would remain true , that there was a great fortune of gold in this country . I said that I had heard enough of his oaths upon the mine and that , for myself , I was ready to swear that they had never seen it with their own eyes as they claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Raleigh had been little better than thieves preying upon the substance of honest men . Here Keymis became hot , saying that all I cared for was my own profit and safety and if Raleigh were hanged that mattered not to me . I might speak what I liked about himself , but to call the Admiral a thief was nothing but infamy , for that man was of the noblest , most honest , and generous nature that might be , and there was not so much guile in Raleigh as in a wawling infant of three months but only openness and mercy and love . And as he spoke the tears sprang into his eyes and he protested that neither he nor I were worth the parings of MARK ROSE 107 1  | Raleigh 's nails , so far was he above the rout of such common fellows as we . Why , said I very bitter , if that were so then I was a fool , having followed him for a sailor and not a saint . That night , wearied with the afternoon 's fruitless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brain to do any useful thing , I betook myself to prayer , begging that we might be shown some way to better our wretched fortunes . As I was praying , I gradually became aware of cries or rather shrieks coming from the woods behind the camp . At first I conceived one of our men had been seized by a wild beast , but , the cries continuing for longer than would have been likely in such a case , I realized on the sudden that Keymis must be torturing the Spanish prisoner . It made me mad to think that Keymis would do such a thing , for could he not see that the Spanish had no gold and that if we were ever to discover a mine it must be by other means than these ? And I knew that if Wat Raleigh had been alive he would have disdained to undertake such practices , saying that these sports we should rather leave to the Spanish themselves as fitter by far for a Castilian grandee than an English gentleman , and especially when it was evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking to recall Keymis to his senses , I followed the cries through the woods to a small IOH GOLDING 'S TALE  | clearing , lit by a bonfire , where indeed I found Keymis , together with two stout mariners , at least one of whom I knew to have been formerly a murderer and thief , and , naked to the waist as they were , with the firelight shining upon their faces , these three truly appeared more like savages than men . The misfortunate Spaniard they had bound to a tree all entirely naked , and his wound , which was a great sword wound in the belly , they had opened and rubbed with salt and let run so that all his nether parts were covered with blood that gleamed in the firelight like some brave vermilion dye . But this had all been accomplished earlier , and now the mariners had taken up each in his hand a fiery torch , making merry with these by touching them to the Spaniard upon his various parts , so that all his hair was long since burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing a foul stench , and each time they touched the torch to his flesh , the Spaniard would begin to shriek and cry out , but , after a few moments , they would remove the fire lest the pain become too great and he be rendered insensible . Keymis was exceedingly wroth , and he was shouting near as loud as the Spaniard , saying he knew there was a mine somewhere upriver and that Don Carlos had fled there to disguise it lest we discover it , and he swore that he would kill the Spaniard and Don Carlos as well , together  | with all his countrymen from here to Madrid , but we had not come thus far and lost so many men and Wat Raleigh among them , only now to give over the enterprise and return to England with empty hands , for he must not suppose that Wat Raleigh had died without purpose , although surely it had been folly to run thus into the woods , wherefore the Spaniard must know that we should one way or another find their mine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were less obstinate . Now whether the wretched Spaniard could make anything of these disjointed speeches I can not say , but all this while he denied there was any gold , begging Keymis to command the mariners to stop . As for Don Carlos , he said , he believed the governor had not gone upriver at all but quite the other way , toward Trinidados , for he had learned , the Spaniard said , where our galleons lay , and intended to slip by them and escape to the Spanish city on the island . But Keymis said the man was a manifest liar , for how might Don Carlos know aught of our galleons ? And he commanded the mariners to be less gentle with their torches as it appeared that by kindness they would get nowhere with this fellow . Hearing this , the man nearest me leapt forward with a shout and plunged his torch directly into the Spaniard 's eye , which burst like a grape , gushing blood as the torch seared the flesh even 110 1 GOLDING 'S TALE  | to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have scarce heard the like , sought to cover his face with his hands ; but , as he was struggling , the other mariner extinguished his other eye in the same fashion . Now I being heartily sickened by this unprofitable savagery , swore to Keymis I would report his practices to Raleigh , and with respect to Don Carlos and the galleons , I explained that the Spaniard probably spoke the truth for I myself had told the governor of them . Keymis replied that he did not give a fig for what I thought , saying that he knew me now for a notorious scoundrel , and as I reckoned my own neck to be safe , he said , I cared not whether another were hanged . Was it not a brave thing , he said , that I should have more charity for a lying Spaniard , one of those that had slain Wat Raleigh , than I had for the Admiral himself ? And here he cursed me with many oaths and at last ordered me to be gone and not meddle in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that otherwise Keymis might come back with some fanciful tale of how the Spaniard before his death had revealed the mine ; but so wroth was I and so sickened withal , that I was relieved to return to my blanket , and yet even there I could not escape the cries of the Spaniard , which continued for perhaps another hour until they ceased entirely and I was at last able to sleep .  | But in the morning it was even as I had feared , for , calling an assembly , Keymis told the mariners that the Spaniard had revealed to him that there was a mine upriver to which Don Carlos had fled . Whether Keymis honestly believed this had happened or whether he merely thought some such tale was necessary to persuade the mariners to go on , I can not say , as he refused to discuss the matter with me . Moreover , neither of the men who had been with him was able to say with certainty what had happened that night , for , not understanding the Spanish tongue , the prisoner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this with Griffiths , who said it was doubtless policy not fancy and that Keymis intended to prospect farther upriver , and he convinced me that , things having fallen out as they had , we had best allow him his will , such being the only hope of procuring riches . Our condition at this time was more desperate than I have yet indicated , for ever since our first quest for the mine the fever had spread among us , and by now it had become commonplace for every day two or three men to fall ill of this old infection , so that we had already lost some thirty-five souls , together with another score of men who still lay ill upon the strand in the place we had reserved for them as far from the rest of the camp as might be , and among these was my old lieutenant John Williams , who had suc 112 GOLDING 'S TALE  | cumbed on the same day Wat Raleigh was buried . We were all exceedingly fearful of setting out again with these infected men , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon us , but we would be in a kind embracing our own destruction by carrying them , for in the narrow space of the vessels the infection would grow even more violently than before . Keymis said that in these straits we must act like men not women , conducting ourselves according to the strictest rules of reason . Did we not think the Admiral when he lay sick at sea would rather himself had died then and there than that all our voyage should come to naught ? And if we carried these infected men , would not our entire enterprise be imperiled ? As for himself , he said , he believed he was as merciful as any man , and yet in such a case one must subject his private feelings to the common good , which not to do were both cowardly and selfish , especially as not ourselves only , but all those awaiting us upon the galleons were dependent upon our success . And for these reasons , he said , he had determined that the sick men must be left behind . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy , being as they were even more afeared of the infection than of hanging . Griffiths , too , having a great dread of the fever , thought it a sound thing to do ; and I myself consented , albeit somewhat reluctantly , for , al- though I did not care for the others , being for the most part but common mariners , I regretted to leave Williams who had served me long and well . Now that it was determined what we were to do , the men were in a great haste to do it , being very anxious to be on the water again and gone from that infected place . Moreover , believing Keymis 's tale of the Spaniard , they were once again convinced that we were at the point of success . But first Keymis dispatched a company under Griffiths to set fire to whatever in San Pedro had not yet been burned , excepting of course the church in which Wat Raleigh 's corpse lay . The rest of the men we put to loading the vessels with the victuals we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our numbers now so reduced both by the fighting and the fever that we judged them sufficient to maintain us for a considerable time . And even as this was proceeding , we observed the column of smoke rising from the burning town . Before we departed I went to the strand to bid John Williams farewell . I found him weak as might be expected and yet still in good command of his faculties . He inquired why it was the dead had not been removed that morning , showing me that the man next to him had died in the night , his wasted corpse still lying huddled upon the blanket and already beginning to stink . I did not avoid the issue , nor did I cast it in any light 114 1 GOLDING 'S TALE  | other than that in which I genuinely saw it . I told him that we were departing , reluctantly abandoning the sick for the sake of the common good , and I told him such reasons as I knew why we had to do this , and asked for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not fail to pray for him in return . I do not believe he understood me at first , for he asked when would he see me again , tomorrow or the day after , but at last he grasped my meaning , which indeed he took very stoically like a true man and a Christian , saying after a space that he believed he was a dead man anyway and only prayed for a quick release . I thought it best not to embrace him but merely clasped his hand . As I was leaving , however , he called me back and bidding me bend close , whispered , " It is very hard , " and after this he shut his eyes and composed his hands and said nothing more . But whether he meant that death was very hard or that our decision to leave them behind was very hard I do not know .  | We departed early that afternoon in two pinnaces and the barge , the pinnace that had been Wat Raleigh 's being left behind for want of men to fill it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . We had not been on the water three hours at the most when I discovered a strange heaviness about my limbs , especially in the lower part of my legs . I assumed at first that this was no more than a natural weariness , the result of the difficulties and trials of the last few days , but , the heaviness waxing toward evening , I became sufficiently concerned to withdraw to my cabin , where I no sooner lay down than I began to sweat profusely . When the sweating spell was past and I could reason again , I 116 1 GOLDING 'S TALE  | bethought myself what were best to do , for I was quite alarmed and that not so much by the fever as by my own men , fearing that if they understood I was ill they would certainly put me ashore to die a most wretched and lonely death . Therefore I considered that I must conceal my condition as long as possible , and indeed my early recognition of the true nature of my situation was a happy occurrence for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making camp , my strength still being sufficient to feign soundness , I called my pilot , Arthur Whyte , to me and told him privately that I must be gone for some days upon a most secret occasion , which would bring sure profit in gold to myself and to him as well if he did as I said . To give this tale a certain color of authenticity I hinted that I meant to trade secretly with certain savages in that region for gold that I knew they possessed , saying that I would rejoin our companies farther upstream after I completed the business . Whyte was to be in command in my absence , assuring the men during these days that I was ashore on an errand of great importance . To all this Whyte readily assented , greedy for profit , and indeed the men might never have discovered my true whereabouts but that Whyte himself five days later contracted the fever and was thrown overboard by the men to sink or swim as he might . All the while I was speaking with this man my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might collapse under me , and even before we  | were done I knew the sweating was coming on again . Lest I be seen in this condition I crept into the forest and collapsed beneath a tree where for the next hour I experienced such agony as I hope I shall never again know , for this spell was much worse than the first and I had by now a most extreme horror of discovery , lying not fifty feet from the men , whose voices I could hear in the gloom as they ate their suppers . The spell at length passing , I made my way very secretly to one of the jolly boats and thence to my barge , where entering the hold I took a fair supply of biscuit and some fruit , conveying them to my cabin , after which I returned for a barrel of water , which , weakened as I was , I yet contrived to haul , placing it in a convenient position adjacent to my bunk . My final trips were to the armory , where I secured half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great leathern bag of powder . I also took two muskets and a long pike , although I must have realized that I would soon be too weak to make any use of this latter weapon , and at last from the joiner 's chest procured a hammer and nails . With these articles I staggered back to my cabin , where I proceeded to nail up the door very tight , thinking as I did this that for certain I was nailing the lid to mine own coffin , for I thought it could not be but I was a dead man . And thus , commending myself to the mercy of God , I fell exhausted onto my bunk where I lay for a long time insen- sible to the world . I awoke with a throat burning as if the fiend himself were in it and my head pained me greatly besides . To ease my throat I swallowed some water and tried to eat a quantity of biscuit , for , although I was not at all hungry , it had been many hours since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved until I should need it more . Feeling somewhat refreshed , I lay my two muskets and six pistols on the bunk before e and cleaned , charged , and loaded them each , placing them ready to hand so that I might reach them all without rising from my bunk . After this I again fell asleep , this time with the pike in my hands . Even now my hand trembles as I recall my dream . I dreamt that I was asleep in my bunk and the Admiral came to my side and woke me , but it was not the Admiral , for when he smiled I saw that his teeth were filed and pointed like those of the Caribs and then I noticed that his face was all tattooed , yet somehow this did not disturb me . The Admiral put his hand on my arm and inquired how I was feeling and I said well , for in my dreams I was not ill . But he shook his head sadly and said , no , he feared I had waned badly for there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I must immediately be given somewhat to eat else I would surely die . I looked at my arm and saw that it was but the bones of a skeleton and I was very frightened . Then we stood in the woods where a crowd was  | gathered , including Wat Raleigh , Keymis , Griffiths , John Williams , and Arthur Whyte , and they all had filed teeth and tattoos . The Admiral asked me if I would eat , and I cried yes and begged that it be quick for I should perish if I did not get somewhat to eat . And so they took hold of John Williams and they tore off his right arm , he standing before me all this time with a placid smile as if he did not mind at all , and the arm was very bloody with the flesh hanging down in strips where it had been torn off . They gave me the arm to eat , which I did very greedily , devouring it whole , the bones and all . The Admiral inquired was I still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to death , for that single arm had been almost nothing at all . Thereupon they gave me his other arm and when I asked for still more , his legs , his belly , his breast , and finally his head , and thus I had eaten all of John Williams and there was nothing left . The Admiral said that surely by now I must be full , but I said no , and so they gave me a second man , whom I did not know , and then a third , and then the Admiral said that I had eaten enough , for it was unseemly to have such an appetite and I had grown exceedingly fat , which was true as I saw in the glass . At this the crowd began to laugh and they surged forward with all their filed teeth glittering in the firelight and I understood that they were about to eat me . I struck at them with my pike , lashing at their faces , but I was so fat that I was unable to 120 GOLDING 'S TALE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm , and even as they did this to me they plucked at each other as well , ravishing arms and heads , each man gnawing the flesh of his neighbor and simultaneously attempting to ward off the man next himself . And now the Admiral was plucking at my head and I tried with my remaining arm to kill him with my pike , and I could not , and my head was coming off , and so I screamed . My own voice awoke me , for indeed I had cried aloud , and I lay in a great pool of sweat , having evidently had one of my spells whilst I slept . The cabin was now light and beyond the door I heard voices , so it was clear that we were once again under way . For some time I feared that my men might have heard me cry out but no one came to the door , and I resolved that from then on I must sleep with my mouth bound lest I should speak out again in my dreams . To ease the rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having no leeches , I punctured a vein in my thigh and allowed the blood to run onto the floor , afterwards binding the wound with a strip of linen very tight . This vein I reopened at least once a day and from time to time performed certain other ministrations as I had known surgeons to use . And thus I passed a certain space of my life , alone in my cabin and very near death . The sweating spells came now at regular intervals of about three hours , being at their worst in the late afternoon , which was indeed the most dif- ficult time , for not only were the spells then most violent , but my cabin , having received all day the rays of the sun , with little ventilation , the door being nailed shut , was then most unbearably hot . At these times I would wish to be dead and buried , but at all other times I had a great horror of being dead and especially of the corruption of the flesh , a subject upon which I reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mortal fear , and indeed I might have been a pagan , so little did I long for the joy of the life everlasting . During this time I thought much about the Admiral and Keymis , but very disconnectedly and strangely , with the kind of incoherent ideas a fevered man is likely to have , for , reflecting upon whether they had truly cozened us about the mine , I would sometimes find myself in one of my spells , and then I would think that I was Raleigh himself , lying in prison and not upon my barge , and I would see then dancing before my eyes the mountain all of gold and bleeding great stones of gold and I would reach out to grasp it , whereupon it would wither away . But sometimes I knew that it was no golden mountain I saw but a city not built by hand and all the streets of it paved with massy gold , and in the side of the city was a wound , bleeding liquid ore , and I knew then that like Stevenson the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I understood that I was dying . Perhaps it was six or eight wretched days that 122 1 GOLDING 'S TALE  | I spent thus in the worst fits of the fever , nailed in my cabin with the sun beating down upon it , and terrified lest I should utter a sound and be cast into the water to die . Towards the end of this period I realized that , although I was not getting any better , neither was I getting worse , and that I knew from experience was a very hopeful sign . It was during this period , as I afterwards learned , that Arthur Whyte , among others , was indeed put over the side by the men , he having shown the evident marks of the fever . Ironically , it was not even the infection itself that the men feared so much as the prospect of being abandoned if they themselves contracted it , and this was true on all three vessels . They were caught upon a wheel of terror : the more the men feared being abandoned if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anyone who might spread the disease , and thus each man 's fears of being abandoned were increased . Whilst I lay in my cabin all order and reason disappeared from the ships and chaos and unreason were born . The mariners no longer even truly cared about the gold , all any man desired was not to be left alone in the jungle to die . This much I have learned from that voyage to Guiana , that the real passion in man is not greed but fear , for even greed is at last but a species of fear . I write this not by way of apology , for upon the matter of the Admiral 's execution my conscience does not prick me at all , but it is MARK ROSE 123 1  | perhaps a kind of explanation and not for my actions alone but many other things as well . It seems to me likely that the mariners at this time had no thought that I might be in my cabin , for probably they supposed me lost ; wherefore with Whyte being dead nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examining my trunk to discover if I possessed anything of value or use , their captain 's personal goods being as near a thing to a gold mine as they were likely to see . Being asleep , I was awakened by the noise of ' their forcing the door , and when I understood what they were about , I was sufficiently alarmed that I almost shouted out . I had begun to mend by then and was strong enough that I might sit up in bed with ease . Consequently I was able to arrange my pistols and muskets on the bed before me so as to protect myself , and all this I did as quietly as possible whilst they were still struggling with the door . The door bursting open , I gave no warning but fired my musket full in the face of the foremost man as he tumbled into the chamber . All my advantage lay in surprise for I was unable yet to stir from my bunk and if they once passed the door I knew I was a dead man . Even before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened , I had my second musket cocked and pointed , and I fired as they fled , catching my man in the right shoulder with the ball . 124 1 GOLDING 'S TALE  | And now the mariners called in to me in my fortress , asking who I was and what I was doing in that place . I replied that I was their commander and that I had been sick with the fever but was now much improved , saying further that , as they saw , I would not hesitate to defend myself if it were necessary , wherefore I charged them to depart and leave me alone , being sufficiently provided with all I required in the way of victuals and of weapons . Had the men been less cowardly , they might easily have taken me in my cabin even now , but after a space of whisperings I perceived they had departed . Fearing lest they intended to return armed , I got from the bunk with much difficulty , for standing erect I became faint so that it was necessary for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , as best I could , I nailed it shut again . In my carefulness about the door I had neglected to consider what to do concerning the body of the mariner I had killed . The man had fallen on his side across my sea chest with his face half exposed . His Christian name I did not know , but his last name was Quinn and he was a soldier , a former sergeant of horse whom we had taken with us at Plymouth for a seasoned musketeer . I had shot him in the right eye , where the blood still flowed from the wound , staining my chest . But the door now being nailed once more , there was no way I might remove MARK ROSE 125  | this corpse from my chamber , and so I had no shift but to cover him with a blanket and leave him where he lay . Day by day I grew stronger until at last the time came when I was almost entirely well but much abated in the flesh and weakened , having sweat away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at each hip and a sword in my hands , removed the nails from the door and like a ghost walked forth onto my barge . The relief I felt at being freed from my prison I can not express , for indeed every day I improved my cabin had grown more noisome and foul . My men gaped but made no move to touch me , and wherever I came they fell back , giving me wide berth as if I were indeed one returned from the dead . But I was in such a high humor being alive and in the air that I laughed at their fright , assuring them I was no ghost but mine own self and a mortal man . I told them that I was now recovered and well , promising that they had nothing to fear from me in the way of infection , but I warned them too that I was still armed and they might expect me to remain so .  | I had lain sick for about a fortnight whilst Keymis drove the remnants of the fleet farther and farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Carlos , which he believed must lead to gold . Every day he announced new signs that the Spanish had come this way and yet never were the governor 's ships sighted , nor even so much as a savage canoe . He pressed on beyond the end of the mountains , the country changing to a flat and marshy savanna , inhabited only by crocodiles , cormorants , and fish , and now the start of March was come and with it the clouds commencing to roll in the heavens , gathering for the start of their winter in that country , and at night the winds singing and whistling most unusually 128 GOLDING 'S TALE  | and sometimes a thunder over the plain . Even if Keymis found gold there was now no time to work it , and he seemed indeed to have gone mad , driving them on from day to day until at last Griffiths refused to go any farther . This had happened the day before I emerged from my cabin . When Keymis saw Griffiths come about and head downriver , carrying with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mariners to fire upon the pinnace , which they refused to do , as there was not one among them who would not rather be with Griffiths than Keymis , for they had long before given up any hope of fortune , praying only that they might preserve their lives . But Keymis , brandishing his sword in a wild fury , slew his own master of gunnery , whereupon the men obeyed him from fear , and yet before they could find the range , Griffiths was gone , swept downstream by the force of the current . Only a madman would have refused to give up now , and yet he refused it , fiercely insisting that we must find the Spaniards , although there were now but sixty dispirited , frightened men to attack some two hundred Spanish , if they had truly fled this way , so that in any case it was more likely that they should conquer us than we them . The men believed that Keymis was determined upon destroying us all . The afternoon of the fifth day after I emerged  | from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the west , which , swelling and roaring as it were by fits , some hours with more violence than others , at length did beat all light from heaven . All afternoon the angry river hurled itself against the groaning bulwarks until at last about an hour before sunset the hot rain poured from the sky . I have seen such a torrent once or twice in England , but never lasting above five minutes : here it continued for near forty hours before waning at all . That morning Keymis , together with five men , had gone ashore to investigate a column of smoke he had seen from the river and conceived must be either Don Carlos himself or some of his men . When the rains began we expected that Keymis must return , but neither that day nor that night did we see of him any sign . Meanwhile the river continued to rise , advancing at perhaps two inches an hour , and running so fast as she rose that by morning we were hard put to hold our anchors , being in constant peril @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dashed to pieces , wherefore I gave the command both to the pinnace and my barge that we row somewhat upstream where we might take advantage of the leeward side of a small island that lay in the channel . From the great difficulty we experienced in making this island it was clear that whatever Keymis wished the expedition was 130 GOLDING 'S TALE  | ended , for against the winter flood of the Orinoco no man could go farther . All this day I attended Keymis , walking the hatches in a rain so fierce that the force of it upon my shoulders made my flesh burn , but indeed it was hardly better below than in the open , for the water streamed into every corner of the vessel so that after twenty-four hours there was not a dry timber to be seen , nor a square of cloth that did not drip with the wet . Still Keymis remained ashore , and the men of both ships , growing increasingly alarmed by the flood , begged me to lead them home . I did not believe Keymis was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divers reasons I desired to return him to the Admiral , which , explaining to the mariners , I assured them that we would wait no more than a day or two longer . Having heard my reply , the mariners of Keymis 's pinnace proceeded the next morning before dawn to raise anchor and slip away with the current , and indeed I had known well that there was little I could do to prevent this , not being able to be on two ships at once . My own company would have done the same , except for the almost preternatural manner in which they feared me ever since I had been ill . With the pinnace gone we were left with only eighteen men out of the three hundred that set out with us four MARK ROSE 131  | months before , not counting the five men ashore with Keymis . About noon that day the torrent of rain began to abate , declining after an hour to little more than a drizzle . The clouds , however , continued black and angry , rolling like smoke from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I ordered the jolly boats lowered to go ashore , and here I did what I reckoned a wise thing , for I conceived that as soon as I was out of sight the men on my barge would quickly follow the example of the pinnace . To prevent this I took ashore with me , much against their will , ten men , and the remaining eight , too few as I reckoned to man the barge by themselves , these I bound to the stanchions that they might not flee , and so we rowed to land . We found ourselves upon a sodden , marshy plain , a wide savanna , in which the land was all mud and never any solid ground so that with each step we sank knee-deep into mud , and indeed the mud was very putrid with the stink of rotting things , and moreover the men were afeared there might be serpents in this region for it gave every sign of extreme unhealthiness . Meanwhile the clouds were boiling above us , so much the more fuller of horror on account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , beating and whipping our faces , we were constrained to creep upon the earth like vermin and 132 GOLDING 'S TALE  | not like men : and , truly , it seemed to me that ever since San Pedro we had lived more like beasts than men , preying upon each other in the most unspeakable fashion . In this great desert there was no sign of Keymis and hardly any sign of life at all except a few gray cormorants that circled about looking in vain for prey , and where on this plain Keymis could have seen , or thought he had seen , smoke was more than I could say . There was naught to do but to search in one direction or another although no man could say which was best , wherefore , dividing my men into three groups of three each , I sent one to the east , one to the west , and myself led the party to the south , thinking that was as likely a way as any , and thus we crawled through the mud , crying out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three hours , but how long it might have been in fact was impossible to say , as the sun did not once appear and the light if anything grew thicker until , if we had not known otherwise , we should have thought ourselves damned and in Hell as the Tuscan poet describes it . Yet all this time we crept forward , often upon our hands and knees , and in great discomfort , for not only were our clothes wet through to our flesh , but so defiled with the mud as to be a burden upon us , and from time to time we were constrained to MARK ROSE 133 1  | pause and cleanse ourselves , plucking the mud from our breeches and shirts and casting it back upon the ground . My men beseeched me to turn back , complaining that it was hopeless , that we should never find aught in that desert , and besides the rains might begin at any moment , and if they did , there was great likelihood that the river would rise to flood all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no good reason as even now we might save ourselves if we would . But I replied that we should go on a little farther , and if the rains began , I promised we would leave immediately , for I assured them that I was no more anxious to lose my life than themselves . It was perhaps half an hour later that we discovered them , looking , if it had been possible , even filthier than ourselves , for from head to foot , in their hair and their beards , they were all slubbered and besmeared with mud . Keymis was a veritable mountain of mud , the largest object in all that empty country , and as black as a Moor , and I think that at first he conceived we were Spaniards , for he commanded his men to draw their swords and stand ready to seize us . Perceiving at last who we were , he demanded had we found Don Carlos , but I replied that we had found nothing , having come to land for the sole purpose of retrieving himself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he , he wished he had brought fifty men ashore instead of five , for these were such blind fellows that they never would discover a thing . I informed him very gravely that there were not fifty souls left to our company and that all our fleet consisted now of my one barge , his own mariners having fled downriver with the pinnace . By God , he cried , they were all a tribe of wretches and since young Wat died there was not an honest man left to serve Raleigh . It had been a bad omen , Wat 's death . But what had a man been supposed to do ? Youth is ever hotblooded and rash . He had told Raleigh , pleaded with him almost , not to make Wat his equal in command . It was a poor practice to have two commanders and if one of them should be a youth , hardly more than a beardless boy , why then it was disastrous . But the Admiral would not listen to reason , could see no fault in his son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had it not been Raleigh 's fault then , that Wat was killed ? He asked because he wanted my honest judgment on the matter , but as for himself , he said , his heart was free . I pitied Keymis as I listened to this distracted speech , for it was evident that his spirit , working again and again upon the same matter , had succumbed to a species of extreme and unnatural melancholy . Very gently I assured him that in MARK ROSE 135  | my judgment no man was at fault but principally the confusion of the time , and he laughed heartily and said that was his opinion , too . Well , said Keymis , it was all past and forgotten , and what we must do was to find the gold that we had come for in the first place . And he had good hope , he said , that the Spanish were even now within half a mile , for they were men and not spirits and must after all be somewhere , seeing that they could not vanish into thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desolate savanna and truly I thought he must he mad to believe that anything could be in that land . And then I looked at the weary , vacant faces of the men who had been with him these days , and I pictured what it must have been like with Keymis driving those poor men back and forth across that plain , through the rain and the mud . Days later one of the men confided to me that he had been near to murdering Keymis when I arrived , but for the others , he said , Keymis had broken their will , forcing them on and on even past the point of exhaustion and swearing he would shoot any man who so much as spoke of returning before the Spanish were found . Seeing the condition of the men and the mud all about us with the black clouds above and the rains likely to break again , perhaps at any moment , perhaps flooding all the plain , I told Keymis that it could not be that there was any 136 GOLDING 'S TALE  | thing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite undone , for to continue upriver was impossible in that season , and to remain any longer on that plain was a great risk of all our lives , and consequently we had no shift but to withdraw , returning to the Admiral to find what he thought best to do . Hearing these reasonable words , Keymis gave me such a look of scorn as if his mind had been sound I should have taken great offense . Why , said he , and is it not impossible that I should flee to that man to say his son is dead and himself ruined and like to be hanged besides ? Fitter by far that we should be drowned a thousand times than prove such servants to such a master . At that moment , as if nature conspired with Providence to demonstrate the folly of his resolution , there came a monstrous crash of thunder like the globe itself should split in halves , and an instant later the skies released such a violent torrent that we shrank as if Heaven were pelting us with stones . Keymis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crying above the roar that we must be babes to fear a storm , being but wind and water . One of Keymis 's party now seized my hand , begging that I should lead them away from this place before it all became one great sea . Trembling with fear , he cried that Keymis was a madman and fit for nothing but a cage , and in a MARK ROSE 137 1  | moment all the others were about me , crying out as best they might in all that noise and rain for me to lead them away before it was too late . Meanwhile Keymis had pulled his sword from its hanger and this he flung wildly about his head , alternately shouting threats and crying of infinite riches , Spaniards , mines , gold , and I know not what other mad things . In this confusion I somehow got behind Keymis , and , reaching out with a quick motion , seized hold of his sword arm , whereupon he began to spin about in his wrath , and I pulled down upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mud , and he fell upon his side on the ground with the sword beneath him so that it pierced his thigh from one side to the other , making a great and bloody wound . Lying on the ground with the blood running from him , he fixed his stare upon me with his eyes afire as if fevered and said , Golding , you have just slain Raleigh as sure as if you had plucked out his heart with your own hands . But I let this pass , not caring to bandy words in such a time and place , desiring no more than to be gone from that plain , for truly I was as frightened as the men that the river should flood . In great haste I ordered one of the men to bind Keymis 's thigh , for I regretted the wound , although it should not have happened if he had not been deaf to reason , and making a species of  | litter from our shirts we carried him to the jolly boats , where we found the others I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And indeed our fears proved substantial , for we had hardly reached the vessel when the river overleapt its bounds and in little more than an hour all that plain was a wide and treacherous sea .  | Thus Keymis became in a kind my prisoner as we retreated downriver , and the remains of the expedition , such as , they were , passed into my command alone . Keymis was a mere sullen thing , sitting day after day , staring at the rain and the river , nursing his wound , speaking to no man but keeping his own counsel . As for myself , I passed the time very wearily . All our hopes had come to naught . We had discovered no riches , worked no mine . I should return to England with white hairs and as poor as when we had set out with such brave expectations . With these thoughts and others equally melancholy I occupied my time as we allowed the river to sweep us downstream , a journey that took in  | all but ten days , so much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . On the morning of the third day we reached San Pedro , now no town at all but a charred and blackened ruin upon its hill . The beach where our camp had been and where we had abandoned the sick had vanished , the flood having covered all that low-lying ground up to the height of a galleon 's mast . We looked carefully but observed no movement of any kind upon the shore . On the eighth day we arrived at the delta and the region of the Caribs , all flooded now and empty , wherefore we saw no savages and were thankful for it , and at last on the morning of the tenth day we sighted The Destiny and The Good Hope lying along her , together with Griffiths 's pinnace and the one Keymis had commanded , but mine own galleon , The Fortune , was not with them . Spying the fleet , the mariners made a great cheer and attempted to fire a salute , but the powder being wet they could not ignite it , and so we returned without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw us plainly and from some distance away . This was the story of The Fortune : after the fight at San Pedro , Don Carlos , even as our Spanish prisoner said , had fled downriver , slipping by Raleigh in the night , and arriving at last at the Spanish island of Trinidados , where he told all that had occurred . Now the governor of TriniMARK ROSE 1 141 1  | dados , being viceroy for all this region , determined to have revenge for San Pedro , wherefore he dispatched five galleons to drive Raleigh from the river mouth and to slay us on our return . The Spanish galleons appeared one morning before dawn and it was my own vessel that lay hindermost at this time , wherefore in the very first volleys she was struck broadside and her bows all stove in so that she sank almost before she was prepared to fire . The Destiny and The Good Hope , by this time being rigged , the Spanish stood off , expecting that Raleigh when he saw the odds would flee , leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raleigh came on with full sail and a great sea battle ensued , for , although the Spanish were superior in numbers , our galleons were much nimbler and yare , so that at the conclusion of two hours ' hard fighting , it was the Spanish who were driven off , leaving behind them one of their galleons in flames . From the Spaniards he plucked from the the water Raleigh learned of the fight at San Pedro and how we had destroyed it , whereupon he became furious , for did we not know , he said , that his life must be the forfeit for that town ? And in his wrath he ordered that the Spanish prisoners be hanged and cast back into the sea . For three days after this , the men said , Raleigh kept to his cabin in an extreme melancholy , but at last he came forth , saying he prayed that if we returned 142 1 GOLDING 'S TALE  | with sufficient gold he might make his peace with the King even now and perhaps save his head . Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave him good hope , he said , for it was evident that they had found the mine and remained in order to work it until the latest possible time . Less than a fortnight after this Griffiths appeared in his pinnace with the news that we had found no mine . The Admiral at first accused him of telling an idle tale to cover his own desertion , threatening to hang him on the spot as a traitor or else surely to hang him afterwards if he spoke false . But by stages Griffiths convinced him that what he said was true , relating our melancholy adventures at such length as the Admiral could see they were no tale , and thus Raleigh came to understand that he was without question a ruined man . But one thing Griffiths omitted from his narrative : he could not bring himself to tell Raleigh that his son was dead . The next day arrived the men of Keymis 's pinnace , who had fled their master after the rains began , and they were a brazen rabble of liars , for to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one of them even told how he had seen him killed , swept away by the current and drowned . I suppose they thought we should never return to contradict them , as how would they otherwise dare to be so bold ? Raleigh , however , believed their tale , and he said it was for the best MARK ROSE 143  | that way , for Keymis had ruined him and he had no wish to see him again . But then he asked how his son Wat fared , and they looked at him astonished , for did he not know , they said , that Wat had been killed long before in the fight at San Pedro ? Hearing this , Raleigh sat stunned , and then , all his senses overmastered with these news , lay down and wept for near an hour in all which time he was inconsolable , until presently coming to himself again , he desired that they tell him the whole manner of Wat 's death . But the ignorant mariners disagreed upon this , for one said that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another said it had been within the town , and a third that it had been at our own camp , and thus they fell to debating amongst themselves . Whereupon Raleigh , growing wroth , accused them of making a tale to give him pain , and indeed , he said , he even doubted that Wat was dead . The mariners , however , swore it was no tale , and they told how Keymis had buried him under the altar of the church at San Pedro . Once again Raleigh wept until , drying his eyes , he looked at those standing very grave about him and asked was he then to go from the world and leave nothing behind him ? He had forgotten , he said , that he had more to lose , and he feared that even now there might be something more that he could not bring to mind . Then he requested that Captain Griffiths be brought to 144 1 GOLDING 'S TALE  | him and it came out that Griffiths had disguised the truth about Wat , for which Raleigh generously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew of the matter , which he did , Raleigh listening in silence like a man in a trance . Two days later Keymis and I arrived on my barge . Wounded as he was , the moment Keymis saw Raleigh he fell upon his knees and begged not for mercy , he said , but for his old friend 's private pardon , swearing that all his life he had had no purpose but faithful service to him and that Raleigh must believe he had done naught amiss from ill meaning . The Admiral replied that he knew not what Keymis meant , but that for his own part he had had good hope that he was dead and had not thought ever to behold him again in the world . To which Keymis , still on his knees , answered that these words grieved him more than his failure , as for himself he had had no further desire than to find his master alive and in good health . " Why what should health matter to me who must shortly be condemned to die on account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said nothing but looked most wretchedly at him . Whereupon Raleigh turned his back and stared out to sea , as if he would rather behold that emptiness of water than Keymis 's face . Without waiting for any command to do so , Keymis began an impassioned narrative of the  | expedition , telling how we had been plagued with difficulties and shortages of provision , at one point reduced to living , he said , almost upon acorns and the bark of trees . He said that what with the woods so thick that to advance a mile was a day 's labor , and the hills so high , and everywhere savages who shot at us from the trees so they could not be seen , what with all of these , he did not believe Raleigh or any man else could have found that mine that they had not seen in twenty years . As for the Spanish town , he said , that was more Wat Raleigh 's doing than his own . But here the Admiral cut Keymis short , saying he had heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Raleigh began to cry out against Keymis , cursing him for a traitor , accusing him of willfully disobeying every one of his commands , asking where he found the boldness to return after disgracing himself so . At last , passing his hand over his eyes , he said that Keymis was and always had been a mere timeserver , no friend but a parasite that he long ago ought to have plucked from his heart . Keymis , seeing that Raleigh had grown to him a scorpion , was near distracted at these words and he knelt and swore by God almighty that it was not so , that he had never been false . But Raleigh would not hear him , demanding instead to know why , the town being sacked , Keymis had abandoned the search for the mine , sailing 146 GOLDING 'S TALE  | upriver after he knew not what . Why had he not looked in the region he knew the mine to be ? Keymis began to frame an answer but then faltered . His mouth opened but he had nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fool as to think he would discover gold among a crew of fleeing Spaniards ? Had he perhaps thought he might track down and slay every one of those Spaniards to cover the crime at San Pedro ? Indeed , had he thought at all or had he wholly lost the use of reason ? Shaking all over , Keymis replied that he had faithfully looked upon every mountain and it was not there , and he told how the country had seemed to melt and change with likely places everywhere and nothing certain and no secure place that he might recognize although he searched everywhere until the men began to doubt there was any mine at all and he himself wondered whether he and Raleigh had merely convinced themselves of something that was not there , for indeed he had not discovered even any trace of gold . Was Keymis blind ? cried Raleigh . Did he have no eyes to see ? How could it be that in a country so rich that every stone was either itself a treasure or a perfect witness of treasure growing near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own eyes to ooze gold , to spawn it like the sea breeding fish , in such a country how could it be MARK ROSE 147  | that he should return empty-handed ? Why a child in that country could have gathered in one morning enough treasure to keep him for life . Keymis begged him to believe that he had done his best , that in everything he had acted as he hoped Raleigh himself would have done . If that was all he could say , Raleigh answered , then truly he had lost his wit , and he said that he hoped Keymis might satisfy King James better than he had his Admiral , adding that he did not intend to take his part with the King . To which Keymis replied that he knew then what course to take . Raleigh said he hoped he did and added that for the remainder of the voyage he had assigned him a cabin on The Destiny where he might do as he pleased , but his own galleon , The Good Hope , was to be under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Keymis requested me to assist him to his cabin . But as we left the Admiral 's chamber the common mariners of The Destiny , well understanding that he was out of favor , did not hesitate to jeer , which Keymis disdained to notice , but not so myself who could not bear to be used in such a fashion , wherefore seizing the most offensive among them I thrashed him even there as an example that I was not yet wholly without my authority . Keymis 's cabin , which had formerly belonged to the boatswain 's mate , was a paltry chamber 148 GOLDING 'S TALE  | below the poop , poorer even than that cabin in which I had spent so much time aboard my barge , and no fit lodging for such a man . But he said it mattered not where he lodged , for one place was as good as another to him now , and thus I left him , seated amongst his few books and other possessions , which had already been carried aboard from The Good Hope . I reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear myself so stoical as he , but indeed I had my own complaint against Raleigh , for had not I , both by age and experience , been twenty times more suited to the command of The Good Hope than Griffiths ? It grieved me not a little that I who had been deprived of a galleon no less than he , and through no fault of mine own , should be passed over for him , and solely because I had remained to retrieve Keymis whilst Griffiths had deserted and fled . And should I therefore return to England with no recompense at all for my share in The Fortune ? About this time , I learned , there was a pistol shot heard by those on the poop of The Destiny and the Admiral , suddenly conceiving with dismay that Keymis might have done himself some violence , sent a man to the cabin to investigate ; and yet fortunately , it appeared , the Admiral had been mistaken , for Keymis replied from within that he was merely cleaning his weapons and had fired a pistol that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | received the news much relieved , saying that already he repented some of the things he had spoken to Captain Keymis . Indeed , he said , his conscience pricked him to that extent that perhaps he would descend and speak with Keymis to make him more comfortable in his mind . Going to the cabin , Raleigh called in to Keymis to admit him as he would have a word or two in private , but , there being no reply , he opened the door , and thus he discovered Keymis hanging by a length of ship 's line from the beam in the middle of the chamber . Near distracted with astonishment and grief , Raleigh cried out for help , whereupon several mariners came running and together they cut down the body still warm and lay it upon the bunk ; and now they perceived there was a wound upon the left side near the heart , for he had first attempted to shoot himself but the ball had glanced off a rib . On the bunk they found a letter addressed to King James in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking upon himself all the blame both for the sack of San Pedro and the failure to find the mine , and begging the King to pardon Raleigh for what had not been his fault . It was not likely , the Admiral said , that the King should spare him on account of a dead man 's letter ; nevertheless , he folded it for safekeeping and put it in his purse . After this Raleigh retired to his cabin very  | grim , giving orders that none should disturb him that night . What thoughts he may have had I can not say , but Griffiths and myself , perceiving how he took Keymis 's death to heart and fearing lest in his despair he should pursue the same course , posted a guard of mariners before his cabin with instructions that if they heard any sound they were to break open the door , and no matter what the Admiral commanded they were not to let him do himself violence . But the men heard no sound all night , except it were Raleigh pacing the floor from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , very surprised that his cabin had been watched all that time , for he was not yet ready , he said , to seek such desperate means to disburden himself . And now Raleigh gave orders for Keymis to be buried honorably and as a soldier upon a small island lying to one side of the river mouth ; and he commanded that we should use all the proper rites of burial , notwithstanding the manner in which Keymis died , and all this was done even as Raleigh ordered it . The body was washed and annointed with spices and oils and then dressed in fresh garments especially prepared as a shroud . They fastened his hands about a silver cross that was Raleigh 's own , and upon his breast they sprinkled a pinch of wheat grain to flower as a sign of the resurrection to come . Thus arrayed , they lay him upon a  | board , painted all black for a bier , and sewed him into the banner taken from The Good Hope , Keymis 's own colors , being a field of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tail about the golden head of a wild boar with fierce tusks . But when this was done , the Admiral came in , bearing a banner of his own colors that had been Wat Raleigh 's , and this they sewed onto Keymis 's own banner in such a fashion that both emblems showed . We buried Keymis in the afternoon , carrying the bier to the island in the longboat from The Destiny , attended by thirty pikemen all in black , and Raleigh himself , dressed in half armor , rode with the bier . In the second longboat were forty other men , mariners and musketeers , and each of these wore something of black about him . The two galleons we sailed as near to the island as we dared , and all those who were not able to go upon the longboats stood on the hatches to watch . The day was gray and damp , with heavy clouds hanging low in the heavens , and just as we landed upon the island a fine rain commenced . Eight men from The Good Hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Raleigh marched before them with Keymis 's casque in his hands , and every man carried a palm leaf or one of cassava in place of rosemary or yew as they are not to be found in that country . We buried him upon a gentle rise facing east , 152 GOLDING 'S TALE  | looking out towards Trinidados and the sea . But in the digging of the grave the men came upon the bones of a savage , and thus we found this island to be an ancient burying place and Keymis was to lie surrounded by savages . The grave being dug and the body placed therein , the Admiral read the service over him , and then , before he was covered , Raleigh took the sword that had been his son 's and this he put into the grave alongside him , and he spoke a brief prayer for the repose of Wat 's spirit as well as Keymis 's . Then each man passed by , casting in the leaf he bore , whether of cassava or palm , after which the moist earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set a small cross of wood painted white , but at the feet was put a pike and on it Keymis 's casque that he had worn in battle , there to stay and rust in the dampness of the air . And now the soldiers discharged their pieces , and this was a sign to those upon the galleons who fired the cannons one by one until all had been discharged .  | The following day Raleigh gave a command that caused a great stir amongst the men , the most part of whom had judged that our misfortunate voyage was now , perforce , come to an end , and that they must shortly return to England with no more than scars to show for their pains . He ordered that the pinnaces he made ready to journey home , and on these were to sail all those who were ill or otherwise unapt for hard fighting at sea ; but the sound men and the hearty were to remain behind upon The Good Hope and The Destiny , and to these he promised one more attempt at fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal , but there was no doubt among the compa- vies that what he intended was to turn pirate , and this new prospect the men apprehended with great joy as a sure mean to profit with little risk , for as to the risk of hanging , they were many of them under jeopardy already for such crimes as they had committed in England and this was the very reason they had signed for Raleigh 's voyage . Moreover , they did not doubt that with Raleigh in command The Destiny and The Good Hope should outrun any warship upon the seas . And now there was much bruit and speculation aboard the vessels , for some said he meant to lay off Newfoundland for the fishermen and fur traders there , but others contended he meant to prey upon the silk and spice merchants of the East , and still a third party held it was the Mediterranean was his goal . It required several days to ready the pinnaces and determine who was to depart and who to remain , for many who were feeble or wounded or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some we had to remove from the galleons by force as Raleigh had commanded that none such were to be allowed to stay on account of their being a hindrance and a let . But at last the two small vessels sailed , as pitiful a crew of the sickly and maimed as ever set out upon such a voyage and God alone knew if there was a single man amongst them of sufficient strength to hold the helm in a storm . The Admiral now summoned Griffiths and myself to come to him in his cabin , where , seating  | us upon chairs , he strode back and forth very agitated . Well , he said presently , we must realize that , as matters now lay , he could not return to England , wherefore he had determined , he said , upon a plan that was bold and venturesome as any ever conceived and like to bring us all royal wealth if it succeeded . And what he meant to do , he said , was to attack the Spanish treasure fleet when it set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold and silver from all America . Griffiths and I were astonished , but Raleigh laughed and asked had we , like the men , thought he meant to turn pirate ? Why , said he , I am no thief to prey upon the substance of merchantmen and traders , adding that , desperate as he was , he had still some conscience about him , being not yet of the same mind as his mariners , who would not scruple to cozen their brothers to satisfy their lusts . Griffiths protested that this was no time for talk of conscience when the plain fact was that we were ruined men unless we pursued some reasonable course . As for this plan of the treasure fleet , he said , it was mere fancy and dream , for that fleet would have a score of vessels well armed , and ourselves but two galleons with scarce three hundred men . Why , said Raleigh , he had not brought so many men such a distance merely to plunder a few cargoes of fish and furs , and he charged Griffiths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ambition was no more than a heap of her 156 GOLDING 'S TALE  | rings . Indeed , he said , to be such a pirate was but to be in a manner a fishwife or grocer . Griffiths replied that Raleigh was unjust , for there was much good profit to be made that way , and in a few months labor we might bring forth some thousands of pounds if we were fortunate . But Raleigh laughed at Griffith 's thousands . Why , the treasure fleet was millions and all in massy gold , enough to make our mariners rich , ourselves earls and dukes , and King James an emperor . Now here was a thing indeed worth some labor . Here was treasure to which a monarch might aspire . Here was virtue , fame , honor , and all things else , for he that might take the treasure fleet would be accounted the greatest man in the world , the noblest and most daring , and he would be celebrated like a god . In this manner Raleigh continued for some time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed he was like a poet or seer , rapt from himself by the beauty of what he saw . But Griffiths interrupted , asking how this might be done with two galleons alone ? Why , said Raleigh , it would be a notable achievement , perilous for certain , and yet not impossible , for we should have in our attack the virtue of absolute surprise . Nor should we suppose that all the armada would be galleons , for , on the contrary , the most part would be carracks of no worth in a fight . As for the galleons , of which we might expect six or seven , we must bear in mind how much more cumbersome than our own the  | Spanish ships were . Moreover , these vessels would be heavily laden , so crammed with wealth that , like gluttons after a feast , they should be sluggish and lazy , wherefore we should have great natural vantage . He reminded us that he had already proven The Good Hope and The Destiny superior in battle to five Spanish men of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven , especially if such vast riches were at stake ? Well , I said , the plan was desperate but not entirely unreasonable ; but Griffiths said no , it was as impossible as ever , for no magic could charm away the fact that there were but two of us and a score of them . And even if the odds were less desperate , there was the quality of our mariners to consider , for they should no sooner discover the Admiral 's intention than they would rise up to prevent it , and Raleigh knew this well , he said , else why had he given them to believe he meant to turn pirate ? Seeing Griffiths unmoved , Raleigh grew angry , saying he believed the men were not half so fearful as Griffiths himself , and indeed it was clear that he was simply afraid to face the Spaniard , being too little of spirit to apprehend any great thing . To which Griffiths replied that truly he was afraid of attacking an armada , which seemed to him mere prudence , for to plunge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said Raleigh , he had not summoned us for our opinions but to inform us of his course , and if it liked Griffiths not , then I should take  | command of The Good Hope in his stead . Griffiths looked grave , but presently replied that if the Admiral was determined then clearly we must do it , and furthermore , he said , he must do it with a will , wherefore he pledged that as for himself he would not be behindhand in the fighting when it came . And now Raleigh clapped him on the shoulder , saying these words made him glad , for he knew Griffiths to be a good commander and he believed the men would follow wherever he led . But when we had left the Admiral and Griffiths and myself were alone , he suddenly burst out in a passion against Raleigh , which I marveled to behold , as just before he had spoken him so fair . He exclaimed that Raleigh was like a baited bear , desperate enough to try any wild shift to preserve his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was determined upon this impossible folly of the treasure fleet in a vain hope to escape hanging ? He was a doomed man and if we followed him now he would lead us all to our deaths . I replied that perhaps this was so , and yet it was but partial truth , for I believed we might truly accomplish it , wherefore I advised him rather to think of the riches to be got than any other thing , and so I bade him good night . That same night , as we later learned , Griffiths called together the company of The Good Hope and describing what the Admiral intended , he put it to them whether they wished to stay with Raleigh or follow himself and turn pirate , and there  | was not a man among them who did not choose to go with Griffiths , wherefore , the next morning before dawn , The Good Hope drew anchor and departed , running very quick before the wind . Seeing her sails go up and receiving no answer to their shouts , for Griffiths had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the watch upon The Destiny hastened to rouse the Admiral and myself , and yet even before we reached the hatches , The Good Hope was under way , cutting a wide swath through the luminous sea . In the half-light before dawn , the departing vessel was like a pale ghost ship fleeing the sun about to rise . When he understood what had occurred , Raleigh commanded the watch to summon the mariners , whom he addressed , saying that their companions upon The Good Hope were cowards and had played them all false . And yet it was not the men who were so much at fault as Captain Griffiths , he said , for he was a mere traitor and scoundrel . And if we were yet in any way to thrive and be fortunate , he said , we must recover that vessel , as without her we might do naught , wherefore the future of every man aboard depended wholly upon our securing The Good Hope . Moreover , he pledged that no one of the company of that ship would be punished for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanged for a traitor and his body cast into the sea . Raleigh bestirred the men to great passion . In haste the anchor was hauled aboard , the sheets unfouled , and the sails raised , and just as day was  | dawning , we commenced our pursuit . But such a day it was as might give hope to no enterprise of moment , for the heavens were all occluded with gray , surging clouds , very low above us , driven by the wind . By this time Griffiths was perhaps a league off . Moreover , the wind being passing strong and The Good Hope the heavier vessel although somewhat broader in the beam , she was able , so long as she held direct before the wind , to keep her lead , and this even though we clapped on every rag and tatter of sail we possessed . All our men were upon the hatches and many had climbed into the shrouds , the better to see what advance we were making upon them , but so long as the wind held steady we made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind commenced to come in gusts , more uncertain than before , for first she would blow from the northwest and then from the north , and then again , on the sudden , would come a sportive gust from the east . And now , in these wayward airs , we were able to draw upon them in spurts , and each time a gust came , the men made a great cheer , but although we advanced upon them by degrees we did not do so in any constant fashion , wherefore in above an hour we drew closer by perhaps a quarter of a league and no more . Towards midmorning , however , the wind commenced to blow steadily from the north , so that Griffiths had no shift but to come athwart it , losing his advantage , or be dashed upon the coast ,  | and now we gained upon him rapidly , The Destiny being much the better vessel upon such a tack . About this time , the heavens began to flash with great sheets of lightning and the thunder to roar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet the rain held off and did not fall . Within an hour we came alongside , our men crying out for them to strike their sails and lay to for us to board , but to the mariners ' amazement , the answer they received was a broadside from The Good Hope 's culverins and a volley of chain shot besides . The men were confused and dismayed , for why should their own companions fire upon them in such a fashion ? Furious , Raleigh commanded our ordnance to be prepared , and this the men performed , although reluctantly , for they had no relish for such a fight . But Raleigh ordered that The Good Hope was not to be allowed to flee , and if they fired again , we were to respond in kind , taking care , however , not to damage the ship in any serious fashion . Moreover , if any man caught sight of Griffiths he was free to shoot him down if he could do so , and Raleigh promised that he would be richly rewarded . And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and when they fired , we replied with a light cannonade . But they had struck us with a volley of chain shot , bringing down our foremast , and three of our men were killed , one by the mast itself and two others by becoming entangled in the shrouds and drawn over the side .  | The men were maddened , seeing that three of their companions had been killed , wherefore they fired a heavy volley of shot , driving a great ball through her port and into her hold . Raleigh cried out for the men to be more prudent , and yet in the confusion his commands went unheeded , for Griffiths 's men , being determined to be free , hurled volley after volley upon us , as we upon them in reply , and , although some of the balls fell short on account of the pitching of both vessels being so great , nevertheless those that did land wrought much damage and that upon either side . And now Raleigh saw that unless we might grapple with them and conquer them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good Hope would be lost and perhaps The Destiny as well , wherefore he commanded that the irons be brought forth and affixed to the yardarms for that purpose , to draw them to us , and , coming in very close upon their port side , which was indeed a great peril , we strove to catch our irons in their shrouds . To discourage us in this attempt Griffiths had stationed musketeers upon both the fore- and aftercastles of his ship , and each time we approached , these opened fire directly upon our men . Upon the second pass we succeeded ; and a great cry went up among our mariners for their companions upon The Good Hope to cease their fire , but this cry was lost in a crash of thunder from the heavens . Moreover , as the men were climbing upon the rails , there came a huge surg- ing of the sea , wherefore our vessels were thrust one upon the other with a splintering and shattering of timbers together with the fearful shrieks of those who found themselves unluckily between the bulwarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or otherwise piteously maimed . But now the ships holding alongside each other , and their musketeers firing and some of our own as well , a great many men upon either side fell . Furthermore , a number of our mariners having got from our vessel to theirs , where there was much disorderly fighting with broadswords and pikes , the musketeers could no longer distinguish between our company and the other , but merely fired at large onto the hatches , more out of a fearful passion than for any reasoned purpose . Upon our own hatches , too , there was fighting now , and that at times amongst our own company , for no one might tell of a certainty who was of Raleigh 's party and who of Griffiths 's , wherefore upon that occasion every man possessed of a pistol or sword became a present peril and a foe . Each man 's ambition was but to preserve his own life while others were falling about him , and to this end he would fight with any man who came him nigh . The sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence heaved them apart , but our grappling hooks being entangled in their shrouds and sails , those that were fallen with the cutting off of their masts , came away bearing 164 GOLDING 'S TALE  | both canvas and line , together with pieces of the mast , so that their sails flapped against our sides like the broken wings of a bird . And now our cannoneers began once again to bombard them . Indeed The Good Hope had by now begun to list somewhat to port where her bulwark had been shattered , wherefore Raleigh commanded that the firing stop , although he might by then as soon have commanded the thunder to cease , so little was his order attended or even heard . About this time the rain , which all morning had threatened , began to fall in earnest , flooding the hatches , the water mingling with the blood of the slain and wounded , so that all the vessel ran with vermilion and each drop as it fell was dyed the color of the rest . Moreover , we were pitching worse than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dashed upon the sea , wherefore many men , both living and dead , were most violently thrown into the waters . And now we beheld a fearful thing , for there appeared in great numbers those sharks that infest that region and these , rushing and plunging , began to make a feast of our companions in the waters . The Good Hope was now declined to that degree on account of the fight and the storm together , and it could not be but she must shortly give way entirely and sink , and indeed the men upon her had already begun to leap into the sea , their swords in their hands , in a desperate shift to preserve their lives , choosing rather to combat the sharks than to remain aboard her any longer  | and be trapped as she went down . There must have been a hundred souls thrashing in the water in the confusions of the storm and the wind and the crying and shouting from all directions , and the sharks , driven mad by the surfeit of blood , were attacking each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea between the two vessels was boiling with sharks and men and blood . And now The Good Hope , her aftermast level to the water , lay entirely upon one side , like a great fallen beast , after which the sea opened and with a noise like sucking swallowed her , and thus she went down . Those that we could we plucked from the sea , and many that we preserved had lost arms and legs or were otherwise maimed . But although we saved a fair number , Griffiths himself was not among them and it must have been that he was either slain in the fighting or drowned or eaten by the sharks , and Raleigh was pleased because he said he had deserved no less . From the men they rescued the mariners learned what had been the origin and cause of all these troubles , namely that Raleigh had deceived them , never having in fact intended to turn pirate as they thought . And now the men , being exceedingly wroth at having been gulled in this fashion , swore that they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they cursed us both for liars and cozeners , saying that all along the men had been led astray and cheated by the masters and it was clear that there would be no thriving until we were dead and cast into the sea 166 1 GOLDING 'S TALE  | and the ship was their own . In this wrathful spirit , their weapons in their hands , a party of the boldest made for us upon the poop , and yet they did not come upon us with caution , in which manner they had certainly taken us , but being leaderless and too passionate besides for the making of any plan , they merely rushed the poop , their muskets firing , shouting that we were to be hanged . Seeing them come and understanding at once that they were too many for us to fight , Raleigh and I fled together to the armory chamber beneath his cabin . To this chamber there were two entrances or portals , the one by a trap descending from the cabin and the other by a narrow companion , admitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarded the trap whilst I fronted the companion , leaving the door open that we might have some light in the chamber , for there was neither port or opening , the armory being of a purpose in the bowels of the ship where no cannon shot of any enemy might easily penetrate . I stood just within the door , and as soon as the men appeared I fired both my pistols into their midst and then charged forward , my sword flying and shouting terribly as if I were twenty men and not one , for I was desperate , and above all I feared that they might fire upon us with their muskets and thus perchance strike one of the powder butts that lay in the chamber . So fiercely did I attack that they fled from the companion , whereupon I immediately flung to the door , having thus shown  | them that we intended to fight for our lives and did not mean so easily to yield to their rebellion . But when they were gone and the companion closed , Raleigh bade me be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us were killed , the other was dead as well . And thus Raleigh and I , like rats in a hole , waited in darkness , he at the trap and I at the companion , for the mariners ' next assault . Above us in the cabin we could hear running feet and cries , but what was proceeding we could not say . For many hours we waited , fearing even to sit lest the men take us unprepared , and yet in all this time there came no further attack or assault . Towards evening we became , both of us , exceeding hungry and even weak with want of food , as we had neither of us eaten a morsel that day . Nevertheless , we did not dare to venture forth in search of victuals that night . At last famine yielded to weariness , wherefore we agreed to watch and rest in shifts , the one to wake the other in case of need , and in this fashion we passed the remainder of that night . In the morning there came the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for whoever was there to stand . The reply was that they were a deputation of three mariners who would speak to us on behalf of the men , and they swore they were weaponless and intended us no harm . With great caution lest it be a ruse or trick , we admitted them , the light streaming into the chamber and dazzling us as we opened the  | door . But Raleigh pledged them that if they attempted to seize us or in any other way to play us false , he would not hesitate to fire the powder butts , thereby assuring that we should all be destroyed together . What had happened , as we learned from these men , was that the mariners had fallen out amongst themselves upon what course to follow , for , whereas the one part desired to slay us and turn pirate , and these were mostly those who on account of their former crimes feared returning to England , a second part , no less numerous than the first , professed themselves weary of fruitless adventuring , for they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these were thankful at least to have preserved their lives , wherefore now they wished nothing more than to be brought home . But whether Raleigh would consent to this they did not know , as they understood that for him to return would be dangerous . And what of those who wished to turn pirate , Raleigh asked , how were they to be contented with returning to England where they stood in equal peril with himself ? The men replied that it was agreed between them that we should make first for Ireland where any who wished might debark , and Raleigh himself might pursue this course if he believed that in Ireland he would be safe . But the Admiral shook his head and said that he was no common mariner that he might simply disappear , for indeed he was as well known in  | Ireland as anywhere else . And then he sighed and passed his hand over his eyes and said that well , he believed he was upon any account a dead man , and why should he not do as they asked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by forfeiting his own life he would preserve those of others . All along , he swore , his concern had been solely for the commonwealth of them all . Others had acted upon private and selfish reasons , but never himself , and why should it be any different now ? In such a vein he went on , impressing them how he was making a noble sacrifice for their sakes , and with his words they were all much affected . We went above now to the poop , where we beheld the melancholy condition of the ship . The foremast was down and hung over the side , like a branch ripped from a tree in a storm . All upon the starboard side and especially about the waist the timbers were crushed and broken from when the sea had thrown us against The Good Hope . The sails hung in tatters , both from the storm and some of them from where they had been struck by balls . All the hatches were littered with debris , shattered timbers , broken weapons , shreds of sail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there still lay about the hatches the bodies of some of those who had fallen , and these were most gruesome and unpleasant to behold . Evidently the ship had been let to run free all night with no man either at the watch or the helm , and so now the Admiral ordered our position to be determined , and the hatches to be  | cleared , and as much of the damage to be repaired as might conveniently be done at sea and was necessary for our voyage home . The position being taken , we found we were some twenty leagues above Trinidados , the current and the storm together having thus started us upon our way home . The clearing of the decks took the most part of that day and the mending of the sails and sheets required three more , but when this was done and the main timbers either shored or repaired and the foremast replaced , we set out in earnest for home . The night that we reached the trades and therefore might count ourselves once again upon the open sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserved me through so many trials and shifts . For had not I seen many hundred men fall to fever and fighting and confusion ? And had not I seen not the Admiral alone , but Keymis and Wat Raleigh and Griffiths as well , utterly destroyed ? And I swore now that if only I were permitted to reach England without further mishap , I would never again go adventuring for either gold or silver or anything else of value .  | For above ten days we had excellent breezes , fair skies , and gentle seas , wherefore in this time we made better than five hundred leagues , bringing us to the region of the Canaries , whence we proceeded north along the coasts of the Moorish countries and then of Portugal and Spain , keeping well away from land , however , lest we should be in any sort espied . This fact was notable about our return journey , that whereas upon our voyage westward toward Guiana nature herself had conspired against us with storms and calms and every other let and delay in her power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , now , upon our return , she assisted us in every way , so that the identical journey in 172 GOLDING 'S TALE  | the opposite direction was accomplished in under one month . During this time I held much private converse with the Admiral , who confided to me how he had secretly thought to establish a vast empire in Guiana , a commonwealth of all the savage nations , who with his aid would rise up to drive the Spaniard from the New World , a thing he believed might have been done with much more ease than was generally supposed . James would have become an emperor and himself regent of America , ruling from a glittering palace on the Orinoco , the walls of which should be all of white marble such as was to be found in the regions south of the river , and the floors to be nothing but massy inlaid gold , a testimony and emblem of the richness of that country and its peoples . But now all his hopes had come to naught and even his very life must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he , there was perhaps one last means for him to preserve his life if nothing more , but to do this he must secure my help , wherefore he must believe I loved him even as I said , for if I did not he was entirely lost . His plan was to escape to Ireland , there to live with certain of his friends , Sir Robert Kimborough and his family , as quietly as might be . But if he was to be safe , no man , and especially none of our company , must understand that he was in that country .  | This was what he had determined . He should , by drinking of a potion of salts compounded from the ship 's stores , bring upon himself such a sweating and vomiting that all men must believe he was deathly ill . After this he would retire to his cabin , refusing to see any man but myself , who should give out that he was ill of the fever , and so for several days I must every day inform the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them he was dead . Meanwhile , he would closet himself in the armory chamber until we reached Ireland where I should secretly deliver him to his friends . Arriving in England , I should report that he had died of the fever , and this , so far as anyone would know , would be his end . As for myself , upon whom all his safety reposed , Raleigh said he would bind me to him with such hoops of self-interest that I should risk nothing but rather greatly profit from this undertaking , for to me he would give as guerdon and reward for my faith , The Destiny herself and all that appertained to her , to dispose of or use howsoever I saw fit for my own benefit . And now he began to speak of what great thrift I might derive from this vessel , using her by way of trade as an armed merchantman , for , being so stout a man of war , she had naught to fear from pirates and might venture even the most perilous and therefore profitable routes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divers other rich goods with such certainty of success as no other 174 1 GOLDING 'S TALE  | bottom might claim , wherefore I should , in but a few years , grow as great in wealth as any Venetian magnifico , and he doubted not that in ten years ' time I would have not one vessel only but a score or more of carracks , galleons , and pinnaces , mine own argosies and armadas , sprung all from the fruitful womb of The Destiny . Raleigh 's imaginings for myself naturally kindled my spirit , but how , said I , were the men to believe him dead , never having seen his body ? He replied that this was a matter he had considered and provided for , but first he had wished to gain my consent to his scheme . And now he led me to the trap , where , descending by a ladder to the armory , he revealed , hidden behind a butt , a young mariner 's corpse , which had evidently lain there for some time as it had commenced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man had been wounded in the fight with The Good Hope and died sometime thereafter , and this corpse , he said , we should decorate and enshroud as if it were his own and bury it at sea with as much pomp and ceremony as possible so the men might have no doubts . As for the stench , he said , it would be less evident upon the hatches in a fair breeze than in so confined a chamber as the armory , and indeed he did not believe the mariners would be sensible of it at all . This agreement we concluded upon the seven- teenth day of our voyage , being then somewhere off the coast of Spain . Upon the nineteenth day , at midmorning , the hatches then being crowded with mariners , Raleigh drank off the potion he had prepared and walked about the poop , waiting for it to take effect . After some ten minutes or so he began to sweat , whereupon he descended from the poop onto the hatches where the men were most gathered , making a show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waist . But now his face was become all purple and rotten in patches , and he stumbled upon a coil of line , whether through craft or weakness I can not say , for immediately he commenced a great vomit , together with such a pitiful moaning and heaving about of his arms and legs as if he were like to die within the hour . The men hurried about him , gaping to see their Admiral lying upon the common hatches , and some said that he was dead , but then he began to groan and vomit once more and the men stepped back , fearing lest it be the fever that had reappeared amongst us in this manner . Approaching now , I knelt by his side and inquired how he did , but he , moaning and flailing his arms , gave no reply , and indeed he appeared so ill that for the moment I feared he might be truly dying , the potion having proved more poisonous than he had judged . But then , very weak , he caught hold of my arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a position half sitting and half lying , in a choking voice asked that I bring him to his cabin . I called out for help to carry the Admiral and when none came forward I feigned great anger , saying they were worse than beasts to refuse to aid a sick man , but indeed I wished more to stir up their fears than their charity and so I took care to remind them how mortal the fever was and how painful a death , all the while seeming to ask them to take pity upon their commander . At last I plucked two quaking fellows from the group , and ordering one to carry the feet and the other the head , I saw Raleigh conveyed to his cabin and laid upon the bunk . The two mariners I dismissed and so anxious were they to be gone that they fairly fell upon each other in their departure and I believe that they reckoned themselves already dead men . The morning Raleigh drank the potion we were , as we judged , about three days ' sail from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his affliction was without doubt the fever and that he was , moreover , as fiercely ill as any I had seen . The following morning I gave out that he was worse , having fallen , I said , into a kind of delirium or dream , speaking disconnectedly of gold and empires and I knew not what else . But all this time Raleigh was in fact quite comfortable in his cabin with the ports closed that none might peer in , and he occupied himself with composing a let- ter that I should carry to his wife in London . In the afternoon I came before the men once more and told them that I believed the Admiral was near death , for his flesh had grown all cold , I said , and now he but lay upon his back , scarce breathing , his eyes open and staring but neither beholding nor speaking aught . And this piteous report I delivered with such tears in my eyes and such seeming passion as I might have been any actor upon the stage . At last in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before if it were possible , and said that Raleigh was dead , describing how for two hours I had watched next his body and there had been no movement until just before sunset when there came , I said , a sudden shuddering of the limbs , whereupon I looked up and called out his name and he was wholly still , so that I might see now that the spirit had separated from the flesh . The men wished to have the corpse thrown overboard at once on account of its being infected , but I chided them for this , asking was it fitting that such a man as Raleigh be buried huggermugger with no ceremony , impressing upon them his former greatness and importance ; and in this fashion I bestirred them to some sorrow , so that , although they were determined to be rid of him that night , nevertheless they consented to my preparing it in a military manner . I returned to Raleigh , informing him that all 17 1 GOLDING 'S TALE  | went well and the funeral was to be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young mariner 's body and doused it with wine to cover the smell as best we could , and although this mariner was shorter by a head than Raleigh we trusted that in the darkness he would pass . We sewed the body in the Admiral 's colors , taken from the mast , tying upon it for a further credence Raleigh 's own sword with its hilt of silver chased with gold , a thing with which he was exceedingly loath to part . And now we placed this corpse we had made upon a plank with a taper at each end and lay it upon the floor . Next Raleigh descended below to the nest he had prepared for himself in the armory , a kind of pallet bed , hidden behind the butts upon the other side of the chamber from where the body had been , and here he was provided with water and biscuit and whatever else might be needful for several days ' confinement , including a quantity of phosphorus and tapers for light , although these he was reluctant to employ on account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my securing of the trap once more , he was left both solitary and in entire darkness , as in a kind of grave within the bowels of the ship and one which did truly smell of death ; however , so far from being melancholy , he was in excellent spirits , the plan having worked so well to this point . Raleigh being secreted , I led into the cabin four  | mariners , who , taking hold of the plank , carried it out upon the poop and thence down to the hatches at the waist . It was a moonless night and I greatly feared the men might stumble with their burden , especially upon the ladder , wherefore I bade them take care in the descent , reminding them of the unseemliness if anything untoward should occur . At the waist the ship 's company were assembled , bearing torches , and here I ordered the men to rest the end of the plank upon the bulwark and stand whilst I attached to the body two sixteen-pound balls that it might sink without delay . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit , speaking to them of the Admiral 's greatness and worth , his gallantry and bravery in the most desperate situations , and his noble frankness with even the meanest of wretches , for he had possessed a soaring spirit , I said , and yet at the same time a humility and honesty rarely seen and much to be admired . I reminded them , too , that his entire care had been the common prosperity of us all , which , if he had not achieved it , he was nevertheless not to be blamed for the failure so much as praised for the attempt . And thus I made them a very good speech , fashioning myself to such a show of grief that there was no man in that audience who did not suppose I was in good earnest . After this I read the prayer book to them and then ordered the straps removed and the near end  | of the plank raised , whereupon the body slipped easily over the side , disappearing into darkness before it reached the water . And now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in salute , the balls hurled into the emptiness of the sea . The following morning I raised my colors upon the mast and ordered that the Admiral 's cabin be thoroughly aired and scrubbed , and so I took command of The Destiny as mine own . That evening , just before dark , we sighted a beach and it was Ireland , whereupon the men gave a great cheer , especially those who were to remain there , but indeed we were all heartened to behold so pleasant a sight after months of difficulties , hardships , and misfortunes , for it had been almost entirely a year now since we had first set sail with such hopeful expectations of Guiana . All that night we proceeded along Saint George 's Channel until shortly after dawn we reached our goal , the haven of Kinsall , near where Raleigh 's friends dwelt . It was a fine spring in Ireland . We had become accustomed to the heat and forests of Guiana , but here were gentle airs , a warming sun , and wide grassy fields . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottages were dressed all in yellow with wallflowers upon the roofs and down the sides , the very stones seeming to have burst into bloom . The Irish girls wore chains of daisies in their black hair , and in the midmorning  | they rowed out to where we lay , bringing baskets of round cheeses , honey hives , and jugs of milk . For all this I had no patience . Having grown a superstitious fear both of our voyage and our men , I itched to see Raleigh disposed of and myself back in England , until which I might not feel secure in my possession of The Destiny . I therefore determined to depart upon the morning 's tide and warned the men that any intending to sail for England with me be returned to my ship by sunup at the latest . And then , posting an armed watch lest any of the townspeople be tempted to plunder my vessel 's fittings or stores in my absence , I went ashore to keep my word to Raleigh and make arrangements with his friends . I discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fair manor of white stone , set upon a small hill in a park with an excellent prospect of the sea . Kimborough himself was a courtly gentleman well struck in years , who , when he heard the jeopardy in which Raleigh stood , pledged his life that he would hide his old friend so well that not even the servants should know he was present . Seeing that there was nothing to be done for Raleigh until dark when we might remove him from The Destiny , Kimborough pressed me to remain and dine with his lady and himself , saying it was the least he could do to requite me for the loyal service I had done his friend , but I made my excuses and returned to my  | ship , passing the remainder of the afternoon in reckoning an account of the ship 's provisions that I might know what I possessed . My arrangement with Kimborough was that he should receive Raleigh one hour after dusk behind the church that stood overlooking the harbor . Shortly before this time I called down to Raleigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a space he emerged into the light of my taper and I explained to him the arrangement , whereupon he thanked me for all I had done , saying he doubted not that I should be richly rewarded by the profit The Destiny should bring me , and now he gave me the letter to his lady in which he explained his circumstances and how he lay hidden in Kinsall , together with instructions how she should come to him in secret without imperiling his life . As a final request he bade me deliver this letter as promptly as possible , for he did not relish , he said , that she must pass many days believing him dead when it was not so . The time now being come , we went out upon the poop , taking care lest any mariners be abroad , but the most part of the men were yet ashore wherefore the vessel was almost entirely deserted . Very quietly we descended to the hatches on the starboard side , where Raleigh clasped me by the hand , slipped over the bulwark , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was the last time that I beheld him , either alive or dead . I returned to my cabin and placed Raleigh 's letter with the other valuables in my chest , after which , entering the armory , I took up the blankets and such other articles as he had used there , tying them into a bundle that I threw into the water lest they be discovered at any time and cause suspicion . Some eighty mariners returned to the ship that night , the others having elected to remain in Ireland , and so , shortly after dawn , these eighty and myself , a poor remnant of the nine hundred men and five captains who had made our original company , set sail for home . Of all these many adventurers , both captains and men , only I , by the help of God and the use of mine own wit , had preserved myself and prospered . It was naturally with a certain pride that I regarded my success . We departed from Kinsall on the sixteenth of May . Three days later we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stony coast of Cornwall . At last , on the morning of the 21 May 1618 , exactly eleven months and nine days after we had set out from that same port , we arrived at Plymouth harbor . My first concern was to see the men dispatched , but even whilst this was proceeding there came aboard the sheriff of Plymouth together with a justice of the peace and a gentleman 184 1 GOLDING 'S TALE  | from the court , and they demanded that Raleigh be brought to them as they had papers under the King 's hand for his arrest , the news of his murders and thievery at the town of San Pedro having reached England through the envoy of Spain . I informed these gentlemen that the man they sought was dead and beyond their power , saying they might from any mariner of my ship hear how he had been buried at sea . The sheriff , being much taken aback at these tidings , withdrew to confer with his party , after which he questioned three mariners , who confirmed my tale of Raleigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that while the truth was perhaps as I claimed , nevertheless it might be that the men and myself were in league to hide and protect Raleigh , as it was most likely in so grave a matter a ship 's company , out of mistaken love and loyalty for their commander , should do no less . If this were indeed the case and Raleigh were discovered aboard , it must go hard with me , he promised , when I came before the justice to explain my disloyalty to the King . But if I were frank with him , he could assure me a substantial reward for my service . I made a brave show in scorn of this suspicion , asking did he judge the Admiral such a creeping thing as to conceal himself out of fear of death ? Why he might freely search every hole aboard , where if he found aught of Raleigh I should be  | content to be hanged . But he had far better dredge the seas , I said , for there was more chance of stumbling upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him here . The sheriff naturally searched the ship , and my only fear was lest he come upon the letter hidden in my chest , but , finding nothing , he was constrained to retire ashore , as discontent as any I have seen , for there would have been good profit for him , he said , if he had produced Raleigh according to his commission . But the King would not pay for a dead man at the bottom of the sea . I spent that night solitary upon my ship , where to celebrate my success I had my supper sent by jolly boat from a good inn ashore . For this occasion I put on my best attire and , lighting four tapers , dined in state in my cabin , served by the innkeeper 's son , who reckoned me a very great man thus to feast by myself . I dined upon prawns and pasties together with a bottle of fine canary , all of which I consumed with relish , retiring well satisfied with myself and the world . I was amazed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him the justice , and they had come , he said , to take possession of The Destiny . Upon what authority , I demanded , but even in so dread a fashion as the damned must speak , hearing the everlasting curse pronounced upon them . Why , said he , Raleigh had been adjudged a 186 GOLDING 'S TALE  | traitor , wherefore all his goods must be forfeit to the King . But this was some grievous error , I protested , for The Destiny was mine own , bestowed upon me by Raleigh as he lay dying . She was all the property I had in the world . Perhaps that was so , said he ; nevertheless , this advice he would give me , that , even if I thought the ship mine , I should content myself with my disappointment and not cross the King , for James had long coveted this vessel and he desired it almost as much as Raleigh 's head . Hearing this , I near swooned with passion , for how may a private person contend with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I believe I might have slain this gentleman if I had possessed any weapon to hand . But in truth it was myself I despised , for I understood that Raleigh had once again deceived me with lying promises of fortune . And now I burst into such violent curses of that great charlatan as frightened the gentleman , so that he bade me drink a little brandy to quiet me , for , as he said later , he believed at that moment I should destroy myself with an apoplexy or fit . My senses at length returning , I bethought myself of the letter in my chest , wherefore I inquired of the gentleman the extent of his authority to deal for the King in this matter , as perhaps James would surrender The Destiny for something of  | greater value to him . Upon his making me those assurances I required and placing these in writing under his seal , I requested him to accompany me to my cabin . And there we completed our melancholy business , such as it was , to the great profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never felt the least prick of conscience upon this matter , for to have sacrificed myself at that time for a condemned man and one who had brought so many to destruction would have been but madness . My chief regret was that Sir Robert Kimborough , on account of harboring a traitor , was hanged as well , but this was a consequence I did not foresee . Rather than chastise myself , I thank God that He has seen fit to preserve and prosper me to become the master of a passing rich fleet of armed merchantmen when so many others He has permitted to fall by the way . Some years ago I was told by one who witnessed that event of the Admiral 's remarkable demeanor at his execution , for he ascended the scaffold , my friend said , like a bridegroom to the altar . Standing next to the block , he addressed the crowd gathered to view his death a most eloquent speech in which he gravely refuted all the charges against him , and speaking with such bewitching sweetness that my friend said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how much he ever had envied Raleigh or wished him ill , who was 188 1 GOLDING 'S TALE  | not moved to believe him innocent even as he said . Having concluded speaking , Raleigh removed his black gown , dressed now only in a long shirt like a shroud , which was as white as his hair , so that he looked as if already he belonged more to Heaven than to earth ; whereupon , bowing his head , he blessed them all and said he forgave those that had done him wrong and brought him to this place . Next he desired to be shown the ax , but the gaping headsman being so astonished by this request that he did not move , Raleigh chided him and inquired whether he thought he was afeared . At last , the instrument being given him , he ran his finger along the edge and , smiling , said very loud that it was sharp medicine but a sure cure for all diseases . And then he lay his face upon the block as calmly as it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his best . I do not doubt this tale of Raleigh 's end , for he was a fool and I believe that he had long flattered his vanity with the conceiving of such a spectacle . I trust he enjoyed it , for it was all he had left , but as for myself , I am not so in love with death as that , and you shall never see me stoop to such folly
