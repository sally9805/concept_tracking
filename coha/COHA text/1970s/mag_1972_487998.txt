Miss Greenebaum , a graduate of the Columbia University School of International Affairs , , has been doing ' research on the economics and politics of the Caribbean for the Royal Bank of Canada and other clients . I 'm going to run for re-election on my record in promoting economic development and social justice . ? Gov . Luis Ferre , Partido Nuevo Progresista A democratic government must promote the just distribiltion of wealth and economic opportunities . This task was begun by the Partido - Popular Democratico and obstructed by the government of Senor Ferre . The people of Puerto Rico will resume this effort in 1972 , the year we recapture ' victory . ? Rafael Hernandez ColO , n , President of the Senate and candidate for governor , Partido Popular Democratico We 're offering the people of Puerto Rico the option of independence and a Socialist action program in 1972 . ? Carlos Gallisa , Vice President , Par-tido Independentista Puertorriquefio November 7 is Election Day also in Puerto Rico , where the voters will choose a governor . The election will play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political status is to be commonwealth , statehood or independence . Although status has traditionally been a central question in political discussion on the island , the issue has acquired new intensity as a result of recent action at the United Nations . Last fall the ' Cuban delegation tried unsuccessfully to have Puerto Rico 's status debated by the General Assembly . Then , in late August of this year , the Cubans raised the subject again before the Committee on Colonialism , which adopted a resoludon asserting " the inalienable right ot the people of Plierto Rico to self-determination and independence , " and referred the issue to one of its subcommittees for study . Along with status , the condition of the island 's economy has been a central campaign issue . Experience with the effects of recession and inflation in the United States has made many Puerto Ricans wonder how they might protect themselves from the vicissitudes of the mainland economy . This interest in the island 's economy has provided an occasion to reassess the Puerto Rican Government 's economic and social policies . That reassessment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy of industrialization through tax incentives has remained almost unchanged since it was initiated in the late 1940s . Rapid industrialization indeed has occurred , but the social structure and the distribution of wealth have not changed appreciably . The growth of manufacturing created a middle class of managers and skilled workers , but it remains sandwiched between a small clique of prominent families who control the economic and political power and a mass of unskilled workers , many of them unemployed . In particular , the rural population has been shut out of the recent development , largely because the proverbial multiplier does not multiply in Puerto Rico : industrial wages create a demand for food and consumer goods , but these are then imported from the mainland . Considerably more than three-quarters of the food supply , 60 per cent of consumer goods and most raw materials are imported . In addition , industrialization , haS begun to create environmental problems so serious that the government has embarked on a $200 million program to clean up the island 's water over the next ten years . Automobile congestion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under way . Puerto Rico seems to have acquired the problems of a developed economy without solving those of a developing one . More of tie same will not be enough to deal with present conditions - on the island . So far , however , status has eclipsed all other issues . The question emerged in 1968 , when the Partido Popular Democratico ( PPD ) , which had designed and ' , implemented the idea of commonwealth , was defeated after almost twenty years in office by the partido Nuevo Progresista ( PNP ) , a revitalized and broadened form of they Republican Statehood Party that had traditionally represented a wealthy minority on the island . Paradoxically Luis Ferre the incumbent governor , did not campaign in 1968 on the issue of statehood . Nor has he in , 1972 . He constantly emphasizes that status is a matter " for the people to decide " in a referendum . Yet because of his long identification with the cause of statehood , his mere presence in office is for many people evidence of Puerto Rico 's first step to assimilation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue has consequently become increasingly polarized . Despite what the Governor maintains , status is not apt to be decided in a plebiscite . The referendum held in 1967 showed that 60.4 per cent of the voters favored commonwealth , 39 per cent favored statehood , and 0.6 per cent favored independence . Although the advocates ' of statehood and independence have both gained in number since then , the proportions remain roughly the same . As long as the population is split that way , no political leader in Puerto Rico or in the United States will dare declare the results of a referendum decisive . The future status- of the island will evolve through less obyious measures , such as the present Governor 's attempt to obtain the vote for Puerto Ricans in U.S. Presidential elections . It makes considerable difference , then , whether the governor who is now elected to guide this evolution is an advocate of statehood or commonwealth . Even the Partido Independentista Puertorriqueilo ( PIP ) concedes that the possibility of an independentista governor is extremely remote . That party is striving ! for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that their party , which still controls the Senate , must make a political comeback by capturing the governorship or become politically defunct . Political- support for the idea of commonwealth would die with it . This feeling of " do or die " has spurred the Populares into energetic campaigning . Aside from political controversy , recent incidents have dramatized the inherent awkwardness of the commonwealth status . Negotiations are proceeding over the future use of the island of Culebra off the coast of Puerto Rico where the U.S. Navy 's target practice has aroused widespread protest both on that island and in Puerto Rico . See " Culebra : Island Besieged " by Robert Swann , The Nation , March 1 , 1971 . " We 've reached a satisfactory agreement with the Navy , " the Governor stated in a recent interview . " Culebra is a dead issue , a political mummy . " Yet the following day San Juan newspapers reported that Rep. Herman Badillo was introducing , as an amendment to the Military Construction Authorization bill , an order instructing the Navy to end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Badillo 's action emphasized the fact that Puerto Rico 's resident commissioner in Washington does little more than reside there . He is neither a Congressman nor an ambassador . Perhaps the ultimate irony in the status controversy has been the Young Lords ' opening of branch offices in San Juan and Aguadilla . These , young people have come from east Harlem and the south Bronx to liberate their Puerto Rican brothers , although the Lords ' imperfect knowledge of Spanish sometimes makes it difficult for them to communicate with their brothers . Economically , Puerto Rico faces the same problems that beset the mainland . Inflation , approximately 5 per cent a year according to the Government Planning - Board , is eating into wages . The recent recession was exported to Puerto Rico in the form of factory ' closings and a slump in tourism which contributed to hotel closings . About 9,000 jobs were lost in the shoe industry alone . The peculiarly Puerto Rican indicator , migration to the mainland , showed that after a year of net influx into the island there was once again an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , most of the debate on economic issues is superficial , concentrating on symptoms instead of causes . Critics of the administration attack tlt , competence of the Governor and his staff . " What do you expect from a government of businessmen ? " they ask . What most Puerto Ricans fail to acknowledge is that the island 's most serious economic troubles are not imported from the mainland , and would exist ' regardless of the island 's political status or the booth and slump in the United States . The recent drop in manufacturing employment is trivial when compared to the island 's chronically high unemployment : officially 10 to 12 per cent , but unofficially at least twice that if one inchides those who have given up looking for work and those who are seriously underemployed . , The problem will grow worse , since approximately half the population is still under the age of 20 . The birth rate is a high 2.5 per cent a year , despite incipient efforts at family planning . Similarly , the effects of inflation in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food prices which result from the lack of efficient local suppliers on the island . According to Sen. Justo Mendez , one of the few political leaders who is worried about the future of Puerto ' Rican agriculture , 90 per cent of the food supply is imported . It is amazing to notice that even tropical products come from the outside . Supermarkets in San Juan display cans of pineapple from Hawaii and fresh Sunkist oranges from Florida . The government has stabilized the price of milk at 330 a quart , compared to 290 on the upper East Side pf Manhattan . Eggs are 790 a dozen ; hamburger , 990 a pound . High unemployment and the lack of a local food supply are closely related , since the imbalance between agriculture and industry is at the root of the island 's economic problems . Opportunities for employment in agriculture and food processing are being completely bypassed . Instead , industrial wage earners ' demand for food is creating jobs for farmers in Hawaii , California and Florida . In the industrial sector , furthermore , high . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment the island desperately needs . There is no reason of climate or topography why Puerto Rico can not grow and process a substantial por-tio n of its own food supply . The fact is that since 1950 , when the AdministraciOn de Fomento Economico began to implement the industrial incentives program , the government has concentrated its efforts on aggressive promotion of industry , and allowed laissez , faire to prevail in the rest of the economy . Agriculture stagnated while manufacturing boomed . The ' trouble with Puerto Rican agriculture is that everyone is stuck growing sugar , " states Sen. Miguel Hernandez Agosto , former Secretary of Agriculture . Although two-thirds of the island 's surface is hilly , there are ' some prime lands . Most of thege are devoted to sugar or to nonagricultural uses . This allocation makes little sense , because Puerto Rico is one of the most inefficient sugar producers in the world . Its sugar industry can not compete with either the low-wage areas or the highly mechanized beet production of the industrial countries . Nevertheless , whatever government assistance there has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present administration has launched a $100 million program to save the industry . Although members of the administration point to this program and a similar one for coffee as evidence of an effort to develop agriculture , the assistance is closer to disaster relief than to development . It consists of blank-check subsidies to the growers , the only objective being to preserve jobs in plantations and mills that would otherwise have shut down  --  as some already have . Agriculture lacks prestige because most people can not believe that money might be made by growing things . Consequently , no one will invest to improve productivity or to experiment with crop diversification . Those who own land hold it for its speculative value , not its productive potential . One day they hope to sell it , for housing , factory sites or hotels . Meanwhile , what can be eked out is put into a Swiss bank account , the New York securities market , or the down payment on a new car . ' There have been some isolated exceptiots to this pattern . Libby recently initiated a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formerly part of the Aguirre sugar plantation . But this type of efficient growing of food crops is not going to expand substantially without government incentives of the kind that are now being accorded only to industry . It must be added that the ' U.S. Department of Agriculture , which regards the Caribbean primarily as a market for American farm7 ers , has contributed notably little to the development of Puerto Rican agriculture . Its experimental station at Mayagilez , for instance , is staffed by competent personnel who devote most of their efforts to testing plants that can never be grown in Puerto Rico . The stagnation of agrieulture is the most obvious cause of high unemployment and uneven distribution of incomes , but there is also serious doubt as to the effectiveness of the present industrial incentives program for dealing with these problems . The original aim of the program of tax exemptions for industry was to create jobs . During the 1950s the bootstrap program was highly effective in attracting to Puerto Rico a number of light industries , such as textiles , garments and shoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semiskilled workers . But circumstances have- changed considerably in twenty years . Wages have risen in Puerto ' Rico , - Where the U.S. minimum wage applies , although certain exceptions can legally be made . In addition , the U.S. domestic market for textiles , garments and shoes is collapsing under the competition of foreign imports , so very few of these firms would now be interested in opening plants in Puerto Rico . Only the tax incentives remain : a minimum of ten years and a maximum of seventeen years of complete exemption from corporate , personal and real estate taxes for any firm that will begin manufacturing a product not produced in Puerto Rico before 1947 , when the law was enacted . The incentives , combined with aggressive promotion by the AdministraciOn de Fomento Economico , have in recent years brought to the island a number , of cepital intensive ' industries : petrochemicals , pharmaceuticals , electronics . These provide relatively few jobs , and the jobs they do create are for a restricted group of skilled workers . As it is currently operating , the incentive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phillips Petroleum and ITT more than it is benefiting the people of Puerto Rico . Fomento officials defend the new trend on the grounds that it is attracting more permanent investors than before , providing more jobs than did the garment factories and , above all , creating raw materials that will attract new light manufacturers . There is no guarantee , though , that the accessibility of some raw materials will be sufficient to offset the rise in wages . Nor is it clear that the light manufacturers which Fomento hopes to attract as satellites of the capital intensive industries are currently doing well enough in the United States to want to expand to Puerto Rico , And there are overwhelming environmental considerations which make a large-scale expansion of industry far from the obvious solution to Puerto Rico 's problem . After Singapore and Hong Kong , Puerto Rico is one of the most densely populated areas in the world , with ' more than 800 people per square mile . Prime land must be used selectively . Furthermore , the preservation of/ the quality of the environment is essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because Puerto Rico is at a critical juncture both in its economic development and in determining its political status , it is unfortunate that these basic issues are being evaded . Although there are many critics of the administration 's performance , few people question the basic premises of the development strategy which has been used over the past twenty years . Governor Ferre was elected in 1968 not on his record as one of the chief exponents of statehood , but on his promise to the voters of " La Nueva Vida " ? the ' new life , " Nobody was exactly , sure what the new life was supposed to be . And all we know now is that it never came , " states Rep. Bennie Frankie Cerezo , one Of the organizers of the PNP . Unlike most members of the PNP , Cerezo is deeply concerned with the need for basic social and economic reforms . Most of his colleagues , once in office , seem to have been overwhelmed with the problems of day-to-day governing and to have'lost sight of their original goal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1972 becausL , it has a strong slate and a good program and because the present administration is incompetent , " predicts Jose Enrique Arraras , one of the party 's leaders . His first claim at least is not unfounded . Rafael Hernandez Colon , the party 's candidate for governor and currently President of the Senate , is a man of undeniable ability who established his reputation in Puerto Rican politics as Secretary of Justice while he was still in his 20s . Yet the solutions he offers to Puerto Rico 's problems are not particularly innovative . Both in public statements and in private conversation , he reiterates his faith r. in industrial incentives , believing like most critics of Gov governor Ferre that it has been poorly implemented by the current administration . The activity of the- independence movement is an exception tot the lack of analysis of the basic issues . The independentistas recently sponsored a detailed program , developed by a group of professors at the University of Puerto Rico 's Rio Piedras campus , headed by Milton PabOn , a professor of political science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how the transition . can be made from Puerto Rico 's current economic organization to a completely autonomous Socialist economy . Despite sporadic bombings of department stores by a militant faction of the movement , there is no doubt that a far larger and more moderate section of the movement has been doing serious work both in organizing and in developing a program . Most of thiS group belongs to the PIP , headed by Ruben Berrios and Carlos Gallisa , both - of whom are lawyers . The insurmountable obstacle that the PIP faces is the little support for either ' independence or socialism in Puerto Rico . Although the ranks of the independentistas have grown since the 1967 referendum , almost all political observers agree that the vast majority of Puerto Ricans favor some form of institutionalized association with the United States . Resistance to socialism is even stronger than the ob-. jection to independence . To the middle-class Puerto Rican who is in the process of paying off the mortgage on his house in one of San Juan 's sprawling suburbs and actively contributing to the daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up visions of Fidel confiscating property and forcing middle-class ' Cubans to cut sugar cane . The industrial workers tend to share such views , even though they may not share the affluence . The vast group of poor and unemployed , who might advocate some form of radical social change , has been politically apathetic so far . This group looks to migration to New York as the only way to improve its lot . The prospect for more Rico over the next four years seems to be for more , of the same . The unresolved status issue will continue to monopolize political discussion , while an examination of the island 's fundamental problems is evaded . Unquestioned faith in industrialization as a panacea for the island will ' be maintained while the persistence of glaring social and economic inequities is ignored and the threat to the environment largely unheeded . The traditional formulas are being proved increasingly inadequate , but few people are seriously searching for new ones. , ?                   @ @
