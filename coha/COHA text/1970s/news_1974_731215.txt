txt As Americans sit wearily in mile-long lines at gasoline stations , there are tentative signs of diplomatic movement on the Middle East front . But there is no easing yet of the Arab oil boycott . Back from his journey to the South , President Nixon announced Tuesday he would send Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger to the Middle East soon to get talks started between Syria and Israel on a disengagement of their forces on the Golan Heights . The Secretary will first attend the meeting of Latin American Foreign Ministers in Mexico City this week . The President did not touch on the Arab oil embargo in his brief remarks on the White House lawn after an almost two-hour meeting with the Egyptian and Saudi Arabian foreign ministers . He described the talks as " very constructive " but did not elaborate . Saudi minister hopeful Saudi Arabia Foreign Minister Omar Saqqaf , however , told newsmen , " We are hopeful that something will happen , and soon , for the benefit of the U.S. , of the Middle East , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the two foreign ministers ' short comments came as somewhat of a , letdown . Earlier there had been indications that Egyptian Foreign Minister Ismael Fahmy would convey some " good news " to the President and a more substantive positive announcement had been anticipated . Washington now is being careful not to link its diplomatic efforts to achieve a disengagement agreement on the Syrian front with the issue of the Arab oil embargo . // *Mideast progress indicated ; Syria holds key to oil // But Arab leaders have declared that the embargo will not be eased until there is an agreement acceptable to Damascus on the withdrawal of Israeli forces . The meeting with President Nixon seemed to indicate again : no Israeli-Syrian disengagement , no lifting of the oil boycott . The closest Mr. Nixon came to referring to the oil embargo was a reference to the importance of achieving a permanent Mideast settlement and improving relations with all countries , " economically , diplomatically , and in other ways . " It had been speculated that the " good news " which the Egyptian Foreign Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was willing to yield on the issue of prisoners of war . Israel has been adamant that it would not talk with the Syrians until it received a list of Israeli POWs and Red Cross representatives visited the men . Two areas involved Two different geographic areas are involved in the dispute over the Golan Heights , a plateau from which Syrian artillery used to pound Israeli settlements in northern Galilee . One is the more than 400 square miles captured by Israel in the June , 1967 , war and another the approximately 300 square miles taken last October . Israel has hinted that it would consider trading the latter region , from which the Syrian civilians were driven out ; but apparently the first piece of Golan Heights territory will be harder to deal with . In a recent speech , Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir said her government regards the Golan Heights as an " integral part " of Israel . Further , there have been reports from Jerusalem that Israel plans to build a Jewish town of 5,000 people on the strategic bights . But administration officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israeli position , noting that she is under strong pressure at home to put a Cabinet together and therefore has made statements designed to win political support . The domestic political situation in Syria also has been a complicating factor In Dr. Kissinger 's efforts to bring Damascus into the Geneva peace talks . President Assad had adopted a tougher stance toward Israel and boycotted the Geneva conference , apparently because the ruling Baath Party is divided on the issue of negotiating with Israel . Since Dr. Kissinger 's last visit to Damascus , President Sadat of Egypt has been exerting his influence to get Syria to compromise on the POW issue , and the Soviet Union reportedly also has played a role in urging the Syrians to participate in the overall negotiations at Geneva . Israel lists 120 Israelis as having been captured by Syria during the October war . It holds about 300 Syrian prisoners , a list of which has been provided the Red Cross . Syria has demanded an Israeli withdrawal from the October cease-fire lines before handing over a POW list and starting disengagement talks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
