txt The tuna and the dolphin ? two creatures that often dance across the seas in tandem ? swim into turbulent waters in 1977 . Congress adjourned in October with a stalemate over how to amend a 1972 law designed to save dolphins , from tuna fishermen 's nets . Now that law may actually work to the dolphin 's peril next year . The Pacific fleet of 135 U.S. tuna clippers may not leave port in January at the start of the tuna season . A federal court in June , citing the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Aet banned tuna fishing in 1977 unless government quotas on dolphin killing were set . Those quotas will not be ready until early // Dolphin dances in waters off Bermuda Who will toss him a preserver ? From page 1 *U.S. law to protect dolphins may actually kill more spring ? thus opening the way for foreign tuna fleets to net the U.S. share of America 's favorite seafood . And non-U.S . tuna fishermen kill two and a half times more dolphin in their large nets than U.S. fishermen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dolphin , or porpoise , to congregate over tuna , a signal to fishermen of a catch . Without meaning to , tuna fishermen snare the dolphin , which then panic and drown . Two species of dolphin , Spinner and White-belly , may have stocks that can barely sustain their numbers , government scientists announced in September . Dolphin stocks associated with tuna today are only 50 to 60 percent of what they were in 1959 , when the tuna industry converted from li.t-and-catch fishing to using nets . As foreign vessels switch , too , their share of the dolphin kill increases to about one-half of the U.S fleet 's today . At an Oct. 11 meeting of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission ? an international body which sets quotas for yellowfin tuna catches each year in a prime five million square-mile Pacific Ocean region ? U.S. officials plan to press for restrictions on dolphin killing by foreign vessels . At stake is a $1 billion U.S. tuna industry , which eyes increasing competition from Central and South American fleets on the high seas , resents its own government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set off its competitors ' coasts . But the U.S. fleet supplies only 53 percent of raw tuna needs of Americans . Tuna imports are subject supposedly to the same dolphin-killing restrictions . Foreign sellers , however , need only to " certify " in writing that U.S. rules are followed . No inspections are made . In 1975 , U.S. fishermen accidentally killed an estimated 139,000 dolphin . This year , 55 government observers were aboard U.S. tuna ships and estimated only about 70,000 drownings ( plus or minus an error of 25,000 ) . Hearings to aid the National Marine Fisheries Service ( NMFS ) in setting its first quota begin in November . That process will last into early spring . But already Dr. Robert White , director of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration , responsible for NMFS , pre : diets the U.S. quota will be 30,000 ? if U.S. ships ever leave dockside . No fishing permits will be issued until the quota is set : From January to March , the court ban will stick unless a stay is granted . And even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new equipment to help release dolphins from their nets , little hope is given that 1977 will be a bumper crop year and a boom for the price of a tuna fish sandwich . Reduction of dolphin killings , says Dr. White , " to a satisfactory level is unlikely to be achieved by a single idea or technological development " ? such as sonar beepers to lure dolphins away , net backdowns , or speedboats to rescue dolphins .
