Will the world never tire of Star Wars ? <P> Mready the highest-grossing picture in U.S. history ( $195 million ) , the film may very well break European records too . In Paris , where it opened last October , 1 million people went to see the robots , Artoo Detoo and Threepio , at the annual toy show , and kids say goodbye with a wave of the arm and a " Que la force soit avec toi . " Their parents are standing in line too , and journals have hailed its brave statement of the human spirit . <P> The film opens in London only this week , but the force is already there . Discothques have been playing the music for months , and London papers do n't look complete these days without a Star Wars cartoon , joke or picture . One daily , the Evening News , is even running a picture-studded serialization to boost circulation . The two giant theaters where the movie will play have already racked up $320,000 in advance ticket sales-more than three times the previous record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get knightedm than buy Star Wars tickets . " " I 've been in this business for 45 years , and I 've never seen anything like it , " says John Fairbairn , the film 's publicity director . " It 's an eruption . " <P> Even that unflappable knight of the Jedi , Obi-Wan Kenobi-otherwise known as Sir Alec Guinness-is amazed and a little perplexed by the Star Wars phenomenon . People who have seen the film in the U.S. are making him a cult figure , he says , and reminding him of his duties as the last of a great line of warriors : " It 's a fun movie , but some spooky stuff has crept in . People are taking it too seriously , and I would n't encourage that altogether . " Adds the Catholic convert : " I 'm an alleged Christian , so to that extent , yes , I do believe that something like the force exists . But not as expressed in Star Wars . " <P> Actually , Guinness almost turned the picture down when he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few pages , however , and found himself still turning , a sure sign of a good script . Guinness usually takes more complex roles , like the traitorous diplomat he is playing in Alan Bennett 's current London hit , The Old Country . As Hilary , the high official of the Foreign Office who defects to Russia , Guinness plays a man who loves ironies and verbal puzzles . His own character is hidden , even to himself ; " Hilary is Hilary watching Hilary watching Hilary , " says his wife . Guinness delights in the role 's subtleties , however , and his performance is brilliant throughout . <P> The part of Obi-Wan had no such psychological depth , he notes , but he enjoyed it nonetheless . " It had a touch of Tolkien 's Lord of the Rings , " he says . " It was a rather simple outline of a good man who had some magical powers . I tried to make him uncomplicated . I 'm cunning enough now to know that to be simple carries a lot of weight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he still regrets . When the planet Alderaan blows up , Obi-Wan reels backward and clutches his forehead , an unpardonable clich in Guinness 's opinion . " I still go hot and cold when I think of that scene , " he confesses . During those awkward moments , he has at least one consolation : his 2% of the film 's profits .
