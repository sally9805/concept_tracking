Did Richard Nixon " usurp " the constitutional powers of Congress when he unilaterally ordered troops into Cambodia ? Swarms of lawyers went to Washington last week to join an increasingly intense debate on the issue ( see THE NATION ) . Their most persuasive arguments raised fundamental questions that go far beyond Cambodia and the Indochina war . <P> Many of the antiwar lawyers conceded that proving the Cambodian " attacks " unconstitutional may be difficult . Nixon 's authority as Commander in Chief gives him full power to protect U.S. troops in the field . But could he exercise that authority if the troops fighting in Southeast Asia were not deployed legally in the first place ? The 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution gave congressional support to President Johnson 's use of " all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the United States . " The dissenters argue , of course , that Congressmen who voted for the resolution after a reported enemy attack on two U.S. destroyers never intended it to be a de facto declaration of war . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the critics add , it is unfair to conclude that Congress thus approves of the war . <P> These arguments may never be settled . More important , many dissidents argue that usurpation of congressional power has been going on not just for months but for decades . As a thoughtful memorandum being circulated in Washington by Yale Law School students puts the issue : " The expansion of the war into Cambodia is the latest in a long series of acts which , taken together , have nearly stripped Congress of its war power . Undoubtedly , the speed with which crises develop in the modern world necessitates a strong executive who can respond quickly . The real question is whether the balance has shifted too far in favor of the executive . " <P> Authority to Declare . When the constitutional drafters met in Philadelphia in 1787 , they deliberately denied U.S. Presidents the kind of unfettered war power that European kings enjoyed . Instead , they gave Congress authority to " declare " war , " raise and support armies , " make military appropriations for a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union , suppress insurrections , and repel invasions . " The only exceptions to legislative war authority were intended to be narrow : the framers made the President " Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States . " They also refrained from giving Congress the power to " make " war-a more comprehensive authority than the power to declare it . <P> According to James Madison , the President would thus have " power to repel sudden attacks . " To many scholars the implication is clear . The President was to initiate emergency defensive operations ; Congress was to remain responsible for all offensive ones . Said Thomas Jefferson : " We have given one effectual check to the dog of war by transferring the power of letting him loose from those who are to spend to those who are to pay .
