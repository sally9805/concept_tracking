But Carter 's ambitious fuel program could have been much tougher <P> The first casualty of Jimmy Carter 's Cabinet shake-ups was the momentum that he had been building behind his staggeringly expensive , exceedingly complex and long overdue new energy program . That is doubly unfortunate , because the damage was self-inflicted , and even more because the plan makes a start on attacking a problem that will continue to menace the U.S. long after the switches in the Cabinet have faded in significance . <P> The President got off to a promising start . In a blizzard of speeches and briefings early last week , he described plans to spend a breathtaking $141 billion over the next decade ( " one of the biggest figures you ever heard ... the unparalleled peacetime commitment " ) . The aim is to cut U.S. oil imports in half , and thus prevent the nation 's economy from remaining in bondage to the price and production whims of OPEC . For about 40 hours , beginning with his TV talk Sunday night , Carter was winning popular and political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tub-thumping speeches to county officials in Kansas City and communication workers in Detroit , he drew the loudest and longest cheers that he has heard in months . <P> But once news of the mass resignations in the President 's official family broke Tuesday afternoon , talk of import quotas , synthetic fuels and energy independence was drowned out by a new buzz of puzzled speculation . Early in the week congressional Democrats were talking about whooping through key parts of the President 's program , including the windfall-profits tax on oil companies that is supposed to provide all the money for Carter 's plans , before the legislators recess on Aug. 3 for four weeks . But by week 's end they were making plain that Carter , and the nation , will have to wait . Said Louisiana 's canny Russell Long , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , which must approve the tax : " I would n't bet on there being $141 billion to support Carter 's whole program . I 'm not going to force anything through the committee . " <P> The loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be challenged and changed in Congress anyway . Only the public sense of crisis brought on by the exasperating gasoline lines gave the President the chance to win bold action on long-range plans . That sense of crisis is ebbing rapidly , and gasoline lines are shortening drastically as a result of Saudi Arabia 's decision to increase crude production . The less the feeling of urgency , the greater the opportunity for quarreling special interest groups to pick the program apart .
