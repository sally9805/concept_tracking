Rather than watch Agnes de Mille 's ballet , Fall River Legend , New York Times Dance Critic Clive Barnes once wrote , " I would prefer to play pinochle , which is all the more surprising since I have never played pinochle in my life . " In the line of duty , however , Barnes attended another performance of the ballet ( about the ax-wielding Lizzie Borden ) and wrote a glowing review of Marcia Hayde , who was guest dancer with the American Ballet Theater . Unpleased was Ballerina Sallie Wilson , the ABT regular who has danced the lead role impeccably for many seasons without getting what she considers to be a fair shake from Barnes . " I 've had a whole career that he 's ignored , " she fumed . " Then he meets me at parties and gives me a big slushy kiss and tells me I 'm his favorite girl . " No more Ms. Nice Guy , decided Wilson , and the next time she saw Barnes , which happened to be the night after his review appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . Barnes ' review of her performance : " I guess somebody does n't like me . " <P> Singing groups come and go like May flies these days , but last week a 20-member ensemble called the Million Dollar Chorus came and went in what must be record time : one hour . The chorus consisted of such New York City boosters as Polly Bergen , Robert Merrill , Ruby Dee , Celeste Holm and Guy Lombardo . They all assembled at a recording studio to perform one number , a snappily chauvinistic tune called Mad About You Manhattan . Sample lyric : " A double-decker bus is fun in Piccadilly Square/ But I prefer a subway car to take me everywhere . " The idea is that the record will make money for the Citizens Committee for New York City , which is concerned with improving services in the debt-ridden city . <P> It may have come as a shock to some passersby to see Actress Sandy Dennis standing outside the Brooks Atkinson Theater in New York with a small cat in her arms , offering to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has a thing about cats , and lives with 33 of them ( guests who drop in for a visit have been known to find fur in their drinks ) . So when the Humane Society of New York City decided to auction off some homeless kittens , guess who was asked to be auctioneer ? Dennis did fairly well , too : she sold seven cats for $70 and , it goes without saying , picked out one to take home . " His name is Kelly , " says Dennis , " and I have three others like him-but not just like him . " <P> The IBM chess tournament in Amsterdam was over , and Russian Grandmaster Victor Korchnoi , 45 , ranked second only to World Champion Anatoli Karpov , had finished in a tie for first place . But Korchnoi had a private end game to complete : he defected and sought asylum . Tass , the Soviet news agency , quickly counterattacked , accusing Korchnoi of being " obsessed with vanity . " In fact , Korchnoi has been in dutch with Soviet chess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost in a semifinal world championship match to Karpov and then complained publicly that his fellow grandmaster had a " poor chess arsenal . " But Korchnoi 's gambit seems to have caught everyone off guard , particularly his wife and 17-year-old son in Leningrad . They knew nothing of the defection until they heard it announced on a Voice of America radio broadcast .
