Freud , Spock and Piaget have charted almost every inch of childhood . Psychoanalyst Erik Erikson put the final touches on a convincing map of adolescence . Yet until very recently , most of the charting stopped near the age of 21 - as if adults escape any sequence of further development . Now a growing number of researchers are surveying the adult life cycle . <P> The research so far has been narrow , concentrating largely on white , middleclass American males . But in " separate studies , three of the most important life-cycle scholars-Psychiatrist Roger Gould of U.C.L.A. , Yale Psychologist Daniel Levinson and Harvard Psychiatrist George Vaillant-have reached some remarkably similar conclusions that add new dimensions to the topography of postadolescent life . The main features : <P> 16-22 : LEAVING THE FAMILY . In this period , youthful fantasies about adulthood slowly give way . Young people begin to find their peers useful allies in an effort to break the hold of the family . Peer groups , in turn , tend to impose group beliefs . Emotions are kept under wraps , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be viewed as betrayal . <P> 23-28 : REACHING OUT . Following Erik Erikson , who found the dominant feature of the 20s to be a search for personal identity and an ability to develop intimacy , Gould , Levinson and Vaillant see this period as an age of reaching toward others . The growing adult is expansive , devoted to mastering the world ; he avoids emotional extremes , rarely bothers to analyze commitments . To Levinson , this is a time for " togetherness " in marriage . It is also a time when a man is likely to acquire a mentor-a patron and supporter some eight to 15 years older . <P> 29-34 : QUESTIONS , QUESTIONS . All the researchers agree that a crisis generally develops around age 30 . Assurance wavers , life begins to look more difficult and painful , and self-reflection churns up new questions : " What is life all about ? Why ca n't I be accepted for what I am , not what others ( boss , society , spouse ) expect me to be ? " An active social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marital satisfaction , and the spouse is often viewed as an obstacle instead of an asset . Marriage becomes particularly vulnerable to infidelity and divorce . Vaillant sees a crassness , callowness and materialism at this stage . Levinson detects a wrenching struggle among incompatible drives : for order and stability , for freedom from all restraints , for upward mobility at work . <P> <P> Says he : " If a man does n't start to settle down by age 34 , his chances of forming a reasonably satisfying life structure are quite small .
