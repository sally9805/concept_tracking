On board his plane bound for Washington , Egyptian President Sadat spoke with TIME Correspondent Wilton Wynn of his hopes for the Camp David talks . Highlights : <P> <P> &gt; " I will be frank with Carter-he is a dear friend . I will tell him my people to a certain extent are disappointed . Some are beginning to ask : ' Are we friends or not ? ' " <P> &gt; " I am always optimistic by nature , but really I am very disheartened , and I am coming because I like the people of the United States . This all started when I received a personal letter from Carter . Now I am coming to America for arbitration . You 've got to help me . " <P> &gt; " Some Arabs want me to say I regret my Jerusalem mission . No , I do n't regret it . Let 's hope that with Carter we can discuss giving momentum again in the spirit of my mission . " <P> &gt; " Let me ask this question : On what grounds is Begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American arsenal in Israel . We had thought it would make them feel more secure and flexible , but they are using it to claim others ' land . " <P> &gt; " I shall never oppose the United States ' sending a plane and a tank to every Israeli man and woman . But let them use them inside their borders to feel secure , not to claim others ' land . I have nothing against the special relationship between the U.S. and Israel . " <P> &gt; " I am asking for the same arms that Israel is getting . I do n't like to be treated like before , with one eye on Israel and one eye on me . I am asking arms not to attack Israel ... because American arms can not be used against the allies or friends of America . But I have other responsibilities now . I have received alarming reports from Africa , from Somalia and Chad . " <P> &gt; " I have chosen my fate , and there is no way to turn back on this . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those moments in Jerusalem . I wo n't let them down . Unfortunately there was no response from the other side . But if time proves that I am wrong , I must pay for this . I shall not try to change my ideas , because when I started , I was convinced it was a sacred mission . "
