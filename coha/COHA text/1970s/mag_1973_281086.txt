THE CORPORATION , to be seen Thursday , Dec. 6 , on CBS Reports ( 10-11 p.m . E.S.T. ) , powerfully demonstrates that that archetypal figure of the ' 50s , the Organization Man , is still very much alive-and thinks he is well . <P> He seems to flourish best in small , company-dominated towns like Bartlesville , Okla. , headquarters of Phillips Petroleum Co. , the nation 's 36th largest corporation . Producer-Writer-Reporter Jay McMullen uses Phillips employees to demonstrate in vivid human terms the truth of the generalization that a large number of Americans are eager to trade most of their autonomy as individuals in return for the security and group identification that the organization offers . <P> What sets McMullen 's documentary apart , turns it into a cautionary tale the impact of which is close to tragic , is its central figure , William W. Keeler , 65 , who retired earlier this year as Phillips ' chairman and chief executive officer . Like every Phillips leader before him , he had devoted his entire life to the company and to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pleasures of family and leisure along the way . McMullen picks him up a few months before retirement , as he undertakes his last major task for Phillips : making smooth the transfer of power to his hand-picked successor , William Martin , 56 . <P> Tough , quiet-spoken and by no means an unattractive figure , Keeler nevertheless gives the impression of a spirit deliberately blunted , an intellect deliberately narrowed in order to achieve his goal . He makes it across the finish line-a retirement banquet at which he receives diamond-and-emerald cuff links patterned after the Phillips trademark-only to pay , at last , the price for his unquestioning belief that what was good for the corporation was good for him and , indeed , for everybody else . Keeler is now under investigation for authorizing an illegal corporate donation to the Committee for the Re-Election of the President . <P> The corporation 's official position is that Keeler authorized the donation " without the approval or knowledge of the board of directors . " As McMullen says : " Yet to be explained is how one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and acquiescence of other senior officers . " McMullen 's account of Keeler 's triumph and downfall-both based on the fallacy of loyalty to an institutional structure rather than to himself and to generally accepted standards of moral accountability-adds up to one of television 's fine hours . <P> Richard Schicke <P> CATHOLICS is a play that , according to the ads , you do not have to be Catholic to love . Maybe not , but Catholics of all stripes must have found something particularly provocative in this rich , fine and haunting " fable , " which last week got CBS 'S revived Playhouse 90 series off to a splendid start . <P> The action is set in the near future . The Fourth Vatican Council has come and gone , the Latin Mass and private confession are outlawed , and the church 's ecumenical embrace is even touching Buddhists . Theological liberalism and social activism , canonized by Rome 's authority , have become the new orthodoxy . Rome is still Rome , however , ready to enforce the new dogmas with some of the same thumbscrew pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
