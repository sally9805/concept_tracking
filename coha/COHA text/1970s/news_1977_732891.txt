txt Governor Carey 's annual message to the Legislature was clearly intended to be heard as well outside the Capitol as within . He announced that New York State has emerged from the intensive care unit and can be fairly described as convalescent from what might have been a terminal disease two years ago . Since survival no longer seems in question , the Governor devoted himself to describing how the still emaciated state economy can be made to walk and nut on weight . In 1977 , this means a regimen of less government and more self-help . Accordingly , the ' Governor has recommended what he describes as a $200 million program in tax Cuts on an annual basis . That $200 million sounds more impressive than the promised individual savings , which , on the average , would buy little more than a few pounds of coffee for each taxpayer . The Governor wants to signal a change from the past practice of assisting the private economy by the creation of new state agencies or new buildings to put them in . For the legislators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be welcome news . Probably it is even more welcome than his words in praise of their statesmanship in the enactment of difficult legislation over the past two years . Statesmanship is an expensive encomium for any elected official . It generally suggests that the incumbent has voted for something in the general interest that his local constituency viewed with misgivings or horror . Having helped to bring the state back from the brink , the legislators may now feel that fewer painful votes lie ahead . If we hear the Governor 's words correctly , he is saying nothing of the sort . ? There will be many occasions during the next few months on which the $200 million in lost tax revenues will seem extremely attractive as a healing unguent for the economic woes of cities , towns and organized constituencies . There will be difficult decisions on issues ranging from court reform to rent control , from budgeting to government reorganization . The Governor may hope , and we hope with him , that the pleasure of enacting a tax cut may to some extent overcome the pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tax cut in the months ahead will be the quality of leadership sin both parties in both houses of the Legislature . In this diverse state , with its striking mix of metropolitan , suburban and rural interests , its weakened patronage base to support party loyalties , and its shortage of money with which to plaster over local disappointments , heavy burdens fall on the party leadership . " tVithout firm direction the Legislature would become a raucous auction room of competing bidders . Last year 's Senate leadership by both Senators Anderson and Ohrenstein met the test . The loss of Albert Blumenthal as majority leader of the Assembly poses a serious problem for all New Yorkers . The most important characteristic of a successful Assembly majority leader is his influence over his fellows , preferably an influence gained by a comprehensive understanding of the issues , skill in debate and the ambition for strong legislative record in 1977 . We believe that Assemblyman Stanley Fink possesses these qualities , and welcome him . The magnitude of this year 's task will become apparent when the Governor proceeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation next week .
