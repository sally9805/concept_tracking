txt Dr. Daniel Ellsberg has added new details here to the saga of the Pentagon study on Vietnam , which he has admitted he leaked to the United States press . He said that : 0 Former Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara , when testifying about the details of the Tonkin Gulf incident in 1964 , and later , gave a misleading impression of what transpired . There was confusion , Dr. Ellsberg said . at the highest levels of government about what exactly happened ? particularly whether there had been a " second attack " by the enemy . He said that Mr. McNamara , while himself not fully convinced that there had been such a second attack , gave the impression that there had , indeed , been one , 0 He was gratified that Attorney General John N. Mitchell had dramatized the disclosure and the substance of the papers by moving to enjoin their publication . He said it would have been most difficult , if not impossible , to have the fullness of the study reported , together with big newspaper play , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earlier Eisenhower-Truman years , had the Justice Department not thrown its intense spotlight on publication . 0 One of the reasons Sen. J. W. Fulbright ( D ) of Arkansas had not disclosed information from the Pentagon report ( which Dr. Ellsberg says he gave to the Senator in 1969 ) was that he believed that the Senator was protecting him , knowing the severe penalties that were involved . Dr. Ellsberg charged there is an " enormous irresponsibility of our highest officials in dealing with national secrets " and that he hoped the publication of the Pentagon papers would serve as a " lessson " for government officials , that they can not operate under conditions by which the background of their actions would be forever concealed from the American public . Government officials working under prevalent conditions of secrecy become " careless " because they are not answerable for their actions , he said ; the commander in chief should not be allowed to think that he has access to the nation 's Polaris submarines and other military equipment to " use as he sees fit without an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Tonkin Gulf charge // ? He takes responsibility for getting the Pentagon papers to most of the newspapers that published them , and he said that the material did not go from one newspaper to another . " At first I thought I was the source for all of the newspapers . But on further reflection there was at least one other source for one other newspaper , " he said . " How did you go about choosing the newspapers you leaked the information to ? " " I thought of papers I had read in the past , those that were informative and straightforward in reporting the war . " I had no intention to begin with to give out these papers to any other newspaper except the New York Times . I was responsive to the strategy of the Justice Department which I had not foreseen . " Some selection of newspapers had to be made . I did this rather arbitrarily . " Did you choose " dove " papers . " No . I used personal preferences The Christian Science Monitor is not a dove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers . My father reads the Monitor , and the Detroit Free Press . It 's a small thing  --  but it was that sort of thing . " There has been at least one charge from an informed source that the New York Times used material not in the Pentagon report and not all of the important Pentagon material was used . " Approximately four volumes were not given to any paper , including the diplomatic material , and negotiations . " It is possible that the Times has material not from the Pentagon papers . No other paper other than the Times has material other than the Pentagon papers . " Why did you disappear from sight after the first publication in the Times ? " I made myself unavailable purposely so as not to distract from what I thought would be the main legal point ? the newspapers ' right not to disclose the r sources . I was always in a position to make that point moot . " Did you know the penalties for what you were doing ? " Until recently I took it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't do this without great jeopardy . " I did n't know the legal sanctions in detail until quite recently , until my lawyers told me . Now I feel it is not entirely clear that I have violated a law . Most laws involve intent to harm the United States ? and this was the opposite of my intent . "
