IT 'S HARD TO REALIZE that the war began forty years ago . I mean the war that matters , the one that divided Europe down the middle , shrank Germany , transformed China , begot the Third World , conferred Southeast Asia on the Americans for a generation , and reduced Britain to the status of the Netherlands . The one that killed 55 million people and spawned the acronym habit ( CINCPAC , ETOUSA , AMGOT ) , and , as Belsen and Maidenek were uncovered , jolted the progressive modern world into an understanding , dormant since the Renaissance , of the reality of evil . The one that extinguished European Jewry but redeemed the New York intellectual tone and made America a culturally serious place for the first time in its existence . The one that created 13 million veterans and then established the contemporary middle-class conception of the desirable by sending them to universities , installing them in professions , and lending them money to start businesses and buy the proclaimed ideal one-family suburban American house . The war matters , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a warhead and penicillin and the atomic pile and the proximity fuse and the Pentagon and the paperback . Those who had direct adult access to the war and who experienced firsthand its forms and textures are now in their fifties . Others curious about it must depend upon volumes of history and memoir , and upon paintings and drawings and photographs . Paintings like those in James Jones 's WWII are of little use : their news is less about the war than about the state of representational painting and illustration and hack portraiture during the early Forties . We could use a Cuernica about Oradour-sur-Glane or Manila or Aachen . In its absence we can read , or reread , some photographs from the war , photographs so familiar they risk growing dull . Now is a good time to interpret them , before they begin to look as if Matthew Brady took them . OR HISTORICAL INSTINCT about World War II , our " myth . " if you will , is that it constituted a notably moral common cause , one moment in our history when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly subdued themselves in the interests of virtue . Because the concentration camps and the Japanese treatment of prisoners were so much more loathsome than anything the Americans did ? with the possible exception of dropping the second atomic bomb ? the war , as the journalist Paul Addison has said , " served a generation of ... Americans as a myth which enshrined their essential purity , a parable of good and evil . " And it would be a mistake to imagine that myth betokens some sort of fraud or self-deception . Myths assume solidity and staying power only when they are essentially true . If we locked away and humiliated the Nisei , we gassed no Jews , Gypsies , or homosexuals , and we hanged no partisans . If we bombed Dresden . it was someone else who exterminated the Polish officer corps in the Katyn Forest . We did not starve our prisoners to death in Siberia or Manchuria nor hack off the heads of enemy airmen brought down . For purposes of American self-definition , it was , in the words of the journalist Geoffrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against palpable evil , " a war that confirmed the purposes of the Republic . The solidity of this myth can be measured by the energy and originality Joseph Heller and Thomas Pynchon have had to deploy to chip away at it . For the myth-making memory , the principle of anonymity is one way of sanctifying the war . The myth requires that " servicemen " be depicted , at least in photographs , as virtually anonymous . Because the war was a common cause , no one in it has a right to appear as anything but anonymous . Thus we feel that American photographs of the war are more significant and " authentic " the less they render identifiable individual human faces . " Stars " are not wanted . A case in point is the familiarity of the one classic photograph of the war , Joe Rosenthal 's flag-raising marines at Iwo Jima . Six men are at work , but the face of only one is visible , dimly and in profile ? and in reproductions his face is customarily blacked into unidentifiable silhouette . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suggesting , in a way bourgeois faces can never do , powerful and simple communal purpose . Change the flag to red and you have " Soviet art . " Strip the men and you have Italian Fascist sculpture . The visible right legs of the six are all " in step , - bent the same way and those parts of faces not obscured by hel mets are concealed by the arms reaching up in common . The image is that of a committee , soiled and exhausted , but nevertheless acting " as one man " in a rare , and thus precious , moment of unanimity . The picture seems " right because it is so successful an emblem of the common will triumphant . It seems right because it raises finally the myth of the New Deal to its apotheosis . It brings an era to an end . After this picture , there 's no place to go but " postwar . ' The opposite convention , which asserts the identity and uniqueness of individuals , belongs more to the journalistic prose of the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ernie Pyle work by getting in as many hometown names as possible . Thus Tregaskis in Guadalcanal Diary ( 1943 ) : " Our guide was a sturdy young man in high boots , a Capt . Stallings ( Capt . George R. Stallings of Augusta , Ga ) . " In Brave Men ( 1944 ) Pyle grows even more circumstantial : " When I went up the trail my guide was Pfc . Fred Ford , of 3037 North Park Drive , East St. Louis . " In language even the dead can be designated . Pyle 's much-loved Captain Waskow , whose body is brought down an Italian mountain by ? uleback and revered in the moonlight by his men ( " I sure am sorry , sir " ) , is identified as Capt . Henry T. Waskow , of Belton , Texas . One reason the reportorial prose of the war seems so dated is just this constant locating of everyone within a presumably static American scene with significantly different " areas . " The postwar mobility and national uniformity make the habit quaint , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mana , while prose does not . The dead in the photographs must not be identifiable . Henry Waskow 's next of kin are pleased to see his name in print , but they must not see his body , nor ever his face . The first published picture of American war dead , which appeared in January , 1943 , thirteen months after the United States declared war , ostentatiously shows them facedown on Buna Beach , mercifully half-covered with drifts of wet sand . Photographers of the Malmedy massacre painted snow over the faces to prevent recognition , and in a well-known set of Robert Capa photographs showing one of the last Americans to be killed in Europe dying on a Leipzig balcony , the face is commonly blacked out by " the censor . " Faces of combat infantry in action are rare , too , in photographs . because the photographer is seldom in front of the attacking troops : what we see are expressive but anonymous backs , packs with entrenching tools , helmets from the rear . The photograph of the troops landing on Omaha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of a rifle , who could blame you for being the last man off the boat and sheltering within it as long as possible ? NONYMITY Is such a powerful convention in World War II American photography that the picture of the Russian boy partisan about to be hanged near Minsk in October , 1941 , strikes one as completely " European , " and thus as a useful contrast . Regardless of the common cause , this boy is flaunting his identity , the very extremity of his situation focusing his selfhood . The normality , even the respectability , of the Germans in the picture is worth noticing . They are fVehrmacht , regular German army , not SS , and the one at the lower right , with the glasses , is positively elderly and doubtless quite nice . As a further photograph indicates , when they have finished this job they will hang on the girl a neatly printed sign reading , WE ARE PARTISANS AND HAVE SHOT AT GERMAN SOLDIERS . The sign will be in both German and Russian , and thus , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will cheer up frightened German troops marching past , persuading them that " something is being done . " The girl has been hanging a few minutes . She is only a foot lower than the boy , indicating that she had been standing on a low chair or box , since kicked away . She has slowly strangled in the wartime German way , and the boy does not want to look at her . Is he really smiling ? If it is a real smile and not a fleeting grimace , is the cause self-consciousness , bitterness , or despair ? Or ? a remote possibility ? ironic triumph ? His wearing his light-colored cap to the last is a beau geste . The two-colored decorative rope , suggestive of a bathrobe cord or a gift-tie , is an almost frivolous touch in harmony with the boy 's ambiguous expression . In contrast , anonymity and a vision of the common cause in jeopardy dominate the photograph of the Naval Air Station on Ford Island in Pearl Harbor , taken just after eight o'clock in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made several bombing and strafing passes while most of the sailors were sleeping , showering , breakfasting , or going about their business in their solid and comfortable permanent barracks . A few of the people who have poured . onto the field are running , but most are so shocked they are just looking , taking in the unbelievable , the mangled inert floatplanes and Catalinas on the ground and the spectacular hot fireball rising in the background , where the battleship Arizona has just exploded . Fifteen hundred men are dying over there , but these watchers do n't know that yet . The shirtless man on the ground looks less wounded than simply appalled . His legs have given way and he has had to sit down . Why is the standing man who has been talking to him half-dressed in white , his wallet ( he 's left-handed ) in his back pocket ? He has been planning to go into Honolulu on a day-pass and has been getting dressed for town . The man a bit farther away , walking , not running , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towel or a skivvy shirt around his neck . Decency and normality at all costs . He 's so shocked he 's decided not to pay attention to the fireball . The emotions here are less terror or horror than disbelief , a dogged , near-psychotic determination to insist that what 's happening is not taking place . That 's what the wind sock on the hangar at the left seems to be doing , too . The picture can be taken at all only because the war is so new : no one knows , as everyone will in a few months , that he should be down in a slit trench , not standing around . Because , as Susan Sontag has said , " photography inexorably beautifies , " there is complicated irony in the relation of personal disaster to sharp technique in the photograph of the sailor hanging over his gun mount . An ugly picture , to be sure , in the Weegee auto crash or suicide-jump tradition of tough American spot-news frontal-flash photography of the late Thirties . And yet beautifully composed ? a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if the underside of a kamikaze plane has smashed across the gun mount on its way to the superstructure , carrying away most of the sailor 's 40-mm anti-aircraft gun and his helmet . In some versions of this print the dark , ragged top of the ammunition box blown off the gun mount has been airbrushed white to simplify the lower half of the picture . The sailor 's spine and left arm are broken , and the shock has undone his left cuff button . In photographs dead sailors are always more ironic than dead soldiers if their feet show , because they wear quaMAN 'S FACE can sometimes be shown A sl and the picture still project anonymity , as in the one of the small overcoated soldier eating his first hot meal after fifteen days of fighting in the Hiirtgen Forest . The artistic tradition here is that of Thirties documentary , the tradition of Walker Evans 's American Photographs ( 1938 ) or Evans and James Agee 's Let Us Novs Praise Famous Men ( 1941 ) . To cite Sontag again , documentary aspires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sharecroppers , and residents of the Tennessee Valley , " the poor and the dispossessed , the nation 's forgotten citizens . " Or , in the terms James Jones invokes to interpret Sad Sack , " the army 's and the war 's ' pore dumb fuck ' of an eternal victim . " The soldier in this photograph is preeminently one of the nation 's forgotten citizens , and although the camera singles him out , he is depicted as the prototypal invisible man , representative of the millions of forgotten citizens ? who remembers even Generals Hodges and Patch and Devers ? ? consigned to France during the winter of 1944-45 . The paradigm of this soldier 's manner as he eats is the victim-tramp Chaplin asserting his unshakable dignity by dainty gestures involving toothpicks , napkins , saltcellars . This soldier 's management of his bread and fork registers a determination to recover his humanity after two weeks ' brutalization . Every gesture , even the dancerly position of the feet , says , " I am not an animal . I am not . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifting a food particle from a tooth . His hands are shockingly filthy . He 's wielding the white bread both to insulate the food from his dirty fingers and to help him pretend he 's sitting in a restaurant or at his own dinner table and that the canteen cup is made of porcelain . It is very cold , but he has taken off his gloves while eating to promote this illusion . Past the need for such rationalizations is the rifleman killed by German mortar-shell fragments when he has almost got safely across a pontoon footbridge on the Roer in 1945 . The shell has hit the east bank a few feet away . Hence the bits of dirt on the body . The two men running up are engineers " in charge of " the bridge . They are going to remove the body so that other infantrymen waiting on the far bank to cross will not be demoralized by it . The dead soldier wears a field jacket and a bandolier of rifle ammunition , and his raincoat is properly folded in his cartridge belt behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his articles are arranged the way they 're supposed to be . The fingers of his right hand are " extended and joined " as they are when he 's at attention or saluting . A good soldier , this man has followed all instructions , and when he has been ordered to run across the bridge , he has run across . He has been wearing a life preserver in case he falls into the river . His rifle will he salvaged , repaired , and reissued . As these photographs suggest , you can do things with black and white that you ca n't do with color , just as you can do things with radio and print that you ca n't do with television . In photographs blood is black , but truce flags and nurses ' caps and hospital sheets are white . White is safety and peace and innocence and clean oblivion , the tone of the imagination 's final silent snow , secret snow . Hence in these photographs the terrible irony of the partisan 's cap , the Ford Island sailor 's innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mount , the white bread in the little soldier 's hand , the white hand of the good soldier on the Roer pontoon bridge . And there 's some eloquent white in the Omaha Beach picture , too . The last man off the boat appears to be wearing on his left shoulder a crude bandage , hastily applied , and the remains of bandages and dressings lie at the right front of the boat , where someone has also abandoned a heavy roll of sound-power telephone wire he 's supposed to carry ashore . Most likely it belonged to the wounded man , who now feels satisfactorily out of it and licensed to drop everything , honoring the convention that , once wounded , one turns instantly into a noncombatant and sheds helmet , arms , grenades , and ammunition as fast as possible . One has done one 's bit , and there 's no need to do it twice . R EADING PHOTOGRAPHS of the war is a way of experiencing its very different looks in different places . Topography and flora create profoundly different contexts , giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the South Pacific , the setting usually includes palm trees , coconut logs , and sand , lending the proceedings something of the look of a sexy beach-party travesty , especially when sleeves are rolled up or shirts off . The Pacific war takes place in settings romanticized for a generation by South Seas films ( and before that by Robert Louis Stevenson and Rupert Brooke ) , and to be shot at in a venue associated with the assumed ecstasies of Jon Hall and Dorothy Lamoor is much more disillusioning than to be shot at in , say , mountainous country appropriate for hunting . That kind of country , if you add mules and mud and occasional barren fruit and olive trees , is the theater of the Italian campaign , and of North Africa and Sicily before it . The look of those soldiers is entirely different from the look of the South Pacific soldiers and marines . In Italy , no loose fatigues but olive drab woolens , and plain helmets instead of helmet covers , the marine fixture affected in the South Pacific . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two straps and buckles . But the real sign of the Italian campaign soldier is the " armored unit " field jacket , with knitted neck , cuffs , and waist , an unwitting allusion to the treasured high-school athletic jacket . If the troops in Italy resemble a lot of bulky , dispirited , dirty , and scared high-school athletes , those in France and Germany , as the war proceeds , resemble padded automatons programmed less to prosecute hostilities than to defend themselves against freezing . Long , curiously formal overcoats together with gloves and wool scarves and knitted wool caps are the stigmata : even the helmets , with their shrimp nets , look padded and overdressed . At first , combat boots . Then , for the winter of 1944-45 , clumsy black shoe-pats , of the type made by L. L Bean . Fir trees . Fog and snow . Barely holding on when the war was supposed to be over by Christmas . Instead of malaria , trench foot . Like a hypertrophied organic thing , the war altered its appearance as it aged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leggings , flat World War I helmets , long bayonets , Springfield rifles , gas masks worn in the oddly chic triangular carrier under the arm : they looked pert and devoted and successful . Every soldier a Prewitt . Officers wear ostentatious insignia on shoulders . Bataan and Kasserine Pass ended that look ; thereafter wariness and lack of sleep begin to dominate every gesture . The student of World War II photographs can spot that change from behind , in the hunch of shoulders ( make yourself small ) , the helmet worn well down , the bend in the knees , scarves and mufflers hiding gold and silver collar insignia . Things get progressively thicker and less delicately defined . Faces vanish within helmets as eyes learn to look down , alert for the three little prongs of antipersonnel mines sprouting from the earth . The elegant , slender Springfield rifle thickens to the M-1 , waists bulk out with more and more equipment . " Heavy duty " is the industrial idea that begins to dominate as the war itself , rather than its presumed purposes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materiel . Some things , however , never changed . Always the insufficiently armored tanks protected with rows of ad hoc sandbags stacked against the armor : this from the greatest steel-producing country in the world . The second-rate antitank mines , unstable in cold weather , which went off when you moved them or when truckloads of them encountered bumps . The showy gray-white cloud of smoke from American smokeless powder , which always gave your position away . The technologically pretentious little Handy-Talkie radios , optimistic but hopeless . The archaic Browning automatic rifle from World War I. heavy and inept and slow , with its insufficient magazine . All the result of failures of imagination or never-to-be-punished corruptions in procurement . The world 's greatest industrial power left it to the Germans to devise the 88-mm gun , the most effective single weapon of the war , while as usual it disguised its defects of mind and invention with advertising : " The American soldier is the best-equipped in history . " Actually , pathetic makeshift was the rule , from the hedgerow scoops welded onto tanks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seamstresses in Nancy during the winter of 1945 . Maybe the Air Corps was better served , with radar and " window . " It was the " pore dumb fucks " of the ground forces who were expected to shift for themselves while contemplating the operations of the American class system . As Jones says , " You might find a Princeton or Harvard graduate leading a forward infantry platoon , but it was rare . And you almost never found a Princeton or Harvard grad serving as a private in such a platoon . " It 's the black and white of the photographs that brings it all back ? better , it would sometimes seem , than the language of fiction or reporting . Perhaps this is because " news " photographs are the perfect medium for registering events of the twentieth century , events that have so often proved calamitous . Susan Sontag is not writing about war photographs , but what she says is sadly true of them : " Photographs state the innocence , the vulnerability of lives heading toward their own destruction , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . " The survivors of World War II are now pressing sixty . I hope the anonymous man with the shoulder bandage at Omaha is alive and well and that the man sitting on the ground at Ford Island has recovered his composure and that the little soldier eating off the back of the trailer in the cold has found a nice warm restaurant that he likes .
