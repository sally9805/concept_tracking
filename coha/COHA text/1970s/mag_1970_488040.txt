Mr. Eisendrath was a U.S. Foreign Service officer for seven years and has since taught at Harvard and M.I.T. His The Unifying Moment : The Psychological Philosophy of William James and Alfred North Whitehead is to be published in February by Harvard University Press . Despite its loss of absolute power in the recent parliamentary elections ( it took 46 per cent of the total Vote ) , Olof Palme 's Social Democratic Party still rules in Sweden . In office for almost four decades , it has made Sweden one of the most " progressive " countries in the world . Not only has Sweden the highest per capita income in Europe but it also provides a range of services and protections , covering pregnancy , birth , housing , education , unemployment , health , old age and death , which makes it the model of a welfare state . The ruling Social Democrats have already enacted legislation that liberals in the United States could only hope to see passed in the next twenty years . In such a country , political radicals are apt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In an attempt to answer this question , I talked to a number of Swedes , mostly young , on the left wing of the political spectrum . ' But first , at ' Helsingor on the Danish coast , I met a yit  --  ilitg Swedish doctor named Bergman who invited me to stay with him and his family at his home in Lund . Like so many Swedes , he was articulate and confident of his values and judgment . As we talked , he seemed to me an unconscious spokesman for the existing institutions and values of his society . The Bergmans ' home was sparkling ; it was light and airy and equipped with a variety of , labor-saving devices . The kitchen might have been part of the American exhibit at Moscow . The house was what Le Corbusier called a " machine for living . " The style was Swedish modern , broken up with a potpourri of art , as well as numerous objects of handsome Scandinavian craft . On the bookshelves was a sprinkling of world literature . ( The Berg-mans , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared the housework with his wife , who , when she was not enjoying postnatal benefits from the state , worked at her own profession , physical therapy . For them , domestic chores meant neither the drudgery of the maid nor the inspiration of the accomplished cook or homemaker ; they were simply a set of processes which they performed easily and well . The three Bergman children were being raised according to Dr. Spock , whosebook is used all over Sweden . They played well by themselves and , if they seemed somewhat demanding of their parents ' attention , the parents did not seem to mind . When the mother worked , a full-time girl came to the house . The Bergmans explained that centers are being built all over Sweden where , at low cost , working mothers may leave their preschool children . Unfortunately , one was not yet available for them . Like so many Swedes , the Bergmans knew a great deal about the government welfare programs , both the coverage and the costs .. If something seemed reasonable ( Was n't it reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care for a newborn child ? Was n't it reasonable that young people should learn about sex in school ? ) then , of course , it should be done . Or , at least , it should be tried . If it did n't , work , it could be altered or dropped . The attitude seemed essentially pragmatic ; and , in the spirit of pragmatism , lacking any deep ideological underpinnings . To be sure , Sweden still had problems . The Bergmans pointed to the heavy consumption of alcohol ; the suicide rate was high . Some state services were performed in a mechanical or inconsiderate manner . But , the Bergmans believed , any such problems could be solved . For example , at Bergman 's hospital , the doctors had held a series of meetings on how patients could be made to feel more at home . In addition , it had been decided to use the familiar form of address among all hospital employees from sweepers to surgeons , and to have everyone eat together : this would insure closer working relations and ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which came to 40 to 50 per cent of their income . The benefits spoke for themselves . They voted for the Social Democrats with equanimity . Friends of the Bergmans showed the same optimistic attitude toward their world , Conversation among them moved easily , perhaps too easily , from one subject to another . Vietnam was a mistake , of course ; Andy Warhol 's movies were interesting but boring , would n't you say ? A trip to Italy had been quite pleasant , except that the little girl became ill . Were the Swedes cold ? Some , the Berg-mans laughed . Dag Hammarskjiild ? His mysticism was curious , the doctor thought , but quite a few Swedes turned out to be mystics . Of course , the Bergmans assured me , they were not mystics ; they were atheists . At least on the surface , the Bergmans seemed to be well adjusted , really without knots or wrinkles . The doctor was enthusiastic about his work at the hospital ; he enjoyed his moderate hedonism ; he was behind the welfare state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it . With a protagonist such as Bergman , what need did Swedish society have for revolution ? Stockholm 's Book Caf ? sells books and pamphlets all across the Left spectrum : Trotsky on the Russian Revolution , Maoist tracts , Malcolm X , Che Guevara , Cleaver , Fanon , Marcuse , Abbie Hoffman , Jan Myrdal . Except for a few titles by Swedes , the books were foreign products . This balance suggests that Sweden is not a country that encourages theoreticians but rather practical economists and administrators . It means that the Left must for the most part look abroad for its leaders and ideologies . At the Book Caf ? , I was given the address of Caf ? Marx , which serves not only as a meeting place for left- , wing enthusiasts , as does the Book Caf ? , but is also part of a complex of offices for left-wing ' groups . It is the place in Stockholm where such visitors as Stokely Carmichael and Bobby Seale put in appearances and meet the Swedish Left . There I talked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines , printing up posters and newsletters . One , perhaps 20 years old , wore a red Mao button . I asked him what a Maoist did in Stockholm , and received in reply a canned lecture on Maoist theory : one must unify the masses , gain control of the countryside , etc . He knew almost no history , was uninformed about matters Swedish , and was innocent of policy . He was a romantic , what Lenin might have called an " infantile leftist . " I asked him whether , being a Maoist , he would torture an enemy of the working class to gain information , as the French had tortured in Algeria ? Yes , he said with a stiff lip . His friend took up the question . The matter was serious , no longer a game with a tourist . " Would you really , Hans ? " " Maybe , " Hans said , and quickly returned to his task of cranking the mimeograph machine . At Cafe Marx , I also met Ingemar Andersson , a Communist journalist with years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in Sweden . He had just returned from the Swedish Communist Party Congress , where a j ; lid for power by the rightists had created serious divisions . He was exhausted and written out , but still maintained himself brilliantly , showing a rare grasp of history and a flair for economics . " The Social Democrats , " he said , " have taken practically every one of their programs from us , without , of course , giving us credit for them . But now they have run out of gas . If they go further , they must change the real basis of the economic structure , the ownership of the means of production , which is still more than 90 per cent in private hands . They must do this because there will be no other way to generate money for programs and , at the same time , maintain investment , . . . That is why they will have to split , one faction urging retreat or standpattism , the other pushing radically , not for reform , which is now finished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logic of economics . Meanwhile the Communists have not emerged as a major party in Sweden , although in the recent elections they went from a post-Czechoslovakia low of 3 per cent to 4.9 per cent , and again hold the balance of power in the Riksdag . Traditionally they have cooperated with the Social Democrats , and are expected to do so again . Despite their slight increase in popularity , their appeal to the New Left is still fairly limited . One obvious reason is the differences of intellectual style . The Young Philosophers offer still another outlet for leftist activity . Organized by Ake Lofgren , a philosophy professor at the University of Stockholm , it first engaged with other groups in staging anti-Vietnath rallies and raising money for the NLF . Now it confines itself to publishing learned journals on contemporary political and philosophical issues . Lbfgren himself is a quiet man with an inward , ironic smile ; his attitude seems reflected in ' the younger people around him . But the retreat from activism is not peculiar to this group ; there is a general slackening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be that it can not find an issue close enough to home to engage its energies . So far , only while protesting the Vietnamese War have the various groups on the Left been able to make common cause . The young ' people at the Arkiv Santal advise abandoning politics altogether . They are a group which operates exclusively on the local level , helping neighbors to work together for common interests . Their unacknowledged leader  --  they prefer to appear amorphous and leaderless  --  is Thomas Wieslander . He explained : " The less we say about politics , the better . We are interested in uniting people around real , tangible questions , not in dividing them by ideologies . . . . Socialism here in Sweden has been successful in achieving its goal , to create the eco-nomic - base and the security for every man to enjoy his privacy : Now everyone has it  --  his own car , his own flat , his own pension , and so On . But he has no sense of community , no feeling for , his neighbors ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced by the government and the manufacturers that he has everything h ? wants that he never questions it . " How does his group work ? " Our way is not to come in and organize , but , as much as possible , to let the people do it themselves . For instance , if a park is needed in a neighborhood , we will send around little leaflets , which might say , ' Do your children have an adequate place to play ? ' or ' Are , your children tired of watching television in the afternoons ? ' Something like that , and then We find that someone will simply go ahead and call a meeting. , At the meeting , we will have a person to help things along , to say , for example , ' Why does n't everyone write four suggestions for what we might do to provide better play facilities for the children ? ' Then the people will ' talk about the suggestions everyone has written ; and they will set up a committee to carry on the work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private property and the owners object ? " If the people , who actually live in the - area want to make that playground , we try to help them . But we also talk to the police : we explain xplain to them what we are doing , and frequently they let us go ahead . It is not like at Berkeley , with the People 's Park ; there the students and hippies sought trouble with the police . We do everything to avoid that . " How does the group form permanent neighborhood organizations ? " They simply come about of themselves . There are meetings for this and for that , and then it seems foolish always to be calling meetings , so someone suggests getting together , say , every four weeks . The people themselves suggest it . And by then , they know they can get from us what help they need for printing leaflets or other techniques for organizing . But often by then they have learned to work together as a group . " The people at the Arkiv Santa ! are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his girl friend . Weislander said that Santal-started groups are now to be found in more than thirty neighborhoods and Suburbs of Stockholm , that the movement is spreading outside the city . Characteristically for Sweden , Arkiv Santal is beginning to get government support , despite its occasionally illegal methods . According to a director of one of Stockholm 's youth centers , . the welfare state has gone far enough , There are already too many people , he said , who do no real work at all , but cleverly manipulate the system for its benefits , and thus live better than some regular workers . He admitted that a community has not yet been created in Sweden , but what really depressed him was the way in which the government has robbed individuals of their initiative . It has become too easy to think of oneself as a beneficiary of various governmental programs , and too difficult to regard oneself as an individual directing one 's own life . He spoke with pride of Swedes who have sent their benefits back to the government because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition Center Party , the leading party to the right of the Social Democrats . An assistant director of Swedish Radio , Edward Ploman , pointed out that in the arts , government intervention tends to emphasize the- community . Rather than simply providing its artists and craftsmen with stipends , as is often done elsewhere in Europe , it offers them positions in cultural enterprises , such as television , art schools , orchestras , etc . The government does not seek ideological uniformity in its artists , but it does encourage a sense of community responsibility . Ploman also pointed out that the government is not a blind machine , but is continually subject to correction at the local level . All an aggrieved citizen need do is register a complaint with the government inspector , the ombudsman , and any shortcoming will be fully and impartially investigated . Still , between the individual and the government there appears to be no real bridge of community . Part of the problem may be simply overcentralization of governmental control ; for example , the residents take no direct part in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister with whom I spoke felt that the problem is deeper , that the emotional basis for community is lacking . Even within families , he said  --  he is also a marriage counselor  --  men do not talk to their wives about emotional problems , problems of personal interaction . And when occasionally the wives attempt to raise such matters , the men simply turn off . In general , he continued , expressions of character , emotion and personality are avoided as vague and somewhat disquieting ; and discussions of mere behavior often do not get to the heart of the problem . The same reticence about invoking character and emotion affects debates on national legislation . Their appearance in the discussion is enough to damn a proposal as insubstantial , as the introduction of " Socialist " or " Communist " might kill a bill in the United States . Perhaps , the minister said , this attitude could be traced back to the mental habits of an underpopulated and cold country , a country originally of isolated farms . But , whatever the cause , he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve a real community of people working together and caring about one another . To him , the " socialism " of Sweden was really a form of crypto-Marxism . " The idea , " , he said , " is that if you change the material base you will produce a new man . For example , all you need do is provide education in sexual techniques and then the emotional problems are supposed to disappear . Of course , some problems do go away , but many stay . To create a new man , more is needed than new techniques and changes in the living standard . " The position of the radical Left is that to create a new man , a revolution is needed . The question is , what kind of revolution ? If it is to be a revolution of the classical Marxist type , a violent seizure of the means of production , one wonders whether it would really attack Sweden 's basic problems . It seems more likely that the new man can not be created by such a coup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a deeper insight into character and personality , a richer sense of community and a new challenge to artistic creativity . In a family like the Bergmans ' , one finds what may be the man of the next fifty years  --  secular , enlightened and pragmatic . But he still lacks insight and the inner rhythm of art , and he is still without much sense of community , although he is reaching for it . If he is perhaps too willing to take the second best that the welfare state can offer , he does not seem impervious to arguments for something better , For in Sweden , as in few other places in the world outside Scandinavia , there is a readiness to accept change through the democratic process . Given that openness , classical Marxist revolution might prove a ' romantic shot in the dark , and an unnecessary one . A revolution is needed , butperhaps it should take its time . It could evolve in a subtle dialogue between new institutional arrangements , either introduced by ' the government or by private groups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus the citizen could grow into the revolution . His communal sense , for example , could develop as he gained communal experience . Who owned the means of production would , of course , be important , but it is a question that could be settled democratically and when the time was ripe . The government is already moving in the direction , of communal control of big business . At this writing , Palme is expected to appoint government representatives to the board of Sweden 's twenty largest private companies in order to mesh company policies with national planning . It would be a typical Swedish move . But the revolution must take place not only at the national level but at all levels below  --  familial , social , vocational and municipal . Enlightened social planning must be balanced by strong citizen participation , and supported by schools which help develop the new man . In the work of this revolution , the Swedish Left could find useful employment . ?                  @ @ @
