Some Marine recruiters will sign up almost anyone <P> THE MARINES ARE LOOKING FOR A FEW GOOD MEN . So says the recruiting motto for America 's elite fighting force . But since the draft was abolished in 1973 , the Marines , as well as the other branches of the U.S. armed forces , have been having considerable difficulty filling their ranks . As a result , a Senate armed services subcommittee was told last week , some Marine recruiters sign up criminals , illiterates , men who are physically unfit - almost anyone who walks through the recruiting-office door . <P> Former Sergeant Donald Robinette described how recruiters in northern Ohio falsified high school diplomas and police records to meet the demands for recruits from his commander , Major Klaus Schreiber , who considers himself " the best recruiting officer in the Marine Corps . " Said Robinette : " The pressure never stopped . We were doing everything to get the bodies and they still wanted more . " <P> At one point , Schreiber threatened to break a recruiter 's arm if he failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat was not serious . Said he : " We 're in the Marine Corps . That 's the way we speak . We 're not graduates of the College of the Immaculate Conception . " With considerable pride , Schreiber reported that he managed to raise his staffs performance from 59% of its quota to 100% after he took charge in 1977 . His reward : headquarters increased his quota by 13 percentage points . <P> To meet such demands , ex-recruiters and Marine lawyers from across the country testified that recruiters have gone to such lengths as enlisting a violence-prone youth out of a juvenile home and even signing up a fictitious candidate . To qualify a youth with a long police record , a recruiter would drop the first letter of the candidate 's name so that the police check would turn up no trace of his crimes . Schreiber told recruiters to ask Marine hopefuls leading questions like , " You have n't smoked marijuana , have you ? " Answers , of course , were negative . Some recruiters coach candidates in advance to ensure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who seem sure to fail . Robinette said that one ringer in northern Ohio had taken the test for 15 candidates and was so proficient that he could deliver any score needed . <P> Once enlisted , these unfit Marines constitute a new class of military untouchables . The U.S. Court of Military Appeals has ruled that a fraudulently recruited serviceman can not be court-martialed . Thus the Marines had to drop a case against an enlisted man who was charged with stealing TNT from his unit at the Marine Corps Air Station in Kaneohe , Hawaii , because his recruiter had forged his high school diploma and concealed his juvenile crime record to qualify him for service . <P> According to the Pentagon , nearly 11% of the 74,888 people who joined the Marines in the past two years have been discharged for reasons , ranging from medical disabilities to drug abuse , that should have disqualified them at the time of their enlistment . Congress could solve the problem by bringing back the draft , but this would be highly unpopular and is unlikely .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
