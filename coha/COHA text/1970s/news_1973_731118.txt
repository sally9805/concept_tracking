THE SENATE is expected to approve the compromise bill tomorrow and the House also may act on it during the day . Altho the conferees disclosed the plans for a 10-gallon limit on gas pump sales , Simon refused to confirm or deny the report . According to the congressmen , President Nixon will ask Americans to try to make each 10-gallon purchase last a week . There would be nothing to keep a motorist from coming back for more than one 10-gallon purchase , however . AFTER THE Senate and House conferees reached agreement on the energy bill , Simon said , " I am not sure we legally have the power now to limit sales . " Sen. Henry M. Jackson D. , Wash. , one of the conferees , said that if the new bill becomes law , the 10-gallon limit could be made mandatory with service station operators .

Secretary of the Treasury George Shultz said that the tax is not designed to have any impact on prices paid by consumers for oil . He estimated that from 3 to 5 billion dollars would be raised by the tax during its first year . The administration recommended that the revenues raised by the new tax be put into a new energy development trust fund which would act as a bank for the financing of a wide range of energy and conservation projects . THE OIL PRICE hikes approved today amounted to $1 a barrel , to $5.25 . Dunlop said the increase was necessary because of rapidly rising world prices and the prices of new crude oil production . But he also indicated the council may be reacting to pressure to remove price controls on the petroleum industry altogether .

The White House had indicated earlier that President Nixon was prepared to veto the legislation in its present form .

" THAT BILL IS in deep trouble , " Fred Webber , White House special assistant for congressional affairs , said as he buttonholed Republican members of the conference outside the closed door meeting . Webber said file White House objected to a congressional veto provision which would allow Congress to repeal energy conservation measures put into effect while Congress is away over the Christmas break . Webber said industry complained it should n't be expected to begin a fuel-saving plan which could be overturned the day Congress returns . The emergency energy bill would give Nixion sole power to order gasoline rationing immediately and give Congress veto power over other actions he might take .                    @
