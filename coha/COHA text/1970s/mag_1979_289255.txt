Tenable , not trendy , is the rule <P> For multitudes of happy souls , Santa Claus did not pop down the chimney this year . He squeezed into the mailbox . It was history 's greatest mail-order spending spree , and despite the catalogues ' enticements to decadence and conspicuous frivolity , Americans for the most part ordered up gifts that tended to be more tenable than trendy , disproving the adage that there 's no fool like a Yule fool . Said Bergdorf Goodman Executive Vice President Leonard Hankin : " This was the kind of Christmas where people were investing in things because they were not so sure of what was going to happen to their dollars . " Added Roger Horchow , owner of the zooming eight-year-old The Horchow Collection mail-order firm : " People are looking for good value , not whimsical merchandise . People are buying what they know will cost more later on . " <P> To be sure , catalogue vendors lost no money on such stocking stuffers as a $45 sterling silver Perrier bottle opener with two silver bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $200 King Tut bust was bought by some 7,400 holders of American Express cards . Yves Saint Laurent 's Opium perfume , at $100 an ounce , sold like , well , opium . Beverly Hills ' David Orgell disposed of all 18 of his catalogue-advertised $750 sterling-silver telephones . <P> For the most part , however , mail-order buyers concentrated on lesser gifts that were both of practical use and lasting value . Five-year-old Atlanta-based Kaleidoscope Inc. , which mailed 1 million catalogues , a weight of nine tons , found that an increasing number of women bought not only presents for other people but also a few gifts for themselves . Among Kaleidoscope 's bestsellers : china , glasses , flatware , tablecloths . Also popular were luggage and other travel items . Several cataloguers reported an upsurge in sales of packaged cheese and fruits . A $5 chocolate bar divided into sections marked with their calories and called Sweet Revenge sold well , as did a $600 chocolate Monopoly set . <P> A husband in New York 's Westchester County presented his startled family with a gift-wrapped sack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chain saw so that the boys could provide wood for a warming fireplace to keep the Arabs at bay . The greatest yields from the Sears , Roebuck catalogue were in home improvement lines ( tools , paints , fixtures ) , home furnishings ( bedspreads were big ) and save-work appliances like a microwave oven . <P> But who , with any romance in his/her soul , would present a loved one with a stove ? Better a filmy negligee or even a velour shirt ( both went well this winter ) . Better yet , a Fendi sable coat ( Bergdorf 's catalogue sold three at $18,500 apiece ) , a $500 cashmere robe or any ornament made of gold , the invaluable metal that fetched some $220 an ounce on the London market last week . Tiny gold pendants in the shape of oil barrels went for $850 and solid gold nuggets for $950 . Tiffany 's diamond-studded gold watch was a bargain . Its price : $ 14,500.                   @ @
