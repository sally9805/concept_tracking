The most historic meeting in Manhattan last week was , needless to say , at the United Nations . But across town , NATO was conducting an even more tumultuous and unstatesmanlike session . This NATO was not the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but the equally embattled National Association of Theater Owners . The gloom at the meeting was almost as thick as the cigar smoke . <P> Just two weeks before , yet another Moorish movie palace , Miami 's Olympia , had shut down. * Typically , rural theater chains like Oregon 's Adamson have reported a 30% drop in volume in the past year . In Portland , where business is also dragging , the " nabes " ( the trade term for neighborhood houses ) are now closed except on weekends , and some metropolitan theaters , even in New York 's Times Square area , will be dark until the beginning of the Christmas season . Across the country , weekly movie admissions have steadily and disastrously declined after reaching a peak of 80 million in 1946 . By 1963 , the total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was below 18 million . Though box office prices have more than tripled in the past 25 years , gross revenues are down 25% . <P> Faded Movies . Television is the all-too-familiar villain . By Nielsen 's estimate , the average American adult spends 1,200 hours a year in front of his TV set . By contrast , he logs a mere nine hours a year in moviehouses ( but watches a movie more attentively than the <P> TV screen ) . NATO is concerned about further trouble from the tube ; cable or community-antenna television may soon offer viewers 40 different TV channels , plus pay-TV movies . <P> The economy is partly to blame for the current slump . But , says NATO 's Sumner Redstone , president of an 80-theater Midwest chain , " primarily we 're suffering from the most severe lack of quality motion pictures in the last ten to 15 years . " Many operators make the familiar complaint that there are too few family pictures . What they are waiting for is Son of Love Story , another Airport or a romantic western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fad is not the only reason why so many old movies like National Velvet and Dr. Zhivago are everywhere in revival .
