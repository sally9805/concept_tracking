txt The House of Representatives came close today to defeating the controversial , import-limiting trade bill before it was even debated . The bill will probably be voted on tomorrow , and even leaders of today 's opposition predicted it would pass . In a series of three close votes on procedure , the House finally decided to proceed with the bill under a rule barring amendments , as desired by the leadership and by a majority of the Ways and Means Committee . At one point it seemed that the bill might be dead . The final vote to take up the bill was 203-186 . Although votes on procedural questions do not always exactly reflect sentiment on the legislation itself , several members said they thought this margin roughly reflected the strength of relatively protectionist as against relatively free-trade forces . A Many-Sided Bill The many-sided bill would impose quotas on imports of textiles and shoes and open the way for import limitation on other products where domestic industries can prove injury . It also contains some provisions hacked by the Administration and the forces hacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bill that lead to import restrictions , but the President favors quotas on textiles . After the tense voting on procedure , Representative Wilbur D. Mills , Democrat of Arkansas and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee , opened ' the general debate with a spirited defense of the bill . Vigorous Denial Long a backer of lower trade barriers , he vigorously denied that the bill represented a " 360-'degree turn in United States trade policy " and added : " We have some serious problems from imports , and if we do n't solve them , then the clock will really be turned back . I shudder to think what kind of legislation this Congress will ' pass in two years ' time if we do n't act now to help solve these problems . " He said the bill gave the President all the main changes in trade law that he had asked for and defended the additional provisions , opposed by the Administration . As the day began , the question before the House was the normally routine one of adopting the " rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills . have traditionally been considered // under a closed rule , barring amendments . As the members ocnvened they were made aware that , if the closed rule should be defeated in the initial vote , they would have a chanoe to vote on an amended rule  --  one apparently without , precedent in the long history of the House . Offered by Representative Sam M. Gibbons , Democrat of Florida , it would permit only amendments to strike out individual portions of the bill , but no amendments to add or alter provisions . This appealed , for example . to members from New England who. though strongly favoring import restraints on textiles and shoes , equally strongly oppose a provision that would bar any shift from a quota system as the means of limiting imports of oil . It appealed , as well , to those members who oppose a closed rule on principle . In any event , the first test of the day found the House voting  --  tentatively as it turned out  --  to defeat the rule . The vote was 204-1S9 and , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be dead . The next vote came on the Gibbons motion . Mr. Mills told the House that , if it carried , he would have to reconvene the Ways and Means Committee at some unspecified time to get new instructions . He said he could not bring up the bill under the modified rule without such instructions ? an implication that there might be no bill at all . According to Mr. Gibbons afterward , this statement was , decisive . There was evidently not a majority in the House who wanted no trade bill at all this year . With a number of members switching sides from the first vote , the Gibbons motion was narrowly defeated , 201-192 . Then , under the rules , the vote was taken again on the original closed rule and it carried , 203-186 . The opposition forces were still planning strategy tonight on how to take advantage of the procedure that permits a single catch-all amendment . This is known as a " motion to recommit with instructions " and may be offered just before the vote on final passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ways and Means Committee bill the original Administration hill with two additions  --  quotas on textiles and a new system of tax incentives for exports .
