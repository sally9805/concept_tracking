txt Gerald Marker of Seattle has been buying gold jewelry but wants to get into silver bars . Robert Aduddell of Chicago likes art prints . Steven Malycke of Ohio looks for land . these men are part of what seems to be a growing phenomenon , a product of the inflation psychology infecting Americans across the country and across the income spectrum . They are " hedging . " Trusting the dollar will not protect them , they say . Putting money in the bank is a loser 's game , they say . Rejecting stocks and other traditional investments as too dependent on the nation 's economic growth , they buy things : Gold , houses , coins , stamps , violins , old tools , antiques , art , old model trains , land , cars ? anything with value that might appreciate faster than the dollar shrinks . A New Yorker who hedges with stamps and art prints patted a briefcase containing a complete set of one newer nation 's stamps , purchased for $1,780 . " I have no interest in stamps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe-deposit vault . " Why ? " When 1 was a kid , " he explained , " the office manager was named Frank . In ' 31 he bought an annuity . He paid every month , and those were hard dollars . He went without things , dreaming that with his annuity he could stop after 20 years , do what he wanted , travel , anything . " That $100 a month looked like a lot in 1931 . When it matured in 1951 he could n't even pay his rent with $100 a month . All his sweat was a joke , and we really did n't even have inflation here then . I do n't want to be gypped like he was . " This man buys and sells for cash , which makes it easy for him &to; avoid paying sales taxes or even income taxes on his gains . " If I 've got stamps or Krugerrands or Turkish snuff boxes , I go to a dealer and say , ' How much do you give me for this in cash ? ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside in my car and do n't bother asking for my Social Security number . " He figures that the value of his stamps went up about 25 percent last year . The prices of art prints have soared so high he can not afford them any more . No one can say with certainty how much of the nation 's savings goes into such hedging , or how much the economy is distorted in the process . Nor is it clear how successful all of the attempts at hedging will prove to be in the long run . Not all real estate values have soared , and some of today 's " collectibles " could turn out to be tomorrow 's solid waste disposal problem . What is certain is that hedging is widespread , that prices of favored objects are climbing , and that the resulting demand may be one reason land and home prices continue to climb even as interest rates , which in theory slow such demand , are soaring . Mr. Marker of Seattle said he had several thousand dollars in gold jewelry . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved , " he said . " I have read where silver is selling for $6 an ounce now , will go to $20 an ounce by 1985 . My wife and I would like to buy several 200-ounce silver bars ? the ultimate conversation piece . " " What I homed in on was a class of Indian prints , " said Mr. Aduddell , who teaches economics at Loyola University in Chicago- " This class was commissioned by the Department of the Interior in 1837 with 420 prints to the series , handdrawn and lithographed . and all numbered . The ones I bought about eight years ago for $80 can now be sold for about $350 . " Mr. Aduddell studies antiques magazines and attends shows to find more " collectibles " ? items that have a ready market and are of collector 's quality . A architect in Florida calls his land investment " my bank account . " He said that with $5,000 down he bought a $25,000 site in central Florida three years ago and was recently offered $75,000 for the land . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Ford Pickup Harold Blackburn , the owner of Blackburn 's Spa in Attleboro , Mass. , bought a 1938 Ford pickup for a hedge a year ago . " 1 paid $3,000 for it , and I bet I could get more for it today , " he said . " In the six years since I bought my first land , I 've seen a paper profit of more than 200 percent , " says Mr. Malycke , an associate professor of music at Mount Union College south of Cleveland . He recently bought 50 acres of woodland near Canton and is still looking for more . In New Orleans , Arnold Cooper , who has been selling real estate for a year , said that for him , putting money in highinterest savings means " you have to tie it up far a certain amount of time without touching it ? I figured I 'd lose anywhere from a quarter to a half of my money over time . " His solution was to buy property on which he could take a second mortgage , and he spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In five years I have to come up with $28,500 , so I 'm not worried , " he said . " That building with inflation will go up in value and in five years I 'll refinance the building with the new value . If it 's worth $120,000 , I 'll borrow 80 percent or $90,000 and pay off both what 's left of the first mortgage and the second . " Fred Smith of North Bend , Wash. , puts his money in recreational land . " I have ski area lots as my hedge , " he said . " I 'm going to sit on them . In a few years , Snoqualmie Pass is really going to be highly developed with new hotels and resort facilities . I 'm waiting for that time . I can not lose . " The New Yorker who collects stamps has studied other hedging alternatives : " If you can afford 8100.000 or $500,000 , fine ; there are musical instruments . Now old tools that carpenters or cobblers used are hot ? adzes , things you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
