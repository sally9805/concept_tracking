During his Army physical , a psychiatrist inquired : " Do you think you can kill ? " <P> " I do n't know about strangers , " replied the draftee . " But friends , yes . " <P> For more than four decades , Oscar Levant slew his friends-with insults , wisecracks and backchat . When he died at 65 last week , Levant had become a Hollywood legend : the Oscar that no one could win . <P> It was an image that Levant nurtured like a hothouse nightshade . The son of a Pittsburgh jeweler , he dropped out of high school at 15 to seek a concert pianist 's career in New York . He caromed from dance bands to luncheon orchestras , waiting for his big break . Whenever opportunity knocked , Levant immediately bit its hand . Upon greeting George Gershwin , for example , Oscar went Wilde : " George , if you had it to do all over again , would you fall in love with yourself ? " <P> The composer laughed off the insult - possibly because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Levant soon became a freeloading guest of George and Ira Gershwin until Leonore , Ira 's wife , ordered him out of the house . Levant rose , paused , then sat down . " I 'm not going , " he told Leonore . " Why ? " " Because , " he mourned , " I have no place to go . " Oscar stayed another two years . <P> Eventually he found another place : George S. Kaufman 's . Mrs. Kaufman finally hinted : " I thought the servants were beginning to look at you peculiarly , and I know you have n't any money , so I gave them $5 and said it was from you . " Oscar exploded : " $5 ! You should have given them $10 . Now they 'll say I 'm stingy . " <P> It was a symbiotic relationship : Oscar and his hosts dined out on remarks like that . Levant swiftly became a fixture at Beverly Hills parties : the lap dog with rabies . Though he continued to play and compose ( he once studied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very seriously - except , of course , by Oscar . His classical composition had a sweet , derivative aura , reminiscent of movie scores . ( He wrote several , including a mini-opera for Charlie Chan at the Opera . ) His pianistic enthusiasm was showy but , except for Gershwin 's music , Levant tended to pound the instrument like the back of an old crony . <P> Indeed , his concerts were less appreciated by critics than by hoods . Mobster Frank Costello was one of his biggest fans . In New York 's Lewisohn Stadium , Levant annually played Gershwin to a bench of discriminating cauliflower ears . <P> But as the Don Quixote of insult comics , Levant was unexcelled . He became a regular on the radio panel Information Please , where his cranky voice identified almost any piece of music after one bar . His sallow , discontented expression became familiar to audiences when he appeared in a series of films . The movies varied from An American in Paris through Humoresque to the Gershwin bio Rhapsody in Blue , in which he played himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the man whose pan was not dead but dying - of pain distinctly complicated by ennui . It was a role that he later expanded in three autobiographies and a series of TV talk shows with his long-suffering second wife , June .
