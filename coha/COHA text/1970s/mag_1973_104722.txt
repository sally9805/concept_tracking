There is much of different worlds in Tuscaloosa , Ala. , the best and the worst of the Old and the New South , the drowsy weariness of a rural town gone to decay resisting change and the ebullience of an academic community excited by progress . The polarization is captured in essence along University Boulevard , one of the city 's main streets , running between the downtown area and the University of Alabama , a black-topped conduit from crumbling decrepitude to the Age of Aquarius . // On the intercity section of the boulevard , near the dime store , across from City Hall and right up from the Chamber of Commerce , there is a rusting link to the past , a nagging reminder by the name of Robert Shelton , Imperial Wizard of the United Klans of America , which is an organization of a bunch of Klux . Shelton runs a printing shop in downtown Tuscaloosa. // Not far from his colorful window display of flags  --  the Klan 's , the South 's and America 's  --  is the University of Alabama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tide of integration . Since then we 've polluted the moon , dressed men in high heels and put a mustache on Dick Tracy . The university has done the unexpected , too . Last Saturday night it started four blacks in a basketball game on archrival Auburn 's home court , an occurrence that left Shelton feeling as glum as if he had just seen his bookkeeper driving a Cadillac. // Alabama beat Auburn 76-64 , augmenting its hold on first place in the Southeastern Conference and running its overall record to 10-1 . The team has beaten Florida State and Southern California , and its lone defeat came against Wake Forest in the second game of the season before it had jelled or established a starting lineup . // When Alabama reorganized its basketball program five years ago it sent to Transylvania not for a vampire but for a coach named C. M. Newton who had labored for 12 seasons at Transylvania College in Lexington , Ky . In his first year at ' Bama the school captured four victories and Wendell Hudson . Getting Hudson , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a winning season . As a junior in ' 71- ' 72 , Hudson was SEC player of the year in two polls , and Alabama finished 18-8 after challenging for the conference title . // " Before this season a lot of people wondered if coach would play four blacks , " says Hudson , now the SEC 's leading scorer . " The best answer he gave them was that he was going to put the best five men out there . It just happened that four of them are black . I liked it here from the start , although I got some trouble from both sides , white and black . But I could tell that the coaches really wanted to have a winning basketball program , and it did n't matter what color you were . " // Newton played basketball for Adolph Rupp at the University of Kentucky . An avuncular man who smokes a pipe , he goes down smoothly with his players . During practice he adopts a jocular tone , correcting mistakes more by intimation than by direct advice . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him when I first came here that the one thing I liked most was that I was n't treated any different than any of the other players , " says Hudson . " He jumped on me just like the others . " // " People back home do n't talk much about it , " says senior Glenn Garrett , who is from outside Selma , Ala. and the only white in the starting lineup . " We 're winning . And the four blacks we 've got , they 're quality people . I guess it was good to start out with somebody like Hudson because he fits in with everybody . " // Hudson helped recruit the other black players on the team : reserve Ernie Odom and starters Charles Cleveland , Ray Odums and the newest and most impressive of all , freshman Leon Douglas , a 6 ' 9 " pivot built along the lines of the Empire State Building . Douglas can hold his own with most any big man in the country , especially on defense , where he has a proclivity for blocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the thing we lacked was a center who could reject some shots , " says Hudson . " Now nobody is driving . " // Alabama fretted that Douglas would not be ready for the internecine meeting with Auburn . He spent Wednesday and Thursday in the infirmary , battling the flu . On Friday he looked at his wasted body and claimed the flu had won . " I can see my ribs , " he said . // Meanwhile a wayward tourist might have assumed the town of Auburn had adopted " 17-16 " as its motto . This and other graffiti alluding to Auburn 's football victory over Alabama last season were plastered all over the city . Alabama faithful countered by telling Auburn jokes to all who would listen . Sample : " An Auburn man with a frog on his head walked into a doctor 's office . Said the frog : ' Doc , can you take this wart off me ? ' " // As it was , Auburn was looking at Douglas ' ribs for most of the night . He blocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game in the second half . " I quit coaching so much and let them play , " kidded Newton , who had worried at halftime because his team held a slim five-point lead . " I thought our coaching sort of handicapped them in the first half . We kept quiet in the second . " // Hudson finished with 10 points . Cleveland , only a sophomore , scored 15 and played both guard and forward , and Odums finished with 20 and seven assists . Nicknamed Flash , Odums played defense as if he were a store detective after a woman wearing a hat with a dangling price tag . // The first seven players on the team are from Alabama , a state which once had the reputation of producing basketball players who had the reliability of a motel soft-drink machine . Now Newton reaps the best of a good crop , although he rues two prize dishes that got away , Allen Murphy to Louisville and Clarence Jones to Memphis State . Right now the talk around Tuscaloosa is that Alabama has a good chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to be the best in the state . C. M. plus T. R. might mean the NCAA. // As a recruiter Newton has some provocative lures . The team plays in the Memorial Coliseum , which seats 15,043 people , and lives in Paul Bryant Hall , the luxurious athletic dormitory featuring a fountain and flaming torches at its entrance . At the training table the gladiators eat steak . " Once in awhile we have lobster or stuffed flounder , " says sixth man Paul Ellis . " But the neat things are the bathrooms ; they have heated tiles so your feet do n't get cold in the morning . " // Now that Alabama has eliminated its cold feet , all of its worlds are closer together . Nicely . Even law and order is a winner . Last week someone broke into the Alabama equipment room and stole a basketball . He got the only ball in the room with a leaky valve , leaving the thief as disappointed as Robert Shelton . The Wizard says he 'll never go to another game  --  but those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
