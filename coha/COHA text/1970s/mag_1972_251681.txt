Whatever the eventual outcome of the war in Viet Nam , historians may argue for years about just why the U.S. became involved . Marshall McLuhan , the 1960s ' mystagogue of the media , has proposed something of an explanation-or at any rate , a suggestive metaphor for the collision that has occurred in Indochina . <P> By McLuhan 's reasoning , " there are no raw materials in that area Indochina that could possibly tempt American imperialists , and there is no meaning to ' containment of Communism , ' since Communism in Iowa and in Cairo and in Peking and in Moscow has totally different meanings . " In an unpublished article , McLuhan sees Viet Nam as a " resonant interval " or a " massive interface between a Westernizing Orient and an Orientalizing West . " The entire Western world , McLuhan argues , is now turning inward upon itself-in the old Oriental pattern-while the Orient " has been increasingly engaged in an outer trip , aided by Western technology . " McLuhan believes that " as the complementary areas of the Orient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area of interface between them has necessarily become agitated in the extreme . Korea and Viet Nam and other ' trouble spots ' could then be observed as intervals of dissonance , which actually manifest the perturbations originating elsewhere . These ' trouble spots , ' then , are like the interval between the wheel and the axle ; they are areas of touch and they are where the action is , but they are not the action itself . The real action is taking place inside the massive Oriental and Western entities , which are undergoing total revolution and reversal of roles at very high speeds . " <P> Everybody got that ?
