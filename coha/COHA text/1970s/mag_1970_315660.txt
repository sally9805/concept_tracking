The Rev. Joseph H. Jackson would most emphatically disagree with Marshall 's conviction that the Gospel prescribes revolution . Jackson , pastor of the big Olivet Baptist Church on Chicage 's South Side and perennial president of the National Baptist Convention U.S.A. , Inc. ( he claims 6,000,000 members ) , is in his mid-60s . But there is more than a generation gap between him and Calvin Marshall . Jackson bitterly opposed Martin Luther King 's civil-disobedience campaign , and has so vigorously quashed liberal opposition within his denomination that half a million members ( including King ) left in 1961 to form the Progressive National Baptist Convention , Inc . He was one of the few black leaders to endorse Richard Nixon ( with little effect ) in the last election ; outspokenly dedicated to " law and order , " he won the " Patriot of the Year " award from Ultra-Right-winger Billy James Hargis in 1968 . <P> Jackson earnestly preaches national unity . " The most important thing now , " he says , " is to save the nation , in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Probably few blacks , however , share his opinion that the civil rights struggle is disruptive of that unity . " It was supposed to be a struggle for first-class citizenship , not for getting Whitey , " Jackson maintains . " Those who wanted their rights are being sold another bill of goods now . There are Negroes who believe their mission is to destroy America . " <P> Rugged Way . Many of Jackson 's notions seem to have been shaped by his rugged background : a Mississippi farm boy , he had to teach himself arithmetic , spelling and reading while leading cows to pasture or doing other chores . He feels that the black churches have had an equally hard struggle . His own convention , he points out , was founded nine decades before the cry for Black Power . " They believed we had an opportunity . They never took the time to keep a white man from preaching . They believed in fair competition . They never asked for reparations . They built their own churches with their own hands and their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that same initiative to their economic struggle : " We must learn how to organize our capital , harness our earnings and set them to work for us . " <P> Though he is broad-minded in some areas of theology ( he is a graduate of liberal Colgate Rochester Divinity School ) , Jackson has a view of the Negro recalling the old-fashioned suffering servant image from Isaiah . Christianity , he argues , permits protest against unjust laws but not rebellion against civil order . " The difference between Negro Christians and white Christians . " says Jackson , " is the meaning of the cross of Jesus Christ . Our forefathers were cross-bearers . They believed in it . You ca n't build a great church preaching hate , envy , and revenge , and sending the people out on the street after the service mad at the world . No matter how nonviolent , civil disobedience lays the ground for civil hatred and the desire to destroy . They took from the civil rights struggle the religious faith that went with it .
