" You dirty lover , you dirty lover ! " right-wing Republicans shouted at Nelson Rockefeller when he tried to address the 1964 G.O.P. Convention . Aside from challenging their favorite , Barry Goldwater , Rockefeller had committed the sin of divorcing his wife of 32 years and marrying another woman , also divorced . <P> In the twelve years since that scene , divorce has become widespread , almost common . Last year U.S. divorces exceeded 1 million for the first time . It is thus interesting , but hardly surprising , that divorce is no longer a taboo and has virtually vanished as an issue in national politics . No one could care less whether Betty Ford was divorced from her first husband before she married Jerry ( nor whether the President 's former rival , Ronald Reagan , got a divorce and remarried ) . And without more than a momentary pause , Ford and his advisers put Robert Dole on the ticket even though he was divorced in 1972.                @ @ @ @ @
