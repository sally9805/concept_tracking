 | Ever since it was announced that an actor had been invited to give the commencement address at one of the most prestigious medical schools in the country , people have been wondering ? why get someone who only pretends to be a doctor when you could get a real one ? Some people have suggested that this school had done everything it could to show you how to be doctors and then in a moment of desperation had brought in someone who could show you how to act like one . I am not a doctor . But you have asked me , and all in all I think you made a wonderful choice . I say that because I probably first came to the attention of this graduating class through a character on television that I 've played and helped write for the past seven years , a surgeon by the name of Hawkeye Pierce . He 's a remarkable person , this Hawkeye , and if you have chosen somehow to associate his character with your own graduation from medical school , then I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are reaching out toward a very human kind of doctoring . And a very real kind of doctor . We did n't make him Hawkeye up . He really lived as several doctors who struggled to preserve life 25 years ago during the Korean War . In fact , it 's because Hawkeye Pierce is based on real doctors that there is something especially engaging about him . He has a sense of humor and yet he 's serious . . . he 's impertinent and yet he has feeling . . . he 's human enough to make mistakes and yet he hates death enough to push himself past his own limits in order to save lives . In many ways he 's the doctor patients want to have and doctors want to be . But he 's not an idealization . Finding himself in a war , he 's sometimes angry , sometimes cynical , sometimes a little nuts . He 's not a magician who can come up with an instant cure for a rare disease without sweating and ruining his makeup . He knows he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of disaster ? alive to his own mortality . If this image of that very human , very caring doctor is attractive to you ? if it 's ever touched you for a moment as something to reach for in your own life ? then I 'm here to cheer you on . Do it . Go for it . Be skilled , be learned , be aware of the dignity of your calling ... but please do n't ever lose sight of your own  | simple humanity in the process . Unfortunately , that may not be so easy . You 're entering a special place in society . People will be awed by your expertise . You 'll be placed in a position of privilege . You 'll live well , people will defer to you , call you by your title ? and it may be hard to remember that the word " doctor " is not actually your first name . I know what this is like to some extent because in some ways you and I are alike . We both study the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you through medicine and I through laughter . But we both try to reduce suffering . We 've both learned difficult disciplines that have taken years to master , and we 've both dedicated ourselves to years of hard work . And we both charge a lot . We live in a society that has decided to reward my profession and yours ? when we succeed in them ? very highly . It can sometimes be easy to forget that the cab driver also works 14 or 15 hours a day and is also drained of energy when he 's through . It 's easy to think that because our society grants us privilege , we 're entitled to it . Privilege feels good , but it can be intoxicating . As good doctors , I hope you 'll be able to keep yourselves free of toxins . It 's no wonder , though , that people will hold you in awe . I know I do . You 've spent years in a grueling effort to know the structure and process of human life . I ca n't imagine a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complexities within complexities , and there has been more pressure placed on you in four years than most people would be willing to take in a lifetime . I stand here in utter amazement at what you 've accomplished . And I congratulate you . I only ask one thing of you : possess your skills , but do n't be possessed by them . Certainly your training has encouraged you to see the human side of your work and you 've examined the doctor-patient relationship . But still . the enormity of your task has required you to focus to such an extent on technique and data that you may not have had time enough to face your feelings along the way . You 've had to toughen yourself to death . From your first autopsy , when you may have been sick or cried or just been numb , you 've had to inure yourself to death in order to be useful to the living . But I hope in the process you have n't done too good a job of burying that part of you that hurts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be absorbed in technique . When I write for M*A*S*H , I 'm always writing with what I hope is compassion and feeling , about people in crisis . And yet one day I found myself talking to someone who was in a real crisis and real pain ? and I remember thinking , " This would make a great story . " Both of these things ? becoming set apart and becoming your skill ? can make it tough to be compassionate . All right , that 's my diagnosis . Here 's my prescription . I 'd like to suggest to you . just in case you have n't done it lately , that this would be a very good time to give some thought to just exactly what your values are and then to figure out how you 're going to live by them . It can be a startling experience when you try to rank your values though . Just ask yourself what 's the most important thing in the world to you . Your work ? Your family ? Your money ? Your country ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? ( I do n't need a show of hands on this . ) Then when you get the answer to that , ask yourself how much time you actually spend on your number-one value ? and how much time you spend on what you thought was number five ... or number ten . What in fact is the thing you value most ? It may not be easy to decide . We live in a time that seems to be split about its values . In fact it seems to be schizophrenic . For instance , all across the country this month commencement speakers are saying to graduating classes , " We look to you for tomorrow 's leaders . " That 's because today 's leaders are all in jail . Maybe we can afford to let politicians operate in a moral 82 vacuum , but we ca n't afford to let doctors operate under those conditions . You know how we 're feeling these days as the powerand-fuel monopoly has its way with us . Well , you people graduating today are entering a very select group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be careful not to abuse this power that you have over the rest of us . You need to know what you care about most and what you care about least . And you need to know now . You will be making life-and-death decisions , often making them under stress and with great speed . The time to make your tender choices is not in the heat of the moment . When you 're making your list , let me urge you to put people first . And I include in that not just people , but that which exists between people . I suggest to you that what makes people know they 're alive ? and in some cases keeps them alive ? is not merely the interaction of the parts of their bodies , but the interaction of their selves with other selves . Not just people , but what goes on between people . Let me challenge you . With all your study , you can name all the bones in my body . You can read my X-rays like a telegram . But can you read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertainty in my face ? If I tell you where it hurts , can you hear in my voice where I ache ? I show you my body , but I bring you my person . Can you see me through your reading glasses ? Will you tell me what you 're doing , and in words I can understand ? Will you tell me when you do n't know what to do ? Can you face your own fear , your own uncertainty ? When in doubt , can you call in help ? These are things to consider even if you do n't deal directly with patients . If you 're in research , administration .  | if you write ? no matter what you do ? eventually there is always going to be a patient at the end of your decisions . Now , of course , everyone is for this in principle . Who 's against people ? But it 's harder when you get specific . Will you be the kind of doctor who cares more about the case than the person ? ( " Nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at three . " " How 's the fractured femur in Room 208 ? " ) You 'll know you 're in trouble if you find yourself wishing they would mail you their liver in a plain brown envelope . Where does money come on your list ? Will it be the sole standard against which you reckon your success ? How much will it guide you in relating to your patients ? Do patients in a clinic need less of your attention than private patients ? Are they , for instance , less in need of having things explained to them ? Where will your family come on your list ? How many days and nights " weeks and months , will you separate yourself from them before you realize that you 've removed yourself from an important part of your life ? And if you 're a male doctor , how will you relate to women ? Women as patients , as nurses , as fellow doctors ? and later as students . Will you be able to respect your patient 's right to know and make decisions about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? or as handmaidens ? And if the day comes when you are teaching , what can young women medical students expect from you ? Questionnaires filled out by women at 41 medical schools around the country have revealed a distressing pattern . The women were often either ignored in class or simply not taken seriously as students . They were told that they were only there to find a husband and that they were taking the places of men , who would then have to go out and become chiropractors . ( Logic is not the strong point of sexism . ) They were often told that women just did n't belong in medicine . And at times they were told this by the very professors who were grading them . They would be shown slides of Playboy nudes during anatomy lectures ? to the accompaniment of catcalls and wisecracks from male students . And in place of discussions about their work , they would often hear a discussion of their appearance . These are reports from 41 different medical schools . I 'm dwelling on this because it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal and intense test of humane behavior . It is a crucible for decency . I hope you men will work to grant the same dignity to your female colleagues that you yourselves enjoy . It may seem strange to rank the things you care about , but there is n't an area of your work that wo n't be affected by what you decide to place a high value on and what you decide does n't count . Decide now . Well , that 's my prescription . I 've given you kind of a big pill to swallow , but I think it 'll make you feel better . And if not ? well , look , I 'm only human . I congratulate you and please let me thank you for taking on the enormous responsibility that you have ? and for having the strength to have made it to this day . I do n't know how you 've managed to learn it all . But there is one more thing you can learn about the body that only a non-doctor would tell you ? and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is connected to the heart hone ? and do n't let them come apart . Thank you .
