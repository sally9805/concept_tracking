Even by Ulster standards , it was a crime of surpassing brutality . Early Monday evening a red minibus was routinely carrying twelve workers home from their jobs at the John Compton Ltd. textile factory in violence-ridden South Armagh ( TIME , Jan. 12 ) . Suddenly , just outside the village of Whitecross , the bus was stopped by a group of masked , heavily armed men . The workers and their driver were lined up against the vehicle , and the lone Roman Catholic among them was sent away . The rest , all Protestants , were then gunned down in a withering hail of automatic fire . Ten died instantly . At week 's end the badly wounded survivor remained in serious condition at a nearby hospital . In its methodical ruthlessness and cold-blooded efficiency , the slaughter was one of the worst episodes in Northern Ireland 's tragic history . <P> Gruesome Weight . The next day an anonymous caller telephoned the Belfast Telegraph and , in the name of the South Armagh Republican Action Force-a branch of the Provisional Irish Republican Army-claimed responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caller said , in retaliation for the assassination the previous night of five Catholics , apparently by Protestant extremists . In what constitutes sad testimony to the endless cycle of terror and reprisal in Ulster , those murders were , in turn , thought to be in retaliation for three recent pub bombings by the Provisional I.R.A . that killed three and injured 57 . In all , 20 people have died in sectarian violence in Northern Ireland since New Year 's Eve . The bloodshed added gruesome weight to recent warnings by political leaders that 1976 would see an increase in violence . <P> Responsible Protestant and Catholic leaders are pleading for restraint . " The blood lust which is ripping Armagh must be stopped before the whole of Ulster is engulfed by murder madness , " said Thomas Passmore , Grand Master of Belfast 's Orange Lodge . William Cardinal Conway , Ireland 's Roman Catholic primate , described the Whitecross killings as " spitting in the face of Christ . " Added a deeply pessimistic editorial in Dublin 's Irish Times : " The headless horseman is driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Seek and Destroy . Britain 's Secretary of State for Northern Ireland , Merlyn Rees-the man responsible for maintaining peace in the province - called the murders " the worst single sectarian killing in Ulster history . " Rees was immediately pushed to take action to halt the terrorism and restore confidence in the government 's ability to maintain security . Glen Barr , a spokesman for the Ulster Defense Association , warned that Protestant paramilitary groups are under " intense pressure " from the rank and file to go on an all-out military offensive against the I.R .
