txt ED KALANKE has never advertised his business ? his small construction firm is n't even listed in the Yellow Pages . But Kalanke could n't be busier . He says he could take his telephone off the hook tomorrow and still work full-time through the end of the year . His jobs are scheduled seven months in advance . Word-of-mouth advertising has brought in all the business lie can handle because Kalanke is what some might consider an endangered species . He is a skilled craftsman , a carpenter , capable of duplicating and repairing wood trim on a Victorian-era house as well as handling all sorts of custom remodeling . " You can not find decent help these days . There are very few all-around skilled carpenters , " Kalanke says with a shrug . THE DEMAND for skilled craftsmen ? though artisan may be a better term for those who repair decorative plaster molding , restore stained glass windows , or forge ornamental ironwork ? has increased in recent years with the greater interest in restoring and preserving vintage houses . Quality restoration can retain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern amenities , according to Wilbert Hasbrouck , an architect and head of Historic Researches , 1900 S. Prairie Av . " We have a lot of architects living in this neighborhood , " said Megs Langdon , former president of the Sheffield Neighbors Association . " They originally were all for gutting the inside and leaving the exteriors tof older houses , but now most have come around to restoration . We have some who have become real // purists . " There are no national statistics on the number of craftsmen or their specialties , said Clem Labine , editor of the Old House Journal , one of the new publications meeting the increasing interest in restoration . But any novice attempting restoration knows good craftsmen often seem elusive . When Les Brownlee , director of community relations for the Chicago Board of Education , and his wife bought an old rooming house in Evanston several years ago , they had no intention of doing a complete restoration . " WE HAD N'T planned to do any of that , " Brownlee said . " We were just going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architect told them that the house had been designed by the firm of ? Frank Lloyd Wright and that Wright had signed the plans . The Brownlees decided to try to correct the years of abuse ? for example , repair the lead ? glass windows . ' The problem was trying to find ' someone who did this type of work , " Brownlee recalled . " We tried the Yellow Pages without much success . Finally we were referred to someone who knew about a place that did satisfactory work . " But most of the places said they - do n't do that kind of work anymore . My wife went down a whole list of glaziers in the Yellow Pages , easily three dozen , " Brownlee said . FINDING A competent craftsman can indeed be a problem for the ordinary homeowner , Hasbrouck said . " Oftentimes , they are at the mercy of people who . offer to work beyond their expertise , " lie said . Kalanke learned carpentry In Berlin , where he was an apprentice before coming to this country in 1953 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ilemphill , a North Shore builder , for 18 years before going into business for himself . Ile said he enjoys working on older homes because they have more charm and offer a challenge . " Like fixing wood trim ? If you ca n't replace it with standard molding , then you have to use whatever you can , chisel or pocketknife , to make a duplicate , " Kalanke said . " New construction ? it 's always the same thing . " KALANKE BLAMES the shortage of skilled carpenters on modern builders who mass produce homes and an apprenticeship program that starts train ' ing youths too late . " It 's a good apprentice program here but they should start learning the trade as young as 16 . If you do n't start learning till you 're 18 or 20 , you ca n't afford the low wages ? you 're married or have to buy a car , " he said . Frank Drehobl , of Drehobl Brothers Art Glass Co. , also bemoans the lack of a suitable training program for those interested in learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gem-like lead-glass window in turn-of-the-century design for a historic Chicago home . He learned his skills from two Europeantrained craftsmen who worked in his father 's shop here . SOME SKILLS seem to be on the verge of becoming extinct . " In the Northeast , for example , we have a problem with brownstone restoration , " said Labine . Sandstone does not age well and deteriorates in time . Restoration Involves chipping away some of the stone and preserving the exterior with a stuccolike mix . " We 're talking about a sculptor-slashartisan who is literally sculpting a brownstone front , " he said . ' This kind of work is done by elderly Italian gentlemen . There is n't a one under the age of 55 . " But it 's a mistake to think all artisans are elderly or European-trained , said Hasbrouck , whose firm is supervising the restoration of a six-room kitchen area of the historic Glessner House at 1800 S. Prairie Av . " I DO N'T WANT to give the impression that the only sldiled craftsman is an 82-year-old German carpenter , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we also see relatively young persons who are moving into an area of craftsmanship . " The reproductions of antique window locks and other brass hardware needed for the restoration of Glessner House are being cast by a 25-year-old man who does the work as a second job , Hasbrouck said . Labine also sees a revival in certain crafts ? lead-glass window work , wrought iron work , and blacksmithing . A new program has been set up in New York City to train apprentices in the arts of exterior building maintenance . " Now that we have landmark designations , we have to figure out how to protect and maintain the facade of a building , " he said . IIASBROUCK SAID rising costs of new construction will make restoration economically more feasible in the future , which will , in turn , attract new artisans . " Five years ago , restoration cost a lot more than new construction , " Hasbrouck said . " Now , if a building is worth saving , it 's no more expensive to restore . " " The real problem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compile a list of specialists in the areas of restoration . " Some neighborhood groups do keep track of skilled specialists . The Lincoln Park Conservation Association has kept files on craftsmen since the 1950s . " TILE LIST IS as comprehensive as It could be , " said Joan Martin , executive director of the group . " I can meet 95 per cent of the requests for information by calling one of our members and asking , ' Who did you use for this ? ' or ' Do you know anyone who had this done ? ' " " There were so many fly-by-night operators that when we found a good person , we wanted to keep track of them , " said Mrs. Langdon , explaining why the Sheffield group also keeps lists of craftsmen . Of course , locating an artisan does not guarantee swift completion of the desired work . Kalanke said he already has jobs lined up for next spring , and Drehobl tells customers even minor repair work may take four weeks . " There 's a definite need , " Drehobl said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
