txt A labor economist , a mailman , an engineer and 10 other men  --  all married  --  were ordained as Roman Catholic deacons tonight by John Cardinal Dearden , Archbishop of Detroit , filling an office that had been in disuse for more than a thousand years . They were among the first American laymen to complete training for the permanent diaconate , which was restored by Pope Paul VI in 1967 and established in this country the following year . The ordination of the 13 men brought to 28 the number of permanent deacons now serving in the United States . The new deacons range in age from 36 to 50 and have been studying evenings for two years to qualify for the part-time , unsalaried posts . They will be able to preach , administer baptism and perform most other functions of priests except the saying of mass , hearing of confessions and giving of last rites . But the men , who will keep their secular jobs , stressed that their ministry would include contact with friends and associates . People at their places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in them upon learning they were to become deacons . " I really think my most important role will be in somebody 's kitchen , over a beer or a cup of coffee , " said A. Frederick , an insurance company manager . People can identify with clergymen who are family men and have similar problems , he explained . With 13 children of his own , Mr. indicated that lie believed he had solid experience . The diaconate was restored on the recommendation , of the Second Vatican Council partly to bridge what was described as a gap between the clergy and laity . The order was also seen as // a partial solution to a shortage of priests in many areas , particularly in Latin America . In the early Christian era , deacons , who could be married , supervised church financial affairs and undertook acts of charity , such as visiting the sick and distributing alms to the poor . However , since the Middle Ages , the diaconate ' had been merely a temporary step for seminarians preparing for ordination as priests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deacons will not proceed to the priesthood . In this country , permanent deacons must be at least 35 years old . Single men may not marry ; widowers may not remarry . At least 75 per cent of the 430 candidates now in training at 15 centers throughout the country are married . Ten percent are undergoing intensive training to be full-time deacons . Many of these are retired men in their 50 's . Wives Give Approval ? The average age of the candidates is about 45 . At least half have college educations and most have been active laymen in the church . Their backgrounds vary conconsiderably , but many are in the business world and display the confidence of men used to being in charge . Nevertheless , all the Detroit deacons needed support from their wives ? it is required . In fact , their spouses accompanied them to the altar tonight at the Blessed Sacrament Cathedral and affirmed their " wholehearted " approval of the ordination . Mrs. William Lenny , whose husband is a religious education coordinator , told a visitor she was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their four children had taken it in stride . Their 6-year-old daughter addressed Mr. Lenny as " Father Daddy " and tells neighbors he is " studying to be a Pope . ' As part of their training , the men have been visiting the sick , reading liturgy in church and assuming other tasks they will perform as ordained deacons . Few Blacks Involved According to the Most Rev. Ernest L. linterkoefler , Bishop of Charleston , S. C. , who heads the bishops committee on the American diaconate program , congregations have received the future deacons well , perhaps , he said , because the people have become accustomed to the fairly recent appearance in the altar of " temporary " deacons preparing , for priesthood . Very few blacks have joined the diaconate program but church officials are optimistic that more will become interested . In an effort to deal with special needs , the diocese in Chicago has set up ' three separate programs , for blacks , Chicanos and whites . The 15 training centers vary in content and length of program . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men study such subjects as theology , liturgy , sociology and homiletics ( preaching ) for two years , then continue training for at least a year after ordination . The men cited similar reasons for seeking ordination . " I 've been closely involved with the church for a number of years , " said Carl F. Brown , the labor economist for Ford Motor Company . " Now I 'm just making the commitment more formal . " Several of the Detroit candidates indicated they would want to become priests should the celibacy vow no longer be required . The men emphasized that they did not view the diaconate as a " second rate " priesthood and would seek to develop in the unusual role . They indicated that they would wear clerical clothing only rarely and were not interested In being addressed as " the reverend mister . " Even some priests are " taking off their collar and using their first names , " noted Mr. .
