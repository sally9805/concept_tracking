WATERSHIP DOWN Directed and Written by Martin Rosen <P> Readers for whom Watership Down is a cult object will doubtless find the animated screen version of Richard Adams ' tale lacking in those metaphorical , humanistic overtones and undertones that made this novel about a warren of freedom-loving bunny rabbits a bestseller . The film treats the story as a straightforward adventure , full of , shall we say , harebreadth escapes and ear-chomping fights . But given the care with which the animation has been accomplished , the good flashes of wit in the script and the brisk pace of the direction , the result is a first-class family entertainment . That is to say , it is a rare movie that keeps kids on the edge of their chairs without inducing in their parents an overwhelming desire to escape theirs for a smoke in the lobby . <P> The story involves a shy visionary rabbit named Fiver whose precognition that real estate developers are about to wreck his warren leads sensible Hazel and tough old Bigwig to organize a group of dissidents and set out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the title . In time they are aided by a delightfully loony seagull ( whose wonderful vocal characterization is supplied by the late Zero Mostel ) , who acts as scout and air arm in the climactic struggle against the fascist warren of the evil General Woundwort . Along the way there are troubles with the dogs , cats and humans of a nearby farm , some semimystical encounters with the Black Rabbit ( death ) , not to mention such mundane problems as snares and hrududus ( rabbitese for motor vehicles ) . <P> The philosophy that sustains the creatures throughout is mildly liberal and humane ( somewhere between Bertrand Russell and Hubert Humphrey ) , and there are moments when one feels that perhaps the whole thing is just another cleverly put ecological tract . What sustains the viewer , however , besides the sound plotting , is the stylishness of the piece . Except for an unfortunate arty prologue with featureless backgrounds and stylized bunnies , Watership Down is made in the classic manner of the old , excellent Disney films . The background painting is rich and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploit its ability to create the illusion of three-dimensionality , rather like the great tracks through the forests of Snow White and Bambi . Disney 's craftsmen might have made better visual definitions of characters-it 's sometimes hard to tell one cottontail from another - but the vocal characterizations by such English worthies as Ralph Richardson , Harry Andrews and Denholm Elliott are never confusing . The English pastoral tradition , both in painting and hi literature , informs the movie in a subliminal way that is very attractive . It even makes the largest miscue , a dreadful pop song called Bright Eyes sung by Art Garfunkel , almost bearable . <P> Watership Down may not be the ideal rendering of a book in which a lot of people have a vested emotional interest , but it is a worthy addition to the classic tradition of screen animation . Like the great Disney pictures of the past , it is illuminated by a darkness and an energy that rescue it time and again from blandness and cuteness and give it those resonances that will reverberate in a child 's imagination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
