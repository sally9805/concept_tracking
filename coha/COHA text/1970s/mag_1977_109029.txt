The cashmere sweater crowd threw what must have been the second biggest party of the week , right there along the calendar-art shores of the Monterey Peninsula , and when calm finally settled on all the Titleists that were lost in the iceplant of the Bing Crosby National Pro-Am , the only unanswered question was : If Gerald Ford can get that much publicity by playing 36 holes of golf , how long will it take Jimmy Carter to start hitting wedge shots on the White House lawn ? // It was perhaps the most unusual week that professional golfers have ever spent at the Crosby . There were more people , more presidents , more low scores , more splendid weather , more traffic , more Secret Service men and more eyefilling glimpses of Carmel Bay than ever before . And all of it in the name of work . // At Pebble Beach , Cypress Point and Monterey Peninsula Country Club this hoopla produced what had to be the grandest " major championship " that did not have an Open , Masters or PGA attached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Watson , the Crosby might as well be listed as a major triumph , for it had all the importance , attention and drama . // What it had on Sunday was three guys battling down the stretch , making bogeys as if they were at Augusta or Merion or Oakland Hills . When Watson got to the last hole at Pebble Beach , his two closest pursuers , Tony Jacklin and Lee Elder , had already lost any real chance of catching him by making sixes at this most famous , and most photographed , of the world 's par-5s . Watson hit a very long , slightly dangerous drive down the left , or ocean , side of the 18th fairway . Then he hit a four-iron second shot that he would describe as " somewhat less than desirable . " It sailed into a bunker next to the sea wall . A little more to the left , and he would have been down below with the sea lions . // Although Watson was once noted for his last-round collapses , he seemed rid of that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all last year without a tour victory , and now here he was again  --  in trouble . // Not that much trouble , however . He had played such superb golf all week that even with the shaky finish he would destroy the tournament record held by Billy Casper . He blasted out of the sand and over the green , chipped long and missed the 15-foot putt . But what he had left was a one-inch stroke for victory . He still shot 71 for a total of 273 , four strokes lower than anyone  --  Nicklaus , Palmer , Miller  --  had ever done in all the Crosbys of the past . // " This is not a bad thing to happen to somebody who used to drive down here from Stanford and sneak on these courses before dawn , " said Watson . // The Crosby got under way Thursday with a very smart-looking leaderboard , which is how classy events are supposed to unfold . Hubert Green landed the first blows on Pebble Beach by tying the course record of 65 , seven under par . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an indication of how gentle the place was going to be . Watson had a 66 at Pebble that day , and , in all , 45 players broke par across the Peninsula . When Green went the other direction on Friday with a 76 at Cypress Point , which would be his undoing over the long haul , he had a simple explanation . " I lost my roller , " he said , meaning the putter. // Friday was the day of Victor Regalado , no stranger to the followers of the Pleasant Valley Classic , which he won back in 1974 . Regalado began with a 67 at Monterey and duplicated the score at Pebble with the aid of three chip-ins . Regalado is from Tijuana , and he said afterward , " Trevino 's not here , so I 'm just trying to be low Mexican . " A stroke back of him were Watson , Jacklin and Elder . // On Saturday , Watson took command with a 67 in the seclusion of Monterey , while the multitudes scurried after Jerry Ford at Pebble and ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like a revolutionary campsite . Watson was 13 under par then , one ahead of Jacklin and two ahead of Elder , and their sub-par totals had none other than Jack Nicklaus scratching his head . // " If I was seven under , like I am now , at almost any other Crosby I 've ever played in , I 'd be leading , " Jack said . // Nicklaus ' first appearance of the season was what he termed " adequate . " He finished 11th , eight strokes behind Watson . Actually , Jack seemed more interested in two other things last week . One was calling around to Tahoe and Vail and asking about snow as he searched for a place to go skiing , a new hobby that makes his business associates and contract holders shudder . The other was taking delivery on his new toy , a Cessna Citation , which is just like Arnold Palmer 's , except for the Golden Bear logo on it rather than Mark McCormack 's umbrella . // As for the golf , Nicklaus could at least say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glamour types , a trio of blonds who have been smearing the ink on Jack 's headlines . In this Crosby , Johnny Miller , Ben Crenshaw and Jerry Pate missed the cut . // So did Jerry Ford , who more than Watson , Nicklaus , Crosby or the dozens of rhinestone cowboys , was the man who brought out the crowds . There were so many people tromping around the Peninsula all week that you needed a walkie-talkie to find your way back to the Del Monte Lodge . No one knew the exact head count on Saturday , which produced perhaps the largest traffic jam in the history of the 17-Mile Drive . The tournament always draws huge crowds , especially when it is blessed with decent weather , because it offers a chance to observe Jack Lemmon or James Garner raking a bunker . But with the amateur from Washington , D.C. on the premises , and the sunshine beaming down on all the whales offshore , the crowds broke all attendance records . // Jack Tuthill , the PGA tournament director , who was driving what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a golf cart bearing not only Tuthill but also a Secret Service agent with an ominous green case , inside of which was a submachine gun  --  said Saturday 's gathering was the largest he had ever seen on a golf course in the 16 years he has been on the tour . And at one point Clyde Mangum , another PGA official , called to a colleague on his hand radio and said , " If everybody out here tries to go to the 18th hole with Ford , it 'll sink . " // The Crosby was only the first of the former President 's golfing appearances for 1977 . His presence is not likely to create as much attention in the future , but it seems that he is going to become one of the pro-am " regulars " like , let us say , Efrem Zimbalist Jr . In two weeks he will be playing four rounds in the Bob Hope Desert Classic . He then plans to take his 18 handicap to the pro-am events of both the Jackie Gleason Inverrary and the Tournament Players Championship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official host for the Colgate Hall of Fame Classic at Pinehurst . Thus , as someone said , it looks as if he may participate in more PGA tournaments than Nicklaus. // The pro-am team of Ford and Arnold Palmer had little chance to do well in the tournament . Because Ford was in Washington on other business Thursday , Palmer competed in the first round at Cypress Point , counting only his own score  --  a 74  --  in the team event . Palmer 's agent-lawyer-friend , McCormack , substituted for Ford in that round , but only for companionship . In the pro-am part of the Crosby , teams need to be several thousand strokes under par even to be noticed . Ford and his entourage arrived in one of the government 's two Air Force Ones late Thursday afternoon , and after moving into the guest house of his friend and host , Darius Keaton , he hit a few practice shots at Monterey before dark . Keaton lives in one of those modest cottages at Pebble ; the chimney of his home is , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 8th hole . // When Ford began the tournament at the 10th tee of Monterey on Friday morning the scene was one of predictable madness . Thousands were waiting to see what yesterday 's President looked like , or maybe what a Secret Service man looked like in a yellow Pebble Beach golf cap and a red Vail Golf Club jacket with a wire running out of his ear and a bulge in his breast pocket . // Everything Ford said , wore and did seemed to become a matter of urgency to the press , and this Crosby had attracted the largest group of golfing media ever , outside of a major championship . Bulletin : Gerald Ford on Friday was wearing gray pants , light blue shirt , navy sweater and a white Thunderbird cap . Bulletin : Gerald Ford was wearing white Etonic shoes . Bulletin : Gerald Ford 's golf bag was white , pro-sized , with the presidential seal on the front . Bulletin : Gerald Ford was hitting Arnold Palmer golf balls into the iceplant. // Before the leading celebrity in town struck his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the tee from Washington , D.C. , the former President of the United States , amateur Gerald Ford . " Bulletin : Gerald Ford 's first shot on the 155-yard par-3 10th hole at Monterey sliced into a cluster of the electorate . He made a double bogey and was on the way to a five-hour round of , by all sophisticated estimates , granting gimmes here and there , 97 . Bulletin : Palmer usually addressed Jerry as " pardner . " Bulletin : the highlight of his tournament came when he holed a chip at the 14th at Pebble for a birdie. // Throughout his two rounds Ford constantly waved at crowds and turned around and smiled for the hordes of amateur picture takers . He not only upstaged the serious competition itself during his visit , but he also obscured that other newsworthy circumstance of the Crosby , the entry of those two attractive and bright young women amateurs , Nancy Lopez and Marianne Bretton . They were not the first females in the tournament  --  Babe Didrikson Zaharias had played in the old Crosby , back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event moved upstate from Rancho Sante Fe and grew into the biggest thing to hit Carmel Bay since leather patches on the elbows . // Inviting the girls had been the idea of Bing himself . He wanted the two best amateurs , and they would be Nancy Lopez , who had won the Western and several other trophies last year , and Donna Horton , who had taken the U.S. Women 's Amateur . When Horton turned pro , Bing took the runner-up , Bretton , 19 , UCLA sophomore , blonde , sweet and dynamite . For their $500 entry fee , the girls received everything that the men amateurs did  --  the same umbrellas , Scotch , equipment , shirts and sweaters . Men 's shirts and sweaters , as it happened , owing to an oversight. // The conversations of the girls were peppered with such things as , " There 's Tom Watson , oh , wow ! " They played practice rounds with Pate and Palmer and were thoroughly dazzled . When the tournament began , however , Marianne teamed with Bel-Air pro Eddie Merrins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Guadalajara , who used tees three inches high and carefully sculpted rounds of 82-75-84 . The girls did n't do badly , especially since they had to use the men 's tees . On Friday Lopez had a 73 , Bretton a 78 . Overall , Nancy helped her pro 26 shots , Marianne hers 27. // Summing it all up , practically in unison Nancy and Marianne said , " It 's just been one thrill after another . " // For an altogether different reason , Tom Watson no doubt would be the first person to agree .
