 |p468  A Canoe Helps Hawaii Recapture Her Past B LUMINOUS SPRAY outlined the double bows of Hokule'a as she raced through the darkness in gale-force winds toward the island of Hawaii . It was a stormy rehearsal at sea ? a real test for our Hawaiian crew , and for the sailing canoe itself . In 1976 we plan to take her in the manner of our ancestors on a 6,000-mile round trip to Tahiti . Chilling rainsqualls came out of the blackness to pelt us without warning . Gradually wavetops became visible under a brightening sky , and we could see another squall bearing down on us . Crewmen straining at ' their steering paddles , Hokule'a veered off the wind , to outrun it . Hokule'a picked up speed until she was surfing at 12 knots or more ; the 22-man crew broke into exultant cheers . That afternoon we neared Kailua-Kona , on the island of Hawaii . Without knowledge of our arrival , a thousand people had gathered to watch canoe races there . Among them was slight , gray-haired Iolani Luahine , regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some as handmaiden to the volcano goddess , Pele . " When I saw Hokule'a appear , paddles flashing as you came into the bay , I was spellbound , " she told  |p471  me later . " It looked like a ghost out of the past . Nobody on the bay made a sound . Then , when you blew the conch-shell trumpets , there ' was a shout from the people such as I have never heard ! " Hokule'a is much more than just a sporting craft . She is also a floating classroom on which , already , more than a hundred Hawaiian Islanders have learned to sail as their forebears did . And in our voyaging between the Hawaiian and Society Islands , she will serve as a laboratory for a range of scientific tests . That trip will also help settle an old question : Did the early Polynesians make extended round-trip voyages between Pacific islands , as our legends relate ? To us Hawaiians , though , the canoe is something even more . She is a beautiful , dramatic reminder of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day we sailed to Honaunau Bay ( see " Close-Up : U.S.A. " ? Hawaii , a supplement to this issue ) . There racing canoes guided us to a safe anchorage , then ferried us ashore to a waiting feast . Off the beach at the City of Refuge National Historical Park , an ancient sanctuary , Hokule'a floated in water so clear that her twin hulls seemed to be hanging in midair . In the days that followed , the people came : from Honaunau , Milolii , Volcano , and Hilo ; whole families from Kona , Ka'u , and Kohala . Some were delighted to come aboard , others too shy . " We just want to look at the canoe , " many said . Some sat all day on the rocks at water 's edge , until it was too dark to see . For this was the " spaceship " of their ancestors . Such vessels , designed by men who had no knowledge of metals and who navigated without instruments , had made voyages that , in the context of their time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to archeological evidence , the first canoes from the South Pacific arrived in the Hawaiian Islands more than 1,200 years ago. * Our planned round-trip voyage from Hawaii to Tahiti and Raiatea ( map , page 477 ) will commemorate a later time when venturers from the Society Islands began a new era of exploration . They discovered islands , and dominated those  |p475  that had already been settled by earlier Polynesian discoverers . Such a man was the high priest Pa'ao , who sailed from Raiatea to the islands of Hawaii thirty generations ago . According to our legends , he found that the islands lacked strong rulers . He sailed home again , and returned with the high chief Pili , who founded the dynasty of which our greatest king , Kamehameha I , was a member . Another legend tells of Mo'ikeha , who voyaged from my home valley of Waipio , on the island of Hawaii , to " Tahiti of the Golden Haze . " With his navigator , Kama-hua-lele , * Mo'ikeha returned to Hawaii to wed the daughter of the ruling chief of Kauai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his grandson . When European deepwater exploration was still in its infancy , Polynesians had explored a huge triangle of the earth 's surface , with Hawaii , Easter Island , and New Zealand as its outer limits . Eventually , however , the impact of Western technology , with its metals and its gunpowder , dealt a fatal blow to Polynesian self-esteem , which led to the disintegration of Polynesian culture . Still , today 's descendants of those early mariners can take heart from the courage and inventiveness with which their forebears survived in an appallingly meager environment , and progressed beyond mere survival to develop a life-style of amazing richness . Project Could Reawaken Cultural Pride That was the drift of a chat I had in 1973 with Dr. Ben R. Finney , Professor of Anthropology at the University of Hawaii and Research Associate at the East-West Center . Ben agreed that some celebration of ancient Polynesian achievements might hearten Pacific islanders , strengthen their pride in a rich heritage , and enable them to endure the relentless external pressures and to make their own choices between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bernice P. Bishop Museum 's senior anthropologist , pointed out that native Hawaiians ' lack of confidence in their culture results in the abandonment of features that have played a significant role in island life . And when an important object , such as the voyaging canoe , is forgotten , all useful culture associated with it disappears too . The voyaging canoe ! It lay at the very heart of Polynesian culture . Without it , there would be no Polynesia . As an artist , a sailor , and an amateur anthropologist , I had come to regard it as the finest artifact that the Polynesians had produced . The canoes probably exerted a " shaping " influence on their makers . When a chief began a voyage of exploration to find new land for his people , he would choose as companions men with powerful muscles , stamina , and ample fat to sustain them in @# 475  |p476  times of hunger , and to insulate them against the energy-sapping and eventually deadly exposure to wind and spray . He would bring women who seemed capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed on an uninhabited island , it would become the ancestor pool for future generations . To me it seems no genetic accident that Polynesians , as a race , are large and powerful people . Successful Voyage Depends on Research I felt that if a voyaging canoe were built and sailed today , it would function as a cultural catalyst and inspire the revival of almost-forgotten aspects of Hawaiian life . I learned quickly that other Hawaiians believed in that idea . Mrs. Paige Kawelo Barber of the Congress of Hawaiian People , Fred Cachola , Jr. , of the Kamehameha Schools , and psychiatrist Dr. Ben Young of the University of Hawaii were among many who shared my enthusiasm for the project . There was much to be done . The canoe would have to be built to ancient design . Launching it would require the revival of old ceremonies . There would be training in early Polynesian seamanship , navigation , astronomy , and craft skills . Long-forgotten foodpreservation techniques would have to be studied . We 'd need to know much more about the old Hawaiian ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our ancestors carried plants and animals with them and caught fish during voyages . Tommy Holmes , an outstanding waterman , shared my interest in building a copy of the voyaging canoe and making an experimental voyage to Tahiti . " You 've been reading my mind ! " he exclaimed . " I 've been thinking of that idea for years . " More support came from Kenneth Emory , whose investigations over the past half century laid the foundation for our experiment , and Ben Finney , who had already built a 40-foot re-creation of a classic Hawaiian double canoe . Ben 's experiments showed that such craft , under sail , could make voyages between Hawaii and Tahiti , though probably no canoe could carry enough food and water for paddlers over that long distance . Dr. David Lewis , in Honolulu to work with me on another project , was a leading expert in noninstrument navigation techniques. * Though he was still recuperating from the ordeal of a single-handed voyage through Antarctic waters , he joined us with alacrity . Other prominent men and women also contributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with offices at the Bishop Museum . Meanwhile . our project had been accepted as a Hawaiian event of the U. S. Bicentennial celebration . Our canoe would be named Hokule'a ? " Star of Gladness , " in Hawaiian . It is the name for Arcturus , the zenith star of Hawaii . the " Big Island . " The star would lead the canoe home on her return voyage . As she took form on the drawing board , I made sure that her appearance would be faithful to the old canoes , whose lines had been well documented by early European visitors . Hull shape and sail plan were true to ancient eastern Polynesian designs , and parts would be secured with rope lashings . Canvas sails would serve for training voyages , but on the trip to Tahiti , sails of plaited pandanus leaves would be used . Modern materials went into our canoe ? but only where they would not affect sailing performance . In earlier times the trunks of two great trees would have been painstakingly shaped with hand tools to form the underbodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ; instead , our shipwrights planked up frames with plywood and covered the hulls with fiberglass . Sacred Site Picked for Launching We built her at Dillingham Shipyard in Honolulu , then trucked the completed parts across Oahu to the beach at Kualoa ? a place once so sacred that canoes lowered their sails as they passed . Volunteers came to lash her together with five miles of rope . Finally ? nine months after her design began ? she was ready to take to the water . On March 8 , 1975 , the beach at Kualoa rang with chants and ceremonies dating from Hawaii 's earliest years . The chanter Ka'upena Wong officiated that day , as Hokule'a at last took to her element . A thousand spectators watched men take hold of hauling lines . Paddlers stationed @#  | themselves at the cross booms connecting the two hulls . Ka'upena began the traditional launching shout , and the canoe moved forward . Her bows came down over the crest of the beach , and with a thunderous rumble Hokule'a plunged into Kaneohe Bay . For two months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her personality revealed itself . She did not seem to like the reef-studded bay . But when she headed for open water , she took surf and channel swells eagerly . New Mariners Try Old-time Diet Paige Barber ( page 479 ) had organized a great feast for that launching ceremony . Now she headed the massive effort of provisioning a crew of 18 for their month-long Tahiti voyage plus their three-week stint on a training diet . Fish , taro , breadfruit , bananas , sweet potatoes , yams , coconuts , octopus , medicinal herbs , and the specially flavored Hawaiian red salt all would be needed to give the crew a varied diet . Acquiring enough taro root ? once the staple of Hawaii ? was a problem ; with changing tastes and rising costs , its popularity even among tradition-minded Hawaiians has waned . First boiled , then pounded into a heavy paste , taro becomes hard poi , and that too is a voyaging food ; its slowly fermenting sugar acts as a preservative . Our taro search focused new interest on the traditional plant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It shows that the native farmer has much to offer the world . This may restore pride and dignity to an art of farming that is passing into antiquity . " Dried bananas came from the Cook Islands . They are still produced there , as a candy , but once they must have been an important high-energy food for voyagers . From Kona we received information on ancient techniques used to dry fish . But where , we wondered , could we obtain the great quantities of fish we would need to dry for the voyage ? Contestants at the Hawaiian International Billfish Tournament at Kona answered by donating more than two tons of marlin and tuna . Each night , after the fishing boats docked , Mauna Roy worked long hours cleaning the big fish . The 3,700 pounds of fillets were wrapped and frozen . Before the long voyage , Mauna and other volunteers will take  |p480  the fish out to the hot , dry lava desert north of Kailua-Kona and dry them in the sun . Wherever Hokule'a landed , Paige Kawelo Barber and her ladies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The drying boxes were flat racks , three by eight feet , screened on top and bottom , with a heavier screen inside to hold the food . Almost all of our fruits and vegetables were dried in these boxes , which generated considerable interest . " With the high cost of electricity , " a Kona fisherman commented , " I 'm going to dry my surplus fish now instead of freezing them . " Another onlooker mentioned that a lot of homegrown bananas on Hawaii went to waste , because they all ripened at once . " If people dried those bananas , " he suggested , " they 'd save money on their grocery bills . " Paige nodded . " Yes , and children eat them like candy , they enjoy them so much . " Trainees Vie for the Big Voyage Men of Oahu sailed the canoe on her maiden voyage to Maui . By unspoken agreement , crewmen often wore malo ( loincloths ) . Even photographer David Hiser donned one , earning many a remark about his okole kea ? his pallid posterior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maui crew sailed her to the island of Hawaii . Crews from Hawaii , Molokai , Oahu , and Kauai would participate in other training voyages . Finally , the crew selection would be made for the long voyage to Tahiti and Raiatea and back . Like the ancient voyagers , we will carry breadfruit and other plants to be transplanted on Tahiti and Raiatea . There will be animals too . The Honolulu Zoo , which has been conducting a breeding experiment to produce modern equivalents of the barkless , vegetarian dogs that early Polynesians raised for food , has offered to share the results ; one such dog , named Hoku , will accompany us . Physiologists , psychologists , physici navigation experts ? people in each of th specialties will be checking our crew me hers before and after the trip . They want learn how well we withstand the rigors long weeks at sea , and how well we fare the ancient foods . And , of course , how precisely we find our way , without the help sextant , compass , chronometer , or chart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than crewtraining voyages ; they were shakedown cruises for Hokule'a . What we learned in the rough channel waters would guide us in refitting the canoe for the long trip . In bright moonlight , six-foot swells , ala steady breeze , we left Hawaii bound i Maui . At sunrise we turned downwind to ft the rough water along Maui 's southern coat ( below ) . The wind picked up and we surfed in 12-foot seas , reaching speeds of more than 15 knots . It was an exhilarating sensation , and we relaxed our guard for a moment . Suddenly @# 481 a powerful wave lifted the stern , and swung Hokule'a off course . The wind got behind us , slamming the aftersail around in an uncontrolled jibe . Both gaff and boom snapped . Kimo Hugho , a Honolulu fireman and expert in racing canoes , looked up from the port steersman 's cockpit to view the damage .. At that moment , a wave tore the nine-foot steering paddle from his hands . The shaft clubbed him on the side of the head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 'll take the sail , " I shouted to crew instructor Buffalo Keaulana . But " Buff " was already in motion . He wrapped his powerful arms around Kimo and dragged him to the safety of the deck . Meanwhile we struggled to get Hokule'a back on course . Kimo revived quickly and washed the blood from his face . We were relieved to see that his eyes were clear and focused well . We unfurled the aftermast 's storm sail and , in strong offshore gusts of gale force , we slogged upwind off Maui . Two hours later the canoe reached the calm waters of Lahaina , and another feast of welcome . Yes , Hokule'a was our floating classroom , and we were learning our lessons . It became clear , for example , that the traditional manu ? the upswept ends of the hulls ? were more than mere ornamentation . While running downwind , the surfing canoe would speed down the face of a swell , into the trough ahead . Those bow pieces would strike the back of the next swell in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hulls to glide upward . Another lesson was this : On a vessel that does not depend on metal parts , almost anything that breaks can be seized with splints and cord . Covert Gifts Honor Canoe Crew Few secrets are safe from the " coconut wireless " in the islands . I still do n't know how the people of Molokai learned we were coming , but they were waiting with a feast . All during Hokule'a 's stay there , boxes of food would appear on the pier nearby . " People just put them there and leave , " Kimo told me  |p484  when I arrived from Oahu for a weekend of training . " The people here are so generous that it 's difficult for us to buy anything on this island . " There were other compliments , and some complaints . But nowhere did we encounter the behavior that in Polynesia can express disapproval : studied indifference . Hokule'a Inspires More Boatbuilding When news of Hokule'a spread , it created interest in building other double-hulled sailing canoes . On Maui , the 42-foot Mo'olele , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( preceding pages ) , and other canoes are being planned on Kauai , Hawaii , and Oahu . The Tahitians are interested , too . It is possible that they will complete construction of a long-distance voyaging canoe in time to sail in company with us on our scheduled return to Hawaii from Tahiti this summer Fiji Islanders are talking of intervillare sailing-canoe races . Plans are also in the works there to build a copy of the swift double-hulled ndrua , which aroused the fervent admiration of early European visitors By the time our Tahiti voyage takes place . Hokule'a will have become even more authentic . Thousands of feet of braided sennit , or coconut-fiber rope , from the Tuvalu ( Ellice ) Islands and the Tuamotus will replace some of the nylon rope that we now use . Pandanus sail matting has come from the Gilbert Islands and the tiny Polynesian atoll of Kapingamarangi . Two elderly women on the little atoll still knew the old technique of plaiting sails . They recruited younger women and taught them the craft . Unfortunately our agent forgot to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oversupply of genuine  |p485  sail matting on Kapingamarangi , available to museums and to collectors . One of our last interisland training voyages involved a cruise to the island of Kauai and back to Oahu . The trip to Kauai was one of the most idyllic sails we had experienced . We knew , though , that the ' return to Oahu would be most difficult : some 300 miles of long , pounding tacks against powerful winds and currents . But it was more than difficult it was almost disastrous . Oversight Threatens Tragedy The problem began , ironically , because of a " safety feature " ? a mounting frame that had been added for an emergency outboard motor . The mount deflected wavetops over the stern of the starboard hull ; it also caused seepage through the hull 's storm cover . During the second night of the voyage , the hull was bailed twice , then we relaxed our vigilance . I was awakened at sunrise for consultation about a course change , and noticed that the starboard hull was riding dangerously low in the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too late . Several large waves poured in around the bailers , and the hull swamped . Hokule'a tilted at a sharp angle , broadside to the waves . We cut away sails , spars , and the deck shelter , then lashed them all to windward of the floating port hull to help prevent capsizing . The radio was inoperative , but except for the lurking presence of a large shark , there was now little danger . We were not far off Kauai , in a current that would carry us , along its south shore . Fighting tears of disappointment , a crew member began a 485  |p489  traditional Hawaiian song . All aboard joined in the solemn yet optimistic chorus as we saw the jet-powered hydrofoil Kalakaua approaching on her morning run to Kauai ( page 487 ) . A few hours later a Coast Guard boat took us in tow . Ever since Hokule'a 's 800-year-old design first appeared on my drawing board , I had wondered how well she would hold together in heavy seas . Now she had survived stresses that might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lashings enabled her to withstand the battering of eightfoot waves and the strain of being towed . " A most fortunate accident , " wrote David Lewis , soon to arrive to begin our training program in noninstrument navigation . And he was right . With the knowledge we gained from the mishap , we could refit the canoe and retest her for the long voyage to the South Pacific . Many messages poured in after the swamping , some accompanied by donations . One caller , an elderly Hawaiian lady , expressed the feelings of many : " When I heard on the radio that Hokule'a was in trouble , I felt as though one of my own family were in danger . " Supreme Test Yet Uncompleted Already Hokule'a has logged many weeks at sea , and voyaged some 1,500 miles . By the time you read these words , we hope to be en route to Tahiti , following one of the longest and most difficult of the early Polynesian sea routes . Unlike the ancients , who preferred to travel in company with other canoes , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be tracking us by radio . When we reach our South Pacific goal , we can compare our position estimates with its charts , to see how accurate our navigation has been , using the ancient ways . What effect has the voyaging canoe Hokule'a had on the islands where she was born ? Because of her , the Polynesian Voyaging Society was formed ? a nonprofit organization that will continue to enrich the teaching of Hawaii 's past . And , because of her , there are more double canoes a-building , or already sailing Pacific waters . The food-preservation project that made it possible for us to provision Hokule'a has brought in many inquiries about the old foods ? so many , in fact , that we have had to print up recipes . We who sail Hokule'a are meeting the same challenges that those early mariners faced , and we have developed a strong feeling of kinship with them . And when our voyage is over , I hope we will have properly commemorated the achievements of our ancestors for all Polynesians.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
