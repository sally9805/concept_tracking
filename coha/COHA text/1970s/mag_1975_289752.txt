CONTINENTS IN MOTION : THE NEW EARTH DEBATE by WALTER SULLIVAN <P> 397 pages . Illustrated . McGraw-Hill. $17.95 . <P> During World War I , while a young German officer lay in a hospital recuperating from his wounds , he passed the time looking at maps and pondering the remarkable way in which the opposing sides of the Atlantic seemed to fit together . Alfred Wegener was not the first to notice that the bulging coastline of Brazil is a reciprocal of the west coast of Africa . For centuries scientists and cartographers speculated that a single large continent , which came to be called Pangea , had broken up into huge fragments that floated like rafts on the earth 's plastic core until they reached their present positions . Such theories , however , were consistently hooted down with the derision scientists so often reserve for new ideas . Wegener , who had already established a reputation as a polar explorer and meteorologist , was undaunted . After his recovery , he devoted his life to proving the theory of continental drift . In 1930 Wegener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other men were able to carry on where he left off . Today , with slight variations , the idea that the earth is a fragile and constantly changing planet is generally accepted by most geologists . <P> Books dealing with the formation of the earth usually move only slightly faster than the glaciers that helped landscape the surface of the planet ( about 20 miles a millennium ) . Continents in Motion is a striking exception . Walter Sullivan , science editor of the New York Times , concentrates as much on people and events as upon geological epochs . The result is a book nearly as entertaining as a good detective story-and considerably more informative . <P> Sullivan builds his case for continental drift carefully , treating skeptics as fairly as he does supporters of this once controversial concept . He is clearly no believer in Immanuel Velikovsky , whose theory that cataclysmic planetary events reshaped the earth during biblical times was first scorned and then suppressed by the scientific establishment . Sullivan acknowledges modern geologists ' debt to Velikovsky for forcing them to re-examine old assumptions about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late Maurice Ewing , who founded Columbia University 's Lamont Geological Observatory and provided the theoretical basis for things like submarine geology and attempts to study the underwater mountain range that bisects the Atlantic . Nor does he slight the host of others who have mapped the ocean bottoms , peered into smoking volcanoes or attempted to drill through the earth 's crust to the semimolten mantle that surrounds its liquid core . Along the way , Sullivan scatters suggestive pieces of evidence with a skill that would do credit to Agatha Christie . He points out that the ancestors of certain North American animals seem to have come to their new home from Asia , something they could not have done if an ocean barred their way . He reports that the sea floor is spreading constantly on both sides of undersea ridges , notes that the Himalayas are growing at the rate of a few inches a century , forced upward as the Indian subcontinent pushes itself against the Asian mainland .                 @ @ @ @
