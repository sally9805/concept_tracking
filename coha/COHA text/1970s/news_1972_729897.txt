txt Dr. Daniel Ellsberg stands a much greater chance of being convicted and sent to prison for leaking the Pentagon papers to the American press as a result of the 12 new indictments issued against him Dec. 30 . This opinion is the conclusion of law professors from five leading universities in the United States questioned by this newspaper about the recently expanded charges against the Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher . A similar informal survey last July showed that the government case against Dr. Ellsberg was very weak because of several highly disputable points in the original charges . Conviction could now mean up to 115 years in jail terms and $120,000 in fines . The original charges could have brought 10 years in prison and $50,000 in fines . The outlook for Dr. Ellsberg 's trial changed dramatically when the two original counts against him  --  theft of government property and intentionally endangering national security ? were recast , and expanded by 10 new charges , including conspiracy , The same Los Angeles grand jury that first indicted him last July handed down the new charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The most dramatic change in the case , the legal scholars agree , is likely to be the effect of the new conspiracy charge , which also brings in Dr. Ellsberg 's friend and Rand Corporation colleague Anthony J. Russo Jr . The conspiracy charge , besides carrying a heavier sentence , generally eases the burden of government proof , the lawyers explained . If the prosecution can adequately establish that the two defendants plotted to perform illegal acts , it need not prove every act it alleges the two committed . The other new charges against Dr. Ells-berg , a former Department of Defense analyst , include not just the original count of stealing government property , but concealing , unauthorized conveyance , and receiving stolen government property vital to the national defense . Besides conspiracy , Mr. Russo was charged by the Los - Angeles grand jury with three counts of receiving and unauthorized possession of ? stolerr-government  --  propertyvital to the national defense . Previously he was not charged at all . These are not considered by legal analysts to be more serious charges than the original indictment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scho* comments " It sbunds as if the government is covering itself by alleging illegal acts at different stages to assure a conviction on at least one count , " one noted legal scholar commented . In analyzing the case , lawyers , both constitutional and criminal , also cited some of the possible arguments and difficulties to be encountered by both the defense and prosecution when the trial starts in Los Angeles . It is tentatively scheduled to begin March 7 , although a delay is expected . Generally , they say the prosecution 's case will be fairly straightforward : factually to prove that Dr. Ellsberg schemed , then reproduced  --  thereby stealing  --  the papers and later turned the copies over to the press . To prove Mr. Russo guilty , it will be necessary to show that he schemed , received , and had unauthorized control over the papers . The Los Angeles grand jury also named but did not charge two co-conspirators : Miss Lindy Sinay , a Los Angeles businesswoman , and Vu Van Thai , a former South Vietnamese ambassador who later became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written . All three are friends of Dr. Ellsberg . ) Prosecution problems ? There are , however , two areas that may present problems for the prosecution . To win its case , it is essential that the prosecution sufficiently prove : ? The degree of complicity , if any , between Dr. Ellsberg and Mr. Russo . Proving to what extent Mr. Russo was involved in planning the actual use of the papers may be difficult . If , for example , his role as an accomplice in the planning stage can not be proven , he then may take on the legal status of Miss Sinay , who admitted she helped reproduce the papers but had no knowledge of the documents ' future use , This may be facilitated by the fact that Mr. Russo was not charged with stealing the papers , only receiving them . ? The specific intent of the participants . The espionage and conspiracy charges against the two men require proof that the alleged offenders intended or had " reason to believe " that the documents could be used " to the injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign nation . " In the first place , Dr. Ellsberg has contended from the beginning that his actions have been to help rather than hurt the United States . Secondly , actually defining some of these words , technically and in terms of legal precedent , such as " injury , " " national security , " " national defense , " and " advan- tage to a foreign nation " may be the prosecution 's toughest job . As one lawyer explained , " It 's not simply a matter of what the government can rule illegal , but what it has already prohibited . " Interpretative note On the other hand , the legal scholars expect the defense case to be intricately interpretative rather than dependent on fact . Dr. Ellsberg has at several points announced that he hopes to make the trial into a major hearing on issues as varied as the legality Ortli-e-vv ar-and-govern m ent-secrecyingen eral . Experts point to two arguments important to the defense : ? One , if not the major point of debate , will be that the whole classification operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top secret-sensitive . " The defense will probably bring in experts , such as the Pentagon staffer who testified before Cngress that 991/2 percent of what is classified " secret " need not be . An extension of this argument will be the testimony of journalists and other government officials who have openly had access to secret materials despite their classification . ? The main obstacle to the defense , the outside lawyers contend , will be the conspiracy charge  --  not just the seriousness of the charge , but its implications and the government 's probable technique of proof . Psychological effect ' " The joint implication ca n't help but suggest guilt , " one noted legal scholar admitted . " It will definitely have a psychological effect on both the public and the jury . " In bringing forth evidence in conspiracy , he said , " the government can bring forth information of doubtful relevancy because almost any statement or action from the past is admissible . This often can damage the defendant 's image without proving any conspiratorial deed , which benefits the prosecution 's case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indictments , there are several other points suggested by actions of both the government and Dr. Ellsberg 's lawyers which ? may offer further insight into what can be expected at the trial . The first question involves the indictment of Miss Sindy and Mr. Vu Van Thai , neither of whom was charged with -a crime . Former U.S. Sen. Charles E , Goodell , head of the Ellsberg Defense Fund and one of his lawyers , said , " It 's important to determine why those two were indicted but never formally charged . It 's hard to see the purpose of it . " The indictment of Vu Van Thai hints at more than the listing of Miss Sinay . The charges are that the former Vietnamese diplorriat , now a United Nations- consultant , received and possessed one volume of the papers . Volumes withheld The volume , which covers American strategy to end the war and obtain release of U.S. prisoners , is one of the four Dr. Ells-berg did not turn over to the press because of their sensitive content . Lawyers speculate that Vu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Dr. Ellsberg 's intent in releasing the papers was to the advantage of a foreign nation . This could be documented by listing any contacts that Vu Van Thai , who has advocated a negotiated settlement since 1967 , had with the North Vietnamese or the National Liberation Front . Vu Van Thai , it could then be implied , had the opportunity to pass on information from the secret papers to the enemy . On the other side , points of interest from the defense include the issues of trial site and charges of government " hassling " of the defense . Although the defense claims it now has no plans to request a change of venue from Los Angeles to Boston , it argued vehemently in favor of a Boston site during the pretrial hearings . This unexpected change of heart , according to defense lawyers , is attributed to the new defendant , Mr. Russo , who lives in Los Angeles and is said to be penniless , and also to the fact that the U.S. district judge there , Matthew Byrne Jr. , is already totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers familiar wan the case say these reasons do n't outweigh the three factors that favor a Boston trial . They are the lower cost of travel for de fense personnel ; the likelihood of a more sympathetic jury in Boston ; and the more liberal panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals here , which would hear the case if it were appealed . In California , the appeals judges are mostly Nixon appointees through Gov . Ronald Reagan and very conservative . The other issue of interest is the hint that the government might be purposely annoying the defenseThissuggestion was made both by Dr. Ellsberg 's lawyers arid-legal scholars consulted about the case . The most immediate example of this is the timing of the new indictments . Anticipated much earlier by those close to the case , thenewindictments came only six days before the pretrial hearing  --  scheduled last August  --  was to begin . As a result of the last-minute indictments , many of the defense motions and arguments were rendered moot . Both legal scholars and lawyers agreed that the new charges could just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indictments as six days before hearings , a rather inconvenient time for the defense to begin developing arguments . The legal hassle over Dr. Ellsberg 's confessed conveyance of the papers to the American press does not stop with the Los Angeles trial . A second grand jury has been meeting in Boston since last summer and is scheduled to resume its investigation on Jan. 18 , It has been delayed while a federal jtidge looked into charges made by two grand-jury witnesses that they had been illegally wiretapped . Because of the witnesses it has thus far called , the Boston grand jury is assumed to be looking into the publication and distribution of the Pentagon papers . Indictments may be forthcoming against newspapers and publishing houses as well as individual employees involved in obtaining the documents . The grand jury here may also add new indictments against Dr. Ellsberg . Former Senator Goodell acknowledged that if new charges are made against those who received the documents , it is probable that those who distributed them would also be Thus Dr. Ellsberg 's long legal journey , one that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sight .
