In addition to his powerful mechanical legs and zoom-lens artificial eye , television 's Six Million Dollar Man has an atomic-powered arm that can knock down walls , lift cars and pull out trees by the roots . Reid Hilton 's new arm is only slightly less remarkable-and considerably less expensive . Hilton , 24 , a Santa Ana , Calif. , karate expert who lost his right arm below the elbow in an accident , will probably not risk smashing bricks with his experimental $40,000 replacement . But the prosthesis should enable him , with practice , to function like a man with two natural arms , and in some ways outperform him . <P> Hilton 's 8-lb. myoelectric ( from the Greek myos , for muscle ) arm was developed at Northwestern University and modified by engineers and researchers at the medical-products division of General Atomic and at Rancho Los Amigos , a hospital associated with the University of Southern California . The arm , which can be fitted with either a hook or a normal-looking hand , does not look much different from other powered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most artificial arms use a system of receivers on the surface of the skin and microtransmitters under the skin to carry messages from the nerves to the arm 's controls , plus belt-carried batteries for power . Hilton 's arm needs neither . Its controls are directly connected to the nerves in the stump of his severed arm . The power pack is inside the prosthesis . Unlike most other artificial arms and hands , it is also equipped with feedback devices that give him a sense of touch . <P> Powerful Pinch . To attach the arm , Dr. Vert Mooney and his colleagues inserted three " buttons " or fasteners through the skin in the stump . ( The buttons can permanently protrude through the skin without promoting infection because they are coated with pyrolytic carbon , * which Mooney says forms an antibacterial seal . ) The doctors connected two of the buttons to the arm 's median and ulnar nerves with stainless-steel coils , and wired the third button to another carbon plug that serves as a ground . They then connected all buttons to wires in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . To operate the arm and its hand properly , Hilton moves his remaining arm muscles selectively ; their contractions produce electrical impulses that , transmitted to the prosthesis , open and close his hand . <P> Doctors believe it will be at least five years before arms like Hilton 's become generally available , and concede that further modifications may still have to be made in their prototype . They hope eventually to bring the cost of the device within reach of other amputees ( Hilton 's arm , without research and development expenses , would cost about $1,200 ) . Meanwhile , Hilton is demonstrating that the prosthesis is practical ; he is learning how to pick up small objects , open cigarette packages and tie his own shoes . He is also learning to be careful , especially when handling delicate objects . A normal male grip exerts a force of about 25 Ibs . Hilton 's electronically assisted grip strength is a formidable 40 Ibs . <P> <P> * An extremely hard and pure form produced by burning a derivative of carbon in a blend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
