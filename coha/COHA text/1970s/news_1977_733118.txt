txt LETTERS pg . 241 LETTERS The 50 's To the Editor : Hilton Kramer 's vituperative response to my book " Gates of Eden " ( April 10 ) was predictable , but I was genuinely surprised at the degree of misrepresentation to which he was reduced . I 'd like to set the record straight on a few of the more blatant distortions : 1 . Since my book is primarily about the 1960 's rather than the 50 's , it 's not hard for Kramer to scour the index and find figures of the 50 's whose work I do n't discuss , figures like . . . Adolf Hitler , for example . Yet a number of writers he thinks neglected  --  Roethke , Lowell , Baldwin ( in his essays ) , Ellison  --  are not only mentioned but highly praised , though not always for reasons Kramer would share . For Kramer this is the equivalent of a sneak attack . ( Even the name whose absence rankles Kramer most ? Hannah Arendt ? turns out to be missing only from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Eichmann case , a discrepancy regrettable to me but , alas , quite fatal for a close reader like Kramer . ) In any case the severest criticism of the 50 's came from the writers of the 50 's themselves : In Lowell 's description of the " tranquilized " 50 's , in numerous critiques of " the silent generation , " in Riesman 's " The Lonely Crowd , " in Whyte 's " The Organization Man , " in Chase 's " The Democratic Vista , " in Mailer 's " The White Negro , " in Podhoretz 's " The Young Generation , " in Irving Howe 's " This Age of Conformity , " and so on . Kramer 's celebration of the period must leave out a good deal that distressed not merely the 60 's but some of the best minds of the earlier decade . 2 . I was particularly surprised to learn that my book . reviles two of the writers of the 50 's whose work I most admire , Bernard Malamud and Lionel Trilling . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Malamud was doing his best writing , I relished his voice and his world beyond those of any other living novelist . I tried to convey this affection , along with my growing sense of his limitations , in a long article on the front page of this Book Review ( Oct. 3 , 1971 ) , and again in my more compressed discussion in " Gates of Eden . " In the book I write : " Nowhere do we see the revised version of the Jewish psyche more clearly expressed , more poignantly imagined , than in Malamud 's work . " Kramer skips over this sentence , while quoting what precedes and follows it , just as he ignores half a dozen other laudatory characterizations from the same paragraph , which give Malamud 's work a central place in the fiction of the 50 's . By selective quotation , or lack of quotation , Kramer strains for the impression that my account of Malamud " is actually a political ambush . " Let the objective reader decide for himself whether Kramer 's version bears any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonished to learn of my " summary indictment " of Lionel . Trilling . Fortunately , a good many reviews have already described what they take to be a complex and serious treatment of his work as a critic . . . . Trilling was a teacher of mine , and later a colleague at Col-mbia , and though my concerns in the book differ from his I 'd like to think that the balance and shading I 've always sought in criticism are closer to the spirit of his work than Kramer 's polemical furies and his zeal for caricature . Here again Kramer 's method of quotation is significant . He selects one of the few phrases that can be construed as critical in a - five- page discussion . Since the criticism is mild , however , the " summary indictment " seems rather weak ? except that the " summary indictment " is Kramer 's own invention , and purely a rhetorical device . 4 . Since Kramer does not find Hitler 's name in the index , he asserts that I ignore the impact of the Nazi genocide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Malamud I mention the Holocaust and the death camps four times , none of them indexed under Hitler . Example : " In the wake of the Holocaust the fate of the Jew , to many , had become a parable of the human condition : a drama of pointless , horrendous suffering that revealed the modern dimensions of terror and evil . . . " But since Kramer finds no listing for Hitler he decrees that I neglect the Holocaust . While claiming to admire critics like Trilling and praising " the standards of intellectual seriousness that obtained in the 50 's , " Kramer makes a mockery of the ethics of intellectual debate . . . . 5 . As for Kramer 's implication , only an implication mind you , that I do n't discuss Arendt 's " The Origins of Totalitarianism " because my own politics are somehow totalitarian , this sort of innuendo is truly worthy of the worst side of the period he so fervently eulogizes . ( I was further reminded of that wit from Wisconsin , who loved to bait eggheads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor , " a subtle touch. ) 6 . I 'm also surprised to learn that I " abominate " Philip Rahv ( a typical Kramerism ) . I consider Rahv one of the three or four best critics among the New York intellectuals of his generation . He had a powerful and impressive mind . My only reference to him in the book comes when I quote at length from a brilliant essay he wrote in the 1940 's , and use it as a keystone for my critique of some recent experimental fiction . The context is overwhelmingly complimentary to Rahv , though I also criticize his later incarnation as the scourge of all cultural innovation , a role that has now descended to Hilton Kramer . Unlike Rahv , Kramer ca n't understand that one can both admire and criticize the same writer , just as be considers it unthinkable for the editor of Partisan Review to publish the poets of the 50 's and also to publish criticism of that poetry . This is the kind of monolithic mind that accuses me of writing political polemic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever saw one . MORRIS DICKSTEIN New York City Mr. Kramer replies : With a friend and follower like Morris Dickstein , who needs enemies ? Privileges To the Editor . Allow me to protest the reference made to me in the interview by Joseph Lelyveld of Rosalie Witke ( April 3 ) . Miss Wince mentions having requested in China " the same privileges as Han Suyin " and proceeds to call me Mao 's " Hagiographer . " She hints that she declined to do what I did ; actually , the facts are exactly opposite to her version . I was granted two long visits with Chiang Ch'ing in 1969 and 1971 . She broadly hinted to me that she would like me to write her story ; this I declined bluntly to do , - and as a result Chiang Ch'ing disliked me intensely and accused me of being " an American spy . " Fortunately Premier Chou En-lai simply ignored the accusations , and I went on visiting my family in China . My son-in-law , Mr. Sidney Glazier , an American film producer , brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanked nor could he get any " privileges . " Apart from seeing Premier Chou Enlai and his wife , for whom I conceived a profound respect , I never asked for any " privileges " and never got any . Chiang Ch'ing found Miss Witke to do for her what I had refused to do . In 1973 Miss Witke came to see me in New York and entertained me for about two hours with her glowing accounts of Chiang Ch'ine 's importance , charm and intelligence . At the end I said to her : " May I give you a piece of advice ? The Chinese people do not like the lady . " Far from being a " hagiographer , " I have never written down interviews from officials ; not even from Premier Chou En-lai . Every time I have painstakingly checked all that was said to me against Chinese ordinary public opinion ; for I happen to know hundreds of ordinary people in China . They have been my friends over the decades , since I went to school and university in China . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe all that I am told , as Miss Witke seems to do . My two meetings with Chiang Ch'ing convinced me that she was , indeed , a paranoiac , and vastly untruthful , since she gave me two versions of her life ; Ness Witke 's , which I am reading now , is the third . Needless to say , it contains a good many inaccuracies . I shall only point to one : Chiang Ch'ing tells of being arrested by the Kuomintang and " swallowing " her Party identification document . This is pure invention . No Party card or Party identification document was ever issued until after 1949 ; for it was too dangerous fo anyone to be thus identified . I have checked this with about 50 Party members . I hope that people who read Miss Witke 's book will treat is as entertainment , which it is . But it is neither history , nor relevant to the Chinese revolution , nor to the Chinese people . Hex &mix; Paris Cordelia ' To the Editor . The review of Herbert Gold 's new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 ) reviews previous reviews of Herbert Gold and his works but says nothing about the story and theme of Mr. Gold 's current novel . It is not for the publisher to speak for the author . I am , therefore , submitting Mr. Gold 's own words about " Waiting for Cordelia " for your readers ' consideration : " I was looking for a way to treat San Francisco in a novel , and the relation of hookerdom to good citizenry seemed to raise most of the pertinent questions  --  love , money , class . Lust brings out not just the worst but also the best in both men and women . Lust leads to desire , desire leads to love , love leads to all sorts of interesting troubles and pleasures . " I started out to write simply a story about hookers and their clients , but found that through the protagonist  --  a monstrous , funny , intelligent world-wise madam ? I was also able to deal with my own strong feelings about love and society in the 1970 's . " DONALD I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
