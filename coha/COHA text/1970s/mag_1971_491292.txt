// On the other side of the coin of laughter is the imprint of tragedy . Together they make up the comedy of living . Because humor is simply the serious stuff of everyday life turned upside down . When you spend a few hours with Ted Key , a man who perhaps has sold more cartoons than anyone who ever tried , you begin to understand the gravity of pure laughter . The creator of " Hazel , " the beloved imp of her own cartoon series , of her own books , of her own TV shows and motion pictures , is living proof that the creation of laughter may well be the most serious business in the world . Psychiatrists assure us that laughter is a basic impulse connected with a personal feeling of survival . The pompous man in the top hat slips on a banana peel , and we all laugh . How are the mighty fallen ! And how , as we see them go down , are we subconsciously uplifted in our own estate . So ? a question ? what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What has that got to do with survival ? Aha , says the psychiatrist ? a lot . Experiments indicate that the most effective tickler ( better than a feather ) is a tooth-shaped instrument . Your laughter is an atavistic hangover from prehistoric days , a sound of relief dating back to the caveman as he made his escape from the lunge of a saber-toothed tiger or the crunch of a tyrannosaurus . Well , maybe . In fact , probably. * So what has all this got to do with Ted Key ? Oddly enough , practically everything . Because the hidden truth behind the work of this most sparkling of cartoonists , this witness to the follies and foibles of the world in which he lives , is his humanity . Compassion is the Key to Ted . Ted Key talks like a poet ? which he is in part . He also talks like a priest ? which he is in part . And he also talks like a boy ? which happily he is in spirit . Add all this up and you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one more thing must be added . Consider that the famous stand-up comics of our nightclubs and TV all have teams of writers working out their joke routines for them . The comic must know where the best boffs are in the script . And he must have a sense of timing and a verbal delivery which communicates a sense of *This brings up the fact that a smile is also a relic of the days when men reacted to intruders the way animals still do ? by displaying a set of biting teeth in fine working order as a warning to keep at a distance . Dentists please copy.laughter . But comics are usually not funny men in their own right . ( Groucho Marx is a notable exception . An unforgettable memory of Groucho is a moment in a Hollywood restaurant when he joined three men sitting together glumly at a table , not exchanging a word . After Groucho sat down with them , suddenly the laughter coming from that table filled the room . Yet those three men were at that time the top comedians in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else 's humor . In Groucho they met an original ; their laughter was a tribute to the master . ) But even Groucho must have his theater or his TV studio or his motion picture camera to put over the laugh . The cartoonist may share the Marxian eye for the incongruous , may find the exact combination of words that make a sentence into a gag ? but after that , the task moves into his fingers . The unforgettable moment must now be translated into just the right lines , just the right bodily posture and facial expression to capture the moment of mirth in one laugh-provoking drawing . " A cartoon is really just a tiny stage , " says Ted . " The artist is dramatist , producer , director , and stagehand all in one . He designs the scene . He builds his own props . He puts his characters on stage in their proper places . Then he puts dialogue into their mouths ? or perhaps does not . " But he has just one , single , tiny moment on his stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blackout . You get it , or you do n't , in a single flash . Light moves at 186,000 miles per second , and brain nerve impulses get along at 120 meters per second . From cartoon to brain to the facial muscles of laughter might take less time than even that ancient biblical phrase ? ' in the twinkling of an eye . ' But the eye must indeed twinkle , or the cartoonist is dead . " Well , Ted Key is one of the live-est men who ever lived . We find him on a spring morning in his home at Valley Forge . The house was once the place where staff officers of a rebel called George Washington pored over their maps and tried to figure out how to beat the Redcoats and the Hessians , while outside the snow was reddened with the blood of unshod American troops , and patriots died quietly on every side from hunger and cold . A house like this has an unparalleled beauty . Old stones in its walls were put there by the hands of Colonials . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( The general was known as the best horseman in America . ) Today the beauty is more serene . An ancient wishing well . A garden of wildflowers . Walks of burnished brick , with the patina of generations gleaming underfoot , deep coloration only time can confer . Ancient trees shade the house . On the front door , ' an iron artifact shows two hands clasped in friendship . A good omen for any visitor . The host is a man who likes people and gives everyone the same chance . He is warm and outgiving . He likes his home , and he likes visitors in it . This home is for enjoyment rather than for show . There are antiques everywhere and primitive paintings . Small rooms , so beautifully proportioned that they offer privacy and expansiveness at the same time . The heart of this house Ted Key 's studio ? is upstairs . It is a room for all seasons . To the right of his easel , you look out past an ancient weather vane set on a flange of roof , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible beyond . Surrounding the artist are books , books , books . And ? so much a giveaway ? on the walls the art of the French Impressionists . Especially the posters of Toulouse-Lautrec , painter of the strong line , the curving form , and the image that strikes the beholder all in one bold thrust . Ted talks about his own art . He has thrust ? " too much of it , " he says , smiling at an early failure , " at least for Disney . I worked in Walt 's studios , but my line was too hard and strong . I went // right at it . And they wanted something a little more indirect . So then I went on to Hollywood . " There was no trace of regret in his voice . " I attack , " he says . " It 's me versus the paper . Disney wanted a light line . I could n't draw well enough for him . " The artist who is envied by every man on the Disney staff today smiles slightly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Key might have been left in the Disney cartoon mill for life , except for that unhappy-happy experience . But something was working in him now to come out , and that was writing . Ted Key is a many-sided man . He was born in Fresno , California , of a poor family . But there was a kind of magic in the family , too . His father , born in Riga , Russia , as a young man went to South Africa and soldiered for Queen Victoria in the Boer War . From there to Baltimore , Maryland , where he strolled the streets one day and chanced upon a pretty girl he had known in Riga ! " Chanced upon ! " ? imagine . There was no doubt of it , they would marry . But should they re-turn to Johannesburg , where he wanted to go , or join her brother in California ? They flipped a coin . It must have been the comic face of the coin that came up heads : California it was . And so Ted Key 's career was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Good Hope . when he was ready he went . He ran into an early dichotomy of interests there . Stick-drawing pictures in the dust and the books on the library shelves were at war within him . He became art editor of the college newspaper and associate editor of the Pelican , California 's great humor magazine of the thirties . He was an art major , and it was at Berkeley that he picked up his love of the Impressionists , and of the guileless primitive paintings such as those hanging now in his Valley Forge home . The Disney failure was the beginning of the turning point in his life . Ted went on his pocket . Meanwhile , Fields was at leisure to bask in a swimming pool of martinis , and by the time the agent had almost entirely queered the deal , although there still was some life in it , there was n't much life in the quixotic old comedian . Fields was trundled off to a sanatorium to soak it out instead of up , and our hero Ted was left out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That blew Ted clean out of Hollywood . He fled to the New York City marketplace , traveling by luxurious Greyhound bus . He began selling cartoons for eating money ? to the oldies of that day like Judge , Collier 's , Bally- hoo , and Life ( which was a comic humor magazine , then ) . In due time , banging his typewriter as well as touching brush to drawing paper , he became a top radio scriptwriter for the big Manhattan ad agency , J. Walter Thompson . That Hollywood agent could not have seared Ted 's soul too deeply . It was now that he attended a meeting of the National Cartoonists ' Society and met yet another agent , this one called Anne . He married her . Ted sums it up succinctly . " I saved the ten percent . " But the choice loomed . He was winning prizes for his radio plays . " Was I going to stay at the office and write , or work in my studio at home and watch my kids grow up ? " ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the order of their appearance . ) Ted went home . After that , the rockets started to blaze off as he sold cartoons to every magazine and newspaper in the world , wrote and illustrated cartoon-y books , and , of course , created Hazel for The Saturday Evening Post . How does he do it ? " I am not a witty man . I watch life . I do n't take a fixed point of view . All things and all people change , and it 's a great mistake to freeze your point of view . ' Stay light on your toes . ' " Ted is drawing again for the Post , as you may have noticed in this issue and the // previous one . But the backbone of his work is his syndication of " Hazel , " appearing six times weekly in over 200 newspapers and reaching a circulation of over I 1 million readers via King Features . At 8:30 every morning except Sunday he is at the drawing room in his shipshape little studio . He plans on six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fast as the syndication sucks them in , working far in advance . But not one Hazel a day . Monday is for thinking about Hazel and slashing off a number of rough sketches . Situations . Facial expressions . " I sit in front of that board and make myself think , even if the product is not professional each time . " Tuesday he decides on six of the sketches that seem to click the best . Then he settles down ? a medium lead pencil on Strathmore three-ply paper , and then to thin pen lines over the pencil , erasure of the pencil work , and finally the flourish of black-ink brush . And thus ? Hazel is reborn again for millions of admirers . All of this is good for Ted Key . He plays hard , too . But not to win . " Games should be played as games , not an extension of life . When people take games seriously , life stops being fun . " Ted likes tennis . You get the message that he might be hard to beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a loser who made it . " That 's the kind of guy to avoid facing across the net . What now for Ted ? He is happy with his family , and at the peak of his success . He has a summer place at Ocean City which is the envy of visitors . He is vigorous ? looking ten years younger than his fifty-odd years ? fit , and full of beans ... curious about everything . " I 'm trying to find time to write again , rather than to paint . I 'd like to have enough of a chance at writing so that I 've had at least the time to fail , if you see what I mean . ' Time ' ? that 's the secret . The one thing , and perhaps the only thing a man owns in this world is something he was born with , and has the choice to use as he will , and that is Time . " I would n't mind if it did n't come off . When I was starting out as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were people with more talent , but I just worked harder . I felt defeat as deeply as anyone , but it left no permanent scars. 1 used to get so mad at those editors and their rejection slips . ' Someday they 'll be sorry , those idiots . ' Though , of course , they were one hundred percent right . They had evaluated my work for what it actually was ? third rate . Now I 've learned and I think maybe it 's better . I stayed with it long enough to learn . " He thinks a bit about Hazel , and slowly the writer ? that marvelous writer in Ted Key ? comes to the surface . " 1 have tried to make Hazel as complex and human a personality as possible , a flesh-and-blood creature and not merely a pen-and-ink sketch . And I believe her readers think of her as a real , warm , and quite challenging human being . " How many children can identify themselves with a maid ? Few have ever seen one . And yet Hazel is tremendously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is common to all of them the rebellion against authority . She upsets apple carts , and the status quo ; they 're always trying to . But she compensates for them by succeeding . " Matrons who have had maids for years think Hazel is exactly like every maid they 've ever had . Conversely , maids believe she speaks only for them Women who work in offices , or who have hired only baby-sitters , see in her a vociferous symbol of their sex , for centuries an underdog minority group . Any person who holds a job under a superior views her as fellow employee ? the underdog , like themselves , saying or doing things they wish they could say , or do ( for example , telling off the boss ) . The boss , in turn , has had to put up with people like her ? independents , the unorganizational man , the nonconformist ? almost every day in his life . Anyone who revolts against the pattern , the mold , or who has ever had the desire to ( and this desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this woman . " Some years ago a subscriber who was a minister suggested that Hazel be ejected from the Post as overbearing and obnoxious . Two years later he wrote the editors and apologized . He now thought that she was the warmest , most endearing character he had ever known . In those two years he saw other facets in her makeup which not only made her endurable but lovable . " Hazel is basically a sympathetic , warm , compassionate woman , in great need of love , and giving it . Her wisecracks , her wit , and the dominating , aggressive take charge ' attitude are a defensive bastion . But she 's an unfulfilled woman and knows it . And when the armor cracks , we are torn by the poignancy . She does n't stay exposed long , though , for Hazel 's best defense is an offense . And an overwhelming sense of humor . " But still , in the late evening hours back in that nicely appointed , lived-in rear bedroom , its furniture decked with the photos of dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are confronted with a human being . A small phonograph plays cool jazz . There's. a portable TV set , turned off ; she prefers the one downstairs . This woman , like any other , has plans ; she has hopes and dreams . Hazel lies in her bed , in her room , in her home . And in this home , she is alone . "
