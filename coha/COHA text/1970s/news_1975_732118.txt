txt The Ford administration 's strategy to convince the nation that this year 's grain sales to the Soviet Union are justified is based on three main points : ? American consumers will have to pay only 1 to 11/2 percent more for food in supermarkets as the result of the sales , the administration says . Most of this increase is still to come . ? If the controversial sales had not been made , prices would have been higher next year anyway . Without overseas sales farmers ' income this year would go down , causing them to plant less grain and raise fewer livestock next year ? producing a shortage which would cause supermarket prices to rise in 1976 . ? The Soviet Union probably will need more grain this year ? and the U.S. will provide some of it . " Further sales will be entirely desirable and necessary , " says Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz , " from the standpoint of both agriculture and the national interest . " But no new sales will be made until the impasse is settled with dock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Soviet Union // 20 By R. Norman Matheny , staff photographer American . grain how much can go overseas without pushing up U.S. prices ? *Butz : Soviet grain sales ' desirable , ' to up prices 1 1/2% // These points aimed generally at American consumers and specifically to Congress and the dockworkers were made by Secretary Butz in testimony on Capitol Hill Sept. , 4 . Mr. Butz argues that the sales would not ' cause a significant rise in baked goods , cereals , meats , and poultry . Democrats particularly have held that American consumers would bear the burden of the sales ? paying substantially higher supermarket prices while grain exporting firms reap the profits from the sales of some 10.3 million tons of grain . Congress recalls that in 1972 Secretary Butz similarly assured Americans that sales of grain to the Soviet Union that year would have minimal effect on the price of American food ? but that some products which directly or indirectly use grain shot up , bringing angry complaints from consumers and Congress that the sales were the cause . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be little effect this year . Overall ; he says , consumers can expect a 9 percent retail food price rise this year ? of which only 11/2 percent is attribut. able to the grain deals . Arthur Burns ; chairman of the Federal Reserve linard , . thinks this year 's grain deals will raise supermarket prices a little more than Mr. Butz. does ? from 2 to 21/2 percent next year . Preceding Mr. Butz in testimony Thursday before the Senate Agriculture Committee , he told Democratic Sen. Dick Clark ? from a major farming state , Iowa that ' three-fourths " of this rise will come in higher prices of meat and meat products . The reason , - Mr . Burns explained , is that higher prices for corn and other feed grains will cause - farmers and rapchers " to tend to produce and market less meat , poultry , eggs , and milk . in 1976 than they otherwise would have . Prices of these items will therefore be higher than they would have been . " For his part , Secretary Butz says it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he now forecasts " if the record U.S. crop prospects should deteriorate between now and harvest time , and if export demand were to expand sharply bgyond current expectations . " . ? Mr. Burns reminded committee Members that because the U.S. has cultivated foreign food markets in the past , it now has the obligation to fulfill the needs of nations which have come to rely on American foodstuffs . " In developing these markets , " he told senators in a crowded Agriculture Committee hearing.room , " we have also assumed responsibilities . " Other ? nations who have been customers " need assurance that they will have access to our markets on a regular basis . "
