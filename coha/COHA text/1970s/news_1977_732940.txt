txt On Counting Poems , Cases and Dollars Poetic Justice ? We leave to critics on other pages the charge lately leveled by a group of poets that the American Poetry Review , a major outlet for contemporary poetry , is " suffocating ... new voices . " A serious matter if true . The accusatory manifesto , however , seems peculiarly prosaic in its accounting approach ? of 658 contributions , it notes , only 116 were by women ana only 56 by black , minority or third world writers  --  and in its call for the publication of " a proportional number of highest quality men , women and minority poets . " Until the Muse begins to allocate poetic talent equitably according to sex , age . race , religion , ethnic origin and other variables , the phrase " proportional number " will not sit comfortably with the phrase " highest quality . " In the past , when writers felt that a literary journal was suffocatingly conservative , they would do their best to kick the editor out or start a competing journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon him . We trust that the manifesto 's passing mention that the Review receives Federal funds was not designed as a threat . The affirmative action needed to make a good poem is not likely to originate in a Washington computer . ? Swift Justice Last Sept. 11 , while a young woman named Karen Singer was walking her beagle along the bridle path in Central Park , she was mugged , and stabbed in the heart . She died shortly afterward . We called , a few days later , for " speedy and certain justice " for the perpetrators of that crime . As it happens , the case was handled in the office of the Manhattan District Attorney with efficiency and dispatch . Oswald Diaz was brought before a grand jury and within two weeks of the crime was charged with felony murder and intentional murder . He was convicted on both counts on Jan , 24 . He could face sentences of 25 years to life on each count . Since four months from crime to conviction was substantially speedier justice than we had expected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it happened . The greater efficiency seems to be the result of a recent redeployment of personnel under which experienced lawyers are assigned to the complaint room where the cases first come in . They screen and dispose of felony charges at the earliest stages , getting rid of bad cases quickly and moving good cases along more expeditiously . One result has been a substantially reduced caseload . In April of 1975 , there were 4,000 indictments pending in Manhattan Supreme Court . By the beginning of December that number had been reduced to 2,550 . On July I , 1976 , 115 indictments were pending against 93 defendants who had been in custody more than a year . By the end of the year the figures had been reduced to 12 indictments against 9 defendants . All of this is of little solace to Karen Singer 's relatives and friends , but the fact that swifter and surer justice is now dispensed in Manhattan may make its streets somewhat safer . ? Private Justice The Department of Justice has suffered enough black eyes in recent years that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be misunderstood . The issue arises from the disclosure that the department has hired outside lawyers to defend present and former Federal officials in civil cases charging improper Federal surveillance . The news has caused some raised eyebrows on Capitol Hill and disconcerted Federal budgeteers . These concerns seem to us unwarranted , Citizens sue Federal officials a hundred times each week . Routinely , the suits are defended by the department 's Civil Division , in the interest of the United States  --  that is , the Federal Government . But what is the Federal interest when the Civil Division is asked to defend officials just as its sister Criminal Division is looking into the same facts for possible prosecution ? How much sense does it make for the same " United States " to prosecute and defend the same issue ? None , which is why former Attorney General Edward Levi authorized the employment of outside lawyers to defend the civil cases . That was a decent , correct decision .                  @ @ @
