" Almighty God said , I think I 'll raise him up to persuade Newfoundlanders to join Canada . If he persuades them , Newfoundland is going to need a Premier . ' " And that , as Joey Smallwood liked to confide at political gatherings , was more or less how he came to be called , in one of his favorite phrases , " the Only Living Father of Confederation . " Others prefer to describe him as the " Kwame Nkrumah of Newfoundland . " Until he retired last week from the province 's Liberal Party leadership after 23 years of almost absolute power , Smallwood was one of the Western Hemisphere 's most benign demagogues and Canada 's most entertaining politician . As he often put it : " I 'm sort of a tourist attraction . " <P> Characteristically , Smallwood until the last minute had Canada 's wintry , easternmost province in an uproar over whether , at 71 , he might somehow hear a call to remain in politics , or even wangle his way back into office . Narrowly defeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the results in court and held on to the premiership until mid-January . Newfoundland 's Liberals named as party leader Smallwood 's former executive assistant and onetime local health minister Ed Roberts , 31 . Said Smallwood : " There 's no future for me whatsoever . I 'm through with politics . " <P> A little man with the face of a thoughtful , testy owl , Smallwood ran his " poor , bald rock , " as he once called Newfoundland , as a personal fiefdom . Nonetheless , he was dearly loved by most of the 500,000 Newfies- " a community of Irish mystics cut adrift in the Atlantic , " in the colorful phrase of Novelist Paul West-and his picture adorned the poorest living rooms in tiny fishing ports with names like Blow-me-down and Come-by-Chance .

The son of a lumber surveyor who died of alcoholism , Joey was a school dropout at 15 . His first full-time job was as a reporter for a newspaper in St. John 's . Smitten with socialism , he emigrated to New York City , where he wrote inflammatory stories for the socialist daily Call . Returning to Newfoundland in 1925 , Joey became a labor leader and at one point " walked myself down to skin and grief " over 600 miles of railroad track to organize the section men . <P> Newfoundland was a British dependency at the time . When Britain offered the islanders the choice of independence or union with Canada after World War II , Smallwood saw opportunity , rallied the proconfederation forces to win a hard-fought referendum and took over the premiership .
