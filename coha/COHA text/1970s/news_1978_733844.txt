txt The great money game is on in Washington , with Congress and White House vying to show the folks back home how much fat they can cut from government snendine . " Mock competition , " scoffs a senior Carter administration official , citing the coming fiscal 1979 budget as an example . President Carter 's original budget called for a $61.7 ? billion deficit , later whittled down by the Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) to about $42 bil'jon . Congress , at the end of its own complex budget process , comes up with aprojected fiscal 1979 budget shortfall of $38.8 billion . So Congress is ahead on saving money ? Not really , says a White House official , who ticks off how Congress shaved that $20-odd billion from the budget . A smaller tax cut , he says , will bring at least $10 billion additional revenue to the Treasury . And the congressional budget committees , banking on the experience of past years , estimate that government agencies will spend about $10 billion less than authorized by the budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing from the President 's budget . " In fact , " he adds , " Congress deleted $2.5 billion from the Carter budget mostly in urban programs and tacked on $3 billion mostlyin highway and water projects . " How , then , did the White House arrive at its lower budget estimates ? By the same devices , concedes a senior source ? smaller tax cut and anticipated spending shortfall ? plus some minor cuts in spending . Mr. Carter still has up his sleeve about $2.5 billion in additional budget cuts , which he will ask Congress to approve after the Christmas holidays . The upshot should be a 1979 budget shortfall in the range of $38 billion to $40 billion ? well below this year 's expected red ink figure of just over $50 billion . Now the crunch is on for fiscal 1980 , with the President sending word out to his Cabinet departments to cut and cut again . And , in case some Cabinet chiefs fail // From page 1 Budget-ax duel to get the message , the OMB , under James T. McIntyre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still undecided is whether the President will aim , at a specific deficit figure ? say , $30 billion ? or be more general , when - he presents the fiscal 1980 budget to Congress next January . ; ( Fiscal years begin Oct. 1 and run through Sept. 30 of the next calendar year . Fiscal 1979 began Oct . I , 1978 . ) Clearly , said a White House official , there will be little if any room for new social or other spending programs . Some cuts even are planned in " mandated " programs ? those whose outlays are governed by law , such as social security . Two examples : As the law now reads , a person who retires , On the 29th of a month gets the full social-security benefits for that month . But if Congress approves a White House proposal , the retiree would collect benefits for only the second half of the month . This change alone would save the government many millions of dollars yearly . Again , under current practice , the family of a veteran who passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social security , the other from the Veterans Administration . One payment would be eliminated , if approved by Congress . Only if some paring of mandated programs takes place , officials say , can the 1980 budget deficit be trimmed , since the economy may grow only about 3 percent at an annual rate late in 1979 and into 1980 . Faster growth would swell Treasury tax revenues and shrink the deficit even more . " A vote against instincts " is the way one official describes the phenomenon that a Democratic president and Democratic Congress are willing to sacrifice new social spending to achieve budget stringency , at least this year and next .
