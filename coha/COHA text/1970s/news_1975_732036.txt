txt At close to the 11th hour , a national consensus to fight 25 percent a year inflation and put Britain back on the road to economic health seems to be shaping up . The mood was palpable among delegates to the mineworkers ' annual conference here , who beat down extremist attempts to demand a whopping ? 100 ( $230 ) a week wage for coalface workers . It underlay the Trade Union Congress leaders ' acceptance , after hours of discussions at the Treasury , to hold down pay raise claims in the next annual round of a flat ? 6 ( $13.80 ) a week for everyone instead of demanding 30 percent increases as heretofore . It could be felt in Committee Room 10 of the House of Commons , where Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey told Labour MPs : " There can be a 10 percent cut in our standard of living and a 10 percent cut in our public expenditures ? or we would have to crawl to the IMF the International Monetary Fund and accept the terms they impose on us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency confronting Britain today is quite different from the dark but uplifting days of Dunkirk in World War II . The country is living on borrowed money , and economic selfishness and fear for the future seem to have set group against group and interest against interest . The rhetoric of the country 's leaders seems to have been almost played out . Prime Minister Harold Wilson did not get more than polite applause Monday when he told the miners that he was asking ; " not a year for self , but a year for Britain . " Neither did militant leftists , like Yorkshire miners ' leader Arthur Scargill , who shouted out Tuesday to his fellow delegates , " No one can tell me that a miner is n't worth ? 100 a week in 1975 . " Yet at last , this week , long-awaited national decisions are being hammered out , not in the atmosphere of confrontation and social strife that many had feared , but in a sober toning down of pay claims and a realization by management and trade unionists alike that there have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be fair . The pound has marked time on international exchange markets , and Arab oil producers have not withdrawn their surplus funds . Britain 's creditors , " the people who can pull the trapdoor from under us , " as Mr. Healey grimly put it , " are waiting for our pronouncement . " That pronouncement is to take the form of a white paper at the end of the week , which will be debated in Parliament early next week . It is almost certain that the government will ask for some kind of statutory authority to make sure wages will not exceed the 10 percent increase the Chancellor has allowed for . // * Putting Britain back on recovery track // The voluntary agreement shaping up between the trade unions and management will have behind it the constraint of legal sanctions . It is less clear what specific cuts in its own expenditures the government will propose , and the opposition Conservatives keep repeating that without substantial sacrifices here , the whole anti-inflation program will be ineffective . What happened at the mine workers ' conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working people as reflected by their union delegates . Mr.Scargill 's militant Yorkshire delegation had stubbornly insisted on a resolution calling for ? 100 a week for coal-face workers ? miners who actually cut coal underground  --  and proportionate increases for others . ( Coalface workers now receive ? 61 a week . ) The union 's national executive , on which Mr. Scargill also sits , tried time and again to obtain a compromise . The Yorkshiremen remained adamant and at one stage they seemed to be winning a narrow majority of the 267 delegates attending the conference . President Joe Gormley and Prime Minister Wilson made their respective public appeals Monday without visibly budging the Scargill line . But Tuesday , as secret meeting succeeded secret meeting , the patience and persistence of the moderates began to pay off . Could not " seek " be substituted for " demand " ? Undecided delegations began to fall away from the Yorkshire line and urge a single compromise resolution that could be accepted by the whole conference . Finally Mr. Scargill agreed to " seek , " not demand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in plenary session to propose the amended resolution . In 18 minutes , it was all over : The conference unanimously approved the compromise resolution and a relieved Joe Gormley was quoted as saying " I feel a lot better now . I think we have got a sensible approach . "
