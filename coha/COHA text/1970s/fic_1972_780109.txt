 | other room ; the straw mattress would be flattened under her more than generous frame . Fanny was not a woman easy to get along with . Everything seemed to displease her . She was without friends . Not a soul ever came to call . She liked no one . She had thought the Irish woman her brother-in-law had married was inferior because of her people , a race she declared was always warring against the crown because it was their nature to fight , and now Heather bore the brunt of that malicious hatred . Not a day went by that it was n't thrown up to Heather that she was half foreign . And with the prejudice was an emotion that ran deeper , twisting Fanny 's reasoning until she half believed that like the mother , the daughter was part witch . Call it jealousy perhaps , for Fanny Simmons had never been pretty , not even remotely so , whereas the colleen , Brenna , had possessed great beauty and charm . Men 's heads turned when she walked into a room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sadly enough , the aunt 's criticism along with it . The gaming houses had claimed payment for Richard 's losses at their tables , taking every material possession he had had but a few personal artifacts and some clothing . Fanny had hastened to London to declare her husband 's right of blood , snatching up the orphaned niece and her meager inheritance before a protest could be made . She had grumbled because Richard had not shared his wealth nor left it behind for them , then sold the goods , all but one gown , a pink one that Heather was not even allowed to wear , and greedily pocketed the money . Heather straightened her aching back and sighed . " Heather Simmons ! " The words rang from the other room and the bed creaked as her aunt rose from it . " You lazy flit , stop your daydreaming and get to work . Do you think your chores will be gettin ' done while you mope around here ? I swear a body would think that lady 's school you went to would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those highhanded notions what fill your head ! " The huge woman padded across the dirt floor into the room , and Heather mentally braced herself . She knew what was coming . " See what good it done you ? ' aving to live off your only kin . Your pa were a fool , that he was , throwing away his money without a care o ' nobody but hisself , all on account o ' that flip he married  --  that Irish girl . " She spat the words out in distaste as if she could think of noth- ing worse . " We tried to warn him against wedding her . But he would n't listen ? ' e had to have Brenna . " Heather lifted her gaze wearily from the shaft of sunlight drifting in from the open doorway to the large bulk of her aunt . She had heard the argument so often she knew it by heart ; it failed to shake her kinder memories of her father . " He was a good father , " she said simply . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman sneered . " See what fix he left you in . No dowry an ' eighteen you 'll be next month . Ai n't no man what 'll marry you without one , though they 'll be wanting you all right  --  to fill their beds . I got me poor hands full , trying to keep you decent . I ai n't wanting you to spill no bastards in me home . Folks here is just waiting for that . They knows what trash your ma was . Heather flinched , but her aunt ranted on , turning her narrowed eyes upon her and shaking a damning finger . " The devil done his work when he made you just like her . A witch , she was . ' Taint natural for you to have the same looks . And so she ruined your pa , so you 'll be ruining every man what lays his eyes on you . ' T is the Lord 's will what brought you to me . He knew I could save you from the fire an ' brimstone you were meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy gowns you had . You were too vain an ' uppity for your own good . Them old dresses of mine have done nicely for you . " Heather could almost laugh . If it were n't so sad she would . Her aunt 's clothes hung about her worse than any sack , for the woman outweighed her twice over . This was all that she was permitted to wear , old rags that made a mockery of style or design . Fanny had even forbidden Heather to take in the seams to make them fit better , only to shorten the hems , so she would n't trip . The woman caught Heather 's contemplation of her hand-me-down and sneered . " Ungrateful little beggar . Just tell me where you 'd have been today if your uncle an ' me ' ad n't taken you in ? If your pa would ' ave ' ad good sense , he 'd ' ave married you off with a nice dowry . But no , he kept you to hisself , thinking you too young to wed . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be buried a spinster when you die  --  and a virgin , too , that I 'll see to . " Fanny returned once more to the cottage 's only other room , giving Heather a warning that she 'd best hurry with her chores or suffer under the bite of a switch . Heather 's fingers sped at their task . She had felt the sting of that branch . Red welts usually criss-crossed her back  | for days following a whipping . Fanny seemed to take special delight in marking Heather 's bare flesh . Heather dared not release another exhausted sigh , for fear it would  | draw her aunt 's attention again , but she was weary of her labors . She had been up since before dawn , preparing a feast for Fanny 's anxiously awaited brother , and she doubted her ability to last much longer . A letter had arrived several days before , informing Fanny that he would be coming this evening , and she had ordered Heather to start preparations immediately upon receipt of the note ; she had even lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a saucer . Heather knew the man was someone her aunt held very dear indeed . She had heard many glorious tales about him , and guessed that Fanny 's brother was the only being , human or otherwise , that she cared anything about . Uncle John had confirmed Heather 's beliefs when he told her there was nothing Fanny would n't do for the man . There had been only the two of them , and being ten years her brother 's senior she had raised him from a babe . But it was very rare nowadays that he came to call . The sun was a red ball flaming low in the west before everything lay ready . Fanny came to give her final approval and directed Heather to set out more candles to light later . " It 's five summers since I laid my poor eyes on my brother , and I want everything to be nice for him . My Willy 's used to the best of London , and I wo n't be having him find fault with what 's here . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My brother 's got lots of money cause he uses his head . " She gestured to her own large head to make her point . " You do n't see him in no gaming houses throwing away his wealth nor sitting on his prat like your uncle . He 's a man what makes his own chances , he does . Ai n't no finer clothier 's shop than what he 's got in London . He even has a man what works for him , he does . " She finally gave the blessed command for Heather to go and freshen up . " An ' Heather , wear that gown your pa give you . It 'll do nicely . I want my brother 's visit to be a happy occasion without the likes of those rags you 're wearing marring it . " Heather turned around , eyes wide with surprise . For two years her pink gown had remained tucked away , untouched and unworn . Now she would be allowed to wear it . Even if it was for the pleasure of her aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternity since she had worn anything pretty , and now she smiled in anticipation . " Aye , I see you 're pleased . Always thinking how pretty you look in  | those fine dresses , you are . " Fanny pressed close and wagged her finger under Heather 's nose . " Satan is at his work again . Mind you , the Lord knows what a task you are for me . " She sighed heavily , as if tired of her burden . " It 's better that you were married and off me hands . But I pity the man who would wed you , though there ai n't no chance of that without a dowry . You need a strong man to keep you tied down and burdened with his babe every year . You need it to take the witch from your evil soul . " Heather shrugged her shoulders and continued to smile . She longed for the nerve to frighten her aunt into believing she was really a witch . It would be a heathenish thing to do and the temptation would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea quickly ebbed away . The consequences would not be light . " Another thing , missy , wear your hair coiled round your head . It 'll do nicely indeed , " Aunt Fanny smirked slyly , knowing how much her niece disliked being told how to wear her hair . The smile quickly faded from Heather 's face , but she turned away murmuring an affirmative answer . Her aunt waited for disapproval of her commands to be expressed in the slightest way ; she took it upon herself to hand out discipline with harsh methods . Heather crossed the room and moved behind the curtain separating her small corner from the rest of the living area . She heard her aunt leave the cottage and it was only then she dared allow a mutinous pout to show . She was angry , but more at herself than at her aunt . She had always been a coward and the way things were going she would always be one . The dreary cubicle held but the barest necessities , yet it was here she sought succor from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light the short candle on the shoddy table beside the narrow rope cot . " If only I were stronger and braver , " she thought , " then I would set her back on her heels . If just once I could retort in kind to her needling . " She flexed a slim arm with a wry smile fleeting across her lips . " But I 'd have to be Samson to wrestle her ! " Earlier she had set an ewer of warm water and a washbowl in her room and now Heather stretched in anticipation of the bath . With a distasteful grimace , she half tore the hated dress she wore from her body . Standing naked , she relaxed and ran her hands down her slender body , wincing when her fingers touched a bruise . Aunt Fanny had flown into a rage the day before when she had accidently knocked over  | a cup of tea , and before she could flee the woman had laid the bundle of a straw broom heavily across her buttocks . With tender care Heather removed the pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could caress it as she bathed . The water was refreshing and she scrubbed vigorously until her skin blushed with a youthful glow . She worked the cloth over a small sliver of scented soap she had scavenged and lathered herself liberally , reveling in the pungent fragrance . Her toilette complete , she drew the gown carefully over her shabby chemise . The bodice of the gown had been made for a younger girl . The fabric was tight across her breasts , and she pondered on her growth and considered the daring swell above the low decolletage , then dismissed the problem with a shrug of her shoulders . It was her only gown and it was too late an hour to contemplate alterations . In delightful luxury , she brushed her hair until it gleamed in the candlelight . This had been her father 's pride , something he had treasured and often stroked in absent thought as , she surmised , he had done with her mother . More than once he had stared at her as if dreaming and in deep longing , murmured his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away with misty eyes . As directed , she coiled her hair around her head , but left a few stray curls to tumble down the back in feigned disarray and another on each temple in rare defiance . She surveyed herself in the piece of broken glass that served as a mirror and nodded her head . She had done better than she expected with the crude materials at hand . On the other side of the curtain , Heather heard someone enter the cottage and move about the room ; there was a deep hacking cough . She stepped around the drapery , knowing it was her uncle . He was lighting his pipe with a wood splint from the fire and he coughed again as it took light . Swirls of smoke filled the room . John Simmons was a broken man . He had little to care about in his life but his miserly guarded money and the doubtful companionship of Aunt Fanny and had ceased to worry about his appearance . His shirt was grease stained and dirt was thick under his nails . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood before Heather a stooped and withered man who appeared well beyond his two score and ten years . His eyes held a lackluster film of broken dreams and crushed hopes and frustration-filled days under his wife 's heckling . His hands were gnarled and twisted with the years of backbreaking labor eking a shallow subsistence from the marshy land , and his  | weather-thickened skin held the pain of the passing seasons etched in deep lines that furrowed his face . He glanced up and saw the soft beauty of his niece and something of a new pain seemed to fleet across his features . He sat back in his chair and smiled . " You 're looking lovely this evening , child . I 'm supposing it be for William 's visit ? " " Aunt Fanny gave me permission , Uncle , " she answered . He sucked on the pipe a moment as his teeth tightened upon it . " Aye , I can believe that , " he sighed . " She goes to great lengths to please him though he 's a cold man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to speak with her . Now , she dare not go for fear of angering him , and he 's satisfied with it thus . He has his wealthy friends and would n't think of claiming her his kin . " A slightly blurred portrait of his sister , William Court was even the same height as Fanny , which was a full head taller than Heather . Perhaps he was not quite as obese , but Heather surmised that difference would diminish in a few years . His pudgy face was ruddy , with heavy jowls , and he possessed a protruding underlip which was constantly wet with saliva . He dabbed at it continuously with a lacy handkerchief , making sniffing noises as if it were his nose he wiped . When he held Heather 's hand in greeting his was sickeningly soft , and when he bent to kiss her hand , she had a vague feeling of revulsion . The clothes he wore bespoke of elegant taste , but his mincing manner did little to enhance a masculine mien . The suit of soft grey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock seemed to accentuate his pinkish hands and wheezing red face . William Court may have been wealthy , but Heather could find little to attract her . His trousers were extremely tight , almost to a point of discomfort it seemed , and it could be guessed that they had been deliberately cut thus to display to the casual eye his otherwise questionable manhood . He had arrived in a rented landau with a precisely dressed coachman who was sent to the barn to bed down with his two dapple-grey horses . Heather sensed the driver was put out with his lowly accommodations since he himself was better dressed than the occupants of the cottage . The barn was hardly fit for his animals . But if he were annoyed he said nothing , going silently about his work , tending the horses and carriage . Aunt Fanny , with her grey hair pulled tightly against her large head , looked like a forboding fortress in her stiffly starched gown and  | apron . In spite of her past ranting and raving about how fancy clothes were the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother prosperously dressed and bustled about him like a hen over a baby chick . Heather had never seen her so affectionate to any individual , and it was kindly received by William Court who obviously enjoyed being waited upon hand and foot . She ignored her aunt 's drooling endearments and did n't attend closely to their conversation until at dinner it drifted to the current news from London . Then she began to listen intently in hopes of hearing news of old friends . " Napoleon escaped and now everyone believes him to be on his way back to France after his defeat in Egypt . Nelson taught him a thing or two . He 'll think twice before tangling with our seamen again , by Jove ! " William Court swore . Heather noted that his speech was considerably better than his sister 's and she wondered if he had attended a school . Aunt Fanny wiped her mouth with the back of her hand and snarled . " Pitt did n't know what he was talking about when he said leave the French be . Now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irish too . I say kill ' em all ! " Heather bit her lip . " The Irish ! Ha ! Pack of animals they are , if you ask me ! They do n't know when they 're happy and well offl " Aunt Fanny continued . " Pitt is trying to form a union with them now . Perhaps next year it will go through , " Uncle John said . " Per'aps we 'll have our throats slit by the bloody lot of them , too ! " Heather glanced hesitantly to her uncle , uneasy as always with her aunt 's prejudice . John lowered his eyes and drained his ale in one breath . He sighed and cast a longing glance to the jug Fanny guarded , then set his mug upon the hearth and silently returned to his pipe . " The Yankee 's the same ! They 'll cut your throat rather than look at you . We 'll have them to fight again , mark my word . " William chuckled , his jowls quivering with amusement . " It would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister , for they come into port as if they owned the place . A few get snatched for impressment , but they 're a careful lot and stay to themselves . When they venture into the city they go in numbers . They do n't like the idea of sailing on British ships . Aye , they 're a careful lot and some have the audacity to think themselves gentlemen . Look at that fellow Washington , for instance . And now they have that other fool , Adams , whom they 've elected as their king . It 's outrageous ! But it wo n't last . They 'll come back , whining like the dogs they are ! "  | Heather did n't know any Yankees . She was simply glad that her aunt and Mr. Court were discussing them instead of the Irish . She let her attention slide from the conversation . As long as they did not talk of London society or her ancestors she was not interested . If she dared speak up and declare her loyalty to them or ask if there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descend on her viciously . As it was , her thoughts wandered elsewhere and she sat for what seemed an eternity . Aunt Fanny brought Heather out of her shell ; she reached across the table and maliciously pinched her arm . Heather jumped . She rubbed her arm , where a red welt was forming , and looked up at her aunt , blinking back tears of pain . " I asked you if you wanted to teach at Lady Cabot 's finishing school . My brother thinks he may be able to find you work , " Aunt Fanny snapped . Heather could hardly believe her ears . " What ? " William Court laughed and explained . " I 've very good connections with the school , and I know they 're looking for a young lady of quality , and you do have excellent manners and good speech . You would , I believe , be perfect for the position , and I understand you also attended a school in London which will be of much help . " He dabbed at his massive lips before continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable marriage for you with a prominent family in town . It would seem a shame to waste such ladylike grace on a farm yokel here . Of course , if I do arrange such a contract , it would mean supplying you with a substantial dowry which I 'll expect to be repaid when you have your man secure . It 's a slight trick , but could be profitable to each of us . You 're in want of a dowry , which I can supply , and I 'd favor the interest on the loan which you can provide afterwards . No one need know of such an arrangement and I know you 're wise enough to obtain the money after you 're married . Would this position at Lady Cabot 's be acceptable to you ? " Heather was not sure about William Court 's marriage scheme , but ? to get away from this farm , Aunt Fanny , her boring existence ! To once again be near London society  --  it would be marvelous ! If it were n't for the stinging of her arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speak up , child . What is your answer ? " plied William . Hardly able to suppress her glee , she did not hesitate further . " The offer is most kind of you , sir , and I 'll be happy to . " William laughed again . " Good ! Good ! You 'll not regret your deci- sion . " He rubbed his hands together . " Now , we must journey to London tomorrow . I 've been away from my business too long and I must get back to relieve my assistant . Do you think you can be ready , child ? " He waved a lace handkerchief under his nose and dabbed once again at his thick lips . " Oh , yes , sir . Whenever you choose to leave I 'll be ready , " she said happily . " Good , good . It 's all settled then . " Heather cleared the table and it was with a new feeling she did so , knowing it would be the last meal she would clean away in this cottage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making conversation with her aunt as the woman watched her , and when she was to herself behind her curtain she thought of all the delights of being free from Aunt Fanny . Any position in London would be superior to living under that woman 's thumb and taking her abuse . Heather would be free of the harsh words , the violent anger , and maybe , somewhere , there 'd be someone who cared . Little preparation was necessary for the next day 's journey for what she possessed was what she had worn that night and what she would wear again tomorrow . She slipped naked beneath the blanket on her cot . It was rough against her flesh and when the wind brought the chilled air of winter it failed to keep her sufficiently warm . She giggled with pleasure when she thought of not having to contend with it any longer . In less than a twelve month it would be a new century and she wondered what its years held for her now with this new chance to live and be happy . The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Heather found it a most enjoyable ride . The countryside along the way was green and lush in June . She had not noticed the same moors when she traveled to her uncle 's home two years before , but now that she went south toward London , she thought it beyond comparison in its beauty . Mr. Court proved a kind host and very attentive . She was able to talk with him at last about the current events of London society and she laughed gaily to hear his tales of the regency 's court . Once she glanced up to find him watching her with an intensity she could not fathom , but he quickly looked away . For a moment she had some slight qualms about going to London with him alone since , after all , he was not a legal guardian but a most distant cousin . The uneasiness ( ( 11  | soon faded and she mused that he was studying her for what future marriage contract he could arrange . It was dark when they reached the outskirts of London . The ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and thrown against the side of the coach every time they hit a sink hole . She was greatly relieved when they arrived at the shop . Within the place , silks , muslins , lawns , velvets and satins of all colors and textures were stacked high on tables and shelves . There was everything a woman could desire for the making of a stylish gown . Heather was amazed at the vast selection , and in her excitement hurriedly felt one cloth , carefully examined another and failed to notice a man sitting at a desk near the rear of the shop . William Court laughed as he watched her move about the room . " You 'll have more time to examine everything later , my dear , but now you must meet my assistant , Mr. Thomas Hint . " Heather turned and saw a strange little man who she instantly decided was the ugliest creature she had ever seen . Large , liquid eyes bulged from a round face and the nose was a short , flattened thing with flaring nostrils . His tongue continually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lizards she had seen on the farm . His grotesque , hunchback figure was clothed in a rich , scarlet silk that was spotted , like his shirt , with food stains . When he smiled at her it was lop-sided , with one whole side of his face compressing into a tight , horrible smirk . She thought he would look better if he did n't try to smile . In fact , she could n't see why William had him in the shop . She was positive he frightened more customers away than he attracted , and if he attracted anyone they were persons whose minds were deranged . As if in answer to her questioning thoughts , William Court spoke . " People are used to Thomas . We have a good trade here because they know we 're well skilled in our business . Is that not so , Thomas ? " He was answered with a non-committal grunt . " Now , my dear , " William continued , " I want to show you my apartments upstairs . I believe you will be pleased . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through a doorway hung with draperies and into a small room where a meager window gave off the only light . There was a stairway to one side and it led them to a dim little hallway with a single door leading from it . It was a massive wooden door , ornate compared to the dreariness of the hall . William smiled and opened it for her and Heather caught her breath in surprise at what lay behind it . The apartment was luxuriously furnished with pieces of Hepplewhite and Chippendale . A red velvet settee was  | grouped with two matching chairs upon a splendid Persian rug . Oil paintings and rich tapestries hung from light colored walls and a chandelier reflected prisms of light on red velvet draperies and their trim of gold braid and tassels . Fragile porcelain figurines were placed upon tables with candelabras of pewter , and toward the rear of the room was a place to dine . Every appointment had been carefully chosen and obviously no cost had been spared . William opened another door within this room and stepped back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-poster bed draped in royal blue velvet . A small commode was convenient to the bedside with a large candelabrum upon it and a bowl of fresh fruit . A silver-handled paring knife had been placed beside it . " Oh , sir , it is elegant , " she breathed . He took a pinch of snuff and smiled slowly as he watched her move toward a mirror standing near the bed . " I pamper myself with a few luxuries , my dear . " n 18th If she had turned at that precise moment , Heather would have been aware of what he had taken care to conceal before . His desire for her was plainly visible in his eyes as they traveled down her slender body . He turned lest she swing round and find the lust within his gaze . " You must be famished by now , Heather . " He went to a wardrobe and flung open the doors . A vivid and wide assortment of lady 's gowns hung within and he searched among them until he found a beige gown of lace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh colored material . It was a gown of much cost and beauty . " You may wear this for dinner , my dear , " he smiled . " It was made for a young girl your size but she never came back for it . I 've often wondered why she failed to , seeing it 's one of the loveliest I 've ever designed , but I suppose the girl found she could n't afford it after all . " He gazed at her from behind lowered eyelids . " It is her loss but your gain . It is my gift to you . Wear it tonight and you 'll please me greatly . " He moved to the door and there turned again to her . " I 've sent Thomas to tell cook to fetch us dinner . It should be here shortly so I beg you not to keep your sweet company from me too long . If there are other articles of clothing you need , the wardrobe is at your disposal . " Heather smiled hesitantly , holding the treasured gown to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When William closed the door 6 13  | behind him , she turned slowly to her image in the mirror , still clutching the dress to her . During the years she had lived with her aunt , Heather had not looked upon her reflection except for glimpsing it in the piece of broken glass and in occasional pools of water . She had almost forgotten the way she looked . She was now as she had seen her mother in her portrait , the very image of her . Yet she was perplexed over why people thought and remembered Brenna as being beautiful . The tall pale blond beauties who visited court and whom she had read about in her girlhood had always seemed to her to be the very essence of loveliness , not small , dark-haired women who looked like herself . Heather washed the day 's grime from her body and found a fresh chemise in the wardrobe . Donning it , she blushed at its indecent display of her body and felt more than a little wicked wearing it . It was of the softest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed her body . Its low bodice barely covered her bosom . She was too accustomed to the childish garments of her younger years to be totally at ease in the chemise , yet she could not bear to even think of wearing her own badly frayed one under such a beautiful gown . She smiled in amusement at herself . Who will see me ? Only my eyes will gaze upon this reckless creation , no one else 's . She laughed at the nonsense of it and gaily set about to do her hair . She twisted , twirled , curled and pinned the glossy black tresses into a fashionable coiffure , pulling it up and away from her face . Instead of a plain coiled hair-do , she chose to catch it into a mass of soft ringlets that cascaded over each other down the back . Concentrating a moment over her artistry , she picked up the paring knife from the table and began to cut little wisps of hair in front of her ears until each had a soft curl dangling in front of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her aunt would shriek in rage and call her loathsome names if she could but see her . Very gently she touched her finger to the knife to test its edge , as she idly thought of her aunt . At once a drop of blood stained the blade . Grimacing and holding her finger to her mouth , she put the instrument down , commenting to herself that she would be careful in the future if she wanted any fruit sliced or peeled . The beige gown caused as much surprise as the undergarment she wore beneath . Wearing it she no longer looked the young girl but the woman full grown . Indeed , her eighteenth birthday the following 14  | month would prove she was . But there was something else about the gown that made her seem strangely different . As the chemise , it barely concealed her bosom , and the lining gave the illusion she was without even that questionable undergarment . She looked the temptress , seductive , without innocence , a woman knowing her way among men instead of a maiden still untouched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she came from the bedroom . He had taken some time with his own appearance , changing his traveling garb for richer , more elegant clothes and curling short wisps of his thinning hair around his fat face , succeeding only in making it appear rounder . " My dear sweet Heather , your loveliness does make my heart wish for younger years . I have heard tales of such great beauty as yours , but never , never have I seen it with my own eyes . " Heather murmured a gracious comment before her attention slid to the food that had been brought . She sampled the tantalizing aromas that filled the air . The table had been set with crystal , china and silver and a feast lay on the sideboard . There she found roast game bird , wild rice , buttered shrimp , sweet pastries and candied fruits . A light wine was in a decanter conveniently placed at the head of the table . William , at the moment , filled his eyes with other pleasures as he allowed his appraising gaze to sweep over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His devouring stare remained momentarily upon the decolletage where the higher curves of her breasts swelled above the gown . His tongue passed over his thick lips as he surveyed those soft curves , impatiently anticipating the taste of that sweet , young flesh . He held a chair for her near the head of the table and smiled . " Sit here , dear lady , and let me wait upon you . " Heather complied and watched as he filled their plates . " Cook is a bashful sort , " he commented , dripping a generous portion of rice upon his plate . " She delivers my food promptly at my command then hurries away before I barely catch a glimpse of her . She whisks everything away again with the same silent efficiency and I 've hardly known she 's come . But as you will soon find out , she 's a most excellent chef de cuisine . " They began the meal , and Heather was amazed at the amount of food the man consumed . She found herself wondering if he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continually worked to chew his food and as he devoured the delicious partridge and sweet ( e ( 15  | tarts he licked his greasy fingers and almost incessantly smacked his lips . Several times he gave a loud belch , startling her . " When you begin at Lady Cabot 's , you 'll have great opportunities to meet some of the men from the wealthier class of people , and with your beauty it will not take you long to become the most sought after girl that ever entered that establishment . " He laughed , peering glassy-eyed at her over his goblet . " You are more than kind , sir , " she replied politely , though she thought the wine had made him a little daft . Few men visited ladies ' schools and those who did were usually well beyond marriageable age and had some business there . " Yes , " he grinned tipsily . " But I expect to be paid well for my efforts . " He looked at Heather hard now , but again she did not notice . watching instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He spilled some of the drink down his waistcoat and some dribbled down his chin when he took a deep sip . " You 'll find Lady Cabot 's quite a different place than you 've ever known before , " he slurred . " The madame and I are partners and we take care that only the comeliest maids live behind its doors . We must be very particular , for it 's frequented by the very rich and they do have such high standards . But with you I think there 's a fortune to be had . " Heather decided the poor man was too inebriated to know what he was rambling about . She stifled a yawn , feeling the effects of the wine herself , and longed to crawl into bed . William laughed . " I fear I 've exhausted you with my chatter , my dear . I had hoped you would not be too tired from our journey to permit us a long , friendly chat , but I see our conversation must continue tomorrow . " He put up a hand when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no arguments . You must go to bed . As a matter of fact , I 'm beginning to feel in need of that favored spot myself . It would please me greatly to know you 're reclining upon those soft downy pillows . " Heather more or less glided to her bedroom , the warmth of the wine relaxing every nerve , every limb . She heard William chuckling to himself as she closed the door behind her , and she leaned against it and laughed too , knowing all was changing in her life . She danced over to the mirror , feeling a little giddy , and bowed low before it . " Tell me , Lady Cabot , how do you like my attire ? If you view this with pleasure , you must see the gowns my aunt gave to me. "  | Laughing , she whirled and threw open the doors of the wardrobe to inspect the assortment of gowns within , deciding William would n't mind if she feasted her eyes on them . She had always enjoyed beautiful clothes and it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected a few gowns to admire further , took them to hold before her in front of the mirror , dreaming a little of owning such fine clothes . She did not hear the door open behind her , but as it was pushed wide she spun around with a start and saw William standing on the threshold , wearing a dressing gown . Doubt grew rapidly to sweep away her confidence . It dawned on her why he was there and it came as a great surprise , having associated him with Aunt Fanny and her rigid views of such matters . She stood staring at him , stunned , feeling the weight of the trap he had sprung upon her . She had fallen into it like a lamb for slaughter . His eyes burned bright in his ruddy face and a repulsive smile twisted his thick lips . He turned and locked the door behind him and leisurely held the key to tantalize her before he dropped it into his pocket . His gaze roamed over her and he seemed to enjoy the fear he saw in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathed . He leered . " I 've come to collect my due for taking you away from that dreary life in the country . You are such a tempting wench I could n't resist you . And you were so trusting it was easy to snatch you from my poor sister . When I tire of you I shall allow you to join Lady Cabot 's lovely group . You 'll not find boredom there . And in time perhaps I 'll even let you wed some rich soul who fancies you . " He came a step closer . " There 'll be no need for you to worry , child . Your husband will be a bit disappointed when he takes you to his bed , but he 'll not complain too loudly . " He moved forward and Heather backed fearfully against the table by the bed . " I plan to have you , my dear , " he said smugly . " So there is no reason why you should fight me . I 'm a very strong man . I do enjoy force if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer willingness . " She shook her head . " No , " she choked through her fright . " No ! You 'll never have me ! Never ! " William laughed in a terrifying way and Heather braced herself to flee . He was deeply flushed from the great amount of wine he had consumed and the fire raging through his veins . His raking gaze unclothed her and she pressed her hand to her bosom as if to ward off his penetrating gaze . She made to dart past him , but he was quick despite n I8thnolonie i , an it estuou ain Br lather thy Lo cmaid n her s to es ( g scho cape h al , her lent st and f towing side . 1 Nhodr pure .

His lips , wet and sticky with wine , sank to her throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She struggled with him , but her strength was no match for his . As his lips traveled upward she strained her face from him and tried to kick out , but his weight increased , pinning her legs against the table . She was held in an iron grip that left her breathless , and she wondered if her ribs could stand the pressure without cracking . In a panic she remembered the candelabrum on the table behind her and reached for it to protect herself with . She almost had it within her grasp but she was too hasty and it fell to the floor . Then her hand brushed the knife and she clutched at it in desperation . William was intent on spreading his hot , moist kisses over her throat and bosom , paying little heed to what she did until he felt something sharp press against his side . Glancing down he saw the knife and with a startled oath snatched at her arm . She winced in pain as his fingers closed cruelly about her wrist , yet she held on in blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl should dare threaten his body . Heather fought back with all the strength she could muster . His obesity forced her backward until it felt as if her back would break . Her hand grew numb and she knew she must soon yield the blade to him . Pressing his weight against her , William freed his other hand and , reaching across , twisted the small knife from her . Fearing the worst , Heather ceased her struggle and fell to the floor at his feet ; deprived of her support , less than agile William Court staggered forward and fell headlong upon the polished planks . He gave a growl with the impact . Heather had risen and stood poised to flee when William slowly rolled over . The small hilt of the fruit knife protruded from a slowly blooming spot of red on the shoulder of his gown . " Pull . . . it out . . . " he gasped . She bent and put a cautious hand to the knife but shuddered and recoiled from him , twisting her hands against her mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Help me . " She sank her teeth into her hand in panic and looked wildly about the room . He groaned , louder now ; confusion shook her every fiber and fear and hatred raged within her body . If he were dying . . . " Heather , help me . . .. " His voice trailed off and his chin quivered as if with the effort of drawing another breath . 18  | From some inner source , strength welled forth and calm returned . She leaned forward and drawing a ragged breath , took the knife with greater determination . Now she braced her other hand against his chest and pulled . The blade resisted a moment then slowly came out with a grating feel to it . Blood welled forth and with a gasp William fell back unconscious . Heather snatched a towel from the table , opened his robe and pressed it to the wound . Absently she laid her hand upon his chest and could detect no movement . Now she searched for some sign of life in earnest . Holding her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laying her ear to him she could hear no beat of his heart . Her own began pounding in her ears . She felt panic rise again and now could find no reason nor strength to battle it . " Dear Lord , what have I done ? " she murmured . " I must get help ! " The thought flared across her mind . But who would believe her , a stranger in this city now ? Newgate was crowded with women who claimed men had tried to assault them  --  and the block got its share too . They 'd not believe it was just an accident ! In her mind she held a picture of a stern judge in a long wig sneering down from his high bench , and then the face beneath the white hair became that of Aunt Fanny , sternly pronouncing sentence . .. and at sunrise the next day following shall be taken to Newgate Square and there . . . " Her mind would go no further , yet the echo of the stentorian voice fanned the flames of terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had she not been kneeling she would have fallen . Her head slumped and for a long time she sat not even thinking , then at last she looked up and a thought came to her . " I must get away from here . " It was as simple as that . She must escape . She must n't be here when they found William 's body . She must flee . Still gripped in panic , she forced herself to search his pockets for the key . She trembled , but it had to be done . Her own fear now fed her strength . She wrapped her own clothes in a scarf she found and clutching it to her , hurried to the door . She paused there for a moment without opening it , picturing the scene behind her . Again fear gripped her . She flung open the door and began to run as fast as her legs could carry her , through the parlor , the hall doorway , down the stairs , and toward the curtained doorway to the shop . As she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panic increased . Someone was there behind the curtain . Her already fast pace was quickened by sheer terror . Someone 19  | was after her . She ran swiftly , not daring to turn , her heart pounding hard in her bosom . She tore down the street , fearful of glancing back . She had no idea where she was going . Perhaps if she lost herself she could lose whoever was behind her . But why could n't she hear anyone running after her ? Was her own heart beating so loudly in her ears that she could hear nothing else ? Through the streets of London she raced , past shops of business , past great houses that loomed large and menacing in the darkness , past houses of lesser importance . She did not pay any attention to the people who stopped and stared after her . Soon she was exhausted , and in spite of her fear she stopped to lean against a rough-hewn stone wall . Her lungs burned with the effort of each breath she sobbed . Gradually she became aware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the waterfront . She raised her head and opened her eyes . Dense fog lay close upon the cobblestone street and the darkness pressed in until she could hardly breathe . A torch burned on a distant corner and she sought its light and could not bring herself to leave the small circle and go again into the dense black-grey night that surrounded her . Had she the courage , she knew not which way to flee . There was no hint of direction . She could hear the slow lap of water against the pier and the measured creaking of masts and an occasional muffled voice , but the sounds came to her from all around and she could see no spark of light anywhere . " There she be , by Jove ! That 's the one ! That 's her ! Come on , George . Let 's get her . " Heather started and whirled about and saw what appeared to be two seamen coming toward her . They knew about her and were coming for her . They were the ones who had been following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hint . Her legs could not move . She could not flee . She had to wait there for them to take her . " Hello , miss , " the older one said and smiled at his companion . " ' T is sure the cap'n will like ' er , eh Dickie ? " The other one passed his tongue over his lips and lowered his gaze to Heather 's bosom . " Aye . This one will suit him fine . " Heather trembled under the scrutiny of the men , but from the present time on she knew she would have no liberties . The only thing left her was to be brave . " Where are you taking me ? " she managed . Dickie laughed and punched the other in the ribs . " Kind o ' recep-  | five , ai n't she ? He 'll like her all right . Makes me wish I was him an ' could afford such . " " Just a little ways , miss , " the older one replied . " On board the merchant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man and the younger fell in behind , giving her no chance to escape . She wondered why they must take her on board a ship . There must be a portreeve there . It did n't matter . Her life was nothing now . Meekly she climbed the gangplank after the fellow and received his hand as he helped her down from it . He led the way across the deck to a door which he opened and she was ushered through a short companionway and after a light knock , through the door at its end . As they entered the captain 's cabin , a man rose from the desk where he had been sitting and had it not been for her bruised state of mind , Heather would have noticed his tall , muscular build and piercing green eyes . Fawn colored breeches were fitted snug about his narrow hips and a white ruffled shirt , opened to the waist , revealed a chest wide and firmly muscled beneath a mat of crisp black hair . He had the look of a pirate about him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair and long sideburns that accentuated the lean , handsome features of his face . His nose was thin and straight except for a slight hook in its profile just below the bridge . His hair was raven black and his skin darkly tanned . White teeth flashed in contrast as he smiled and came forward , sweeping her with a bold gaze from top to toe . " Aye , you 've done a handsome night 's work with this one , George . You must have searched hard and wide for her . " " Nay , cap'n , " the old man returned . " We found her walking the streets of the waterfront . She came most willingly , cap'n . " The man nodded and walked slowly , deliberately , completely around Heather as she stood rooted to the floor , not touching her with anything but those emerald eyes and they were enough , boldly , rudely evaluating every angle of her visible assets . A coldness grew deep inside her and she clutched her small bundle to her bosom . She felt naked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black that would cover her from neck to wrist to toe . He paused before her for a moment , smiling , but her eyes would not meet his . She kept them cast downward and stood humbly awaiting some indication of her fate . Behind her the two men grinned , extremely pleased with themselves . The tall man moved aside with them and the fellow , George , spoke in a low voice . Heather 's eyes moved about the cabin but saw nothing . Outwardly she appeared calm , but the emotional strains raging within  | her further sapped her strength . She was exhausted , bone tired , confused . She found it difficult to reconcile a magistrate of the law on board a ship , but knowing little of the processes of justice , reasoned that she was probably to be sent to some penal colony , for in her own mind she was guilty of murder . " Oh God , " she thought , " that I should be raised from a sty by the temptation of a life of ease and for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 've been caught and I must now accept whatever fate decrees for me . " Her mind stopped and held and was trapped by these final facts . She was guilty . She was caught . Justice had done with her and she had no further word . She did not hear the door close behind her as the seamen left , but words from the man who stood before her roused her from her thoughts . He laughed gently and made a sweeping bow . " Welcome back , m'lady , and I repeat , what is your name . " " Heather , " she murmured softly . " Heather Simmons , sir . " " Ah , " he sighed . " A small , tempting flower from the moors . It 's a most lovely and fitting name , m'lady . Brandon Birmingham is my name . Most of my friends call me Bran . Have you dined this eve-ning ? " She made a small nod . " Then perhaps some wine  --  a very fine Madeira , " he commented , lifting one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head slowly , dropping her gaze to the floor . He laughed softly and came forward to stand close before her . He took the bundle she clutched and tossed it in a nearby chair as he stared down at her , dazzled by her youthful beauty and the gown that seemed only a sparkling veil over her body . Her ivory skin glowed softly in the candlelight , and by the golden flames he saw before him a small woman , gracefully slender with breasts full and round , generously and temptingly swelling above her gown . They rose and fell slowly with her breath . He moved closer and in a rapid movement slipped his arm about her narrow waist , nearly lifting her from the floor , and then covered her mouth with his , engulfing Heather in a heady scent , not unlike that of a brandy her father had been fond of . She was too surprised to resist and hung limp in his embrace . She saw herself as if from outside her body and felt with mild amusement his tongue parting her lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there grew a vague feeling of pleasure and , had the circumstances been different , she might have enjoyed the hard , masculine feel of his body against hers . 22  | He stepped back , still smiling , but with a new fire kindled in his eyes . As he took his hands from her she gasped in stunned surprise for her gown fell in a heap about her ankles . She stared at him for a split  | second before she hurriedly bent to retrieve the garment , but those hands caught her shoulders and straightened her and she was again enfolded in his arms . This time she fought , for with sudden clarity it dawned on her just what he had in mind . She realized her disadvantage as her exhausted body struggled weakly against him . If William Court 's grip had been of iron , this man 's entire being was of finelytempered steel . She could not free herself and her hands pushed in vain against his chest . Her struggles pulled his shirt loose and then his furred chest lay bare against her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was left breathless each time his mouth took hers and passionate kisses seemed to cover her face and bosom . She felt his hands go up her back and with an easy tug he separated the shift and snatched it from her . Her naked breasts were crushed against his chest and in fearful panic she pushed hard and for a moment was free of him . He gave a deep throaty laugh and used the interlude to rid himself of boots and shirt and as he shed his breeches he grinned . " A game well played , m'lady , but have no doubts as to the winner . " His eyes burned with passion 's fire as he stood enjoying her now unbridled charms , far lovelier than he had imagined or even hoped , and she stared in horror at her first sight of a naked man . She stood fixed to the floor until he stepped forward and with a frightened squeak she turned to flee but found her arm seized in a grip that was gentle yet as unyielding as a band of steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his wrist . He grunted in pain and she jerked away , but in her haste she stumbled and fell full length into his bunk . Almost immediately he was on top of her , pinning down her writhing body , and it seemed that every move she made only abetted his intent . Her hair came loose and seemed to stifle her in its mass . " No ! " she gasped . " Leave me alone ! Let me be ! " He chuckled and murmured against her throat . " Oh no , my bloodthirsty little wench . Oh no , not now . " Then he moved upward and she was relieved of his heavy weight , but only briefly . She felt his hardness searching , probing between her thighs , then finding and entering that first tiny bit . In her panic to escape she surged upward . A half gasp , half shriek escaped her and a burning pain seemed to spread through her loins . Brandon started back in astonishment and stared down at her . She lay limp against the pillows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He touched her 23  | cheek tenderly and murmured something low and inaudible , but she had her eyes closed and would n't look at him . He moved against her gently , kissing her hair and brow and caressing her body with his hands . She lay unresponsive , yet his long starved passions grew and soon he thrust deep within her , no longer able to contain himself . It seemed with each movement now she would be split asunder and tears came to her eyes . The storm at its end , a long quiet moment slipped past as he relaxed against her , once more gentle . But when he finally withdrew , she turned to the wall and lay softly sobbing with the corner of the blanket pulled over her head and her now used body left bare to his gaze . Brandon Birmingham rose in bewilderment and for a moment stared at the flecks of blood that stained the sheet on his bunk . His eyes coursed slowly over Heather 's figure , now turned away from him . He could not but admire the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment past , been his . He almost reached out to caress the gently curving back , but his mind was confused by the turn of events ? her calm , reserved acceptance of the situation when she first entered the cabin , her light and playful resistance , and then the sporadic , inexperienced assistance she had given him in bed and now this endless weeping and the blood on the sheet . Was she some girl compelled to take up this occupation by poverty ? Her clothes and manner did not bear this out , yet her hands , though slender and white , were not soft as a lady of leisure 's might be . He shook his head and shrugged into his robe and went to pour himself a healthy glass of brandy . He took a long drink and stared pensively out the windows from which he had viewed much of the world . He was a foreigner to this land which his parents had once called home . It had ceased to be theirs shortly after their marriage when his father , an aristocrat but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . Now they were both ten years dead , his mother of a swamp fever , his father only a few months later of a broken neck suffered when thrown from one of those wild horses he loved so much . They left behind them two sons and a goodly fortune ? a plantation home and land to the eldest , being himself , and to their younger , Jeff , a share of the money and a prosperous warehouse in Charleston , a city which they had loved and called home as he did now . Born to these parents , a father who had been many times stubborn and more than willful , and a mother whose quiet , serene gentility had been the backbone of the family , he , Brandon Birmingham , had known a rigorous , adventurous life . His schooling had always come 24  | first but as a young lad , and at his father 's insistence , he had hired on as cabin boy to a salty old sea captain . He had learned the ways of the sea , ships , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position in that occupation when he had found it useful . But not all his time had been spent sailing the seas . Before that , he had been taught the workings of the plantation , from soil to market , and had never ceased this pleasant toil through his years of growing up . That was his main interest now , at the age of five and thirty  --  to settle down upon that land for good and enjoy the everyday world of it . Before leaving Charleston he had made a decision that this would be his last voyage . With France as unsettled as she was , it might prove unprofitable to continue . So he would take upon himself the responsibilities of a plantation and begin raising a family . He would be content ? he hoped . He smiled thoughtfully to himself . Strange how fondness for a land could make a man do things which did n't sit well within his mind . He was marrying Louisa Wells , although he did n't love her and knew her morals were not those of a genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land she possessed that had once belonged to the Birmingham family . His father had been granted the land that now made up the Wells and Birmingham estates from King George , and to begin building his plantation he had sold a small portion to that family . Brandon 's father had severed ties with Britain years before the war , and because of his service as an officer in that struggle against the crown had been able to keep his estates . Now , since Louisa had been left alone by the death of her parents a few years back , her land was being neglected and misused . Louisa was badly in debt . She had spent the fortune her father had left her and had sold all but a few of her slaves to keep up her high standard of living which had become only a front now . The merchants in Charleston had long ago refused her credit . So she was quite pleased with herself at having caught one of the city 's richest , most eligible bachelors . But she had caught him , knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relieve her of it for a goodly sum , which she had needed badly , but she had refused and played her woman 's part to the hilt . She acted the virgin when she enticed him to her bed , but he was not that kind of fool , and there was much gossip about this woman he and his younger brother had grown up with . Her experience in bed did prove entertaining , however , and he was not too displeased . A frown wrinkled his brow . It seemed odd to come from a family where jealousy and possessiveness for one 's mate were but a matter of 25  | fact and he , looking so much like the father who had possessed those traits , was not even jealous of the men who had shared his fiancee 's bed . Was he too cold and unfeeling to love or be possessive about the woman he was to wed ? It was n't even comforting to know that he cared more for her than he had for any woman in his lifetime . But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twinge of jealousy when she looked at another man , he would feel different now , at least a little more hopeful of learning to love her . But since he had known her all of her life , some thirty-two years of it , he was skeptical of any radical changes after their marriage . Jeff had declared him insane at the news of their engagement . Well , perhaps he was , but he had a mind of his own and if he had n't inherited his father 's jealous moods , he had inherited his stubbornness . His father 's determination and willful disposition had always been his . Even when his parents had died , leaving him with a prosperous plantation and the wealth to back it , he had not sat back and reaped the harvest . Instead , he had asked Jeff to take charge of the plantation and had bought this merchant ship and begun to sail the seas , bringing even more wealth to himself and his brother . He looked across to his bunk , then moved closer to stand beside it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its stead , but it was not an untroubled slumber . It reminded him more of an exhausted one . He reached down and gently covered Heather 's lovely body and pushed back the blanket from her head . The last thing he had expected to walk through his cabin door this night was a virgin . Knowing they were a troublesome lot , he had made it a habit throughout his life to avoid them , playing his leisure time upon those well versed creatures of gay , carefree living , in and out of bawdy houses , expensive and otherwise . This night , his first night in port after a long voyage across the ocean , he had freed his men to seek their pleasures , keeping only his manservant , George , and Dickie on board . But the urge had already been strong within him and he had bade George find him some lively vixen for the night , with emphasis upon cleanliness and comeliness . No , he had not expected a virgin , and one so lovely , never . It was strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had marriage in mind , trying coyly to entice a man into that trap with their charms . How else had he managed so successfully to remain single through his years of manhood had he not known their ways and avoided them ? But now when his bachelorhood was about to end and a marriage to begin to a woman well known by KAI 26  | other men , he had had this fresh young thing for his pleasure and her reasons were still a mystery . He slowly shook his head , then leaving his robe on a chair , doused the candles and stretched out beside her . The last thing he thought of before he dozed off was the gentle fragrance of her perfume and the warmth of her close beside him . The first faint streaks of dawn had breeched the eastern sky when Heather roused and then came fully awake , aware of her surroundings . She stirred and sought to move her head but found her hair caught beneath Brandon 's arm where it was bent under his dark head . His other arm was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hers . Cautiously she tried to ease herself from beneath his weight but succeeded only in awakening him . Before he was fully roused , she lay back and fearfully closed her eyes and breathed deeply as if in slumber . Brandon opened his eyes and quietly studied the face beside his own , taking great pleasure in its fine beauty . Long , sooty black lashes lay on skin , fair and flawless , and fragile eyelids hid from his view eyes that were clear and deep and the color of sapphires . He remembered them well . They had a most captivating slant , as did the soft brows that were like straight , upward slashes across her face . Her mouth was gently curved , pink and temptingly soft , her nose straight and delicately boned . Louisa would turn green with envy if the two ever chanced to meet , which was highly improbable . He smiled at the thought . His fiancee was quite proud of her own good looks and would not like to take second place to this slight nymph . Some people had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though there were many beauties there . He had n't thought of it much , but he supposed it could be true . Louisa 's golden hair and warm brown eyes were quite easy to look upon and her tall , buxom figure pleasant to ride . Still , this Heather here , in her soft and delicate beauty , would leave no doubt in the city as to who was the fairest . He leaned closer to kiss her ear and lightly nibble at its lobe . At his touch and before Heather could think , her eyes flew open . " Good morning , love , " he whispered softly and rose above her to kiss her lips . She lay perfectly still , fearing any movement might stir his passions . He needed no stirring . The fires in his loins were already burning high and growing hotter with each passing moment . His kisses passed from her lips , over her eyes , down her throat and paused at her shoulder 27  | where his teeth made tiny nibbles , sending shivers down her spine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pink crest of her breast and lightly teased it with his tongue . " Do n't ! " she gasped . " Do n't do that ! " He raised his heated gaze , smiling . " You 'll have to get used to my caresses , ma petite . " She withdrew from those amused eyes and fought to turn away , pleading with him . " No . Please , no . Not again . Do n't hurt me again . Just let me go . " " I wo n't hurt you this time , sweet , " he breathed against her ear , pressing soft kisses to it . The weight of his body held her on her back in the bunk and now Heather began to fight in earnest . She held her knees tightly together while she sought to scratch or claw him anywhere she could , but always a hand or elbow was there to stem her effort . He laughed as if enjoying her struggles . " You show considerably more spirit this morning , m'lady . " Then her arms were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held there easily in one of his hands . His other hand cupped a breast and he played with it to his pleasure while she twisted and fought against his overpowering strength . His knee slowly forced open her thighs and spread them and again she felt his manhood deep within her . There were no tears this time , but a hatred and a fear began to build apace in her mind . When he rolled from her she scurried from him and cowered in the corner of the bunk , her eyes wide and filled with the hurt and fear of a wounded fawn . He watched her with a puzzled frown furrowing his brow and sat up close beside her . He reached out to caress her cheek , feeling the need to comfort her , but she cringed from his hand as if it were a red hot iron and he realized with some surprise that it was he who frightened her . His frown deepened and his fingers slid through her hair , gently combing the silken strands that seemed now only a wild mass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heather , " he murmured gently . " You could have gotten a king 's ransom for what you lost to me a few hours ago and yet you were wandering the streets like any ordinary strumpet and , so I hear , you came willingly , without even trying to bargain for your worth , nor did you last night even hint that you were still intact , a virgin , or try to set a price with me . The gown you wore is costly , valued at more than some creatures of the streets might make in a year , though you , I guarantee , are of a different status  | entirely  --  so different I ca n't even imagine why you peddled your virginity as you did , taking the chance that you might have been raped and lost it for nothing . " Heather stared at him speechless , unable to fully comprehend the impact of his words . " You seem gently born and not the type to be wandering the streets or engaging in this profession . Your beauty is uncommon , few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet , " he murmured , taking one of her hands into his and turning it over , " your hands show the effects of toil . " He lightly ran a finger over her palm then pressed a kiss into it . Still gazing at it , he spoke again softly . " When you arrived last night you were calm and reserved , but just " a moment ago you fought me tooth and nail and would not permit me to be gentle . " As he spoke her mind flew . He was not the law ? Good God , what price had she paid for her fear and panic ? It would have been better if she had stayed and faced the regency 's men than to be here , deflowered and shamed to her very bone , or better yet to have remained where she was than to have sought the city at all . " But you need have no fear , Heather . I 'll provide well for you and you 'll live in comfort . I just arrived yesterday from the Carolinas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll stay with me while I 'm here . I 'll see that you 're established in a house of your own before I . . . " He was interrupted by a shriek of high , shrill , hysterical laughter , as Heather yielded to the shock of the situation . It dwindled gradually into sobs as tears streamed down her face . Her head dropped forward and her hair tumbled over her shoulders to mask her body . Tears fell on her hands folded in her lap as sobs jerked her tiny frame . Finally she threw her head back and looked at him with reddened eyes . " I was n't peddling my wares in the streets , " she choked . " I was simply lost and could n't find my way . " He stared at her a long moment in stunned silence before he frowned in confusion . " But you came with my men . " She shook her head in agony . He did n't know . He did n't know about her at all . He was just a seaman from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vowing he must never know of her greater sin . " I thought they were sent after me . I became separated from my cousin and lost my way . I thought your men were from my cousin 's . " Her head fell back against the wall and tears made wet paths down her face and plunged to her naked bosom which quivered with her silent crying . He watched those pale round breasts and his frown deepened as he wondered what repercussions there would be for this  | deed . Perhaps she was kin to some high official . He could almost feel the cold steel of the ax biting into his neck . He rose from the bed and stood by its edge , his back turned to her . " Who are your parents ? " he asked hoarsely . " Someone as beautiful and well bred as you must have many friends at court or come from a very influential family . " Her head rolled wearily back and forth against the wall . " My parents are dead and I 've never been to court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor . He picked it up and turned to her holding it . " You must have wealth . This gown cost no few pence . " She looked at him and laughed , a bit amused . " I 'm without a farthing , sir . My cousin gave me the gown . I work for my mere existence . " He looked down at the sparkling beads on the gown . " Wo n't this cousin be worried about you and be out trying to find you ? " Heather grew silent as her eyes dropped to her nakedness . " No , " she murmured . " I doubt that now . My cousin is n't one to worry long over the matter . " Brandon smiled in relief and draped the gown over the back of a chair . He walked to the washstand where he began to wash . He turned a few moments later to watch the girl rise from his bunk , and his eyes moved over her body slowly , taking in every detail of her alluring curves . She felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her womanhood from him , and he laughed softly and turned back to the mirror and prepared to shave while she hurriedly sought her old chemise from her bundle . " There 's no reason then , Heather , why you ca n't stay with me and be my mistress . I 'll find you a house in town where you may live in comfort and where I may take my leisure . I 'll furnish you with a goodly sum so you will not have to seek out other men nor would I allow you to do that . There 'll be times in the future when I 'll want to return and will need feminine companionship while I 'm here . I 'd like to think that matter is taken care of . " For a moment Heather was almost overcome by her hatred of the man . The emotion was beyond anything she had ever felt for anyone before . His casual attitude toward her and the whole affair infuriated her so much she wanted to shriek in rage and fling herself upon him and claw his handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she saw , now that he had his back to her and the door , her chance to escape . Wearing nothing more than her shift , she bit into her lip to  | keep it from quivering and eased her gown from the chair . She clutched her bundle to her . She stepped toward the door cautiously , her heart in her throat , and took another step . " Heather ! " he said sharply , startling her and sending all hopes of escape fleeing . She turned fearfully and found his fierce green eyes upon her as he casually stropped his razor , and she knew terror ? horrible , soul-shaking terror . " Do you think I 'm going to let you sneak away from me ? You 're too unique to find a replacement for and I have no intentions of letting you slip through my fingers . " The deadly calm in his deep voice was more frightening than Aunt Fanny 's violent shrieks had ever been . She trembled before him as the color drained from her face . He picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the noise the leather made as he sharpened his razor . Her eyes grew round and she cringed fearfully away . A small , satanic smile curved his lips and he snapped his fingers and pointed to the bunk . " Now get back in that . " She was well conditioned to taking orders and she did so now , terrified of what he might do if she did n't . Still clutching her bundle and gown , she sat down on the bunk and stared up at him as if she expected to be flogged . He dropped the strop on the table and wiping his face on a towel , came to the bunk and stood for a moment looking down at her . Then he threw the towel in a chair and took the things from her . He pointed to her shift . " Get that off . " Heather swallowed hard . Her eyes flew down his body and widened even more . She was fast losing her innocence . " Please ? " she gasped . " I 'm not a patient man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very menacing . Her fingers shook as she untied the ribbons and unfastened the tiny buttons between her breasts . She caught the hem and raised it over her head . Her eyes lifted shamefully to his as she felt his fiery gaze upon her body . " Now lie down , " he directed . She slid down into the bunk and her whole being quaked with fear of him and of what was to come . She tried to cover herself with her hands , feeling the awful humiliation of being naked and a coward . " Do n't , " he said and slid in beside her and drew her quaking limbs to his . 31  | " Please , " she whimpered . " Are n't you satisfied that you 've taken the one thing that was only mine to give . Must you keep torturing me again and again ? " " You might as well accept your lot as a paramour , my sweet , and become aware of the finer arts of the profession . The first thing I 'm going to show you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You fought me twice now and the last time caused your own misery . This time you will relax and let me do as I want without a struggle and though you may not enjoy it yet , you 'll see what I say is true . " " No ! No ! " she cried , trying to struggle free , but he clamped his hand tightly on her waist . " Be still . " Again he commanded , again she obeyed . She hated him but her fear was greater by far . She trembled violently with it . " Is this the way you treat your wife ? " she asked miserably . He smiled and bent over her lips . " I 'm not married , sweet . " She had no more to say when his kiss ended but lay tense and waiting . He made no move to mount her . Instead he played gently with her , caressing , softly titillating , cupping her breasts and pressing kisses over her body . " Relax , " he murmured against her throat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later you can learn what pleases a man , but for now just lie still . " Her mind tumbled over itself in its frenzy and no words sought her tongue . As she lay and submitted to his pawing , her life passed before her as if she were dying , and she wondered what great evil she had clone that the past years should have abused her so cruelly . Yet even Aunt Fanny 's endless heckling would be better than having to lie here under this man 's hands while he pleasured himself with her . Trapped ! ( ' aught ! Like a bird in a snare and now , plump and roasted , she must wait on the platter while he whetted his knife for the carving . And when the feast was done , what then ? The same table ? The same dinner ? Again and again ? Surely no simple-minded fowl ever suffered its fate but once . Her thighs were parted and she could not suppress a gasp as he drove home . " Easy , sweet , " he breathed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was nothing to do now but let him have his way . When he lay finished above her , he whispered against her hair . " Any more bruises , m'lady ? " 32  | She kept her eyes shut and turned her head aside . She loathed the very thought of him . He moved against her , urging her answer . " Did I hurt you this time ? " " No , " she choked out . He laughed softly and freeing her from his embrace , sat on the berth beside her and drew the sheet over her . " You do n't appear to be a cold wench , ma petite , " he said , running his hand over the curve of her thigh and waist , " only for the moment a reluctant one . Soon you 'll learn to enjoy it . For now just learn to accept it . " " Never ! " she half sobbed . " I hate you ! I loathe you ! I despise you ! Not in a million years ! " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up . " Someday you 'll be begging for it . " She turned in a huff , presenting her back to him and jerked the sheet over her shoulder . He chuckled again and reaching down , caressed her buttock . " Just wait , Heather , and we 'll see which one of us is right . " Anger shook her . He was so confident of himself , of her , of the future . He had it all neatly planned . And what did she have to say in the matter ? All she could do was beg for mercy and that would fall on deaf ears . But given the opportunity she would escape . She smiled to herself , thinking of that , and her spirits rose if only slightly . Her chance would come sooner or later and she would not hesitate to take it . The mere thought of escape soothed her frayed nerves and she relaxed into the pillows , listening to Brandon move about the cabin behind her . Her eyelids grew heavy and sleep pushed aside even those more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes without moving . The room was still and quiet and she thought herself alone at last , but when she rolled on her back she saw Brandon at his desk with quill in hand , reading over his ledgers . He was dressed and seemed for the moment to have forgotten her , engrossed in his work as he was . She might have been some stick of furniture for as much attention as he paid her . She watched him quietly . There was no denying that he was handsome , physically magnificent . She might have even dreamed once of such a man . But never in those innocent dreams of romance did she imagine that her love would fly to her on the wings of violence , or that she would be kept against her will to fulfill base desires . " Are you feeling better ? " he asked , looking up to find her eyes on 33  | him . He smiled and rose from the desk . " I hope you 're hungry . I waited to breakfast with you . " She sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet over her bosom , and her hair fell in soft disarray over her shoulders . " I want to get dressed , " she murmured , watching him cautiously as he came forward to lean against a timber above the bunk . He smiled warmly . " If you must , my love . " His eyes went over her . " Do you want any help ? " Heather almost climbed the wall to escape from him . " Do n't you touch me ! " she cried . " Ah-h , I see my little kitten has her claws bared . " He looked deep into her eyes . " Shall I make you purr , my sweet ? " " I 'll scream , " she whimpered . " So help me I will . " His white teeth flashed as he reached out and took her by the wrists and pulled her to him . His eyes held hers prisoner . " Do you think that would do you any good ? " he asked , as if amused . " Unless called for , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides , my dear , I can stop your screams quite easily with my kisses . " She shrank from him and a shudder of revulsion passed through her as his gaze went down her body , but he only laughed . Catching her around the waist , he swung her to her feet . " You 're very tempting , m'lady , but it is n't time for your second lesson yet . My servant is waiting to serve us our meal . " He left her to open a locker by the bed , and drew out a man 's dressing gown which he handed to her . " It 's a trifle large , but it 's the best I can offer at the moment . " He smiled . " I 'll take you this afternoon to purchase some clothes . If you 're like most other women that should perk you up . " She quickly wrapped the robe around her and found herself lost in it . There was no doubt it was his and it was far too big for her . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , so she had to gather in a good foot of it to walk . A smile played lightly about Brandon 's lips and his eyes gleamed as he observed her . He helped her fold back the sleeves . " If it 's possible to be jealous of a simple garment , m'lady , then I am of this one , and if it had life I 'd warrant it would be aquiver now with its good fortune . " She glanced away nervously . " May I be allowed privacy to wash , sir ? " She clutched the robe tightly at her throat and whispered , " Please . " 34  | He made a sweeping bow and grinned . " Your slightest wish is my command , m'lady . There are matters concerning the cargo that need my attention anyway so you may have some time . " She eyed him covertly as he walked to the door and before he opened it he glanced back at her and grinned quite devilishly , then made his exit with a laugh . Heather released a small sigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water in the bowl . She scrubbed every inch of her body until her skin glowed a healthy pink . She longed for a steaming tub bath so that she could soak in it and remove from her body every trace and remembrance of him , of the fine mist of sweat that had moistened his body and then hers , the feel of his hands upon her , the memory of his smothering kisses . Everything . Every tiniest bit of evidence that she had been his . The cool water helped a little to revive her downtrodden spirits , and she donned her shabby shift and pink gown , feeling a trifle better . She raked her fingers through her hair , combing it as best she could in that manner , then returned his robe to the locker , noting as she did so the well chosen and obviously costly clothes within . It was irritating to think that she could n't secretly laugh at his choice of apparel . Her nerves stretched taut with her toilette complete , and needing some task to occupy her thoughts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was littered with clothing . His were thrown over the back of a chair , her beige gown in another . The torn chemise was still where he had dropped it after ripping it from her . She picked it up and found it irreparable . His hands destroy well , she mused . With renewed anger she marched to the bunk and began smoothing the sheets until her eyes fell on the blood that stained them , and she realized it was her blood , her proof of virginity . In a high rage , she jerked the sheets from the bed and threw them to the floor . Her eyes bright and her cheeks flushed , she whirled around at a soft laugh from behind her and faced Brandon who stood in the open doorway . He had returned silently and without her knowing . His eyes dropped from her angry face to the sheets behind her , then he raised his eyes again as he closed the door and leaned against it . He smiled at her mockingly , and with an infuriated groan , Heather turned her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her and she hated him . He was detestable . He came up close behind her , slipped his arms about her waist and drew her back against him . 35  | " Do you think you could have remained chaste for long with the face and body you have , my sweet ? " he murmured against her hair . " You were meant for love , and I am not saddened because I snatched you before other men tried you , nor do I feel guilty over the pleasure you 've given me . Pray do not blame me for being infatuated with your beauty and wanting you for my own . It would be a task for any man not to . You see , in truth , m'lady , I am your prisoner , caught in your spell . " She trembled as his searing lips pressed against her throat and beneath her breasts her heart thumped wildly . " Are you void of a conscience ? " she choked . " Does n't it matter that I do not wish to be here ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any desire to be . " " You do not wish it now , my love , but later you will . If I allowed you to go now I 'd never see you again because of what has passed between us . If we had met differently , I could have courted you gently and wooed you into my bed with tender words . But here we started backwards and frightened you and as a bird flees from its captor , so would you fly from me . To keep you I must show you that it is not so bad being my mistress . You 'll have everything your heart desires . " " I have heard tales of Yankees , " she said snidely , " but I never guessed that all those aspersions could be true until I met you . " He threw back his head and laughed heartily . " Spoken like a true Englishwoman , m'lady . " She jerked angrily away and faced him . " Just tell me why you want me ? " she demanded . She threw her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must suffer your affections when you can find many a maid more willing than I anywhere you should happen to look ! Would n't your romps in bed be more entertaining with a woman who appreciates your advances than with one who loathes the very sight of you ? " He chuckled at her anger . " You have a sharp tongue , m'lady . You wound me to the quick . But the reasons are quite simple . Take a look at yourself and you 'll see a very excellent one . You 're like a breath of fresh spring air after a night in an overcrowded tavern . " He took a seat at his desk , relaxing in the chair as he regarded her . " I find you very desirable , Heather , truly worth having  --  a jewel among pebbles . The challenge of winning you excites me . I 've never been denied before . " " You should have been , " she spat vindictively . " Perhaps then you would have learned to be a gentleman . " 36  | His eyes sparkled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when I want you badly enough I can overlook being a gentleman . " She turned her back on him in frustration . There was no talking to the pompous , arrogant scoundrel . He made his own rules to fit his own games . She could n't think of enough names to do justice to the way she felt about him . All she knew was that she 'd leave him and his miserable cabin if it were the last thing she ever did . A few moments later George entered the cabin , carrying a large tray laden with their morning meal . The servant smiled rather sheepishly at her as he placed the tray upon the table , but she glared at him and presented her back where in turn he looked to his captain , quite confused . A small smile curved Brandon 's lips and he nodded to the servant to continue with what he was doing . When the table lay set , Brandon held a chair out for her . " If you please , Heather , " he smiled mockingly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Now sit and be a good girl for a change . " George looked between the two , becoming more perplexed , and hurriedly poured coffee in the mugs . Heather grudgingly took her place and adjusted a napkin irritably over her lap . She sipped the coffee , though she preferred tea , then grimaced at its strong taste and pushed it away from her . Lifting her eyes , she found Brandon watching her with an amused smile . Nothing was said and she attacked her small steak of beef as if it needed yet to be slaughtered , though in truth it was quite tender . She found it strangely prepared , not boiled nor cut into tiny bits for a stew but simply cooked in its own juices and left still rare . She tried a small piece and found it tasty , but her appetite was far from hearty and she simply picked at it . George watched her for a moment in indecision , wishing to please but not knowing how . He turned finally to leave , and noticing the Nit lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His eyes widened as he saw the stains and he glanced quickly to his captain , who was watch- . ing him , then to Heather whose back was turned to him and once more to Brandon who met his look and nodded once to his unasked questions . The servant 's eyes widened even more and he hurriedly gathered the sheets in his arms and made a hasty exit . Brandon regarded Heather 's display of temper and casually sliced off a bite of steak . " I will not tolerate your spiteful mood at my table , Heather , " he 37  | said calmly , " nor your treating my man unkindly . In his presence you will be a lady . " Fear rose within Heather and every muscle in her body drained of strength , leaving her quivering in her chair . She grew pale and even her small desire for nourishment left her . She folded her hands in her lap and gazed down at them , unable to meet his stare . Brandon swallowed some of the hot coffee as he continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore . It was a garment a younger girl might wear and pretty though it was , he did n't care for its girlish lines . It made him feel uncomfortable , as if he had stolen a babe from its cradle . The only thing about it that found favor with him was the snug bodice which pressed her bosom upward , reassuring him that she was no child . But it was hardly the sort of gown he wanted his mistress to wear , and the frayed chemise he had seen on her earlier would have to go . She was too beautiful to wear rags . The meal at its end , he returned to his desk to work at his ledgers while Heather , not knowing what to do with herself , paced the floor or fidgeted at the window seat and felt like climbing the walls . He left the cabin for a time , long enough for her to gather courage to try the door , but her thought of escape was badly timed for she found him in the companionway giving orders to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he glanced up and smiled at her mockingly . When George came with the noon meal she was polite , but not to the point of being gracious . Silently she cursed the man . Brandon pushed his chair back from the table , a time later , his hunger for food satisfied , and Heather felt his eyes sweep her . A silence filled the room and she swallowed hard , keeping her gaze averted . She knew his affections had warmed again and her heart refused to slow to a regular beat . His voice when he spoke was low and rich with passion . " Come here , Heather . " She froze in the chair . She would not go to him . She would stay where she was . He could not bully her . She shook her head and managed to croak a weak , " No . " His eyelids lowered and he smiled slowly . " I admire your spirit , ma cherie , but do you think it wise to resist me ? You know as well as I that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I want . Would it not be better to acknowledge defeat and come will-ingly ? " Heather shook and terror could not be denied . Her courage failed her . Slowly she rose on trembling legs , her teeth tugging nervously at 38  | her bottom lip , and went to stand before him . He smiled at her leisurely and sliding his hand up her arm , pulled her between his legs and down upon his knee where she sat rigidly as he pressed his lips against her throat . " Do n't be afraid , " he breathed . " I wo n't hurt you . " His mouth moved over her shaking lips and parted them as his arms slid tightly around her , one hand settling on her back while the other sought her hip . With a half sob , Heather went limp against his chest , trembling violently within his grasp . His kisses went on it seemed to her without end . When his hand slid from her hip to her thigh and moved slowly upward along the inside , caressing it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the embrace could not be broken . His lips left hers to kiss the corners of her mouth , her chin , her ear . " Do n't fight me , " he murmured . " Let yourself enjoy it . " " I ca n't , " she choked . " Yes , you can . " His lips as they traveled from her throat to the rounded curves above her gown were moist , parted , drinking in the sweetness of her flesh . They caressed her breasts unhurriedly , moving from the deep valley between to the pointed peaks which rose up beneath her gown . His breath came more rapidly and touched her skin like a hot iron . Aroused , he unfastened her bodice and pressed passionate kisses on her naked flesh . From the cabin door came a hesitant knocking and a black scowl crossed Brandon 's face . Heather frantically clutched her garments together over her bosom in shame and tried to leave his knee when he loosened his hold upon her , but he tightened it again , forcing her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intruder , there was no doubt of his irritation . " Blast you , come in ! " George opened the door and stood red-faced as he looked across the cabin at them , shuffling his feet in embarrassment . " Beggin ' your pardon , cap'n , but a messenger 's come from a merchant who wants to speak with you about the cargo . His man says he 's interested in buying the whole lot of rice and indigo if the two o ' you can meet and agree . " " He wants me to go to him ? " Brandon asked , almost incredulously . " Why in hell 's name ca n't he come here to the Fleetwood as the others do ? " " The man 's crippled , so his messenger says , cap'n , " the servant 39  | replied . " If you 're willing , his man will look over the cargo to see its value and then take you to him . " Brandon muttered an oath and the scowl deepened . " Ask Mr. Boniface to give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man in here when he 's through . " It George skittered out , closing the door behind him and Brandon reluctantly turned Heather loose . She ran to the window seat and hurriedly fastened her clothes as he moved behind his desk and sat down . She felt his eyes on her and the color rose high to her cheeks . Some time later the messenger was admitted and she turned her back to the occupants of the room and sank to the cushions of the seat . That anyone should find her in Captain Birmingham 's cabin embarrassed her to the bone . Her face flaming with the shame of it , she wanted very much to die . Through the windows she watched the water lap against the sides of a merchantman docked nearby and mused how , if she but had the nerve , the water might put her problems to an end . She thought she might welcome its liquid fingers snuffing out her life . She leaned forward to gaze more intently at the dark swirling river , unaware that the messenger had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped a hand to her shoulder and she jumped with a start . He laughed softly and sank down beside her on the cushions and touched a curl over her breast . " I 'm afraid I must leave for a few hours , Heather , but I 'll return as soon as I 'm able . George has been instructed to keep an eye upon you so I beg you not to make it difficult for him . He 's a gentle soul where ladies are concerned despite what you may have thought last night . I have informed him that I want you here when I return , so do not try to get away . I 'll have his skin if you succeed and I 'd find you again if I had to tear down all of London . " " I do n't care in the least if you skin your man , " she replied heatedly . " But if the opportunity to escape presents itself , I 'll take it . " Brandon raised an eyebrow . " In that case , Heather , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , do n't ! " she cried . " Please . I beg of you . I would die of shame if you did . Oh , please do not . If you wish , I 'll read while you 're away . I swear . " Brandon studied her with a great deal of interest . " You can read ? " he asked . " Yes , " she returned softly . He smiled down at her . Not many women could read , and he felt a new respect for the girl . 40  | " Very well , " he said finally . " I will leave you here , and I 'll stop at a clothier 's on the way back so that you may look like a woman . Now stand up and let me judge your size . " Self-consciously , Heather complied and slowly turned around before him as he directed . His eyes moved over her appreciatively . " You 're hardly bigger than a mite . " " Some people say I 'm thin , " she commented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brandon laughed , " I can imagine the jealous old crones who said that . They were probably wallowing in their own fat . " A small smile broke across Heather 's features as he seemed to describe her aunt , and then it was gone , almost as quickly as it had come , but it did not go unnoticed . " Ah-h , " he grinned . " I knew I could make you do that sooner or later . " Heather turned away and lifted her nose high in the air . " Because of you , I have little to be happy about : " " Now it 's that again , is it ? " he chuckled . " Your moods are very changeable , m'lady . " He rose and came to stand behind her . " Now let us see if some of that ice has thawed from your lips . I wish to feel some warmth for a change . Come , kiss me as a mistress should . I 've not time for more . " Heather released a quivering sigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovemaking . She concluded a bit of effort on her part , as if yielding to his protestations , would do much to allay whatever fears or suspicions he might be harboring over leaving her . She turned and with a new determination , slid her arms behind his neck and pulled his head down to hers . His brows lifted as if he were considering this new change in her and Heather , not wanting him to dwell too long upon the matter , pressed moist , warm lips upon his and seizing upon her meager experience , kissed him long and in a loving fashion , arching her body against his . Brandon savored the honey taste of her lips and the intoxicating nearness of her body and all logical thinking fled his mind . His arms went around her and held her tightly as he enjoyed the unexpected warmth of her response . His body demanded he do more with her . She was too tempting , this slight wisp of a girl . Her lips were too warm , her body too desirable . It was becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't . With an effort he set her from him . 41  | " I will be hard put to go anywhere if you kiss me like that , " he said huskily . Heather 's face pinkened . The kiss had held some surprises for her , too , for she had not found it such a loathsome task . " And now I fear my departure will be delayed after all . These tight breeches leave nothing to the imagination , " he grinned . Her eyes traveled downward innocently to his pants . She was instantly sorry . Her face flooded with color and she jerked around with a moan , mortified . Brandon chuckled behind her and then with a pensive sigh , turned to the business of dressing , mumbling wistfully , " Had I but the time , madam ? " Seething , Heather began stacking dirty dishes at the table , thinking many ill thoughts of the man behind her . She decided he was more than detestable . Brandon was giving a last adjustment to his stock when Heather turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hatred she felt for him , she could not deny what a fine specimen of a man he was . His garments were immaculate and well chosen , in the height of fashion , and they fit his tall , broad shouldered frame superbly . His breeches were tailored so well they clung nearly as tightly as his skin . They did nothing to disguise the bulge of his manhood . " He 's so handsome he probably has to fight the women off , " she thought bitterly . He came forward and , in a casual but possessive and intimate manner , pressed a light kiss upon her lips and gave her buttock a fond pat . " I 'll be back soon , sweet , " he smiled . Heather could hardly hold her tongue , wanting to scream at him in rage . She watched him leave , all too confident of himself for her state of mind , and then heard the click of the lock on the door . With frustrated anger rising in her veins , she whipped her arm across the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time in her determination to flee the ship . If Captain Birmingham returned before she left , her opportunity would be greatly diminished . She tried to think of ways George could be tricked and wondered if he could be bribed with money ? But what would she use for that scarce item ? Her beige gown was the only thing of value she possessed and she pondered whether it would be sufficient temptation to bring him over to her side . Then she thought of the man who had used her body for his pleasure and her ideas of bribery died away . The servant would either be too loyal to that pompous cad of a sea captain or too afraid of him to endanger himself with any temptation of bribery . No , that would not do at all . She 'd have to think of something better . Many plans flickered through her mind , but none would take finite shape . She could not bribe him , so she would have to use force . But what could a mere girl do against a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stringy muscles could easily keep her detained for his captain . She began searching the cabin for anything that would help persuade the man to hand over the keys to the cabin door , jerking open the desk drawers , frantically searching through papers and books , even in Brandon 's sea chest . She found only a bag of coins . Wearily she sank into the chair behind the desk . Her eyes wandered about the cabin , hunting through each corner and shadow of the room . " He must have some weapon here , " she bit off , disgruntled because time was against her . Her eyes fell on the locker , and leaping from the chair , she dashed across the room and flung open its doors . She searched frantically through every garment hung within but again she found nothing . With a despairing sob , she began yanking the contents from the closet 43  | until her eyes fell on a box wrapped in cloth upon the floor of that tiny compartment . " Probably his jewels , " she thought testily as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protective cloth . She had no interest in his jewels , if that was what the box held , but the container itself interested her . Made of fine-grained leather , it was elaborately tooled and inlaid with gold with a large " B " dominating the top . It was n't a very deep or large box , but she was sure it held something of value . Curiosity began spreading within her , and she could n't stop her fingers from I opening the catch and lifting the lid . Heather gasped in surprise , and she gave a silent prayer of thanksgiving . There , lying in a bed of red velvet , were two of the most beautifully executed flintlocks of French design she had ever seen . She knew little of firearms , but her father had possessed one of this type , only not so finely made . Their butts were of smooth English oak , oiled to a rich luster and bound with heavy brass rings to blue steel barrels . The trigger guards and butt plates were of lightly worked brass , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ravages of time . She examined the pistols , failing to fathom their mechanisms . Her father had never shown her how . She knew the lock pulled back to cock it , yet how it was loaded was a complete mystery . Silently she damned her ignorance and closed the cover on those fine weapons , trying to think of some way to even her odds with George . She cast glances about for anything . Perhaps something to hit him over the head would do . But she realized as she searched that she probably could n't hope to more than daze him . Unless he was restrained in some fashion , she would n't have time to get away . Opening the box again , she took out one of the heavy pistols and examined it again . Would he know that she did n't have the slightest idea how to use the pistol ? Just as long as she pretended how , it might frighten him enough to hand over the key to the door . She began to take heart now and a smile broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , she took out pen and paper and began scratching out a note to Captain Birmingham . She would have need of money , but she would never allow herself to be accused of selling her body for it . She would take one pound from the bag of money she had found earlier and leave in its stead the beige gown . It was more than a fair trade . She folded the note and left it on top of the gown and then carefully hid one of the pistols beneath the pile of maps and papers where it 44  | would be easily accessible to her when George returned with the tea she had requested as he cleaned up the broken dishes from the floor . He had seemed anxious to please despite the mess and said there would only be a small delay while he sent a man to buy the leaves . It had worked perfectly , giving her time to search the cabin in his absence . Now she hid the monogrammed box in a desk drawer and straightened the cabin so the servant would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been searched . After doing this , she sat and read from a book she found on the desk . It was the least she could do , since she had promised . She would show Captain Birmingham she was not a person to be kept against her will . She laughed , anticipating the rage that would descend upon George , for whom she could feel nothing but hatred . After all , he had brought her to this disgrace . A fitting reward , she thought . Shakespeare 's Hamlet was not very quieting to her already frayed nerves . She began to feel apprehensive at the delay of George 's return and at times would put the book aside to pace the floor . After a few moments , she would snatch up the book again and force herself to read . When he finally did unlock the door and rap , she dropped the book and shot out of her seat in pure nervousness . She made herself sit again and calmly called admittance . He opened the door , stepped in and turned to lock it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I brought you the tea , miss . It 's good and ' ot . " He smiled and started to come forward to bring it to her . Now was her chance . She raised the pistol from the desk and pulled back the lock . " Do n't move , George , or I shall have to shoot , " she said . Her voice sounded strange to her ears . George glanced up from the tray and found the huge bore staring at him . He did n't think a gun in a woman 's hand was a laughing matter . They never realized the full danger of one . He turned a few shades paler . " Please drop the keys on the table , George , and do be careful , " she pleaded . She watched as he did so , leaning against the desk to ease her shaking limbs . " Now very carefully walk to the window seat , " she directed and did not take her eyes off him as he made his way hence . He moved slowly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . He knew when to be careful . When he stood in front of the window , Heather 's breath slipped from her in a long sigh . " Please sit , " she commanded , feeling a bit of confidence return . 45  | She moved to the table , picked up the keys , not taking her eyes from the old man facing her and backed to the door . Without turning , she felt for the lock and thrust the key in and turned it . The feeling of prison slid away with the latch . " Please , George , to the locker and inside . And do n't try anything for I 'm quite nervous and the pistol is really very delicate . " George dropped his idea of quick assault . It was true , she was nervous . She had trouble holding the gun steady in her hands and she had her lip tightly clenched between her teeth . She would shoot if he made a move to stop her , he concluded . He wondered if the pain of his captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the pistol the girl held in her hands . He knew the man 's anger could burn to great heights when provoked . He had been with him for a long time . He was fond of his captain and admired him ; he was also afraid of him at times . But he doubted if Captain Birmingham would kill him and he was sure the pistol could easily send him to his grave if he tried to take if from the frightened girl . He walked to the locker , stepped into the cramped space and pulled the door closed behind him . Heather had stood watching the servant , ready to run if he made a move toward her . She breathed a sigh of relief when he was safely closeted and crept to the door of the locker and pushed it closed until she heard a click . It had no latch on the inside so she would have time to get away before an alarm could be sounded . She went to the desk and opened the drawer where she had found the bag of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top of the desk . It did n't take her long to reach the door . It opened very quietly . No one was about in the companionway and she hurried to the door at its end . She had not thought about getting off the deck of the ship , and when she cracked the door a slit , her escape looked impossible . There were many people aboard , and she would not go without notice . These must be merchants inspecting the cargo , she presumed , for quite a few prosperous looking gentlemen wandered about . Closing the door , she rested her head against the cool wood of the ship , feeling despair . What would happen when she tried to leave the ship ? Only the captain and a couple of his men knew that she was aboard . What did these men here know of her ? Why not be brave for a change , she argued with herself . Just walk out in the midst of them . Fledgling hope returned . This time without hesitation she opened the door . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast . Forcing a smile , she passed into the crowd with an air of queenly 46  | grace . She held her head high , nodding it ever so slightly to the men who turned to gape at her . They grinned at her and brought her to the attention of their companions . A hushed quiet fell over the deck of the ship as the men followed her openly with admiring stares . They were interested , but none made a move to stop her . When she lifted her skirts a small degree , their eyes went to the pretty ankles and dainty small slender feet . A tall , middle-aged gentleman with dark skin , white hair and goatee offered his hand to her . She smiled sweetly at him and took it and as she walked away from him down the plank , felt his eyes upon her . Before she stepped off she turned and smiled again . He returned her smile and bowed gracefully , sweeping his hat before his chest . She knew she was flirting shamelessly but the thought that her departure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail warmed her with pleasure . She had outwitted him ! Many were waiting to help when she stepped off the ramp . They swarmed around to be the one who took her hand . She selected the most handsome , expensively dressed one among them and coyly placed her hand in his . She asked him sweetly if he would find her a carriage and was amazed when , with great abandon , he charged off in search of one . He was back shortly , questing if he might escort her to where she was going . She refused politely , and reluctantly he handed her into the waiting carriage . She thanked him graciously for his assistance . He asked where she lived , but she could not tell him , and it did him little good to insist . She remained polite but silent , and with a sigh he dropped her hand and closed the door . When the carriage started moving she smiled at him but shook her head when he apparently thought her smile was an encouragement and made to run after her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the seat and smiled . She felt hysterical laughter rise , so great was her relief . She relaxed and closed her eyes and some time later they pulled up at the coach house on the outskirts of London . She went immediately to reserve a seat on the coach that would take her back to her aunt 's . She had decided earlier she would go back . There was no other place to go . Aunt Fanny and Uncle John could n't possibly know what had happened to William for a long time , if ever . She doubted that any of William 's friends in London knew of a sister living on a small , dreary farm . It was hopeful thinking on her part , yet after seeing William living in such grandeur , she did n't believe he had made much mention of his sister . And she had to leave London while Captain 47  | Birmingham was still in port . Her uncle 's farm was the safest place for her to be . She would stay with her aunt just long enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent of the woman whose brother was dead because of her . It was hard to go back , but to remain in London was impossible . On the coach trip back , her mind was tortured by the events of the day before . She tried to quell the thoughts that plagued her . Still they persisted , haunting her ruthlessly . She tried to convince herself that none of it was her fault , but it did little to still the pain of all that had happened to her . She was not the same person of the day before , an innocent who had ridden to London dreaming of great things to come her way . She was a woman now , no longer ignorant of a man 's caresses , no longer a girl . She vowed with great determination this would not change her . Marriage now would only bring disgrace . But if she was to remain a spinster , she would at least be an independent one . Above all , she would not be dependent . Then later , employment would be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Fanny and Uncle John . She needed a reason for coming back . Not being on the best of terms with her kinsfolk , she could n't return and say she had missed them so much in a day 's time she found she could n't bear to live away from them . That would surely make her aunt suspicious . No , it had to be some believable lie . When the coach came to the village crossroads near her uncle 's farm , it stopped only long enough to allow Heather to get off . She descended without a glance behind and remembered nothing of her companions on the journey . She took the road leading eastward out of the village , the sun now making long shadows before her . Unconsciously , the nearer she got to the small farm , the slower her step became . When she finally arrived , the sky was pitch black and meal time was long passed . She walked slowly to the door and lightly rapped on it . " Uncle John , it 's Heather . May I come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the door was flung open . She had hoped to see her uncle first , but it was not to be so . Her aunt stood in the doorway , a look of surprise on her face . " What are you doing here ? " the woman questioned in astonishment . 48  | It was time to tell another lie , and it bothered Heather to think that just since the day before she had been reduced to lying about everything . " Your brother found when he returned to London that he had to journey to Liverpool and inspect some silks he wanted to buy . He did n't feel that it was appropriate for me to be in the city unchaperoned . " She almost choked on the words , for the lie tasted bitter in her mouth . " Well now , a bit disappointed you are , eh ? " Aunt Fanny smirked . " Going all that way to London expecting the whole world . Serves you right for being such a snooty little beggar . Always thinkin ' yourself a queen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thought you to be one . Now I 'm supposin ' you 're here to take up your chores again after you 've been away . " " If it pleases you , Aunt , " Heather replied meekly , knowing that life with the woman would be harder now . But anything would be better than what Captain Birmingham had had in mind for her . " It pleases me fine , missy , and you 're going to appreciate being home , you are , " Aunt Fanny sneered , meaning just the opposite . Heather understood but made no reply . She would accept the way the woman treated her without complaints . It was probably what she deserved for being so vain to think that a life of wealth in London was something she had been created for . The only thing for her to do now would be to humble herself and make amends . " Well , get to bed with you , for when morn comes you 'll have to be up and working . Your uncle is already to bed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , she was sure her aunt noticed it . The woman made no reference to it , and Heather knew she would not . She had eaten little that day with Captain Birmingham sitting across from her . Her mouth watered now as she remembered how tasty the food could have been if that fiend of a madman had n't been there . Without a word she moved to her corner and behind the curtain where she disrobed . The blanket was as rough as it had been before and it was likely to prove as incapable of keeping out the cold as it had in the past , unless  --  unless she could find a position of work elsewhere . It would mean she 'd have to go to the village and scan the town 's posted paper which usually advertised for young girls to fill occupations of maid , tutor and the like . It would n't be hard to find something , she was sure . Despite the hunger that gnawed at her stomach , she drifted into a 49  | dreamless sleep . Morning came for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her aunt tore back the curtain and threw the old hand-me-down dress into her sleeping face . The woman reached down and shook her with ruthless hands . " Get up , you lazy chit . You 'll be having to make up for the chores not done the two days you be gone . Get up with you now , " she snorted . Startled out of her slumber , Heather sat up in her cot , blinking the sleep from her eyes . Her aunt looked more like a witch than she remembered , alarming her . With trembling body she quickly jumped out of bed and pulled the old dress over her head under the watchful eyes of her aunt . She only had time to grab a piece of stale bread before Aunt Fanny sent her to fetch firewood . When she went out to get it , she found Uncle John preoccupied with his own thoughts and not even interested enough to speak to her . He was chopping the wood and when he saw her , he ducked his head over his work . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her and it hurt deeply . She wondered why he tried to ignore her . It was as if she possessed two heads and he wished not to look upon her . An uneasiness crept through her suddenly and made her begin to wonder if he suspected anything . But " how could he ? Through the day she grew certain something was troubling him . Though he never spoke to her , he watched her closely , as if he were trying to read her mind . Becoming uneasy under these stares , she would move out of his range of vision . She could not fathom what was bothering him , and she dared not ask . By bedtime she was completely exhausted and fell into her cot , too tired to move . Her thoughts were not so inactive however . She saw William Court 's prostrate form as clearly as if she were again standing at the door looking back at him . But that vision quickly faded when Captain Birmingham 's face loomed up above her in the darkness . She saw his mocking grin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She heard his amused laughter once again , and with a strangled cry , she rolled over and buried her face into the pillow to smother the sobs that shook her , remembering too well the feel of his hands upon her body . Morning dawned and she was up and working before her aunt stirred . She had vowed after those sleepless hours she spent in her cot that she would labor and toil until not one thought or memory re-50  | mained that could torment her . She would find the joy of sleep through extreme fatigue . When Aunt Fanny came from the other room , fastening her homespun dress over her enormous bosom , Heather was down on her knees cleaning cinders from the hearth . The woman came to the hob , snatched up an oatcake and frowned down at Heather . " You look a bit pale this morn , missy , " Aunt Fanny sneered . " Could it be you 're not happy with being here ? " Heather dumped the rest of the ashes into the wooden pail and stood up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was smudged across her cheek and the oversize dress she wore hung loosely from her slender shoulders , exposing much of one round breast where the neck opening had fallen . She wiped her hands on her skirt , leaving it smeared with soot . " I 'm satisfied with being here , " she murmured , glancing away . Aunt Fanny reached out and jerked Heather 's face around , her fat fingers bruising her niece 's tender flesh . " Your eyes are swollen . I thought I heard you cryin ' in your pillow last night , and I see I was right . You 're mournin ' cause you 're not in London , I 'm supposing . " " No , " Heather whispered . " I 'm content . " " You lie ! You hate it here ! You want to live in London in the grand manner you think is due you ! " Heather shook her head in denial . She did n't want to go back . Not yet anyway , not when Captain Birmingham was still there and likely carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He might be there for three or four months yet , getting rid of his cargo and buying more . She could n't go back . Aunt Fanny pinched her viciously on the arm . " Do n't you lie to me , girl ! " " Please ? " Heather gasped . " Let the child alone , Fanny , " Uncle John said , standing in the curtained doorway of their bedroom . Aunt Fanny turned on him with a snarl . " Look who 's givin ' orders so early this morning . You 're no better than she , moonin ' o'er somethin ' you ai n't got , always wishin ' for what you had but lost ! " " Please , Fanny , not again , " he sighed wearily , hanging his head in despair . " Not again you say . Yet you live with that woman 's memory every day you live . The only reason you took me for your wife is ' cause you could naught have her ! She loved another besides you . " 51  | He flinched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his shoulders drooping more with his defeat . Aunt Fanny wheeled around on Heather and gave her an angry shove . " Get on with your work and stop dillydallying ! " With a quick , pitying glance toward her uncle , Heather grabbed up the pail from the floor and hurried across the room to the door . She could not bear the sight of her uncle 's sagging shoulders . A week went by , then two , the last seeming even longer than the first . No matter how hard she toiled , Heather could not push her disturbing memories aside . She was plagued night and day . Many times she would wake in the darkness of night with a cold sweat moistening her brow , having dreamt again that Captain Birmingham was with her , holding her against his long , lean body in a fierce , passionate embrace . In other dreams he would appear as the devil , laughing heartily at her quivering form , and she would awaken with her hands crushed to her ears . Dreams of William Court were just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , holding the fruit knife in her hand , and from her fingers blood would be dripping . Another two weeks drifted by without relief , and it was beginning to tell on her . Her appetite fluctuated from complete lack of hunger to r ausea to insatiable cravings . She suffered from drowsiness , an unforgiveable sin in her aunt 's opinion . She had received enough bruises to be aware of that . And she did awkward things , such as carelessly dropping dishes or burning her fingers on hot kettles . It was enough to drive a person mad . It threw her aunt into a frenzy , especially after she broke a treasured bowl . " What do you think you 're doing to my home , you vicious little bitch , breaking everything in sight like you are ? Do you want me to take a stick to you ? " she screeched , giving her niece a slap across the face . Heather fell to her knees , trembling violently , her face stinging from the blow , and began to pick up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she croaked , tears scalding her cheeks . " I do n't know what 's come over me . I ca n't seem to do anything right anymore . " " As if you ever did , " sneered the woman contemptuously . " I 'll sell my pink gown and buy you another . " " And what will you sell to pay for the rest of the things broken ? " Aunt Fanny inquired sarcastically , knowing well that the gown was worth more than all the broken items put together . It 52  | " I have nothing more . " Heather whispered miserably , rising to her feet . " Only my shift . " " It ai n't worth a farthing , and I wo n't be having your tits poppin ' out of those old dresses of mine when you go to the village . " Blushing deeply , Heather pulled the neck of the gown up for the hundredth time that day . The dress was so large that what had been modest for her aunt was just the opposite for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal . If not for the string tied around her waist it would divulge everything , right down to her knees , especially since she had nothing to wear underneath . For modesty 's sake , she had to save her chemise to wear when she went to the village . It was less than a month later when she finally received permission to go with her uncle to the village . Though she had waited anxiously through the weeks for the authorization from her aunt , she was leery of going because her uncle still continued to watch her . It made her jittery to have him stare at her so . She feared that once out of Aunt Fanny 's sight he would be tempted to ask questions , wanting to know about William Court , and she wondered if going to the little hamlet was worth them finding out that the man was dead ; however accidentally it had been , she was still to blame . But she had to go . It was the only way she could read the town paper that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment elsewhere , the better . Besides , her aunt was expecting a lovely gift from the bartered gown . White-washed cottages with thatched roofs nested cozily by the village pond , and an inn near the crossroads invited strangers to stop and enjoy the peaceful serenity of the country hamlet . Late summer flowers adorned window boxes and flowerbeds , and trimmed hedges made do as fences between the cottages . It was by far a nicer place to live than London , where filth , beggars and sinfulness predominated . When they arrived in the hamlet , Heather and her uncle went immediately to the village common , a piece of land a chain or so square in the center of which a posting board stood . Uncle John made a habit of going there first . It was his only contact with the world outside the boundaries of the village and his farm . There Heather discreetly scanned the notices . A scullery maid was needed , she read , but she cringed at the thought . Someone desired a governess , making her heart thump wildly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specified an older woman , no younger than forty . Her eyes ran over the notices again as she prayed desperately to find one she had missed which would be suitable . She was willing to work as a maid , but if 53  | there was something better , she would be happier . But there was nothing more . Her hopes fell , and when her uncle turned to go , she followed in his path with tear-filled eyes . He led her next to a shop where she could select a replacement for Aunt Fanny 's broken dish . She did so listlessly , feeling now in the lowest of spirits . When her uncle had pulled the little cart to a halt near the square , she had been wonderfully elated because he had not questioned her . Now , though still thankful for his unasking silence , she wanted to go somewhere alone and cry . She chided herself for being so impatient . There was bound to be a notice later that she would find agreeable . But her aunt let her come so rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could return , and that would mean having to stay with her aunt just that much longer . Mr. Peeves , the shopkeeper , took the dish she handed to him . " Will there be anything else , Maid Heather  --  a new gown perhaps ? " Her face flushed with color . It was not the first time he made mention of a new gown . She knew how everyone stared at her with pitying glances behind her back and how the young girls made merry of her oversize clothes . She had too much pride not to be embarrassed . But as long as she had life left in her body she would hold her head high and pretend it did n't matter . " No , " she replied . " I just want the bowl . " " A very lovely dish it is too , well worth the money . That 'll be six shillings , Maid Heather . " She dug the knotted kerchief from her pocket and untied it . She counted out the money carefully and gave it to him . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aunt would eventually be getting . Her eyes went longingly to some colorful ribbons on a nearby table . " The blue would go pretty in your hair , Maid Heather , " Mr. Peeves suggested , having sharp eyes in his head . He took up the ribbon and handed it to her . " Try it on , why do n't you ? " Glancing uncertainly at her uncle , Heather let the shopkeeper press it into her hand . She turned slowly to the mirror , the only one in the village , and raised her eyes . It was the first time she had looked at herself in a mirror dressed as she was . Her hair was neatly braided and looped heavily from above each ear , and she was well-scrubbed and her clothes clean , but it made little difference in the absurdity of her dress . Her aunt 's gown fit worse than any sack , making her slight figure appear even smaller . No wonder people stare at me and laugh , she thought wearily . The door of the shop opened and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was Henry Whitesmith , a tall , thin lad of one and twenty who had long been infatuated with John Simmons ' niece . Though Heather had never encouraged him , he was always near when she was about , gazing upon her with adoring eyes , taking her hand whenever possible . She was fond of him , but only in a sisterly way . He came immediately to where she stood and grinned down at her . " I saw your uncle 's cart outside . I was in hopes you would be with him . " She smiled at him warmly . " It 's nice to see you , Henry . " He blushed with pleasure . " Where 've you been ? I 've missed you . " She shrugged her shoulders , glancing away . " Nowhere , Henry . I 've just been staying at home with Aunt Fanny . " She did n't want to speak of her trip to London . She felt her uncle 's eyes on her , but she did n't care . The door opened once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looked up , knowing that Henry was never without a tagtail . The new arrival advanced toward him but came to an abrupt halt when she spied Heather . The expression on her face changed , and Heather shivered under the withering stare . It was n't the first time Sarah had glared at Heather , being as jealous as she was of Henry 's attentiveness to another girl . Sarah would have gladly done more if it had brought Henry down on his knees before her . Their families had already discussed the dowry she would be bringing to him when they were married , but he stood stubbornly opposed to being wed , and Sarah knew his infatuation with Heather to be the reason . It did n't matter how much she made fun of Heather 's odd dress with the other village girls , she was still well aware , as were they , that beside Heather Simmons , even dressed as she was , they were found lacking . Even her own father had commented often of the uncommon beauty the Simmons girl possessed . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Irish girl . Henry scowled at Sarah before he turned back to Heather . " I have to talk with you , " he whispered urgently , reaching out to touch her arm . " Could you meet me by the pond later ? " " I do n't know , Henry , " Heather replied softly . " I have to stay with my uncle . Aunt Fanny does n't like me wandering off alone . " " If he can keep an eye on you , can you still talk with me ? " he asked hopefully . She frowned slightly , confused . " I suppose so , but not for very long . " 55  | " Have him bring you to the pond before you leave , " he said in a rush . " I 'll be waiting . " He left her without saying more and brushed past Sarah on his way from the shop . It was n't long before the girl followed him out . Later , when Uncle John stopped his cart by the pond , Heather descended and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was unable to speak for a moment as he gazed at her with adoring eyes , tracing lovingly each detail of her small , perfect features . When he did , his voice was uncertain and quavered with emotion . " Heather , " he choked out . " Do you think your aunt would ill-favor me . I mean  --  would she think me not good enough for to court you ? " Heather looked up at him , surprised . " But , Henry , I have no dowry . " " Ah-h , Heather , I care naught that you have none . I love you , not what you can bring me . " She could hardly believe her ears . Here , indeed , was the suitor she thought she would never have because she possessed no dowry . But he was too late . She was no longer a virgin . She could never bring herself to marry any man now , sullied as she was . " Henry , you know as well as I that your family would never let you marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'll naught marry if I ca n't have you , Heather , and my family ' wants my children . They 'll come round soon enough for us . " Heather 's gaze dropped to her clenched hands . " Henry , I ca n't marry you . " The boy frowned . " Why , Heather ? Are you afraid of having a man bed you ? If that be it , rest at ease . I would naught touch you lest you felt ready for me . " She smiled sadly . Here was patience and love offered to her and she could not take them . Captain Birmingham had seen to that . What a difference there was between the two men . She could n't feature the bearded captain of the Fleetwood being so patient with a woman . It was a pity she could n't marry Henry and lead a normal quiet life here in the village and raise children they both could love . But that was out of the question now . " Henry , " she whispered softly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves you very much and she would make you a good wife . " " Sarah do n't know who she loves , " Henry snapped . " She 's always chasing after some boy and right now it happens to be me . " She chided him gently . " Henry , that is n't so . She sees no one but you . She wants to marry you very much . " 56  | Henry was n't having any of it . " But I want you for my wife , Heather , not some simple-minded , plain girl like Sarah . " " You should n't say things that are n't true , Henry , " she said in the same soft , reproving voice . " Sarah would make a far better wife than I. " " Please ! Do n't speak more of her ! " Henry cried . His face had taken on a tormented expression , not so different from the one that had been on Sarah 's face . " I want only to look at and think of you . Please , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court you . I ca n't wait much longer to make you my wife . " Here it was , a plea for her hand . Her aunt perhaps would be surprised . But it was too late . Now she had to convince this gentle man that she could n't marry him . But he would not listen . What was she expected to do  --  tell him what had happened to her ? Then he would be repulsed , sickened , and she would be shamed . " Henry , I wo n't ask my aunt if she will allow it . I can not marry you . It would n't be fair to you . I could never be happy here . Do n't you see , Henry ? I was brought up much differently . I 'm used to having everything done for me and being dressed in the finest clothes . I ca n't be content being a mere cobbler 's wife . " The look on his face plunged a sharp pain through her bosom , yet Heather knew it was best this way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize he had a life to live without her . She watched in agony as he staggered from her , blinded by his tears . " Oh my God ! " he cried . " I loved you the moment I saw you . I naught could think of no one but you these two years past . And now , you say I 'm not good enough for you . You 're a black-hearted wench , Heather Simmons ! May God have mercy on your soul ! " Heather stretched out a hand to him pleadingly , but he was gone , not caring where he ran , stumbling , then rising again . Tears welled up in her eyes and rolled down her cheeks as she watched him run away . " I 'm cruel , " she thought . " I 've hurt him deeply and now he will despise me . " She turned toward the cart and walked slowly back . Her uncle was watching her . He always watched her now . Was he ever to stop ? " What 's the matter with young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to pull her into the cart . His fingers closed over her upper arm , and he lifted her up as she clung to his shoulder . " He asked to court me , " she murmured , taking a place beside him on the narrow seat . She wished not to discuss it . Her stomach quivered and she felt sick . 57  | " And you told him no ? " he questioned . She nodded her head slowly as though an incautious movement might make her retch . She shuddered and was silent , and he , thankfully , stared off into the distance over the head of the old horse that pulled them , lost in thought . The first of October passed and the weather grew cooler . Here and there a stray leaf drifted to the ground and came to rest on grass still green . Squirrels could be seen scurrying along limbs of trees in search of food to hoard for the winter . Soon it would be time for slaughter and Heather dreaded even the thought . She needed no further encouragement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself from the cot with an effort , feeling sick and listless and wondering if she would ever get well . With the extra load of chores her aunt had thrust upon her , she was finding it hard to keep her illness a secret . She had vowed never to allow her aunt to see her ailing , but it was becoming difficult . I Sometimes she felt so faint she expected to collapse any moment . She had hoped in time that those tormenting memories which made her ill would leave her in peace . But still they remained with her , and so did her troubled stomach and frayed nerves . " Stop your mopin ' around and finish those dishes , missy . " 4 Heather shook off the daze that enveloped her and hurriedly wiped another wooden bowl . In just a moment more , she would be able to relax in a warm bath and soothe her aching body . She was tired and weary , and there was a dull ache in the small of her back . She had done the washing earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the lifting , the scrubbing , the beating , the reaching . And later she had almost swooned when carrying in a load of firewood . She put the dishes away and dragged out the wooden tub for her bath . Watching her , Aunt Fanny picked up another sweet tart from the table and stuffed a great part of it into her large mouth . Heather shuddered , wondering how the woman could eat so much . It seemed her aunt 's favorite pastime . She wished the woman would go to bed as Uncle John had done . She would prefer to bathe in peace . But her aunt was n't budging , so Heather filled the tub and tested the water . It was pleasantly hot . She unfastened her dress and let it slide from her shoulders down to the floor . She stood before the hearth , totally unclad , her smooth skin glowing in the light of the fire , and her slender body was clearly silhouetted 61 58  | in its glow . Her breasts rose heavier now and were taut , around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly Aunt Fanny choked on the tart she was swallowing . With a strangled cry she leapt from her chair , alarming her niece who whirled around to look at her . The woman 's eyes were wider , staring at her in horror , and her face had gone from beet red to ashen gray . Aunt Fanny charged across the room toward her and Heather cringed away , thinking her aunt had gone mad . She was seized viciously by the arms . " Who are you breeding by , missy ? What jackal have ycou hooked yourself to ? " the woman screeched . Cold , dreaded shock seized Heather 's every nerve . Her eyes grew very wide and her face very pale . In her innocence she had not thought of this . As she had lain under Captain Birmingham sand struggled with him , she had not considered the consequences of hiis act . She had reasoned her failure to come sick at her normal times to be because she was so upset with everything that had happened to her . But now she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fa baby by that scoundrel of a sea captain . That cad ! Madman ! Lunatic ! Oh God , she thought , why ? Why ? Livid with rage , Aunt Fanny shook Heather until her head threatened to snap off . " Who is it ? Who 's the bloody toad ? " she cried . Her hands tightened around Heather 's arms until it brought an outcry of pain from the girl 's lips . " Tell me or by me God I 'll wring it out of you ! " Heather found it impossible to think . She was dulled , senseless with shock . " Please  --  oh , please let me go , " she murmured in confusion . A look of enlightenment crossed Aunt Fanny 's face , and she shoved Heather into a nearby chair . " Henry  --  that 's who it is , ai n't it ? Your uncle said he was sweet on you , and now I know the reason . He 's the father of the babe . If he thinks he 'll ruin my good name in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . I told you if you ever sinned , you 'd be found to reckon with and now you 're going to wed Henry . The filthy good-for-nothing ! He 'll pay for it , he will ! " Slowly some sense seeped through Heather 's trauma . She became aware of what her aunt was saying , of Henry 's name spoken . Shivering and addled , she forced herself to some semblance of awareness . Whatever she did , she could not let Henry take the blame . She could not hurt him like that and have him despise her more . Trembling , she picked up her gown from the floor and pulled it to her naked body . " It was n't Henry , " she said softly . 59  | Her aunt swung round . " Eh ? What you say , girl ? " Heather sat unmoving , staring into the fire . " It was n't Henry , " she repeated . " And who was it if it were n't the cobbler ? " the woman questioned fiercely . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listlessly , dropping her cheek against the tall , crude back of the chair she sat in . The flames from the fire illuminated her small face . " His men found me and took me to him and he forced himself upon me . God 's truth . " What did it matter now if she told of the defilement she had suffered in the hands of that man ? Everyone would know in a few months of her pregnancy unless her aunt decided to keep her at the cottage and not allow her to go into the village . Even then , how would they explain the baby 's presence after the child was born ? Her aunt 's brow knitted in confusion . " What are you saying ? Found you when ? Where was this ? " Heather could not bring herself to tell the woman of William 's death . " I was lost from your brother and the Yankee seamen found me , " she murmured , still staring into the crackling fire . " They gave I ! me to their captain for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was only through my threat to shoot his man that I gained my freedom . I ? came here straightaway . " " How did you get lost from William ? " Heather closed her eyes . " We went  --  to a fair  --  and somehow we became separated . I did n't tell you before because I could n't see the need . It 's the Yankee 's child I carry , not Henry 's . But the man wo n't marry me . He 's one who takes and does what he pleases and he wo n't be pleased to marry me . " The frown was wiped away from Aunt Fanny 's face , and a slow menacing smile replaced it . " We 'll see about that . Now , tell me , did n't your pa have a friend who be magistrate judge in London ? Lord Hampton was his name , were n't it ? And did n't he control the investigation of all the ships suspected of smuggling ? " Again confusion swept over Heather . Her thoughts were too muddled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She answered hesitantly . " Yes , Lord Hampton did and still does as far as I know . But why ? " smile deepened . " Ne'er you mind with the reasons . I want to IP know more of Lord Hampton . Did he know you and was he very good friends with your pa ? " 60  | A frown touched Heather 's smooth brow . " Lord Hampton was one of my father 's closest friends . He used to come to our home often . He 's known me since I was a baby . " " Well , all you need know right now , missy , is that he is going to help you get wed , " Aunt Fanny said , a cold , calculating expression on her face . " Now get your bath and go to bed . We 're going to London tomorrow , and we 'll be having to rise early so we wo n't be missin ' the coach going through the village . It wo n't do to go in a cart when we 'll be callin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Heather got to her feet with an effort , completely baffled by her aunt . Why the woman wanted to know about Lord Hampton she did n't know , but Aunt Fanny was a master schemer of devious plans , and it would n't do to question her . Obediently Heather slid into the wooden tub , feeling a heaviness in her lower abdomen as though she were just now with child , and all the time before , unscathed . There was no doubt whatsoever in her mind that she was breeding . She should have expected just such as this from the Yankee bull . Strong , potent , full-blooded , he had done a man 's due with an ease she found maddening . How was it when a great many men sweated over their mates month after month with little to show for it , that she had to have the misfortune to be taken to bed by such a virile male being . O000hh , he is abominable ! She cried inwardly and added , quivering , He is a devil . A stifled cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , realizing what it would mean to her if he were forced to marry her . Her soul and life would be lost , married to the blackguard . She would be damned . But at least the child would have a name and perhaps some good would come of that . Her thoughts strayed to the unborn child . He was destined to be dark-haired , with both his parents being so , and he would likely be handsome if he took after his father . Poor child , it would be better if he were born ugly than to be a handsome scoundrel like his sire . But what if the child were a girl ? It would be a great blow to the man 's confidence if such a thing happened , great manly beast that he was . If she married him , Heather thought venomously , she would pray for a girl . Before she finished bathing Heather heard her uncle begin to stir in the other room where Aunt Fanny had gone when leaving her . Their muffled voices had come to her as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell him of Heather 's predicament .  | Heather rose from the tub and clutched the towel over her bosom just as her uncle came from the tiny room . He appeared to have aged ten years . " Heather , girl , I have to speak with you , please . " She blushed crimson , hugging the towel to cover her nakedness . He seemed not to notice that she was without clothes . " Heather , are you tellin ' the truth ? Was it this Yankee who planted his seed in you ? " " Why do you ask ? " she inquired cautiously , fearfully . John Simmons rubbed his brow with a shaking hand . " Heather ? Heather , did William ever touch you ? Did he ever hurt you in any way , girl ? " Now Heather knew why her uncle had watched her so closely after she returned from London . He knew William , and had been worried about her . She could do nothing but reassure him now . " No , Uncle , he did n't hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , there was a fair and I wanted to go , and he was kind enough to take me . But I got lost and could n't find him . That 's when these men found me and took me to their captain . The Yankee is the father . " A sigh of relief escaped the man , and a small , quivery smile crossed hic face . " I thought  --  never mind . Just say I worried about you , but now we must find the man who be the sire , and this time I wo n't fail you . Me brother 's child , I can not fail again . " Heather managed a smile for her uncle . She could n't tell him it would do no good to go to London to talk with Captain Birmingham because the man would not marry her . She was silent . When they reached London , they took up lodging at an inn . Uncle John immediately sent a message to Lord Hampton asking to be granted an appointment and the next day was received by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained behind at the inn to await the outcome of the meeting . Heather dared not ask what they were about , but she was more than curious . When Uncle John came back , he went directly into conference with his wife . It seemed to Heather that whatever they were planning , it was going well because her uncle was in better spirits than when he had left . She was told to go to bed early that night after her uncle had taken it upon himself to reassure her that Lord Hampton would be helping to solve their problem . " He 's only to see we 're telling the truth and he will do what he 62  | must . And your Yankee wo n't be refusing to wed you lest he wants to lose everything he has and be thrown into prison . " Heather did n't understand anything . They could n't put a man into prison because he refused to marry a woman he had gotten in the family way . There were too many bastards walking around for that to be so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , and she could only think of the consequences to herself if he were forced into marriage . Her life would be pure hell and no other word would do so well to describe it . But she had no voice in the matter . They had taken it out of her hands . And she could not think which was worse , being married to the devil or having to raise a bastard child . It was almost midnight of that same night when she was awakened rudely from a sound sleep by Aunt Fanny 's large , insistent hands shaking her . " Get up , you evil chit . Your uncle wants to speak with you . " Heather sat up groggily and looked at her aunt who stood beside the bed , holding a lighted candle high above her head . " Hurry with you . We 've naught all night . " Her aunt whirled into the shadows and left the room and Heather stared after her for a moment , blinking away sleep . Reluctantly she l pushed the covers from herself . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling to below her waist , was lost in darkness . For the first time in many weeks she had slept without dreaming . The pitter-patter of rain on the windows had lulled her troubled thoughts to a peaceful quietness and she had curled into the downy softness of the bed and drifted into sweet oblivion . Her unwillingness to hasten from the bed now was understandable . But she must obey her aunt or suffer the consequences . She slid drowsily from the cozy warmth and picked up her aunt 's old dress and pulled it over her head . She did n't bother fastening it . In another moment she would just be taking it off again . She had an idea why they wanted to speak with her . She was well prepared to hear them say that Captain Birmingham had refused to be coerced into marriage . It would come as no surprise . They could have saved themselves a trip to London if they had asked her about the man . It would not take them long to tell her what he had said . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was flung open h by her aunt . The woman motioned her in with a hateful glower . As I. she moved into the room she was aware of its darkness . A small fire glowed in the hearth and only one candle burned on the table where her uncle and another man were sitting , quaffing ale from pewter 63  | tankards . The rest of the room was obscure and shadows were deep . She came closer cautiously to see whom the visitor might be and saw that he was no stranger but an old friend of the family , Lord Hampton . With a cry of relief , Heather flew gratefully into the arms he held open to her . " Heather ! " he choked . " My little Heather . " She clung to him and sobs flooded from the bottom of her soul to be softened against his shoulder . Second to her father , this man was the one she had loved most from childhood . He had been exceedingly kind to her and was more of an uncle than her own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them after her father had died , but Aunt Fanny had insisted that she live with her only kinsfolk . " It 's been long since last I saw you , child , " he murmured , pulling her from him so he could see her better . His kindly blue eyes twinkled at her . " I remember when you were but a tiny tot and you would crawl up on my knee , looking for sweets . " He grinned widely as he lifted her exquisite chin . " And now look at you , a portrait of beauty . Never have I seen such fairness before , never . You are even more lovely than your mother , beauty that she was . It 's a pity I never had sons for you to marry . I would have enjoyed you in the family . Since I have no daughters either , perhaps I can say you are mine . " She reached up to press her lips to his cheek . " I would be honored to be your daughter , " she replied softly . Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to sit down in , but Aunt Fanny shoved Heather away and proceeded to sit there herself . " Let her stand . It 'll do her good , " she sneered , fitting her monstrous shape between the arms of the chair . It squeaked and strained in protest . Caught off guard by the rudeness of the woman , Lord Hampton gazed at her for a moment , wide-eyed . Then he motioned toward a chair at the end of the table . " Perhaps you would be more comfortable here , my dear , " he said to Heather , moving to draw the chair from the table . " No , " Aunt Fanny barked . She gestured to a darkened corner . " That chair is for him . " Heather glanced up in surprise . She had n't known anybody else was in the room . The man sat in the shadows , shrouded in darkness , and his silence gave no clue to his identity . 64  | " Come and join us , Captain Birming'am , " Aunt Fanny crowed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Heather 's heart gave a fearful leap and she swayed on her feet . " No , thank you , madam , " a slow , confident voice replied . " I 'm content where I am . " With the familiar voice burning across her brain , Heather 's knees buckled and she sought solace in a blissful faint . With a cry , Lord Hampton leapt to cushion her fall . " She 's had a bad shock , " he declared , swinging her up into his aging arms . He lowered her with much gentleness into the chair declined by Captain Birmingham and nervously seized a small cloth , dampened it , and pressed it to the pale brow as he bent over her . " Are you all right ? " he questioned anxiously when her eyes fluttered open . " Do n't spoil the girl , Lord Hampton , " Aunt Fanny suggested with a sneer . " She 'll go lazy on you . " " I 'm sure she would be entitled to a rest after living with you , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please , " Heather breathed . " I 'm all right . " He brushed her hair from her brow with trembling fingers . " You gave my old heart a start , " he laughed shakily . " I 'm sorry , " she murmured . " I did n't mean to . I 'm better now . " But still she was trembling , conscious of those searing eyes upon her . With unsteady fingers she clutched her gown closer over her bosom , remembering that powerful gaze which seemed to peel clothes from her and leave bare the tender body beneath . " Come on and let 's get on with it , " Aunt Fanny demanded . " Let 's hear what the girl has to say . " Lord Hampton eyed Heather uncertainly , fearing she would swoon again . Her lips managed a weak smile of reassurance for him , and he left her unwillingly to return to his place at the other end of the table . " Now , with taking the action he 's going to , missy , " Aunt Fanny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's naught doing your captain an injustice by makin ' him claim another man 's child . " Heather 's eyes shifted slowly from her aunt to the small , elderly man . She was feeling too dazed to understand completely what they were saying . Lord Hampton scowled at her aunt . " Madam , perhaps unknown to you , I have a tongue in my head , and I vow it more eloquent than your garbled speech . If you do n't mind , I shall speak for myself . " L 65  | Huffily Aunt Fanny snapped her mouth closed and sat back in her chair . " Thank you , " Lord Hampton said curtly before he turned to look at Heather again . " My dear , " he began unhurriedly . " Since I am a man of honor , I can not force Captain Birmingham to claim your child unless I know for certain he is the father . If you 've been put upon by someone else ? " " There 's been no one else , " she assured him quietly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if she had memorized them . " After I escaped from him , I took the coach back to my uncle 's . There 's only one coach leaving during the day to go through the village . It arrived at the village at dusk and I walked the rest of the way home . I met no one on the way nor would there have been time to tarry . My aunt can vouch for the time I reached the cottage . " " And she ai n't been out of my sight one second since , " the woman offered triumphantly . Lord Hampton glanced at Uncle John to receive his verifying nod , then he turned back . " What about before , Heather ? " he persisted hesitantly . She blushed hotly and could give no answer . From the shadows came the same self-possessed voice . " The child is mine , " Brandon stated flatly . A pleased cackle came from Aunt Fanny , and she turned to Lord Hampton with a victorious smirk . " Now what do you say to that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sighed wearily . " To undo the great impropriety inflicted upon Heather because of your wretched carelessness , woman , I must . I lament the day I allowed you to take her under your roof . You should have guarded more carefully this priceless gem . " His angry gaze turned to Uncle John who sat very quietly in his shame . " And you who are of the same blood are worthless in my eyes . You disgust me . " " Well , what about her ? " Aunt Fanny cried . " It was her doing . She was the one who crawled into bed with the bloke . " " No ! " Heather gasped . The involuntary denial escaped her before she realized she had spoken . With a growl , Aunt Fanny turned and viciously slapped Heather across the face , hitting her so hard the soft , bottom lip was bloodied and her cheek bruised . In the darkness behind Heather a tankard of ale was slammed down 66  | on a table in rage . Before her , Heather saw through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . He leaned forward and planted his hands firmly on the table and spoke threateningly to her aunt . " Madam , your actions are of the vilest nature ! You have the manners of a barbarian , and were you a man , I 'd surely demand satisfaction for what you have just done . Now I think it best that Heather go back to bed . It is clear she is upset with the whole matter . " Thinking herself dismissed , Heather rose from the chair and made to walk to the door , but her aunt snatched her by the front of the dress and snarled . " No ! For once she 's going to stand and take her due . No decent girl would get herself in trouble with a man . I 've tried to do my best to put the fear of God in her , but she 's the devil 's handmaiden . Just look at what he give her . " Ruthlessly Fanny ripped the old garment from Heather 's back in one cruel , brutal swipe , leaving for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadows a chair was overturned as Captain Birmingham came angrily to his feet . He strode across the room in long , irate strides , and Fanny fell back , seeing the tall form swathed in a black cloak and the angry face red in the glow of the fire . Her eyes widened and her feet were frozen to the floor . She recalled accusing Heather of being born a witch and was sure that this man before her was Satan incarnate . She threw up her hands as if to defend herself , but instead the Yankee whipped the rain moistened cloak from his shoulders and dragged it around Heather as she tried desperately to hide her nakedness . He enfolded her quaking slightness in the flowing garment , making Heather tremble more violently with fright . The proximity of his long , muscular body was terror in itself . Above her dark head , a muscle twitched furiously in Brandon 's cheek as his angry glare took in the three startled people staring at him . " Enough of this useless prattle , " he demanded coldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livelihood will be my responsibility . I will delay my trip home to see that Heather is comfortably settled in a house of her own with servants to care for her . " He looked at Lord Hampton . " You have my guarantee that she and the child will be supported in a manner suitable to her upbringing . It is certain she must no longer live with her kinsfolk , nor would I allow my child to be subjected to the malice of this woman who calls herself an aunt . I had planned for this to be my last voyage here , but under the circumstances I will continue coming every year so that I may see to their 67  | welfare . Tomorrow morning I will set about finding suitable accommodations for the girl , then later I will return here for her and take her to a clothier 's so she may be aptly dressed . Now , sir , I wish to get back to my ship . If you have more to say to these people , I will wait in your carriage until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze directly to Aunt Fanny and spoke dangerously slow and precisely . " I suggest , madam , that you keep your hands to yourself while this girl is still in your care or you will greatly wish that you had . " With that , he walked from them to the door , and Heather caught a 11 glimpse of his angry , aristocratic profile and tall , lean body elegantly clothed in deep red velvet , then he was gone with only a pledge to sustain his bastard child and its mother . No one had even brought the subject of marriage to his consideration . He was going to make her a kept woman . " He wo n't be so high and mighty when we finish with him , " Aunt Fanny sneered . Lord Hampton looked at her with cold eyes . " It is with considerable distaste that I must appear to satisfy your vengeful whim , " he ground out flatly . " If not for Heather , I would put the matter from me and have done with it . But I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altar . But you are to be warned , madam , the man has a temper . You will do well to heed his words . " " He has no right to tell me how to treat the girl . " " You are wrong there , madam , " he replied slowly . " He is the father of her babe and in a few hours he will be her husband . "  | The sun came in rays of sparkling light through the water-speckled windows and touched on Heather 's face to awaken her . She stirred in half awakened ecstasy and stretched and rolled over , snuggling deeper into the downy bed as she hugged a pillow to her . She had been dreaming she was again in the home of her father . Now a soft , rainsweetened breeze flirted with a curtain where a window had been left ajar and drifted to the bed to caress her cheek . Heather inhaled deeply and released her breath with a grateful sigh . The usual morning queasiness was in absence , letting her enjoy the smell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then sat up with a start . Captain Birmingham 's cloak was slung over the back of a chair near the bed , and it sent her thoughts racing with a fleetness that only fear could provoke . " The arrogant fool ! " she hissed with venom . " Does he think he can put me in a house of his procuring and make me his mistress ? I 'll whelp in the gutter before I accept his half-witted proposal ! " Even now , she thought shrewishly , he 's probably thinking how tender it will be when he takes me to the house and carries me to the bedchamber . He will think me grateful for his generosity and that I will submit to him accordingly . I would be no better than a harlot ! No ! Rather that I slit my throat from ear to ear than let him make me his mistress . He can not touch my belly with his vile hands and know his bastard son grows within me ! No ! Never will I submit to him in that way ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry her , she wondered frantically . She would have to yield to him then and obey him . And he would not be so gentle when full of rage . " Oh , pray that he does n't hurt me too much , " she uttered , a shudder of fright passing through her body . 69  | A moment later there came a knock on the door , and rather than wear his hated cloak again , she tore the sheet from the bed and wrapped it around her body , flipping the end over her shoulder . So garmented , she opened the door and found a gray-haired woman standing in the doorway and behind her , two girls of an age no more than herself , carrying an assortment of cases . " Maid Heather , " the older woman said with a smile . " I 'm Mrs. Todd and these two girls are my assistants . We 've come from Lord Hampton , and be here to fix you for your wedding . " Something cold and fearful gripped Heather 's heart and sent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby chair for support , fearing her knees would give way . Mrs. Todd noticed nothing of her pallor or her shaking hands . She was too busy ushering the two girls in with their cases . " Have you eaten this morning , love ? " she asked , turning to Heather at last . Heather shook her head . " No , " she whispered . " Oh , well , do n't you worry about a thing , love . I 'll send one of the girls down to fetch breakfast . We 'd not have you fainting from hunger when the betrothals are being said , would we ? And we do have a lot to do ' til then . You 'll be needing your strength , slight lass that you are . " " When will the wedding be ? " Heather managed to ask . The woman showed no surprise at the strange question asked by the young bride . " This afternoon , love . " Heather slithered into a chair with a weak , " Oh . " " Someone should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can see how they forgot to . His lordship says the groom is anxious to 1 I wed and will not brook a delay . Most certainly I can see his reason for impatience . Such a beauty you are , love . " But Heather was n't listening . Her imagination was already sweeping her to the coming night when she would lie beside Captain Birmingham and feel his panting breath against her mouth and his strong , ruthless hands upon her body . Her face burned at the thought . He would not care how he bruised her , and she wondered if she would be able to still her trembling body and not anger him more by struggling . She jumped from the chair in a quick , nervous movement and went to the window , fearing that she would not be able to . Her teeth tugged at her bottom lip as she felt the tension begin to mount . She had hoped for more time . She had n't dreamed they would force the marriage so 70  | soon . How could she possibly go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he might ? Much to her alarm , her moments of freedom slid away with frightening speed . As in a daze , she found herself fed , bathed , perfumed and groomed , all against her stunned will . No moment of that morning was hers . As they tugged and pulled and goaded , she thought she might scream in rage at them to leave her be . The noon meal came and though she was not hungry , she pretended to eat so they would give her rest , dropping the food from the window to a hungry mongrel when they were n't looking . But as soon as the tray was taken away , everything began again . No part of her body was left untouched , no matter what shame it caused her , and when she tried to protest , the three argued . " But , lass , a touch of essence here or there will make a strong , grand man from a shy , bashful sort . " And Heather thought wildly that just the opposite was needed for the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time allowed to gaze upon herself . What she saw was herself , yet not the Heather she had always seen . She had never looked this way before . For a frightening moment she caught a glimpse of the beauty that others saw and found uncommon . Her hair , brushed to a silky sheen , was coiled intricately through itself and around the top of her head to resemble the coiffure of a Greek goddess . A tiara of golden spikes and pearls crowned her head , and below it , blue feline eyes stared back at her in alarm . The definite slant of her eyes fringed by the long , sooty lashes was made even more noticeable by the manner of hairstyle which was drawn tightly from her face . Her cheekbones , fragile and high , allowing for a slight hollowness beneath them , had been pinched and were no longer pale . Her soft , pink mouth was slightly opened with her awe . " A lass more fair than you does not live , Maid Heather . " The moment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With love , Lady Hampton had sent as a gift her own wedding gown , an elegant garment resembling somewhat a monk 's habit complete with hood . It was ice blue in color and made of rich , heavy satin cut in simple , slender lines . The sleeves reached to the wrist and were , as the skirt of the gown , slightly flared . Elaborate golden embroidery and countless seed pearls embellished the hood and sleeves , and placed about the hips was a girdle of great beauty and considerable fortune . It was of gold leather and was richly sewn with pearls and rubies . A train a good arm 's length longer than herself waited to be attached 71  | with gold chains and its heavy satin was richly embroidered and embellished with the gold and seed pearls . A costume fit for a queen , Heather thought drearily . She frowned suddenly and moved to the window again . The hour of her doom was growing near . Time was fast draining away and still she trembled . " For once in my life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please let me be brave . " Behind her the door swung open and Aunt Fanny marched in . " Well now , I see you 're all dressed in your finery , " the woman sneered . " And I 'm supposin ' you be thinkin ' you look pretty , ai n't you ? But you look no better'n what you did in my old dress . " Mrs. Todd stiffened her spine as if the insult had been directed at her . " I beg your pardon , madam ! " " Oh , hush your mouth , " Aunt Fanny snapped at the woman . " Please , Aunt Fanny , " Heather pleaded softly . " Mrs. Todd has worked hard . " " Aye , I 'm sure she had to with you . " " Madam , " Mrs. Todd said coldly . " The girl is not deserving of criticism . She be by far the comeliest maid I 've ever had the pleasure to attend or have ever seen for that matter . " " She 's the daughter of Satan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing , and ' cause of it , no man will find peace with himself after he 's seen her . It 's the devil 's way of makin ' man lust after a witch , and to me she 's ugly . That man she 's marryin ' is her just mate . The two of them be of the devil ! " " That 's nonsense ! " Mrs. Todd cried . " The girl is an angel . " " Angel , is it ? I do n't suppose she told you why she 's gettin ' wedded so soon , did she ? " From the open doorway where he had come to stand and listen , Uncle John spoke with a slow but steady voice . " It 's ' cause Captain Birmingham wants her without delay , ai n't it , Fanny ? " The obese woman turned in a huff , ready to snarl a denial at him , but something , perhaps her fear of the Yankee sea captain , made her silence the angry words that came to her lips before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made as if to pinch her , but Heather quickly glided out of her way , reasoning the less pain she suffered now , the better prepared she would be for it later . " I can say I 'll be happy to get you off my hands , " Aunt Fanny spat . " You 've naught been a pleasure to have around . " Heather flinched under the biting remark . Tears came to her eyes as 72  | she turned once again to the window . All her life she had lacked the love of her kinsfolk . What her father had given to her had been marred by unhappiness , and now she was destined to go through life without knowing of another . Even the son , if it was to be a son , whom she was carrying would probably be encouraged to hate his mother by a father who was forced to be one . There would never be another chance for love in her life . An hour later , stiff and unsmiling , Heather descended from the steps of the rented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cathedral loomed upward , overpowering in its immensity , and she , small and insignificant before it , mounted the steps , clinging to her uncle 's arm . She was numb to the world about her . She did things mechanically . She put one foot in front of the other as she was towed along by her uncle . Mrs. Todd , who had come along for last minute assistance , walked beside her , fussing with the bridal cape that she held draped over her arms . The woman would have swooned if some harm had come to it . She worried and clucked like a mother hen over her brood , but Heather scarcely noticed her . She stared straight ahead toward the high , main portal of the cathedral , coming closer with each step she was taking . It gaped dark and sinister , waiting with maddening patience to swallow her life . Then she was under its arched frame , moving into the vestry , and she stopped because her uncle stopped . The organ music drummed on her heart and sounded loud in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hood over her head , attaching the long train at her shoulders with the gold chains , spreading it out behind to its full length . Someone handed her a small , white Bible with a golden cross stamped in the soft leather , and she took it without thinking . " Pinch your cheeks , Heather , " Aunt Fanny scolded harshly from somewhere near . " And stop lookin ' so frightened or I 'll pinch you myself . " Mrs. Todd glared at the woman , then did her duty by bringing some life to Heather 's cheeks herself . " You 're the queen of the day , love , " she whispered to Heather and gave a final adjustment to the crown and hood . The music changed and so did the beat of Heather 's heart . The shock brought her out of her daze . t " ' T is time , love , " Mrs. Todd said quietly . " Is  --  is he in there ? " Heather murmured to the woman , hoping greatly that he had refused finally to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioned . 73  | " She 's talkin ' about the Yankee , " Aunt Fanny hissed . " Yes , pet , " Mrs. Todd replied kindly . " He 's standing before the altar waiting for you . And a high handsome man he is too , from what I can see of him . " Heather swayed weakly against Mrs. Todd and the older woman steadied her with a helping arm and a smile and walked her to the door . " It will all be over in a moment , love , " she said , giving a final encouragement before the door swung open . Then Lord Hampton was offering his arm to her and she took it mechanically , moving on her own quaking limbs beside him down the aisle . She could feel the pounding of her heart inside her breast and the weight of the Bible in her hand . The heavy burden of the train tugged at her shoulders , seeming to hold her back , but she moved on as the great organ drowned out all other sounds , even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned beyond the group standing there , making them dark shadows in a dimly-lit church . But she knew which one was her husband-to-be by his height . No one in the world seemed as tall as he at the moment . She came closer and the candlelight touched on his face , and for a lit second Heather was halted by the cold , stark features . She had an overwhelming desire to flee . Her bottom lip quivered , and she caught at it nervously with her teeth to still its cowardly shaking as Lord Hampton moved away from her , leaving her alone . The green eyes before her roamed insultingly over her person , divesting her of her bridal gown in a cruel , heartless way , and Heather trembled more violently . The Yankee stretched out a strong , brown hand and offered it to her as his leer brought a deep blush to her pale face . Reluctantly she lifted her hand , which was cold as ice , and placed it in his much larger , much warmer one , and he drew her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tall and powerful he stood , garmented regally in black velvet and flawless white . He was Satan to her . Handsome . Ruthless . Evil . He could draw her soul from her body and never feel remorse . If she were brave , she would turn now before the vows were spoken and fly from the insanity of what they were doing to her . Every day women gave birth to bastard sons and raised them in the streets . Why was she not so courageous ? Surely having to beg for food and being destitute were lesser evils than being thrown into the fires of hell . 74  | But even as she argued with herself , she slid to her knees with the man beside her and bowed her head to pray for the blessings of God . Time stood still as they were swept into the marriage ceremony , and all the while every nerve , every sense she possessed screamed of the presence beside her . The lean , well manicured hands held her gaze and the closeness of his body lent to her nostrils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many strong perfumes meant to cover the stench of unwashed bodies , but fleeting and inoffensive , a clean , masculine smell . " At least he is well washed , " she mused . She heard him respond to the priest 's urging in a firm , steady voice . " I , Brandon Clayton Birmingham , take you , Heather Brianna Simmons , to be my lawful wedded wife ? " Thankfully appearing not to falter , she spoke the same words , pledging herself to this man in soft tones . It seemed only a moment later that he was sliding a gold band upon her finger and they were again bowing their heads before the priest . She rose finally on shaky limbs as her new husband drew to his full height . He looked down at her unkindly , his green eyes freezing to her hesitant gaze . " I believe it is customary for the groom to kiss the bride , " he said . She replied in a nervous strained voice . " Yes . " She feared she would faint under his stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her heart . His long , brown fingers moved around the delicate bones of her jaw and gripped it firmly so she could not move her face away while his other arm slid behind her back under the loose , flowing train . He crushed her to him suddenly in a fierce , possessive embrace , and Heather 's eyes widened and her face drained of color . She felt the eyes of the others on them , but he seemed not to mind . On the contrary , he seemed to welcome their stares . His arm was like a band of iron around her , squeezing the life from her small body , pressing her tighter against him . His head lowered and his parted lips moved over hers in a passionate kiss . His open mouth was wet and searing , demanding and insulting , leaving her little dignity . Her hand struggled up and strained against him piteously . From somewhere near she heard Lord Hampton cough uncomfortably and her uncle murmur something unintelligible . Finally the priest touched Brandon 's arm and spoke awkwardly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son . The others are waiting to congratulate you . " 75  | At last his grip slackened and she could breathe . Her quivering mouth burned from his blistering lips and an imprint of his fingers was clearly marked upon her fair skin . She turned on wobbly knees and smiled tremulously as Lord and Lady Hampton came up to her . The kindly man gave her a fatherly kiss upon the brow . " I hope I have not done wrongly with you , Heather , " he said uncertainly , glancing up at Captain Birmingham who stood stiff and unyielding beside her . " My intentions were to see you cared for , but ? " " Please , " she murmured , reaching out to place shaking fingers against his lips . She could n't let him finish . If she heard her fears put into words , she would run shrieking from them all , tearing at her garments and hair in an excess of insane passion . Lady Hampton glanced up timorously at the Yankee captain who stared coldly ahead , his mighty seaman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back . He appeared to be standing on the deck of a ship , staring out across an ocean . Her hands trembled uncontrollably as she embraced Heather and tears moistened her eyes . The two women , both small and slight , clung to each other in their distress . As if the thought just occurred to him , Lord Hampton quickly node a proposal . " You will stay the night at Hampshire Hall . There will be more room there for you than in the ship 's cabin . " He did n't add that any room there would be easily accessible to him if Heather screamed while in the hands of her new husband . Brandon turned his frigid gaze upon the smaller man . " And of course you insist upon that also , " he growled . His lordship faced him with an unwavering stare . " Yes , I do , " he said calmly . A muscle twitched angrily in Brandon 's cheek , but he said nothing , not even when his lordship suggested it was time they left for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bride 's arm in a firm , solid grasp and allowed the others to precede them from the church . Heather , nervous and jittery with his hand at her elbow , would have preferred going out on Lord Hampton 's arm , but Brandon clearly had no intentions of letting her do so . His mastery over her had already begun and she knew that she would never again belong to herself . His possession of her was complete  --  except for perhaps her soul , but he would not stop until that too belonged to him . Much to her dismay , she was halted by the sudden refusal of her 76  | cape to be drawn with her up the aisle . Frantically she looked over her shoulder to see what was binding it , and Brandon turned his black scowl on her as she appeared to tug away from his unrelenting grasp . " Please , " she started in a quavery voice , lifting a hand to explain her seeming reluctance to move forward . His eyes went past her toward the garment caught on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went back to release it . Heather watched him nervously , clasping the Bible she held in both hands . Her palms were moist and her fingers twitched . She glanced at the gold band that stamped her as his . It was rather loose and slid around her finger easily . Just to look at it brought more fear to her heart , knowing what it would mean . Brandon detached the golden embroidery from the rough splinter and tossed the end of the cape over his arm in a careless manner and came back to her . Again his hand slid under her arm . " There 's no need to distress yourself , my love , " he said mockingly . " The garment is intact . " " Thank you , " she murmured softly , raising her eyes uncertainly to his . His taunting smile seared her and brought a rush of color to her face . He was cruelly laughing at her and her stung pride would not allow that . It brought her chin up defiantly . She glared at him through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man you would not smirk so easily , " she spat , hating him . He raised a finely arched eyebrow and chuckled unmercifully at her . " Were you a man , my dear , you would n't be in this situation . " Her blush deepened . Infuriated and seething with anger and humiliation , she tried to wrench free from his long fingers but he only tightened them around her arm . " You can not escape me again , my beauty , " he said easily , seeming to enjoy her distress . " You are now forever and for always mine . Marriage with me is what you wanted and that is what you shall have for the rest of your life  --  unless by chance you are widowed . But do not fear , love , I have no desire to leave you too soon . " Her face turned ashen under his careless gibe , and she swayed on her feet , feeling faint . He steadied her by drawing her near , and he raised her chin so he could gaze down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green fire . " Not even your Lord Hampton will be able to save you from me now , though I see he will try . But what is one night in many ? " 77  | The words sent a quivery spasm of fright rushing through her body , and her head fell back weakly against his arm . " What a beauty you are , my sweet , " he said huskily . " I sha n't grow tired of you too soon . " Lord Hampton , tense and nervous at their long delay with coming from the church , could not wait a moment longer . He hurried back in to find Heather clutched in her husband 's arms , her head thrown back , her eyes closed , her face very pale . " Has she fainted ? " he asked anxiously , coming to them . The fire in Brandon 's eyes died and he glanced at the smaller man briefly . " No , " he replied and returned his gaze to his wife . " She will be better in a moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The carriage is waiting . " He turned and left them , and Brandon 's arm tightened around his wife . " Shall I carry you , my love , " he asked mockingly , an evil jeering grin twisting his handsome mouth . Heather 's eyes flew open . " No ! " she cried , flinging herself from him in a sudden burst of pride and energy . His laugh straightened her spine even more . With a toss of her head she walked from him , but he still held her train over his arm and , she came up short when the extra length ran out . She glanced back audaciously and glared at him when he would not release it . The corner of his mouth went up scornfully as he came to her side again . " Your escape is impossible , my love . I have a very possessive nature . " " Then bed me here if you must , " she hissed , hate giving virulence to her tongue . " But do it quickly , for the others wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , " he said , taking her arm . " I shall take my pleasure of you slowly and at my leisure . Now come , for as you say , the others wait . " Outside the church , they were met by a shower of wheat . Sparse as the wedding party was , Lady Hampton would not let the simple custom go undone . Later they moved to the waiting carriage . Aunt Fanny was silent with the Yankee so near . Uncle John , hesitant and unsure of himself , helped Lady Hampton down the steps of the cathedral and her husband , Lord Hampton , hung back , watching Captain Birmingham assist his young bride . Uncle John handed his wife and Lady Hampton into the carriage and climbed in after them . As Heather drew near she found the three squeezed together on one side , Lady Hampton suffering greatly by 78  | being in the middle . The poor woman 's complaints went unuttered however , and permitting herself a small smile after all that she had been through , Heather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was greatly surprised when she found herself being slung up in her husband 's arms and placed aboard . Without thanking him for embarrassing her , she sank down on the vacant seat and gave him a withering glare which he could not see . He climbed in and threw his weight down beside her , and she was squeezed unmercifully when Lord Hampton got in also . To allow herself more room she tried to sit up on the edge of the seat , but she found herself unable to move because her husband was sitting on her skirt . She glanced up at him , but he was staring out the window and the muscles in the side of his face were tense with anger . An unintelligible , cowardly murmur escaped her lips as she pushed back against the seat again , fear catching at her heart . Their bodies were so close , his shoulder overlapped hers and the back of his arm rubbed against her breast . The full length of her thigh was pressed to the granite-hard muscles of his . As the chaise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to converse with Lord and Lady Hampton although they were just as tense as she . Her tone was almost inaudible when she spoke and cracked with nervousness . To save face she soon fell silent , afraid to trust her voice any longer . The ride seemed endless . They were jostled and bounced and Heather wondered frantically if any bone in her body would be left unbroken . Though Lord Hampton was not a big man , he was still larger than she and between her husband , whose tall broad-shouldered frame gave no inch , and his lordship 's , she , being much smaller than the two , endured much . The pressure of Brandon 's arm against her breast alone was sending her into a state of shock . Finally the carriage drew up before Hampshire Hall . Brandon descended first and with capable hands reached up , clasped her under the arms and swung her down beside him . She straightened her clothes with a jerk and flung her long train over her arm with an arrogant toss of her head . Inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to her displeasure , was helped by her husband who unfastened the gold chains from her shoulders . His long fingers worked with great dexterity . The wedding feast was already laid upon the table when they entered the dining room . Lord and Lady Hampton took their places at the ends of the table and motioned for Heather and Brandon to sit on  | one side , Uncle John and Aunt Fanny on the other . They lifted their glasses in toast to the young couple . " To a most happy and rewarding marriage despite what has here before taken place , " his lordship offered . Then he added as an afterthought , " And may the child be a fine boy . " A red glow spread over Heather 's features as she lifted her glass to her lips . But she did not drink . She would not hope for a boy and give this man more confidence in himself . She noticed , however , that he drank the champagne down quite easily , and she eyed him distastefully . The meal went too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time they left the table it was past the hour of eleven . The men took their brandies into the drawing room as Lady Hampton propelled Aunt Fanny off to her sleeping quarters and drew Heather to the bedchamber prepared for her and the Yankee . Two giggly young maids were waiting for the young bride , and a night garment of transparent filmy blue cloth lay on the bed . Heather blanched white at the sight of it , but Lady Hampton led her to a bench in front of a huge mirror and pressed her down into it . " I shall return with some wine when you 're ready , " the woman murmured , kissing Heather 's brow . " Perhaps it will help . " As the maid drew her bridal gown from her and uncoiled her hair , Feather knew nothing would protect her from her fear . She would have to be unconscious before she would not quake with fright . " I might as well be a virgin , " she thought with some surpise , " as much as I tremble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left loose and flowing , reaching down to her hips . Her clothes were taken away  --  not even a robe was left  --  and Heather , sitting on her heels in the middle of the bed and wearing only a gown of gossamer to veil her nakedness , tried to still her trembling body and calm herself for the ordeal that was to come . Outside the bedroom , footsteps clicked against the marble floors , but she breathed a sigh of relief . They belonged to a woman . Lady Hampton opened the door and came in , carrying a tray bearing a wine decanter and two glasses . She set it down upon a table beside the bed and poured Heather a glass as she inspected the work the girls had done . She nodded with approval . " You are even more beautiful now , my dear , than you were in your bridal gown , impossible though it may seem . You were a vision . I felt so proud . I just wish there would have been more time to invite guests . 80  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told them you were my own sweet . How I grieve that your mother died so soon and never knew you . She would have been proud of you . " " Proud of me ? " Heather asked forlornly , looking down at her stomach . " I 've brought disgrace to you all , " she said tearfully . Lady Hampton smiled at her gently . " Nonsense , my dear . Sometimes a girl can not help the things that happen to her . She 's just a victim of circumstances . " " Or of Yankees , " Heather murmured . Her ladyship laughed softly . " Yes , or of Yankees , but at least he 's young and handsome and clean . When my husband first told me of your predicament and said a Yankee seaman was to blame , I was sick with worry . I thought he would be old and lecherous . Even your aunt confided that she expected the man to be so . It was probably a great disappointment to her that he was not , considering what you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Truly all your babies will be fine and beautiful and I suppose you 'll have many . " Lady Hampton 's voice dwindled off to barely a whisper as she remembered the passionate embrace Captain Birmingham had given his young bride and the rock hard expression that had been on his face afterward . " Yes , " Heather breathed silently . She swallowed hard and said aloud , " Yes , I suppose we 'll be having many . " She was thinking of the ease with which Brandon had planted his seed in her . She would no doubt be giving birth to many . Lady Hampton rose to go and Heather looked up pleadingly . " Must you go now ? " she asked in a quavery voice . The woman nodded her head slowly . " Yes , my dear . We 've held him at bay long enough . We can not any longer . But if you should need us , we will be near . " The woman 's meaning was not lost upon Heather . She knew if she called out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no right to interfere . Again she was alone and frightened . But after she had tasted bitterly her husband 's mockery , she was determined now not to cringe and cower from him . " Let him see that I am willing , " she thought cunningly . " He will not choose to hurt me then . " Her waiting came to an abrupt end , startling her when the sound of his footfalls came in the hall . Her face flamed as she saw the door open , and then she found herself staring across the width of the room 81  | into his green eyes . His gaze lowered and a fire was kindled as he raked her body with his stare . Heather sat awkwardly , her heart beating wildly . The bedcovers had been drawn to the end of the bed out of her reach and she longed to pull them to her . The gown she wore was like a soft blue veil over her body , more alluring and revealing than bare flesh . It was tied with soft ribbons at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the waist down it was slit with no further ornament to hold it together . As a result the sides of her breasts were exposed and the long , slender limbs were laid bare to his gaze . The hardest thing she ever had to do in her life was to sit calmly before him and let him look at her as he was doing . " You 're very beautiful , my love , " he said hoarsely , coming forward to the bed . His eyes were like flames of fire , scorching her . He reached out and pulled her to her knees . " You 're even more lovely than I remembered . " Still on her knees , she came reluctantly to him as he drew her into his embrace . His hands slid carelessly under her gown and over her buttocks as he bent his head slowly to her , and trembling , Heather waited for his kiss . But before his lips pressed upon hers , he drew away the slightest degree and laughed softly in his mocking way . " You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . Does marriage make it so different ? Was that the price you were selling your body for ? And here I thought at last was a woman pure in heart who would willingly give her body to no man for a price , only for love . " " Oh , you horrible wretch ! " she cried angrily , trying to snatch free . " What do I have to say in the matter ? You will rape me as you did before , whether I struggle or not . " " Be quiet , " he said quickly , jerking her closer and forcing her to be still . " Do you want the others to hear and break down the door ? Lord Hampton is just waiting for the invitation . " " What do you care ? " she taunted viciously . " You are stronger than he . What will it matter if you have to throw him out before you finish your business with me ? " A muscle twitched in Brandon 's cheek and already Heather knew that slight movement meant danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fierce and frigid . " I would n't assert my husbandly rights upon you tonight if you were the last woman in the world , " he sneered . Heather stopped struggling immediately and raised her eyes to his in surprise , wondering if she had heard him correctly . His eyelids  | lowered and his jeering grin reappeared , showing startling white teeth against the darkness of his skin and beard . " You heard right , my dear . I have no intention of making love to you in this house tonight . " He ignored the expression of relief on her face and went on . " When I take my pleasure of you , my love , it will be in my own way , in my own house or on my own ship , and not where another man is waiting anxiously to barge in and pull us apart , and certainly not when that man is holding an axe over my head . " " An axe ? " she repeated innocently , relaxing against him . " Do n't tell me you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not believe you were not in with them . " " I do n't know what you 're talking about , " she said cautiously . He laughed bitterly . " Always innocent , are n't you , sweet ? " His eyes dropped to her bosom and he ran his fingers over the side of her breast where the filmy gown left it bare . His thumb brushed her nipple underneath . " Always innocent , " he said softly . " Always beautiful . Always cold . " She allowed his hands to caress her . They were gentle and as long as nothing would follow and he was her husband , she would not take the chance to stir his anger by refusing him this much . But she persisted with her questioning . She wanted to know what axe they had used . " How did they make you marry me ? " she inquired softly . His lips touched her hair and moved to her throat and Heather shivered involuntarily at their burning intensity . His hand stroked her breast still and seemed not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would not keep his word . She reached and drew the bedcovers over her and sank down again in the middle of the bed . " Are you going to tell me ? " she whispered , staring at him . His mood was again mocking , cruel , angry . " Why should I ? You 've heard it all before . But if it matters so much to hear it from my lips I shall tell you . Your dear lordship was going to convict me of smuggling and selling arms to the French , despite the fact I 'm lily white . I would have been sent to prison , my ship taken from me , and God only knows what would have happened to my plantation back home . Very crafty of your friend , I must say . " He yanked off his coat and threw it into a chair and began untying his stock . " Do you know I am  --  or shall I say , I was engaged to be married when I returned home ? What am I supposed to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't help myself ? "  | He paused a moment , pulling his shirt from his brown shoulders . He gazed at her angrily . " I do n't like being forced , my dear . It goes against my grain . If you had come to me when you first learned of your pregnancy , I would have helped you . I may have even married you , if you had acted as if you desired marriage with me , but to send your mighty friend and threaten me , it was a most unwise thing for such a little girl to do . " Wide-eyed and fearful , Heather huddled under the sheet as if it would give her protection from his savage hands if he turned on her . He moved about the room , blowing out candles and she watched him cautiously . He had stripped to the waist and did not appear to have any thought of stopping there . But for the moment he settled down in a chair by the bed . " You know you 're very beautiful , do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could have had any man of your choosing , and yet you had to have me . I would like to know the truth , if you do n't mind . Did you perhaps learn that I have wealth ? " She looked at him strangely , seeing no need for him to ask . " I know nothing of your financial situation , " she replied softly . " You were just the man who  --  who took my virginity . I could n't go to another man , sullied as I was and with your child in me . I would have given birth to a bastard before stooping so low . " 1 " Your honorable nature is to be applauded , madam , " he said in a light , bantering tone , and his scoffing burned her . " Why should you have been allowed to go merrily upon your way and not made to right the wrong you did ? " she cried . He was beside her in an instant . " Please , my dear , " he said uneasily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll find ourselves with company . I have no desire to be thrown into prison by your Lord Hampton because he thinks I am mistreating you  --  especially since I 've already made you my wife . " His anxiety pleased her , but she went on in a hushed whisper . " You say you dislike force . Well , I loathe it , but I could do nothing to stop you from taking your pleasure of me . Now you 're angry because you 've had to pay the piper , yet you do not think of the child I carry ? what it might have suffered , born a bastard . " " The child would have been well cared for and so would you have been . " She laughed ungraciously . " As your bastard and your mistress ? No , thank you . I 'd have slit my throat before consenting to that proposal . " 84  | The tic in his cheek returned and he stared at her for such a long time she sat transfixed like a bird before a snake , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is kept by a man is usually better tended than his wife . I would have been kind and more than generous with you . " " Meaning you will not be now , " she said with sarcasm . " Exactly , " he answered smoothly , heartlessly terrifying her . He got up from the bed and stared down at her . " As I 've said , I do n't like being blackmailed , and for you I 've chosen a fitting punishment . You wanted security and a name for our child . You will have them , my dear  --  but you 'll not have one damned thing more . You 'll be hardly better than a servant in my home . You 'll have the name you wanted , but you 'll have to beg and plead to have me grant your slightest wish . You wo n't have any money nor will you lead a normal life , though I will be careful to save you the embarrassment of others knowing of your situation . In other words , my dear , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own special prison . You wo n't even share with me the more tender moments of marriage . You 'll be just another servant in my eyes . As my mistress you would have been treated as a queen , but you will now know me as master and nothing more . " " You mean we wo n't be  --  intimate ? " she asked with much surprise . " You 've caught on quickly , my love . And you need n't worry about me in that respect . I wo n't be cutting my own throat to spite my face . You 're only one woman among many , and for a man it is easy to find relief for his baser needs . " Heather sighed with the joy of the disburdened and smiled , gloating over her good fortune . " Sir , nothing could please me more , I assure you . " He sneered at her coldly . " Yes , I can see that you 're pleased now . But your hell has only begun , m'lady . I 'm not termed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foul temper which can snap up a small tart like you without a second notice . So be warned , my beauty . Do not tempt it . Tread lightly and perhaps you will survive . Do you understand ? " She nodded , no longer licking her lips over her blessings . " Now go to sleep . It will be some time before I 'm able to do the same . " Quick to obey , lest he should find fault with her so soon , she slid down into the bed with haste and drew the covers under her chin , watching him warily as he moved across the room to the balcony doors . He opened them and stepped out into the moonlight . Not tak-85  | ing her eyes from him , Heather turned on her side carefully so she would not draw his attention back to her . Again he had taken up the stance of a sailor looking out to sea and the moon touched on his handsome face and broad shoulders . His smooth , brown skin gleamed in its light , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awakened abruptly when Brandon fell back on the pillow beside her , and drugged with sleep , she thought he would do some harm to her . She sat up with a startled cry on her lips and flung up an arm as if to ward him off . But he caught it with a snarl and jerked her back to her pillow . " Be quiet , you little fool ! " he growled , leaning over her . " I had no intentions of spending the night in a chair and leaving you the bed . " A tremor of fright passed through her body as he held her down . He was just above her in the darkness and his warm breath touched her face . The moonlight streaming in from the balcony etched his angry profile . " I did n't mean to cry out , " she whispered fearfully . " I was just startled . " " For God 's sake , be startled some other time , " he snapped . " I have an aversion to prisons . " " Lord Hampton would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't ! Now that you have my name , your honor is restored , but if he thought he acted unwisely in giving you to me , he would go ahead with his threat and toss me into prison just to keep me from you . So despite what you feel about me , if you want our child to grow up with a father , please do n't offer him any encouragement . " " I had n't intended to , " she replied in a whisper . " You could n't have proved it by me , " he retorted . " Oh , you ! " she hissed , trying to struggle free from his grasp . " Why was I so unlucky to be put upon by you ! You 're  --  you 're abominable ! " He laughed softly as he held her down . " Some women would n't agree with you , my dear . " " Oh , you cad ! " she panted breathlessly . " You vile , uncouth , loathsome rapist  --  defiler of women ! I loathe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lean , hard body immensely threatening to her small frame , and gave her a quick , silencing , bone-breaking squeeze . " Be careful , my beauty , or you will find yourself with your hands full . I can stop your screams quite easily . It will not discomfort me in the least to act the husband . " 86  | She gasped with pain as his grip tightened again , and Heather thought she would be crushed in his brutal arms . She felt his thighs against her own quaking , cowardly limbs and realized that she was the only one even partially clothed . But the gown was little comfort . It was wound around her waist and bared a breast whose fullness was now crushed to his chest . There was no question to his desires . " Please , " she whimpered as his hold became more harrowing . " I will be good . Do not hurt me so . " His deep chuckle made a shiver of fright pass through her body as he continued to hold her , then quite suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Go to sleep . I wo n't bother you . " She drew the covers under her chin with quivering fingers and curled on her side facing him , shaking uncontrollably . The moonlight made the room bright and she saw that his eyes were open and he lay flat on his back with his hands under his head , staring up at the ceiling . Even in the dimness of the room she thought she saw his cheek vibrate with rage . " Where is your home ? " she questioned softly , a long while later . He sighed heavily . " Charleston of the Carolinas . " " Is it very beautiful there ? " she ventured again . " To me it is . You may not like it , " he replied stiffly . She dared not ask more of what was to be her home . She had braved enough as it was . A chilling breeze came through the opened balcony doors and woke her at the first break of dawn . At just awakening , she was out of sorts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon became aware of the man she pressed to for warmth . Her left hand lay across his chest over the crisp , dark hair covering it , and her cheek rested against his sturdy shoulder . He slept soundly , his face turned slightly toward her , relaxed in slumber . Not moving for fear of awakening him , she studied him at her leisure . Her eyes traced the firm , straight mouth , now softened with sleep , and the long , dark lashes which lay on brown cheeks . " He is a handsome man , " she thought . " Perhaps it would not be so bad to have a son like him . " He stirred slightly and turned his face away , leaving her to stare at the back of his rumpled head and the broad expanse of his chest where her hand lay . She gazed at the ring on her third finger and marveled at the brightness of the gold . It looked strange on her hand and what was even more odd was the way she suddenly felt . The thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with new realization . It was something he had said the day before  --  forever and for always she would be his . And now she mused : " Even in eternity I will belong to him . " Very slowly and carefully , so as not to awaken him , she drew the covers on his chest , but she soon realized her mistake with thinking him chilled . It did n't take long for him to kick the covers away corn- 1 pletely , making her blush profusely . His body lay bare to her gaze now , but she did not turn away though her face flamed with her own temerity . Instead she let her eyes roam over him slowly and with much interest , satisfying her curiosity . There was no need of others to tell her what she could see herself ? that he was magnificently made , like some wild , grand beast of the forests . Long , flexible muscles were superbly conditioned , his belly flat and hard , his hips narrow . Her hand , slim and white , appeared out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the strange stirring within her , she eased from him and moved toward her side of the bed . She turned away , trying not to think how her eyes had lingered on his body , and she saw a leaf fall to the floor of the balcony . She huddled under the covers , wishing she were as warm-blooded as the man beside her . The mantel clock had long before struck nine chimes when the two 10gly girls returned to dress her . They rapped on the wood lightly and she heard their snickering through the door . It maddened her and brought a bright flush of color to her face as she slid from the bed . She glanced back over her shoulder at her husband and found him still asleep and undraped . Very cautiously she went around the bed and pulled the sheet up carefully over his nakedness . He awakened instantly , startling her so much she jumped . She drew back her hands as if she had just touched fire and went a few shades redder as his gaze swept her , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its even more revealing slits . A slow , amused smile curved III his lips and made her tremble , and she turned uncertainly and went to the door , knowing his eyes followed her . The two twittering , sniggering maids came in together , one carrying a tray of food . They glanced about the room curiously as though they expected to see some secrets of the night before unfolded in front of their eyes . Seeing Brandon propping himself up on the pillows with only a sheet drawn up over his lap , they were sent into renewed giggles . He chuckled with amusement at their nervousness , but Heather desired greatly to give each a pinch , especially when they kept right on staring at her husband with such a hungry look in their eyes , giving 88  | her to wonder if they were so chaste as their fidgeting implied . They went together to the bedside to show him the great assortment of food on the tray , and Heather waited impatiently as they cooed over him , spreading a napkin over his lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of all this , his eyes lifted to her own bright , angry face and mocked her , and she turned away smoldering . Finally the maidservants remembered their duties and returned to attend her , preparing a rose-scented bath and laying out her bridal gown again , it being the only gown she possessed . Under the interested and observing eyes of her husband , they stripped the blue veil from her and helped her into the bath . Their giggling did not cease as they scrubbed her back and arms , but when they began to wash her shoulders and bosom , she could not endure it any longer . She snatched the sponge and soap from their hands impatiently and snapped at them to leave her be . She immediately regretted not being more tolerant when Brandon laughed at her with mirth , throwing his splendid head up high with his glee . She glowered at him , feeling intense hatred rise up once more within her . But she did not dare hiss the words at him she wished to , fearing he would silence her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would not give the two skinny , homely girls the satisfaction of knowing she and the handsome beast were anything but newly wedded and in love . Rising from the tub in shimmery wet splendor , she allowed them once more to assist her , standing motionless as they patted her body dry under Brandon 's unrelenting gaze . He watched with such a slow , unhurried regard that her skin burned from its intensity . She was more than willing to don her shift though its transparency and immodest decolletage were hardly very comforting . As they brushed and combed her hair , she found herself as fidgety as the young girls , and she cursed herself silently for allowing Brandon 's appraisal to make her nervous . But it was almost more than she could bear to have him lounging back against the satin pillows watching her , and the two servants seemed to take forever doing her hair . When they stepped back to compliment each other on their artistry , she breathed a sigh of relief . But her short lived comfort came to an abrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bed and stood up , dragging the sheet with him . He managed deftly to wrap it around him without revealing more of himself to the girls , and he came to her , holding the sheet around his narrow hips . He dropped a kiss on one round breast just above the lace of her shift . " A rewarding experience , my love , " he murmured easily . " I must 89  | admit I 've never had the honor before of being present at a lady 's toilette . " For a moment their eyes met in the mirror , his warm and devouring , hers nervous and uncertain . But under his openly admiring regard , she flushed crimson and dropped her eyes to her lap , still feeling the brush of his lips upon her breast and the strange tremor which they had evoked . She heard his soft laugh and then he turned and made a show of kissing each maid 's hand , and he might as well have been fully garmented the way he acted . He was completely at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done well , my ladies , " he purred to them . " My wife is greatly appreciative . " The two almost swooned , never having such a thing happen to them before and certainly never by such a fine specimen of a man . They fell against each other giggling unceasingly and ran to ready his bath . When they finally left the room , Heather sprang up from the bench and flounced angrily to the bed for her dress . " What need was there for that ? " she snapped . " They should have been severely reprimanded for the way they acted , and you only encouraged them to be worse . " He smiled slowly , his gaze moving appreciatively over her back . " I 'm sorry , my love . I was n't aware that you were so jealous . " ? Her blue eyes flashing , Heather spun around in a rage , prepared to send a string of insults flying at his head , but Brandon only laughed and dropped the sheet to the floor . " Attend to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching my back . " She could do nothing but splutter and spew and turn a bright red . His odious manner riled her blood to the boiling point . Yet as he was , standing unclothed before her and daring her to speak with amused patience , she had to back down . She could not stand and curse him for the wretch he was , when both of them were conscious first of all of his nakedness . He waited for her answer in a relaxed stance , hands on hips , one knee bent and slightly forward . She hated him for his coolness , his mocking gaze , but she would not call him names . Holding her teeth clenched tight , she brushed past him and picked up the sponge and soap and waited for him to get in the tub , her back as rigid as stone . She heard his amused chuckle and she gritted her teeth more . Then he was easing into the tub of hot water in front of her . She hesitated but a moment over his back , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to lather the soap over it . She scrubbed hard , venting her anger into the strokes she used . But when she had gladly concluded that task , he just grinned . " You 're not finished , pet . I would like to be washed all over . " " All over ? " she squeaked weakly , incredulously . " Of course , sweet . I 'm very lazy . " She damned him with unuttered words , knowing he was making her bathe him because it satisfied his need for vengeance . His excuse of being lazy was meant only to flaunt his mastery over her . He was most aware that having to touch him in any way was agony for her , and he had chosen the intimate chore of bathing him as punishment . She 'd have gladly taken a beating rather than to do it and he knew this well . Despising him , she jerked up the sponge again and bent to her task as he leaned back in the tub . She ran the soap through the mat of hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face burning under his casual scrutiny . His unflinching stare caressed her white arms , the long , slender neck , and finally her bosom whose beauty was revealed even more as she worked over him , exposing part of one round breast . " Did you have someone you were fond of in your uncle 's village ? " he asked suddenly , a frown wrinkling his brow . " No , " she said sharply ; then rebuked herself for not being more cunning . The frown vanished . He ran a wet finger across her breasts and smiled . " I 'm sure there were many who were smitten with you . " Angrily she snatched her shift up high over her bosom and rubbed it against her flesh where the water trickled down between her breasts . When she let go again , the garment returned to its place , now quite damp . " There were a few , but you need n't worry . They were n't like you . They were gentlemen . " " I 'm not worried at all , my pet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarded . " " Yes , " she retorted sarcastically . " That is , from everybody but you . " He chuckled and swept her again with his burning gaze . " It was my pleasure , sweet . " She went livid with rage . " I suppose it pleases your male ego too , to have me breeding now ! You must surely be proud of yourself ! " His grin was mocking . " I 'm not displeased . I happen to like babies . " " Oh , you  --  you  --  " she sputtered , seething . 91  | The grin was gone with frightening speed . " Finish attending your husband 's bath , my dear , " he said sarcastically . She choked off a sob and squeezed the sponge out over his knee . There was nothing left to wash now but the lower half of his body , and she could not bring herself to be that familiar with him . Tears sparkled in her long lashes and fell from her cheeks . " I ca n't , " she murmured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently . His gaze went deep into her eyes . " If I choose , you know you will do it , do n't you ? " he asked softly . She closed her eyes in agony and nodded her head . " Yes , " she whispered miserably , tears falling freely now . His hand caressed her fragile cheek . " Gather my clothes then , will you , sweet ? I 'm sure everyone is waiting to see how you have fared . " She went gladly and collected his clothes from about the room , more than grateful because he had been lenient with her . It would be a long time before she 'd dare call him names again or flare up in anger at him . She would have to remember he disliked insolence and would not stand for it . She had been effectively disciplined and would do his will as an obedient wife . Cowardly she was , and she had n't the nerve to do anything else . When they left the bedroom , she walked beside him silently , completely docile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand behind her back to her waist and glanced down at her . In the drawing room the two older couples waited anxiously , though Aunt Fanny for an entirely different reason . She was hoping for the worst , but she frowned blackly as her niece came in seeming at ease with the man beside her . His lordship went to Heather immediately and embraced her . " You 're looking radiant as always , my child , " he said with relief in his voice . " Did you expect anything else , my Lord ? " Brandon asked coldly . Lord Hampton laughed softly . " Do not hold a grudge against me , my son . To me , Heather 's happiness comes first . " " Yes , you 've made that abundantly clear . Now , will I be allowed to take her to my ship today or must we again have your hospitality forced upon us ? " In good spirits , his lordship was not easily vexed . By all means , take her with my good blessings . But first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ? It 's not a command , but an invitation . If 92  | you 're not so inclined , we will understand . It 's just that we hate to see Heather go . She 's like our own child . " " I suppose it will do no harm to stay , " Brandon answered stiffly . " But I must get back to my ship soon after . I 've been away too long as it is . " " Of course . Of course . We understand . But I desired to talk with you about Heather 's dowry . We are prepared to settle the matter ourselves  --  generously . " " I wish nothing from you , sir . " His reply drew shocked attention and most of all from Heather . His lordship stared at the Yankee captain for a moment , completely baffled . " Did I hear you correctly , sir ? " " You did , " Brandon said formally . " I have no intentions of taking payment for marrying my wife . " " But it 's expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband some form of dowry . I am more than willing ? " " The dowry she will bring is the child she is carrying , nothing more . I 'm quite capable of taking care of my own without gifts . Just the same , thank you for the offer . " Heather closed her mouth and moved to sit down , feeling more than stunned . " Crazy Yankee , " Aunt Fanny muttered . Brandon clicked his heels together and bowed formally before her . " From you , madam , that is truly a compliment . " She glared at him and made as if to sneer an insult but thought better of the idea , much to her credit . Instead , she clamped her mouth shut and jerked her face away from his mocking gaze . " As you are well aware , madam , " he said to her back , " what I say is true . I do take care of my own  --  and their debts . " The meaning of what he said was lost upon Heather , but Fanny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at him . She was still silent when a servant came to announce that luncheon . was served .  | A cold October thunderstorm had washed the autumn air and left the day with occasional squalls chasing themselves across London . The wheels clattered over the cobblestones and splashed through mud holes as the landau lurched and jolted its way toward the docks . Heather sat quietly by Lady Hampton in the rear seat . The woman spoke softly to her and now and then smoothed a glossy black curl lovingly , or lightly touched her hand . It was the only indication of nervousness displayed despite the sorrow of the approaching moment . But often Heather 's eyes were drawn hesitantly to the stoical face of her husband who sat beside Lord Hampton across from her . He was *braced in the corner against the bumps and his eyes moved slowly and impassively about the carriage , falling on her for a moment then sliding away with the same ease with which they had touched her . Lord Hampton made sporadic attempts to engage him in conversation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sake of politeness . The carriage made a careening turn and swept down a narrow waterfront street , crossed an open muddy court , and drew up in the lee of a building . A small sign rattled and clapped above a door , labeling the structure : Charleston Enterprises Warehouse . Brandon stepped lightly from the carriage and turned to Heather . " You 'll have several moments to say your farewells . I must have the warehouse agent signal my ship for a lighter . " With this he strode away , the wind ruffling his close-cropped hair and the lace at his cuffs . Heather 's gaze followed him into the building , then she slowly turned to Lady Hampton and found tears brimming in the woman 's eyes . Their parting sorrows could no longer be withheld . She fell into the woman 's arms and through their tears their hearts communed  --  a motherless girl , a childless woman . Lord Hamp-94  | ton rather hoarsely cleared his throat . It was a brief moment 's passing before Heather sat upright again and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , " he comforted . " It is the way of the world that few partings are forever . Who knows when our paths may meet once more and we might share another moment of life . Take care , my child . Take very special care . " Impulsively Heather hugged his neck and brushed his leathery cheek with her lips . " Wo n't you please come and see me again before we sail ? " she pleaded . " No , we must n't , Heather . Your husband 's ire has been strained enough . It 's best we bid farewell here . Perhaps he will later forgive us , but for now , God speed , my very own . " She threw her arms around Lady Hampton again . " I 'll miss you both , " she gasped , tears flowing freely . Her ladyship clasped the girl firmly to her . " You will have your husband , my love , and soon a child . You 'll have precious little time to think of us . But something tells me you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now go , my dear . Go seek your angry man . And Heather  --  remember that anger and love are but a whit apart . " Reluctantly Heather drew from Lady Hampton 's embrace and moved to the door of the landau . She heard her husband 's voice just outside as he spoke briskly to a lounging tar , and she realized he had returned and was now standing by the horses waiting for her . Brushing the tears from her face , she opened the door and lifted her skirts to descend from the carriage . Brandon hurried to assist her and slid his hands to her waist . Their eyes met , and for once , thankfully , he did not mock her tears . He lifted her down gently , then reached into the carriage as Lord Hampton handed him their cloaks and the small bundle of gifts from Lady Hampton . She moved away as he spoke in a low voice to the Hamptons . The Fleetwood stood out in open harbor several hundred yards from the dock awaiting her turn at loading . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , four deckhands straining at the oars . A small , elderly , somewhat agitated man stood in the stern , urging them on , no doubt with colorful phrases . Closer around her the dock was alive in a chaos of sound , sight and smell . Idle sailors loafed about with the stench of the prior evening 's revelries still upon them , and drab , unwashed strumpets quite boldly hawked their wares , hoping to make a shilling or two or an evening 's bed and board . A group of rats squealed stridently over garbage in the open gutter , then fled as a rock flung by an urchin thumped among 95  | them . Shrill laughter rang as several unwashed ragamuffins skittered across the dock , leaped over the gutter and disappeared in an alleyway . Heather shuddered , remembering how she had thought of giving birth to a bastard and letting him grow up knowing this life of the streets . At least now the child would have an existence above this . What did it matter that she was neither loved nor wanted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of a home despite having a sire who sailed the sea . This was the life of a merchant captain this squalid , filthy scene around her and that small ship yonder . What part she would play in her husband 's life she did not know as yet , only that she would be the mother of his child . Whether he took her with him on other voyages in the future or left her conveniently behind was his decision and one in which she would have little or no say . But as she faced the wind that brought the scent of the sea to her nostrils , so she must face life  --  head on , taking whatever small pleasure her husband allowed her and being content . In time , perhaps , she would not care that love had passed her by . At the touch of her husband 's hand on her back , Heather 's thoughts fled swiftly . He had come with a noiseless tread , startling her . Feeling , tier slight body quiver , Brandon drew his cloak over her shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he murmured . Taking her arm , he guided her through stacks of cargo , coiled ropes and nets as the whaleboat approached the end of the pier . When the craft first touched the dock , the small man leaped ashore and scurried to meet them . He snatched the round stock cap from his head , and Heather realized with a start that it was George , her husband 's cabin boy and manservant . The man bowed in a jerky manner and addressed his master . " We thought you were to come back yesterday , cap'n . We almost give you up for lost . I was about to form up the hands and beat through the city for you thinkin ' you 'd fallen ill to the ' pressment gangs . You give us quite a worry , cap'n . " And with a bob and hardly a pause . " Hello , mum . " " We were detained at Lord Hampton 's for a bit , " Brandon replied . 11 With a nod and another jerky bob , George resettled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bundles and walked behind as they proceeded to the boat . Brandon descended first to the craft , then swung his young bride down beside him and settled her in the bow .  | George tossed him the bundles and painter , slid down the ladder , assumed his place in the stem and set the tiller . " Look lively , mates , " he demanded . " We 're under way now . Push off . Port oars awash , not stroke , lads  --  stroke  --  stroke . Now both and bend your backs to it , lads . ' Twill be a cold enough journey for the mum yet we drag it out . So hump , laddies , make it good . " The small craft slid beneath the stern of a moored merchantman and headed out across open water to the Fleetwood . There was a light chop rolling before the breeze and a chill spray of water struck Heather 's face , snatching her breath and sending a cold shiver through her . She pulled Brandon 's cloak tightly about her and huddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived , however , for the elements combined in a concerted effort to effect renewed discomfort . The whaleboat 's prow broke the back of each wave , swung high then slid down into the trough . The unaccustomed motion upset Heather 's stomach , and each new plunge seemed to raise her gorge a bit higher . She cast an uneasy glance to her husband who sat with his face into the wind , seeming to enjoy the feel of the salt spray , and pressed her hand to the base of her throat . " If I retch now , I 'll hate myself forever , " she thought wildly . Her knuckles grew white but her face gradually assumed the greenish shade of the sea . Her battle was nearly won , yet as they drew near the ship , she raised her eyes to the tall masts , lurching back and forth above her in direct opposition to the motions she felt . A miserable groan escaped her lips at the confusion of movement and drew Brandon 's immediate attention . He looked for one brief moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggling for control and acted swiftly . Sliding his arm around in front of her , he lowered her head carefully over the gunwale and let nature resolve itself in the sea . A few moments later Heather gave a last shudder and straightened , loathing herself . Shamed and humiliated , she dared not raise her eyes . Beside her , Brandon wet a handkerchief and pressed it to her brow . " Are you feeling better now ? " he asked gently . The motion had died away and the craft now stood in the lee of the ship . She managed a weak nod as George eased the boat against the curved belly of the barque . As Brandon secured the bow painter on the chains the older man did likewise aft . The captain then braced his foot on the ladder and turning , gestured to Heather . " Come , ma petite , I 'll help you aboard . " She came cautiously and made to set her foot on the ladder beside 97  | his . His arm went about her and , taking her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck of his ship . He set her down and for a moment his attention returned to the whaleboat , leaving Heather to gaze about . She found herself standing at the bottom of a seemingly confused tangle of ropes , cables and spars , and through them all , the great , raked masts lunged skyward , now swaying with a soft , gentle rhythm against the clouds . From the bowels of the ship came an almost musical squeaking , creaking and groaning . The tempo of sound and motion matched and almost made the ship a living , breathing thing beneath her . It had a clean , salty smell , and as she looked she realized each item was neatly in its place , ropes coiled at hand , pins and buckets stowed . A sense of order lay about the ship . Brandon returned to her side . " You will need to change your gown , Heather . I purchased a few things for you before I found you had disappeared . They 're in my cabin . " And with a mocking eyebrow raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . " She blushed profusely and glanced hesitantly toward one of the doors beneath the quarter-deck . " Yes , I can see that you do , " he murmured , watching her . " You will find the clothes in my trunk . I will be along in a moment . " So dismissed , she moved away from him to the door . Before she opened it , however , her gaze went back for one brief moment to her husband and found him deep in conversation with George . It seemed he had already forgotten her . The cabin was as she remembered it , compact and small , occupying as little of the precious cargo space as possible . The day 's dreariness 41 made it a deep twilight within as only soft hazy light came from the windows at the stern . Before she moved to the trunk she lit a candle on the table and hung her husband 's cloak on a peg by the door . Then she knelt before the trunk and her fingers touched the latch and lifted the lid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gown neatly folded on top . Memories came flooding back , reminding her of William Court and of the night spent in this very cabin . Her eyes were drawn reluctantly to the bunk where she had lost her virginity and she gazed at it for a moment , remembering the struggles that had taken place there , the passionate and fiery lips against her flesh , and lastly of the defeat . Her hand slid to her belly with a will of its own and her face burned . She started when the door behind her opened and Brandon walked in . Hastily she pushed tho beige dress aside and pulled out a deep red 98  | velvet gown that was beneath . It possessed a neckline cut low , and sleeves , fitted and long , trimmed with white lace at the wrists . It was a gown made for a woman with no childish affectations to mar its simplicity and beauty . As Brandon pulled his coat off and threw it on the bunk , she rose and began unfastening her gown with trembling fingers . She stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunk . " There 's an inn nearby , " said her husband behind her . " It will be more comfortable for you there than it is here . " A small frown touched her brow as she turned and looked at him . He had unbuttoned his shirt and was already engrossed in his ledgers at his desk . As easily as he dismissed her from his ship could he dismiss her from his mind . Perhaps he would even leave her behind when he sailed . There was no guarantee that he would not , and she would be left destitute . " I am not unaccustomed to discomfort , " she replied in a soft voice . " I will be content to stay here . You need not take me to an inn . " He glanced up at her . " You are very agreeable , my love , " he flung with a short , scornful laugh . " But it is I who make the decisions here . The inn will be more suitable to your needs . " She had not thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind . She felt a coldness begin to grow in the depth of her body . " Is this truly to be my fate ? " she wondered forlornly . " To be left on the waterfront to fare as I might in childbirth at the hands of midwives who know nothing more than filth and squalor ? Is my son to have a name and still to live his life as an urchin in a gutter ? " She turned and a shiver of apprehension went through her . Was there no mercy in this man ? If he wanted her to beg , she would gladly go down on her knees before him and plead for her child 's life . But he did not seem to want that . He had made up his mind coldly and without emotion . She was to go to an inn . Trying to calm her fears , she drew the red gown up over her shoulders and went to where he sat . His attention fell on her and a strange expression crossed his face . The deep rich color of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midnight blue , and the flawless skin shone startling white against the red . Her bosom was generously and beautifully displayed , the gown barely covering the pinkness at its peaks . Terribly afraid and unsure of how he would react to doing this small labor for her , Heather turned her back to him . 99  | " I 'm not able to fasten it , " she murmured softly as her stomach fluttered and her consternation grew . " Do you mind ? " She felt his fingers on the back of the gown , and she bent her head forward and waited , scarcely breathing , until he finished , then she moved away , casting an uncertain glance over her shoulder at him as she did . He was again studying the books , but now there was a black scowl on his face . As she went quietly about the room , putting her bridal cape away , gathering the clothes she would need at the inn , and hanging his discarded coat on a peg inside his locker , she eyed him covertly , fearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he seemed absorbed in his books and oblivious to her . The time dragged slowly and silently by . There was only a moment 's respite when George brought coffee and tea . But he served his captain with hardly a murmur and brought the tea to her where she sat in the gallery behind her husband 's chair . Then the servant was gone again , leaving her to listen to the gentle sighing of the ship and the dull thud of her heart . The time was nearly ten of the hour when Brandon pushed his chair from the desk and looked at her once more . His eyes dropped to her bosom and he frowned again . " You had better wear my cloak to the inn , " he said brusquely . " I ' have no desire to be waylaid once we 're ashore by some petty whoremonger who thinks you 'll bring him a pretty price . " The color flew to Heather 's face and her eyes fell from his gaze . She murmured an obedient answer , slid from the cushions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few moments later they were in the boat waiting for George to descend . The servant dropped her bundle and a duffel bag to the boat , then climbed down and gave orders to the sailors to push off . On shore he walked behind them , looking cautiously over his shoulders for would-be thieves or other dangerous characters . They arrived at the inn without incident and entered to the strains of a melancholy tune a sailor was singing . The man was small and thinly fleshed , but his voice was a full baritone of gentle touch . Near him , a few men sat quaffing ale and listening , enthralled by the magic of his voice . A fire crackled in the hearth and an aroma of roast pig rose into the air , making Heather 's mouth water . She closed her eyes and tried not to think of the hunger that gnawed at her stomach . Brandon murmured something to George and the servant went off quickly to talk with the innkeeper as Heather followed her husband to ? ill I 100  | a table in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her , and a moment later they were being served food and drink which Heather accepted gratefully as her stomach growled for nourishment . She did not notice the stares she drew from the men nor the cloak slipping away from her shoulders nor two seedy-looking men who sat across the room from them talking in low whispers to one another . Her attention was divided between her food and listening to the song of " Greensleeves " the tar was singing . With a start she felt her husband lean over her . He drew the cloak again over her shoulders and her face flamed as she lifted her eyes to his . " I bought the gown for my private admiration , my love , " he said softly . " I did n't mean to have you pleasure other men with the sight of your lovely bosom . It is not wise to do so either . You are causing a stir among these men . " Heather pulled the cloak together and glancing about cautiously , she realized what he said was true . She seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing for a moment as he gazed at her . Shortly he began again . Black is the color of my true love 's hair Her looks are something wondrous fair , The purest eyes and the softest hands I love the grass on where she stands I love my love and well she knows , I love the grass on where she goes . If she on earth no more could stay My life would quickly pass away . Heather glanced at her husband and saw that he was irritated with the sailor 's song . His eyelids had lowered over his eyes as he attended his meal , but in his cheek a small muscle twitched . As before , she grew silent and fearful when she sensed his anger . After dinner , the innkeeper showed them to the room for which George had made arrangements . The servant carried the bundles in , then removed himself with the innkeeper . For a few moments Heather waited for Brandon to leave also , never to be seen again , but he lounged in a chair and seemed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had him unfasten her gown , and she began to undress as if she expected him to stay . She took down her hair and ran her fingers through it to smooth the curls because she possessed no brush or comb . Aware of her husband 's eyes on her , she slipped out of her 101  | gown and shift and laid them over a chair and donned a nightdress Lady Hampton had given her . The gown was of a thin white batiste with inserts of lace over the bosom , and a neckline cut round and very low . Beneath the breasts a narrow ribbon was drawn through lace and tied . The sleeves were full and long and a ruffle edged with lace fell over her hands . Though less filmy than the gown of her wedding night , this one , like the other , was meant to give a man pleasure , but as she moved in front of a candle 's glow , it brought an angry oath from Brandon 's lips . Heather glanced up with a start to see him striding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour or two , " he growled , opening the door . Then he was gone and Heather sank to the floor as tearful , frightened sobs choked her . " He can not even speak the truth , " she gasped . " Ile will never return . " Each moment then that passed was longer than the one before . She paced the floor , wondering what she was to do and where she was to go . She could not go again to her aunt 's and allow her child to grow up under the woman 's hateful hand , nor could she go to Lord Hampton and ask him to help her . She had too much pride to cast her troubles upon them again . Perhaps if life were merciful she would find work as a maid here at the inn . She would ask tomorrow , but for the night she would sleep if she could . The night aged and try though Heather may to calm her fears and push her doubts aside , sleep did not come . It seemed an eternity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one . With a cry she jumped from the bed and ran to the window to slam it closed . She dropped her head against its frame and her slender shoulders shook with sobs . Just outside her door she heard a man 's voice and another in reply . Her fear doubled , and when the door opened , the color drained from her face . But the light in the hall touched on George 's face and silhouetted her husband 's tall , broad-shouldered frame . " You came back ! " she breathed . His face turned her way before he closed the door and they were again lost in blackness . " Why are n't you in bed ? " he asked , moving in the darkness toward the bed . There was a scratch of flint and steel . The tinder caught and he lit a candle on the table then looked at her . " Are you ill ? " She came toward him from the shadows and the candlelight made the tears sparkle in her eyes . " I thought you had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never see you again . " 102  | For a moment he gazed at her with some surprise , then he smiled gently and drew her near . " And you were frightened ? " She nodded her head piteously and tried to choke back a sob but it ended sounding like a hoarse croak . He brushed her hair from her face tenderly and touched his lips to her brow to quiet her trembling . " You were never alone , ma petite . George was outside the door all the time , guarding it . He 's just now gone to get some sleep , but do you think me the cad to leave you , not assured of your safety ? " " I did n't know what to believe , " she whispered . " I feared you would never come back . " " My God ! You are not very complimentary to me  --  nor to yourself . I would not leave a lady to her own defense in such a place and more certainly my own wife and she heavy with my child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll not leave you again while we 're here . " She lifted her eyes to his and saw a kindly warmth in them . " No , there is no need , " she murmured . " I 'll not be frightened again . " He cupped her chin in his hand . " Then let us go to bed . The day has been long and I am tired . " Wiping the tears from her cheeks , she climbed into bed on the side nearest the door and watched him quietly as he opened the bundle George had carried in with her own . Her eyes widened as he took out the box of Flintlock pistols with which she had once threatened the servant . He brought it with him to the bed where she lay , and dropping down beside her , took out the pistols and began to load them . " Do you expect trouble ? " she questioned softly , sitting up . He glanced at her and smiled . " It 's just a precaution I sometimes take when I 'm not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my love . " She watched curiously as he loaded one , remembering her own distress when she had tried to determine how and had not been able to . Seeing her interest , Brandon laughed softly . " Do you wish now to learn how to load these ? " he asked , smiling . " You do very well as it is with them empty . George was quite embarrassed when he found that you had tricked him . The fact that a mere wisp of femininity had made him quake with fright before an empty gun injured his pride . He was impossible for some time after . So was I for that matter , " he added gruffly , remembering the way he had viciously hurled a string of oaths at the servant when he had returned to the Fleetwood and found the girl gone . His disposition had not improved any when he also found that she had disappeared without a trace . 103  | He took her arm and pulled her to the edge of the bed beside him . " But it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how a pistol is loaded , I will teach you . " Then he looked into her eyes and warned , " But do n't ever make the mistake of thinking you can turn these on me and not use them . I am not George and you would have to kill me before you could escape . " He laughed again softly . " And as for that , I doubt that you have it in you to kill a man , so I think I would be safe in taking these from you . " Heather swallowed hard . She stared up at him silently , with eyes round as moons . She believed every word he said . He was not one to make idle threats . They sat very close together on the edge of the bed , so close their bodies touched  --  her thigh against his , her arm pressed to his side . His arm was braced behind her , his hand resting on the bed very near her buttocks . Her composure was sorely strained . Nervously she dropped her gaze and pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees , realizing it had slid up almost to her hips when he pulled her to him . " May I try to load this one , " she asked , hesitantly touching the pistol he held in his other hand . " If you wish , " he replied , handing it to her . The Flintlock was heavy and meant for a man 's hand . She found it ' uncomfortable in hers . Laying it across her knees , she took up the powder horn and lifted the muzzle of the pistol to pour the gun powder down it . " Turn it away from your face , " Brandon directed . She obeyed and poured a small amount of the gray powder into the muzzle . As she had seen him do , she stuffed a piece of paper in and with the rod rammed it down the barrel , then wrapped a lead ball in a patch of oiled cloth and pushed it down the muzzle also . It was done . " You learn very quickly , " Brandon murmured as he took the pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . " Perhaps you will be another Molly Pitcher . " Glancing up at him , she frowned slightly . " Who is she , Brandon ? " ii she asked softly , not realizing that she had spoken his name for the first time . He smiled and reached up to touch one of her glossy curls . " It was a name given to women who helped carry water to American soldiers in battle and to one woman in particular who helped to hold the line against the British at Monmouth . " 104  | " But you are English too , Brandon , are you not ? " she asked , gazing up at him with curious eyes . He laughed , " Indeed no , madam . I 'm an American . My family came from here , it is true , but long before they died they considered themselves loyal Americans . My father helped fight the British and as a boy so did I. You will have to get used to the idea that your beloved England is not so beloved where we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said in much astonishment . " You sail here and do business with the people you once fought . " He shrugged his shoulders . " I am a man of business . I sell my cotton and goods to the English for a profit . They sell me what my people will buy for more profit . I never hold grudges if I think it will interfere with the business of making money . Besides , I do a service for my country in bringing back the things that are needed and are not yet obtainable . " " Do you come here every year then ? " " I have been for the last ten years , but this will be my last year . I have a plantation to run . I ca n't neglect it any longer . And now I have other responsibilities on the way . I 'll be selling the Fleetwood when I get home . " Something caught at Heather 's heart . Was it possible he meant never to sail again , to settle down and be a father to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominal position in his household . The very thought flooded her being with warmth and she almost relaxed against him . But cold reality and doubt chilled the dream . " Will I live on your plantation too ? " she asked , almost fearing the answer . " Of course , " he replied , rather amazed at her question . " Where did you think you would live ? " She shrugged her shoulders nervously . " I  --  I did n't know . You did n't say . " He chuckled . " So now you know . Now do be a good girl and get into bed and go to sleep . Your chattering has worn me out . " She crawled into bed again as he stood up and began to undress . When he had stripped , he motioned her across the bed . " It 's best I sleep nearest the door , " he said . She quickly moved to the other side of the bed and did not ask why she must . It was clear he expected something to happen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A dingy lantern hung aglow in the courtyard below and in the gusty evening breeze , cast its bouncing shadows dimly into the room . To her dismay , 105  | Heather found that her hair was streaming across Brandon 's pillow and was caught beneath him . She waited for him to free her , but a long time passed and he did not and then she knew he would not for he had fallen asleep with his cheek against her soft curls . With a sigh of resignation , she settled herself to pass the night in bondage , but with his presence close beside her , she found security and she sank into the nether realms of slumber . From the depths of sleep she struggled with terror 's spurs goading her to full awareness . A hand pressed tightly over her mouth , smothering screams bred of panic . Her eyes flew open and in frenzied reaction she clawed at the hand . Then her husband 's face loomed up close above hers in the darkness , and with senses returning , her fear passed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him in confusion , her eyes wide and searching . " Lie still , " he whispered softly . " Do n't move . Do n't make a sound . Pretend to be asleep . " She nodded her head to let him know she would obey . His hand slid away and he sank down again beside her . His breath came slow and even , as if he were asleep , and from beyond the door she could hear a muffled voice and an odd picking and scratching at the door itself . The bar slowly began to lift , and she struggled to control her own breathWith the fluttering in her chest it was no easy task . A dim thread of light appeared and grew wider as the door swung open . Through slitted eyes she watched and saw a head appear . She heard a whisper . " They 're asleep . Come on . " Two dark figures stole into the room , and the door was pushed shut . Heather gritted her teeth as the men moved forward and almost jumped when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do not wake the bloke , you fool , or we may not get the girl . He 's not a wee one . " " She 's across the bed , " the other whispered a little louder . " Sh-sh , " the first hissed , " Do n't you ken , I kin see that with me own two eyes . " They approached almost to the foot of the bed when Brandon snaked the pistols from beneath the sheets and sat up . " Hold your pace , lads , " he demanded . " You 've been found out . And do stand very still for these worthy pieces have two leaden balls to hole your hides . "  | The two froze in mid stride , one half turned as if to flee with the other holding his companion 's arm . " Heather , light the candle that we might set faces to our midnight visitors , " Brandon urged . She crawled behind him quickly and lit the candle on the commode . The glow of its flame spread over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proving them to be the same two who had huddled across the room from them at mealtime . " We meant no real ' arm , " one spluttered . " We would n't ' urt the girl . " The other intended kidnaper was bolder . " We can guarantee you a tidy sum for ' er , cap'n . She 'll bring more'n ' er weight in gold from a certain duke we know . It wo n't matter that she 's no virgin even . " His eyes went to Heather and he grinned , showing badly rotted teeth . " She 's well worth the price , cap'n . We 'll split three ways , we will . " Trembling , Heather pressed closer to her husband and drew the bedcovers up under her chin . She disliked the way the men leered at her . She knew if they had been successful in taking her she would have been used many times by both of them before she 'd have ever been presented to the duke . They were akin to William Court , intent upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stood up and faced the men . He was casually unconcerned with his state of undress and bore the pistols with a careless swagger which did not ease the two thieves ' nervousness . Heather felt the heat rising to her face . It was one thing to be alone with Brandon when he was naked , but to have others present  --  it was something else entirely . His male nudity seemed all the more startlingly bare to her with these men here . " I must disappoint you good gentlemen , " he said lightly . " This girl carries my child , and I am a selfish man . " " It wo n't matter about ' er , cap'n , " the timid one interrupted . " The dukie will bed ' er in the ninth month , and seeing she 's so comely , it wo n't be difficult for him . ' e 'll give her a few hours to whelp , then ' e 'll be on her again . ' e 'll pay the same for ' er now , an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find another wench to warm your bed . " Brandon 's eyes burned coldly and his knuckles grew white about the pistols . A small tic began to show itself in his cheek . " There 's a foul odor in this room that almost smothers me , " he drawled , a forced grin twisting his lips . " Step over to the window ,  | laddies , and open it for me . And do be gentle as you go , for my hands grow weary . The two men scrambled to obey , then turned again to the Yankee smiling . " And now , my hearties , I must once more explain before you take your departures , " Brandon began in a slow , precise way , almost gently . Then his voice became very menacing and dreadful with his rage apparent in each separate word . " This girl is my wife and carries my child . She belongs to me , and what is mine , I keep ! " The last words seemed to blast all thoughts of gain from the brigands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and small beads of sweat dappled their brows . They now became deeply concerned with their continued longevity . " But , cap'n , she  --  we ? " They both stuttered in their attempts to placate him . The bolder one finally managed to speak clearly . " But , cap'n , we did n't know . No common wife would seem so fine to bed . I mean , sir ? " " Be gone with you , " Brandon roared . " Take your leave before I throttle you both ! " They started toward the door , but were halted as Brandon chuckled wickedly . " Oh no , laddies . The window will do sufficiently well . " They gawked and spluttered at him . " But , Cap'n , would ye ' ave us break our necks on the cobblestones ? " " Out ! " The pistols threatened and the two men scrambled to comply . They scuffled briefly and the bolder one plunged through the window , whether aided or not was uncertain . A meaty thud , then strangled curses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've broken both my poor legs , you sea scurvy bastard ! " was the man 's cry . The meeker one gazed backwards , but Brandon gestured and the man made his reluctant departure . Upon his arrival below , a cacophony of angry shrieks , oaths and moans became an original account of the many possibilities of what might have occurred on Brandon 's family tree . But their shrieks only drew an amused chuckle from the second-story window as Brandon closed it . He barred the door again and secured the bar so it could not be lifted again from without . The sounds outside dwindled off as the two thieves hobbled away .
