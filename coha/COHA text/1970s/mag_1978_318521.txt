Baryshnikov gets off to a fast start with a new company <P> At the windows of a rehearsal room at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center , rows of little female heads glisten in the sun , their chins just making it up to the sill . They are lucky children , for they are watching New York City Ballet Choreographer George Balanchine rehearse his newest principal dancer , Mikhail Baryshnikov . The session is long and hard , and it is going very well . Baryshnikov leaps into the whimsical salutes of Stars and Stripes . He and the choreographer pause to discuss some points , speaking in Russian-a common language for both . Later , Baryshnikov , 30 , whips through a fast , intricate sequence from Rubies . He repeats it several times with the same unrelenting charge of energy . Balanchine , 74 , watches with a private inward smile . American ballet 's hottest , most speculated-on alliance is off to a flying start . <P> Misha Baryshnikov left the American Ballet Theater last May in order to dance the works of Balanchine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would dance in with his new company in New York during June . It was probably a good idea to begin in the summer season at Saratoga Springs , for if there is any respite from the demands of superstardom , it can be found in this quiet , informal arts center . The performing area is a pavilion that seats 5,100 ( many more people can see the action from some distance on the lawn ) . Saratogans take pride in their July visitors . Ask any shopkeeper , and he will tell you that the dancers and their fans are nicer than the horse-racing crowd that overwhelms the town in August . <P> Baryshnikov 's debut , as Frantz in Coppelia , was at a matinee . The crowd was full of mothers and kids who had bought seats long before the announcement of Baryshnikov 's appearance . Frantz is an ebullient young man ; his entrance is a headlong dash to the front of the stage . Baryshnikov made it his signature : an outpouring of physical power and grace , as well as a challenge to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of rough spots : in the first act he strolled onstage ahead of cue and was stuck watching dances he had nothing to do with . But in the last and showiest act , he silenced any doubts that he would somehow scale down his jumps to what is referred to as the " Balanchine style . " He leaped like a cat and , as always , seemed to hang in the air . <P> He next appeared in a very different work , Jerome Robbins ' Afternoon of a Faun , which has almost no steps at all . It is a brief , seductive work about two dancers practicing in front of a " mirror " ( actually the proscenium ) and gradually making enigmatic erotic contact with each other . Baryshnikov 's first original Balanchine works are Stars and Stripes and Rubies , both of which happen to call for speed , wit and fiendish virtuosity . <P> Misha 's impact at the box office was immediate . Says Herbert Chesbrough , manager of the arts center : " There is a demand for tickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited . One admits there is " healthy envy " among men who may have to wait longer to get certain roles . But , says another , " we have n't seen some of the moves he has . After he leaves the rehearsal room , the boys try them out . "
