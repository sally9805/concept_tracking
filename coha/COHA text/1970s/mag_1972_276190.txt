Arriving in the midst of the ITT affair , an article in LIFE last week raised still more questions about the relationship between the Nixon Administration and some of its wealthy political backers . The central figure in the story was San Diego Millionaire C. Arnholt Smith , a longtime Nixon backer . Smith was under investigation in 1970 for possible violations of federal law by channeling campaign contributions to Nixon in 1968 . LIFE charged that through the White House , the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service , the Administration tried to squelch investigations , delay prosecutions and interfere with cases involving Smith , another major G.O.P. fund raiser in San Diego and a former mayor of the city , Democrat Frank Curran . <P> Smith refused to comment on LIFE 'S charges for the present . The Justice Department issued a curt denial . But two former federal investigators who were involved in the cases supported LIFE 'S story . One of the strongest denunciations came from Vice President Spiro Agnew . In Los Angeles for a press conference of high school journalists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect for a magazine that has such a high gullibility quotient that they would publish the Clifford Irving story . " LIFE , of course , never did publish the Irving story . Agnew added , " The best and most charitable thing LIFE could do would be to follow the course taken by Look magazine " - which folded last year . But when he was asked repeatedly whether the LIFE article was accurate , Agnew snapped , " That is a damn stupid question . I have n't even read it yet . "
