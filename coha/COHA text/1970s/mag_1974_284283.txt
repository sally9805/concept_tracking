For a quarter-century , Italians have taken it for granted that whatever else happens , the ruling Christian Democrats would remain in control and the Communists would never share power . Both assumptions were valid enough in better times , but they are clearly suspect in a year in which the economy sinks further toward possible disaster every day . Last week , after a month without any government at all-and with no viable coalition in sight-even the most cynical of Italians were wondering just how many political crises it would take for the Christian Democrats to ask the Communists ' help to save the country . <P> On any day , at almost any place along the boot of Italy , there is evidence of breakdown . In Rome , hundreds of police fought pitched battles with 600 left-wing students in a square in the picturesque Trastevere section , Rome 's equivalent of the Left Bank . Outside Milan , arsonists , probably belonging to a leftist group called the Red Brigades , burned down the warehouses of a company associated with ITT , destroying $10 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unemployed men , along with their families , blocked a main north-south railway line . Fifty people were arrested before the line was reopened . In Venice , trash collectors blockaded the Grand Canal for two hours with scores of garbage scows . <P> Short Time . Angered by the highest inflation rate of any country in the Common Market-nearly 25% in the past year-workers have staged almost daily strikes for higher wages . Since none of the unions have funds for a prolonged strike , the stoppages usually last for no more than half a day . " The workers may strike for four hours in the morning and then work four hours in the afternoon , " says Socialist Labor Leader Piero Boni . " We have found that form of strike the most effective for disrupting production , and we always try to organize things so that the workers get their meals . " This week the huge ( 7.6 million members ) National Trade Union Confederation will carry things a step further by calling a general strike that could stop the whole country for half a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government figures last week put the unemployed total at 800,000 , or 6% of the total work force . Another 500,000 are on short time , earning less than a full salary . Some union leaders are now being accused by the rank and file of softness toward management . During a recent strike in Turin , Carlo Donat-Cattin , the staunchest labor supporter in the ruling Christian Democratic Party , was practically yanked off the platform when he spoke at a rally . " The workers were already fed up with high prices , " says Salvatore Guzzardi , a Turin metal workers ' steward . " Now they 're frightened of losing their jobs too . "
