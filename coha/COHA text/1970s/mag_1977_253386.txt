Never mind whether Scarlett and Rhett ever got together again . What the world wants to know is whether Annie Hall and Alvy Singer will manage to get their inadequacies synchronized and live together anxiously ever after . The answer , neurosis fans , is yes ! Woody Allen and Diane Keaton , who gave the ' 70s a love story to believe in , green and warty and sour as a good dill pickle , live together on Manhattan 's East Side , in apartments ten blocks apart . <P> Visit her flat , a half-furnished encampment that looks as if someone got a great bargain in white paint , and Allen is on the phone . Interview Allen in his penthouse , a comfortable layout that might belong to a literate lawyer , and Keaton has just called . Anxieties have gnawed dangerously at confidence during the night , and repairs must be made . " I 'm a guilt-ridden , anhedonic type , " says Allen , whose conversation can sound like a Woody Allen movie without the jokes . He lives with despair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None of them achieved what I 'd hoped to do . " Keaton argues that the films are lovely , funny , an imperishable national asset . <P> Her turn . Says Allen , " She is always afraid that she is never going to work again . She worries that she has n't earned her success . " Keaton is going to cut her first record in a few months , and , Allen predicts , " she will have no problem whatsoever performing . But she worries that she is not an interesting singer . Now she is worried about her role in my new film and worried that when she is older she will be one of those actresses who have n't aged well . " He tells her she is great . <P> " Diane was just born funny , " Allen says . " She can take a perfectly straight paragraph and read it and you 'll be rolling on the floor . She has unfailing good taste . Her mind is never clouded by popular opinion , the need to score points . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world love it , and she can pick it up and say ' I do n't know what 's so great about this . ' And she 'll be right . "
