txt served notice on the Daley administration Wednesday that he alone will . recommend federal appointments to Presidentelect Carter . However , Stevenson said in a phone interview he would " listen " to Daley 's suggestions . " I will listen to the chairman of the Cook County Democratic Central Committee Daley , and to Sen. Percy , and to anyone else who cares to offer advice , " Stevenson ' said . " And I 'm not , going to give anyone a veto over my recommendations to Carter or to the Senate . I will listen to advice . " Stevenson 's comments appeared to substantiate reports that Daley 's failure to carry Illinois for Carter  --  and , more importantly , his failure to win the governorship and Cook County state 's attorneys office  --  are resulting in an erosion of power and political prestige for Daley . AS THE ONLY Democratic senator from Illinois , Stevenson inherits ? the political mantle of dispensing federal patronage jobs , including judges and United States Attorneys . Notes of his interview with a reporter were taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All I can say is that I will have one standard ? and that is the highest , " Stevenson said . During the eight years of Republican ascendancy , Percy and Stevenson worked closely to nominate well-respected . lawyers as federal judges . Stevenson was asked during the interview whether he would recommend a replacament for U.S. Atty . Samuel K. Skinner ? a Republican appointee ? or whether he would permit Skinner to stay . " If Sam Skinner is the best qualified in a community of 7 million and I have anything to say about it , he will continue , ' he said . And I expect to have a great deal to say about it . " SKINNER , FIRST U. S. attorney in this district to rise through the ranks , said , " I 've requested , that I be retained because I believe I am the most qualified person for this job . " I am encouraged by hearing Sen. Stevenson say that he will continue the tradition begun by him and Sen. Percy of picking the most qualified men for positions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
