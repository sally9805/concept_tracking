AFTER a quarter-century , the U.N . survives , but the question remains of how much it accomplishes beyond that . Secretary-General U Thant 's own assessment is that " the U.N . has done well , but it has not done well enough . " Certainly it is no longer a defense of the U.N . ' s record merely to recall Adlai Stevenson 's remark that if the U.N . were to disappear , something very much like it would have to be created . One of its most useful functions remains as a place for hostile big powers to meet and , if they so desire , to use U.N . machinery to carry out the results of their compromises or deals . The U.N . can no doubt be credited with numerous successes , but its failures have been discouragingly frequent . In the process , it has all too often raised hopes falsely and generated cynicism with its impotence . <P> Some of the U.N . ' s more important hits and misses : <P> KEEPING THE PEACE : Kashmir , Cyprus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Middle East , a U.S.-backed General Assembly resolution successfully cooled the Suez crisis of 1956 , but that plus was wiped out in 1967 . When Cairo demanded that the U.N . pull out its 3,400-man Emergency Force , U Thant swiftly complied rather than try to stall for time . It was one of the more spectacular misjudgments of Thant 's flaccid , nine-year stewardship . As a result , Egypt began mobilizing near Israel 's borders , and the Six-Day War was on . In the Soviet invasions of Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 , the Nigerian civil war and the war in Indochina , U.N . impact has been nil . <P> DECOLONIZATION : Again some hits , but a few strikeouts . <P> <P> The U.N . ' s existence has smoothed the transition of new nations from colonial status to independence . But U.N . condemnations have had no effect on white-minority regimes in Rhodesia and South Africa ; Pretoria has ignored resolutions canceling its mandate in South West Africa . <P> DISARMAMENT : Though the U.N . ' s Geneva Disarmament Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and outer space , the major milestones of arms control-the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963 and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968-were initially worked out by the U.S. and the Soviets . The prospects for future arms control depend on initiatives by Washington and Moscow , not the U.N . <P> ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE : A hit . Attempts to cajole the developed nations into committing 1% of their G.N.P.s to economic aid have not been entirely successful ( only France , surprisingly , meets the goal ; the U.S. figure is closer to one-half of 1% ) . But donor nations , among them the U.S. , are more and more willing to channel aid funds through multinational organizations like the World Bank . <P> FOOD : A qualified hit . New seeds and techniques promoted by the U.N . ' s Food and Agriculture Organization have helped increase world food production by 50% since the end of World War II . But close to 50% of the world 's 3.5 billion people are still under-or malnourished . <P> HEALTH : More hits . The World Health Organization 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of malaria and other diseases .
