WE will not be a part of the window dressing for this system of unfair and inequitable Government control of wages for the benefit of business profits . " On that tendentious note , George Meany , autocratic boss of the AFL-CIO , followed through on a recurring threat last week and stomped off the Pay Board . Three other labor leaders walked out with him . Their immediate reason for resigning : the board 's decision to override them and cut back the West Coast dock-strike settlement from a 20.6% first-year raise to 14.9% , which itself is more than twice the basic wage guidepost . The surprise departure of Meany and Presidents I.W. Abel of the Steelworkers , Floyd Smith of the Machinists , and Leonard Woodcock of the Auto Workers threatened briefly to overturn the Administration 's painfully constructed controls on wages and prices . <P> President Nixon reacted swiftly to save his program . After hurried meetings with top aides , including Treasury Secretary John Connally and Budget Boss George Shultz , Nixon declared : " I shall not be deterred by the disaffection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America 's 80 million wage earners . " His solution was to continue controls under a rejiggered Pay Board . Instead of a tripartite panel made up of five members each from business , labor and the public , the board will now have five public members and one representative from labor and business . Ironically , Frank E. Fitzsimmons , president of the scandal-scarred Teamsters , who refused to walk out , is for the moment the panel 's lone labor spokesman . " Fitz " owes a favor to the President , who commuted former Teamster Boss Jimmy Hoffa 's prison term last year . <P> Politics First . Meany 's opposition was inspired more by politics than economics . In the upper ranks of the AFL-CIO , the distrust and dislike of Richard Nixon is so intense that , as one Teamster officer says , it verges on " paranoia . " Many months ago , Meany demanded wage-price controls while the President was still voicing an almost theological opposition to them . When the President turned around and embraced controls , Meany held out for a tripartite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not attended a board meeting since November , but he has sent his economist Nat Goldfinger , who for quite a while did all he could to block proceedings and sow dissension . <P> Even so , labor fared fairly well at the hands of the Pay Board . Four important pay cases came before it , and the board gave unions all they wanted in two of them ; railroad workers got a 10% raise and soft-coal miners a 15% increase . But the West Coast dock workers were cut down , and the first-year settlement in the ailing aerospace industry was clipped from 12% to 8% . The unionists had their own way in many policy matters , such as lifting the limit on catch-up settlements to 7% . <P> Despite labor 's spoiler tactics , the panel made progress , the economy picked up , Nixon 's chances for re-election seemed to brighten . Thus Meany 's position as a " team member " on the board became untenable . He has made no secret of his earnest desire to block Nixon 's reelection . The rejection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in high dudgeon , and Meany took it . <P> His exit is not likely to affect Pay
