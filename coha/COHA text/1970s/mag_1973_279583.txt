There was no joy in Castelfranco Veneto . The northern Italian town 's major industry , the Confitex raincoat and cloth factory , which employed 1,650 workers , was about to close . The company was nearly $20 million in debt and losses were mounting daily . Lamented the parliamentary representative from that district : " For us , Confitex 's closing will be worse than an earthquake . " <P> That was little more than a year ago . <P> Today Confitex and Castelfranco Veneto are thriving , beneficiaries of a new government-sponsored hospital for ailing companies . The agency , known as GEPI ( for Gestioni e Partecipazioni Industriali , or Industrial Management and Participation ) , was created by the Italian government 18 months ago to revive fundamentally strong firms that have fallen on hard times . And times have been particularly hard for Italy 's industry in the past three or four years . Under the impact of incessant strikes , inept management , stiffening foreign competition and generally dismal economic conditions , Italian companies have been disappearing as fast as scampi at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . <P> Since its inception , GEPI has received more than 200 applications for help , of which 50 have been accepted and another 50 are still under consideration . Some 80 companies were turned down as hopeless cases , and another 20 had to go elsewhere for treatment ; one of GEPI 'S ground rules is that a patient can not be accepted unless there is a demonstrably good chance of recovery . GEPI 'S usual therapy is to use government money to buy a minority , or in some cases a majority holding in an ailing company . Whenever possible the agency tries to find private firms to buy shares as well . Often GEPI arranges a merger with a stronger company . If a company 's situation appears hopeless , GEPI may simply abandon it and concentrate on developing a substitute industry in the region to provide alternative employment . In the case of Castelfranco Veneto 's Confitex , GEPI bought a 100% interest in the firm and streamlined its production . <P> In many instances GEPI analysts use the newly bought shares to oust a firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men trained in U.S. management techniques . <P> " We try to rob American firms , " jokingly admits GEPI General Manager Franco Grassini , himself a product of Harvard and the London School of Economics . The agency 's president , Enrico Bignani , served on an advisory committee ft trie Harvard Business School for seven years , and no fewer than 15 of its top staff members either graduated from U.S. business schools or learned the art of management at such American-based multinationals as General Electric , Westinghouse and W.R.
