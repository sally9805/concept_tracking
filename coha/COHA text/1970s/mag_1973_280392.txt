" I am caught up on the great bulk of it , but I ask myself : Will one man ever be caught up on all the details ? " The speaker is Harvard Law Professor Archibald Cox , the Watergate special prosecutor summoned by the Nixon Administration to clean its own house . For nearly two months now , in a heavily guarded office at 1425 K Street , he has been sifting the paper mountains of testimony and reports . As Cox , 61 , looks ahead , he recalls that the Teapot Dome investigation took six years , and adds , " I rather expect to spend the rest of my working life in this role . " <P> Cox now has 18 lawyers and 17 other staff members to help him . For the present , he has divided his investigation into five segments , he told TIME Correspondent Hays Gorey in his first interview since taking office . He expects the total to expand and the categories to shift , but the current breakdown is : 1 ) Watergate itself , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " dirty tricks " that revolved around Political Saboteur Donald Segretti , 3 ) contributions to the Committee for the Re-Election of the President , including possible extortionary and other illegal methods of fund raising , 4 ) operations of " the plumbers , " from the raid on the office of Daniel Ellsberg 's psychiatrist to the tapping of newsmen 's phones , and 5 ) the question of the International Telephone &; Telegraph Corp . campaign donations just when the Administration was settling its antitrust suit against the conglomerate . Reports that Cox is also looking into the financing of the Western White House at San Clemente have been denied , but he has not ruled out the subject for future inquiry . In fact , the special prosecutor has clearly taken on the task of investigating just about anything he chooses . <P> No Dismay . With the resignation two weeks ago of the three original Watergate prosecutors-Assistant U.S. Attorneys Earl J. Silbert , Seymour Glanzer and Donald E. Campbell-Cox is now totally on his own . He made that stingingly clear when word leaked out last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haldeman , John Ehrlichman , John Mitchell and John Dean . The leak was a " gross breach of professional ethics , " said Cox , adding that if he found a member of his staff responsible , that individual would be " immediately dismissed . " <P> The lawyers on Cox 's staff now are almost all graduates of the Kennedy Administration . That stands to reason , since Cox , a Democrat , was John Kennedy 's and Lyndon Johnson 's Solicitor General from 1961 to 1965 ( before that he had served in both the Justice and Labor Departments under Franklin Roosevelt ) . But White House officials have voiced no loud dismay about the Kennedy hue of Cox 's staff . " We needed a symbol of independence , " says one . " We can hardly complain when he does n't hire Nixon Republicans . "
