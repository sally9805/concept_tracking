Mirror , studies the estrangement of both artist and audience from the artwork , discovering anew the sorrow that the estrangement increases even as the aesthetic experience becomes more intense : " As words go crying after themselves , leaving the dream/Upended in a puddle somewhere/As though " dead " were just another adjective . " At one moment in Litany , Ashbery com ? mends Keats 's sonnet , " On the Peter Clarke has taken as his subject the earnest but invigorating men and women who , at the end of the last century and the beginning of this , conducted the great debate in England between liberalism and socialism , in ? dividualism and collectivism , reform and revolution , always with the object of directly influencing the policies of the reigning governments and parties , and in particular of improving the condition of the poor . Although Mr. Clarke concentrates his attention on only four of them ? L , T. Hobhouse , J. L. Ham ? mond , Graham Wallas , J. A. Hobson ? these four did not debate only with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson , Bernard Shaw , Gilbert Murray , Bertrand Russell , the Webbs , R. H. Tawney , J. M. Keynes , Harold Laski , Arnold Toynbee . . . and this is still only a skimming . They were all unusually gifted and articulate men and women who wrote to each other and kept diaries at least as copiously as they published and lec ? tured , so there are rich veins of their own sharp observations for Mr. Clarke to work , which he does with a firm but unobtrusive hold on the material . Some of the key figures in the debate were as much household names in liberal and progressive circles in America as in their own country : Tawney ( The Acquisitive Society ) , Hobson ( Imperialism ) , Wallas ( Human Nature in Politics ) , and of course the Fabians . One has only to read the back issues of this magazine to trace their influence , and several of them were either occasional Grasshopper and Cricket , " as writing that does not offend us . At his best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote from all offense. or regular contributors to it . When the brilliant young American critic , Ran ? dolph Bourne , went to England in 1913 ? 14 , he sought them out , and his judgments were as sparkling as any in Mr. Clarke 's book . " Professor Hob-house , excessively judicial , with the high consciousness of excellence which the Liberal professor seems to exude " ; " Graham Wallas , with his personal vivacity and lack of any clear philos ? ophy , who considered the American sociologist a national disaster " ; and " John A. Hobson , whom ' can not admire too much , a publicist with immense stores of knowledge , poise of mind , and yet radical philosophy and gifts of journalistic expression . " The impor ? tance of these men and women has never been in doubt . Journalism was their common form of expression . Some of them took academic posts and administrative positions , partly to bolster their incomes , but otherwise they spent much of their long careers , in some cases to the end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They took the idea of getting a living as something by the way , " writes Mr. Clarke . It was typical that Hammond refused both a knighthood and a Companionship of Honour , when these were offered , With no foundations or universities to lavish funds on them , no Italian villa where they could be pampered while they wrote their books , they nevertheless produced works that are still classics in their fields , even while turning out daily and weekly journalism of the very highest order . Mr. Clarke never loses sight of them as individuals , but his main interest is rightly in their ideas . At the beginning he makes a distinction between the " moral- and the " " mechanical " revolutionist : the first believing that only a moral change in our natures , " a change of heart , a new consciousness , will be the agent and sanction of a transformation within society " ; the second believing that no such spon ? taneous change can be expected , since people are creatures of their cir ? cumstances , " and change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above by the vanguard party . " He argues that there is " an equally impor ? tant division between the moral and the mechanical reformist , " and it can be tracked down again in the difference between the moral regenerationist or reformist and the pessimistic quietist . Every one of these ? the last is the best of our neoconservatives ? is among us today . This review is not the place to trace where and how they disagreed ? this is the accomplishment of Mr. Clarke , doing what one hardly believes could be done , bringing a dead debate back to life ? but they have much to say to the uneasy and vagrant liberals and progressives of today . " Until the Liberal Party is based again on ' the intolerable disease ' of lifelong thought , it must continue to decay , " said Wallas in 1Q26 , and the same words could be addressed to the Democratic party and its lost liberals today . All of Mr. Clarke 's subjects were interested in the practical programs of politics , and would toil to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time that was all that they could hope to get . But they also knew that even the most practical programs of reform need a philosophical underpin ? ning . The conservative can always take his stand on a pessimistic view of human nature , but the reformer constantly has to be reexamining and restating his optimism , the ultimate justifications of what T. H. Green called his " passion for improving mankind . " So amongst their committee work and their journalism they philosophized . They sustained their disease of lifelong thought from the 1880s all the way into the 1040s , These years saw the emer ? gence of the working class as a political force ; the permeation of all progressive thought by Marxism ; the simultaneous rise of trade unions and socialist movements ; the revolution in Russia ; the counterrevolutions of fascism and national socialism ; two world wars of ueou s aestruction ; the growth of bureaucracy ; the impact of Darwinism ; the inrush of psychiatry ; the collapse of religion ; and what not else that all but destroyed the world into which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quailed and how seldom ; they clung to their belief in reason and persuasion and , against the fearful odds of the times , in the power of these to better men 's lives . Only a very few of them , and then rarely for long , threw in their hats with the Bolsheviks . They lifted their eyes now and then to see if there might not really be a new heaven or at least a new hope ; but one by one they came down , hard and fast , against the tyranny of communism in Russia . They might explore , like Wallas in 1- limarr Nature m Politics , the then unappreciated power of irrationality in human nature , and therefore in the processes of democracy ; they might be impatient at the readiness of the working class to vote for the status quo ; they might momentarily be tempted to excesses of their own underlying elitism , as they trod the tightrope between the " moral " and the " mechanical " remedies ; but they did not lose faith in " the amenability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them who became socialists were clear and insistent that " it had to be socialism with a human face . " Their " gifts of journalistic expression " were a part of their method and their saving : a very English way of forcing the abstract into the presence and to the test of the concrete . If one conies to this book from a reading of Gordon A. Craig 's superb Germcmy , 1866-1945 , which covers exactly the same period , how can one not be grateful for the empiricism and waywardness of the Anglo-Saxon temper ? ( Even as it saunters about and objects to blood sports , as these men and women did , with the same passion as they objected to militarism ! ) It is good to be reminded that ideas that were erected by continental thinkers into systems were independently explored by English thinkers who were confident enough to leave them untidy . Lenin 's scornful comments in the margins of his copy of Hobson 's Imperiaii : , m exactly make the point . For all their deep indignation at the sheer grinding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and women in this book were also moved , with an equal distress and clarity , to a recognition that what they were talking about was a spiritual and cultural impoverishment as well . When the few survivors of their band found the world after 1045 so cold and alien to them , and their elitism surfaced with all the petulance of defeated and disappointed and helpless old age , their real objection was to the " popular culture " with which the working class was being saddled : that working class which they had so selflessly sought to enrich , not only with decent wages and adequate pensions , but with all the boons to the mind and the spirit which by privilege they had enjoyed . In his remarkable histories of the Industrial Revolution , Hammond looked more and more at this cultural as well as material impoverishment ; and in describing how popular opinion might be manipulated , Wallas was also adum ? brating how popular culture might be Edward Hoagland has been called a " writer 's writer , " a label that suggests extravagant praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his earlier admirers , we learn in his 1968 essay , " On Not Being A Jew , " was Saul Bellow . A magazine editor , when informed of this , was astonished : " You ? He does ? " Bellow 's enthusiasm was for Hoagland 's fiction , a genre he has n't published since 1969 . Since then he has devoted himself to mastering the personal essay , and readers have had to subscribe to a variety of magazines ( Village Voice , Harper 's , Atlantic , Commen tary , and others ) or buy one of his little-known collections of essays ( great titles : The Courage of Turtles , Walking the Dead Diamond River , Red Wolves and Black Bears ) to get their fill of his gorgeous prose . Random House has now released an Edward Hoagland reader simultaneous ? ly with his new travel book on the Sudan , giving reviewers a special incen ? tive to bring his singular talent to the attention of a larger audience . Hoagland 's " oddball " prose , Geoffrey Wolff says in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , to be sure , in Hoagland 's essays ( on tugboats orused to manipulate . So they stood then on the frontiers , ready to contend , where the battle is still joined . When did you last read a deeply thoughtful book that lifted your spirit with strenuous unillusioned hope ? Mr. Clarke has written one . With an affec ? tion born of knowledge and the skill of literate scholarship , he makes these knotty men and women speak for themselves , his own voice an ever present but not persistent " by the way " ; so giving us a work that is enchanting , vigorous , complex , read ? able , and important beyond the praise of any review . prizefighting or taxidermy or country fairs or whatever ) there 's no mistaking the maker of these words . His wisdom and angst set the tone for each essay , but never so much that he becomes more important than his subject . There is poignancy and conviction , and usually there are heroes in Edward Hoagland 's stories . Like Sugar Hart in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once a contender , who " got into some fast company , got smashed and smashed again , till the fanciness , the eagerness , the confidence and the vanity were crushed . " Like Henri LeMothe , a " low-water man " in the story of same name , a septuagenarian who once dove from a 40-foot ladder and belly-flopped into a play pool of water 12 inches deep : " He goes splat . And when a microphone is put to him ? ' How do you do it ? " ? Henri says , ' Guts ! ' grinning at the pun . " In " The Problem of the Golden Rule , " Hoagland cuts his own swath of belief : " I do n't believe in a god you can pray to , but I do find I believe in God ? I do more than I do n't . I believe in glee and in the exuberance I feel with friends and animals in the fields , and in other emotions besides that . " We learn other things about Edward Hoagland in this collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended " a kind of Yeshiva called Deerfield Academy " ; that he has a severe stutter ( " It may strike other people as more than a spasm , but to me it 's a spasm of pain of a kind which I have n't time for , or time to regard as anything else " ) ; that for him writing is " a Spartan , bloody profes ? sion " ; that his sense of sureness in life is " grounded in the wildness of the natural world . " " Grounded in the wildness of the natural world " ? the line resonates , as does this one from African Calliope ? " the wish to go and live in the bosom of raw nature . " This wish , more than anything , I suspect , is what drew Hoagland to the Sudan But something subtler , too , for as he explains , explorers have always been drawn to the remote regions of the world . For them , as for him , it is the urge to go back to raw nature itself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reexperience his own birth and thereby possibly straighten himself out . " It is an explanation of adventurous travel far more purposeful than the tired " because it 's there . " African Calliope is a different kind of travel book since it adheres to no strict chronological narrative . At first this method seems disjointed ; haphazardly we learn about the Sudan : its size ( bigger than France , Germany , and Spain combined ) ; its agriculture ( three-fourths of the world 's supply of gum arabic ? which helps make the foam in beer , the smoothness of ice cream , the chewiness of gumdrops ? comes from the Sudan ) ; its poverty ; its relentless history of coups and civil wars . But along the fecund Nile , from the Arab North to the black south , even into Ethiopia where the Eritrean struggle rages on , what most interests Hoagland is the tableau of people 's lives . Hoagland 's portrayal of these people the hospitable Sudanese , the well-intentioned United Nations and World Bank personnel , the expatriates from all over ? is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more memorable characters on Hoagland 's calliope is Cornelius Boghosian , an Armenian who bore a stark likeness to Hemingway . Here is vintage Hoagland at work : Boghosian wore a bristly gray mustache and safari jacket , with a suitably clipped manner that showed he had been an officer with one of Montgomery 's divisions . Yet behind these familiar emblems , this protective coloration , was
