txt RENEWER , IF you dare , those warm summer nights at the root-beer stand , Your engine idling ? blum , blum , blum ? and girls giggling as you rumbled past . Remember hot-dogs and hamburgers ? and semi-concealed cigarets , dropped out the window when the coach 's car entered the lot . And remember the root beer . Hardly anyone who is now between 30 and 45 got through those summer nights without root beer . It was served the same way everywhere . Pretty girls brought it in frosted mugs , the mugs wobbling on trays that seemed designed to slide off your car window with a reverberating clatter after a few minutes . With the youthful heartaches and confusion now conveniently forgotten , those days have become the good old days . And those roqt-beer stands are about as // Drive-in restaurants facing hard times // bygone as Burma Shave signs . " THE WORLD , " as one executive In the business summarized , " has changed . " That change has spelled disaster for thousands of wide-eyed business ventures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over . Dog N Suds , one of the root-beer kings , is an example . " Dog N Suds hathalmost 600 places 25 years ago , " said Joe Sweeney , the con poration 's advertising manager . ? " Now we have 130 nationwide . " The chain now has 35 outlets in Mb nols ; it once had 70 . The term drive-in , when applied to restaurants , has come to mean a fast-food franchise offering window pickups . WHAT CAUSED the demise of the res. taur an t s that advertised " curb service " ? Opinions vary . " It was the big chains that ran them out , " said Woodrow Kemp , 61 , who has been selling root beer for 23 years and now operates a'restaurant in Belvidere that offers old-style drive-in service , " They started to go after 's got its first foothold . A few survived , but not many . " The corporations , however , are n't quite so quick to concede that competition beat them . " The state of the economy in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The costs of operation kept going up . And people " Were taking a closer look at how they spent their dollars . " The world has changed since the fun days al going to a place and having the carhops bring food that yo ? ate in your car . " IN SOME AREAS the problems Were much more specific . Drive-in restaurants became teen hangouts , and that often meant too many fights , too much noise . Some towns reacted through zoning laws , simply banning businesses that used carhops or large parking lots . Many drive-ins closed . The most recent victim was Steak N Shake , which this month closed its eight Chicago-area outlets . All eight , according to the company , had been forced to operate without a distinctive Steak N Shake feature ? carhops . But the carhops , where employed , have also been cited as a reason drivein restaurants are closing . Youthful labor is n't as cheap as it used to be , and some day the higher payroll costs pushed drive-in restaurants into the graveyard . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because carhops made some money from tips , employers only had to pay ' half that according to dranquist . Today the minimum wage is $2.65 , but employers still only have to pay half of that'bedause of the tips , he said . " And employers are allowed to knock off some for the food the employe eats , " he added . " In the end , you 're comparing 50 cents or so an hour in 1961 to a. little over a dollar an hour now . In real money ( considering inflation , that 's not more expensive . " BUT THAT does n't mean overall costs have n't risen for the drive-in business . Such a restaurant needs a lot of room ; that means high real-estate costs and property taxes . Some of those involved in the business acknowledge other serious problems . Though the restaurants might have been ? locally owned and operated , they often were franchises . And as the competition sharpened , the home office demanded more . " THEY WANT the food to be the same at every restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us like to do thing 's our way . There are problems . " Dog N Suds has had franchise problems . So has A &W.; The problems have become sensitive enough at the latter firm that company executives wo n't discuss them publicly anymore . Still , the larger chains are not giving up . Dog N Suds has simply changed course . " All of our operations still have curb service , " Sweeney said , " but a lot of them now have dining rooms , too . A lot of people just do n't want to drink cold root beer in their car in the middle of winter . " , KEMP HAS WORKED a long time in Belvidere to make the change . Now his restaurant offers full-course meals in a dining room that seats 65 . Most of his business comes from that dining room , But a dining room alone could lose the trade of the faithful or the nostalgic . " That 's why you have to have all three to-make it , " Kemp said , " You have to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's just the Way it is . " And , according to Kemp , you need one thing more . " Hard work , " lie said . " We 're capable of operatiing year round where we used to have to close for six months . People who think they can work a while and then take off should stay out of this business . " ALL OF WHICH takes diner and businessman alike a long way from the wooden shack that peddled root beer and hamburgers , a long way from the institution that gave us speed bumps and foot-long hot dogs , " I 've been building this for years , " Kemp , said . " And now , . I probably could n't sell it . " Who 's going tCspend 150 to 200 thousand to buy himself a 12-hour-a-day job ? "
