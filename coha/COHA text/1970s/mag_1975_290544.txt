" The human race may begin to fear its scientists to such an extent that it will take uncontrolled action toward them . " <P> When Canadian Psychiatrist Brock Chisholm , former head of the World Health Organization , issued that somber warning in 1957 , the public seemed to be of two minds about scientists-awed by their stunning achievements , but increasingly apprehensive about new dangers brought by technological progress , from nerve gases to nuclear weaponry . How do people feel about scientists today ? Two British weeklies , the New Scientist , which reports developments in research and technology for a largely scientific audience , and New Society , which is dedicated to the social sciences , recently collaborated on an unusual readership poll in order to find an answer-and also to determine whether scientists see themselves differently from how nonscientists see them . <P> The results show a wide chasm between what C.P. Snow called the " two cultures . " For example , most scientists pictured themselves as approachable , open and admired people with wide-ranging interests . Yet most nonscientists thought they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests outside their fields . The two sides disagreed most sharply on whether scientists had a strong sense of right and wrong . Generally , scientists affirmed that they " would stop their work if they thought it was harmful . " But nonscientists were skeptical . Said one reader : " When I think of a scientist , I think of intellectual curiosity triumphing over moral responsibility . " <P> Strong Disenchantment . A few nonscientists were openly abusive . One reader defined a scientist as " an uncultured illiterate . " Others expressed their concern about the " dangers " of science , citing such worries as pollution , weapons research and what one writer described indignantly as experiments on " dogs , rabbits and other small animals in cages . " Disenchantment with scientists was strongest among people in their 30s and 40s ; rather surprisingly , given their supposed doubts about the benefits of modern technology , younger people were the least critical . <P> Many nonscientists said that they still think of scientists as intelligent , highly logical and well educated in their fields-despite a tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least about their own intellectual capacities . They also stressed what has long been regarded as their special virtue : a philosophical commitment to objective truth . <P> Asked to give their mental image of the typical researcher , nonscientists tended to see him as a thin , balding , white-coated , middle-aged man in spectacles . But one reader added a telling apology : " Actually , I know a lot of scientists and they are n't a bit like this . " As a matter of fact , the poll showed that a great many people who have strong opinions about " the scientific community " today are not really familiar with it . Of the 20 scientists most frequently mentioned by name in responses to the survey , only seven are living . Among them : Astronomer Fred Hoyle , Chemist Linus Pauling and Physicist John Taylor . The rest included such figures from the myth-laden past as Archimedes , Galileo , Marie Curie , Darwin and Einstein .                  @ @ @
