Even though three years have passed since crude oil began gushing from a ruptured well under the Santa Barbara Channel , no one yet knows the exact costs of the disaster . As so often happens with social problems in the U.S. , the courts have to put a price tag on values that are hard to measure . The latest decision has come from a Santa Barbara court , where Judge Morton L. Barker ruled that the oil companies responsible for the oil spill-Union Oil , Mobil , Texaco and Gulf-should each pay $500 in criminal penalties . <P> " Outrageous ! " snapped District Attorney David Minier , who is appealing the case to a higher court . The criminal case grew out of violations of Section 5650 of the Fish and Game code , which makes pollution of coastal waters a criminal misdemeanor . Under it , the oil companies were each charged with 343 counts , making a total possible fine of $812,000 . Barker , however , accepted a guilty plea from the companies on only one count each . <P> What moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies have already " suffered sufficiently . " They have indeed paid . To date , some $6 million worth of civil suits , principally one brought by hotelkeepers , property owners and fishermen , have been settled . In addition , Union Oil has spent $10.5 million to clean up tarred beaches . <P> More suits are still outstanding . For example , the state of California , with the county and city of Santa Barbara , is asking for $500 million in civil damages . In other words , Judge Barker 's sympathy seems at least premature , since the potentially heaviest costs remain to be litigated . <P> Despite the obvious costs to the companies , lawyers found it hard to see what civil damages have to do with criminal penalties . Indeed , one critic has compared Judge Barker 's decision to letting a drunken driver off with only a nominal fine after he has paid the hospital-or funeral-costs.
