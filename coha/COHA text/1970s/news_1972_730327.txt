txt Back in the late 1960 's , a contingent of foresters from the United States Department of Agriculture was hard at work in South Vietnam trying to develop the timber industry in that country 's lush forests , which produce fine mahogany and other valued hardwoods . They might have been surprised to learn that , simultaneously , other Forest Service experts were trying just as hard to burn some of those forests down . Last week it was disclosed that with the aid of scientists expert in prevent . ing forest fires , the American military in 1965-67 made several attempts to create " firestorms " in South Vietnam to clear out vegetation sheltering Vietcong troops . Firestorms are set off when a fire begins to suck in air , creating powerful winds that build up into destructive cyclones . Thus another item has joined the list of controversial " environmental " tactics that have been devised by American military technology in the long and agonizing battle for Indochina . The other entries : chemical defoliation , artificial rainmaking and plowing of forests . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck the dikes that hold back flood waters in North Vietnam . As it turned out , the experiment , performed under such coy code names as " Sherwood Forest " and " Pink Rose " was a colossal failure . It created thick billows of smoke , but " not a whole heck of a lot of fire , " as one officer put it , and was abandoned in 1967 because the wet forest would not burn even under most favorable conditions . The venture began in 1965 in response to complaints from field commanders that other methods of defoliation were too slow and inefficient to expose the forest floor fully to aerial view . The Defense Department theorized that forest fires would quickly wipe out all vegetation , from the upper canopy to the ground , and called in its research unit , the Advanced Research Projects Agency , to figure out a way . The agency , in turn , contracted with the Forest Service , which sent over men from its fire research laboratories in Montana and California . The targets were areas of the thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were first chemically defoliated , in the hope of creating dry fuel , and then bombarded with World War II magnesium fire bombs . The last of the futile attempts was made in April , 1967 . One of the mysteries is why the attempt was begun . To a man , forest experts inside and outside of government said that while fires are common in many tropical forests , the forests in Vietnam were just too damp to burn . As Thomas Y. Palmer , a leading Forest Service authority on massive fires and firestorms , said , " Anybody foolish enough to try that is kind of weak in the head . " Of course , fire is not new as a weapon of war ; it is not illegal . During World War II , Allied forces firebombed Dresden and Hamburg , causing massive firestorms that killed hundreds of thousands of German civilians . There was no great outcry then . And although there has been concern over it in recent years , many military men still can not see why the burning of a few trees in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should cause a stir . " Of course the goal was laudatory  --  we were trying to deny the enemy a base camp , " said one officer . " Do you want to save trees or lives ? " And , according to the Defense Department , there was no great secret about the fire project . A spokesman said newsmen were taken to see one of the ignitions in 1967 . If so , it made virtually no impact at the time , perhaps submerged in news of the frantic troop buildup in Vietnam . The initial reactions last week were predictable . A West Coast lawyer was considering a suit charging the Department of Agriculture with violating its mandate . The Pentagon spokesman , Jerry W. Friedheim , confirmed the attempts , but denied the intent was to create World War 11-type firestorms . " In no sense was it an attempt to destroy all the forest , " he said . " It was an attempt to clear the foliage , to clear the leaves from the trees , " - 12 ? 17 ? HEFS.IC Flr-EXPT/FI011C- ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
