THE PROFESSOR OF DESIRE by Philip Roth <P> Farrar , Straus &; Giroux ; 263 pages ; $8.95 <P> The hero of Philip Roth 's tenth book is Jewish and unhappy . So what else , as Alexander Portnoy 's mother might say , is new ? Indeed , David Kepesh is the same slick monologuist that Portnoy was , given to frequent exclamations , flurries of rhetorical questions ( " Is she not the single most desirable creature I have ever known ? " ) and carefully italicized emphases . He tosses off one-liners ( calling , for instance , his Aunt Sylvia " the Benvenuto Cellini of strudel " ) as if he has a stable of Borscht Belt writers churning out his material . On the psychiatric couch , Kepesh is a regular lie-down comic : " I can not maintain an erection , Dr. Klinger . I can not maintain a smile , for that matter . " <P> But as much as Kepesh may resemble Portnoy and Peter Tarnopol-the protagonist-victim in Roth 's My Life as a Man-The Professor of Desire is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monologue is a more humane and thoughtful handling of the subject that has fascinated and obsessed Roth in print for the past ten years : the woebegone , self-destructive tug of war between high aspirations and low lusts . Kepesh is another of Roth 's Jewish centaurs , trying to keep his head in a cloud of pipe smoke while ignoring his pawing hooves . <P> The novel is Kepesh 's feverish attempt to explain how he got that way . The only child of doting parents who run a summer resort in the Catskills , he develops early on a taste for the disreputable in the person of Herbie Bratasky , the New York City-imported social director at his parents ' hotel . Herbie can make a whole range of bathroom noises with his mouth and looks as though he may be successful with women . One winter , young Kepesh receives a letter from his hero describing Herbie 's latest toilet imitations and , against all the dictates of prudence , carries it around in his trousers .

" <P> Such a precariously balanced conscience at so tender an age leaves Kepesh nowhere to go but down , then up , then down again . It is a pattern that comes to define his life . At college , uncooperative coeds help him keep naughty Kepesh at bay ; nice Kepesh becomes a perceptive student of Anton Chekhov 's " romantic disillusionment " and wins a Fulbright scholarship . In London , disaster - and on the other hand , bliss . Kepesh takes up lodgings with two Swedish girls , one of whom outstrips his most humid sexual fantasies . <P> Birgitta is " sane , clever , courageous , self-possessed - and wildly lascivious ! Just what I 've always wanted . " Kepesh 's studies suffer as a result of his debauches , and he naturally runs from Birgitta and be comes a sobersided graduate student at Stanford .
