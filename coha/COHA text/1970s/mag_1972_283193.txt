Just before the Jefferson Airplane went on stage in Akron , another rock group urged the 12,000 people in the audience to dance on the neighboring football field of Akron University , despite the fact that it had been freshly seeded . Outside the stadium , kids threw rocks , and Chick Cassady , the Airplane 's manager , allegedly encouraged the youngsters to do battle with the police . When the tear gas cleared , the cops had arrested Cassady , the Airplane 's Paul Kantner and Kantner 's " old lady " Grace Slick , who either attacked the fuzz or-depending on who was telling the story-was attacked by them . The three paid a $1,400 bond and promised to show up for a September trial " because we 're not guilty and , besides , this could happen to any other group that comes into Akron . " <P> " I 'm not kidding , " said South African Golfer Gary Player . " We 've had a baby after every one of my major victories . " As if to prove his point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America championship-his sixth major win-and phoned Wife Vivienne to ask if she was pregnant . " No , " replied Vivienne , an answer that soon proved premature . Now , says Player , his record still holds . The couple 's sixth child will be along in April . <P> " I was never Hitler 's mistress-though I was dazzled by him , like millions of other Germans . These are nothing but lies , " insists Leni Riefenstahl , with thinning patience . As one of Adolf Hitler 's favorite actresses and directors , Leni got her biggest break when the Fhrer told her to make a movie of the 1936 Berlin Olympics . The film that resulted was a propaganda classic , but her career as a movie producer in the Third Reich eventually led to two denazification trials ( she was cleared ) . Now London 's Sunday Times has hired her to put her 1936 experience to use photographing the XX Olympiad in Munich , and Leni plans no propaganda . " I have always loved the world and all races , " she says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Underneath the lantern , by the barracks gate , <P> Darling , I remember the way you used to wait : <P> ' T was there that you whispered tenderly <P> That you loved me , you 'd always be <P> My Lilli of the lamplight , <P> My own Lilli Marlene . <P> Some thought Lilli Marlene was a respectable girl who was bidding goodbye to a drafted soldier ; others suspected that she lounged around lanterns for immoral purposes . No matter . The lament that began as the signing-off tune of Nazi-occupied Radio Belgrade eventually crossed Allied lines , was translated into 42 languages and became the great hit of World War II . German Singer Lale Andersen , whose sensuous , never-never-land tones made the record so popular , is now retired , but last week , at 59 , she published her memoirs , recalling her surprise at Lilli 's phenomenal success . To commemorate the lamplight girl 's international appeal , the publishers threw a party aboard a Russian tourist steamer docked in Vienna on its way to Germany . " If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " observed Miss Andersen . " I 've never been there . "
