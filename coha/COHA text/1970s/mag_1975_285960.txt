If Democrat Hugh Carey was an obscure politician before his election as New York 's Governor last year , his oilman brother Edward was almost invisible . Yet had it not been for Edward , Hugh Carey might not be in office at all . As the secretive , quietly ambitious chief and sole owner of the sprawling Carey Energy Corp. , Edward Michael Carey bankrolled his brother 's campaign to the tune of $1 million . <P> For Ed Carey , the largesse . was effortless . He will not disclose his net worth , but Wall Street sources put it at between $200 million and $250 million . That easily ranks the white-haired , 58-year-old Carey ( two years older than Hugh ) among the 100 or so richest men in the U.S. His company 's annual sales are estimated at around $1.25 billion , making it the 23rd largest oil company in the U.S. It certainly is one of the world 's largest companies owned by one person . While there are some unexercised stock options held by a few key executives , Carey personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under Scrutiny . Consisting of New England Petroleum Corp . and some 40 affiliates , Carey 's company supplies oil to New York State utilities and others along the Eastern seaboard . It also explores in the North Sea , pumps crude in Abu Dhabi , refines in the Bahamas , ships round the world by tanker , truck and pipeline , and owns storage terminals with a capacity of 25 million bbl . Most of the Carey Corp . ' s business is with industrial customers . But a subsidiary , Burns Bros. , supplies heating oil to New York metropolitan-area homes . In Canada , the group 's Caloil affiliate sells gasoline under the Calex sign at 250 service stations . <P> Carey 's political activity was minimal until his brother decided to run for <P> Governor . Ed contributed nominally to Richard Nixon 's 1972 campaign- " not that I thought he was any great man , " he says , " but the other fellow George McGovern sure looked wild-eyed . " Throughout Hugh Carey 's campaign , there were accusations by opponents that Ed was buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public attention on the oil executive for the first time . Currently , Carey is under scrutiny for other reasons . The Federal Energy Administration is looking into allegations that Carey and other oil companies made excessive profits during the crisis winter of 1973-74 by buying oil cheap and selling it at inflated prices . For his part , the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York cleared Carey after an investigation . But there is also an allegation that Edward used the influence of his brother , then a member of the House Ways and Means Committee , to gain approval for an oil deal . Hugh , who himself has asked the Attorney General to look into the case , last week demanded that all records of communications between his old congressional office and the former Federal ' nergy Office , where he is alleged to have brought pressure to bear on behalf of his brother , be made public .
