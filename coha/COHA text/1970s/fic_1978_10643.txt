it all . The watch would work perfectly , he had thought about the player to an extraordinary degree . More than anything else was the feeling of personal friendship . Gronevelt had a gift for exuding affection when he presented one of these tokens of his esteem which made it even more flattering . And Gronevelt used " The Pencil " liberally . Big players were , of course , comped , RFB  --  free room , food and beverage . But Groneveltalso granted this privilege to five-dollar chip bettors who were wealthy . He was a master at turning these customers into big players . Another lesson Gronevelt taught Cully was not to hustle young girls . Gronevelt had been indignant . He had lectured Cully severely . " Where the fuck do you come off bullshitting those kids out of a piece of ass ? Are you a fucking sneak thief ? Would you go into their purses and snatch their small change ? What kind of guy are you ? Would you steal their car ? Would you go into their house as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come off stealing their cunt ? That 's their only capital , especially when they 're beautiful . And remember once you slip them that Honeybee , you 're evened out with them . You 're free . No bullshit about a relationship . No bullshit about marriage or divorcing your wife . No asking for thousand-dollar loans . Or being faithful . And remember for five of those Honeybees , she 'll always be available , even on her wedding day . " Cully had been amused by this outburst . Obviously Gronevelt had heard about his operation with women , but just as obviously Gronevelt did n't understand women as well as he , Cully , did . Groneveltdid n't understand their masochism . Their willingness , their need to believe in a con job . But he did n't protest . He did say wryly , " It 's not as easy as you make it out to be , even your way . With some of them a thousand Honeybees do n't help . " And surprisingly Gronevelt laughed and agreed . He even told a funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Texas woman worth many millions had gambled in the casino and he had presented her with an antique Japanese fan that cost him fifty dollars . The Texas heiress , a good-looking woman of forty and a widow , fell in love with him . Gronevelt was horrified . Though he was ten years older than she , he liked pretty young girls . But out ofp201duty to the hotel bankroll he had taken her up to the hotel suite one night and went to bed with her . When she left , out of habit and perhaps out of foolish perversity or perhaps with the cruel Vegas sense of fun , he slipped her a Honeybee and told her to buy herself a present . To this day he did n't know why . The oil heiress had looked down at the Honeybee and slipped it into her purse . She thanked him prettily . She continued to come to the hotel and gamble , but she was no longer in love with him . Three years later Gronevelt was looking for investors to build additional rooms to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable . " Players gamble where they shit , " he said . " They do n't go wandering around . Give them a show room , a lounge show , different restaurants . Keep them in the hotel the first forty-eight hours . By then they 're banged out . " He had approached the oil heiress . She had nodded and said of course . She immediately wrote out a check and handed it to him with an extraordinarily sweet smile . The check was for a hundred dollars . " The moral of that story , " Gronevelt said , " is never treat a smart rich broad like a dumb poor cunt . " Sometimes in LA Gronevelt would go shopping for old books . But usually , when he was in the mood , he would fly to Chicago to attend a rare books auction . He had a fine collection stored in a locked glass-paneled bookcase in his suite . When Cully moved into his new office , he found a present from Gronevelt : a first edition of a book on gambling published in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his desk for a while . Then , not knowing what to do with it , he brought it into Gronevelt 's suite and gave it back to him . " I appreciate the gift , but it 's wasted on me , " he said . Gronevelt nodded and did n't say anything . Cully felt that he had disappointed him , but in a curious way it helped cement their relationship . A few days later he saw the book in Gronevelt 's special locked case . He knew then that he had not made a mistake , and he felt pleased that Gronevelt had tendered him such a genuine mark of affection , however misguided . But then he saw another side of Gronevelt that he had always known must exist . Cully had made it a habit to be present when the casino chipsp202were counted three times a day . He accompanied the pit bosses as they counted the chips on all the tables , blackjack , roulette , craps , and the cash at baccarat . He even went into the casino cage to count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little nervous to Cully 's eyes , but he dismissed this as his own suspicious nature because the cash and markers and chips in the safe always tallied correctly . And the casino cage manager was an old trusted member of Gronevelt 's early days . But one day , on some impulse , Cully decided to have the trays of chips pulled out of the safe . He could never figure out this impulse later . But once the scores of metal racks had been taken out of the darkness of the safe and closely inspected it became obvious that two trays of the black hundred-dollar chips were false . They were blank black cylinders . In the darkness of the safe , thrust far in the back where they would never be used , they had been passed as legitimate on the daily counts . The casino cage manager professed horror and shock , but they both knew that the scam could never have been attempted without his consent . Cully picked up a phone and called Gronevelt 's suite . Gronevelt immediately came down to the cage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred thousand dollars . Gronevelt pointed a finger at the cage manager . It was a dreadful moment . Gronevelt 's ruddy , tanned face was white , but his voice was composed . " Get the fuck out of this cage , " he said . Then he turned to Cully . " Make him sign over all his keys to you , " he said . " And then have all the pit bosses on all three of the shifts in my office right away . I do n't give a fuck where they are . The ones who are on vacation fly back to Vegas and check in with me as soon as they get here . " Then Gronevelt walked out of the cage and disappeared . As Cully and the casino cage manager were doing the paperwork for signing over the keys , two men Cully had never seen before came in . The casino cage manager knew them because he turned very pale and his hands started shaking uncontrollably . Both men nodded to him and he nodded back . One of the men said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see you up in his office . " They were talking to the cage manager and ignored Cully . Cully picked up the phone and called Gronevelt 's office . He said to Gronevelt , " Two guys came down here , they say you sent them . "  |p203Gronevelt  's voice was like ice . " That 's right , " he said . " Just checking , " Cully said . Gronevelt 's voice softened . " Good idea , he said . " And you did a good job . " There was a slight pause . " The rest of it is none of your business , Cully . Forget about it . Understand ? " His voice was almost gentle now , and there was even a note of weary sadness in it . The cage manager was seen for the next few days around Las Vegas and then disappeared . After a month Cully learned that his wife had put in a missing persons report on him . He could n't believe the implication at first , despite the jokes he heard around town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He never dared mention anything to Gronevelt , and Gronevelt never spoke of the matter to him . Not even to compliment him upon his good work . Which was just as well . Cully did n't want to think that his good work might have resulted in the cage manager 's being buried in the desert . But in the last few months Gronevelt had shown his mettle in a less macabre way . With typical Vegas nimbleness of foot and quick-wittedness . All the casino owners in Vegas had started making a big pitch for foreign gamblers . The English were immediately written off , despite their history of being the biggest losers of the nineteenth century . The end of the British Empire had meant the end of their high rollers . The millions of Indians , Australians , South Sea Islandersand Canadians no longer poured money into the coffers of the gambling milords . England was now a poor country , whose very rich scrambled to beat taxes and hold on to their estates . Those few who could afford to gamble preferred the aristocratic high-toned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The French were also written off . The French did n't travel and would never stand for the extra house double zero on the Vegas wheel . But the Germans and Italians were wooed . Germany with its expanding postwar economy had many millionaires , and Germans loved to travel , loved to gamble and loved the Vegas women . There was something in the high-flying Vegas style that appealed to thep204Teutonic spirit , that brought back memories of Oktoberfest and maybe even Gotterdammerung . The Germans were also goodnaturedgamblers and more skillful than most . Italian millionaires were big prizes in Vegas . They gambled recklessly while getting drunk ; they let the soft hustlers employed by casinos keep them in the city a suicidal six or seven days . They seemed to have inexhaustible sums of money because none of them paid income tax . What should have gone into the public coffers of Rome slid into the hold boxes of air-conditioned casinos . The girls of Vegas loved the Italian millionaires because of their generous gifts and because for those six or seven days they fell in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bets at the crap table . The Mexican and South American gamblers were even bigger prizes . Nobody knew what was really going on down in South America , but special planes were sent there to bring the pampas millionaires to Vegas . Everything was free to these sporting gentlemenwho left the hides of millions of cattle at the baccarat tables . They came with their wives and girlfriends , their adolescent sons eager to become gambling men . These customers too were favorites of the Las Vegas girls . They were less sincere than the Italians , perhaps a little less polished in their lovemaking according to some reports , but certainly with larger appetites . Cully had been in Gronevelt 's office one day when the casino manager came with a special problem . A South American gambler , a premier player , had put in a request for eight girls to be sent to his suite , blondes , redheads but no brunettes and none shorter than his own five feet six inches . Gronevelt took the request coolly . " And what time today does he want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About five o'clock , " the casino manager said . " He wants to take them all to dinner afterward and keep them for the night . " Gronevelt did n't crack a smile . " What will it cost ? " " About three grand , " the casino manager said . " The girls know they 'll get roulette and baccarat money from this guy . " " OK , comp it , " Gronevelt said . " But tell those girls to keep him in the hotel as much as possible . I do n't want him losing his dough down the Strip . "  |p205As  the casino manager started to leave , Gronevelt said . " What the hell is he going to do with eight women ? " The casino manager shrugged . " I asked him the same thing . He says he has his son with him . " For the first time in the conversation , Gronevelt smiled . " That 's what I call real paternal pride , " he said . Then , after the casino manager left the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember , they gamble where they shit and where they fuck . When the father dies , the son will keep coming here . For three grand he 'll have a night he 'll never forget . He 'll be worth a million bucks to the Xanadu unless they have a revolution in his country . " But the prize , the champions , the pearl without price that every casino owner coveted were the Japanese . They were hair-raising gamblers , and they always arrived in Vegas in groups . The top echelon of an industrial combine would arrive to gamble tax-free dollars , and their losses in a four-day stay many times went over a million dollars . And it was Cully who snared the biggest Japanese prize for the Xanadu Hotel and Gronevelt . Cully had been carrying on a friendly **38;5784;TOOLONG affair with a dancer in the Oriental Follies playing a Strip hotel . The girl was called Daisy because her Japanese name was unpronounceable , and she was only about twenty years old , but she had been in Vegas for nearly five years . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its shell , but she was thinking about getting operations to make her eyes Occidental and her bust puffed to corn-fed American . Cully was horrified and told her she would ruin her appeal . Daisy finally listened to his advice only when he pretended an ecstasy greater than he felt for her budlike breasts . They became such friends that she gave him lessons in Japanese while they were in bed and he stayed overnight . In the mornings she would serve him soup for breakfast , and when he protested , she told him that in Japan everyone ate soup for breakfast and that she made the best breakfast soup in her village outside Tokyo . Cully was astonished to find the soup delicious and tangy and easy on the stomach after a fatiguing night of drinking and making love . It was Daisy who alerted him to the fact that one of the great business tycoons of Japan was planning to visit Vegas . Daisy hadp206Japanese newspapers airmailed to her by her family ; she was homesick and enjoyed reading about Japan . She told Cully that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview stating that he would come to America to open up overseas branches of his television manufacturing business . Daisy said that Mr. Fummiro was famous in Japan for being an outrageous gambler and would surely come to Vegas . She also told him that Mr. Fummiro was a pianist of great skill , had studied in Europe and would almost certainly have become a professional musician if his father had not ordered his son to take over the family firm . That day Cully had Daisy come over to his office at the Xanadu and dictated a latter for her to write on the hotel stationery . With Daisy 's advice he constructed a letter that observed the , to Occidentals , subtle politesse of Japan and would not give Mr. Fummiro offense . In the letter he invited Mr. Fummiro to be an honored guest at the Xanadu Hotel for as long as he wished and at any time he wished . He also invited Mr. Fummiro to bring as many guests as he desired , his whole entourage , including his business colleagues in the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this would not cost him one cent . That even the theater shows would be free . Before he mailed the letter , Cully got Gronevelt 's approval since Cully still did not have the full authority of " The Pencil . " Cully had been afraid that Gronevelt would sign the letter , but this did not happen . So now officially these Japanese were Cully 's clients , if they came . He would be their " Host . " It was three weeks before he received an answer . And during that time Cully put in some more time studying with Daisy . He learned that he must always smile while talking to a Japanese client . That he always had to show the utmost courtesy in voice and gesture . She told him that when a slight hiss came into the speech of a Japanese man , it was a sign of anger , a danger signal . Like the rattle of a snake . Cully remembered that hiss in the speech of Japanese villains in WW II movies . He had thought it was just the mannerisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came , it was in the form of a phone call from Mr. Fummiro 's overseas branch office in Losp207Angeles . Could the Xanadu Hotel have two suites ready for Mr. Fummiro , the president of Japan Worldwide Sales Company and his executive vice-president , Mr. Niigeta ? Plus another ten rooms for other members of Mr. Fummiro 's entourage ? The call had been routed to Cully since he had been specifically asked for , and he answered yes . Then , wild with joy , he immediately called Daisy , and told her he would take her shopping in the next few days . He told her he would get Mr. Fummiro ten suites to make all the members of his entourage comfortable . She told him not to do so . That it would make Mr. Fummiro lose face if the rest of his party had equal accommodations . Then Cully asked Daisy to go out that very day and fly to Los Angeles to buy kimonos that Mr. Fummiro could wear in the privacy of his suite . She told him that this too would offend Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he surely wore the comfortable Japanese traditional garments in the privacy of his own home . Cully , desperately seeking for every angle to get an edge , suggested that Daisy meet Mr. Fummiro and perhaps act as his interpreter and dinner companion . Daisy laughed and said that would be the last thing Mr. Fummiro would want . He would be extremely uncomfortable with a Westernized Japanese girl observing him in this foreign country . Cully accepted all her decisions . But one thing he insisted on . He told Daisy to make fresh Japanese soup during Mr. Fummiro 's three day stay . Cully would come to her apartment early every morning to pick it up and have it delivered to Mr. Fummiro 's suite when he ordered breakfast . Daisy groaned but promised to do so . Late that afternoon Cully got a call from Gronevelt . " What the hell is a piano doing in Suite Four ten ? " Gronevelt said . " I just got a call from the hotel manager . He said you bypassed channels and caused a hell of a mess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special tastes . Gronevelt chuckled and said , " Take my Rolls when you pick him up at the airport . " This was a car he used only for the richest of Texas millionaires or his favorite clients that he personally " Hosted . " The next day Cully was at the airport with three bellmen from the hotel , the chauffeured Rolls and two Cadillac limos . Hep208arranged for the Rolls and the limousines to go directly onto the flying field so that his clients would not have to go through the terminal . And he greeted Mr. Fummiro as soon as he came down the steps of the plane . The party of Japanese was unmistakable not only for their features but because of the way they dressed . They were all in black business suits , badly tailored by Western standards , with white shirts and black ties . The ten of them looked like a band of very earnest clerks instead of the ruling board of Japan 's richest and most powerful business conglomerate . Mr. Fummiro was also easy to pick out . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a good five feet ten . And he was handsome with wide massive features , broad shoulders and jet black hair . He could have passed for a movie star out of Hollywoodcast in an exotic role that made him look falsely Oriental . For a brief second the thought flashed through Cully 's mind that this might be an elaborate scam . Of the others only one stood close to Fummiro . He was slightly shorter than Fummiro , but much thinner . And he had the buckteethof the caricature Japanese . The remaining men were tiny and inconspicuous . All of them carried elegant black imitation samite briefcases . Cully extended his hand with utmost assurance to Fummiro and said , " I 'm Cully Cross of the Xanadu Hotel . Welcome to Las Vegas . " Mr. Fummiro flashed a brilliantly polite smile . His white teeth . were large and perfect , and he said in only slightly accented English , " Very pleased to meet you . " Then he introduced the buck-toothed man as Mr. Niigeta , his executive vice-president . He murmured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands with Cully . Cully took their baggage tickets and assured them all luggage would be delivered to their rooms in the hotel . He ushered them into the waiting cars . He and Fummiro and Niigeta into the Rolls , the others into the Cadillacs . On the way to the hotel he told his passengers that credit had been arranged . Fummiro patted Niigeta 's briefcase and said in his slightly imperfectEnglish , " We have brought you cash money . " The two menp209smiled at Cully . Cully smiled back . He remembered to smile whenever he spoke as he told them all the conveniences of the hotel and how they could see any show in Vegas . For a fraction of a second he thought about mentioning the companionship of women , but some instinct made him hold back . At the hotel he led them directly to their rooms and had a desk clerk bring up the registration forms for them to sign . All were on the same floor , Fummiro and Niigeta had adjoining suites with a connecting door . Fummiro inspected the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glint of satisfaction in his eyes when he noted that his own suite was by far the best . But Fummiro 's eyes really lit up when he saw the small piano in his suite . He immediately sat down and fingered the keys , listening . Cully hoped that it was in tune . He could n't tell , but Fummiro vigorously nodded his head and , smiling broadly and face alight with pleasure , said , " Very good , very kind , " and shook Cully 's hand effusively . Then Fummiro motioned to Niigeta to open the briefcase he was carrying . Cully 's eyes bulged a little . There were neatly banded stacks of currency filling the case . He had no idea how much it might be . " We would like to leave this on deposit in your casino cage , " Mr. Fummiro said . " Then we can just draw the money as we need it for our little vacation . " " Certainly , " Cully said . Niigeta snapped the case shut , and the two of them went down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to freshen up . They went into the casino manager 's office , where the money was counted out . It came to five hundred thousand dollars . Cully made sure Niigeta was given the proper receipt and the necessary clerical work done so that the money could be drawn on demand at the tables . The casino manager himself would be on the floor with Cully and would identify Fummiro and Niigeta to the pit bosses and the floorwalkers . Then in every corner of the casino the two Japanese merely had to lift a finger and draw chips , then sign a marker . Without fuss , without showing identification . And they would get the royal treatment , the utmost deference . A deference especially pure since it related only to money . For the next three days Cully was at the hotel early in thep210morning with Daisy 's breakfast soup . Room service had orders to notify him as soon as Mr. Fummiro called down for his breakfast . Cully would give him an hour to eat and then knock on his door to say good morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing soulfully , the serving bowl of soup empty on the table behind him . In these morning meetings Cully arranged show tickets and sightseeing trips for Mr. Fummiro and his friends . Mr. Fummirowas always smilingly polite and grateful , and Mr. Niigeta would come through the connecting door from his own suite to greet Cully and compliment him on the breakfast soup , which he had obviously shared . Cully remembered to keep smiling and noddinghis head as they did . Meanwhile , in their three days ' gambling in Vegas the band of ten Japanese terrorized the casinos of Vegas . They would travel together and gamble together at the same baccarat table . When Fummiro had the shoe , they all bet the limit with him on the Bank . They had some hot streaks but luckily not at the Xanadu . They only bet baccarat , and they played with a joie de vivre more Italian than Oriental . Fummiro would whip the sides of the shoe and bang the table when he dealt himself a natural eight or nine . He was a passionate gambler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knew Fummiro was worth over half a billion dollars . Why should such paltry ( though up to the Vegas limit ) gambling excite him ? Only once did he see the steel behind Fummiro 's handsome smiling facade . One night Niigeta placed a bet on Player 's when Fummiro had the shoe . Fummiro gave him a long look , eyebrows arching , and said something in Japanese . For the first time Cully caught the slight hissing sound that Daisy had warned him against . Niigeta stuttered something in apology through his buckteeth and immediately switched his money to ride with Fummiro . The trip was a huge success for everybody . Fummiro and his band went back to Japan ahead over a hundred thousand dollars , but they had lost two hundred thousand to the Xanadu . They had made up for their losses at other casinos . And they had started a legend in Vegas . The band of ten men in their shiny black suits would leave one casino for another down the Strip . They were a frightening sight , marching ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collect the corpse of the casino 's bankroll . Thep211baccarat pit boss would learn from the Rolls driver where they were going and call that casino to expect them and give them redcarpettreatment . All the pit bosses pooled their information . It was in this way that Cully learned that Niigeta was a horny Oriental and getting laid by top-class hookers at the other hotels . Which meant that for some reason he did n't want Fummiro to know that he would rather fuck than gamble . Cully took them to the airport when they left for Los Angeles . He had one of Gronevelt 's antique gold fob watches which he presented to Fummiro with Gronevelt 's compliments . Gronevelt himself had briefly stopped at the Japanese dining table to introducehimself and show the courtesies of the house . Fummiro was genuinely effusive in his thanks , and Cully went through the usual rounds of handshakes and smiles before they got on their plane . Cully rushed back to the hotel , made a phone call to get the piano moved out of Fummiro 's suite and then went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handshake and a congratulatory hug . " One of the best Host ' jobs I 've seen in all my years in Vegas , " Gronevelt said . " Where did you find out about that soup bus-iness ? " " A little girl named Daisy , " Cully said . " OK if I buy her a present from the hotel ? " " You can go for a grand , " Gronevelt said . " That 's a very nice connection you made with those Japs . Keep after them . The special Christmas gifts and invitations . That guy Fummiro is a bust-out gambler if I ever saw one . " Cully frowned . " I was a little leery about laying on broads , " he said . " You know Fummiro is a hell of a nice guy , and I did n't want to get too familiar first time out . " Gronevelt nodded . " You were right . Do n't worry , he 'll be back . And if he wants a broad , he 'll ask for one . You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Gronevelt as usual was right . Three months later Fummiro was back and at the cabaret show asked about one of the leggy blondp212dancers . Cully knew she was in action despite being married to a dealer at the Sands . After the show he called the stage manager and asked him if the girl would have a drink with Fummiro and him . It was arranged , and Fummiro asked the girl out for a latenightdinner . The girl looked questioningly at Cully and he nodded . Then he left them alone . He went to his office and called the stage manager to tell him to schedule a replacement for the midnight show . The next morning Cully did not go up to Fummiro'ssuite after breakfast was delivered . Later in the day he called the girl at her home and told her she could miss all her shows while Fummiro was in town . On subsequent trips the pattern remained the same . By this time Daisy had taught one of the Xanadu chefs how to make the Japanese soup , and it was officially listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Fummiro always watched the reruns of a certain long-lasting western TV show . He loved it . Especially the blond ingenue who played a plucky but very feminine , yet innocent dance hall girl . Cully had a brainstorm . Through his movie contacts he got in touch with the ingenue , who was named Linda Parsons . He flew into Los Angeles , had lunch with her and told her about Fummiro 's passion for her and her show . She was fascinated by Cully 's stories about Fummiro 's gambling . How he checked into the Xanadu with briefcases holding a million dollars in cash , which he would sometimes lose in three days of baccarat . Cully could see the childish , innocent greed in her eyes . She told Cully that she would love to come to Vegas the next time Fummiro arrived . A month later Fummiro and Niigeta checked into the Xanadu Hotel for a four-day stay . Cully immediately told Fummiro about Linda Parsons ' wishing to visit him . Fummiro 's eyes lit up . Despite being over forty , he had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more charming . He asked Cully to call the girl immediately , and Cully said he would , not mentioning that he had already spoken to her and she had promised to come into town the next afternoon . Fummiro was so excited that he gambled like a madman that night and dropped over three hundred thousand dollars . The next morning Fummiro went shopping for a new blue suit . For some reason he thought blue suits were the height of Americanp213elegance , and Cully arranged with the Sy Devore people at the Sands Hotel to measure and fit him out and specially tailor it for him that day . Cully sent one of his Xanadu " Hosts " with Fummiro to make sure everything went smoothly . But Linda Parsons caught an early plane and arrived in Vegas before noon . Cully met her plane and brought her to the hotel . She wanted to freshen up for Fummiro 's arrival , so Cully put her in Niigeta 's suite since he assumed that Niigeta was with his chief . It proved to be an almost fatal error . Leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office and tried to locate Fummiro , but he had left the tailor shop and must have stopped off in one of the casinos along the way to gamble . He could not be traced . After about an hour he received a phone call from Fummiro 's suite . It was Linda Parsons . She sounded a little upset . " Could you come down ? " she said . " I 'm having a language problem with your friend . " Cully did n't wait to ask any questions . Fummiro spoke English well enough ; for some reason he was pretending not to be able to . Maybe he was disappointed in the girl . Cully had noticed that the ingenue , in person , had more mileage on her than appeared in the carefully photographed TV shows . Or maybe Linda had said or done something that had offended his delicate Oriental sensibilites . But it was Niigeta who let him into the suite . And Niigeta was preening himself with slighly drunken pride . Then Cully saw Linda Parsons come out of the bathroom clad in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jesus Christ , " Cully said . Linda gave him a wan smile . " You sure bullshitted me , " she said . " He 's not that shy and he 's not that good-looking and does n't even understand English . I hope he 's rich at least . " Niigeta was still smiling and preening , he even bowed toward Linda as she was talking . He had obviously not understood what she was saying . " Did you fuck him ? " Cully asked almost in despair . Linda made a face . " He kept chasing me around the suite . I thought at least we 'd have a romantic evening together with flowers and violins , but I could n't fight him off . So I figured what the hell . Let 's get it over with if he 's such a horny Jap . So I fucked him . " Cully shook his head and said , " You fucked the wrong Jap. "  |p214Linda  looked at him for a moment with a mixture of shock and horror . Then she burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She fell onto the sofa still laughing , her white thigh bared by the flopping of the kimono . For that moment Cully was charmed by her . But then he shook his head . This was serious . He picked up the phone and got Daisy at her apartment . The first thing Daisy said was , " No more soup . " Cully told her to stop kidding around and to get down to the hotel . He told her it was terribly important and she had to be fast . Then he called Gronevelt and explained the situation . Gronevelt said he would come right down . Meanwhile , Cully was praying that Fummiro would not appear . Fifteen minutes later Gronevelt and Daisy were in the suite with them . Linda had made Cully and Niigeta and herself a drink from the suite bar , and she still had a grin on her face . Gronevelt was charming with her . " I 'm sorry this happened , " he said . " But just be a little patient . We 'll get everything sorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Explain to Mr. Niigeta exactly what happened . That he took Mr. Fummiro 's woman . That she thought he was Mr. Fummiro . Explain that Mr. Fummiro was madly in love with her and went out to buy a new suit for his meeting with her . " Niigeta was listening intently with the same broad grin he always wore . But now there was a little alarm in his eyes . He asked Daisy a question in Japanese , and Cully noticed the little warning hiss in his speech . Daisy started talking to him rapidly in Japanese . She kept smiling as she talked , but Niigeta 's smile kept fading as her words poured out , and when she finished , he fell to the floor of the suite in a dead faint . Daisy took charge . She grabbed a whiskey bottle and poured some down Niigeta 's throat , then helped him up and to the sofa . Linda looked at him pityingly . Niigeta was wringing his hands and pouring out speech to Daisy . Gronevelt asked what he was saying . Daisy shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career . He says that Mr. Fummiro will get rid of him . That he made Mr. Fummiro lose too much face . " Gronevelt nodded . " Tell him to just keep his mouth shut . Tell him I 'm going to have him put into the hospital for a day because he 's feeling ill , and then he 'll fly back to Los Angeles for treatment.  |p215We  'll make up a story for Mr. Fummiro . Tell him never to tell a soul , and we 'll make sure that Mr. Fummiro never finds out what happened . " Daisy translated and Niigeta nodded . His polite smile came back , but it was a ghastly grimace . Gronevelt turned to Cully . " You and Miss Parsons wait for Fummiro . Act as if nothing happened . I 'll take care of Niigeta . We ca n't leave him here ; he 'll faint again when he sees his boss . I 'll ship him out . " And that was how it worked . When Fummiro finally arrived an hour later , he found Linda Parsons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Cully . Fummiro was immediately enchanted , and Linda Parsons looked smitten with his handsomeness but as innocently as the ingenue of the western TV movie could be . " I hope you do n't mind , " she said . " But I took your friend 's suite so that I could be right next to you . That way we can spend more time with each other . " Fummiro grasped the implication . She was not just some slut who would move right in with him . She would have to fall in love first . He nodded with a broad smile and said , " Of course , of course . " Cully heaved a sigh of relief . Linda was playing her cards just right . He said his good-byes and lingered for a moment in the hall . In a few minutes he could hear Fummiro playing the piano and Linda singing along with him . In the three days that followed Fummiro and Linda Parsons had the classical , almost geometrically perfect Las Vegas love affair . They were mad for each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gambling tables good luck or bad , shopping in the fancy arcades and boutiques of the Strip hotels . Linda loved Japanese soup for breakfast and loved Fummiro 's piano playing . I.ummiro loved Linda 's blond paleness , her milk-white and slightly heavy thighs , the longness of her legs , the soft , drooping fullness of her breasts . But most of all , he loved her constant good humor , her gaiety . He confided to Cully that Linda would have made a great geisha . Daisy told Cully that this was the highest compliment a man like Fummiro. could give . Fummiro also claimed that Linda gave him luck when he gambled . When his stay was over , he had lost only two hundred thousand of the million in cash , American , that he had deposited in the casino cage . And that included a minkp216coat , a diamond ring , a palomino horse and a Mercedes car that he bought for Linda Parsons . He had gotten away cheap . Without Linda the chances were good he would have dropped at least half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baccarat tables . At first Cully thought of Linda as a high-class soft hooker . But after Fummiro left Vegas , he had dinner with her before she took the night plane to Los Angeles . She was really crazy about Fummiro . " He 's such an interesting guy , " she said . " I loved that soup for breakfast and the piano playing . And he was just great in bed . No wonder the Japanese women do everything for their men . " Cully smiled . " I do n't think he treats his women back home the way he treated you . " Linda sighed . " Yeah , I know . Still , it was great . You know , he took hundreds of pictures of me with his camera . You 'd think I 'd be tired of that , but I really loved him doing it . I took pictures of him too . He 's a very handsome man . " " And very rich , " Cully said , Linda shrugged . " I 've been with rich guys before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a little kid . I really do n't like the way he gambles , though . God ! I could live for ten years on what he loses in one day . " Cully thought , is that so ? And immediately made plans for Fummiro and Linda Parsons never to meet again . But he said with a wry smile , " Yeah , I hate to see him get hurt like that . Might discourage him from gambling . " Linda grinned at him . " Yeah , I 'll bet , " she said . " But thanks for everything . I really had one of the best times of my life . Maybe I 'll see you again . " He knew what she was angling for , but instead , he said smoothly , " Anytime you get the yen for Vegas just call me . Everythingon the house except chips . " Linda said a little pensively , " Do you think Fummiro will call me the next time he comes in ? I gave him my phone number in LA . I even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we finish taping the show , and he said he 'd be delighted and to let him know when I was coming . But he was a little cool about that . " Cully shook his head . " Japanese men do n't like women to be so aggressive . They 're a thousand years behind the times . Especially ap217big wheel like Fummiro . Your best bet is to lay back and play it cool . " She sighed . " I guess so . " He took her to the airport and kissed her on the cheek before she boarded her plane . " I 'll give you a call when Fummiro comes in again , " he said . When he got back to the Xanadu , he went up to Gronevelt 's living suite and said wryly , " There 's such a thing as being too good to a player . " Gronevelt said , " Do n't be disappointed . We did n't want his whole million this early in the game . But you 're right . That actress is not the right girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not greedy enough . For another , she 's too straight . And worst of all , she 's intelligent . " " How do you know ? " Cully asked . Gronevelt smiled . " Am I right ? " " Sure , " Cully said . " I 'll make sure to tout Fummiro off her when he comes in again . " " You wo n't have to , " Gronevelt said . " A guy like him has too much strength . He does n't need what she can give him . Not more than once . Once is fun . But that 's all it was . If it were more , he would have taken better care of her when he left . " Cully was a little startled . " A Mercedes , a mink coat and a diamond ring ? That 's not taking care of her ? " " Nope , " Gronevelt said . And he was right . The next time Fummirocame into Vegas he never asked about Linda Parsons . And this time he lost his million cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stewardess came around with coffee and breakfast . Cully kept the suitcase beside him as he ate and drank , and when he had finished , he saw New York 's towers of steel on the horizon . The sight always awed him . As the desert stretched away from Vegas , so here the miles of steel and glass rooted and growing thickly toward the sky seemed limitless . And gave him a sense of despair . The plane dipped and did a slow , graceful tilt to the left as it circled the city and then dropped down , white ceiling to blue ceiling , then to sunlit air with the cement gray runways and scattered green patches that formed the carpet earth . It touched down with a hard enough bump to wake those passengers who were still asleep . Cully felt fresh and wide-awake . He was anxious to see Merlyn ; the thought of it made him feel happy . Good old Merlyn , the original square , the only man in the world he trusted.  |p221ON  the day that I was to appear before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ninth grade and entering high school . Valerie wanted me to take off from work and go with her to the exercises . I told her I could n't because I had to go to a special meeting on the Army recall program . She still had no clue to the trouble I was in , and I did n't tell her . She could n't help and she could only worry . If everything went OK , she 'd never know . And that was how I wanted it . I really did n't believe in sharing troubles with marriage partners when they could n't help . Valerie was proud of her son 's graduating day . A few years ago we realized he really could n't read , yet was getting promoted each semester . Valerie was mad as hell and started teaching him to read , and she did a good job . Now he was getting top grades . Not that I was n't mad . It was another grudge I had against New York City . We lived in a low-income area , all working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shit whether the kids learned anything or not . It just kept promoting them on to get rid of them , to get them out of the system without any trouble and with the least amount of effort . Vallie was looking forward to moving into our new house . It was in a great school district , a Long Island community where the teachers made sure all their students qualified for college . Andp222though she did n't say it , there were hardly any blacks . Her kids would grow up in the same kind of , to her , stable environment she had had as a Catholic schoolchild . That was OK with me . I did n't want to tell her that the problems she was trying to escape were rooted in the illnesses of our entire society and that we would n't escape them in the trees and lawns of Long Island . And besides , I had other worries . I might be going to jail instead . It depended on the grand jury I would appear before today . Everything depended on that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . Vallie was taking the kids to school herself and staying there for the graduation exercises . I told her that I was going into work late , so they left before me . I got my own coffee , and as I drank it , I figured out all the things I had to do before the grand jury . I had to deny everything . There was no way they could trace the bribe money I 'd taken , Cully had assured me of that . But the thing that worried me was that I had had to fill out a questionnaire as to my assets . One question was did I own a house . And I had walked a thin line on that . The truth was that I had put a down payment on a Long Island home , a deposit , but there had not yet been a " closing " on the house . So I just said no . I figured I did n't own a house and there was nothing said about a deposit . But I wondered if the FBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . So one of the questions I could expect the grand jury to ask would be if I had made a deposit on a house . And then I would have to answer yes . Then they would ask me why I had n't put it down on the sheet and I would have to expain that . Then what if Frank Alcore cracked and pleaded guilty and told them about our dealings when we had been partners ? I had already made up my mind to lie about that . It would be Frank 's word against mine . He had always handled the deals by himself , nobody could back him up . And now I remembered one day when one of his customers had tried to pay me off with an envelope to deliver to Frank because Frank was not in the office that day . I had refused . And that had been very lucky . Because that customer was one of the guys who had written the anonymous letter to the FBI that started the whole investigation . And that had been pure luck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally . Well , hep223would have to testify that I would n't take the money and that would be a point in my favor . And would Frank crack and throw me to the grand jury ? I did n't think so . The only way he could save himself would be to give evidence against someone higher up in the chain of command . Like the major or the colonel . And the catch there was that they were not involved at all . And I felt Frank was too decent a guy to cause me grief just because he was caught . Besides , he had too much at stake . If he pleaded guilty , he would lose his government job and pension and his Reserve rank and pension . He had to brazen it out . My only big worry was Paul Hemsi . The kid I had done the most for and whose father had promised to make me happy for the rest of my life . After I had taken care of Paul , I had never heard from Mr. Hemsi again . Not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score from that one , at least a couple of grand , but those initial cartons of clothing had been it , the whole thing . And I had n't pushed it or asked for anything . After all , those cartons of clothes were worth thousands . They would n't " make me happy for the rest of my life , " but what the hell , I did n't mind being conned . But when the FBI began its investigation , it got onto the gossip that Paul Hemsi had beaten the draft and been enlisted in the Reserves even after he got an induction notice . I knew that the letter from the draft board rescinding his induction notice had been pulled from our files and sent to higher headquarters . I had to assume that the FBI men had talked to the draft board clerk and that he had told them the story I had given him . Which would still have been OK . Nothing really illegal , a little administrative hocuspocusthat happened every day . But the word was out that Paul I lcrosi had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I received a bribe from other friends of his . I left the house and drove by my son 's school . It had a huge playground with a basketball court of cement , the whole area fenced by high wire-mesh fences . And as I drove by , I could see that the graduation exercises were being held outside in the courtyard . I parked my car and stood outside the fence , clinging to the wire . Young boys and girls barely in their teens , they stood in orderly rows , all neatly dressed for the ceremony , their hair combed , theirp224faces scrubbed clean , waiting with childish pride for their ceremonialpassing into the next step toward adulthood . Stands had been erected for the parents . And a huge wooden platform for the dignitaries , the principal of the school , a precinct politician , an old grizzled guy wearing the blue braided overseas cap and 1920's-looking uniform of the American Legion . An Americanflag flew over the platform . I heard the principal saying something about not having enough time to give out the diplomas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the members of that class should turn and face the stands . And so I watched them for a few minutes . After each announcementa row of the young boys and girls swung around to face the stand of mothers and fathers and other relatives to receive their applause . The faces were filled with pride and pleasure and anticipation . They were heroes this day . They had been praised by the dignitaries and applauded now by their elders . Some of the poor bastards still could n't read . None of them had been prepared for the world or the trouble they would see . I was glad I could n't see my son 's face . I went back to the car and drove to New York and my meeting with the grand jury . Near the federal courthouse building I put my car in the parking lot and went into the huge marble-floored hallways . I took an elevator to the grand jury room and stepped out of the elevator . And I was shocked to see benches filled with the young men who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred of them . Some nodded to me and a few shook my hand and we made jokes about the whole business . I saw Frank Alcore standing by himself near one of the huge windows . I went over to him and shook his hand . He seemed calm . But his face was strained . " Is n't this a lot of shit ? " he said as we shook hands . " Yeah , " I said . Nobody was in uniform except Frank . He wore all his WW II campaign ribbons and his master sergeant stripes and longevity hash marks . He looked like a gung-ho career soldier . I knew he was gambling that a grand jury would refuse to indict a patriot called back to the defense of his country . I hoped it would work . " Jesus , " Frank said . " They flew about two hundred of us upp225from Fort Lee . All over a bunch of crap . Just because some of these little pricks could n't take their medicine when they got recalled . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing we had done . Just taking some money for doing a harmless little hocus-pocus . It had n't even seemed crooked . Just an accommodation , a meeting in terms of interest between two different parties beneficial to both and harmful to no one . Sure , we had broken a few laws , but we had n't done anything really bad . And here the government was spending thousands of dollars to put us in jail . It did n't seem fair . We had n't shot anybody , we had n't stuck up a bank , we had n't embezzled funds or forged checks or received stolen goods or committed rape or even been spies for the Russians . What the hell was all the fuss about ? I laughed . For some reason I was suddenly in really good spirits . " What the hell are you laughing about ? " Frank said . " This is serious . " There were people scattered all around us , some within earshot . I said to Frank cheerfully , " What the hell do we have to worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all a bunch of bullshit . Fuck them all . " He grinned back at me , catching on . " Yeah , " he said . " But still , I 'd like to kill a few of these little pricks . " " Do n't even say that kidding . " I gave him a warning look . They might have this hall bugged . " You know you do n't mean it . " " Yeah , I guess so , " Frank said reluctantly . " You 'd think these guys would be proud to serve their country . I did n't squawk , and I 've been through one war . " Then we heard Frank 's name being called out by one of the bailiffs near the two huge doors with the big black and white sign on them that read " Grand Jury Room . " As Frank went in , I saw Paul Hemsi coming out . I went up to him and said , " Hi Paul , how you doing ? " I held out my hand and he shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How 's your father ? " I said . " He 's OK , " Paul said . He hesitated briefly . " I know I 'm not supposed to talk about my testimony . You know I ca n't do that . But my father said to tell you not to worry about anything . "  |p226I  felt a wild surge of relief . He had been my one real worry . But Cully had said he would fix the Hemsi family , and now it seemed to be done . I did n't know how Cully had managed it and I did n't care . I watched Paul go to the bank of elevators , and then another one of my customers , a young kid who was an apprentice theater director I had enlisted at no charge , came up to me . He was really concerned about me , and he told me that he and his friends would testify that I had never asked for or received money from them . I thanked him and shook hands . I made some jokes and smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was playing the role of the jolly slick bribe taker thereby projecting his all-American innocence . I realizedwith some surprise that I was enjoying the whole thing . In fact , I was holding court with a lot of my customers , who were all telling me what a bunch of shit the whole business was , caused by a few soreheads . I even felt that Frank might beat the rap . Then I saw Frank come out of the grand jury room and heard my name called . Frank looked a little grim but mad , and I could tell he had n't cracked , that he was going to fight it out . I went through the two huge doors and into the grand jury room . By the time I went through the doors I had wiped the smile off my face . It was nothing like the movies . The grand jury seemed to be a mass of people sitting in rows of folding chairs . Not in a jury box or anything . The district attorney stood by a desk with sheafs of paper he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tiny desk with his machine on it . I was directed to sit on a chair that was on a little raised platform so that the jury could see me clearly . It was almost as if I were the ladderman in a baccarat pit . The district attorney was a young guy dressed in a very conservativeblack suit with a white shirt and neatly knotted sky blue tie . He had thick black hair and very pale skin . I did n't know his name , and never knew it . His voice was very calm and very detached as he asked me questions . He was just putting informationinto the record , not trying to impress the jury . He did n't even come near me when he asked his questions , just stood by his desk . He established my identity and my job . " Mr. Merlyn , " he said , " did you ever solicit money from any one for any reason whatsoever ? " " No , " I said . I looked at him and the jury members right in thep227eye as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though for some reason I wanted to smile . I was still high . The district attorney said , " Did you receive any money from anyone in order for him to be enlisted in the six months ' Army Reserve program ? " " No , " I said . " Do you have any knowledge of any other person 's receiving money contrary to law in order to receive preferred treatment in any way ? " " No , " I said , still looking at him and the mass of people sitting so uncomfortably on their small folding chairs . The room was an interior room and dark with bad lighting . I could n't really make out their faces . " Do you have any knowledge of any superior officer or anyone else at all using special influence to get someone into the six months ' program when his name was not on the waiting lists kept by your office ? " I knew he would ask a question like that . And I had thought about whether I should mention the congressman who had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major toe the line . Or tell how the Reserve colonel and some of the other Reserve officers had put their own friends ' sons on the list out of turn . Maybe that would scare off the investigators or divert attention to those higher-ups . But then I realized that the reason the FBI was taking all this trouble was to uncover higher-ups , and if that happened , the investigation would be intensified . Also , the whole affair would acquire more importance to the newspapers if a congressman were involved . So I had decided to keep my mouth shut . If I were indicted and tried , my lawyer could always use that information . So now I shook my head and said , " No . " The district attorney shuffled his papers and then said , without looking at me , " That will be all . You 're excused . " I got out of my chair and stepped down and left the jury room . And then I realized why I was so cheerful , so high , almost delighted . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when everybody was sailing along , taking bribes without a worry in the world , I had peered into the future and foreseen this day . These questions , this courthouse , the FBI , the specter of prison . And I had cast spellsp228against them . I had hidden my money with Cully . I had taken great pains not to make enemies among all the people I had done illegal business with . I had never explicitly asked for any definite sum of money . And when some of my customers had stiffed me , I had never chased them . Even Mr. Hemsi after promising to make me happy for the rest of my life . Well , he had made me happy just by getting his son not to testify .. Maybe that 's what had turned the trick , not Cully . Except that I knew better . It was Cully who had got me off the hook . But OK , even if I had needed a little help , I was still a magician . Everything had happened exactly as I knew it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't care that maybe I was just a slick hustler who took intelligent precautions.  |p229WHEN  Cully got off the plane , he took a taxi to a famous bank in Manhattan . He looked at his watch . It was after 10 A.M. Gronevelt would be making his call right now to the vice-president of the hank that Cully was delivering the money to . Everything was as planned . Cully was ushered into the vicepresident'soffice , and behind closed , locked doors , he delivered the briefcase . The vice-president opened it with his key and counted out the million dollars in front of Cully . Then he filled out a bank deposit slip , scribbled his signature on it and gave the slip of paper to ( ' ully . They shook hands and Cully left . A block away from the hank he took a prepared , stamped envelope out of his jacket pocket and put the slip into it and sealed the envelope . Then he dropped it into a mailbox on the corner . He wondered how the whole thing worked , how the vice-president covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have to know . Cully and Merlyn met in the Oak Room of the Plaza . They did n't talk about the problem until they had finished lunch and then walked through Central Park . Merlyn told Cully the whole story , and Cully nodded his head and made some sympathetic remarks . From what he could gather it was strictly a small-time grifter 's operation that the FBI had stumbled onto . Even if Merlynp230were convicted , he would get only a suspended sentence . There was n't that much to worry about . Except that Merlyn was such a square guy he 'd be ashamed of having a conviction on his record . That should be the worst of his worries , Cully thought . When Merlyn mentioned Paul Hemsi , the name rang a bell in Cully 's head . But now , as they walked through Central Park and Merlyn told him about the meeting with Hemsi Senior in the garment center , everything clicked . One of the many garment center tycoons who came to Vegas for long weekends and the Christmas and New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a devoted cunt man . Even when he came to Vegas with his wife , Cully had to arrange for Charlie Hemsi to get a piece . Right on the floor of the casino with the Mrs. Hemsi playing roulette , Cully would slip the key , its room-numbered wooden plaque attached , into Charlie Hemsi 's hand . Cully would whisper what time the girl would be in the room . Charlie Hemsi would wander out to the coffee shop to escape his wife 's suspicious eye . From the coffee shop he would saunter down the long labyrinth of hotel corridors to the room numbered on the key plaque . Inside that room he would find a luscious girl waiting for him . It would take less than a half hour . Charlie would give the girl a black hundred-dollar chip , then , thoroughly relaxed , saunter down the blue-carpeted corridors into the casino . He would pass by the roulette table and watch his wife gamble , give her a few encouraging words , some chips , never the blacks , then plunge joyfully back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluff , good-natured guy , a lousy gambler who nearly always lost , a degenerate gambler who never quit when he was ahead . Cully had not remembered him immediately because Charlie Hemsi had been trying to take the cure . Hemsi had markers out all over Vegas . The Xanadu casino cage alone held fifty grand of Charlie Hemsi 's IOU 's . Some of the casinos had already sent dunning letters . Gronevelt had told Cully to hold off . " He may bail himself out , " Gronevelt said . " Then he 'll remember we were nice guys and we 'll get most of his action . Money in the bank when that asshole gambles . " Cully doubted it . " That asshole owes over three hundred grand around town , " he said . " Nobody has seen him in a year . I think he 's going the claim agent route . "  | " Maybe , " Gronevelt said . " He 's got a good business in New York . If he has a big year , he 'll be back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Listen , he 's sitting with his wife and kids , going to neighborhood parties . Maybe he hits the hookers in the garment center . But that makes him nervous , too many of his friends know . Here in Vegas it 's all so clean . And he 's a crapshooter . They do n't leave the table so easy . " " And if his business does n't have a big year ? " Cully asked . " Then he 'll use his Hitler money , " Gronevelt said . He took note of Cully 's politely inquiring and amused face . " That 's what the garment center boys call it . During the war they all made a fortune in black-market deals . When materials were rationed by the government , a lot of money passed beneath the table . Money they did n't have to report to Internal Revenue . Could n't report . They all got rich . But it 's money they ca n't let show . If you want to get rich in this country , you have to get rich in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered . " You have to get rich in the dark . " The credo of Vegas , not only of Vegas , but of many of the businessmen who came to Vegas . Men who owned supermarkets , cash vending businesses , heads of construction firms , shady church officials of all denominations who collected cash in holy baskets . Big corporations with platoons of legal advisers who created a plain of darkness within the law . Cully listened to Merlyn with only half an ear . Thank God Merlyn never talked much . It was soon over , and as they walked through the park in silence , Cully sorted everything out in his head . Just to make sure , he asked Merlyn to describe Hemsi Senior again . No , it was n't Charlie . It must be one of his brothers , a partner in the business and , from the sound of it , the dominant partner . Charlie had never struck Cully as a hardworking executive . Counting down in his head , Cully could see all the steps he would have to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would approve . He had only three days before Merlyn appeared before the grand jury , but that would be enough . So now Cully could enjoy the walk through the park with Merlyn . They talked about old times . They asked the same old questions about Jordan . Why had he done it ? Why would a man who had just won four hundred grand blow his brains out ? Both ofp232them were too young to dream of the emptiness of success , though Merlyn had read about it in novels and textbooks . Cully did n't buy that bullshit . He knew how happy " The Pencil , " the complete one , would make him . He would be an emperor . Rich and powerful men , beautiful women would be his guests . He could fly them from the ends of the world free , the Xanadu Hotel would pay . Just by his , Cully 's , use of " The Pencil . " He could bestow luxurious suites , the richest foods , fine wines , beautiful women one at a time , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really beautiful . He could transport the ordinary mortal into paradise for three , four , five days , even a week . All free . Except , of course , that they had to buy chips , the greens and blacks , and they had to gamble . A small price to pay . They could win , after all , if they got lucky . If they gambled intelligently , they would not lose too much . Cully thought benevolently that he would use " The Pencil " for Merlyn . Merlyn could have anything he wanted whenever he came to Vegas . And now Merlyn was crooked . Or at least bent . Yet it was plain to Cully that it was a temporary aberration . Everybody gets bent at least one time in his life . And Merlyn showed his shame , at least to Cully . He had lost some of his serenity , some of his confidence . And this touched Cully . He had never been innocent and he treasured innocence in others . So when he and Merlyn said their good-byes , Cully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll fix it . Go into that grand jury room and deny everything . OK ? " Merlyn laughed . " What else can I do ? " he said . " And when you come out to Vegas , everything is on the house , " Cully said . " You 're my guest . " " I do n't have my lucky Winner jacket , " Merlyn said , smiling . " Do n't worry , " Cully said . " If you sink too deep , I 'll deal you a little blackjack personally . " " That 's stealing , not gambling , " Merlyn said . " I gave up stealing ever since I got that notice to the grand jury . " " I was only kidding , " Cully said . " I would n't do that to Gronevelt . If you were maybe a beautiful broad , yes , but you 're too ugly . " And he was surprised to see Merlyn flinch again . And it struck him that Merlyn was one of those people who thought of themselves as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not men , he thought . Cully saidp233his final good-bye by asking Merlyn if he needed some of his black cash stashed at the hotel , and Merlyn said not yet . And so they parted . Back in his Plaza Hotel suite Cully made a series of calls to the casinos in Vegas . Yes , Charles Hemsi 's markers were still outstanding . He made a call to Gronevelt to outline his plan and then changed his mind . Nobody in Vegas knew how many taps the FBI had around town . So he just mentioned casually to Gronevelt that he would stay in New York for a few days and ask for some markers from New York customers who were behind , a little late . Gronevelt was laconic . " Ask them nice , " he said . And Cully said of course , what else could he do ? They both understood they were talking for the FBI record . But Gronevelt had been alerted and would expect an explanation later in Vegas . Cully would be in the clear , he had not tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got in touch with Charles Hemsi , not at the garment center office , but on a golf course in Roslyn , Long Island . Cully rented a limo and got out there early . He had a drink at the clubhouse and waited . It was two hours before he saw Charles Hemsi come off the links . Cully got up from his chair and strolled outside , where ( ' harles was chatting with his partners before going into the lockers . He saw Hemsi hand over some money to one of the players ; the sucker had just been hustled in golf , he lost everywhere . Cully sauntered up to them casually . " Charlie , " he said with sincere Vegas " Host " pleasure . " Good to see you again . " He held out his hand and Hemsi shook it . Ile could see that funny look on Hemsi 's face which meant he recognized Cully but could n't place him . Cully said , " From the Xanadu Hotel . Cully . Cully Cross . " I lemsi 's face changed again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cully gave his most charming smile , and slappingHemsi on the back , he said , " We 've missed you . Have n't seen you in a long time . Jesus , what are the odds of me running into Doti like this ? Like betting a number on the roulette wheel straightup . The golf partners were drifting into the clubhouse , and Charliep234started to follow them . He was a big man , much bigger than Cully , and he just brushed past . Cully allowed it . Then he called after Hemsi , " Charlie , give me a minute . I 'm here to help . " He made his voice fill with sincerity , without pleading . And yet the notes of his words were strong , rang like iron . The other man hesitated and Cully was quickly at his side . " Charlie , listen , this will not cost you a dime . I can square all your markers in Vegas . And you do n't pay a cent . All your brother has to do is a small favor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he shook his head . " I do n't want my brother to know about those markers . He 's murder . No way you can tell my brother . " Cully said softly , almost sorrowfully , " The casinos are tired of waiting , Charlie . The collectors are going to be in the picture . You know how they operate . They go down to your place of business , make scenes . They scream for their money . When you see two seven-foot three-hundred-pound guys screaming for their money , it can be a little unnerving . " " They ca n't scare my brother , " Charlie Hemsi said . " He 's tough and he has connections . " " Sure , " Cully said . " I do n't mean they can make you pay if you do n't want to . But your brother will know and he 'll get involved and the whole thing will be messy . Look , I 'll make you a promise . Get your brother to see me and I 'll put a hold on all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and gamble , and I 'll comp you all the way just like before . You wo n't be able to sign markers , you 'll have to play cash . If you win , you can make a little payment on the markers as you go along . That 's a good deal . No ? " Here Cully made a little gesture almost of apology . He could see Charlie 's light blue eyes get interested . The guy had n't been to Vegas for a year . He must be missing the action . Cully recalled that in Vegas he had never asked to be comped for the golf course . Which meant that he was n't that crazy about golf . Because a lot of degenerate gamblers liked to put in a morning on the great golf course of the Xanadu Hotel . This guy was bored stiff . Still , Charlie hesitated . " Your brother is going to know anyway , " Cully said . " Better from me than the collectors . You know me . You know I 'll never go over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor ? " Charlie asked . " Small , small , " Cully said . " He 'll do it once he hears the proposition . I swear to you . He wo n't mind . He 'll be glad to do it . " Charlie smiled a sad smile . " He wo n't be glad , " he said . " But come on into the clubhouse and we 'll have a drink and talk . " An hour later Cully was on his way back to New York . He had stood over Charlie when Charlie made the phone call to his brother and arranged the appointment . He had conned and hustled and charmed Charlie Hemsi a dozen different ways . That he would square all the markers in Vegas , that nobody would ever bother him for the money . That the next time Charlie came to Vegas he would have the best suite and be comped all the way . And also as a bonus , that there was a girl , tall , long-legged , blond , from England with that great English accent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best-looking dancer in the line at the Xanadu Hotel cabaret show . And Charlie could have her all night . Charlie would love her . And she would love Charlie . So they had made arrangements for Charlie 's trip at the end of the month . By the time Cully got through with him Charlie thought he was eating honey rather than getting castor oil poured down his throat . Cully went back to the Plaza first to wash up and change . He got rid of the limousine . He would walk down to the garment center . In his room he put on his best Sy Devore suit , silk shirt and conservative brown plaid tie . He put cuff links into his shirt sleeves . Ile had a pretty good picture of Eli Hemsi from brother Charles , and he did n't want to make a bad first impression . Walking through the garment center , Cully felt disgust at the dirtiness of the city and the pinched , haggard faces walking its streets . Hand trucks , loaded with brightly colored dresses gallowed from metal racks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seamed red faces of alcoholics . They pushed the hand trucks through the streets like cowboys , stopping traffic , almost knocking down pedestrians . Like sand and tumbleweed of a desert , the garbage of discarded newspapers , remnants of food , empty pop bottles caught in the truck wheels , washed over their shoes and trouser cuffs . The sidewalks were so clogged with people you could hardly breathe , even in the open air . The buildings looked can/cerous , gray tumors rising to the sky . Cully regretted for a moment his affection for Merlyn . He hated this city . He was amazed that anyone chose to live in it . And people made cracks about Vegas . And gambling . Shit . At least gambling kept the city clean . The entranceway of the Hemsi building seemed neater than others ; the skin of the foyer that held the elevator seemed to have , a thinner coat of grime over the usual white tiles . Jesus , Cully thought , what a crummy business . But when he got off on the sixth floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and secretary were not up to Vegas standards , but Eli Hemsi 's suite of offices was . And Eli Hemsi , Cully saw at a glance , was a man not to be fucked around with in any way . Eli Hemsi was dressed in his usual dark silk suit with a pearly gray tie sitting on his startlingly white shirt . His massive head bowed in alert attention as Cully spoke . His deep-socketed eyes seemed sad . But his energy and force could not be contained . Poor Merlyn , Cully thought , getting mixed up with this guy . Cully was as brief as could be under the circumstances , gravely businesslike . Charm would be wasted on Eli Hemsi . " I 've come here to help two people , " Cully said . " Your brother , Charles , and a friend of mine named Merlyn . Believe me when I tell you that is my sole purpose . For me to help them you have to do a small favor . If you say no , there is nothing more I can do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do nothing to hurt anyone . Everything will remain the same . " He paused for a moment to let Eli Hemsi say something , but that great buffalolike head was frozen with wary attention . The somber eyes did not even flicker . Cully went on . " Your brother , Charles , owes my hotel in Vegas , the Xanadu , over fifty thousand dollars . He owes another two hundred and fifty thousand scattered around Vegas . Let me say right now that my hotel will never press him for his markers . He 's been too good a customer and he 's too nice a man . The other casinos may make things a little unpleasant for him , but they ca n't really make him pay if you use your connections , which I know you have . But then you owe your connections a favor which eventually may cost you more than what I ask . " Eli Hemsi sighed and then asked in his soft but powerful voice , " Is my brother a good gambler ? "  | " Not really , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any difference . Everybody loses . " Hemsi sighed again . " He 's not much better in the business . I am going to buy him out , get rid of him , fire my own brother . He 's nothing but trouble with his gambling and his women . When he was young , he was a great salesman , the best , but he 's too old now and he 's not interested . I do n't know if I can help him . I know I wo n't pay his gambling debts . I do n't gamble , I do n't take that pleasure . Why should I pay for his ? " " I 'm not asking you to , " Cully said . " But here 's what I can do . My hotel will buy all his markers from the other casinos . He wo n't have to pay for them unless he comes and gambles and wins at our casino . We wo n't give him any more credit , and I 'll make sure no other casino in Vegas gives him credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cash . That 's strength . For him . Just like letting people sign markers is our strength in our operation . I can give him that protection . " Hemsi was still watching him very intently . " But my brother keeps gambling ? " " You 'll never be able to stop him , " Cully said simply . " There are many men like him , very few men like yourself . Real life is not that exciting to him anymore , he 's not interested . Very common . " Eli Hemsi nodded , thinking that over , rolling it around his buffalolike head . " But this is n't too bad a business deal for you , " he said to Cully . " Nobody can collect my brother 's debts , you said that yourself , so you 're giving away nothing . And then my foolish brother comes with ten , twenty thousand dollars in his pocket and you win it from him . So you gain . No ? " Cully said very carefully , " It could go another way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal more money . Enough money to make certain people think it worthwhile to collect them or try harder to collect them . Who knows how foolish a man can get ? Believe me when I tell you that your brother wo n't be able to stay away from Vegas . It 's in his blood . Men like him come from all over the world . Three , four , five times a year . I do n't know why , but they come . It means something to them that you and I ca n't understand . And remember , I have to buy up his markers ; that will cost me something . " As he said this , he won/dered how he could make Gronevelt accept the proposition . But he would worry about that later . " And what is the favor ? " The question was finally asked in that same soft , yet powerful voice . It was really the voice of a saint , the voice seemed to give off a spiritual serenity . Cully was impressed and for the first time a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Your son , Paul . He gave testimony against my friend Merlyn . You remember Merlyn . You promised to make him happy for the rest of his life . " And Cully let the steel come into his voice . He was annoyed by the power given off by this man . A power born of his tremendous success with money , the rise from poverty to millions in an adverse world , from the victorious wars of his life while carrying a foolish brother . But Eli Hemsi did not rise to the bait of this ironic reproach . He did not even smile . He was still listening . " Your son 's testimony is the only evidence against Merlyn . Sure I understand , Paul was frightened . " Suddenly there was a dangerousflicker in those dark eyes watching him . Anger at this stranger knowing his son 's first name and using it so familiarly and almost contemptuously . Cully gave back a sweet smile . " A very nice boy you have , Mr. Hemsi . Everybody is certain he was tricked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've consulted some very good lawyers . They say he can back off in the grand jury room , give his testimony in such a way so that he will not convince the jury and still not get in trouble with the FBI . Maybe he can retract the testimony altogether . " He studied the face opposite him . There was nothing to read . " I assume your son has immunity , " Cully said . " He wo n't be prosecuted . I also understand you probably have it arranged so he wo n't have to do his Army duty . He 'll come out of it a hundred percent OK . I figure you have that all set . But if he does this favor , I promise you nothing will change . " Eli Hemsi spoke now in a different voice . It was stronger , not so soft , yet persuasive , a salesman selling . " I wish I could do that , " he said . " That boy , Merlyn , he 's a very nice boy . He helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cully noted that here was a man who used the word " forever " pretty often . No halfway gestures for him . He had promised Merlyn he would make him happy for the rest ofp239his life . Now he was going to be grateful forever . A real fucking claim agent weaseling out of his obligations . For the second time Cully felt some anger that this guy was treating Merlyn like such a schmuck . But he continued to listen with an agreeable smile on his face . " There is nothing I can do , " Hemsi said . " I ca n't endanger my son . My wife would never forgive me . He is her whole life to her . My brother is a grown man . Who can help him ? Who can guide him , who can make his life now ? But my son has to be cared for . lle is my first concern . Afterward , believe me , I will do anything for Mr. Merlyn . Ten , twenty , thirty years from now I will never forget him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ask me anything . " Mr. Hemsi rose from his desk and put out his hand , his powerful frame bent over with grateful solicitousness . " I wish my son had a friend like you . " Cully grinned at him , shook his hand . " I do n't know your son , but your brother is my friend . He 's coming out to visit me in Vegas at the end of the month . But do n't worry , I 'll take care of him . I 'll keep him out of trouble . " He saw the pondering look on Eli Ilemsi 's face . He might as well sock it to him all the way . " Since you ca n't help me , " Cully said , " I have to get Merlyn a really good lawyer . Now the district attorney has probably told you that Merlyn will plead guilty and get a suspended sentence . And everything will blow away so that your son not only will get immunity but will never have to go back into the Army . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There will be a trial . Your son will have to appear in an open court . Your son will have to testify . ' I here will be a lot of publicity . I know that wo n't bother you , but the newspapers will get to know where your son , Paul , is and what he is doing . I do n't care who promised you what . Your son will have to go into the Army . The newspapers will just put on too much pressure . And then , besides all that , you and your son will have enemies . To use your phrase , I ' 11 make you unhappy for the rest of your life . ' " Now that the threat was out in the open Hemsi leaned back in the chair and stared at Cully . His face , heavy and cragged , was more sad in its somberness than angry . So Cully gave it to him again . " You have connections . Call them and listen to their advice.  |p240Ask  about me . Tell them I work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and call Gronevelt , there is nothing I can do . But you 'll be in their debt . " Hemsi leaned back in his chair . " You say everything will come out right if my son does what you ask ? " " I guarantee it , " Cully said . " He wo n't have to go back into the Army ? " Hemsi asked again . " I guarantee that too , " Cully said . " I have friends in Washington , as you have . But my friends can do things your friendsca n't do , even if only because they ca n't be connected to you . " Eli Hemsi was ushering Cully to the door . " Thank you , " he said . " Thank you very much . I have to think over everything you said . I 'll be in touch with you . " They shook hands again as he walked Cully to the door of his suite . " I 'm at the Plaza , " Cully said . " And I 'm leaving for Vegas tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd be grateful . " But it was Charlie Hemsi who called him . Charlie was drunk and gleeful . " Cully , you smart little bastard . I do n't know how you did it , but my brother told me to tell you that everything is OK . He agrees with you completely . " Cully relaxed . Eli Hemsi had made his phone calls to check him out . And Gronevelt must have backed the play . He felt an enormousaffection and gratitude for Gronevelt . He said to Charlie , " That 's great . See you in Vegas at the end of the month . You 'll have the time of your life . " " I would n't miss it , " Charlie Hemsi said . " And do n't forget that dancer . " " I wo n't , " Cully said . After that he dressed and went out for dinner . In the restaurant lobby he used the pay phone to call Merlyn . " Everything is OK , it was all a misunderstanding . You 're going to be all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstracted and not as grateful as Cully would have liked it to be . " Thanks , " Merlyn said . " See you in Vegas soon . " And he hung up.  |p241CULLY  Cross squared everything for me , but poor patriotic Frank Alcore was indicted , released from active duty to civilian status , tried and convicted . A year in prison . A week later the major called me into his office . He was n't mad at me or indignant ; in fact , he had an amused smile on his face . " I do n't know how you did it , Merlyn , " he told me . " But you beat the rap . Congratulations . And I do n't give a shit , the whole business is a fucking joke . They should have put those kids in jail . I 'm glad for you , but I 've got my orders to handle this business and make sure it does n't happen , again . Now I 'm talking to you as a friend . I 'm not pressing . My advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was shocked and a little sick . I thought I was home free and here I was out of a job . How the hell would I meet all my bills ? How would I support my wife and kids ? How would I pay the mortgage on the new house on Long Island I would be moving into in just a few months ? I tried to keep a poker face when I said , " The grand jury cleared me . Why do I have to quit ? " The major must have read me . I remember Jordan and Cully in Las Vegas kidding me about how anybody could tell what I was thinking . Because the major had a look of pity when he said , " I'mp242telling you for your own good . The brass will have their CID people all over this armory . The FBI may keep snooping around . All the kids in the Reserve will still try to use you , try to get you into deals . They 'll keep the pot stirring . But if you quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cool off and go away with nothing to focus on . " I wanted to ask about all the other civilians who had been taking bribes , but the major anticipated me . " I know of at least ten other advisers like you , unit administrators , who are going to resign . Some have already . Believe me , I 'm on your side . And you 'll be OK . You 're wasting your time on this job . You should have done better for yourself at your age . " I nodded . I was thinking that too . That I had n't done much with my life so far . Sure , I 'd had a novel published , but I was making a hundred bucks a week take-home pay from Civil Service . True , I earned another three or four hundred a month with free-lance articles for the magazines , but with the illegal gold mine closed down , I had to make a move . " OK , " I said . " I 'll write a letter giving two weeks ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You have some paid sick leave coming , " he said . " Use it up in those two weeks and look for a new job . I 'll stand still for it . Just come in a couple of times a week to keep the paperwork going . " I went back to my desk and wrote out my letter of resignation . Things were n't as bad as they looked . I had about twenty days of vacation pay coming to me , which was about four hundred dollars . I had , I figured , about fifteen hundred dollars in my government pension fund , which I could draw out , though I 'd forfeit my rights to a pension when I was sixty-five . But that was more than thirty years away . I could be dead by then . A total of two grand . And then there was the bribe money I had stashed with Cully in Vegas . Over thirty grand there . For a moment I had an overwhelming sense of panic . What if Cully reneged on me and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could do about that . We were good friends , he had bailed me out of my troubles , but I had no illusions about Cully . He was a Vegas hustler . What if he said he had my money coming to him for the favor he had done me ? I could n't dispute it . I would have paid the money to keep out of jail . Christ , would I have paid it !  |p243But  the thing I dreaded most was having to tell Valerie I was out of a job . And having to explain to her father . The old man would ask around and get the truth anyway . I did n't tell Valerie that night . The next day I took off from work and went to see Eddie Lancer at his magazines . I told him everything and he sat there , shaking his head and laughing . When I finished , he said , almost wonderingly , " You know , I 'm always getting surprised . I thought you were the straightest guy in the world next to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how taking the bribes , becoming a half-assed criminal had made me feel better psychologically . That in some way I had discharged a lot of the bitterness I felt . The rejection of my novel by the public , the drabness of my life , its basic failure , how I 'd always really been unhappy . Lancer was looking at me with that little smile on his face . " And I thought you were the least neurotic guy I ever met , " he said . " You 're happily married , you have kids , you live a secure life , you earn a living . You 're working on another novel . What the hell more do you want ? " " I 'll need a job , " I told him . Eddie Lancer thought that one over for a moment . Oddly enough I did n't feel embarrassed appealing to him . " Just between you and me I 'm leaving this place in about six months , " he said . " They 'll move another editor up to my place . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a favor . I 'll ask him to give you enough free-lance to live on . " " That would be great , " I said . Eddie said briskly , " I can load you up with work until then . " Adventure stories , some of the love fiction crap and some book reviews I usually do . OK ? " " Sure , " I said . " When do you figure you 'll finish your book ? " " In a couple of months , " Lancer said . " How about you ? " It was a question I always hated . The truth was that I had only an outline of a novel I wanted to write about a famous criminal case in Arizona . But I had n't written anything . I had submitted the outline to my publisher , but he had refused to give me an advance . He e said it was the kind of novel that would n't make money because it involved the kidnapping of a child who was murdered . There would n't be any sympathy for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at another Crime and Punishment , and that had scared the publisher off . " I 'm working on it , " I said . " Still a long way to go . " Lancer smiled sympathetically . " You 're a good writer , " he said . " You 'll make it big someday . Do n't worry . " We talked awhile longer about writing and books . We both agreed we were better novelists than most of the famous novelists making their fortunes on the best-seller lists . When I left , I was in a confident mood . I always left Lancer that way . For some reason he was one of the few people I felt easy with , and because I knew he was smart and gifted , his good opinion of my talent cheered me up . And so everything had turned out for the best . I was now a fulltimewriter , I would lead an honest life , I had escaped jail and in a few months I would move into my very own house , for the first time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two months later I moved into my newly built house on Long Island . The kids all had their own bedrooms . We had three bathroomsand a special laundry room . I would no longer have to lie in my bath while newly washed clothes dripped down into my face . No longer have to wait for the kids to finish . I had the almost excruciating luxury of privacy . My own den to write in , my own garden , my own lawn . I was separate from other people . It was Shangri-La . And yet it was something so many people took for granted . Most important of all , I felt that now my family was safe . We had left the poor and desperate behind us . They would never catch up ; their tragedies would never cause ours . My children would never be orphans . Sitting on my suburban back porch one day , I realized I was truly happy , maybe happier than I would ever be in my life again . And that made me a little pissed off . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with such ordinary pleasures , a wife I loved , children who delighted me , a cheap tract house in the suburbs ? One thing sure , I was no Gauguin . Maybe that was why I was n't writing . I was too happy . And I felt a twinge of resentment against Valerie . She had me trapped . Jesus.  |p245Exce|pt  even this could n't keep me feeling content . Everything was going so well . And the pleasure you took in children was so commonplace . They were so disgustingly " cute . " When my son was five years old , I had taken him for a walk through the streets of the city and a cat had jumped out of a cellar and almost literally sailed in front of us . My son had turned to me and said , " Is that a scaredy-cat ? " When I told Vallie about it , she was delighted and wanted to send it in to one of those magazines that pay money for cute little stories . I 'd had a different reaction . I wondered if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scaredy-cat and he had been puzzled by what the phrase meant rather than insulted . I thought of all the mysteries of language and experience my son was encountering for the first time . And I envied him the innocence of childhood as I envied him the luck he had in having parents he could say that to and then have them make a fuss over him . And I remembered one day when we had gone out for a family Sunday-afternoon walk on Fifth Avenue , Valerie window-shopping for dresses she could never afford . Coming toward us was a woman about three feet tall but dressed elegantly in suede jerkin and white frilly blouse and dark tweed skirt . My daughter tugged at Valerie 's coat and pointed to the dwarf lady and said , " Mommy , what 's that ? " Valerie was horrified with embarrassment . She was always terrifiedabout hurting anyone 's feelings . She shushed my daughter until the woman was safely past . Then she explained to our daughter that the woman was one of those people who had never grown taller . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked , " You mean she did n't grow up . You mean she 's an old lady like you ? " Valerie smiled at me . " Yes , dear , " she said . " Now do n't think about it anymore . It only happens to very few people . " At home that night , when I told my kids a story before sending them to bed , my daughter seemed to be lost in thought and not listening . I asked her what was wrong . Then , her eyes very wide , she said , " Daddy , am I really a little girl or am I just an old lady who did n't grow up ? " I knew that there were millions of people who had stories like this to tell about their kids . That it was all terribly commonplace.  |p246And  yet I could n't help the feeling that sharing a part of my children 's lives made me richer . That the fabric of my life was made up of these little things that seemed to have no importance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infuriated Valerie by continuingly misbehaving . She threw food at her brother , deliberately spilled a drink and then knocked over a gravy boat . Finally Valerie screamed at her , " You do one more thing and I 'll kill you . " It was , of course , a figure of speech . But my daughter stared at her very intently and asked , " Do you have a gun ? " It was funny because she so obviously believed that her mother could n't kill her unless she had a gun . She knew nothing yet of wars and pestilence , of rapists and molesters , of automobile accidentsand plane crashes , clubbings , cancer , poison , getting thrown out of a window . Valerie and I both laughed , and Valerie said , " Of course , I have n't got a gun , do n't be silly . " And the knot of worried concentration disappeared from my daughter 's face . I noticed that Valerie never made that kind of irritated remark again . And Valerie astonished me too sometimes . She had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was no longer the bohemian Greenwich Village girl who had wanted to become a writer . In the city housing project pets had been forbidden , and Vallie never told me she loved animals . Now that we owned a house Valerie bought a puppy and a kitten . Which did n't make me too happy , even though my son and daughter made a pretty picture playing with their pets on the lawn . The truth is that I had never liked house dogs and cats ; they were caricatures of orphans . I was too happy with Valerie . I had no idea then how rare this was and how valuable . And she was the perfect mother for a writer . When the kids fell and had to get stitched up , she never panicked or bothered me . She did n't mind doing all the work a man usually does around the house and which I had no patience for . Her parents now lived only thirty minutes away , and often in the evenings and on weekends she took the car and the kids and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . She knew I hated that kind of visit and that I could use time alone to work on my book.  |p247But  for some reason she had nightmares , maybe because of her Catholic upbringing . During the night I would have to wake her up because she gave little cries of despair and wept even while sound asleep . One night she was terribly frightened and I held her close in my arms and asked her what was wrong , what she 'd dreamed about and she whispered to me , " Never tell me that I 'm dying . " Which scared the hell out of me . I had visions of her having gone to the doctor and receiving bad news . But the next morning , when I questioned her about it , she did n't remember anything . And when I asked her if she had been to see the doctor , she laughed at me . She said . " It 's my religious upbringing . I guess I just worry about going to hell . " For two years I wrote free-lance articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so happily married that it almost disgusted me . Valerie did a lot of visiting with her family , and I spent a lot of time in my basement writing den , so we really did n't see that much of each other . I had at least three assignments from the magazines every month , while working on a novel I hoped would make me rich and famous . The kidnapping and murder novel was my plaything ; the magazines were my bread and butter . I figured I had another three years to go before I finished the book , but I did n't care . I read through the growing pile of manuscript whenever I became lonely . And it was lovely watching the kids grow older and Valerie happier and more content and less afraid of dying . But nothing lasts . It does n't last because you do n't want it to last , I think . If everything is perfect , you go looking for trouble . After two years of living in my suburban house , writing ten hours every day , going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I welcomed a call from Eddie Lancer asking me to have dinner with him in the city . For the first time in two years I would see New York at night . I had gone in during the day to talk over my magazine assignments with the editors , but I always drove home for dinner . Valerie had become a great cook , and I did n't want to miss the evening with my kids and my final nightcap of work in my den . But Eddie Lancer was just back from Hollywood , and he promisedme some great stories and some great food . And as usual hep248asked me how my novel was coming . He always treated me as if he knew I was going to be a great writer , and I loved that . He was one of the few people I knew who seemed to have a genuine kindness untouched by self-interest . And he could be very funny in a way I envied . He reminded me of Valerie when she had been writing stories at the New School . She had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashed out every once in a while even now . And so I told Eddie I had to go into the magazines the next day to get an assignment and we could have dinner afterward . He took me to a place called Pearl 's that I had never heard of . I was so dumb that I did n't know it was New York 's " in " Chinese restaurant . It was the first time I had ever eaten Chinese food , and when I told Eddie that , he was amazed . He did a whole routine introducing me to different Chinese dishes while pointing out the celebrities and even opening up my fortune cookie and reading it for me . He also stopped me from eating the fortune cookie . " No , no , you never eat them , " he said . " That 's terribly unsophisticated . If there 's one valuable thing you 'll get out of this night , it 's learning never to eat your fortune cookie in a Chinese restaurant . " It was a whole routine that was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each other . But months later I read a story of his in Esquire in which he used that incident . It was a touching story , making fun of himself making fun of me . I knew him better after that story , how his good humor masked his essential loneliness and estrangement from the world and the people around him . And I got a hint of what he really thought about me . He painted a picture of me as a man in control of life and knowing where he was going . Which amused the hell out of me . But he was wrong about the fortune cookie business being the only valuable thing I would get out of that night . Because after dinner he talked me into going to one of those New York literary parties , where again I met the great Osano . We were having our dessert and coffee . Eddie made me order chocolate ice cream . He told me that it was the only dessert that went with Chinese food . " Remember that , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice cream for dessert . " Then offhandedly he asked me to come to the party withp249him . I was a little reluctant . I had an hour and a half drive out to Long Island , and I was anxious to get home and maybe get in an hour 's work before I went to bed . " Come on , " Eddie said . " You ca n't always be an uxurious hermit . Make a night out of it . There 'll be some good booze , good talk and some nice-looking broads . And you might make some valuable contacts . It 's harder for a critic to knock the shit out of you if he knows you personally . And your stuff may read better to some publisher if he 's met you at a party and he thinks you 're a nice guy . " Eddie knew that I had no publisher for my new book . The publisher of my first book never wanted to see me again because it had sold only two thousand copies and never got a paperback . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let on that he remembered that interview , and neither did I. But a week later . I got a letter from him asking if I would come in to see him and have lunch about a job he had to offer me.  |p251I  took the job with Osano for many different reasons . The job was interesting and prestigious . Since Osano had been appointed the editor of the most influential literary supplement in the country a few years ago , he had trouble with people working for him and so I would be his assistant . The money was good , and the work would n't interfere with my novel . And then I was too happy at home ; I was becoming too much of a bourgeois hermit . I was happy , but my life was dull . I craved some excitement , some danger . I had vague fleeting memories of my running away to Vegas and how I had actually relished the loneliness and despair I felt then . Is that so crazy , to remember unhappiness with such delight and to despise happiness you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took the job because of Osano himself . He was , of course , the most famous writer in America . Praised for his string of successful novels , notorious for his scrapes with the law and his revolutionary attitude toward society . Infamous for his scandalous sexual misbehavior . He fought against everybody and everything . And yet at the party where Eddie Lancer had taken me to meet him he charmed and fascinated everyone . And the people at the party were the cream of the literary world and no slouches at being charming and difficult in their own right . And I have to admit Osano charmed me . At the party he gotp252into a furious argument with one of the most powerful literary critics in America , who was also a close friend and supporter of his work . But the critic had dared voice the opinion that nonfiction writers were creating art and that some critics were artists . Osano swarmed all over him . " You bloodsucking cocksucker , " he shouted , drink balanced in one hand , his other hand poised as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fucking nerve to make a living off real writers and then say you 're the artist ? You do n't even know what art is . An artist creates out of nothing but himself , do you understand that , you fucking asshole ? He 's like a fucking spider , the cobwebs are packed away in his body . And you pricks just come along and blow them away with your fucking housewife brooms after he spins them out . You 're good with a broom , you fucking jerkoff , that 's all you are . " His friend was stunned because he had just praised Osano 's nonfiction books and said they were art . And Osano walked away to a group of women who were waiting to lionize him . There were a couple of feminists in the group , and he was n't with them two minutes before his group again became the center of attention . One of the women was shouting at him furiously as he listened to her with amused contempt , his sneaky green eyes glowing like a cat 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you do n't even understand power plays , " he said . " Your hole card is your cunt , and you show it to your opponents face up . You give it away . And without your cunts you have no power at all . Men can live without affection but not without sex . Women have to have affection and can do without sex . " At this last statement the women swarmed over him with furious protests . But he stood them off . " Women are complaining about marriage when they are getting the best bargain they will ever get in their lives . Marriage is like those bonds you buy . There is inflation and there is devaluation . The value keeps going down and down for men . You know why ? Women become less and less valuable as they grow older . And then we 're stuck with them like an old car . Women do n't age as well as men . Can you imagine a fifty-year-old broad being able to con a twenty-year-old kid into bed ? And very few women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  |p253One  woman shouted , " I have a twenty-year-old lover . " She was a good-looking woman of about forty . Osano grinned at her wickedly . " I congratulate you , " he said . " But what about when you 're fifty ? With the young girls giving it away so easily you 'll have to catch them coming out of grammar school and promise them a ten-speed bike . And do you think your young lovers fall in love with you as young women do with men ? You have n't got that old Freudian father image working for you as we do . And I must repeat , a man at forty looks more attractive than he does at twenty . At fifty he can still be very attractive . It 's biological . " " Bullshit , " the attractive forty-year-old woman said . " Young girls make fools out of you old guys and you believe their bullshit . You 're not any more attractive , you just have more power . And you have all the laws on your side . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure , " Osano said . " You 'll get laws passed so that men will have to get operations to make themselves look uglier when they get older . In the name of fair play and equal rights . You may even get our balls cut off legally . That does n't change the truth now . " He paused and said , " You know the worst line of poetry ? Browning . Grow old along with me ! The best is yet to be .... ' " I just hung around and listened . What Osano was saying struck me as mostly bullshit . For one thing we had different ideas about writing . I hated literary talk , though I read all the critics and bought all the critical reviews . What the hell was being an artist ? It was not sensitivity . It was not intelligence . It was not anguish . Not ecstasy . That was all bullshit . The truth was that you were like a safecracker fiddling with the dial and listening to the tumblers click into place . And after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could start typing . And the hell of it was that what was in the safe was most times not all that valuable . It was just fucking hard work and a pain in the ass in the bargain . You could n't sleep at night . You lost all your confidence with people and the outside world . You became a coward , a malingerer in everyday living . You ducked the responsibilities ofp254your emotional life , but after all , it was the only thing you could do . And maybe that was why I was even proud of all the junk I wrote for pulp magazines and book reviews . It was a skill I had , finally a craft . I was n't just a lousy fucking artist . Osano never understood that . He had always striven to be an artist and turned out some art and near art . Just as years later he never understood the Hollywood thing , that the movie business was young , like a baby not yet toilet-trained , so you could n't blame it for shitting all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you have such a great track record with women . What 's the secret of your success ? " Everybody laughed , including Osano . I admired him even more , a guy with five ex-wives who could afford to laugh . Osano said , " I tell them it has to be a hundred percent my way and no percent their way before they move in with me . They understand my position and they accept . I always tell them that when they are no longer satisfied with the arrangement to just move out . No arguments , no explanations , no negotiations , just leave . And I ca n't understand it . They say yes when they move in , and then they break the rules . They try to get it ten percent their way . And when they do n't get it , they start a fight . " " What a marvelous proposition , " another woman said . " And what do they get in return ? " Osano looked around , and with a perfectly straight face he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to boo . When I decided to take the job with him , I went back and read everything he 'd written . His early work was first-rate , with sharp , precise scenes like etchings . The novels held together glued by character and story . And a lot of ideas working . His later books became deeper , more thoughtful , the prose more pompous . He was like an important man wearing his decorations . But all his novels invited the critics in , gave them a lot of material to work on , to interpret , to discuss , to stab around . But I thought his last three books were lousy . The critics did n't . I started a new life . I drove to New York every day and worked from 11 A.M. to all hours . The offices of the review were huge , partp255of the newspaper which distributed it . The pace was hectic : books came in literally by the thousands every month , and we had space for only about sixty reviews each week . But all the books had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was genuinely kind to everybody who worked for him . He always asked me about my novel and volunteered to read it before publication and give me some editorial advice , but I was too proud to show it to him . Despite his fame and my lack of it , I thought I was the better novelist . After long evenings working on the schedule of books to be reviewed and whom to give them to , Osano would drink from the bottle of whiskey he kept in his desk and give me long lectures on literature , the life of a writer , publishers , women and anything else that was bugging him at that particular time . He had been working on his big novel , the one that he thought would win him the Nobel Prize , for the last five years . He had already collected an enormous advance on it , and the publisher was getting nervous and pushing him . Osano was really pissed off about that . " That prick , " he said . " He told me to read the classics for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read the classics over again ? Jesus , those old fuckers like Hardy and Tolstoy and Galsworthy had it made . They took forty pages to let out a fart . And you know why ? They had their readers trapped . They had them by the balls . No TV , no radio , no movies . No traveling unless you wanted cysts over your asshole from bouncing around on stagecoaches . In England you could n't even get fucked . Maybe that 's why the French writers were more disciplined . The French at least were into fucking , not like those English Victorian jerkoffs . Now I ask you why should a guy with a TV set and a beach house read Proust ? " I 'd never been able to read Proust , so I nodded . But I had read everybody else and could n't see TV or a beach house taking their place . Osano kept going . " Anna Karenina , they call it a masterpiece . It 's a full-of-shit book . It 's an educated upper-class guy condescending to women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks . He gives us the conventional outlook of that time and place . And then he goes on for three hundred pages on how to run a Russian farm . He sticks that right in there as if anybody gives a skit . And who gives a shit about that asshole Vronsky and his soul ?  |p256Jesus  , I do n't know who 's worse , the Russians or the English . That fucking Dickens and Trollope , five hundred pages were nothing to them . They wrote when they had time off from tending their garden . The French kept it short at least . But how about that fucking Balzac ? I defy ! I defy ! anybody to read him today . " He took a slug of whiskey and gave out a sigh . " None of them knew how to use language . None of them except Flaubert , and he 's not that great . Not that Americans are that much better . That fuck Dreiser does n't even know what words mean . He 's illiterate , I mean that . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . None of those fucking guys could get published today , and if they did , the critics would murder them . Boy , those guys had it made then . No competition . " He paused and sighed wearily . " Merlyn , my boy , we 're a dying breed , writers like us . Find another racket , hustle TV shit , do movies . You can do that stuff with your finger up your ass . " Then , exhausted , he would lie on the couch he kept in his office for his afternoon snooze . I tried to cheer him up . " That could be a great idea for an Esquire article , " I told him . " Take about six classics and murder them . Like that piece you did on modern novelists . " Osano laughed . " Jesus , that was fun . I was kidding and just using it for a power play to give myself more juice and everybody got pissed off . But it worked . It made me bigger and them smaller . And that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it . They jerked themselves off in their ivory towers and thought that would be enough . " " So this should be easy , " I said . " Except that the professor critics will jump on you . " Osano was getting interested . He got up from the couch and went to his desk . " What classic do you hate most ? " " Silas Marner , " I said . " And they still teach it in schools . " " Old dykey George Eliot , " Osano said . " The schoolteachers love her . OK , that 's one . I hate Anna Karenina most . Tolstoy is better than Eliot . Nobody gives a shit about Eliot anymore , but the profs will come out screaming when I hit Tolstoy . " " Dickens ? " I said . " A must , " Osano said . " But not David Copperfield . I got ta admit I love that book . He was really a funny guy , that Dickens . I can getp257him on the sex stuff , though . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of shit . Tons of it . " We started making the list . We had the decency not to molest Flaubert and Jane Austen . But when I gave him Goethe 's Young Werther , he clapped me on the back and howled . " The most ridiculous book ever written , " he said . " I 'll make German hamburgerout of it . " Finally we had a list : Silas MarnerAnna Karenina Young Werther Dombey and Son The Scarlet Letter Lord JimMoby DickProust ( Everything ) Hardy ( Anything ) " We need one more for an even ten , " Osano said . " Shakespeare , " I suggested . Osano shook his head . " I still love Shakespeare . You know it 's ironic ; he wrote for money , he wrote fast , he was an ignorant lowlife , yet nobody could touch him . And he did n't give a shit whether what he wrote was tine or not just so long as it was beautiful or touching . How about Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's too great . Even though I always hated that fucking phony Macduff and that moron Othello . " " You still need one more , " I said . " Yeah , " said Osano , grinning with delight . " Let 's see . Dostocvsky . He 's the guy . How about Brothers Karamazov ? " " I wish you luck , " I said . Osano said thoughtfully , " Nabokov thinks he 's shit . " " I wish him luck too , " I said . So we were stuck , and Osano decided to go with just nine . That would make it different from the usual ten of anything anyway . I wondered why we could n't get up to ten.  |p258He  wrote the article that night and it was published two months later . He was brilliant and infuriating , and all through it he dropped little hints how his great novel in progress would have none of the faults of these classics and would replace them all . The article started a furious uproar , and there were articles all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress , which was just what he wanted . He was a first-rate hustler , Osano . Cully would be proud of him . And I made a note that the two of them should meet someday . In six months I became Osano 's right-hand man . I loved the job . I read a lot of the books and gave notes on them to Osano so that he could assign them for review to the free-lancers we used . Our offices were an ocean of books ; you were swamped with them , you tripped over them , they covered our desks and chairs . They were like those masses of ants and worms covering a dead carcass . I had always loved and revered books , but now I could understand the contempt and disdain of some intellectual reviewers and critics ; they served as valets to heroes . But I loved the reading part , especially novels and biographies . I could n't understand the science books or philosophy or the more erudite critics , so Osano shoveled them off to other specialized assistants . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out with books , and he usually murdered them . When they called or wrote to protest , he told them that he " umpired the ball , not the player , " which lowbrow chatter inflamed them the more . But always keeping his Nobel Prize in mind , he treated some critics very respectfully , gave a lot of space for their articles and books . There were very few of these exceptions . He especially hated English novelists and French philosophers . And yet as time went on , I could see that he hated the job and goofed off from it as much as he could . And he used his position shamelessly . The publishers ' public relations girls soon learned that if they had a " hot " book they wanted to get reviewed , they had only to take Osano out to lunch and lay a big line of bullshit on him . If the girls were oung and pretty , he would kid around and make them understand in a nice way that he would trade space for a piece of ass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me was shocking . I thought thatp259happened only in the movie business . He used the same bargaining techniques on reviewers looking for free-lance work . He had a big budget and we commissioned a lot of reviews that we would pay for but never use . And he always kept his bargains . If they came across , he came across . By the time I arrived he had a nice long string of girlfriends who had access to the most influential literary review in America on the strength of their sexual generosity . I loved the contrast of this with the high intellectual and moral tone of the review . I often stayed late with him in the office on our deadline nights and we would go out for dinner and a drink together , after which he would go get shacked . He would always want to fix me up , but I kept telling him I was happily married . This developed into a standing joke . " You still not tired of fucking your wife ? " he would ask . Just like Cully . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of his business . He would shake his head and say , " You 're the tenth wonder . Married a hundred years and still like fucking your wife . " Sometimes I would give him an irritated look , and he 'd say , quoting from some writer I 'd never read , " No villain need be . Time is the enemy . " It was his favorite quote . He used it often . And working there , I got a taste of the literary world . I had always dreamed about being part of it . I thought of it as a place where no one quarreled or bargained about money . That since these were the people who created the heroes you loved in their books , the creators were like them . And of course , I found out that they were the same as anybody else , only crazier . And I found out that Osano hated all these people too . He 'd give me lectures . " The only special person is the novelist , " Osano would say . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poets and playwrights and those fucking flyweight literary journalists . All fancy dress . All thin . Not a heavy bone in them . You have to have heavy bones in your work when you write a novel . " He mused about that and then wrote it on a piece of paper , and I knew there would be an essay about heavy bones in next Sunday 's review . Then other times he would rant about the lousy writing in the review . Circulation was going down , and he blamed the dullness of the critical profession . " Sure , those fuckers are smart , sure , they have interestng things to say . But they ca n't write a decent sentence . They 're like guysp260who stutter . They break your feet as you try to hang on to every word coming out between those clenched teeth . " Every week Osano had his own essay on the second page . His writing was brilliant , witty and slanted to make as many enemies as possible . One week he published an essay in favor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referendum the death penalty would be approved by an overwhelming vote . That it was only the elitist class like the readers of the review that had managed to bring the death penalty to a standstill in the United States . He claimed this was a conspiracy of the upper echelons of government . He claimed that it was government policy to give the criminal and poverty-stricken elements a license to steal , assault , burglarize , rape and murder the middle class . That this was an outlet provided for the lower classes so that they would not turn revolutionary . That the higher echelons of government had estimated the cost to be less this way . That the elitists lived in safe neighborhoods , sent their children to private schools , hired private security forces and so were safe from the revenge of the misled proletariat . He mocked the liberals who claimed that human life was sacred and that a government policy of putting citizens to death had a brutalizing effect on humanity in general . We were only animals , he said , and should be treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they killed a human being . In fact , he asserted , the executed elephant had more dignity and would go to a higher heaven than the heroin-crazed murderers who were allowed to live in a comfortable prison for five or six years before they were let out to murder more middle-class citizens . When he dealt with whether the death penalty was a deterrent , he pointed out that the English were the most law-abiding people on earth , policemen did n't even carry guns . And he attributed this solely to the fact that the English had executed eight-year-old children for stealing lace handkerchiefs as late as the nineteenth century . Then he admitted that though this had wiped out crime and protected property , it had finally turned those more energetic of the working classes into political animals rather than criminal ones and so had brought socialism to England . One Osano line particularly enraged his readers . " We do n't know if capital punishment is a deterrent , but we know that men we execute will not murder again . "  |p261He  finished the essay by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give their lower classes a license to steal and kill so that they would not become political revolutionists . It was an outrageous essay , but he wrote it so well that the whole thing appeared logical . Letters of protest rolled in by the hundreds from the most famous and important social thinkers of our liberal intellectual readership . A special letter composed by a radical organization and signed by the most important writers in America was sent to the publisher asking that Osano be removed as editor of the review . Osano printed it in the next issue . He was still too famous to be fired . Everybody was waiting for his " great " novel to be finished . The one that would assure him of the Nobel Prize . Sometimes when I went into his office , he would be writing on long yellow sheets , which he would put into a desk drawer when I entered and I knew this was the famous work in progress . I never asked him about it and he never volunteered anything . A few months later he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the review in which he quoted studies to show that stereotypes were perhaps true . That Italians were born criminals , that Jews were better at making money than anybody else and better violin players and medical students , that worst of all , more than any other people they put their parents into old folks ' homes . Then he quoted studies to show that the Irish were drunks owing perhaps to some unknown chemical deficiency or diet or the fact that they were repressed homosexuals . And so on . That really brought the screams . But it did n't stop Osano . In my opinion he was going crazy . One week he took the front page for his own personal review of a book on helicopters . That crazy bee in his bonnet was still buzzing . Helicopters would replace the automobile , and when that happened , all the millions of miles of concrete highways would be torn up and replaced by farmland . The helicopter would help return families to their nuclear structure because then it would be easy for people to visit far-flung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe because he hated cars . For his weekends in the Hamptons he always took a seaplane or a helicopter specially chartered . He claimed that only a few more technical inventions wouldp262make the helicopter as easy to handle as the automobile . He pointed out that the automatic shift had made millions of women drivers who could n't handle shifting gears . And this little aside brought down the wrath of Women 's Liberation groups . What made it worse , in that very same week a serious study of Hemingwayhad been published by one of the most respected literary scholars in America . This scholar had a powerful network of influential friends , and he had spent ten years on the study . It got front-page reviews in every publication but ours . Osano gave it page five and three columns instead of the full page . Later that week the publisher sent for him , and he spent three hours in the big office suite on the top floor , explaining his actions . He came down , grinning from ear to ear , and said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll put some life in this fucking rag yet . But I think you should start looking for another job . I do n't have to worry , I 'm nearly finished with my novel and then I 'll be home free . " By that time I had been working for him for nearly a year and I could n't understand how he got any work done at all . He was screwing everything he could get his hands on , plus he went to all the New York parties . During that time he had knocked out a quickie short novel for a hundred grand advance . He wrote it in the office on the review 's time , and it took him two months . The critics were crazy about it , but it did n't sell very much though it was nominated for the National Book Award . I read the book , and the prose was brilliantly obscure , the characterizations ridiculous , the plotting lunatic . To me it was a foolish book despite some complicated ideas . He had a first-rate mind , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a total failure as a novel . He never asked if I had read it . He obviously did n't want my opinion . He knew it was full of shit , I guess . Because one day he said , " Now that I 've got a bankroll I can finish the big book . " A sort of apology . I got to like Osano , but I was always just a little afraid of him . He could draw me out as nobody else could . He made me talk about literature and gambling and even women . And then , when he had measured me , he would lay me out . He had a keen eye for pretentiousness in everyone else but himself . When I told him about Jordan 's killing himself in Vegas and everything that had happened afterward and how I felt it had changed my life , hep263thought that over for a long time and then he gave me his insights combined with a lecture . " You hold on to that story , you always go back to it , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wading through the piles of hooks in his office , waving his arms around . " Because you know that 's the one area you 're not in danger . You 'll never knock yourself off . You 'll never be that shattered . You know I like you , you would n't be my right-hand man if I did n't . And I trust you more than anybody I know . Listen , let me confess something to you . I had to redraw my will last week because of that fucking Wendy . " Wendy had been his third wife and still drove him crazy with her demands though she had remarried since their divorce . When he just mentioned her , his eyes went a little crazy . But then he calmed down . He gave me one of his sweet smiles that made him look like a little kid , though he was well into his fifties by now . " I hope you do n't mind , " he said . " But I 've named you as my literary executor . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the whole thing . I did n't want him to trust me that much or like me that much . I did n't feel that way about him . I had come to enjoy his company , indeed , to be fascinated by how his mind worked . And though I tried to deny it , I was impressed by his literary fame . I thought of him as rich and famous and powerful , and the fact that he had to trust me so much showed me how vulnerable he was , and that dismayed me . It shattered some of my illusions about him . But then he went on about me . " You know , underneath everything , you have a contempt for Jordan you do n't dare admit to yourself . I 've listened to that story of yours I do n't know how many tines . Sure , you liked him , sure , you felt sorry for him ; maybe you even understood him . Maybe . But you ca n't accept the fact that a guy that had so much going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a ten times worse life than he had and you would never do such a thing . You 're even happy . You 're living a shitty life , you never had anything , you knocked your balls off working , you 've got a limited bourgeois marriage and you 're an artist with half your life gone and no real success . And you 're basically happy . Christ , you still enjoy fucking your wife andp264you 've been married  --  what ?  --  ten , fifteen years . You 're either the most insensitive prick I ever met or the most together . One thing I know , you 're the toughest . You live in your own world , you do exactly what you want to do . You control your life . You never get into trouble , and when you do , you do n't panic ; you get out of it . Well , I admire you , but I do n't envy you . I 've never seen you do or say a really mean thing , but I do n't think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steering your life . " And then he waited for me to react . He was grinning , the sneaky green eyes challenging . I knew he was having fun just laying it on , but I also knew he meant it a little and I was hurt . There were a lot of things I wanted to say . I wanted to tell him how it was growing up an orphan . That I had missed what was basic , the core of almost every human being 's experience . That I had no family , no social antennae , nothing to bind myself to the rest of the world . I had only my brother , Artie . When people talked about life , I could n't really grasp what they meant until after I had married Vallie . That was why I had volunteered to fight in the war . I had understood that war was another universal experience , and I had n't wanted to be left out of it . And I had been right . The war had been my family , no matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't missed it . And what Osano missed or did n't bother saying because he assumed I knew it was that it was n't that easy to exercise control over your own life . And what he could n't know was that the coin of happiness was a currency I could never understand . I had spent most of my early life being unhappy purely because of external circumstance . I had become relatively happy again because of external circumstance . Marrying Valerie , having kids , having a skill or art or the ability to produce written matter that earned me a living made me happy . It was a controlled happiness built on what I had gained from a dead loss . And so , very valuable to me . I knew I lived a limited life , what seemed to be a life that was bare , bourgeois . That I had very few friends , no sociability , little interest in success . I just wanted to make it through life , or so I thought . And Osano , watching me , was still smiling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've ever seen . You never let anybody get near you . You never let anybody know what you really think . "  |p265At  this I had to protest . " Listen , you ask me my opinion about anything and I 'll give it to you . Do n't even ask . Your last book was a piece of shit , and you run this review like a lunatic . " Osano laughed . " I do n't mean that kind of stuff . I never said you were n't honest . But let it go . You 'll know what I 'm talking about someday . Especially if you start chasing broads and wind up with somebody like Wendy . " Wendy came around to the review offices once in a while . She was a striking brunette with crazy eyes and a body loaded with sexual energy . She was very bright , and Osano would give her books to review . She was the only one of his ex-wives who was not afraid of him , and she had made his life miserable ever since they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments , she tried to have him arrested . Whenever he published a new book , she went to court to get her child support and alimony raised . She had taken a twenty-year-old writer into her apartment and supported him . The writer was heavy on drugs , and Osano worried about what he might do to the kids . Osano told stories about their marriage that were to me incredible . That once , going to a party , they had gotten into the elevator and Wendy refused to tell him the floor the party was on simply because they had quarreled . He became so infuriated that he had started to choke her to make her tell him , playing a game , as he called it , of " choke the chicken . " A game that was his fondest memory of the marriage . Her face turning black , she shook her head , still refusing to answer his question about where the party was being held . He had to release her . He knew she was crazier than he was . Sometimes when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have him thrown out of the apartment and the police would come and be stunned by her unreasonableness . They would ice Osano 's clothes scissored to pieces on the floor . She admitted doing it , but that did n't give Osano a right to hit her . What she left out was that she had sat on the pile of scissored suits and shirts and tics and masturbated over them with a vibrator . And Osano had stories to tell about the vibrator . She had gone to a psychiatrist because she could not achieve orgasms . After sixp266months she had admitted to Osano that the psychiatrist was fucking her as part of the therapy . Osano was n't jealous ; by this time he really loathed her , " loathe " he said , " not hate . There 's a difference . " But Osano would get furious every time he got the bill from the psychiatrist and he would rage to her , " I pay a guy a hundred dollars a week to fuck my wife and they call that modern medicine ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she was so mad that she stopped going to the psychiatrist and bought a vibrator . Every evening before dinner she locked herself into the bedroom to shut out the kids and masturbated with the machine . She always achieved orgasm . But she laid down the strict rule that she was never to be disturbed during that hour , by the children or her husband . The whole family , even the children , referred to it as " The Happy Hour . " What made Osano finally leave her , as he told the story , was when she started carrying on about how F. Scott Fitzgerald had stolen all his best stuff from his wife , Zelda . That she would have become a great novelist if her husband had not done this . Osano grabbed her by the hair of her head and shoved her nose into The Great Gatsby . " Read this , you dumb cunt , " he said . " Read ten sentences , then read his wife 's book . Then come and tell me that shit . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thing . He punched her in the face and blackened both her eyes and then left for good . Just recently Wendy had won another infuriating victory over Osano . He knew she was giving the child-support payments to her young lover . But one day his daughter came to him and asked for money for clothes . She explained that her gynecologist had told her not to wear jeans anymore because of a vaginal irritation , and when she had asked her mother for money for dresses , her mother said , " Ask your father . " This was after they had been divorced for five years . To avoid an argument , Osano gave his daughter 's support money to her directly . Wendy did n't object . But after a year she took Osano to court for the year 's money . The daughter testified for her father . Osano had been sure he would win when the judge knew allp267the circumstances . But the judge told him sternly not only to pay the money directly to the mother but also to pay the support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So in effect he paid twice . Wendy was so delighted with her victory that she tried to be friendly with him afterward . In front of their children he brushed off her affectionate advances and said coldly , " You are the worst cunt I 've ever seen . " The next time Wendy came around to the review he refused her entrance to his office and cut off all the work he had given her . And what amazed him was that she could n't understand why he loathed her . She raged about him to her friends and spread the word that he had never satisfied her in bed , that he could n't get it up . That he was a repressed homosexual who really liked little boys . She tried to keep him from having the kids for the summer , but Osano won that battle . Then he published a maliciouslywitty short story about her in a national magazine . Maybe he could n't handle her in life , but in fiction he painted a truly terrible portrait , and since everybody in the literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately . She was crushed , as much as it was possible for her to be , and she left Osano alone after that . But she rankled in him like some poison . He could n't bear to think about her without his face flushing and his eyes going a little crazy . One day he came into the office and told me that the movies had bought one of his old novels to make into a picture and he had to go out there for a conference on the script , all expenses paid . He offered to take me along . I said OK but that I would like to drop off in Las Vegas to visit an old friend for a day or two while we were out there . He said that would be OK . He was between wives and he hated to travel alone or be alone and he felt he was going into enemy territory . He wanted a friend along with him . Anyway , that was what he said . And since I 'd never been to California and I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good deal . I did n't know that I would more than earn my way.  |p269I  was in Vegas when Osano finished up on the conferences for that movie script of his book . So I took the short flight to LA to fly home with him , keep him company from LA to New York . Cully wanted me to bring Osano to Vegas just to meet him . I could n't talk Osano into it , so I went to LA . In his suite at the Beverly Hills Hotel Osano was more pissed off than I had ever seen him . He felt the movie industry had treated him like shit . Did n't they know that he was world-famous , the darling of literary critics from London to New Delhi , from Moscow to Sydney , Australia ? He was famous in thirty languages , including the different variations of the Slavic . What he left out was that every movie made from one of his books had lost money for some strange reason . And Osano was pissed off about other things . His ego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important than the writer . When Osano tried to get a girlfriend of his a small part in the film , he could n't swing it , and that pissed him off . It pissed him even more when the cameraman and the supporting actor got their girlfriends into the movie . The fucking cameraman and a lousy supporting actor had more clout than the great Osano . I just hoped I could get him on the plane before he went crazy and started tearing the whole studio apart and wound up in the clink . And wep270had a whole day and night to wait in LA for the plane the next morning . To quiet him down , I brought him around to his West Coast agent , a very hip , tennis-playing guy who had a lot of clients in show business . He also had some of the best-looking girlfriends I had ever seen . His name was Doran Rudd . Doran did his best , but when disaster waits , nothing helps . " You need a night out , " Doran said , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a little tranquilizer so you can sleep tonight . Maybe a blow job pill . " Doran was absolutely charming with women . But alone with men he insulted the female species . Well , Osano had to go into a little act before he gave the OK . After all , a world-famous writer , a future Nobel literary prizewinner , does n't want to be fixed up like some teenage kid . But the agent had handled guys like Osano before . Doran Rudd had fixed up a secretary of state , a President , the biggest evangelist in America who drew millions of believers to the Holy Tabernacle and was the horniest big-cocked son of a bitch in the world , so Doran said . It was a pleasure to watch the agent smooth Osano 's ruffled ego . This was n't a Vegas operation , where girls were sent to your room like a pizza . This was class . " I 've got a really intelligent girl who 's dying to meet you , " Doran told Osano . " She 's read all your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . No shit . And she 's not one of your starlets . She has a psychology degree from the University of California , and she takes bit parts in movies so that she can make contacts to write a script . Just the girl for you . " Of course , he did n't fool Osano . Osano knew the joke was on him , that he was to be conned into what he really wanted . So he could n't resist saying as Doran picked up the phone , " That 's all very well , but do I get to fuck her ? " The agent was already dialing with a gold-headed pencil . " You got a ninety percent chance , " he said . Osano asked quickly , " How do you get that figure ? " He always did that whenever somebody pulled a statistic on him . He hated statistics . He even believed the New York Times made up its stock market quotations just because one of his IBM stocks had beenp271listed at 295 and , when he tried to sell it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stopped dialing . " I sent her out with five guys since I 've known her . Four of them scored . " " That 's eighty percent , " Osano said . Doran started dialing again . When a voice answered , he leaned back in his swivel chair and gave us a wink . Then he went into his dance . I admired it . I really admired it . He was so good . His voice was so warm , his laugh so infectious . " Katherine , " the agent crooned . " My favorite , favorite client . Listen , I was talking to the director who 's going to make that western with Clint Eastwood . Would you believe he remembered you from that one interview last year ? He said you gave the best reading of anybody , but he had to go with a name and after the picture he was sorry he did . Anyway , he wants to see you tomorrow at eleven or three . I 'll call you later to get the exact time . OK ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think this is the big break . I think your time has come . No , no kidding . " He listened for a while . " Yeah , yeah , I think you 'd be great in that . Absolutely marvelous . " He rolled his eyes at us comically which made me dislike him . " Yeah , I 'll sound them out and get back to you . Hey , listen , guess who I 've got in my office right now . Nope . Nope . Listen , it 's a writer . Osano . Yeah , no kidding . No , honest . Yes , he really is . And believe it or not he happened to mention you not by name , but we were talking about movies and he mentioned that part you did , that cameo role , in City Death . Is n't that funny ? Yeah , he 's a fan of yours . Yeah , I told him you love his work . Listen , I 've got a great idea . I 'm going out to dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come beautify our table ? Great . I 'll have a limo pick you up at eight . OK , sweetheart . You 're my baby . I know he 'll like you . He does n't want to meet any starlets . He does n't like the starlet type . He needs conversation and I just realized that you two were made for each other . Right , good-bye , honey . " The agent hung up and leaned back and gave us his charming smile . " She 's really a nice cunt , " he said . I could see Osano was a little depressed by the whole scene . He really liked women , and he hated to see them hustled . He oftenp272said he 'd rather be hustled by a woman than hustle her . In fact , he once gave me his whole philosophy about being in love . How it was better to be the victim . " Look at it this way , " Osano had said . " When you 're in love with a broad , you 're getting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're the guy who 's feeling great , you 're the guy who 's enjoying every minute . She 's the one who 's having a lousy time . She 's working ... you 're playing . So why complain when she finally dumps you and you know you 've been conned ? " Well , his philosophy was put to the test that night . He got home before midnight and called my room and then came in for a drink to tell me what happened with Katherine . Katherine 's percentage for scores had gone down that night . She had been a charming vibrant little brunette and swarmed all over Osano . She loved him . She adored him . She was thrilled to death that she was having dinner with him . Doran got the message and disappeared after coffee . Osano and Katherine were having a final loosening-up bottle of champagne before going back to the hotel to get down to business . That 's when Osano 's luck turned bad , though he could still have bailed out if it had n't been for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most unusual actors in Hollywood . His name was Dickie Sanders , and he had won an Oscar and had been in six successful movies . What made him unique was that he was a dwarf . That 's not as bad as it sounds . He just missed being a very short man . And he was a very handsome guy , for a dwarf . You could say he was a miniature James Dean . He had the same sad , sweet smile which he used with devastating and calculated effect on women . They could n't resist him . And as Doran said later , all bullshit aside , what balling broad could resist going to bed with a handsome dwarf ? So when Dickie Sanders walked into the restaurant , it was no contest . He was alone and he stopped at their table to say hello to Katherine ; it seemed they knew each other , she 'd had a bit part in one of his movies . Anyway , Katherine adored him twice as much as she adored Osano . And Osano got so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the hotel alone . " What a fucking town , " he said . " A guy like me loses out to a fucking dwarf . " He was really sore . His fame did n't mean anything.  |p273The  Nobel Prize coming did n't mean anything . His Pulitzers and National Book Awards cut no ice . He came second to a dwarf actor , and he could n't stand it . I had to carry him to his room finally and pour him into his bed . My final words of consolation to him were : " Listen , he 's not a dwarf , he 's just a very short guy . " Next morning , when Osano and I got on that 747 to New York , he was still depressed . Not only because he 'd brought Katherine 's average down , but because they 'd botched the movie version of his book . He knew it was a lousy script , and he was right . So he was really in a bad mood on the plane and bullied a scotch off the stewardess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats near the bulkhead , and in the two seats across the aisle were one of those middle-aged couples , very thin , very elegant . The man had a beaten-down , unhappy look on his face that was sort of appealing . You got the impression that he was living in a private hell , but one that he deserved . Deserved because of his outward arrogance , the richness of his dress , the spitefulness of his eyes . He was suffering , and by Christ he was going to make everybody else around him suffer too , if he thought they would stand for it . His wife looked like the classic spoiled woman . She was obviouslyrich , richer than her husband , though possibly they were both rich . The stamp was on them in the way they took the menu from the stewardess . The way they glanced at Osano sipping his technically illegal drink . The woman had that bold handsomeness preserved by top-notch plastic surgery and glossed over with the even tan of daily sunlamps and Southern sun . And had that discontented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At her feet and up against the bulkhead wall was a wire-mesh box which held maybe the prettiest French poodle in the whole world . It had curly silver fur which fell into ringlets over its eyes . It had a pink mouth and pink ribbon bow over its head . It even had a beautiful tail with a pink bow on it that wagged around . It was the happiest little dog you ever saw and the sweetest-looking . The two miserable human beings that owned it obviously took pleasure from owning such a treasure . The man 's face softened a little as he looked at thep274poodle . The woman did n't show pleasure , but a proprietary pride , like an older ugly woman in charge of her beautiful virginal daughter that she is preparing for the marketplace . When she reached out her hand for the poodle to lick lasciviously , it was like a Pope extending his ring to be kissed . The great thing about Osano was that he never missed anything even when he seemed to be looking the other way . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his seat . But now he said to me , " I 'd rather get a blow job from that dog than that broad . " The jet engines made it impossible for the woman across the aisle to hear , but I felt nervous anyway . She gave us a coldly dirty look , but maybe that 's the way she always looked at people . Then I felt guilty at having condemned her and her husband . They were , after all , two human beings . Where did I come off putting them down on sheer speculation ? So I said to Osano , " Maybe they 're not as bad as they look . " " Yes , they are , " he said . That was n't worthy of him . He could be chauvinistic , racist and narrow-minded but only off the top of his head . It really did n't mean anything . So I let it go , and as the pretty stewardess imprisoned us in our seats for dinner , I told him stories about Vegas . He could n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people across the aisle , forgetting about them , I said to him , " You know what gamblers call suicide ? " " No , " Osano said . I smiled . " They call it the Big Ace . " Osano shook his head . " Is n't that marvelous ? " he said dryly . I saw he was a little contemptuous of the melodrama of the phrase , but I kept on . " That 's what Cully said to me that morning when Jordan did it . Cully came down and he said , You know what that fucking Jordy did ? He pulled the Big Ace out of his sleeve . The prick used his Big Ace . ' " I paused , remembering it more clearly now years later . It was funny . I had never remembered that phrase before or Cully using it that night . " He capitalized it in his voice , you know . The Big Ace . " " Why do you think he really did it ? " Osano asked . He was not too interested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell knows ? " I said . " I thought I was so smart . Ip275thought I had him figured . I nearly had him figured , but then he faked me out . That 's what kills me . He made me disbelieve in his humanity , his tragic humanity . Never let anybody make you disbelieve in anybody 's humanity . " Osano grinned , nodded his head at the people across the aisle . " Like them ? " he said . And then I realized that this was what made me tell him the story . I glanced at the woman and man . " Maybe . " " OK , " he said . " But sometimes it goes against the grain . Especiallyrich people . You know what 's wrong with rich people ? They think they 're as good as anybody else just because they got lots of dough . " " They 're not ? " I asked . " No , " Osano said . " They 're like hunchbacks . " " Hunchbacks are not as good as anybody else ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " Osano said . " Nor are people with one eye , basket cases , and critics and ugly broads and chickenshit guys . They got ta work at being as good as other people . Those two people did n't work at it . They never got there . " He was being a little irrational and illogical , not at his most brilliant . But what the hell , he 'd had a bad week . And it 's of everybody who gets his love life ruined by a dwarf . I let it ride . We finished our dinner , Osano drinking the lousy champagne and eating the lousy food that even in first class you would trade in for a Coney Island hot dog . As they lowered the movie screen , Osano bolted out of his chair and went up the steps to the 747 dome lounge . I finished my coffee and followed him up there . He was seated in a long-backed chair and had lit up one of his long Havana cigars . He offered me one and I took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that delighted Osano . He was always generous but a little careful with his Havanas . If you got one from him , he watched you closely to see if you enjoyed it enough to deserve it . The lounge was beginning to fill up . The stewardess on duty was busy making drinks . When she brought Osano his martini , she sat on the arm of his lounge chair and he put one hand in her lap to hold her hand . I could see that one of the great things about being as famous asp276Osano was that you get away with stuff like that . In the first place , you had the confidence . In the second place , the young girl , instead of thinking you a dirty old man , is usually enormously flattered that somebody so important could think her that attractive . If Osano wanted to screw her , she must be something special . They did n't know that Osano was so horny he would screw anything with skirts . Which is not as bad as it sounds since a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The young girl was charmed by Osano . Then a good-looking woman passenger started coming on to him , an older woman with a crazy , interesting face . She told us about how she had just recovered from heart surgery and had n't fucked for six months and was now ready to go . That 's the kind of things women always told Osano . They felt they could tell him anything because he was a writer and so would understand anything . Also , because he was famous and that would make them interesting to him . Osano took out his heart-shaped Tiffany pillbox . It was filled with white tablets . He took one and offered the box to the heart lady and the stewardess . " Come on , " he said . " It 's an upper . We 'll really be flying high . " Then he changed his mind . " No , not you , " he said to the heart lady . " Not in your condition . " That 's when I knew the heart lady was out of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before sexual contact so that he would be immunized against VD . And he always used this trick to make a prospective partner take them to double the insurance . He popped one in his mouth and washed it down with scotch . The stewardess laughingly took one , and Osano watched her with a cheerful smile . He offered me the box and I shook my head . The stewardess was really a pretty young thing , but she could n't handle Osano and the heart lady . Trying to get the attention back to her , she said sweetly to Osano , " Are you married ? " Now she knew , as everybody knew , that not only was Osano married , but he had been married at least five times . She did n't know that a question like that irritated Osano because he always felt a little guilty about cheating  --  on all his wives , even the ones he 'd divorced . Osano grinned at the stewardess and said coolly , " I 'm married , I got a mistress and I got a steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have some fun with . "  |p277It  was insulting . The young girl flushed and took off to serve the other passengers drinks . Osano settled down to enjoy the conversation with the heart lady , giving advice on her first fuck . He was putting her on a little . " Listen , " he said . " You do n't want to straight fuck for the first time out . It wo n't be a good fuck for the guy because you 'll be a little scared . The thing to do is have the guy go down on you while you 're half asleep . Take a tranquilizer and then , just as you 're dozing off , he eats you up , you know ? And get a guy who 's good at it . A real gentleman blow job artist . " The woman turned a little red . Osano grinned . He knew what he was doing . I got a little embarrassed too . I always fall a little in love with strange women who hit me right . I could see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her . She did n't know that she was too old for him and he was just playing his cards very coolly to nail the young stewardess . There we were speeding along at six hundred miles an hour and not feeling a thing . But Osano was getting drunker , and things started going bad . The heart lady was boozy maudlin about dying and how to find the right guy to go down on her the right way . That made Osano nervous . He said to her , " You can always play the Big Ace . " Of course , she did n't know what he was talking about . But she knew she was being dismissed , and the hurt look on her face irritated Osano even more . He ordered another drink , and the stewardess , jealous and pissed off that he had ignored her , gave him the drink and slipped away in the cool , insulting way the young can always use to put older people down . Osano showed his age that day . At that moment the couple with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , she was one woman I would never fall in love with . The discontented mouth , that artificially tinted nutbrownface with all the lines of life excised by a surgeon 's knife , were too repellent , no fantasies could be spun around them unlecc you were into sadomaso stuff . The man carried the beautiful little poodle , the dog 's tongue hanging out with happiness . Carrying the poodle gave the sourfacedman a touching air of vulnerability . As usual Osano seemed not to notice them , though they gave him glances that showed they knew who he was . Probably from TV . Osano had been on TV ap278hundred times and always making himself interesting in a foolish way that lessened his real worth . The couple ordered drinks . The woman said something to the man and he obediently dropped the poodle to the floor . The poodle stayed close to them , then wandered around a bit , sniffing at all the people and at all the chairs . I knew Osano hated animals , but he did n't seem to notice the poodle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart lady . The heart lady leaned over to fix the pink ribbon over the poodle 's head and get her hand licked by the poodle 's little pink tongue . I never could understand the animal thing , but this poodle was , in a funny kind of way , sexy . I wondered what went on with that sour-faced couple . The poodle pattered around the lounge , wandered back to its owners and sat on the feet of the woman . She put on dark glasses , which for some reason seemed ominous , and when the stewardess brought her drink , she said something to the young girl . The stewardess looked at her in astonishment . I guess it was at this moment that I got a little nervous . I knew Osano was all jazzed up . He hated being trapped in a plane , he hated being trapped in a conversation with a woman he did n't really want to screw . What he was thinking about was how to get the young stewardess into a toilet and give her a quick , savage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink and leaned over to whisper in my ear . I could see Osano getting jealous . He thought the girl was coming on to me , and that was an insult to his fame more than anything else . He could understand the girl wanting a younger , better-looking guy but not turning down his fame . But the stewardess was whispering a different kind of trouble . She said , " That woman wants me to tell Mr. Osano to put out his cigar . She says it 's bothering her dog . " Jesus Christ . The dog was n't even supposed to be up in the lounge running around . It was supposed to be in its box . Everybodyknew that . The girl whispered worriedly , " What should I do ? " I guess what happened next was partly my fault . I knew Osano could go crazy at any time and that this was a prime time . But I was always curious about how people react . I wanted to see if thep279stewardess would really have to nerve to tell a guy like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of a fucking dog . Especially when Osano had paid for a first class ticket just to smoke it in the lounge . I also wanted to see Osano put the hardfacedsnotty woman in her place . I would have ditched my cigar and let it ride . But I knew Osano . He would send the plane down into hell first . The stewardess was waiting for an answer . I shrugged . " Whateveryour job makes you do , " I said . And it was a malicious answer . I guess the stewardess felt the same way . Or maybe she just wanted to humiliate Osano because he was no longer paying any attention to her . Or maybe , because she was just a kid , she took what she thought was the easy way out . Osano , if you did n't know him , looked easier to handle than the bitch lady . Well , we all made a bad mistake . The stewardess stood next to Osano and said , " Sir , would you mind putting out your cigar ? That lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's startling green eyes went cold as ice . He gave the stewardess a long , hard look . " Let me hear that again , " he said . Right then I was ready to jump out of the plane . I saw the look of maniacal rage form over Osano 's face . It was no longer a joke . The woman was staring at Osano with distaste . She was dying for an argument , a real uproar . You could see she 'd love a fight . The husband glanced out the window , studying the limitless horizon . Obviously this was a familiar scene and he had every confidence that his wife would prevail . He even had a slight , satisfied smile . Only the sweet-looking poodle was distressed . It was gasping for air and giving delicate little hiccups . The lounge was smoky but not from just Osano 's cigar . Nearly everybody had cigarettes going , and you got the feeling that the poodle owners would make everybody stop smoking . The stewardess , frightened by Osano 's face , was paralyzed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not intimidated . You could see that she just loved seeing that look of maniacal rage on Osano 's Dace . You could also see that she never in her life had been punched in the mouth , that she had never gotten a few teethp280knocked out . The thought had never occurred to her . So she even leaned toward Osano to speak to him , putting her face in range . I almost closed my eyes . In fact , I did close my eyes for a fraction of a second and I could hear the woman in her cultured , cold voice saying very flatly to Osano , " Your cigar is distressing my dog . Could you please just stop ? " The words were snotty enough , but the tone was insulting beyond any mere words . I could see she was waiting for an argument about her dog 's not being allowed in the lounge , how the lounge was for smoking . How she realized that if she had said the smoke was distressing her personally , Osano would get rid of the cigar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her dog . She wanted a scene . Osano grasped all this in a second . He understood everything . And I think that was what drove him crazy . I saw that smile come over his face , a smile that could be infinitely charming but for the cold green eyes that were pure maniac . He did n't yell at her . He did n't punch her in the face . He gave ner husband one look to see what he would do . The husband smiled faintly . He liked what his wife was doing , or so it seemed . Then with a deliberate motion Osano put out his cigar in the welled tray of his seat . The woman watched him with contempt . Then Osano reached out his arm across the table and you could see the woman thought he was going to pet the poodle . I knew better . Osano 's hand went down over the poodle 's head and around its neck . What happened next was too quick for me to stop . He lifted the poor dog up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both hands . The poodle gasped and choked , its pink-beribboned tail wagging in distress . Its eyes started bulging out of its mattress of silky ringed fur . The woman screamed and sprang up and clawed at Osano 's face . The husband did n't move out of his seat . At that moment the plane hit a small air pocket and we all lurched . But Osano , drunk , all his balance concentrated on strangling the poodle , lost his footing and went sprawling down the aisle , his hands still tight around the dog 's throat . To get up he had to turn the dog loose . The woman was screaming something about killing him . The stewardess was screaming out of shock . Osano , standingp281straight up , smiled around the lounge and then advanced toward the woman , still screaming at him . She thought that now he would be ashamed of what he had done , that she could abuse him . She did n't know that he had already made up his mind to strangle her as he had the dog . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Osano said with maniacal quiet , " You cunt , now you get it . " And he lunged for her . He was really crazy . He hit her in the face . I ducked in front and grabbed him . But he had his hands around her throat and she screamed . And then it became a madhouse . The plane must have had security guards in plain clothes because two men took Osano very professionally by the arms and peeled his coat back to form a straitjacket . But he was wild and he was throwing them around anyway . Everybody watched , horrified . I tried to quiet Osano down , but he could n't hear anything . He was berserk . He was screaming curses at the woman and her husband . The two security men were trying to gentle him down , addressing him by name , and one , a goodlookingstrong boy , was asking him if they let him go would he behave . Osano still fought . Then the strong boy lost his temper . Now Osano was in an uncontrollable rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was famous and knew he would be insulated against any retaliations for his rage . The young strong boy understood this by instinct , but now he was affronted that Osano did n't respect his superior youthful strength . And he got mad . He took a handful of Osano 's hair and yanked his head back so hard he nearly snapped his neck . Then he put his arm around Osano 's neck and said , " You son of a bitch , I 'll break it . " Osano went still . Jesus , it was a mess after that . The captain of the plane wanted to put Osano in a straitjacket , but I talked him out of it . The security cleared out the lounge , and Osano and I sat there with them for the rest of the trip . They did n't let us off in New York until the plane was empty , so we never saw the woman again . But that last glimpse of her was enough . They had washed the blood off her face , but she had one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The husband carried the poodle , still alive , wagging its tail desperately for affection and protection . Later there were some legal complaints that the lawyers handled . Of course , itp282got in all the papers . The great American novelist and prime candidate for the Nobel Prize had almost murdered a little French poodle . Poor dog . Poor Osano . The cunt had turned out to be a large stockholder in the airline plus having millions of other dollars , and of course , she could n't even threaten never to fly that airline again . As for Osano he was perfectly happy . He had no feeling about animals . He said , " As long as I can eat them , I can kill them . " When I pointed out that he had never eaten dog meat , he just shrugged and said , " Cook it right and I 'll eat it . " One thing Osano missed . That crazy woman had her humanity too . OK , she was crazy . OK , she deserved a bloody mouth , it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't deserve what Osano did to her . She really could n't help the kind of person she was , I thought then . The earlier Osano would have seen all that . For some reason he could n't now.  |p283THE  sexy poodle did n't die , so the lady did n't press charges . She did n't seem to mind getting her face smashed or it was n't important to her or to her husband . She might even have enjoyed it . She sent Osano a friendly note , leaving the door open for them to get together . Osano gave a funny little growl and tossed the note into his wastepaper basket . " Why do n't you give her a try ? " I said . " She might be interesting . " " I do n't like hitting women , " Osano said . " That bitch wants me to use her as a punching bag . " " She could be another Wendy , " I said . I knew Wendy always had some sort of fascination for him despite their being divorced all these years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus , " Osano said . " That 's all I need . " But he smiled . He knew what I meant . That maybe beating women did n't displease him that much . But he wanted to show me I was wrong . " Wendy was the only wife I had that made me hit her , " he said . " All my other wives , they fucked my best friends , they stole my money , they beat me for alimony , they lied about me , but I never hit them , I never even disliked them . I 'm good friends with all my other wives . But that fucking Wendy is some piece of work . A class by herself . If I 'd stayed married to her , I 'd have killed her . " But the poodle strangling had got around in the literary circles ofp284New York . Osano worried about his chances of getting the Nobel Prize . " Those fucking Scandinavians love dogs , " he said . He fired up his active campaign for the Nobel by writing letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept publishing articles and reviews on the most important critical works to appear in the review . Plus essays on literature which I always thought were full of shit . Many times when I went into his office he would be working on his novel , filling yellow lined sheets . His great novel , because it was the only thing he wrote in longhand . The rest of his stuff he banged out with two fingers on the typewriter he could swivel to from his executive desk piled with books . He was the fastest typist I have ever seen even with just two fingers . He sounded like a machine gun , literally . And with that machine-gun typing he wrote the definition of what the great American novel should be , explained why England no longer produced great fiction except in the spy genre , took apart the latest works and sometimes the body of work of guys like Faulkner , Mailer , Styron , Jones , anybody who could give him competition for the Nobel . He was so brilliant , the language so charged that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demolished his opponents and left the field clear for himself . The only trouble was that when you went to his own work , he had only his first two novels published twenty years ago that could give him serious claim to a literary reputation . The rest of his novels and nonfiction work were not that good . The truth was that over the last ten years he had lost a great deal of his popular success and his literary reputation . He had published too many books done off the top of his head , made too many enemies with the high-handed way he ran the review . Even when he did some ass kissing by praising powerful literary figures , he did it with such arrogance and condescension , did it with himself mixed up with it in some way ( as his Einstein article had been as much about himself as about Einstein ) that he made enemies of the people he was stroking . He wrote one line that really caused an uproar . He said the huge difference between French literature of the nineteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex and the English did n't . Our review clientele boiled with rage . On top of this his personal behavior was scandalous . The publishersof the review had learned of the airplane incident , and itp285had leaked into the gossip columns . On one of his lectures at a California college he met a young nineteen-year-old literary studentwho looked more like a cheerleader or starlet than a lover of books , which she really was . He brought her to New York to live with him . She lasted about six months , but during that time he took her to all the literary parties . Osano was in his middle fifties , not yet gray but definitely paunchy . When you saw them together , you got a little uncomfortable . Especially when Osano was drunk and she had to carry him home . Plus he was drinking while he was working in the office . Plus he was cheating on his nineteen-year-old girlfriend with a forty-year-old female novelist who had just published a best-seller . The book was n't really that good , but Osano wrote a full-page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American literature . And he did one thing I really hated . He would give a quote to any friend who asked . So you saw novels coming out that were lousy but with a quote from Osano saying something like : " This is the finest Southern novel since Styron 's Lie Down in Darkness . " Or , " A shocking book that will dismay you , " which was kind of sly because he was trying to play both ends against the middle , doing his friend the favor and yet trying to warn the reader off the book with an ambiguous quote . It was easy for me to see that he was coming apart in some way . I thought maybe he was going crazy . But I did n't know from what . His face looked unhealthy , puffy ; his green eyes had a glitter that was not really normal . And there was something wrong with his walk , a hitch in his stride or a little waver to the left sometimes . I worried about him . Because despite my disapproval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his cutthroat maneuvers , his trying to screw every dame he came into contact with , I had an affection for him . He would talk to me about the novel I was working on , encourage me , give me advice , try to lend me money though I knew he was in hock up to his ears and spent money at an enormous rate supporting his five ex-wives and eight or nine children . I was awestricken by the amount of work he published , flawed though it was . He always appeared in one of the monthlies , sometimes in two or three ; every year he published a nonfiction hook on some subject the publishers thought was " hot . " He editedp286the review and did a long essay for it every week . He did some movie work . He earned enormous sums , but he was always broke . And I knew he owed a fortune . Not only from borrowing money but drawing advances on future books . I mentioned this to him , that he was digging a hole he 'd never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away impatiently . " I 've got my ace in the hole , " he said . " I got the big novel nearly finished . Another year iaybe . And then I 'll be rich again . And then on to Scandinavia for the Nobel Prize . Think of all those big blond broads we can fuck . " He always included me on the trip for the Nobel . The biggest fights we had were when he 'd ask me about what I thought of one of his essays on literature in general . And I would infuriate him with my by now familiar line that I was just a storyteller . " You 're an artist with divine inspiration , " I 'd tell him . " You 're the intellectual , you 've got a fucking brain that could squirt out enough bullshit for a hundred courses on modern literature . I 'm just a safecracker . I put my ear to the wall and wait to hear the tumblers fall in place . " " You and your safecracker bullshit , " Osano said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas . You 're a real artist . But you like the idea of being a magician , a trickster , that you can control everything , what you write , your life in general , that you can beat all the traps . That 's how you operate . " " You have the wrong idea of a magician , " I told him . " A magician does magic . That 's all . " " And you think that 's enough ? " Osano asked . He had a slightly sad smile on his face . " It 's enough for me , " I said . Osano nodded his head . " You know , I was a great magician once , you read my first book . All magic , right ? " I was glad that I could agree . I had an affection for that book . " Pure magic , " I said . " But it was n't enough , " Osano said . " Not for me . " Then too bad for you , I thought . And he seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think , " he said . " I just could n't do it again because I do n't want to do it or I ca n't do it maybe . I was n't a magician anymore after that book . I became a writer . "  |p287I  shrugged a little unsympathetically , I guess . Osano saw it and said , " And my life went to shit , but you can see that . I envy you your life . Everything is under control . You do n't drink , you do n't smoke , you do n't chase broads . You just write and gamble and play the good father and husband . You 're a very unflashy magician , Merlyn . You 're a very safe magician . A safe life , safe books ; you 've made despair disappear . " He was pissed off at me . He thought he was driving into the bone . He did n't know he was full of shit . And I did n't mind , that meant my magic was working . That was all he could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had my life under control , that I did n't suffer or permit myself to , that I did n't feel the bouts of loneliness that drove him on to different women , to booze , to his snorts of cocaine . Two things he did n't realize. , That he was suffering because he was actually going crazy , not suffering . The other was that everybody else in the world suffered and was lonely and made the best of it . That it was no big deal . In fact , you could say that life itself was n't a big deal , never mind his fucking literature . And then suddenly I had troubles from an unexpected quarter . One day at the review I got a call from Artie 's wife , Pam . She said she wanted to see me about something important , and she wanted to see me without Artie . Could I come over right away ? I felt a real panic . In the back of my mind I was always worried about Artie. lie was really frail and always looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was so panicky I begged her to tell me what it was over the phone , but she would n't . She did tell me that there was nothing physically wrong , no medical reports of doom . It was a personal problem she and Artie were having , and she needed my help . Immediately , selfishly , I was relieved . Obviously she had a problem , not Artie . But still I took off early from work and drove out to Long Island to see her . Artie lived on the North Shore of Long Island and I lived on the South Shore . So it really was n't much out of my way . I figured I could listen to her and be home for dinner , just a little late . I did n't bother to call Valerie.  |p288I  always liked going to Artie 's house . He had five kids , but they were nice kids who had a lot of friends who were always around and Pam never seemed to mind . She had big jars of cookes to feed them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other kids playing on the lawn . I said hi to the kids , and they gave me a brief hi back . Pam took me into the kitchen with its huge bay window . She had coffee ready and poured some . She kept her head down and then suddenly looked up at me and said , " Artie has a girlfriend . " Despite her having had five kids , Pam was still very younglookingwith a fine figure , tall , slender , lanky before the kids , and one of those sensual faces that had a Madonna kind of look . She came from a Midwest town , Artie had met her in college and her father was president of a small bank . Nobody in the last three generations of her family had ever had more than two kids , and she was a hero-martyr to her parents because of the five births . They could n't understand it , but I did . I . had once asked Artie about it and he had said , " Behind that Madonna face is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine . " If any other husband had said that about his wife , I would have been offended . " Lucky you , " I had said . " Yeah , " Artie said . " But I think she feels sorry for me , you know , the asylum business . And she wants to make sure I never feel lonely again . Something like . that . " " Lucky , lucky you , " I had said . And so now , when Pam made her accusation , I was a little angry . I knew Artie . I knew it was n't possible for him to cheat on his wife . That he would never endanger the family he had built up or the happiness it gave him . Pam 's tall form was drooping ; tears were in her eyes . But she was watching my face . If Artie were having an affair , the only one he would ever tell was me . And she was hoping I would give away the secret by some expression on my face . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had women running after him and he hated it . He 's the straightest guy in the world . You know I would n't try to cover for him . I would n't rat on him , but I would n't cover for him . "  | " I know that , " Pam said . " But he comes home late at least three times a week . And last night he had lipstick on his shirt . And he makes phone calls after I go up to bed , late at night . Does he call you ? " " No , " I said . And now I felt shitty . It might be true . I still did n't believe it , but I had to find out . " And he 's spending extra money he never spent before , " Pam said . " Oh , shit . " She was crying openly now . " Will he be home for dinner tonight ? " I asked . Pam nodded . I picked up the kitchen phone and called Valerie and told her I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a while on the spur of the moment when I had an urge to see him , so she did n't ask any questions . When I hung up the phone , I said to Pam , " You got enough to feed me ? " She smiled and nodded her head . " Of course , " she said . " I 'll go down and pick him up at the station , " I said . " And we 'll have this all straightened out before we eat dinner . " I burlesqued it a bit and said , " My brother is innocent . " " Oh , sure , " Pam said . But she smiled . Down at the station , as I waited for the train to come in , I felt sorry for Pam and Artie . There was a little smugness in my pity . I was the guy Artie always had to bail out and finally I was going to bail him out . Despite all the evidence , the lipstick on the shirt , the late hours and phone calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basically innocent . The worst it could be was some young girl being so persistent that he finally weakened a little , maybe . Even now I could n't believe it . Mixed with the pity was the envy I always felt about Artie 's being so attractive to women in a way I could never be . With just a touch of satisfaction I felt it was not all that bad being ugly . When Artie got off the train , he was n't too surprised to see me . I had done this before , visiting him unexpectedly and meeting his train . I always felt good doing it , and he was always glad to see me . And it always made me feel good to see that he was glad to see me waiting for him . This time , watching him carefully , I noticed he was n't quite that glad to see me today . " What the hell are you doing here ? " he said , but he gave me a hug and he smiled . He had an extraordinarily sweet smile for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child and it had never changed . " I came to save your ass , " I said cheerfully . " Pam finally got the goods on you . He laughed . " Jesus , not that shit again . " Pam 's jealousy was alwaysgood for a laugh . " Yep , " I said . " The late hours , the late phone calls and now , finally , the classic evidence : lipstick on your shirt . " I was feeling great because just by seeing Artie and talking to him I knew it was all a mistake . But suddenly Artie sat down on one of the station benches . His face looked very tired . I was standing over him and beginning to feel just a little uneasy . Artie looked up at me . I saw a strange look of pity on his face . " Do n't worry , " I said . " I 'll fix everything . " He tried to smile . " Merlyn the Magician , " he said . " You 'd better put on your fucking magic hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cigarette . I thought again that he smoked too much . I sat down next to him . Oh , shit , I thought . And my mind was racing on to how to square things between him and Pam . One thing I knew , I did n't want to lie to her or have Artie lie to her . " I 'm not cheating on Pam , " Artie said . " And that 's all I want to tell you . " There was no question about my believing him . He would never lie to me . " Right , " I said . " But you have to tell Pam what 's going on or she 'll go crazy . She called me at work . " " If I tell Pam , I have to tell you , " Artie said . " You do n't want to hear it . " " So tell me , " I said . " What the hell 's the difference ? You always tell me everything . How can it hurt ? " Artie dropped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " OK , " he said . He put his hand on my arm and I felt a sudden sense of dread . When we were children alone together , he always did that to comfort me . " Let me finish , do n't interrupt , " he said . " OK , " I said . My face was suddenly very warm . I could n't think of what was coming . " For the last couple of years I 've been trying to find our mother , " Artie said . " Who she is , where she is , what we are . A month ago I found her . "  |p291I  was standing up . I pulled my arm away from his . Artie stood up and tried to hold me again . " She 's a drunk , " he said . " She wears lipstick . She looks pretty good . But she 's all alone in the world . She wants to see you , she says that she could n't help  --  " I broke in on him . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't ever tell me any more . You do what you want , but I 'll see her in hell before I 'll see her alive . " " Hey , come on , come on , " Artie said . He tried to put his hand on me again and I broke away and walked toward the car . Artie followed me . We got in and I drove him to the house . By this time I was under control and I could see that Artie was distressed , so I said to him , " You 'd better tell Pam . " Artie said , " I will . " I stopped in the driveway of the house . " You coming in for dinner ? " Artie asked . He was standing by my open window , and again he reached in to put his hand on my arm . " No , " I said . I watched him as he went into the house , shooing the last of the kids still playing on the lawn into the house with him . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had trained myself all my life to be more careful when most people became more reckless . When I got home , I could see by Vallie 's face that she knew about what happened . The kids were in bed , and she had dinner for me on the kitchen table . While I ate , she ran her hand over the back of my head and neck when she went by to the stove . She sat opposite , drinking coffee , waiting for me to open the subject . Then she remembered . " Pam wants you to call her . " I called . Pam was trying to make some apology for having gotten nee into such a mess . I told her it was no mess , and did she feel better now that she knew the truth ? Pam giggled and said , " Christ , I think I 'd rather it were a girlfriend . " She was cheerful again . And now our roles were reversed . Early that day I had pitied her , she was the person in terrible danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help her . Now she seemed to think it was unfair that the roles were reversed . That was what the apology was about . I told her not to worry . Pam stumbled over what she wanted to say next . " Merlyn , you did n't really mean it , about your mother , that you wo n't see her ? " " Does Artie believe me ? " I asked her.  | " He says he always knew it , " Pam said . " He would n't have told you until he 'd softened you up . Except for me causing the trouble . He was teed off at me for bringing it all on . " I laughed . " See , " I said , " it started off as a bad day for you and now it 's a bad day for him . He 's the injured party . Better him than you . " " Sure , " Pam said . " Listen , I 'm sorry for you , really . " " It has nothing at all to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OK and thanks and hung up . Valerie was waiting for me now . She was watching me intently . She 'd been briefed by Pam and maybe even by Artie on how to handle this , and she was being careful . But I guess she had n't really grasped it . She and Pam were really good women , but they did n't understand . Both their parents had made trouble and objections about them marrying orphans with no traceable lineage . I could imagine the horror stories told about similar cases . What if there had been insanity or degeneracy in our family ? Or black blood or Jewish blood or Protestant blood , all that fucking shit . Well , now here was a nice piece of evidence turned up when it was no longer needed . I could figure out that Pam and Valerie were not too happy about Artie 's romanticism , his digging up the lost link of a mother . " Do you want her here to the house so that she can see the children ? " Valerie asked . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little terrified . I could see how she was thinking what if her children rejected her someday . " She 's your mother , " Valerie said . " She must have had a very unhappy life . " " Do you know what the word orphan ' means ? " I said . " Have you looked it up in the dictionary ? It means a child who has lost both parents through death . Or a young animal that has been deserted or has lost its mother . Which one do you want ? " " OK , " Valerie said . She looked terrified . She went to look in on the kids and then went into our bedroom . I could hear her going into the bathroom and preparing for bed . I stayed up late reading and making notes , and when I went to bed , she was sound asleep . It was all over in a couple of months . Artie called me up one dayp293and told me his mother had disappeared again . We arranged to meet in the city and have dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never talk about it with our wives present , as if it were too shameful for their knowledge . Artie seemed cheerful . He told me she had left a note . He told me that she drank a lot and always wanted to go to bars and pick up men . That she was a middle-aged floozy but that he liked her . He had made her stop drinking , he had bought her new clothes , he had rented her a nicely furnished apartment , given her an allowance . She had told him everything that had happened to her . It had n't really been her fault . I stopped him there . I did n't want to hear about that . " Are you going to look for her again ? " I asked him . Artie smiled his sad , beautiful smile . " No , " he said . " You know , I was a pain in the ass to her even now . She really did n't like having me around . At first , when I found her , she played the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a sense of guilt that maybe she could make things up to me by letting me take care of her . But she really did n't like it . She even made a pass at me one day , I think , just to get some excitement . " He laughed . " I wanted her to come to the house , but she never would . It 's just as well . " " How did Pam take the whole business ? " I asked . Artie laughed out loud . " Jesus , she was even jealous of my mother . When I told her it was all over , you should have seen the look of relief on her face . One thing I have to say for you , brother , you took the news without cracking a muscle . " " Because I do n't give a shit one way or the other , " I said . " Yeah , " Artie said . " I know . It does n't matter . I do n't think you would have liked her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a mild one , but he was in the hospital for weeks and off from work another month . I went to see him in the hospital every day , and he kept insisting that it had been some sort of indigestion , that it was a borderline case . I went down to the library and read everything I could about heart attacks . I found out that his reaction was a common one with heart attack victims and that sometimes they were right . But Pam was panic-stricken . When Artie came out of the hospital , she put him on a strict diet , threw all the cigarettes out of the house andp294stopped smoking so that Artie could quit . It was hard for him , but he did . And maybe the heart attack did scare him because now he took care of himself . He took the long walks the doctor prescribed , ate carefully and never touched tobacco . Six months later he looked better than he had ever looked in his life and Pam and I stopped giving each other panicky looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , he 's stopped smoking , " Pam said . " He was up to three packs a day . That 's what did him in . " I nodded , but I did n't believe it . I always believed it was that two months he spent trying to claim his mother that did him in . And as soon as Artie was OK , I got into trouble . I lost my job on the literary review . Not through any fault of mine but because Osano got fired and as his right-hand man I was fired with him . Osano had weathered all the storms . His contempt of the most powerful literary circles in the country , the political intelligentsia , the culture fanatics , the liberals , the conservatives , Women 's Liberation , the radicals , his sexual escapades , his gambling on sports , his use of his position to lobby for the Nobel Prize . Plus a nonfiction book he published in defense of pornography , not for its redeemingsocial value , but as antielitist pleasure of the poor in intellect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire him , but the circulation of the review had doubled since he became editor . By this time I was making good money . I wrote a lot of Osano 's articles for him . I could imitate his style pretty well , and he would start me off with a fifteen-minute harangue on how he felt about a particular subject , always brilliantly crazy . It was easy for me to write the article based on his fifteen minutes of ranting . Then he 'd go over and put in a few of his masterful touches and we 'd split the money . Just half his money was twice what I got paid for an article . Even that did n't get us fired . It was his ex-wife Wendy who did us in . Though that 's maybe unfair ; Osano did us in , Wendy handed him the knife . Osano had spent four weeks in Hollywood while I ran the review for him . He was completing some sort of movie deal , and during the four weeks we used a courier to fly out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Osano finally came back to New York , he gave a party for all his friends to celebrate his homecomingand the big chunk of money he had earned in Hollywood . The party was held at his East Side brownstone which his latest ex-wife used with their batch of three kids . Osano was living in a small studio apartment in the Village , the only thing he could afford , but too small for the party . I went because he insisted that I go . Valerie did n't come . She did n't like Osano and she did n't like parties outside her family circle . Over the years we had come to an unspoken agreement . We excused each other from each other 's social lives whenever possible . My reason was that I was too busy working on my novel , my job and free-lance writing assignments . Her excuse was that she had to take care of the kids and did n't trust baby-sitters . We both enjoyed the arrangement . It was easier for her than it was for me since I had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the review . Anyway , Osano 's party was one of the big events of the literary set in New York . The top people of the New York Times Book Review came , the critics for most of the magazines and novelists that Osano was still friendly with . I was sitting in a corner talking with Osano 's latest ex-wife when I saw Wendy come in and I thought immediately , Jesus , trouble , I knew she had not been invited . Osano spotted her at the same time and started walking toward her with the peculiar lurching gait he 'd acquired in the last few months . He was a little drunk , and I was afraid he might lose his temper and cause a scene or do something crazy , so I got up and joined them . I arrived just in time to hear Osano greet her . " What the fuck do you want ? " he said . He could be frightening when he was angry , but from what he had told me about Wendy I knew she was the one person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised at her reaction . Wendy was dressed in jeans and sweater and a scarf over her head . It made her thin dark face Medea-like . Her wiry black hair escaped from the scarf like thin black snakes . She looked at Osano with a deadly calm which held malevolent triumph . She was consumed with hatred . She took a long lookp296around the room as if drinking in what she now no longer could claim any part of , the glittering literary world of Osano that he had effectively banished her from . It was a look of satisfaction . Then she said to Osano , " I have something very important to tell you . " Osano downed his glass of scotch . He gave her an ugly grin . " So tell me and get the fuck out . " Wendy said very seriously , " It 's bad news . " Osano laughed uproariously and genuinely . That really tickled him . " You 're always bad news , " he said and laughed again . Wendy watched him with quiet satisfaction . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shit , " Osano said . But he knew Wendy , she would delight in a scene . So he took her up the stairs to his study . I figured later that he did n't take her to one of the bedrooms because deep down he was afraid he would try to fuck her , she still had that kind of hold on him . And he knew she would delight in refusing him . But it was a mistake to bring her into the study . It was his favorite room , still kept for him as a place to work . It had a huge window which he loved to stare out of while he was writing and watch the goings-on in the street below . I hung around at the bottom of the stairs . I really do n't know why , but I felt that Osano was going to need help . So I was the first one to hear Wendy scream in terror and the first one to act on that scream . I ran up the stairs and kicked in the door of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach Wendy . She was flailing her thin arms at him , trying to keep him away . Her bony hands were curled , the fingers extended like claws to scratch his face . She was terrified , but she was enjoying it too . I could see that . Osano 's face was bleeding from two long furrows on his right cheek . And before I could stop him , he had hit Wendy in the face so that she swayed toward him . In one terrible swift motion he picked her up as if she were a weightless doll and threw her through the picture window with tremendous force . The window shattered , and Wendy sailed through it to the street below . I do n't know whether I was more horrified by the sight of Wendy 's tiny body breaking through the window or Osano 's completely maniacal face . I ran out of the room and shouted , " Call anp297ambulance . " I snatched up a coat from the hallway and ran out in the street . Wendy was lying on the cement like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the house , she was teetering up on her arms and legs but had only gotten to her knees . She looked like a spider trying to walk , and then she collapsed again . I knelt beside her and covered her with the coat . I took off my jacket and folded it beneath her head . She was in pain , but there was no blood trickling out of her mouth or ears and there was not that deadly film over the eyes that long ago during the war I had recognized as a danger signal . Her face finally was calm and at peace with itself . I held her hand , it was warm , and she opened her eyes . " You 'll be OK , " I said . " An ambulance is coming . You 'll be OK . " She opened her eyes and smiled at me . She looked very beautiful , and for the first time I understood Osano 's being fascinated by her . She was in pain but actually grinning , " I fixed that son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got her to the hospital , they found that she had suffered a broken toe and a fracture of the shoulder clavicle . She was conscious enough to tell what had happened , and the cops went looking for Osano and took him away . I called Osano 's lawyer . He told me to keep my mouth shut as much as I possibly could and that he would straighten everything out . He had known Osano and Wendy a long time and he understood the whole thing before I did . He told me to stay where I was until he called . Needless to say , the party broke up after detectives questioned some of the people , including myself . I said I had n't seen anything except Wendy falling through the window . No , I had n't seen Osano near her , I told them . And they left it at that . Osano 's ex-wife gave me a drink and sat next to me on the sofa . She had a funny little smile on her face . " I always knew this would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours for the lawyer to call me . He said he had Osano out on bail but that it would be a good idea for someone to be with him a couple of days . Osano would be going to his studio apartment in the Village . Could I go down there to keepp298him company and keep him from talking to the press ? I said I would . Then the lawyer briefed me . Osano had testified that Wendy had attacked him and that he had flung her away from him and she had lost her balance and went through the window . That was the story given to the newspapers . The lawyer was sure that he could get Wendy to go along with the story out of her own selfinterest . If Osano went to jail , she would lose out on alimony and child support . It would all be smoothed over in a couple of days if Osano could be kept from saying something outrageous . Osano should be at his apartment in an hour , the lawyer would bring him there . I left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sat on the stoop of the apartment house until the lawyer 's chauffeured limo rolled up . Osano got out . He looked dreadful . His eyes were bulging out of his head , and his skin was dead white with strain . He walked right past me , and I got into the elevator with him . He took his keys out , but his hands were shaking and I did it for him . When we were in his tiny studio apartment , Osano flopped down on the couch that opened out into a bed . He still had n't said a word to me . He was lying there now , his face covering his hands out of weariness , not despair . I looked around the studio apartment and thought , here was Osano , one of the most famous writers in the world and he lived in this hole . But then I remembered that he rarely lived here . That he was usually living in his house in the Hamptons or up in Provincetown . Or with one of the rich divorced women he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I sat down in a dusty armchair and kicked a pile of books into a corner . " I told the cops I did n't see anything , " I said to Osano . Osano sat up and his hands were away from his face . To my amazement I could see that wild grin on his face . " Jesus , how did you like the way she sailed through the air . I always said she was a fucking witch . I did n't throw her that hard . She was flying on her own . " I stared at him . " I think you 're going fucking crazy , " I said . " I think you 'd better see a doctor . " My voice was cold . I could n't forget Wendy lying in the street.  | " Shit , she 's going to be OK , " Osano said . " And you do n't ask why . Or do you think I throw all my ex-wives out the window ? " " There 's no excuse , " I said . Osano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll bet twenty bucks when I tell you what she said to me , you 'll agree you 'd have done the same thing . " " Bet , " I said . I went into the bathroom and wet a facecloth and threw it to him . He wiped his face and neck and sighed with pleasure as the cold water refreshed his skin . Osano hunched forward on the couch . " She reminded me how she had written me letters the last two months begging for money for our kid . Of course , I did n't send her any money , she 'd spend it on herself . Then she said that she had n't wanted to bother me while I was busy in Hollywood but that our youngest boy had gottensick with spinal meningitis and because she did n't have enough money she had to put him in the charity ward in the city hospital , Bellevue no less . Can you imagine that fucking cunt ? She did n't call me that he was sick because she wanted to lay all that shit on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Osano loved all his kids from his different wives . I was amazed at this capacity in him . He always sent them birthday presents and always had them with him for the summers . And he dropped in to see them sporadically to take them to the theater or to dinner or a ball game . I was astonished now that he did n't seem worried about his kid being sick . He understood what I was feeling . " The kid only had a high fever , some sort of respiratory infection . While you were being so gallant about Wendy , I was calling the hospital before the cops came . They told me there was nothing to worry about . I called my doctor and he 's having the kid taken to a private hospital . So everything 's OK . " " Do you want me to hang around ? " I asked him . Osano shook his head . " I have to go see my kid and take care of the other kids now that I 've deprived them of their mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Before I left him , I asked Osano one question . " When you threw her out that window , did you remember that it was really only two stories above the street ? "  |p300He  grinned at me again . " Sure , " he said . " And besides , I never figured she 'd sail that far . I tell you she 's a witch . " All the New York newspapers had front-page stories the next day . Osano was still famous enough for that kind of treatment . At least Osano did n't go to jail because Wendy did n't press charges . She said that maybe she had stumbled and gone through the window . But that was the next day and the damage had been done . Osano was made to resign gracefully from the review and I resigned with him . One columnist , trying to be funny , speculated that if Osano won the Nobel Prize , he would be the first one to win who had ever thrown his wife out of the window . But the truth was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hopes in that direction . You could n't give the sober respectable Nobel to a sordid character like Osano . And Osano did n't help matters much when a little later he wrote a satirical article on the ten best ways to murder your wife . But right now we both had a problem . I had to earn a living free lance without a job . Osano had to lie low someplace where the press could n't keep hounding him . I could solve Osano 's problem . I called Cully in Las Vegas and explained what had happened . I asked Cully if he could stash Osano in the Xanadu Hotel for a couple of weeks . I knew nobody would be looking for him there . And Osano was agreeable . He had never been to Las Vegas.  |p301WITH  Osano safely stashed in Vegas I had to fix my other problem . I had no job , so I took on as much free-lance work as I could get . I did book reviews for Time magazine , the New York Times , and the new editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me it was too nerve-racking . I never knew how much money was going to come in at any particular time . And so I decided that I would go all-out to finish my novel and hope that it would make a lot of money . For the next two years my life was very simple . I spent twelve to fifteen hours a day in my workroom . I went with my wife to the supermarket . I took my kids to Jones Beach in the summer , on Sundays , to give Valerie a rest . Sometimes at midnight I took Dexamyls to keep me awake so that I could work until three or four in the morning . During that time I saw Eddie Lancer for dinner a few times in New York . Eddie had become primarily a screenwriter in Hollywood , and it was clear that he would no longer write novels . He enjoyed the life out there , the women , the easy money , and swore he would never write another novel again . Four of his screenplays had become hit movies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a job working with him if I was willing to come out there , and I told him no . I could n't see myself working in the movie business . Because despite the funny stories Eddie told me , whatp302was very clear was that being a writer in the movies was no fun . You were no longer an artist . You were just a translater of other people 's ideas . During those two years I saw Osano about once a month . He had stayed a week in Vegas and then disappeared . Cully called me to complain that Osano had run away with his favorite girlfriend , a girl named Charlie Brown . Cully had n't been mad . He had just been astonished . He told me the girl was beautiful , was making a fortune in Vegas under his guidance and was living a great life , and she had abandoned all this to go with a fat old writer who not only had a beer gut but was the craziest guy Cully had ever seen . I told Cully that that was another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Osano in New York , I would buy her a plane ticket back to Vegas . " Just tell her to get in touch with me , " Cully said . " Tell her I miss her , tell her I love her , tell her anything you want . I just want to get her back . That girl is worth a fortune to me in Vegas . " OK , " I said . But when I met Osano in New York for dinner , he was always alone and he did n't much look like anybody who could hold the affections of a young , beautiful girl with the advantages that Cully had described . It 's funny when you hear of somebody 's success , of his fame . That fame , like a shooting star that has appeared out of nowhere . But the way it happened to me was surprisingly tame . I lived the life of a hermit for two years and at the end the book was finished and I turned it into my publisher and I forgot about it . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me they had sold my novel to a paperback house for reprint for over half a million dollars . I was stunned . I really could n't react . Everybody , my editor , my agent , Osano , Cully , had warned me that a book about kidnapping a child where the kidnapper is a hero would not appeal to a mass public . I expressed my astonishment to my editor , and he said , " You told such a great story that it does n't matter . " When I went home to Valerie that night and told her what had happened , she seemed not to be surprised either . She merely said calmly , " We can buy a bigger house . The kids are getting bigger ,  |p303they  need more room . " And then life simply went on as before , except that Valerie found a house only ten minutes from her parents and we bought it and moved in . By that time the novel was published . It made all the best-seller lists all over the country . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change my life in any way . In thinking about this I realized that it was because I had such few friends . There was Cully , there was Osano , there was Eddie Lancer and that was it . Of course , my brother , Artie , was terribly proud of me and wanted to give a big party until I told him he could give the party but I would n't come . What really touched me was a review of the book by Osano which appeared on the front page of the literary review . He praised me for the right reasons and pointed out the true flaws . In his usual fashion he overrated the book because I was a friend of his . And then , of course , he went on and talked about himself and his novel in progress . I called his apartment , but there was no answer . I wrote him a letter and got a letter in return . We had dinner together in New York . He looked terrible , but he had a great-looking young blonde who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . He introduced her as " Charlie Brown , " and I realized she was Cully 's girl , but I never gave her Cully 's message . Why should I hurt Osano ? There was one funny incident I always remembered . I told Valerie to go out shopping and buy herself some new clothes , whatever she wanted , and that I would mind the kids for that day . She went with some of her girlfriends and came back with an armful of packages . I was trying to work on a new book but really could n't get into it , so she showed me what she had bought . She unwrapped a package and showed me a new yellow dress . " It cost ninety dollars , " Valerie said . " Can you imagine ninety dollars for a little summer dress ? " " It looks beautiful , " I said dutifully . She was holding it against her neck . " You know , " she said , " I really could n't make up my mind whether I liked the yellow one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow . I think I look better in the yellow , do n't you ? "  |p304I  laughed . I said , " Honey , did n't it occur to you that you could buy both ? " She looked at me stunned for a moment , and then she too laughed . And I said , " You can buy a yellow and a green and a blue and a red . " And we both smiled at each other , and for the first time we realized , I think , that we had entered some sort of new life . But on the whole I found success not to be as interesting or as satisfying as I had thought it would be . So , as I usually did , I read up on the subject and I found that my case was not unusual , that in fact , many men who had fought all their lives to reach the top of their professions immediately celebrated by throwing themselves out of a high window . It was wintertime , and I decided to take the whole family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the first time in our married life that we had been able to afford to go away . My kids had never even been to summer camp . We had a great time swimming , enjoying the heat , enjoying the strange streets and food , the delight of leaving the cold winter one morning and that afternoon being in the broiling sun , enjoying the balmy breezes . At night I took Valerie to the hotel gambling casino while the children dutifully sat in the great wicker chairs of the lobby , waiting for us . Every fifteen minutes or so Valerie would run down and see if they were OK , and finally she took them all to our suite of rooms and I gambled until four o'clock in the morning . Now that I was rich , naturally I was lucky , and I won a few thousand dollars and in a funny way I enjoyed winning in the casino more than the success and the huge sums of money I had made so far on the book . When we got back home , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studio , Malomar Films , had spent a hundred thousand dollars for the film rights to my book and another fifty thousand dollars plus expenses for me to go out to Hollywood to write the screenplay . I talked it over with Valerie . I really did n't want to write movie scripts . I told her I would sell the book but turn down the screenwritingcontract . I thought she would be pleased , but instead , shep305said , " I think it would be good for you to go out there . I think it would be good for you to meet more people , to know more people . You know I worry about you sometimes because you 're so soli-tary . " " We could all go out , " I said . " No , " Valerie said . " I 'm really happy here with my family and we ca n't take the children out of school and I would n't want them to grow up in California . " Like everybody else in New York , Valerie regarded California as an exotic outpost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad preachers who would shoot a Catholic on sight . " The contract is for six months , " I said , " but I could work for a month and then go back and forth . " " That sounds perfect , " Valerie said , " and besides , to tell you the truth we could use a rest from each other . " That surprised me . " I do n't need a rest from you , " I said . " But I need a rest from you , " Valerie said . " It 's nerve-racking to have a man working at home . Ask any woman . It just upsets the whole routine of my keeping house . I never could say anything before because you could n't afford an outside studio to work in , but now that you can , I wish you would n't work at home anymore . You can rent a place and leave in the morning and come home at night . I 'm sure you 'd work better . " I do n't know even now why her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy staying and working at home , and I was really hurt that she did n't feel the same way , and I think it was this that made me decide to do the screenplay of my novel . It was a childish reaction . If she did n't want me home , I 'd leave and see how she liked it . At that time I swear that Hollywood was a nice place to read about , but I did n't even want to visit it . I realized a part of my life was over . In his review Osano had written , " All novelists , bad and good , are heroes . They fight alone , they must have the faith of saints . They are more often defeated than victorious and they are shown no mercy by a villainous world . Their strength fails ( that 's why most novels have weak spots , are an easy target for attack ) ; the troubles of the real world , the illness ofp306children , the betrayal by friends , the treacheries of wives must all be brushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling on miracles for fresh energy . " I disapproved of his melodramatics , but it was true that I felt as if I were deserting the company of heroes . I did n't give a damn if that was a typical writer 's sentimentality.  |p309MALOMAR  Films , though a subsidiary of Moses Wartberg 's TriCultureStudios , operated on a completely independent basis , creatively , and had its own small lot . And so Bernard Malomar had free rein for his planned picture of the John Merlyn novel . All Malomar wanted to do was make good movies , and that was never easy , not with Wartberg 's Tri-Culture Studios hovering over his every move . He hated Wartberg . They were acknowledged enemies , but Wartberg , as an enemy , was interesting , fun to deal with . Also , Malomar respected Wartberg 's financial and managementgenius . He knew that , moviemakers like himself could not exist without it . Malomar in his plush suite of offices nestled in a corner of his own lot had to put up with a bigger pain in the ass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wartberg was cancer of the rectum , as Malomar jokingly said , Jack Houlinan was hemorrhoids and , on a day-to-day basis , far more irritating . Jack Houlinan , vice-president in charge of creative public relations , played his role of the number one PR genius with a killing sincerity . When he asked you to do something outrageous and was refused , he acknowledged with violent enthusiasm your right to refuse . His favorite line was : " Anything you say is OK with me . I would never , never try to persuade you to do anything you don'tp310want to do . I only asked . " This would be after an hour 's pitch of why you had to jump off the Empire State Building to make sure your new picture got some space in the Times . But with his bosses , like the VP in charge of production at Wartberg 's Tri-Culture International Studios , with this Merlyn picture for Malomar Films and his own personal client , Ugo Kellino , he was much more frank , more human . And now he was talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for bullshit . " We 're in trouble , " Houlinan said . " I think this fucking picture can be the biggest bomb since Nagasaki . " Malomar was the youngest studio chief since Thalberg and liked to play a dumb genius role . With a straight face he said , " I do n't know that picture , and I think you 're full of shit . I think you 're worried about Kellino . You want us to spend a fortune just because that prick decided to direct himself and you want to get him insurance . " Houlinan was Ugo Kellino 's personal PR rep with a retainer of fifty grand a year . Kellino was a great actor but almost certifiably insane with ego , a not uncommon disease in top actors , actresses , directors and even script girls who fancied themselves screenplay writers . Ego in movie land was like TB in a mining town . Endemic and ravaging but not necessarily fatal . In fact , their egos made many of them more interesting than they would otherwise be . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had been included in a list of the fifty most famous men in the world . The laminated news story hung in his den with his own legend in red crayon that said , " For fucking . " Houlinan always said , his voice emphatic , admiring , " Kellino would fuck a snake . " Accenting the word as if the phrase were not an old macho cliche but coined now especially for his client . A year ago Kellino had insisted on directing his next picture . He was one of the few stars who could get away with such a demand . But he had been put on a strict budget , his upfront money and percentages pledged for a completion bond . Malomar Films was in for a top two million and then off the hook . Just in case Kellino went crazy and started shooting a hundred takes of each scene with his latest girlfriend opposite him or his latest boyfriend under him.  |p311Both  of which he had proceeded to do with no visible harm to the picture . But then he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights soft and shadowy on his despairing face , he had told the story of his tragic boyhood in excruciating flashbacks . To explain why he was fucking boys and girls on the screen . The implication was that if he had had a decent childhood , he would never have fucked anybody . And he had final cut , the studio could n't doctor up the picture in the editing room legally . Except that they would anyway if necessary . Malomar was n't too worried . A Kellino starrer would get the studio 's two million back . That was certain . Everything else was gravy . And if worse came to worst , he could bury the picture in distribution ; nobody would see it . And he had come out of the deal with his main objective . That Kellino would star in John Merlyn 's blockbuster best-selling novel that Malomar felt in his bones would make the studio a fortune . Houlinan said , " We have to get a special campaign . We have to spend a lot of money . We have to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Malomar said . He was usually more polite . But he was tired of Kellino , he was tired of Houlinan and he was tired of motion pictures . Which did n't mean anything . He was tired of beautiful women and charming men . He was tired of California weather . To divert himself he studied Houlinan . He had a longstandinggrudge against him and Kellino . Houlinan was beautifully dressed . Silk suit , silk tie , Italian shoes , Piaget watch . His eyeglass frames were specially made , black and gold-flecked . He had the benign sweet Irish face of the leprechaun preachers that filled the California TV screens on Sunday mornings . It was hard to believe he was a black-hearted son of a bitch and proud of it . Years ago Kellino and Malomar had quarreled in a public restaurant , a vulgar shouting match that had become a humiliating story in the columns and trades . And Houlinan had masterminded a campaign to make Kellino come out of the argument as the hero and Malomar the craven villain , the weakling studio chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius all right . But a little shortsighted . Malomar had made him pay ever since . For the last five years not a month had gone by that the papers had not carried a story about Kellino 's helping somebody lessp312fortunate than himself . Did a poor girl with leukemia need a special blood transfusion from a donor who lived in Siberia ? Page five of any newspaper would tell you Kellino had sent his private jet to Siberia . Did a black go to a Southern jail for protesting ? Kellino posted bail . When an Italian policeman with seven kids got chopped down by a Black Panther , ambush in Harlem , did not Kellino send a check for ten thousand dollars to the widow and set up a scholarship for all seven children ? When a Black Panther was accused of murdering a cop , Kellino sent ten thousand dollars to his defense fund . Whenever a famous old-time movie star became ill , the papers noted that Kellino picked up his hospital tab and assured him of a cameo role in his next film so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the old codgers with ten million stashed and a hatred for his profession gave an interview insulting Kellino 's generosity , spitting on it in fact , and it was so funny that even the great Houlinan could n't get it squashed . And Houlinan had more hidden talents . He was a pimp whose fine nose for new fresh starlets made him the Daniel Boone of Hollywood 's celluloid wilderness . Houlinan often boasted of his technique . " Tell any actress she was great in her bit part . Tell her that three times in one evening and she pulls down your pants and tears your cock off by the roots . " He was Kellino 's advance scout , many times testing the girl 's talents in bed before passing her on . Those who were too neurotic , even by the lenient industry standards , never got past him to Kellino . But as Houlinan often said , " Kellino 's rejects are worth picking up options on . " Malomar said with the first pleasure he had felt that day , " Forget about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of picture . " Houlinan looked at him thoughtfully . " How about doing a little private promoting with some of the more important critics ? You have a couple of big ones that owe you a favor . " Malomar said dryly , " I 'm not wasting it on this . " He did n't say that he was going to call in all his IOU 's on the big picture next year . He already had that one mapped out , and Houlinan was not going to run that show . He wanted the next picture to be the star , not Kellino.  |p313Houlinan  looked at him thoughtfully . Then said , " I guess I 'll have to build my own campaign . " Malomar said wearily , " Just remember it 's still a Malomar Films ' production . Clear everything with me . OK ? " " Of course , " Houlinan said with his special emphasis as if it had never occurred to him to do anything else . Malomar said evenly , " Jack , remember there 's a line you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Houlinan said with his dazzling smile , " I never forget that . Have I ever forgotten that ? Listen , there 's a great looking broad from Belgium . I got her stashed in the Beverly Hills Hotel bungalow . Shall we have a breakfast conference tomorrow ? " " Another time , " Malomar said . He was tired of women flying in from all over the world to be fucked . He was tired of all the slender , beautiful , chiseled faces , the thin , elegant bodies perfectly dressed , the beauties he was constantly photographed with at parties and restaurants and premieres . He was famous not only as the most talented producer in Hollywood , but as the one who had the most beautiful women . Only his closest friends knew he preferred sex with plump Mexican maids who worked in his mansion . When they kidded him about his perverseness , Malomar always told them that his favorite relaxation was going down on a woman and that those beautiful women in the magazines had nothing to go down on but bone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not that all this was always true ; it was just that Malomar , knowing how elegant he looked , wanted to show his distaste for that elegance . At this time in his life all Malomar wanted to do was make a good movie . The happiest hours for him were after dinner when he went into the cutting room and worked until the early-morning hours editing a new film . As Malomar ushered Houlinan out of the door , his secretary murmured that the writer of the novel was waiting with his agent , Doran Rudd . Malomar told her to bring them in . He introduced them to Houlinan . Houlinan gave both men a quick appraisal . Rudd he knew . Sincere , charming , in short a hustler . He was a type . The writerp314also was a type . The naive novelist who comes out to work on his film script , gets dazzled by Hollywood , faked out of his shoes by producers , directors and studio heads and then falls for a starlet and wrecks his life by divorcing his wife of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director in town just for openers . And then gets indignant at the way his half-assed novel gets mutilated on the screen . This one was no different . He was quiet and obviously shy and dressed like a slob . Not fashionable slob , which was the new fad even among producers like Malomar and stars who sought specially patched and faded blue jeans that were exquisitely fitted by top tailors  --  but real slob . And ugly to boot like that fucking French actor who grossed so high in Europe . Well , he , Houlinan , would do his little bit to grind this guy into sausage right now . Houlinan gave the writer , John Merlyn , a big hello and told him that his book was the very best book he had ever read in his life . He had n't read it . Then he stopped at the door and turned around and said to the writer , " Listen , Kellino would love to have his picture taken with you this afternoon . We have a conference with Malomar later , and it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three o'clock ? You should be through here , right ? " Merlyn said OK . Malomar grimaced . He knew Kellino was n't even in town , that he was sunning himself in Palm Springs and would n't arrive until six . Houlinan was going to make Merlyn hang around for a no-show just to teach him where the muscle was in Hollywood . Well , he might as well learn . Malomar , Doran Rudd and Merlyn had a long session on the writing of the movie . Malomar noted that Merlyn seemed reasonableand cooperative rather than the usual pain in the ass . He gave the agent the usual bullshit about bringing in the picture for a million when everybody knew that eventually they 'd have to spend five . It was only when they left that Malomar got his first surprise . He mentioned to Merlyn that he could wait for Kellino in the library . Merlyn looked at his watch and said mildly , " It 's ten after three . I never wait more than ten minutes for anybody , not even my kids . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Writers , " he said . But he often said , " Actors , " in the same tone of voice . And " Directors " and " Producers . " He never said it about actresses because you could n't put down a human being who had to contend with a menstrual cycle and wanting to be an actress both . That made them fucking crazy just for openers . Doran Rudd shrugged . " He does n't even wait for doctors . We both had to take a physical together , and we had ten A.M. appointments . You know doctor 's offices . You got ta wait a few minutes . He told the receptionist , I 'm on time , why is n't the doctor on time ? ' Then he walked out . " Jesus , " Malomar said . He was getting pains in his chest . He went into the bathroom and swallowed an angina pill and then went to take a nap on the couch as his doctor had ordered . One of his secretaries would wake him up when Houlinan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's debut as director . As an actor he is always marvelous ; as a director he is less than competent ; as a philosopher he is pretentious and despicable . This is not to say that Stone Woman is a bad film . It is n't really trashy , merely hollow . " Kellino dominates the screen , we always believe the character he plays , but here the character he plays is a man we do not care about . I-low can we care about a man who throws away his life for an empty-headed doll like Selina Denton whose personality appeals to men satisfied with women whose breasts and rear are extravagantly rounded in the cliche style of male chauvinistic fantasy ? Selina Denton 's acting , her usual wooden-Indian style , insipid face contorted in grimaces of ecstasy , is just plain embarrassing . When will Hollywoodcasting directors learn that the audience is interested in seeing real women on the screen ? An actress like Billie Stroud with her commanding presence , her intelligent and forceful technique , her striking appearance ( she is truly beautiful if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male has idolized since the invention of television ) might have salvaged the film , and itp316is surprising that Kellino , whose acting is so intelligent and intuitive , did not realize this when he was casting . Presumably he has enough clout as star and director and co-producer to call this shot , at least . " The script by Hascom Watts is one of those pseudoliterary exercises that read well on paper but do n't make any sense at all on film . We are expected to feel a sense of tragedy for a man to whom nothing tragic happens , a man who finally commits suicide because his comeback as an actor fails ( everyone fails ) and because an emptyheaded , selfish woman uses her beauty ( all in the eyes of the beholder ) to betray him in the most banal fashion since the heroines of Dumas the Younger . " The counterpoint of Kellino trying to save the world by being on the right side of every social question is good-hearted but essentially fascist in concept . The embattled liberal hero evolves into the fascist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this film is also basically fascist ; they do nothing except manipulate men with their bodies . When they do take part in political movements , they are shown as destroyers of men striving to better the world . Ca n't Hollywood believe for a moment that there is a relationship between men and women in which sex does not play a part ? Ca n't it show just one goddamn time that women have the ' manly ' virtues of a belief in humanity and its terrible struggle to go forward ? Do n't they have the imagination to foresee that women might , just might , love a movie that portrays them as real human beings , rather than those familiar rebellious puppets that break the strings men attach to them ? " Kellino is not a gifted director ; he is less than competent . He places the camera where it should be ; the only trouble is that he never gets the lead out of it . But his acting saves the film from the complete disaster the whoremongering script dooms it to be . Kellino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy the film . The rest of the cast is simply dreadful . It 's not fair to dislike an actor because of his looks , but George Fowles is physically too slimy even for the slimy role he plays here . Selina Denton is too empty-looking even for the empty woman she plays here . It 's not a bad idea sometimes to cast against the role , and maybe that 's what Kellino should have done in this film . But maybe it was n't worth the trouble . The fascist philosophy of the script , its male chauvinistic conception of what constitutes a lovable '  |p317woman  , doomed the whole project before they loaded film into the camera . " " That fucking cunt , " Houlinan said not in anger but with bewilderedhelplessness . " What the fuck does she want from a movie anyway ? And Jesus Christ , why does she keep going on about Billie Stroud being a good-looking broad ? In all my forty years in movies I 've never seen an uglier movie star . It 's beyond me . " Kellino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . We can forget about this movie . " Malomar listened to both of them . A matched pair of pain in the asses . What the hell did it matter what Clara Ford said ? The picture with Kellino as star would make its money back and help pay some studio overhead . That 's all he 'd ever expected from it . And now he had Kellino on the hook for the important picture , from the novel by John Merlyn . And Clara Ford , brilliant as she was , did n't know that Kellino had a backup director doing all the work without credit . The critic was a particular hate of Malomar 's . She spoke with such authority , she wrote so well , she was so influential but she had no idea at all about what went into the making of a movie . She complained about casting . Did n't she know that it depended on whom Kellino was fucking in the major female role and then it depended on who was fucking the casting director for the smaller parts ? Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in power in certain movies ? There were a thousand broads for each bit part and you could fuck half of them without even giving them anything , just letting them read for it and saying you might call them back for another read . And all those flicking directors building up their own private harems , more powerful than the greatest money-makers in the world as far as beautiful , intelligent women were concerned . Not that you even bothered to do that . Even that was too much trouble and not worth it . What amused Malomar was that the critic was the only one who got the unflappable Houlinan upset.  |p318Kellino  was angry about something else . " What the hell does she mean it 's fascist ? I 've been antifascist all my life . " Malomar said tiredly , " She 's just a pain in the ass . She uses the word fascist ' the way we use the word cunt . ' She does n't mean anything by it . " Kellino was mad as hell . " I do n't give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascists and gets away with it . " Houlinan paced up and down the room , almost dipped into Malomar 's box of Monte Cristo cigars , then thought better of it . " That broad is killing us , " he said . " She 's always killing us . And your barring her from previews does n't help , Malomar . " Malomar shrugged . " It 's not supposed to help , I do it for my bile . " They both looked at him curiously . They knew what bile meant but knew it was n't in character for him to say it . Malomar had read it in a script that morning . Houlinan said , " No shit , it 's too late for this picture , but what the hell are we going to do about Clara on the next one ? " Malomar said , " You 're Kellino 's personal press agent , do what you want . Clara 's your baby . " He was hoping to end this conference early . If it had been just Houlinan , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the truly great stars , and his ass had to be kissed with infinite patience and extreme shows of love . Malomar had the rest of the day and evening scheduled for the cutting room . His greatest pleasure . He was one of the greatest film editors in the business and he knew it . And besides , he loved cutting a film so that all the starlet heads dropped on the floor . It was easy to recognize them . The unnecessary close-ups of a pretty girl watching the main action . The director had banged her , and that was his payoff . Malomar in his cutting room chopped her right out unless he liked the director or the one-in-a-million times the shot worked . Jesus , how many broads had put out to see themselvesup there on the screen for one split second , thinking that one split second would send them on the way to fame and fortune . That their beauty and talent would flash out like lightning . Malomar was tired of beautiful women . They were a pain in the ass ,  |p319es|pecially  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't get hooked once in a while . He 'd had his share of disastrous marriages , three , all with actresses . Now he was looking for any broad who was n't hustling him for something . He felt about pretty girls as a lawyer feels hearing his phone ring . It can mean only trouble . " Get one of your secretaries in here , " Kellino said . Malomar rang the buzzer on his desk , and a girl appeared in the door as if by magic . As she better had . Malomar had four secretaries : two guarding the outer door of his offices and another two guarding the inner sanctum door , one on each side like dragons . No matter what disasters happened  --  when Malomar rang his buzzer , somebody appeared . Three years ago the impossible had happened . He had pressed the buzzer and nothing happened . One secretary was having a nervous breakdown in a nearby executive office , and a free-lance producer was curing her with some head . Another had dashed upstairs to accounting to get some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out sick that day . The fourth and last had been overcome with a painful desire to take a leak , and gambled . She established a woman 's record for taking a leak , but it was not enough . In that fatal few seconds Malomar rang his buzzer and four secretaries were not insurance enough . Nobody appeared . All four were fired . Now Kellino dictated a letter to Clara Ford . Malomar admired his style . And knew what he was getting to . He did n't bother to tell Kellino that there was no chance . " Dear Miss Ford , " Kellino dictated . " Only my admiration for your work impels me to write this letter and point out a few areas where I disagree with you in your review of my new film . Please do n't think this is a complaint of any kind . I respect your integrity enough and revere your intelligence too much to voice an idle complaint . I just want to state that the failure of the film , if indeed it is a failure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still think it was a beautifully written script . I think the people who worked with me in the film were very good and handicapped by me as a director . That is all I have to say except that I am still one of your fans and maybe someday we can get together for lunch and a drink and really talk about film and art . I feel that I have a greatp320deal to learn before I direct my next film ( which wo n't be for quite a long time , I assure you ) and what better person to learn from than you ? Sincerely , Kellino . " " It wo n't work , " Malomar said . " Maybe , " Houlinan said . " You 'll have to go after her and fuck her brains out , " Malomar said . " And she 's too smart a broad to fall for your line of bullshit . " Kellino said , " I really admire her . I really want to learn from her . " " Never mind that , " Houlinan almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer . Fuck her brains out . " Malomar suddenly found them both unbearable . " Do n't do it in my office , " he said . " Get out of here and let me work . " They left . He did n't bother to walk them to the door . The next morning in his special suite of offices in Tri-Culture Studios , Houlinan was doing what he liked to do best . He was preparing press releases that would make one of his clients look like God . He had consulted Kellino 's contract to make sure that he had the legal authority to do what he had to do , and then he wrote : TRI-CULTURE STUDIOS &; MALOMAR FILMS PRESENT A MALOMAR-KELLINO PRODUCTION STARRINGUGO KELLINOFAY MEADOWSIN A UGO KELLINO FILM " JOYRIDE " DIRECTED BY BERNARD MALOMAR ... also starring , and then he scribbled a few names very small to indicate the small type . Then he put : " Executive Producers Ugo Kellino and Hagan Cord . " Then : " Produced by Malomar and Kellino . " And then he indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the novel by John Merlyn . " He leaned back in his chair and admired his work . He buzzed his secretary to typep321it up and then asked his secretary to bring in the Kellino obituary file . He loved to look at that file . It was thick with the operations that would be put into effect on Kellino 's death . He and Kellino had worked for a month up in Palm Springs perfecting the plan . Not that Kellino expected to die , but he wanted to make sure that when he did , everybody would know what a great man he had been . There was a thick folder which contained all the names of everybodyhe knew in show business who would be called for quotes upon his death . There was a complete outline on a television tribute . A two-hour special . All his movie star friends would be asked to appear . There were specific clips of film in another folder of Kellino in his best roles to be shown on that special . There was a film clip of him accepting his two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written comedy sketch in which friends of his would poke fun at his aspirations to be a director . There was a list of everybody Kellino had helped so that some of them could tell little anecdotes about how Kellino had rescued them from the depths of despair on condition they never let anyone know . There was a note on those ex-wives who would be approached for a quote and those who would not be . There were plans for one wife in particular : to fly her out of the country to a safari in Africa on the day Kellino died so no one in the media could get in touch with her . There was an ex-President of the United States who had already given his quote . In the file was a recent letter to Clara Ford asking for a contribution to Kellino 's obituary . It was written on the letterhead of the Los Angeles Times and was legitimate but inspired by Houlinan . He had gotten his copy of Clara Ford 's reply but never showed it to Kellino . He read it again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in films , and it 's a pity that he passed away too soon to achieve the greatness that might have been in store for him with the proper role and the proper direc-tion . " Every time that Houlinan read that letter he had to have anotherp322drink . He did n't know whom he hated more , Clara Ford or John Merlyn . Houlinan hated snotty writers on sight , and Merlyn was one of them . Who the fuck was that son of a bitch he could n't wait to have his picture taken with Kellino ? But at least he could fix Merlyn 's wagon , Ford was beyond his reach . He tried getting her fired by organizing a campaign of hate mail from fans , by using all the pressure of Tri-Culture Studios , but she was simply too powerful . He hoped Kellino was having better luck but he would soon know . Kellino had been on a date with her . He 'd taken her to dinner the night before and was sure to call him and report everything that happened.  |p323IN  my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Land of Empidae . An amusing conceit , at least to me , even if a bit condescending . The empid is an insect . The female is cannibalistic , and the act of sex whets her appetite so that in the last moment of the male 's ecstasy he finds himself without a head . But in one of those marvelous evolutionary processes the male empid learned to bring a tiny bit of food wrapped in a web spun from his own body . While the murderous female peels away the web , he mounts her , copulates and makes his getaway . A more highly developed male empid figured out that all he had to do was spin a web around a tiny stone or pebble , any little bit of junk . In a great evolutionary jump the male empid fly became a I lollywood producer . When I mentioned this to Malomar , he grimacedand gave me a dirty look ; then he laughed . " OK , " he said , " do you want to get your fucking head bit off for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met struck me as a person who would cat off somebody 's foot to become successful . And yet , as I stayed on , I was struck by the passion of people involved in filmmaking . They really loved it . Script girls , secretaries , studio accountants , cameramen , propmen , the technical crews , the actors and actresses ,  |p324the  directors and even the producers . They all said " the movie I made . " They all considered themselves artists . I noticed that the only ones concerned with films that did not speak this way were usually screenwriters . Maybe that was because everyone rewrote their scripts . Everybody put his fucking two cents in . Even the script girl would change a line or two , or a character actor 's wife would rewrite her husband 's part , and he 'd bring it in the next day and say that was the way he thought it should be played . Naturally the rewrite showed off his talents rather than forwarded the movie 's purpose . It was an irritating business for a writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moviemaking is a dilettante art form to an extreme degree and this innocently enough because the medium itself is so powerful . By using a combination of photographs , costumes , music and a simple story line , people with absolutely no talent could actually create works of art . But maybe that was going too far . They could at least produce something good enough to give themselves a sense of importance , some value . Movies can give you great pleasure and move you emotionally . But they can teach you very little . They could n't plumb the depths of a character the way a novel could . They could n't teach you as books could teach you . They could only make you feel ; they could not make you understand life . Film is so magical it can give some value to almost anything . For many people it could be a form of drug , a harmless cocaine . For others it could be a form of valuable therapy . Who does n't want to record his past life or future traits as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself ? Anyway , that was as close as I could figure the movie world out , at that time . Later on , bitten a little by the bug myself , I felt that it was maybe a too cruel and snobbish view . I wondered about the powerful hold making films seemed to have on everyone . Malornar passionately loved making films . All the people who worked in films struggled to control them . The directors , the stars , the chief photographers , the studio wheels . I was aware that cinema was the most vital art of our time , and I was jealous . On every college campus students , instead of writing novels , were making their own films . And suddenly it occurred to me that maybe the use of film was not even an art . That it was ap325form of therapy . Everyone wanted to tell his own life story , his own emotions , his own thoughts . Yet how many books had been published for that reason ? But the magic was not that strong in books or painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be irresistible . With that powerful arsenal of weapons it should be impossible to make a bad movie . You could be the biggest asshole in the world and still make an interesting film . No wonder there was so much nepotism in moviemaking . You literally could let a nephew write a screenplay , take a girlfriend and make her a star , make your son the head of a studio . Movies could make a successful artist out of anyone . Mute Miltons no longer . And how come no actor had ever murdered a director or a producer ? Certainly over the years there had been plenty of cause , financial and artistic . How come a director had never murdered the head of a studio ? How come a writer had never murdered a director ? It must be that the making of a film purged people of violence , was therapeutic . Could it be that someday one of the most effective treatments for the emotionally disturbed would be to let them make their own motion pictures ? Christ , think of all the professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Actors and actresses were certifiable certainly . So that would be it . In the future everybody would stay home and watch films his friends made to keep from going crazy . The films would save his life . Think of it that way . And finally every asshole could be an artist . Certainly , if the people in this business could turn out good pictures , anybody could . Here you had bankers , garment makers , lawyers , etc. , deciding what movies would be made . They did n't even have that craziness which might help create art . So what would be lost if every asshole made a film ? The only problem was to get the cost down . You would n't need psychiatristsanymore or talent . Everybody could be an artist . All those people , unlovable , never understood you had to work at being loved , yet despite their narcissism , infantilism , their selflove , they could now project their internal image of themselves to a lovable exterior on the screen . Make themselves lovable as shadows . Without having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could say that all artists do that ; think of the image of the great writer asp326a self-indulgent prick in his personal life , Osano . But at least they had to have some gift , some talent in their art that gave pleasure or learning or deeper understanding . But with film everything was possible without talent , without any gift . You could get a really rich prick making the story of his life , and without the help of a great director , great writer , great star , etc. , etc. , just with the magic of film make himself a hero . The great future of film for all these people was that it could work with no talent , which did n't mean that talent could not make it better . Because we were working so closely on the script , Malomar and I spent a lot of time together , sometimes late at night in his movie mogul home where I felt uncomfortable . It was too much for one person , I thought . The huge , heavily furnished rooms , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that held the screening . room . One night he offered to screen a new movie , and I told him I was n't that crazy about movies . I guess my snottiness showed because he got a little pissed off . " You know we 'd be doing a lot better on this script if you did n't have such contempt for the movie business , " he said . That stung me a little . For one thing I prided myself that my manners were too good to show such a thing . For another I had a professional pride in my work and he was telling me I was fucking off . For still another I had come to respect Malomar . He was the producer-director and he could have ridden right over me while we were working together , but he never did . And when he made a suggestion to change the script , he was usually right . When he was wrong and I could prove it by argument , he deferred to me . In short , he did not fit all my preconceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching the movie or working on the script , we fought that night . I told him how I felt about the movie business and the people in it . The more I talked , the less angry Malomar became , and finally he was smiling . " You talk like some cunt who ca n't get guys anymore , " Malomar said . " Movies are the new art form , you worry your racket is becoming obsolete . You 're just jealous . "  | " Movies ca n't compare with novels , " I said . " Movies can never do what books do . " " That 's irrelevant , " Malomar said . " Movies are what people want now and in the future . And all your bullshit about producers and the empid fly . You came here for a few months and you pass judgment on everybody . You put us all down . But every business is the same , they all wave that carrot on a stick . Sure , movie people are fucking crazy , sure , they hustle , sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? What you ignore is , all of them , producers and writers , directors and actors , go through a lot of pain . They study their trade or craft for years and work harder than any people I know . They are truly dedicated , and no matter what you say , it takes talent and even genius to make a good movie . Those actors and actresses are like the fucking infantry . They get killed . And they do n't get the important roles by fucking . They have to be proven artists , they have to know their craft . Sure there are assholes and maniacs in this business that ruin a five-million-dollar picture by casting their boyfriend or girlfriend . But they do n't last long . And then you go on about producers and directors . Well , directors I do n't have to defend . It 's the toughest job in the business . But producers have a function too . They 're like lion tamers in a zoo . You know what it is to make a picture ? First you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a studio . Then you have to be mother and father to some crazy fucking stars . You have to keep the crews happy or they murder you with malingering and overtime . And then you have to keep them all from murdering each other . Look , I hate Moses Wartberg , but I recognize that he has a financial genius that helps keep the movie business going . I respect that genius as much as I despise his artistic taste . And I have to fight him all the time as a producer and a director . And I think even you will admit that a couple of my movies could be called art . " " That 's at least half bullshit , " I said . Malomar said , " You keep putting down producers . Well , they are the guys who get pictures together . And they do it by spending two years kissing a hundred different babies , financial babies , actor babies , director babies , writer babies . And producers have to changep328their diapers , get tons of shit up their nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have such lousy taste . And yet a lot of them believe in art more than the talent . Or in its fantasy . You never see a producer not appear at the Academy Awards to pick up his Oscar . " " That 's just ego , " I said , " not a belief in art . " " You and your fucking art , " Malomar said . " Sure , only one movie out of a hundred is worth something , but what about books ? " " Books have a different function , " I said defensively . " Movies can only show the outside . " Malomar shrugged . " You really are a pain in the ass . " " Movies are not art , " I said . " It 's magic tricks for kids . " I only half believed that . Malomar sighed . " Maybe you have the right idea . In every form , it 's all magic , not art . It 's a fake-out so that people forget about dying . " That was n't true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble since his heart attack and I did n't want to say that this was what influenced him . For my money it was art that made you understand how to live . Well , OK , he did n't convince me , but after that I did look around me in a less prejudiced way . But he was right in one thing . I was jealous of the movies . The work was so easy , the rewards so rich , the fame dizzying . I hated the idea of going back to writing novels alone in a room . Underneath all my contempt was a childish envy . It was something I could never really be a part of ; I did n't have the talent or the temperament . I would always in some way despise it but for reasons more snobbish than moral . I had read all about Hollywood , and by Hollywood I really mean the movie business . I had heard writers , especially Osano , come back East and curse the studios , call the producers the worst cocksucking meddlers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this side of the apes , the studios so crooked , overbearingand criminal that they made the Black Hand look like the Sweet Sisters of Charity . Well , how they came back from Hollywood , that 's how I went in . I had all the confidence in the world that I could handle it . When Doran took me into my first meeting with Malomar andp329Houlinan , I spotted them right away . Houlinan was easy . But Malomar was more complicated than I expected . Doran , of course , was a caricature . But to tell the truth I liked Doran and Malomar . I detested Houlinan on sight . And when Houlinan told me to have my picture taken with Kellino , I almost told him to go fuck himself . When Kellino did n't show up on time , I had my out . I hate waiting for anybody . I do n't get mad at them for being late , so why should they get mad at me for not waiting ? What made Hollywood fascinating was all the difference species of empid fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under their arms , scripts and cocaine in their studio apartments , hoping to make movies , searching for talented young girls and guys to read for parts and fuck to pass time . Then there were the bona fide producers with offices on the studio lots and a secretary , plus a hundred thousand dollars in development money . They called agents and casting agencies to send people over . These producers had at least one picture to their credit . Usually a low-budget dumb picture that never made back the cost of the negative and wound up being shown on airplanes or at drive-ins . These producers paid off a California weekly for a quote that called their film one of the ten best pictures of the year . Or a planted Variety report that the picture had outgrossed Gone with the Wind in Uganda , which really meant Gone with the Wind had never played there . These producersusually had signed pictures of big stars on their desks inscribed with " LOVE . " They spent the day interviewing beautiful , struggling actresses who were deadly serious about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was just a way to kill an afternoon and maybe get lucky with a blow job that would give them a better appetite for dinner . If they were really hot for a particular actress , they would take her for lunch in the studio commissary and introduce her to the heavyweights who went by . The heavyweights , having gone through the same routine in their salad days , stood still for this if you did n't push it too far . The heavyweights had outgrown this kid stuff . They were too busy unless the girl was something special . Then she might get a shot . The girls and boys knew the game , knew it was partly a fixedp330wheel , but they also knew that you could get lucky . So they took their chances with a producer , a director , a star , but if they really knew their stuff and had some brains , they would never pin their hopes on a writer . I realized now how Osano must have felt . But again I always understood this was part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the flattery and heady atmosphere of studio conferences and the feeling of importance in making a big film . So I never really got hooked . If I got a little horny , I flew to Vegas and gambled it cold . Cully would always try to send a class hooker to my room . But I always refused . Not that I was priggish , and of course , I was tempted . But I liked gambling more and had too much guilt . I spent two weeks in Hollywood playing tennis , going out to dinner with Doran and Malomar , going to parties . The parties were interesting . At one I met a faded star who had been my masturbationfantasy when I was a teenager . She must have been fifty , but she still looked pretty good with face-lifts and all kinds of beauty aids . But she was just a little fat and her face was puffy with alcohol . She got drunk and tried to fuck every male and female at the party but could n't find a taker . And this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . I found that sort of interesting . I guess the truth is that it depressed me too . The parties were OK . Familiar faces of actors and actresses . Agents brimming over with confidence . Charming producers , forceful directors . I have to say they were a hell of a lot more charming and interesting than I ever was at a party . And then I loved the balmy climate . I loved the palm tree streets of Beverly Hills , and I loved goofing around Westwood with all its movie theaters and young college kids who were film afficionados with really great-looking girls . I understood why all those 1930 novelists had " sold out . " Why spend five years writing a novel that made two grand when you could live this life and make the same money in a week ? During the day I would work in my office , have conferences on the script with Malomar , lunch in the commissary , wander over to a set and watch a picture being shot . On the set the intensity of the actors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really awed . A young couple played a scene in which the boy murderedp331his girlfriend while they made love . After the scene the two of them fell into each other 's arms and wept as if they had been part of a real tragedy . They walked off the set hugging each other . Lunch at the commissary was fun . You met all the people acting in films , and it seemed as if everybody had read my book , at least they said they did . I was surprised that actors and actresses really did n't talk much . They were good listeners . Producers talked a lot . Directors were preoccupied , usually accompanied by three or four assistants . The crew seemed to have the best time . But to watch the shooting of a picture was boring . It was n't a bad life , but I missed New York . I missed Valerie and the kids , and I missed my dinners with Osano . Those were nights I 'd hop a plane to Vegas for the evening , sleep over and come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studio , after I had been back and forth a few times , NY to LA , LA to NY , Doran asked me to come to a party at his rented house in Malibu . A goodwill party where movie critics , scriptwriters and production people mixed it up with actors and actresses and directors . I did n't have anything better to do , I did n't feel like going to Vegas , so I went to Doran 's party , and there I met Janelle for the first time.  |p333IT  was one of those Sunday informal gatherings thrown in a Malibu house that had a tennis court plus a big Jacuzzi pool , with steaming hot water . The house was divided from the ocean by only a thin strip of sand . Everybody was dressed casually . I noticed that most of the men threw their car keys on the table in the first receiving room , and when I asked Eddie Lancer about that , he told me that in Los Angeles male trousers were tailored so perfectly that you could n't put anything into your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard interesting conversations . A tall , thin , aggressive-looking dark woman was falling all over a handsome producer type wearing a yachting cap . A very short little blonde rushed up to them and said to the woman , " Lay another hand on my husband and I 'll punch you right in the cunt . " The man in the yachting cap had a stutter and very deadpan said , " Th-th-that 's OK . She does n't use it mu-u-u-ch anyway . " Going through a bedroom , I saw a couple head to toe and I heard a woman 's very schoolmarm voice say , " Get up here . " I heard a guy I recognized as a New York novelist saying , " The movie business . If you make a reputation as a great dentist , they 'll let you do brain surgery . " And I thought , another pissed-off writer . I wandered out into the parking area near the Pacific Coastp334Highway and I saw Doran with a group of friends admiring a Stutz Bearcat . Somebody had just told Doran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For that kind of money it should be able to give head . " And everybody laughed . Then Doran said , " How do you get the nerve to just park it ? It 's like having a night job while being married to Marilyn Monroe . " I really went to the party just to meet Clara Ford , for my money the best American film reviewer who ever lived . She was smart as hell , wrote great sentences , read a lot of books , saw every movie and agreed with me on ninety-nine films out of a hundred . When she praised a film , I knew I could go see it and probably love it , or at the very least would be able to sit through the damn thing . Her reviews were the closest a critic could come to being an artist , and I liked the fact that she never claimed to be creative . She was content to be a critic . At the party I did n't get much chance to talk to her , which was OK with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady she really was . She came with Kellino , and he kept her busy . And since most of the people clustered around Kellino , Clara Ford got a lot of attention . So I sat in the corner and just watched . Clara Ford was one of those small , sweet-looking women who are usually called plain , but her face was so alive with intelligence that , in my eyes anyway , she was beautiful . What made her fascinating was that she could be both tough and innocent at the same time . She was tough enough to take on all the other major movie critics in New York and show them up as top-notch assholes . She did it A-B-C , like a prosecuting DA with an airtight case . She showed up as an idiot one guy whose humorous Sunday columns on movies were embarrassing . She took on the voice of the Greenwich Village avant-garde movie buffs and showed him for the dull bastard he was , yet she was smart enough to see him as an idiot savant , the dumbest guy who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain movies . By the time she was through she had all their balls in her unfashionable J. C. Penney handbag . I could see she was having a good time at the party . And that she was aware that Kellino was conning her with his romancing . Through the uproar I could hear Kellino say , " An agent is an idiot savant manque . " That was an old trick of his with critics , male andp335female . In fact , he had scored a great success with an astringent male critic by calling another critic a fag manque . Now Kellino was being so fucking charming with Clara Ford that it was a scene in a movie . Kellino showed his dimples like muscles and Clara Ford , for all her intelligence , was beginning to wilt and hang on to him a little . Suddenly a voice next to me said , " Do you think Kellino will let her fuck him on the first date ? " The voice came from a really good-looking blond girl , or rather a woman because she was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like Clara Ford , what gave her face some of its beauty was its intelligence . She had great sharp-planed bones in her face with lovely white skin over those bones , you could n't notice the skin owed something to makeup . She had vulnerable brown eyes that could be delighted as a child 's and tragic as a Dumas heroine . If this sounds like a lover 's description out of Dumas , that 's OK . Maybe I did n't feel this way when I first saw her . That came later . Right now the brown eyes looked mischievous . She was having a good time standing outside the party storm center . What she had , which was unusual in beautiful women , was the delighted , happy air that children have when they are being left alone , doing what is to them amusing . I introduced myself and she said her name was Janelle Lambert . I recognized her now . I 'd seen her in small parts in different movies and she 'd always been good . She gave her part second effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never thought of her as great . I could see she admired Clara Ford and had hoped the critic would say something to her . She had n't , so now Janelle was being funny malicious . In another woman it would have been a catty remark about Ford , but with her it was OK . She knew who I was and said the usual things about the book that people say . And I put on my usual absentminded act as if I had barely heard the compliment . I liked the way she dressed , modest , yet stylish as hell without being high fashion . " Let 's go over , " she said . I thought she wanted to meet Kellino , but when we got there , I saw her trying to get Clara Ford into a conversation . She said intelligent things , but you could see Fordp336putting the ice on her because she was so beautiful , or so I thought then . Suddenly Janelle turned and walked away from the group . I followed her . She had her back to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found that she was crying . Her eyes were magnificent with tears in them . They were golden brown flecked with black dots that were maybe just darker brown ( later I found out they were contact lenses ) , and the tears made the eyes bigger , with more gold . They also betrayed the fact that she 'd given the eyes a little help with makeup that was now running . " You 're beautiful when you cry , " I said . I was imitating Kellino in one of his charming roles . " Oh , fuck you , Kellino , " she said . I hate women using words like " fuck " and " cunt " and " motherfucker . " But she was the only woman I ever heard who made the word " fuck " sound humorous and friendly . The f and the k were Southern slurry soft . Maybe it was obvious that she had never said the word until lately . Maybe it was because she grinned at me to let me know she knew I was imitating Kellino . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't know why I 'm so silly , " she said . " But I never go to parties . I just came because I knew she 'd be here . I admire her so much . " " She 's a good critic , " I said . " Oh , she 's so smart , " Janelle said . " She once wrote something nice about me . And you know , I thought she 'd like me . Then she put me down . For no reason . " " She had plenty of reason , " I said . " You 're beautiful and she 's not . And she 's got plans for Kellino tonight , and she was not going to have him distracted by you . " " That 's silly , " she said . " I do n't like actors . " " But you 're beautiful , " I said . " Also , you were talking intelligently . She has to hate you . " For the first time she looked at me with something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I liked her because she was beautiful . I liked her because she never went to parties . I liked her because she did n't go for actors like Kellino , who were so goddamnp337handsome and charming and dressed so beautifully in exquisitely tailored suits , with haircut by a scissored Rodin . And because she was intelligent . Also , she could cry over a critic putting her down at a party . If she was that tenderhearted , maybe she would n't kill me . It was the vulnerability finally that made me ask her to have dinner and a movie . I did n't know what Osano could have told me . A vulnerable woman will kill you all the time . The funny thing is , I did n't see her sexually . I just liked her a hell of a lot . Because despite the fact that she was beautiful and had that wonderfully happy grin even with tears , she was not really a sexy woman at first glance . Or I was too inexperienced to notice . Because later , when Osano met her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exposed electric wire . When I told Janelle about Osano , she said that must have happened to her after I met her . Because before she met me , she had been off sex . When I kidded her about that and did n't believe her , she gave me that happy grin and asked if I had ever heard about vibrators . It 's funny that a grown woman telling you that she masturbated with a vibrator can turn you on to her . But it 's easy to figure out . The implication is that she is not promiscuous , though she is beautiful and lives in a milieu where men are after women as quickly as a cat after a mouse and mostly for the same reason . We went out with each other for two weeks , about five times , before we finally got to bed . And maybe we had a better time before we slept together than we did afterward . I would go to work at the studio during the day and work on the script and have some drinks with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beverly Hills Hotel and read . Sometimes I 'd go to a movie . On the nights I 'd have a date with Janelle she 'd meet me at the suite , and then she would drive me around to the movies and a restaurant and then back to the suite . We 'd have a few drinks and talk , and she 'd go home about one in the morning . We were buddies , not lovers . She told me why she divorced her husband . When she was pregnant , she 'd been horny as hell , but he did n't care for her pregnant . Then when the baby came , she 'd loved nursing it . She was delighted by the milk flowing from her breast and the
