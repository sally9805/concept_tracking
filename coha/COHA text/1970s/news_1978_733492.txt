txt The United Mine Workers ' two-month-old strike is daily squeezing coal supplies tighter across the Midwest . Some states ? notably Indiana , Kentucky , Ohio ? are at the brink of mandatory coal-rationing decisions . Big industrial customers of the coal-fired electric utilities would bear the main brunt of the cutbacks . But otherwise , across the heavily industrial North Central tier of states from Minnesota to Pennsylvania , state energy and public utility officials report a bit of breathing room before any crisis sets in . Throughout the Midwest , state officials report a continued flow of coal for'residences , schools , or similar critical users . ( Bargainers for the UMW and the Bituminous Coal Operators Association reached a tentative agreement in Washington that could be formalized soon , United Press International reported Feb. 9 . But the miners still must approve any agreement reached and that prospect is uncertain . ) " We are in trouble , " says Vince Griffin , director of the Indiana Energy Office policy division . Some utilities are down to a 20-day coal supply . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 percent coal-use cut won little response . An Indiana coal summit conference this weekend will consider mandatory cutbacks and a shifrof coal reserves to beleaguered utilities , regardless of UMA strike settlement progress , Indiana officials say // From page . ; 1 Coal-short Midwest digs in ; worst-hit states weigh rationing One Indiana community , Logansport , ran down to a two-day coal supply at the city 's generating plant . Logansport closed buSiness and schools and barely got by until emergency supplies arrived . Kentucky 's energy director , Damon Harrison , says utilities in his state could begin trimming power for industrial customers as early as next week , while other utilities can likely hold off curtailments until late in March . " Utility coal reserves range from 40-to 80-or 85-day supplies in Kentucky , " he says . " A couple of weeks of sub-zero weather " could hasten the curtailment pace , he indicates . " There is no cause for panic , " Mr. Harrison says , " but the situation is a lot more serious than department of energy coal reserve figures for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOE ) estimated Kentucky 's utility reserves at 84 days at the end of January , considerably above the state 's own estimate then of 55 days . " If Carter and Energy Secretary James R. Schlesinger are basing national action on a spread that great , we 're in trouble . " Similarly , Indiana officials complain the DOE overestimated its average utility coal supplies by three weeks . Michigan says its supplies are more than a month short of federal estimates . Ohio reports a 50-day coal supply average for its utilities . Lingering uncertainty over a UMW strike pact ratification is making it hard for Ohio officials to bite the bullet and approve forced coal-use cuts or power curtailments .

Michigan , on Feb. 1 , approved a costly " uneconomic burn " program for its two big utilities ? switching from coal to oil and gas for power generation , at an added expense to consumers of $14 million a month . " Each month of the fuel-switch program buys an extra week for our coal stocks , " says Roger Fisher , Michigan Public Service Commission spokesman . Minnesota and Wisconsin are among the most coal-comfortable Midwest states . Both rely heavily on Western coal , not affected by the Dec. 6 Eastern mine shutdown . Illinois 's lowest utility stockpile is expected to last another 40 days , says Illinois Energy Division spokesman William Poulakos . The state is shifting from coal to oil where possible or switching power generation to more fuel-efficient plants .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
