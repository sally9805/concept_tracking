Retort some whites : " Save a fish-spear an Indian " <P> The whites who live on the White Earth reservation in northwestern Minnesota are increasingly apprehensive about their Indian neighbors . Says Jane Reish , co-owner of the Jolly Fisherman Resort : " We 're not just a little bit nervous , we 're scared to death . We seem to be caught in a time warp . All this talk about the Treaty of 1867 . This is 1979 ! " <P> It is indeed 1979 , but Indians all over the U.S. are on the warpath against whites-and winning . Brandishing legal briefs , the Indians are asserting their rights under old treaties and insisting on control over activities on their reservations . <P> This push marks still another turn in Indian militancy . The celebrated cases in which Indian tribes claimed ownership of huge tracts of land now seem headed for compromises . In Maine the Penobscots and Passamaquoddies , who once demanded 12 million acres , or two-thirds of the state , have come down to 300,000 acres , and may well settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land and resources are used have multiplied startlingly ; there now are an estimated 7,000 claims in 30 states . <P> The bitterest disputes have turned out to be over hunting and fishing . Two precedent-setting battles are taking place on reservations in Michigan and Minnesota that were visited by TIME Correspondent Madeleine Nash . Her report : <P> In Michigan 's Upper Peninsula , which separates Lake Superior from lakes Michigan and Huron , there are bumper stickers that exhort : SAVE A FISH-SPEAR AN INDIAN . Whites have fired shots at Chippewa fishermen , smashed their boats and slashed their tires . The confrontation intensified last spring after Federal Judge Noel Fox ruled that , under treaties signed in 1836 and 1855 , the state could not regulate fishing by Indians . Said Fox : " The fish belong to the Indians as a matter of right . " Since then , many Chippewas on the poverty-battered Bay Mills reservation have become full-time commercial fishermen . At 6 on a late autumn evening , during the prime fishing season , almost all of them are on the move to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; by morning a successful fisherman will have hauled up to half a ton of silvery whitefish , worth about $800 , into his 25-ft. boat . On other nights , of course , the catch is much less . The average Indian fisherman earns about $10,000 a year . <P> What infuriates the whites is that the Chippewas use gill nets , which are wide-mesh devices that also trap and kill lake trout and coho salmon . Both are among the game fish that Michigan spends $1.6 million a year to stock in its waters . Whites fear that Chippewa gill netters will clean out the trout and cohos , and destroy the state 's $350 million-a-year sport-fishing industry . Myrl Keller , a state fish biologist , calls the Indians ' use of the nets a " malicious , wasteful mode of fishing . " <P> The state , which has appealed Fox 's decision , wants the Indians to use cage-like trap nets , which do not kill the fish , and to return the game fish to the water .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
