txt A black candidate for the vice-presidency of the United States ? " Not electable now , " says Sen. Edmund S. Muskie , of Maine , the leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination . " We both would lose , " he is quoted as saying in effect . " It is a libel on the American people to suggest . . . they would vote against a man because of his religion or his race or his color , " counters President Nixon , who feels one term deserves another . In this quick exchange is the making of an issue with a cutting edge . It could help slice down the rangy Senator in the Democratic primaries and deny him an opportunity to get in the same ring with Mr. Nixon . At the very least , Mr. Muskie will have to scramble to recover lost ground . // *Black vice-president academic ? // The danger to Mr. Muskie may not be so much alienation of black and liberal voters . They may ultimately conclude they have no other place to go . White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Threat to an image The threat is to an image of idealism . Is winning office for himself more important than principled willingness to run with any well-qualified man regardless of his race or religion ? Political cynics will say correctly that every presidential candidate picks a running mate with his own self-interest at heart . There was also the time when the Democrats nominated Alfred E. Smith for the presidency in 1928 , regardless of prejudice against Roman Catholics . President John F. Kennedy broke down that barrier in 1960 at Mr. Nixon 's expense . Mr. Muskie 's nomination as vice-presidential candidate in 1968 was a repeat performance . The American scene as it affects the black aspirant for office is changing rapidly , too . More black candidates were successful in 1970 than at any time since Reconstruction days following the Civil War 1,769 tally in 1970 Figures of the Metropolitian Applied Reseach Center , Inc. , and the Joint Center for Political Studies show that 1,769 blacks held political office in 1970 . Congress has 13 blacks in the House and a thriving black caucus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger contigent of blacks is expected after the 1972 elections The power of the blacks in big cities multiplies each year . Six cities , Atlanta , Washington , Newark , N.J. ; Gary , Ind. ; Compton , Calif. ; and East St. Louis , Ill. , have a majority of blacks . As never before in American history , the blacks are becoming conscious of the advantages that come with block voting . There will have to be a first time for nomination of a black , a Jew , a woman for the higher offices . And not everyone would agree with Mr. Muskie that a black could not be elected vice-president today . Sen. Edward W. Brooke of Massachusetts has been mentioned as possible Republican vice-presidential - candidate on a 1972 Nixon ticket . . The argument has been made by many that in the secrecy of the polls , only the candidate for the presidency counts . Effects of debate seen good The debate resulting from Mr. Muskie 's statements could , as Mr. Muskie says , be healthy and hasten the day when the color line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems unlikely to get credit for starting the debate . Comments that he has been " frank and candid " could be overshadowed by questions about his political principles . The outlook is that Senator Muskie may find himself having to say much more to explain his full views , even to consider admitting that he was wrong to rule out a black running mate next year . When Mr. Muskie first gave his opinion on a black running mate , on Sept. 7 , to representatives of the black community of Watts ( Los Angeles ) , it looked as if the political repercussions could be minimal After all , Muskie supporters argued quickly , he was only being realistic . There was no large outcry from the black community . Expansion on the theme Roosevelt Grier , onetime football great and political activist for Kennedy-type liberalism , appeared with Mr. Muskie the following day Do you agree with Mr. Muskie ? he was asked . " I sure do " Los Angeles City Councilman Thomas Bradley issued a clarifying statement the same day . He reported that Mr. Muskie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I run , it will be for the purpose of winning in order that I may do something about the problems affecting black people and others in this country . I think that in view of the climate in the country today , that if a black man were on ticket that we would both lose . " There are many highly qualified blacks in this country who are capable of holding any office , but . I am talking about political and practical realities at this time , " the Senator was quoted as saying . Though Mr. Bradley said he disagreed , he praised Mr. Muskie for what he called " candor and honesty " and for " a fresh breath of air " on the political scene . GOP weekly pounces " I 'm not going to rule anybody off the ticket on the basis of race or sex , " says Sen. George McGovern of South Dakota , who is looking for issues to shave Mr. Muskie 's big lead for the Democratic nomination . The Sept. 13 issue of Monday , the live-wire Republican weekly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muskie can blandly tell a group of black leaders , ' Be patient , fellows , your time has not yet come . Somebody will break the color barrier on a national ticket one day , but not me  --  putting a black on the ticket might cost me some votes . ' " ' Somebody else , in some future year , is going to have to be the first person on the block to greet the new black neighbors , ' Ed Muskie is saying , ' but not me . ' Nixon answers Despite his announced resolution not to comment on politics , Mr Nixon could n't resist the opening . " Only 2 percent of the people of Massachusetts are of the same race as Ed Brooke , yet he won overwhelmingly for attorney general and for the United States Senate , and he is going to win a landslide victory this year , . . . " Mr. Nixon said . " I think it is very important for those of us in positions of leadership not to tell a large number of people in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their birth they do n't have a chance to go to the top . " For those blacks who distrust the record of the Nixon administration on housing and segregation , this comment may fall on deaf ears Yet , Mr. Nixon places himself closer to the " politics of hope " that Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey ( D ) of Minnesota espoused in 1968 than has Mr Muskie on this issue .
