" If you 're in trouble , if someone ! sakes you to be a cop , take off your shirt , " says Ed . " We 'll get you out of there .

The strategy set , Ed drives off for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surveillance car , then Ralph and Tim in a late-model sports car . ? ? ? IT IS A HOT , muggy afternoon , and Wampum Lake Is jammed . Hundreds of kids are moving in and out of the parking lot . Even to the most casual observer , it appears that a lot of drugs are being bought and sold . There is excitement in the air . Like a procession entering a popular drive-in restaurant , cars , vans , trucks , and motorcycles arrive in a continual flow , most of them evidently there to pick up dr42. home stay , others drive off after purchases are made . " Acid ! Coke ! Acid ! Coke ! " The words are yelled at the slowly passing vehicles by young men and women standing beside the parking lot . On one picnic table , hurdieds of green capsules are spread out , c , uickly counted into batches , and sold on the spot . No forest rangers , no police , no law is anywhere in sight . It is 3 p.m. , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buyers . ? ? ? AS ED PULLS into the Wampum Luke parking lot , Ise amd his passenger , a reporter , raise beer cans in salute to the groups of young people . " Acid ! Coker shouts a girl seated on the rear bumper of a car . " We just busted kids for dope possession here a week ago , but you can see it did n't scare off too many others , " Ed says . By the time Ralph and Tim arrive and park their sports car in the row of angle-parkers near the entrance , Ed has picked a spot from which to oversee the operation and the surveillance car is cruising nearby . RALPH AND TIM begin to circulate among motorcyclists , past two girls carrying babies , and into a group of more than a dozen young men and women congregating around a quarter-barrel of beer that is on ice under an oak tree . The surveillance car moves into position for a better view of what transpires under the tree . Ralph makes a buy . From the surveillance car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After allowing Ralph and Tim time to drift away from the group at the tree and mix with others , the rangers pull into the parking lot in their yellow squad car and prepare to make an arrest . ? ? ? MOST OF THE kids spot the ranger ear immediately , but they eye it with no outward signs of concern . Youths ranging in age from 15 to 25 cluster around a large oak tree about 75 feet front the parking lot . Many come : Old go , making drug purchases , then leaving . Others arrive . " I never seen so many rangers , man , " says one youth near the oak tree as he sees two more ranger cars arrive . " Maybe they need some stuff ' doper another says , and both laugh . They drink beer Mein paper cups , the beer coming from a quarter-barrel on ice in a 50-ga1-lon forest preserve refuse drum .

They seem tutconcerned that two rangers arc less than 100 yards away . The dealers are salter and sharp-eyed , however . They are watching the rangers carefully , as if they sense something is not right . Two rangers leave their car , walk briskly to the oak tree , and order , a hulking man seated at a picnic table to get up . He drops a foil-wrapped package to the ground as they approach , then struggles with them briefly before he is handcuffed and taken away . No one seems surprised . ? ? ? FROM WHERE ED is seated , he can see the rangers and the arrested man coining toward him . Some kids shout , " Quit hassling us . " One makes an ob . scene gesture to the departing rangers . " They think their buddy got busiest for possession , " Ed says . " They do n't even realize we saw the guy making a sale and he 's gut marked money . " During the action under the oak tree , Ralph and Tim have bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the time the rangers drive up to the picnic table to arrest the two women , Ralph and Tan lasso returned to the group under the tree . ? ? ? A DEALER AND buyer simply turn their backs on the rangers who are arresting two women 75 yards away , and the money is again exchanged for drugs . The transaction is conducted with assuredness . The ranger cars leave for another part of the preserve . " Watcha need ? " a blond youth asks a man approaching hint with a few dollars in his hand . " Beer , " replies the loan , a Tribune reporter . " Got any beer to sell ? " " Beer ? Sure , we gut beer , we got anything you want . Want to cop some dope too ? " " Now , just beer . " A GIRL , perhaps It or 17 , walks up and asks for pot . It is like doing business at a vegetable stand , " Pot ? Pot right over here , " says the blond youth . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " IMw much ? " " Thirty-five dollars a lid . Clean stuff . No sticks , okay ? " He tells her to follow him to a dark green van in the parking lot . He opens a side door , reaches in quickly , and hands her a plastic bag of " clean stuff . " BACK AT 771E oak tree , one youth has a new sales pitch : " Come on , man , buy some stuff ? we 're collecting for Bob 's bail . " Everyone laughs . No one seems very upset over the arrests of two or three of their number . " The rangers starriest hint . You ca n't blame them . They warned Bob before , " one says . " He should n't have been carrying all that stuff on him , man . It 's a felony , automatic , all-OH-matic ! " A young woman walks up with a Doberman pinscher . " I 'd love to let him at those rangers , " she says . Everyone applauds . The kids are still watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is happening as arrests are made seemingone ill the group tinder the oak tree yells , " It 's an invasion of privacy . " When the ranger car has gotten about : WO yards away , a hawker resumes chanting , " Acid ! Coke ! Acid ! Coke ! " ? ? ? RALPH AND TIM return to the tree group and find it 's just as easy to buy drugs after the arrests as it haul been earlier . This time , according to the survsillance car , they 've bought from one of the Mexicans the rangers especially wanted . The three-hour " buy and bust " operation ends with Lavenhagen and Lawrence driving their yellow squad right up to the tree , quickly ruresling the Mexirnn , and leaving . All seven policemen then go to the nearby Glenwood police statue to help in honking the five arrested . Two men , 22 ; Ind 21 , and a woman , 19 , are charged with delivery of controlled substances . Another man and woman , Wilt/ slid not make direct hand-to-hand sales , are released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DRUGS bought by Ralph and Tint are identified by Lavenhagen as PC'P ? phencyclidene , or " angel dust " ? and Tuinal. lie reports the arrests 1w telephone to an assistant state 's attorney who is surprised to learn that the ranger has a narcotics testing kit . " That tells you how little reputation we have , " Lavenhagen Tim , who bought the Tuinal , smiles when his partners compliment him on a job well done . ' nat makes me feel good , ' cause I ai n't been here that long , " he says . Assessing the day 's work , he looks at his clean jeans anti cotton shirt and says , " We did n't dress grubby enough . " It 's not long before others at Wampum Lake learn their friends are being honked at the police station and begin drifting over . When they see Tim standing outside , he becomes the target of yet more obscene gestures . " Yeah , well , next time maybe it 'll be you that gets busted , " he responds . gaTns i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOR THE WOMAN who is charged , it gets serious . She starts crying when she learns her car has been searched and towed by police . " What 's going to happen to my car ? " she asks . " It 's only two months old . " When Ralph reminds her that she sold him drugs and he 's a policeman , she sobs , " I was just out there looking for a girlfriend to go shopping . This guy asked lie if I wanted to make some /Homy later , as an older ranger is typing hunt-and-peck style on her arrest report , she asks , " Do you want me to type that ? 1 type 60 words a minute . " Ile stares at her incredulously . " You 're under arrest , " he says . " You ca n't type this . " THEN , AFTER TYPING a few more words , he looks at her , shakes his head , and asks , " You type 60 wards a minute and you 're in here ? Why ? " Cases against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been doing this 10 years , and I can only think of one person arrested for drugs who has gone to jail , " Levenhagen says . " It 's usually a fine and some kind of probation . " A lot of it is frustrating . You psyche yourself up to go out there by saying you 're putting sonic control on drug dealing . " TUESDAY : Unhappy rangers talk about their image , politics , and lack of effectiveness . ly without any pattern . Why are mine arrested and others ignored , one kid wonders aloud . ? ? ? El ) AND HIS companion , older than most of those in the area , are becoming suspect as the arrests continue . Several groups come by and ask , " Are you guys with the cops or with the state 's attorney ? " However , they accept noncommittal responses ? accompanied by glares ? and move on . " Hell , we 're gettin ' all the suspicious looks , " Ed says . " Nobody suspects our two buyers , and nobody notices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the open by the gate for half an hour . " ? ? ? DESPITE THE rangers ' frequent passes , drug sales continue in the parking lot and under the nearby tree . When asked why they do n't do their drug business in the seclusion of the woods , one youth replies , " Hey , there 's mosquitoes in them woods . All you do is attract attention , anyway . " Another youth , evidently amazed by all the ranger activity , decides to go over to a ranger 's car to ask some questions . " He 'll talk to me , he owes me , " the youth says . " One time , he was chasing some dude through the woods and stropped his gun . I found it and gave it back to him . He promised me he 'd never bust me . " After a short conversation , he returns from the rangers ' car and explains : " He says the rangers are having to crack down because of bad publicity lately .
