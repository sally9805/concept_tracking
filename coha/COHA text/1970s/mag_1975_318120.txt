THANK YOU , FOG by W.H. AUDEN 59 pages . Random House . $6 . <P> <P> " A writer gives himself away all the time anyway , " W.H. Auden once pointed out . " He has no important secrets . ' ' Certainly the secrets in this poet 's heart were well known by the time he died two falls ago . Auden 's evolution from anger to acceptance , from wrathful condemnation of prewar society ( " that confabulation of weasels at the next table " ) to rueful contemplation of self , was one of the best articulated literary odysseys ever taken . <P> If there are no secrets in this volume , there are no surprises either . How could there be ? These are the handful of poems that Auden wrote between the time he went back to England after 31 years in the New World and the time of his death . It is the familiar , autumnal Auden speaking : student of fleshly decay , writer of thank-you notes , urbane scold , expert at anamnesis , a celebrator of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ritual . <P> Retransplanted to Britain , the poet praises animals at the expense of men ( " you have never felt the need to become literate ... never kill for applause " ) . He is pleased to encounter again on his native turf that " unsullied sister of Smog , " good old English Fog . In a miniautobiography he offers thanks to helpful friends and models ( among them : Hardy , Dylan Thomas , Frost , Yeats , Brecht , Kierkegaard , Goethe and Horace ) . Plato , however , rates a putdown ( " I ca n't imagine anything/ that I would less like to be/ than a disincarnate Spirit " ) . So do the " nimble technicians " of Detroit ( " Dark was the day when Diesel/ conceived his grim engine " ) , partly because they can not be bothered to build " what sanity knows we need , / an odorless and noiseless/ staid little electric brougham . " <P> Auden liked to quote Paul Valry to the effect that poems are never completed , only abandoned . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the old master has his moments of magic , turning his nouns into verbs and moving more often than not in a seven-syllable line that sounds like simple conversation but conceals much art . In " Nocturne , " though most of the world is asleep , " someone in the small hours , / for the money or love , is/ always awake and at work. / Here young radicals plotting/ to blow up a building , there/ a frowning poet rifling/ his memory 's printer's-pie/ to form some placent sentence . " Then : <P> <P> Over oceans , landmasses and treetops the Moon now takes her dander through the darkness , to lenses a ruined world lying in its own rubbish , but still to the naked eye the Icon of all mothers , for never shall second thoughts succumb our first-hand feelings , our only redeeming charm , our childish drive to wonder : spaced about the firmament , planets and constellations still officiously declare the glory of God , though known to be uninfluential.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
