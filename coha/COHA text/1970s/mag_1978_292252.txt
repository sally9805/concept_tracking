However stormy the Navy 's military and financial future may be , it now enjoys smoother sailing in one important area : morale . Though there are still some problems with drugs , alcoholism and a high desertion rate , the service has recovered smartly from the troubled early 1970s , when a series of violent racial clashes revealed an armed force at war with itself . <P> Today 's vastly improved mood is the result of the determination of Admiral Elmo Zumwalt , Chief of Naval Operations from 1970 to ' 74 , to bring the life of young sailors into line with that of their civilian contemporaries . He radically changed the service 's restrictive dress code by permitting modish haircuts , beards and sideburns and eliminating the requirement for frequent uniform changes during the day . ( This does not apply , however , to the lowly inductee , whose hair is still cropped when he enters bootcamp . ) Zumwalt also revised the duty rotation system and the fleet 's operating schedules to give his men more time at home with their families . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grievances . <P> Many venerable Navy traditions have simply disappeared , reports TIME Correspondent Joseph Kane , after visiting the 170,000-acre naval complex at San Diego , home to 89,200 Navy men and women ( 17% of the entire Navy ) . The grounds of the naval training center now look more like a college campus than a military base , with many sailors sporting blue denims . The hefty pay raises ( a seaman E-3 makes $460 monthly in base pay , compared with $99 in 1958 ) mean that most sailors can afford apartments in San Diego . Petty Officer Third Class Anthony Moseby , 23 , for one , can . This means that each weekday morning he is up near dawn in his beach apartment , dons his jeans , sweater and tennis shoes and drives to the base . Aboard his ship , at the bunk assigned to him , he changes into regulation dungarees and goes to work on the computers in the ship 's data-processing center . <P> A warship docked at the base thus becomes a kind of factory where a sailor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like any civilian worker . Single enlisted men often head for the Scuttle Butt , a lively disco bearing no resemblance to the " slop chute " E.M . clubs that former Navy men knew . The new informality is striking . According to some officers , today 's sailor does not always say " Yes , sir , " but may just as frequently say " Yeah , " and then add , " Have a nice day . " <P> The most extreme of all breaks from tradition is that the service now has 23,356 women in uniform . Some 20 of them are pilots and fly attack planes as well as transport and passenger aircraft . Other Navy women skipper ships . Boatswain 's Mate Juanita Heaster , for instance , is based in Naples , Italy , where she captains a small vessel that ferries supplies out to larger warships . She says she gets " a thrill out of taking a boat out in the rough seas , " but still feels a lack of equality . " The men think that women ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do just as hard a job as the men do . We have to manhandle the supplies and scrape and paint just as a man does . "
