Henry Kissinger once called him " the greatest statesman of our era . " Indeed , few men in the 20th century did more than Chou En-lai to forge the Chinese revolution and to change the shape of international politics . Chou was for a quarter-century the overseer of China 's vast governing bureaucracy . As the chief architect of China 's foreign policy under Chairman Mao Tse-tung , he charted Peking 's course of independence from the two superpowers , creating in the process a new world center of power and influence . Suave , shrewd and enduring , he advanced the cause of China with Metternichian dexterity and a flair for the dramatic gesture . When he died of cancer last week at the age of 77 , Chou left behind him a life of extraordinary achievement as revolutionary , soldier and administrator of the world 's most populous nation . <P> Among the dedicated and often fanatical men who led the Chinese Communist Party , Chou was unique . Mao , though a poet and an intellectual , was also a soldier who had much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forged the revolution . By contrast , Chou was silkenly urbane , almost a throwback to the old Mandarin bureaucrats of imperial China . His courtly manners and experience in the ways of the world made him , outside China , a symbol of Oriental patience and guile . U.S. Secretary of State Kissinger was not the only Western diplomat who , after a treasured cup of tea with Chou in Peking 's Great Hall of the People , came away convinced that China 's Premier was " one of the most intelligent men I 've ever met . " For decades , he enjoyed instructing Westerners in the intricacies of Chinese politics . Recalls Author Theodore H. White , who knew Chou in the 1940s : " The greatest compliment he could pay anyone was to say , ' Aha ! At last you 're beginning to understand China . ' " Unlike Mao , Chou was not a theoretician , but rather a kind of inspired pragmatist- " a builder , not a poet , " as his old friend Journalist Edgar Snow put it .

Over the years , Chou became China 's indispensable man , an administrator whose control over the governing bureaucracy gave him the key to the day-to-day operations of the country , thereby allowing Mao to play the important but sometimes detached role of spiritual guide , dedicated to inspiring revolutionary spirit . <P> Despite his frail physique , Chou was seemingly inexhaustible . Like many other leaders of the Chinese revolution , he liked to work through the night . Visitors to China , even in recent years , were often ushered into Chou 's presence after midnight , finding him tireless and perpetually alert in conversations that lasted until daybreak . His wife Teng Yingchao , a prominent revolutionary in her own right , admitted that she was unable to persuade him to slow his exhausting tempo even after his declining health forced him to delegate some responsibility to his heir apparent , Vice Premier Teng.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
