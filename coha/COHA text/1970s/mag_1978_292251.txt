COVER STORY <P> Critics say its costly warships are vulnerable , its missions unclear <P> Richard Rodgers ' Victory at Sea comes lilting over the loudspeakers as the men prepare for war . It is not real war-just a game-but the men are very serious as they take their places in the wide , two-story room . More than 100 of them , in dark-blue uniforms with the gold sleeve stripes of admirals , commanders and captains , move to the banks of computer terminals in the center of the room and along the sea-green walls . <P> They are in the Center for War Gaming of the U.S. Naval War College at Newport , R.I. , and they are about to fight one of the institution 's most frequently simulated battles : a clash with the Soviets along the oil routes of the Indian Ocean . The " scenario " behind it says that U.S.-Soviet relations have become tense because of Soviet military buildups in Aden and Iraq . The U.S. believes the Soviets aim at cutting off oil supplies , and it " surges " an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aircraft-carrier strike group , a convoy escort group , attack submarines and antisubmarine patrol planes . The Soviet forces in the area include land-based bombers , missile-firing submarines , cruisers , destroyers and high-speed missile boats . The computer-the Warfare Analysis and Research System ( WARS ) - projects a display of the positions , speeds and courses of the ships involved on two 15-ft. screens on the back wall of the big room . <P> As the U.S. warships steam toward the Persian Gulf , intelligence reports warn that a large number of Soviet bombers have left their bases . At the same time , an American P-3C antisubmarine patrol plane detects a Soviet sub north of the carrier group and within missile range . <P> Reacting to what surely appears to be an imminent enemy attack , the U.S. commander orders two of his F-14 Tomcat supersonic fighters into the air . With their Phoenix missile system , the F-14s can shoot down both the Soviet jets and the missiles they fire . Into the air too goes a U.S. propeller-driven Hawkeye warning and control plane whose sophisticated radar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computers can monitor up to 300 targets simultaneously and report their location , speed and course to a computer aboard the F-14s . <P> When the Hawkeye reports " multiple radar contacts inbound " to the carrier , the U.S. commander sends more F-14s aloft . And on his direct line to the Pentagon command center , he requests permission for " weapon release " so that he can order his men to fire before being attacked . <P> In its war games , the U.S. Navy just about always wins . That is part of a tradition that goes back more than 200 years to the day when John Paul Jones , with his ship ablaze and sinking beneath him , shouted to the apparently victorious British , " I have not yet begun to fight ! " It is the gallant tradition of the Constitution ( " ... and many an eye has danced to see/That banner in the sky " ) , three times victorious over proud British frigates .
