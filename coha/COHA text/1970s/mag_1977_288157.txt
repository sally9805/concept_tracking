The pirate from Peachtree takes on the Aussies <P> At Manhattan 's venerable New York Yacht Club , where tradition changes as slowly as the membership rolls , they say that if a foreigner ever wins their hallowed trophy , it will be replaced in its case by the losing skipper 's head . Robert E. ( Ted ) Turner III , alias " the Mouth " Terrible Ted " and " Captain Outrageous , " is not worrying . Nor are the club 's blue-blazered elders . For if winds and weather-and the portents-are right , Terrible Ted this week will begin a successful defense of the America 's Cup . <P> Potbellied and ugly as the auld mug may be , it is the Holy Grail of yachting . Twenty-two attempts have been made to wrest the 100-guinea pitcher from the U.S. at a cost of untold millions of dollars . But the cup has remained of the firmly in the possession of the New York Yacht Club ever since it was won from Britain 's Royal Yacht Squadron in 1851 under the eyes of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break the longest winning streak in modern sports history , a new challenger from Down Under named Australia is squaring off with the 1974 U.S. defender , Courageous , skippered by Turner- the Peck 's Bad of Boy of yachting-in the waters off Newport , R.I. <P> Turner who works as hard at racing as he did in in building his Atlanta-based business empire ( an outdoor advertising company , two TV stations , the hapless Atlanta Braves ) , has no intention of losing the trophy . " We came to win , " he exhorted his ten-man crew last week , " and that 's what we 're doing , right ? " Among the eagle-eyed yachting fraternity that swarmed into historic Newport for the best-of-seven series , there was nearly unanimous agreement . Despite obvious progress since their last challenge three years ago with Southern Cross , Australian Real Estate Developer Alan Bond and his team have apparently not yet caught up with the Americans in the complex art of designing , outfitting and sailing the 12-meter thoroughbreds that now vie for the America 's Cup . Former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1964 , was so confident that he was predicting a victory for the Americans in four straight . <P> Still , even optimists like Bavier , a member of the U.S. selection committee that picked Turner 's dark horse Courageous over Ted Hood 's Independence and Lowell North 's Enterprise , conceded that the pirate from Peachtree Street might find himself in the first close America 's Cup race in years . Since 1958 , when the smaller twelves* replaced the giant J-boats of the ' 30s , no foreign challenger has won more than one race . But Australia is a virtual twin of Courageous-co-designed by Dutch-born Johan Valentijn who apprenticed under famed US 12-Meter Designer Olin Stephens , creator of Courageous . The low-slung challenger , which trounced rivals from France and Sweden to get a crack at Courageous , may well nearly match her in hull speed , and has a highly competent skipper in the respected Noel Robins , 41.
