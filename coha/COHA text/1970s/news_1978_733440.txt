txt The Carter administration has about given up hope that higher energy prices will induce individual Americans to waste less fuel , particularly gasoline . " Price signals , " says Energy Secretary James H. Schlesinger. " work better for industry than for consumers , who do not respond very well . " Gasoline prices , for example , would have to shoot up far beyond the present tia-to-70-cent-agallon range ? well above $1 a gallon ? before many Americans would cut back on their driving . And both houses of Congress , despite their deadlock on some key energy matters , shot down any prospect that gasoline prices would rise sharply by killing President Carter 's proposal for higher taxes on gasoline . What , then , is the answer to energy conservation , as Americans ? in stark contrast to more frugal Japanese and Europeans ? go on consuming more , not less , energy ?

Efficiency requirements are the very things which both the House and Senate retained in their versions of the Carter energy bill and which almost certainly will be included in the final law . Americans will get tax credits for insulating their homes , with the goal , says Mr. Schlesinger , of making " houses 30 percemt more fuel-efficient . " Large " gas guzzling " cars will be taxed , and year by year U.S.-made autos will be required to meet stricter mileage standards , with the average car sold in 1985 supposed to get more than 20 miles to the gallon . New energy-efficient standards also will be applied to major home appliances , with manufacturers of clothes dryers supposed to improve their product 's 1980 energy consumption , as compared with 1972 , by 11 percent . Makers of television sets will be expected to improve efficiency by 79 percent , and producers of freezers , ranges , room air conditioners , and other big-ticket items will have standards somewhere in between .

Where cars and home appliances are concerned , consumers will have no choice but tocut fuel consumption ? not because of price pressures , but because manufacturers will be obliged to offer more efficient models . The Carter energy plan takes a somewhat different approach to industry , whose corporate managers , says Mr. Schlesinger , have " sharp pencils " where savings are concerned , and thus are more responsible than individuals to price signals . Use of oil and natural gas , the two scarcest fuels , by utilities and industrial plants would be taxed heavily under the Carter plan , to impel a switch to more abundant coal as fuel . The House watered down the President 's " user tax " proposal and the Senate- weakened it further . But some kind of industrial user tax seems likely to emerge , when the Senate-House conference committee finally finishes its work and both chambers pass a national energy program into law .
