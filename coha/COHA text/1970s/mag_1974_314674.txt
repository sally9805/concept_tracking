PRINCE CHARLIE 'S BLUFF <P> by DONALD THOMAS 280 pages . Viking Press . $7.95 . <P> <P> Donald Thomas is one of a very small school of strong-minded historians whose members scorn the mild contrariness of revisionism . Revisionists , after all , merely prove that Stalin was a fine fellow , Henry VIII a picky eater and the U.S. started the cold war . Thomas and his ilk go much further . In this book , for example , Thomas reveals the fact that British General James Wolfe never took Quebec from the French in 1759 at all . The American colonies never banded together against King George III either . What actually happened was that Wolfe-no hero , but a mincing , vindictive incompetent-lost to Montcalm at Quebec and was later executed for his disgrace . Thereafter , all through the 1760s , the French hung on to Canada and the Ohio River valley , threatening colonial Virginia with invasion . The British meanwhile fell back on Boston and New York . <P> Well , then , a reader concludes , did the French win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Historian Thomas . A third force , not taken into account by either side , entered the picture . This was the royal house of Stuart , in the glittering person and presence of Bonnie Prince Charlie , the Young Pretender and son of the exiled Stuart King James III . The handsome , 39-year-old prince was beaten at Culloden in 1746 , when the infamous Duke of Cumberland broke the power of the Scottish clans . He fled to France with the price of 30,000 on his head , and traveled quietly to Virginia ( says Thomas ) under an assumed name . <P> Why should Prince Charles expect to be welcomed in Virginia ? Because the colony was heavily populated by Highlanders , many of whom had fought under him at Culloden . An additional force of Highlanders was captured by the French at Quebec , paroled , and then marched South to vex their former British masters . The British were unpopular in Virginia anyway , since they taxed whisky stills and kept recruiting farm boys to fight the French in howling wilderness . <P> Assassination Plot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one Lovatt Frazier , a young Highlander who is wounded at Quebec , and then in Virginia joins Prince Charlie 's court . Frazier has a gift for language ( " Colonel Byrd , a man of vast parade " ) and a sharp eye for cracks in fine facades ( " It seems that Mr. Randolph would declare for King James if only the King would then make nun comfortable in the office of attorney general " ) . The diarist , it develops , had the rare good luck to overhear a hitherto unrecorded conversation between Colonel George Washington and Prince Charles in which the master of Mount Vernon , although not hostile , remained uncharmed and uncommitted . Samuel Johnson is found to have made an otherwise unnoticed trip to the New World , and Patrick Henry and Tom Paine are implicated in a plot to assassinate Bonnie Prince Charlie !
