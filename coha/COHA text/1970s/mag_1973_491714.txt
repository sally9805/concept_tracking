" Speaking of Operations " is probably the most famous piece of straight humor that any magazine ever printed ( Saturday Evening Post , November 6 , 1915 ) . In the piece itself Cobb did not say why he had to have the operation ; that might have spoiled the effect . While following the German army in France in 1914 he had seen trainload after trainload of wounded arrive at the railroad yards in Maubeuge ; the orderlies who carried them to a nearby hospital collapsed from fatigue , and Cobb and other war correspondents pitched in to help . While lifting the wounded Cobb suffered a minor hernia . The operation was performed in April 1915 and soon afterward editor Lorimer wrote the sufferer as follows : " Dear Cobb : When your wife 's letter reached me today , saying that you were to be put on a diet . 1 had just finished dictating a note to Delmonico 's , asking them to send you a case of Pol Roger , ' 98 , two bottles of crusty old port , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porterhouse covered with mushrooms .

" Now that the last belated bill for services professionally rendered has been properly paid and properly receipted ; now that the memory of the event , like the mark of the stitches , has faded out from a vivid red to a becoming pink shade ; now that I pass a display of adhesive tape in a drugstore window without flinching-I sit me down to write a link piece about a certain matter -- a small thing , but mine own-to wit , That Operation . For years I have noticed that persons who underwent pruning or remodeling at the hands of a duly qualified surgeon , and survived , liked to talk about it afterward . In the event of their not surviving , I have no doubt they still liked to talk about it , but in a different locality .

Wherever two or more are gathered together , it is reasonably certain that somebody will bring up an operation . Until I passed through the experience myself , however , I never really realized what a precious conversational boon the subject is , and how great a part it plays in our intercourse with our fellow beings on this planet . To the teller it is enormously interesting , for he is not only the hero of the tale but the rest of the cast and the stage setting as well-the whole show as they say ; and if the listener has had a similar experience-and who is there among us in these days that has not taken a nap ' neath the shade of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Speaking of operations ? " you say , just like that , even though nobody present has spoken of them ; and then you are off , with your new acquaintance sitting on the edge of his chair , or hers as the case may be and frequently is , with hands clutched in polite but painful restraint , gills working up and down with impatience , eyes brightened with desire , tongue hung in the middle , waiting for you to pause to catch your breath , so that he or she may break in with a few personal recollections along the same line . From a mere conversation it resolves itself into a symptom symposium , and a perfectly splendid time is had by all . If an operation is such a good thing to talk about , why is n't it a good thing to write about too ? That is what I wish to know . Besides , I need the money . Verily , one always needs the money when one has but recently escaped from the ministering clutches of the modern hospital . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bright morning when I went to call on a prominent practitioner here in New York , whom I shall denominate as Doctor X. I had a pain . I had had it for days . It was not a dependable , locatable pain , such as a tummyache or a toothache is , which you can put your hand on ; but an indefinite , unsettled , undecided kind of pain , which went wandering about from place to place inside of me like a strange ghost lost in Cudjo 's Cave . I never knew until then what the personal sensations of a haunted house are . If only the measly thing could have made up its mind to settle down somewhere and start housekeeping , I think I should have been better and waving . hi the profession bosky whiskers are taboo ; they must be landscaped . And since it is a recognized fact that germs abhor orderliness and straight lines , they now go elsewhere to reside , and the doctor may still retain his traditional aspect and yet be practically germproof . Doctor X was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . He had trellis whiskers . So I went to see him at his offices in a fashionable district , on an expensive side street . Before reaching him I passed through the hands of a maid and a nurse , each of whom spoke to me in a low , sorrowful tone of voice , which seemed to indicate that there was very satisfied . I never had such an uneasy tenant . Alongside of it a woman with the moving fever would be comparatively a fixed and stationary object . Having always , therefore , enjoyed perfectly riotous and absolutely unbridled health , never feeling weak and distressed unless dinner happened to be ten or fifteen minutes late , I was green regarding physicians and the ways of physicians . But I knew Doctor X slightly , having met him last summer in one of his hours of ease in the grandstand at a ball game , when he was expressing a desire to cut the umpire 's throat from ear to ear , free of charge ; and I remembered his name , and remembered , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a person of character and decision and scholarly attainments . He wore whiskers . Somehow in my mind whiskers are ever associated with medical skill . l presume this is a heritage of my youth , though I believe others labor under the same impression . As I look back it seems to me that in childhood 's days all the doctors in our town wore whiskers. l recall one old doctor down there in Kentucky who was practically lurking in ambush all the time . All he needed was a few decoys out in front of him and a pump gun to be a duck blind . He carried his calomel about with him in a fruit jar , and when there was a cutting job to be done he stropped his scalpel on his bootleg . You see , in those primitive times germs had not been invented yet , and so he did not have to take any steps to avoid them . Now we know that loose , luxuriant whiskers are insanitary , because they make such fine winter quarters for germs ; so , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them wild little hope . I reached an inner room where Doctor X was . He looked me over , while I described for him as best I could what seemed to be the matter with me , and asked me a number of intimate questions touching on the lives , works , characters and peculiarities of my ancestors ; after which he made me stand up in front of him and take my coat off , and he punched me hither and yon with his forefinger . He also knocked repeatedly on my breastbone with his knuckles , and each time , on doing this , would apply his ear to my chest and listen intently for a spell , afterward shaking his head in a disappointed way . Apparently there was nobody at home . For quite a time he kept on knocking , but without getting any response . He then took my temperature and fifteen dollars , and said it was an interesting case  --  not unusual exactly , but interesting  --  and that it called for an operation . From the way my heart and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew at once that , no matter what he may have thought , the premises were not unoccupied . Naturally I inquired how soon he meant to operate . Personally I trusted there was no hurry about it . I was perfectly willing to wait for several years if necessary . He smiled at my ignorance . " I never operate , " he said . " Operating is entirely out of my line . I am a diagnostician . " He was too  --  I give him full credit for that . He was a good , keen , close diagnostician . How did he know I had only fifteen dollars on me ? You did not have to tell this man what you had , or how much . He knew without being told . I asked whether he was acquainted with Doctor Y  --  Y being a person whom I had met casually at a club to which I belong . Oh , yes , he said , he knew Doctor Y. Y was a clever man , Xsaid  --  very , very clever ; but Y specialized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the throat . I gathered from what Doctor X said that any time Doctor Y ventured below the thorax he was out of bounds and liable to be penalized ; and that if by any chance he strayed down as far as the lungs he would call for help and back out as rapidly as possible . This was news to me . It would appear that these up-to-date practitioners just go ahead and divide you up and partition you out among themselves without saying anything to you about it . Your torso belongs to one man and your legs are the exclusive property of his brother practitioner down on the next block , and so on . You may belong to as many as half a dozen specialists , most of whom , very possibly , are total strangers to you , and yet never know a thing about it yourself . It has rather the air of trespass  --  nay , more than that , it bears some of the aspects of unlawful entry  --  but 1 suppose it is legal . Certainly , judging by what I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally . So it must be ethical . Anything doctors do in a mass is ethical . Almost anything they do singly and on individual responsibility is unethical . Being ethical among doctors is practically the same thing as being a Democrat in Texas or a Presbyterian in Scotland . " Y will never do for you , " said Doctor X , when I had rallied somewhat from the shock of these disclosures . " I would suggest that you go to Doctor Z , at such-and-such an address . You are exactly in Z 's line . I 'll let him know that you are coming and when , and I 'll send him down my diagnosis . " So that same afternoon , the appointment having been made by telephone , I went , full of quavery emotions , to Doctor Z 's place . As soon as I was inside his outer hallway , I realized that 1was nearing the presence of one highly distinguished in his profession . A pussy-footed male attendant , in a livery that made him look like a cross between a headwaiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anteroom into a reception room , where a considerable number of well-dressed men and women were sitting about in strained attitudes , pretending to read magazines while they waited their turns , but in reality furtively watching one another . I sat down in a vacant chair , holding fast to my hat and my umbrella . They were the only friends I had there and I was determined not to lose them without a struggle . On the wall were many colored charts showing various portions of the human anatomy and what ailed them . Directly in front of me was a very thrilling illustration , evidently copied from an oil painting , of a liver in a bad state of repair . I said to myself that if I had a liver like that one I should keep it hidden from public eye  --  I would never permit it to sit for its portrait . Still , there is no accounting for tastes . I know a man who got his spleen hack from the doctors and now keeps it in a bottle of alcohol on the what-not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sometimes shows it to visitors . He , however , is of a very saving disposition . Presently a lady secretary , who sat behind a roll-top desk in a corner of the room , lifted a forefinger and silently beckoned me to her side . I moved over and sat down by her ; she took down my name and my age and my weight and my height , and a number of other interesting facts that will come in very handy should anyone ever be moved to write a complete history of my early life . In common with Doctor X , she shared one attribute  --  she manifested a deep curiosity regarding my forefathers  --  wanted to know all about them . I felt that this was carrying the thing too far . I felt like saying to her : " Miss or madam , so far as I know there is nothing the matter with my ancestors of the second and third generations back , except that they are dead . I am not here to seek medical assistance for a grandparent who succumbed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or for a great-grandparent who entered into Eternal Rest very unexpectedly and in a manner entirely uncalled for as a result of being an innocent bystander in one of those feuds that were so popular in my native state immediately following the Mexican War . Leave my ancestors alone . There is no need of your shaking my family tree in the belief that a few overripe patients will fall out . I alone  --  I , me , myself  --  am the present candidate ! " However , I refrained from making this protest audibly . I judged she was only going according to the ritual ; and as she had a printed card , with blanks in it ready to be filled out with details regarding the remote members of the family connection , I humored her along . When I could not remember something she wished to know concerning an ancestor , I supplied her with thrilling details culled from the field of fancy . When the card was entirely filled up , she sent me back to my old place to wait . 1 waited and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had started out with one symptom ; now if I had one I had a million and a half . I could feel goose flesh sprouting out all over me . If I had been taller I might have had more , but not otherwise . Such is the power of the human imagination when the surroundings are favorable to its development . Time passed ; to me it appeared that nearly all the time there was passed and that we were getting along toward the shank-end of the Christian era mighty fast . I was afraid my turn would come next and afraid it would not . Perhaps you know this sensation . You get it at the dentist 's , and when you are on the list of after-dinner speakers at a large banquet , and when you are waiting for the father of the Only Girl in the World to make up his mind whether he is willing to try to endure you as a son-in-law Then some more time passed . One by one my companions , obeying a command , passed out through the door at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None of them returned . I was vaguely wondering whether Doctor Z buried his dead on the premises or had them removed by a secret passageway in the rear , when a young woman in a nurse 's costume tapped me on the shoulder from behind . As I jumped she hid a compassionate smile with her hand and told me that the doctor would see me now . As I rose to follow her  --  still clinging with the drowning man 's grip of desperation to my hat and my umbrella  --  I was astonished to note by a glance at the calendar on the wall that this was still the present date . I thought it would be Thursday of next week at the very least . Doctor Z also wore whiskers , carefully pointed up by an expert hedge trimmer . He sat at his desk , surrounded by freewill offerings from grateful patients and by glass cases containing other things he had taken away from them when they were not in a condition to object . I had expected , after all the preliminary ceremonies and delays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not so ; not at all . The modern expert in surgery charges as much for remembering your name between visits as the family doctor used to expect for staying up all night with you , but he does not waste any time when you are in his presence . I was about to find that out . And a little later on I was to find out a lot of other things ; in fact , that whole week was of immense educational value to me . I presume it was because he stood so high in his profession , and was almost constantlyengaged in breaking into members of the first families , that Doctor Z did not appear to be the least bit excited over my having picked him out to look into me . In the most perfunctory manner , he shook the hand that has shaken the hands of Jess Willard , George M. Cohan and Henry Ford , and bade me be seated in a chair which was drawn up in a strong light , where he might gaze directly at me as we conversed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if I was a treat for him to look at , he concealed his emotions very effectually . From this point on everything passed off in a most businesslike manner . He reached into a filing cabinet and took out an exhibit , which I recognized as the same one his secretary had tilled out in the early part of the century . So I was already in the card-index class . Then briefly he looked over the manifest that Doctor X had sent him . It may not have been a manifest  --  it may have been an invoice or a bill of lading . Anyhow , I was in the assignee 's hands . I could only hope it would not eventually become necessary to call in a receiver . Then he spoke : " Yes , yes-yes , " he said ; " yes-yes-yes ! Operation required . Small matter  --  hum , hum ! Let 's see  --  this is Tuesday ? Quite so . Do it Friday ! Friday at ? " he glanced toward a scribbled pad of engagement dates at his elbow ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven-fifteen . Have important tumor case at seven . St. Germicide 's Hospital . You know the place ? ? up on U mpty- um ph Street . Go ' day ! Miss Whoziz , call next visitor . " And before I realized that practically the whole affair had been settled , I was outside the consultation room in a small private hall , and the secretary was telling me further details would be conveyed to me by mail . I went home in a dazed state . For the first time I was beginning to learn something about an industry in which heretofore I had never been interested . Especially was I struck by the difference now revealed to me in the preliminary stages of the surgeons ' business as compared with their fellow experts in the allied cutting trades  --  tailors , for instance , not to mention barbers . Every barber , you know , used to be a surgeon , only he spelled it chirurgeon . Since then the two professions have drifted far apart . Even a half-witted barber  --  the kind who always has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can easily spend ten minutes of your time thinking of things he thinks you should have and mentioning them to you one by one , whereas any good , live surgeon knows what you have almost instantly . As for the tailor  --  consider how wearisome are his methods when you parallel them alongside the tremendous advances in this direction made by the surgeon  --  how cumbersome and old-fashioned and tedious ! Why , an experienced surgeon has you all apart in half the time the tailor takes up in deciding whether the vest shall fasten with five buttons or six . Our own domestic tailors are bad enough in this regard , and the Old World tailors are even worse . I remember a German tailor in Aix-la-Chapelle last year who undertook to build for me a suit suitable for visiting the battle lines informally . He was the most literary tailor I ever met anywhere . He would drape the material over my person and then take a piece of chalk and write quite a nice long piece on me . Then he would rub it out and write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept this up at intervals of every other day until he had writer 's cramp . After that he used pins . He would pin the seams together , uttering little soothing , clucking sounds in German whenever a pin went through the goods and into me . The German cluck is not so soothing as the cluck of the English-speaking peoples , I find . At the end of two long and trying weeks , which wore both of us down noticeably , he had the job done . It was not an unqualified success . He regarded it as a suit of clothes , but I knew better : it was a set of slip covers , and if only I had been a two-seated runabout it would have proved a perfect fit , I am sure ; but I am a single-seated design and it did not answer . I wore it to the war because I had nothing else to wear that would stamp me as a regular war correspondent , except of course , my wrist watch ; but I shall not wear it to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , besides , I have parted with it . On my way home through Holland I gave that suit to a couple of poor Belgian refugees , and I presume they are still wearing it . So far as I have been able to observe , the surgeons and the tailors of these times share but one common instinct : If you go to a new surgeon or to a new tailor , he is morally certain , after looking you over , that the last surgeon you had , or the last tailor , did not do your cutting properly . There , however , is where the resemblance ends . The tailor , as I remarked in effect just now , wants an hour at least in which to decide how he may best cover up and disguise the irregularities of the human form ; in much less time than that , the surgeon has completely altered the form itself . With the surgeon it is very much as it is with those learned men who write those large , impressive works of reference which should be permanently in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an agent because we are so passionately addicted to weekly payments . If the thing he seeks does not appear in the contents proper , he knows exactly where to look for it . " See appendix , " says the historian to you in a footnote . " See appendix , " says the surgeon to himself , the while humming a cheery refrain . And so he does . Well , I went home . This was Tuesday and the operation was not to be performed until the coming Friday . By Wednesday I had calmed down considerably . By Thursday morning I was practically normal again as regards my nerves . You will understand that I was still in a state of blissful ignorance concerning the actual methods of the surgical profession as exemplified by its leading exponents of today . The knowledge I have touched on in the paragraphs immediately preceding was to come to me later . Likewise , Doctor Z 's manner had deceived me . It could not be that he meant to carve me to any really noticeable extent  --  his attitude had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very serious matter . Any time I take the head of the table and start in to carve , it is fitting to remove the women and children to a place of safety , and bystanders should get under the table . When we first started housekeeping and gave our first small dinner party , we had a brace of ducks cooked in honor of the company and I , as host , undertook to carve them . I never knew until then that a duck was inclosed in a burglarproof case . Without the use of dynamite , the Red Leary-O'Brien gang could not have broken into those ducks . I thought so then and I think so yet . Years have passed since then , but I may state that even now , when there are guests in for dinner , we do not have ducks . Unless somebody else is going to carve , we have liver . I mention this fact in passing because it shows that I had learned to revere carving as one of the higher arts , and one not to be approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the undertaking , and after proper consideration and thought and reflection , and all that sort of thing . If this were true as regards a mere duck , why not all the more so as regards the carving of a person of whom I am so very fond as I am of myself ? Thus I reasoned . And finally , had not Doctor Z spoken of the coming operation as a small matter ? Well , then ? Thursday at noon I received from Doctor Z 's secretary a note stating that arrangements had been made for my admission into St. Germicide that same evening and that I was to spend the night there . This hardly seemed necessary . Still , the tone of the note seemed to indicate that the hospital authorities particularly wished to have me for an overnight guest ; and as I reflected that probably the poor things had few enough bright spots in their busy lives , I decided I would humor them along and gladden the occasion with my presence from dinnertime on . About eight o'clock I strolled in very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mapped out . I would stay at the hospital for , say , two days following the operation  --  or , at most , three . Then I must be up and away . I had a good deal of work to do and a number of people to see on important business , and I could not really afford to waste more than a week-end on the staff of St. Germicide 's . After Monday they must look to their own devices for social entertainment . That was my idea . Now when I look back on it I laugh , but it is a hollow laugh and there is no real merriment in it . Indeed , almost from the moment of my entrance , little things began to come up that were calculated to have a depressing effect on one 's spirits . Downstairs a serious-looking lady met me and entered in a book a number of salient facts regarding my personality which the previous investigators had somehow overlooked . There is a lot of bookkeeping about an operation . This detail attended to , a young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamped him as one who had suffered a recent deep bereavement , came and relieved me of my hag and escorted me upstairs . As we passed through the upper corridors , I had my first introduction to the hospital smell , which is a smell compounded of iodoform , ether , gruel , and something boiling . All hospitals have it , I understand . In time you get used to it , but you never really care for it . The young man let me into a small room tastefully decorated with four walls , a floor , a ceiling , a windowsill and a window , a door and a doorsill , and a bed and a chair . He told me to go to bed . I did not want to go to bed  --  it was not my regular bedtime  --  but he made a point of it , and I judged it was according to regulations ; so I undressed and put on my night clothes and crawled in . He left me , taking my other clothes and my shoes with him ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later a ward surgeon appeared , to put a few inquiries of a pointed and personal nature . He particularly desired to know what my trouble was . I explained to him that I could n't tell him  --  he would have to see Doctor X or Doctor Z ; they probably knew , but were keeping it a secret between themselves . The answer apparently satisfied him , because immediately after that he made me sign a paper in which I assumed all responsibility for what was to take place the next morning . This did not seem exactly fair . As I pointed out to him , it was the surgeon 's affair , not mine ; and if the surgeon made a mistake the joke would be on him and not on me , because in that case I would not be here anyhow . But I signed , as requested , on the dotted line , and he departed . After that , at intervals , the chief house surgeon dropped in , without knocking , and the head nurse came , and an interne or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was to have direct charge of me . It dawned on me that I was not having any more privacy in that hospital than a goldfish . About eleven o'clock an orderly came ; and , without consulting my wishes in the matter , he undressed me until I could have passed almost anywhere for September Morn 's father , and gave me a clean shave , twice over , on one of my most prominent plane surfaces . I must confess I enjoyed that part of it . So far as I am able to recall , it was the only shave I have ever had where the operator did not spray me with cheap perfumery afterward and then try to sell me a bottle of hair tonic . Having shaved me , the young man did me up amidships in a neat cloth parcel , took his kit under his arm and went away . It occurred to me that , considering the trivial nature of the case , a good deal of fuss was beingmade over me by persons who could have no personal concern in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lay there , all tied in a bundle like a week 's washing . I did not feel quite so uppish as I had felt . Why was everybody picking on me ? Anon I slept , but dreamed fitfully . I dreamed that a whole flock of surgeons came to my bedside and charted me out in sections , like one of those diagram pictures you see of a beef in the Handy Compendium of Universal Knowledge , showing the various cuts and the butcher 's pet name for each cut . Each man took his favorite joint and carried it away , and when they were all gone I was merely a recent site , full of reverberating echoes and nothing else . I have had happier dreams in my time ; this was not the kind of dream I should have selected had the choice been left to me . When I woke the young sun was shining in at the window , and an orderly  --  not the orderly who had shaved me , but another one  --  was there in my room and my nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a quaint suit of pyjamas cut on the half shell and buttoning stylishly in the back , princesse mode . Then he rolled in a flat litter on wheels and stretched me on it , and covered me up with a white tablecloth , just as though I had been cold Sunday-night supper , and we started for the operating room at the top of the building ; but before we started I lit a large black cigar , as General U. S. Grant used to do when he went into battle . I wished by this to show how indifferent I was . Maybe he fooled somebody , but I do not believe I possess the same powers of simulation that Grant had . Hemust have been a very remarkable man  --  Grant must . The orderly and the nurse trundled me out into the hall and loaded me into an elevator , which was to carry us up to the top of the hospital . Several other nurses were already in the elevator . As we came aboard one of them remarked that it was a fine day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish the sentence . Everybody wore a serious look . Inside of myself I felt pretty serious too  --  serious enough for ten or twelve . I had meant to fling off several very bright , spontaneous quips on the way to the table . I thought them out in advance , but now , somehow , none of them seemed appropriate . Instinctively , as it were , I felt that humor was out of place here . I never knew an elevator to progress from the third floor of a building to the ninth with such celerity as this one on which we were traveling progressed . Personally I was in no mood for haste . If there was anyone else in all that great hospital who was in a particular hurry to be operated on , I was perfectly willing to wait . But alas , no ! The mechanism of the elevator was in perfect order  --  entirely too perfect . No accident of any character whatsoever befell us en route ; no dropping hack into the basement with a low , grateful thud ; no hitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of luck that trip . The demon of a joyrider who operated the accursed device jerked a lever and up we soared at a distressingly high rate of speed . If I could have had my way about that youth , he would have been arrested for speeding . large room , all white , with a rounded ceiling like the inside of an egg . Right away I knew what the feelings of a poor , lonely little yolk are when the spoon begins to chip the shell . If I had not been so busy feeling sorry for myself , I think I might have developed an active sympathy for yolks . My impression had been that this was to be in the nature of a private affair , without invitations . I was astonished to note that quite a crowd had assembled for the opening exercises . From his attire and general deportment , I judged that Doctor Z was going to be the master of the revels , he being attired appropriately in a white domino , with rubber gloves and a fancy cap of crash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , Doctor X , likewise in fancy-dress costume , and a surgeon I had never met . From what I could gather , he was going over the course behind Doctor Z to replace the divots . And there was an interne in the background , playing caddy , as it were , and a head nurse , who was going to keep the score , and two other nurses , who were going to help her keep it . I only hoped that they would show no partiality , but be as fair to me as they were to Doctor Z , and that he would go round in par . So they placed me right where my eyes might rest on a large wall cabinet full of very shiny-looking tools ; and they took my cigar away from me and folded my hands on the wide bowknot of my sash . Then they put a cloth dingus over my face and a voice of authority told me to breathe . That advice , however , was superfluous and might just as well have been omitted , for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything at all , breathing has been a regular habit with me . So I breathed . And , at that , a bottle of highly charged sarsaparilla exploded somewhere in the immediate vicinity and most of its contents went up my nose . 1 started to tell them that somebody had been fooling with their ether and adulterating it , and that if they thought they could send me off to sleep with soda pop they were making the mistake of their lives , because it just naturally could not be done ; but for some reason or other I decided to put off speaking about the matter for a few minutes . 1 breathed aga in  --  again  --  agai- I was going away from there . I was in a large gas balloon , soaring up into the clouds , flow pleasant ! .. . No , by Jove ! I was not in a balloon  --  I myself was the balloon , which was not quite so pleasant . Besides , Doctor Z was going along as a passenger ; and as we traveled up and up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ umbrella which he had brought along with him in case of rain . He jabbed me harder and hard er . I remonstrated with him . I told him I was a bit tender in that locality and the ferrule of his umbrella was sharp . He would not listen . He kept on jabbing me . . . . Something broke ! We started back down to earth . We fell faster and faster . We fell nine miles , and after that I began to get used to it . Then I saw the earth beneath and it was rising up fo meet us . A town was below  --  a town that grew larger and larger as we neared it . I could make out the bonded indebtedness , and the Carnegie Library , and the moving-picture palaces , and the new dancing parlor , and other principal points of interest . At the rate we were falling , we were certainly going to make an awful splatter in that town when we hit . I was sorry for the street-cleaning department . We fell another half-mile or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly beneath us , like a spear , to impale us . By a supreme effort I twisted out of the way of that spire , only to strike squarely on top of the roof of a greenhouse back of the parsonage , next door . We crashed through it with a perfectly terrific clatter of breaking glass and landed in a bed of white flowers , all soft and downy like feathers . And then Doctor Z stood up and combed the debris out of his whiskers and remarked that , taking it by and large , it had been one of the pleasantest little outings he had enjoyed in the entire course of his practice . He said that as a patient I was fair , but as a balloon I was immense . tie asked me whether I had seen anything of his umbrella and began looking round for it . I tried to help him look , but I was too tired to exert myself much . I told him I believed I would take a little nap . I opened a dizzy eye part way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swam before my languid gaze ? No , it could not be  --  it did not smell like heaven , It smelled like a hospital . It was a hospital . It was my hospital . My nurse was bending over me and I caught a faint whiff of the starch in the front of her crisp blue blouse . She was two-headed for the moment , but that was a mere detail . She settled a pillow under my head and told me to lie quiet . I meant to lie quiet ; I did not have to he told . I wanted to lie quiet and hurt . I was hurty from head to toe and back again , and crosswise and catercornered. 1 hurt diagonally and lengthwise and on the bias . I had a taste in my mouth like a bird-andanimal store . And empty ! It seemed to me those doctors had not left anything inside of me except the acoustics . Well , there was a mite of consolation there . If the overhauling had been as thorough as I had reason to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear catching anything again so long as I lived , except possibly dandruff . I waved the nurse away . I craved solitude . I desired only to lie there in that bed and hurt -- which I did . I had said beforehand I meant to stay in St. Germicide 's for two or three days only . It is when I look back on that resolution that I emit the hollow laugh elsewhere referred to . For exactly four weeks I was flat on my back . I know now how excessively wearied a man can get of his own back , how tired of it , how bored with it ! And after that another two weeks elapsed before my legs became the same dependable pair of legs I had known in the past . I did not want to eat at first , and when I did begin to want to they would not let me . If I felt real peckish , they let me suck a little glass thermometer , but there is not much nourishment really in thermometers . And for entertainment , to while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ceiling and read my temperature chart , which was a good deal like Red Ames ' batting average for the past season  --  ranging from ninety-nine to one hundred and four . I shall never forget my first real meal ! There was quite a good deal of talk about it beforehand . My nurse kept telling me that on the next day the doctor had promised I might have something to eat . I could hardly wait . I had visions of a tenderloin steak smothered in fried onions , and some French-fried potatoes , and a tall table-limit stack of wheat cakes , and a few other incidental comfits and kickshaws . I could hardly wait for that meal . The next day came and she brought it to me , and I partook thereof . It was the white of an egg . For dessert I licked a stamp ; but this I did clandestinely and by stealth , without saying anything about it to her . I was not supposed to have any sweets . make possible union ( " enosis " ) with Greece . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , turned Cyprus into a crown colony instead . In 1931 and again in 1955 came rebellions against the British , with the Greek majority demanding " enosis , " and the Turkish Cypriots , backed by Turkey , threatening to turn the civil conflict into a war if any serious move toward union with Greece should be taken . By 1959 the British had had enough and negotiated a complicated and qualified kind of independence for Cyprus at an international conference in London , attended by representatives of Greece , Turkey , the United Kingdom and official delegations of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots . The result of that conference was the Republic of Cyprus , with one of the most detailed and rigid constitutions in history . The President must always be Greek and the Vice-President must always be Turkish . The Council of Ministers , it was agreed , should consist of ten members , of whom seven should be Greek , three Turkish , and of the three most powerful ministers  --  Foreign Affairs , Defense and Finance  --  one should always be a Turk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 percent from the Greek community ; 30 percent from the Turkish community . Either the Greek President or the Turkish Vice-President could veto any decision of the House affecting foreign affairs . And either official could refer to a Supreme Constitutional Court ( one Greek , one Turk and one neutral ) any legislative act that was thought to discriminate against either ethnic group . Moreover , the basic articles of the constitution could not be amended and the minor articles could be amended only by a two-thirds vote of both communal groups in the House of Representatives . The security and independence of Cyprus was guaranteed by Greece , Turkey and Great Britain , each of which had certain rights , in effect , to interfere in the internal affairs of the new republic , though the strongest official links remained with Britain . As a member of the British Commonwealth , Cyprus has kept its currency ties to the pound sterling , has developed strong trade links with Britain , has granted Britain the right to retain military bases , and has become a favorite tourist and retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal political crisis and the constant threat of inter-communal violence . The complicated constitutional system , unfortunately , never worked very well ; suspicions and antagonisms were too great on both sides . By the middle of 1963 the Greek majority , led by President-Archbishop Makarios , had started a series of moves to get the constitution changed , primarily to reduce the 30 percent Turkish quota in the Parliament to something closer to their 20 percent share of the population . Moreover , Makarios and other Greek Cypriots continued to make statements about union with Greece . The Turkish Cypriots , increasingly alarmed about their future , began to agitate for partition of the island , or at least some sort of self-governing federal arrangement . These political arguments , by December , had led to armed conflict . Scores of people were killed , several hundred were wounded . Both the Greek and Turkish governments talked of military intervention . Britain increased its troop strength on Cyprus . Emergency sessions of the Security Council led to a great flurry of diplomatic activity . A special international conference met in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plan to solve the crisis with the use of NATO troops and a mediator , but that proposal got nowhere , either . Meanwhile , Nikita Khrushchev , then riding high , made outrageously provocative declarations , blaming the British and the Americans , warning against NATO involvement and promising support to Makarios and the Greek Cypriot side . All that sounds like ancient history now , but for a time it almost looked as if Cyprus would see an all-out internal bloodletting , Greece and Turkey would go to war , NATO would fly apart , and even the Americans and the Soviets could get into a nuclear confrontation . Calmer minds eventually won out , however , and the UN Security Council , on February 19 , 1964 , voted to establish an international peace-keeping force to prevent a resumption of fighting and to prepare the conditions for a peaceful settlement . Canada , Finland , Sweden , Ireland , and Austria provided the troops ; the Indians provided the commanding generals  --  and the United States and the United Kingdom provided most of the money . Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not blown up and the international war it could easily have set off a dozen times has not happened . But peace has not happened either . The UN peace-keeping forces , now reduced to about 3,000 men , are still around and their mission is still as described to me by a Canadian general : " to keep the Turks and the Greeks from killing each other . " Nowadays Makarios and many of the Greek community are not all that enthusiastic about union with Greece . Many of them are opposed to being under the rule of the conservative colonels who now govern in Athens . This is particularly true of t he communist-dominated trade unions who constitute a substantial part of the backing for His Eminence , President-Archbishop Makarios . The Soviet leaders no longer make meddlesome pronouncements . Neither the Turkish Government nor the Greek Government seems to want another crisis . And , finally , talks between the Greek Cypriot leaders and Turkish Cypriot leaders are slowly inching along . Nobody will predict peaceful agreement in those talks or that they will reach even a conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam . On certain things everybody can agree , however : Cyprus is a beautiful place to live , the climate is marvelous , the air service is superb , the UN troops bring money into the economy , as do the tourists and the foreign pensioners and the transiting passengers needing a decontamination junction between Israel and the Arab states , and vice versa . Most people most of the time will also agree it is better to make money than to make war . rs
