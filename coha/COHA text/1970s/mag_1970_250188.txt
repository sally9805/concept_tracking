Non-smokers won a small but satisfying victory last week . Pan American World Airways announced that smoking will be banned in three rows of first-class seats and four rows of economy seats aboard its 747 superjets . Unless the aircraft is full , non-smokers will be separated from smokers by a couple of buffer rows . Though it would seem more logical for the smokers to have to seek out special seats , Pan Am 's decision at least represented the first recognition of nonsmokers ' rights in the air . <P> The idea may be catching , and other airlines are looking into it . The Federal Aviation Administration , under pressure from Consumer Advocates Ralph Nader and John Banzhaf III , is considering a ruling that would require the lines to separate smokers and nonsmokers . Not only does cigarette smoke befoul cabin air , which is pressurized at the equivalent of 2,500 ft. - 3,500 ft. and is thinner than air at ground level , but tobacco tars have been known to gum up sensitive gyros on aircraft instrument panels .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
