Only then do the doors burst open , and a cloaked , bearded , shaven-headed figure strides forward , accompanied by four armed bodyguards ( " You just ca n't be too careful with a man of this stature , " says his manager ) . A black girl doing an " African dance of adoration " stops long enough to remove Hayes ' orange , black and white cape , revealing him arrayed in black tights , fur cuffs , a leather vest and a necklace of gold chains . <P> He sits down behind the organ and launches into a jazz-styled number called Do Your Own Thing . In the course of two hours he sings only six or seven pieces : long , intricate blends of soul , blues , rock , white pop and gospel , with titles like One Big Unhappy Family , I Stand Accused or Our Day Will Come ! Then , tossing a handful of Isaac Hayes medallions to the crowd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is over . <P> At 28 , Isaac Hayes is the brightest new black pop star in the U.S. , the composer of the hit song from the movie Shaft ( now in the top five on the charts ) and a singer whose last four LPs have all been what the trade calls " platinum " disks ( earning $2,000,000 wholesale ) . <P> Such success enables Hayes to drive around in a Jaguar or one of his two Cadillacs ; he has a third on order with gold-plated bumpers .

He spent one night sleeping on a crap table , one whole summer living in a junked car . <P> In 1964 Hayes teamed up with Lyricist David Porter and started composing songs for Memphis-based Stax Records . Then , as now , he could neither read nor write music ; he hummed his melodies into one tape recorder , his rhythms into another , and left it to an arranger to combine them . In four years Hayes and Porter turned out enough hits , like Soul Man , Baby and Hold On , I 'm Coming , to guarantee them a respectable place in the history of songwriting . <P> Into their songs , Hayes and Porter injected the whole experience of the black ghetto . Hayes ' style , though , is much smoother than that of the ghetto blues shouters . In his throaty baritone , he sings with the cool , unruffled lyricism of a Lou Rawls . And the orchestrations provided for him are so rich in their classical scoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been joined by the Memphis Symphony-which is sometimes the case .
