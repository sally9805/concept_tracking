The U.S. Naval Observatory needed a new survey of Jupiter 's moons as a navigational aid for future space probes . To assemble the vital data , it turned not to a top-ranking astronomer but to an unassuming Caltech research associate who had no Ph.D. , had published no papers and had no other academic achievements to his name . " I know nothing about astrophysics or electrodynamics , " says Charles Kowal , 34 . " All I 'm good at is using a telescope . " <P> Topsy-Turvy Life . As the Naval Observatory was well aware , that was more than good enough . Last year in the course of his survey with the big 481n . Schmidt telescope atop California 's Palomar mountain , Kowal discovered Jupiter 's 13th moon , the first new satellite to be found in the solar system in eight years . So it was not exactly a surprise to Naval Observatory astronomers when Kowal repeated his triumph by discovering the 14th Jovian satellite , a moonlet only a few miles in diameter . " It 's not like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's more like the discovery of Catalina Island . " <P> Not quite . Finding so tiny an object at such great distance ( 400 million miles ) demanded extraordinary perseverence and precision . " I wake up and eat breakfast with the moon , " says Kowal of his topsy-turvy life at Palomar . " Dinner comes at midnight and lunch is at 5 a.m . " Before exposing each photographic plate in the telescope , he baked the film for five hours in a nitrogen-filled oven to make it highly sensitive . Afterward , he sat eight to ten hours at a stretch in a darkened room before a device called a blink microscope . One after another , in rapid succession , the microscope gave him glimpses of two plates , each showing the same section of sky at different times . When a speck on one of the star-filled pictures seemed to move against the background of " fixed " stars as the device shifted back and forth , the change indicated the presence of a moving object in the solar system-an asteroid , comet or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kowal has been infatuated with astronomy since , as a six-year-old in Buffalo , he read a book titled The Stars in Myth and Fact . Soon he was building his own telescopes out of pieces of pipe , cardboard tubing and home-ground mirrors . After graduating from the University of Southern California in 1961 , he decided to apply to Caltech 's astronomy department for a job ; he had no taste for graduate studies . Explains Kowal : " I enjoy learning things , but a university is the last place in the world to learn anything . " <P> As his first assignment at Palomar. which is owned by Caltech , Kowal searched for supernovas-the great stellar explosions that mark the death of giant stars . None has been observed in the earth 's Milky Way Galaxy since 1604 , but the sharp-eyed Kowal has found 77 supernovas in distant galaxies . He has also participated in an international search for " lost " comets that have shifted their course . So far , Kowal has spotted three such cosmic strays.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
