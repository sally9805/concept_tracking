MORE THAN YOU DESERVE Book by MICHAEL WELLER Music by JIM STEINMAN <P> A recent ad in a New York City newspaper contained the following encomium to an R-rated ( " Under 17 re quires accompanying Parent or Adult Guardian " ) film : " Loud/ brassy/ biting/ clever/ fresh/ bold/ glittering/ offbeat/ compelling/ truth/ humor/ devastating/ fun/ hilarious/ murder/ rape/ comedy/ inventive/ caustic/ kinky/ droll/ raw/ jagged/ power/ demolishes . " <P> With the addition of " slapdash " and " ill-timed , " that perfectly describes a new musical called More Than You De serve . Sponsored by Joseph Papp at his lower Manhattan dramatic - arts com plex , the Public Theater , it reflects his le gitimate dismay at the social and polit ical gangrene spread by the Viet Nam War . Unfortunately , it is difficult to transpose the My Lai massacre into a sick South Pacific . Nonetheless , if the hard-rock band does not split a play goer 's skull , some of the farcically outrageous and libidinous goings-on may tickle his ribs .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
