Excuse for Banditry <P> Sir / Heaven help , our country if the Symbionese Liberation Army is allowed to succeed in this terrible Robin Hood effort to force the rich to share with the poor . The Hearst kidnaping is a gross crime and the ransom merely an excuse for a revolutionary group of pitifully misled people to take the law in their own hands . Why ca n't they see the far-reaching effects of their revenge ? Without obedience to law there can be no order or justice in life . <P> MARTHA GROWNEY <P> Roeland Park , Kans . <P> Sir / The appeasement of his daughter 's kidnapers by Randolph Hearst is , in a word , appalling . The example set by the Hearst kidnaping can only result in more of the same . The U.S. : North America 's first banana republic . <P> EDWARD SAXON <P> Kirkwood , Mo . <P> Sir / When dissent becomes barbaric it is the duty of all men , whether they be rich and powerful or poor , hungry and oppressed , to preserve civilized life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true fortitude and humanity by refusing to accept any food or money from the People in Need program or any other criminally sponsored operation . Mr. Hearst and the authorities are powerless to stop this crime , but the people can . <P> JOSEPH W. DAY <P> Palo Alto , Calif . <P> Sir / While not in agreement with kidnaping , violence and threats to the sons and daughters of the rich , I do agree that it is about time someone did something for the poor people of the world . In this day and age , it is beyond all reason for individuals to own vast amounts of money . <P> A law should be passed that no person may have more than $150,000 . Anyone having more should have the money confiscated and used to help the poor of the world . <P> W.A. MORRIS <P> Ottawa <P> Sincerity Is Not Enough <P> Sir / That Vice President Ford is " a politician who projects complete sincerity " Feb. 25 seems a harmless enough statement to me , but I think it somewhat blindly contributes to overlooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to be more pertinent . <P> Mr. Ford is completely sincere about sitting on the fence until somebody who he thinks knows something dislodges him . How sincerely he might make the most likable , ineffectual and dangerous President of them all ! <P> JACK COLLISON <P> Larkspur , Calif . <P> Sir / It looks like the position of U.S. Vice President is due for a new job description . I suggest : liaison official who brings football to the rescue of Government . Expert on defense , any line . <P> JIM NOLAN <P> Guadalajara , Mexico <P> Live Spirit <P> Sir / In reading about Alexander Solzhenitsyn 's present confrontation , I am reminded of Pasternak 's words : " In every generation there has to be some fool who will speak the truth as he sees it . " A prophet has always been considered a fool by his own . Nevertheless a prophet has always been and will always be a spokesman for God or for his people . Would that we all had such fools in our midst ! <P> The Russian spirit still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S.C . <P> Malole , Zambia <P> Postal Rates <P> Sir / I am torn between my dedication to the U.S. Postal Service ( now serving my 27th year in its employ ) and TIME ( as a faithful subscriber for over 20 years ) .
