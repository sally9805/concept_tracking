txt WASHINGTON  --  Assistant Atty . Gen. Barbara Babcock conceded Thursday that she will have to give up her longtime social relationship with a top Washington mob figure , Joe Nesline , for the good of the Justice Department . " One of the burdens of public office , " she told the New York News , " is that you sometimes have to give up longstanding associates . Joe will understand . " Associate Atty . Gen. Michael Egan , apparently reflecting the view of his boss , Atty . Gen. Griffin Bell , would only say when questioned about the Babcock- Justice aide to ' give up ' mobster pal // times " in the year since she joined the Carter administration . But it was not until Jan. 14 that Justice Department officials became aware of her relationship with the longtime gambling kingpin .

Babcock said that she told Bell about her social relationship with Nesline about a week ago and that at the time said she planned to continue to see the gambler . He has not been convicted of a crime in 10 years , she pointed out . Babcock , who has since reconsidered , said perhaps she was " naive " in continuing to associate with Nesline . She was working for the Williams law firm when she defended Nesline and his gambling associate , Charles " The Blade " Tourine , who is reported to have Mafia ties .
