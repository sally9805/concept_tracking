Not yet . When will it be ? And who is she ? First of all , her name is not Phung Ngoc Anh . Not yet . From such a Chinese family , how could it be ? She is named Sut On ( Snow Quiet ) , and from the Ling family , so Ling Sut On , and for most of the years before she was twenty-four , lived in Cholon , in the rooms above her uncle 's go-down .

' " With tha kind of smile on his face , he looks as if he might b , a wandering cloud , and half the enjoyment for hin is throwing them all off and leaving that impression Wu gets the point . though . He puts down his teacup makes a quick bow , and heads down the stairs , hi friends clacking after him like rnah-jongg tiles . Hi attitude is well-known : One  --  you 're not in Canto ; anymore , Old Man . Two  --  I do n't care who you wet there . Three  --  what good did all your study and Con fucius-quoting do you when famine came ?

In Wu 's presence , you could think that First Aunt , Ping , had no tongue at all  --  stolen by the fox-fairies maybe . She is silent and sweet-faced as she bends down in her cheongsam to give him things , and always cooing with her children , but as soon as Wu is out of the room , and especially when he takes his old secondhand Renault and goes out buying rice in the Delta , Ping begins shrieking , and for all her concern with perfection , suddenly does n't even care how much she offends her husband 's father . " It 's my house , " is one of her favorite beginnings . " Everything here is mine , and when we move , even if we let you stay here , you would be left with nothing . " And another one : " When we move , even if we let you visit us , you would n't know what to do . " " And the goat ? " says Sut On 's mother , very familiar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you take him ? " It 's not much of an argument , though , because everything in the house does belong to Wu , goat included , but he is a miser and would never move . Besides , who would watch the go-down ? Not his sickly brother Lim , who also lives upstairs with his whiny wife and children and can not even watch what he says or to whom he says it , so busy is he darting around in his leather cap and dreaming up schemes for anyplace else  --  Hanoi , Macao , Bangkok . Nor would Wu trust Sut On 's father  --  a man who could not even properly take his wife to his own home . This is what makes it so hard on Sut On 's mother , who is in any case practically a barren woman : two sons stillborn , and another one so puny he did not last a month . Of course , there is Sut On , hilt she is only a gill , and naturally there are people ( one of them Sut On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of country has women for heroes , keeps up statues of women who drove off invaders mounted on elephants ? But Sut On 's mother never gives up , goes to fortunenellers constantly , and every morning before she sets out rice cakes and tea ( while French ladies are having coffee and long hot rolls 1 , she lights her joss stick and prays to Kwan Yin . With no sons , Sut On 's father could take another wife if he wanted , but this is impossible to imagine . Once , in the time of the Japanese , he ran a public letter-writing stall , but for as long as she can remember , her dim , red-eared father has always worked for her uncle and usually smoked enough opium pipes to not even know who she is . If anyone spilled tea on him , he would n't feel it . So no one pays attention to him , least of all her mother , who never suspected how lowly she had married , and there is no respect for him in this house . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly as if he were one of the Forty-seven Beasts , he is forced out of his thinness and quiet , and above all the usual racket , even over explosions or bombs , he begins to scream and stamp his feet , cursing in peasant Cantonese that Sut On can not even understand . Which one of the Forty-seven Beasts is what she tries to figure out when this happens . For instance : there once was a man who spent all his days and nights in wickedness and unbelief . His family pleaded with him , his friends argued and cajoled , his neighbors warned him , but it was all useless , for in his arrogance he would not change his ways . Suddenly , in the middle of his life , he was overtaken by a strange and mysterious illness : for ten years , he would neither speak , receive visitors , nor move from his bed . His son , who was dutiful , hovered by his father 's doorstep , and finally one day heard the old man call for a bundle of hay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly was the door now shut again , for to the poor obedient son 's horror , he saw that his father had been turned into an ox . Or another one : in a village , a farmer known for his idleness and covetousness , one night stole into the yard of his friend and neighbor , and in the false glow of darkness , came away with his neighbor 's most prized duck . Swaggering in the moonlight , he cooked the duck that very night , ate it , and later in the midst of his sleep , felt his skin begin to itch . In the morning , his body was covered with a thick growth of duck 's feathers , so painful that he cried out . " Quack , " came the farmer 's voice in his agony : he had been turned into a duck . I F SUT ON WERE A FRENCH GIRL , she would not hake to listen to such scenes of stamping and cursing ; they would not happen , and if through some accident they ever did , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous silver spigots known to shine through French villas , and in the rush of French water , drown out all the noise . How does Sut On know so much about what happens in French houses ? In a roundabout way , the answer is her grandfather , and in an even more roundabout way , it 's certain big-time Cholon merchants , much richer than Wu , so much richer , in fact , that when they appear at the house unexpected , it sends Wu running up and down screaming orders and bumping tea-things . By mistake , he even bowed at a no-good friend of sickly Lim 's , whom he had forbidden to ever come back . This is the perfect situation for Ping who is always waiting for the time her smiling smug ways would get a deserving reception . But it 's not Wu these whispering , dark-suited merchants have come to see . Instead , it 's Sut On 's grandfather  --  whose reputation they have not forgotten , whose words and even name , because he was once their teacher , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life-span depends on his uprightness , ' " says Sut On 's grandfather immediately . Naturally , they are up to something . Why waste time ? " ' He who goes on living without it escapes disaster only by good fortune . ' " " My grandfather was a Imre , " Sut On would say later on in her school years , simply to make an impression , because otherwise she was ashamed of her household . But in much later years and in a very different place , this old misused sentence came back to her head with a certain surprise . The merchants leave without even saying goodbye to Wu . This is the reason for their visit : they have managed to secure an extra place for a Chinese child in the French school , and they wish to honor their old teacher by offering it to him , for one of his grandchildren . Sut On 's grandfather is very pleased ? not so much by the offer , but because they remembered to quote for him from Feng Kui-fen : " There are many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can learn from the barbarians and surpass them . " Wu is furious , he stalks around and can not even go back to his abacus . What does he care about French schools ? The richest men in Cholon have been in his house , drunk his tea , have come and gone as if he were nonexistent . If they truly want to honor his father , then help make the old man 's life more prosperous and comfortable by entering into business arrangements with the son . But Ping sees it differently : " Think of Chen . When he goes to the French school , he 'll be able to help his father " ; and because Wu is still fuming , children on the floor are crying , and Chen , a loping , sneaky boy is nowhere around , Ping shrieks out in an unwifely voice , " Chen ! Find Chen ! It 's his grandfather who wants him . " " Do they think 1 have no ability ? " says Wu . " Do they think my contacts in the Delta would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't find Chen immediately , " Ping screams at all the other children , " you are disobey . lug your grandfather ! " Lim 's listless friend , who has taken off his shirt , yawns very loudly , the goat rings his bell in the back , and Sut On 's grandfather , who does not at this moment look like a wandering cloud at all , says , " It 's time for my walk with Sut On . " T FEIHERE IS NOTHING AT ALL UNUSUAL about Sut On 's grandfather taking her out for a walk . It 's been a habit of his for years , and rarely is the walk itself very different . For years , he has held her hand and walked slowly through the different streets in Cholon , only speeding up a bit or ducking into an alley when he sees the face of someone he does not respect and would rather avoid . Occasionally they go along the docks and this is the only part Sut On does not like : the coolies , wearing no shirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to themselves peasant Cantonese curses , just as her father does in the times when he is angry . Her grandfather does not allow her to look away , but because he knows she does not like it , Ile buys her a slice of pineapple or a fruit drink to suck on . Usually , though , they walk slowly through the streets and the stalls and he tells her about his life in his village in Canton , which even her parents have never seen , tells her stories from ancient China , and sometimes when he thinks of it , recites pieces of poems . What she likes best is the story of Chuang Tzu , who was a philosopher , a real person , but was never sure of it . One night he dreamed he was a butterfly , and when he woke up he could n't decide whether he was Chuang Tzu who had dreamed he was a butterfly , or whether instead he was really a butterfly who kept on dreaming he was Chuang Tzu . " Is it I , Chuang Tzu ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to this part of the story , and thinking about it now . Sut On is about to ask het grandfather to tell it to her again , but he is holding her hand more tightly , and walking along so quickly that they are no longer even in Cholon , but in Saigon itself where Vietnamese live , and there are no more signs in Chinese . " Look very carefully , Sut On , " her grandfather says , and being in a strange place , how can she do otherwise ? She hardly knows any Vietnamese , having lived in Cholon all her life , and always gone to a Chinese school . Once , in one of his strange , unpredictable fits of anger , her father knocked down a Vietnamese policeman . leaving him sprawled out right on the street . Probably he had said something against the Chinese or looked at her father in a way that made him think so , but since it had happened in Cholon , even though there were many people watching , naturally it had all come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just an extra reminder of how she lived in shame . Sut On looks around her and knows what she will never be : a lithe Annamese girl , pretty in an an dai . Her bones are too broad , her legs are too heavy , and even if she ever put on an ao dai and got accustomed to the material , just above it her face would be a dead giveaway  --  she will always look Chinese . That 's not what her grandfather has in mind , though . " They have nothing , " he says , and will not even look at all the Vietnamese who crowd through the street . " No Empire , no culture , no language , no energy . They could n't even keep their alphabet , which in any case , was really ours . What do they have that is n't borrowed ? " and walking along in his long Mandarin coat and his beard , Sut On 's grandfather does not dodge around trishaws or pedicabs , but passes right by them as if they were shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't : they have walked so far , Sut On and her grandfather , that by this time there arc no more trishaws or bicycles , only Frenchmen in cars . Their eyes blink too much against the sunlight , their feet seem stuck as they push them , in big shoes , along the street . " I 've never told you this story before , Sut On , " her grandfather says . But she 's in no mood for a story . No other street is so wide and so shiny , no other street has no markets or stalls . Instead , people walk in and out of glass-covered stores wearing the same kind of clothing that stares out from the glass . With their very pink faces . they climb to the top of high-windowed buildings , and when they get tired of being so high , they come down to the street , tip back in strange chairs , and unfolding their newspapers , they sip cups of coffee and do n't suck their gums . Not one of them knows enough to hold a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in big white houses hidden by gardens . where maybe occasionally they take off their wide shoes . Even their little children have pink faces and red and yellow hair , and when they take rides on airplanes do not come home to goats . What story can have come to her grandfather 's mind ? Heng 0 , the Monn lady ? The Sisters in the Sun ? How the Eight Old Ones Crossed the Sea ? What on this street could make him think of any of them ? " A hunter went into the woods and in them found a young deer , a faun so lovely that he could not kill her . Instead , he brought her back with him to his home , and let her play there within his yard . At first , he worried that his dogs would attack the shy creature , so different from themselves . But it was not so . For months on end the fawn played and frolicked with the dogs in his yard , and grew up with them sowell that the hunter saw no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , when the gate to his yard was open , the deer ventured forth and seeing some dogs in the distance , she scampered up to play with them . But these were strange dogs who had never seen a deer before . They tore her up from limb to limb and that is the end of her story . For so long a time had she lived with dogs . she no longer knew she was not one of them . " " T 've never even seen a fawn , " Sut On says , though she 's never made this objection to stories about fox-fairies . But they 're no longer on the Rue Catinat now , so she skips on the streets that are increasingly familiar , and her grandfather buys her a slice of pineapple . " A deer is a fleet animal , " he says very carefully : it is Sut On who will go to the French school . " Draw Your Own Conclusions " IN FRENCH BOOKS , the paper is very glossy . Touch- ling it , in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl who comes home each day to a room above a go-down in Chalon , or even a strangely pink-faced girl whose mother in thin , high-heeled shoes plays tennis ai the Cercle Sportif and thinks nothing of walking in and out of shops on the Rue Catinat . Instead , she is someone named Franeoise or perhaps Solange , whose face she can not quite imagine , but whose feet take her along broad , tree-lined boulevards , broader than any in Saigon , and down into underground trains where people around her sit down politely with armfuls of long thin breads . Sometimes this Francoise or Solange takes her small dog , Coco , for a walk into gardens called the Tuileries . She is totally unfamiliar with goats , though sometimes in August she and her family  --  moustached , firm-voiced father , smiling mother , and perhaps a small brother named JeanClaude  --  take trips in a car which they own , past farms to the countryside . Here , there are animals , maybe even a goat , but Francoise or Solange occupies herself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a perfect French accent about a shepherdess , all the while she is picking cherries and dropping them one , two , three into a basket . She is very careful to avoid picking any mushrooms , and when it is time for a meal . eats veal in a sauce of wine and butter , and potatoes that have been cut up thin and fried . Never in her life has she tasted bean curd , and if she saw a lichee nut , she would n't know what to do with it . " She 'll grow up to be a taxi-girl , " Ping shrieks whenever she sees Sot On in her smock , carrying home her schoolbooks and writing out her lessons . It 's the one thing Ping ever learned from Chinese literature : educated girls may bring great pleasure to men , even Emperors , but never , never are they marriageable . Sut On 's mother pays no attention to this , goes on pouring out her many cups of tea as usual , and worries only that her daughter , almost grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everyday smells . Because of this , Ping has begun to call her Madame Oo-la-la , and still rails to Wu about his father , " How can he have shown such preference ? He must have been as blind and deaf then as he is now . " He 's not truly deaf yet , Sut On 's grandfather , but he is blind enough so that it 's very difficult for him to read . Instead of taking walks together , Sut On reads out to him from old issues of a Chinese newspaper whose office has been bombed . Luckily he can not tell that these are articles which he 's heard before , and is pleased enough with Slit On 's blurry presence and the rising and falling of her voice as she reads . After his death , when his picture  --  taken so far back in his youth that Sut On does not even recognize him  --  is hanging on the ancestral altar , her mother says , " He was a very fair man , your grandfather . He had no illusions about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion , was there to have illusions about ? There are things about her , though , which he has never known . First , her greatest mistake at the French school : a picture in drawing class . The drawing was in honor of Christmas , a feast day celebrating peacefulness and serene joy . Sut On drew a great-winged bird flying slowly from high mountains to a quiet pond . All around her , other children drew a fat , bearded man , Pere Noel , or a pink , yellow-haired baby surrounded by donkeys . The French girls laughed aloud , the Vietnamese girls looked at each other and giggled , the drawing teacher tore up her paper . Sut On looked up at the drawing teacher : blond and doughy , his face looked like a countryside in a European child 's picture book  --  the sheep on hills in French nursery rhymes . So , once again Sut On drew a picture for the joyful holiday  --  a pink , yellow-haired baby , and put him right next to a goat . " Do you live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes . " My parents like to go there to eat Chinese food . Do you walk all the way ? " Sut On walks all the way , she has never tired of it . No longer a small child on the arm of her grandfather , there are streets in Saigon she has gotten to know as well as Cholon . These days , though , there are almost no French girls left in her classes , and the Vietnamese girls who once giggled at her drawing , hop into their brothers ' sportscars , wearing sunglasses and giggling still . This time they 're off to Vung Tau , to the seashore . Perhaps soon they 'll go to Paris or even America . In the meantime , they buy new scarves , look through Paris-Match , and watch the American secretaries whose hairdos , incredibly , rise up like so many new buildings : floors and floors of immovable , perfect curls . Sut On will not go to Paris , nor to the university at Hue as she had wished . In the room above heruncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , Lim sucks his gums with his cap on , the goat rings his bell in the yard . If she takes this teacup from her mother 's hands , it will not rest between her fingers , but fling itself in all directions : like a dragon or one of the Forty-seven Beasts , there is nothing that it will not smash . " A Secret Base in Cu Chi " N ARRATOR : " THE VILLAGE OF QUOC TRI , once a place of cheer and hardy , joyous activity found itself suddenly plunged , through no fault of its own , into one of lassitude and woe . No longer did the sultry winds whistle through the green and gold stalks a happy , continuous melody as busy as the chirping of crickets . It was not floods which were drowning the crops and sturdy spirits of the villagers , but great sheets of fire and flame , falling from the skies which ruthlessly consumed , sparing nothing : neither fields , nor homes , nor sons . The villagers who remained could not contain their puzzlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The women wept and wailed over the loss of those most dear , and the men , sunk in anger and sorrow , did not know what there was to be done , nor what indeed was the cause of this terrible misfortune . As they sat , still tormented by grief and astonishment , soldiers appeared amidst the ruins . From their speech and appearance . the villagers could ascertain that these soldiers were Southerners like themselves , and rushed out to greet them with hope innocent in their hearts . Alas ! Neither hope nor innocence lasted beyond that instant . The soldiers , as rude and ruthless as the flames themselves , gave no heed to the cries of their countrymen . Cruelty flickered on their features and they swooped through the desolated village , ravishing its young daughters , torturing its revered Elders and temporary Chief . But still they had not contented themselves . for they began to vie with each other in wringing the necks of the few miserable , squawking chickens scratching mournfully about in the scorched yards . These they carried off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were labeled U.S.A. And finally the villagers understood ! These soldiers were the puppet troops of a usurper government , and the sheets of flame , the cause of their misfortune , did not fall from the skies , but were thrown upon them by giant planes flown from the country of Hollywood . " What has happened to Francoisc or Solange ? And where , for that matter , is Sut On ? Called Anh now , she is wearing black trousers still strange to her , and standing to the side , watching , as a small theatrical troupe performs a pageant for the villagers . It is an NLF holiday , so members from her base which is close to the village have come with the troupe to celebrate . It 's not the first time she 's been in a village like this one : years before , when Wu drove out to buy rice , Sut On and Chen occasionally went along . Chen would lope along with his father , but Sut On almost never got out of the car . Sitting in it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she would look out the windows , closed against mosquitoes , and staring at the red-tiled roofs behind small palm trees , at the little orchards of mangoes and jackfruits , and above all , at a certain slow quietness so different from Cholon , she would wish that she was one of the small girls she could see running barefoot past the monkeys , sucking on a piece of cane or perhaps a coconut . She looks no more like them now than she did then : it 's girls like these she 's met at Cu Chi , girls to whose bodies black trousers are not strange , girls who have run barefoot for miles and miles through wild panther country , and think nothing of it . Bits of rice and nuoc-mam are what they 're used to , and jungle sounds at night do not make them jump . Their Vietnamese is so quick she can barely understand it . Naturally she is still not trusted . The troupe is finishing up , waiting for the musi. cians . They sing with a guitar : An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpless against determination ! Sut On is still watching a small-boned girl from the troupe , a dancer , who played out with slow , huddled movements the grief of a widow . The sadness , which just minutes before crept and bent through all of her , is gone now , transformed . She stands up straight , and in a plain cotton blouse her mother might have worn in the Viet Minh , is singing with all of them , " helpless against determina-tion ! " " Other women bring forth children , you bring forth rifles , " said the official who arrested Ho ' 5 sister in the days of the Viet Minh . Her father was a lettre . " My grandfather was a lettrt , " says Slit On that night , when they are back at Cu Chi , far beneath foliage . In the darkness especially , the feeling of holiday persists : there are coconuts and an orange or two from the village , and some of the younger boys are strumming on guitars . But Sin On is impatient with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain to herself , she pushes a guitar out of someone 's hands , and in her high Chinese voice  --  she hears her accent but does n't care  --  begins to sing : Dors mon amour Fais do-do mon tresor On crie chez la voisine Chez nous une ceiline To se trainer darns la fange Tu ens dons la sole Dans la robe d'un ange recaMe pour toi . The song is from Mother Courage , a record Sut On once found hidden behind books in the French school . Dors mon amour Fais do-do mon. tresor L'un repose en Pulogne Et l'autre je ne . sais " Why are you singing a French song ? " says the cadre . He is a wiry man , quick , nimble , and for that reason called Squirrel . No one 's name is their own . Why is she singing a ' Tench song ? For a second , in her headiness . Sut On thinks she will tell Squirrel about Mother Courage , about the Thirty Years War , but is afraid that just like with machine-gun fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too slow , her thoughts are going so quickly her voice would make no sense . " It 's a lullaby , " she says and , looking at him directly , knows perfectly well that was not the way she sang it . The cadre begins tapping rapidly on a bamboo length he has sharpened . In his staccato Northern voice , he says , " You should not stay in the jungle any longer . " " A Red Scarf and a Blue Scarf and Two Wigs " T HERE IS NO STREET IN CHOLON , no house , no door , no stand , no stall that Sut On could not find in her sleep . It is in fact this feeling of sleep that stays with her now as she walks through the market in a short wig and a Western dress , seeing no one and smiling dimly , politely at hawkers who , noticing a stranger , shout out elevated prices in broken Vietnamese . She could tear off her wig , pull out her voice , and scream and haggle with them in Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways ; nothing even seems familiar , so she walks on , with her sunglasses , to a certain teashop where she picks up instructions . In front of it , there is a row of old women who are selling radios and cameras in cartons marked PX . One of them suddenly looks up at her and in a hoarse , tired voice calls out in Chinese  --  it is not her mother . Inside , the message is more or less what she has been expecting : " The mountains around you do not have higher peaks than the one on which you already stand ! There is no going back . " In the bare Cholon apartment rented to Miss Phung Ngoc Anh , Sut On lights a joss stick , and in its old , missed smell folds and unfolds the scarves , staring at the red and blue squares in the dark room . Over and over again , she turns them inside out and around and smooths down the edges ; it 's as if they were someone else 's , she has never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue ? " she says , and feels like giggling , so much does she want to pretend that this is her dilemma . Asleep On the straw mat which belongs to the apartment , she dreams that her grandfather is walking through the long narrow halls of her uncle 's go-down . He is coming to greet her , but does not call out her name or even beckon to her . He just keeps on walking slowly with a slice of pineapple held out in his hands . " There is no going back . " To what would Phung Ngoc Anh go back ? There is a girl with a flowing red scarf who speeds through the streets on the back of a motorcycle . If her heart is remote , she 'd be the last one to know it . Fleet as a fawn , she shoots with both hands . ?
