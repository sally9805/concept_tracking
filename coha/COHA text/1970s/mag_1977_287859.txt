" We 're just sitting on our asses , " Jimmy Carter barked into his Oval Office telephone . On the receiving end , Vice President Walter Mondale listened patiently . Though both men had been in their jobs for less than three months at the time , the President was irate that few new U.S. initiatives toward Africa had been undertaken . Within several days , he sent U.N . Ambassador Andrew Young and Mondale winging their way , verbally and physically , through the continent , where they followed the Carter policy of denouncing white racism and supporting black majority rule . <P> The incident illustrates several facts about the way the Administration shapes foreign policy . First , the President is firmly in charge of it . Second , he is impatient in his determination to influence world events , sometimes moves swiftly before all the ramifications of the action are thoroughly explored . Third , he relies on several officials , rather than a single Kissinger-like superstar , to carry out his ideas . <P> Each Friday morning when all are in town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski and Secretary of State Cyrus Vance , as well as Mondale . The Big Four linger over coffee for up to two hours as they mull over an agenda of issues prepared by Vance . <P> Most of the topics are of immediate concern , such as the trips this week of Vance to the Middle East and Young to the Caribbean . Yet the four attempt to keep a broader perspective . Says one participant : " We try to look down the road to where we hope to be four years from now . " <P> A secondary quartet of foreign policymakers consists of Young , Defense Secretary Harold Brown , Arms Control Director Paul Warnke and CIA Director Stansfield Turner . The two circles overlap in ways that increase consultation and give and take . Brown , for example , lunches each week with Brzezinski and Vance , and he is highly regarded in the White House , says one official there , as " a lot more than just a spokesman for the generals and the military-industrial complex . " The outspoken Young has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close heed to his opinions and has no regrets about the way Young has publicly expressed them . Warnke 's incisive views on arms control have far more impact than has been usual for an arms negotiator . <P> Beyond all this high-level and often informal chatter , there is a formal policy machinery that is also put to full use . Under Vance , the State Department bureaucracy is far more a part of the action than it was under either Secretary of State William Rogers or Kissinger . Vance asks not only Warnke to sit in whenever he discusses arms control with Soviet Ambassador Anatoli Dobrynin , but Leslie Gelb , who heads the department 's Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs , is also deeply involved in SALT . No steps in Carter 's troop-reduction plans for Korea are taken without consulting Richard Holbrooke , Assistant Secretary for East Asia and Pacific Affairs . The longtime career diplomats at State also have more influence . Philip Habib , Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs , is with Vance in the Middle East , and will accompany him later to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Assistant Secretary for European Affairs and is significantly helping to coordinate Soviet-American relations .
