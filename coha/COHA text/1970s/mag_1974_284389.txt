Like nearly every other year for the past 50 or so , 1974 has been a bad time for royalty . Not only did Greek voters reject King Constantine , but a military junta ousted Ethiopia 's venerable ( 82 ) Emperor Haile Selassie . Sooner rather than later , it seems , history will bear out the bitter bon mot of Egypt 's King Farouk , who himself was forced to abdicate in 1952 . In a few years , said Farouk , there will be only five kings in the world : the King of England and the four in the deck of cards . <P> Actually , most ex-Kings and claimants to nonexistent thrones live better than their ex-subjects . Spain and Portugal seem to be the favorite spots of exile , with Switzerland a close third . Albania 's Leka I , Bulgaria 's Simeon II and Russia 's Grand Duke Vladimir-who presumably would be enthroned as Czar Vladimir III if the Romanovs were ever restored to power-live in Spain . Italy 's Umberto II , Spain 's Don Juan and Portugal 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Switzerland , there are Michael of Rumania and Ahmed-Fuad II of Egypt ( Farouk 's eldest son ) , while Otto von Hapsburg , the heir to the Austro-Hungarian empire who now calls himself Dr. Hapsburg , lives in West Germany and writes and lectures . The leading claimant to the French throne , Henri d'Orlans , the Count of Paris , lives in the country that , but for history , he might have ruled . Even Brazil shelters a would-be monarch : Alexander II of Yugoslavia , whose father , the deposed King Peter , died of pneumonia in California in 1970 . <P> Some of the royals have gone to work . Prince Louis Murat , whose great-great-great grandfather briefly ruled the kingdom of Naples in Napoleon 's day , is president of Compagnie Ferguson Morrison-Knudsen , a Paris-based subsidiary of America 's Morrison-Knudsen Co. , while Michael of Rumania is a stockbroker in Lausanne . Some live off the money they or their family got out of the country . Others , like Italy 's Umberto , manage very well with the help of monarchist friends who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a sense of nostalgia . <P> Almost all have given up hopes of returning . Don Juan and Umberto still hold shadow court in Portugal 's Estoril , but more as a gesture to the past than a look to the future . Albania 's Leka and Bulgaria 's Simeon , on the other hand , still work for the day when their people will come to their senses and call them back . The only one who seems to have a real chance of resuming the kingly tradition , however , is Don Juan 's son Prince Juan Carlos , who has been promised the Spanish throne on the death of Generalissimo Francisco Franco .
