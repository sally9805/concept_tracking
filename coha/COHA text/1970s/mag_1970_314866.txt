Israel is involved in a war of attrition with four neighbors-Egypt , Jordan , Syria and Lebanon-that confront it on three sides . When all the fronts are active , life can be hectic for the Israelis . Last week was such an occasion . <P> Aside from acts of sabotage by terrorists within Israel , there were exchanges of fire along the Suez Canal that killed two Israeli soldiers and wounded eleven . Israeli commandos also staged a swift raid on Egyptian units across the canal , and reported killing eight men while losing two . Israeli regulars and Arab guerrillas fought a series of skirmishes along Israel 's border with both Lebanon and Syria . Israel admitted suffering two dead and 13 wounded but claimed seven more enemy casualties . Twice on the Jordanian front , Israelis spotted guerrilla ambushes and broke them up with shellfire . <P> As if four foes were not enough , Israel may soon have to worry about a reinvigorated fifth . Iraq has no contiguous border with Israel , but its fanatically anti-Israel Baathist government maintains an 18,000-man expeditionary force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more troops but for the fact that the Iraqi army has been preoccupied for nearly nine years with rebellious Kurd tribesmen . The Kurds , who occupy most of the northern quarter of Iraq with an army of 10,000 men , have been demanding autonomy . Last week , convinced that the endless war was futile , Lieut . General Ahmed Hassan Bakr , Iraq 's President , granted the country 's 1,500,000 Kurds most of what they wanted . <P> Under terms of the agreement , the Kurds will govern their own territory and send delegates to the next Parliament . The Kurdish language will enjoy official status along with Arabic . " This is no temporary armistice , " said Bakr . " This is a complete political and constitutional settlement of all existing problems , and it will prevail forever . " In Iraq , forever may not mean all it appears to . A 1966 truce between the government and Kurds proved short-lived when Baghdad reneged on its promises . <P> If the settlement lasts , however , Israel may be in for more trouble . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government can now mobilize " Iraq 's entire potential for the battle of Palestine . "
