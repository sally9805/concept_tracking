To most Americans , Gerald R. Ford is a commoner of uncommon candor , an Everyman struggling manfully with the job of President . To Reporter Richard Reeves , Ford is " slow , unimaginative and not very articulate " - and none too candid either . In A Ford , Not a Lincoln ( Harcourt Brace Jovanovich ; $8.95 ) , a new and widely discussed account of Ford 's first 100 days , Reeves calls Ford 's rise to the presidency " a triumph of **25;5039;TOOLONG politics , the survival of the man without enemies , the least objectionable alternative . " He adds : " The President of the U.S. is just another pol . " <P> <P> Reeves , 38 , a contributing editor of New York magazine , is not just another political reporter . In a journalistic specialty known for apple polishing , he has made his way by following the old maxim that the best way for a reporter to look upon a politician is , as a misanthropic editor once said , " down . " " I do have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't feel any great obligation to recount their many and varied personal and professional virtues . That is what they , or the taxpayers , are paying for in the salaries and fees of press secretaries , media advisers and advertising agencies . " He picked up his fond contempt for politicos from the fetid municipal air of Jersey City , where he grew up as the son of a county judge . " There were two groups of politicians there , " Reeves recalls , " those who sold out and those who went to jail . " <P> At first avoiding politics , he studied engineering at Hoboken 's Stevens Institute of Technology , graduated in 1960 and worked days as an engineer , nights as editor of a local weekly .

He wrote for both Harper 's and New York , lectured at a local university , did consulting work for the Ford Foundation , was a host for a local TV talk show and took on a syndicated radio program-a regimen that brought him $75,000 a year . <P> Reeves began interviewing the first of 150 sources for his book after Ford became Vice President , then followed him to the White House , interrogating aides at their homes and reading mountains of documents . Says he : <P> " My eyes went blooey and my back hurt . " Reeves had occasionally talked with Ford , but never asked for a formal interview after he became President . " His reactions to questions in other interviews seemed pat , " Reeves says . " I did n't think he would be of any value to me. "
