Even the most casual observer of our American democracy will have noticed the predominance of in herited wealth . Fewer will understand why this is so . Elaborate theories of monopoly capital have evolved , but a simpler explanation is an obscure loophole in the Internal Revenue Code . We are not referring to the legerdemain by which expensive lawyers make a farce of the federal estate tax . We are not even referring to the favored tax treatment given to all capital gains . We are referring to the ability of our richest citizens to escape any tax at all on the growth of their fortunes . The tax reform act of 1976 began the process of closing what may be the largest loophole in the tax code . The 1978 tax bill reopened it , in an amendment tacked on at 3 a.m. the day the 95th Congress adjourned in October . Pleasantly enough for those who lobbied it through , this special favor for inherited wealth got almost no attention in the press during the confusion of the last hours , even though it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in capital gains taxes . It was a remarkable display of the power of the moneyed elite , taking advantage of the fealty of legislators and the ignorance of journalists . The arrangement is not all that complex . It has to do with the way capital gains are measured for tax purposes . When you buy , say , a piece of real estate or a share of stock for $2000 , then sell it a few years later for $ 5 000 , you have made a profit . The tax code says you have " realized " a " capital gain , " which is less clear but more desirable since your taxes will be a lot less as a result of these strange terms . How much is your gain ? It is the difference between what you paid ? your " basis " ? and what you sold it for . In this case it is $ 3 000 . Before actually paying any taxes you start deducting left and right , but that is not our sermon today . Our concern is what happens if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflection will suggest that this is a frequent occurrence . The deceaseddiscovered lying on a mattress stuffed with dollar bills is not a common phenomenon , and becomes less common the higher one moves up the scale of wealth . Those with access to sound legal and accounting advice are likely to die owning stocks and bonds , racehorses and real estate , rather than cash . ( Or , to put it another way , owning banks rather than bank accounts . ) The law before 1976 said that if you died owning assets that had appreciated in value , that appreciation was wiped out for tax purposes . Your heirs paid taxes only on the appreciation that occurred after your death . So , for example , if that stock , purchased for $2000 , was worth $5000 when you died , and $6000 when your heir sold it , your heir would have to pay taxes on a capital gain of only $1000. in the language of tax lawyers , your death " stepped up " the " basis " from $2000 , the price you paid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain of $3000 that occurred before your death escaped taxation completely . This is not a trivial technicality . The government loses more revenue because of the stepped-up basis rule than it brings in from all the capital gains that are taxed . The Treasury Department estimates that every year $20 billion of investment profits escape taxation forever because of this rule . This tax-free $20 billion is not spread evenly across the citizenry . It is not spread evenly across that fraction of the citizenry that enjoys investment profits . It is not even spread evenly across that small fraction of investors who die leaving large estates . Most of the benefit goes to those with fortunes large enough to set aside large chunks of appreciated property for their heirs . In 1972 the average estate of under $100,000 had $444 of untaxed appreciation , while the average estate of over one million dollars had almost a million dollars in untaxed appreciation . The effect of the stepped-up basis rule is to permit great fortunes to grow from one generation to the next while escaping even the reduced taxation the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two simple ways to shut this loophole . The simplest is to tax the accrued gain at death , before passing the asset on to the heirs . An alternative is to make people who sell inherited assets pay tax on the whole profit since the asset was purchased and not just the part that accrued after they inherited it . This is called the " carryover basis " rule , and it already applies to gifts . If I buy stock for $2000 and give it to you when it 's worth $5000 , your " basis " is what I paid ? $2000 . If you sell it when it 's worth $6000 , you must pay taxes on $4000 of gain , not just the $1000 that 's accrued since I gave it to you . In 1976 Congress adopted a version of the carryover basis rule for inherited property . It would have required heirs to pay taxes on all increases in the value of property after January 1 , 1977 . The contributions of past generations to large family fortunes would remain tax-free , but those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . The 1976 law included a $70,000 exemption , which means it would n't even affect 93 percent of those who die leaving property . Immediately a campaign began to repeal the change . The lobbying was led by the associations of tax and probate lawyers , accountants , timber growers and farmers . ( Farmers made the usual plea about saving family farms , although the tax of course would not affect any family farm until it was sold . ) Taking advantage of the reactionary momentum of the 95th Congress and the confusion of the pre-adjournment tax bill battle , they won a three-year postponement of the carryover basis rule . Those millionaires farsighted enough to have died since January 1 , 1977 will escape its sting , and Congress has until January 1 , 1980 to decide whether to let the rule be reinstated . Senator Harry Byrd of Virginia is leading the fight for repeal and plans hearings this spring . House Ways and Means Chairman Al Ullman and the Carter administration claim to be adamant that there should be some taxation of investment profits that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exemption to $175,000 , which would limit the sting to only two percent of those who die with any estate . Even so , there will be a tough battle : this is the two percent that really counts . The spoken argument against the carryover basis is that it is too complex . It is indeed complex , but so is the whole tax code and so are the affairs of anyone who leaves an estate of more than $175,000 . Almost all the complexities could be avoided by the more radical step of taxing capital gains at death , but the lawyers and accountants of the wealthy do not find this option appealing . The Senate Budget Committee estimates that this change ( and a similar change in the taxation of large gifts ) would bring the federal government almost $10 billion in fiscal 1980 , the budget President Carter is eagerly chopping right now . This amount is more than the government collects on all capital gains under current rules . The stepped-up basis rule takes up just a few lines in that majestic document , the Internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an almost im ? penetrable web of strange phrases , numbers and cross-references . Nothing you 'd curl up with by the fire . But when read with patience and a little imagination , it opens up into a revealing portrait of our society , as panoramic as a Dickens novel ( and as cynical as Evelyn Waugh ) . It is enlightening , for example , to compare the treatment the tax laws provide to inherited wealth with the treatment they give to the savings of ordinary people . We have one character , let us call him Rockefeller , who has started out rich and , through skillful invest ? ment advice , has become even richer . He has invested in stocks , in fine art , in real estate . All these things grow more valuable and so Rockefeller grows richer , but he is not taxed on any of them until he sells them . When he sells one of these items , he does n't have to pay any tax on 60 percent of his profit , because it is called a capital gain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generosity of the 95th Congress . ) If he is so rich that he can avoid selling these appreciated assets during his life , he wins the really big prize : the angel of death comes along to " step up " the " basis , " and the profits of a lifetime escape tax forever . Another character in our drama is Aunt Millie . She has a widow 's mite of a few thousand dollars . She can not afford investment advice , but she has seen those public service advertisements informing the citizenry that investing in United States savings bonds is both prudent and patriotic . So she takes the plunge . For her trouble , she gets six percent , compounded biannually . She , too , pays no taxes until she redeems the bonds . But when she does cash in , she gets no capital gains deduction . In effect , she has to pay two and a half times as much tax on her savings bond profit as she would if it were considered a capital gain . And what happens if she cashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no stepped-up basis for US savings bonds . When her heirs redeem the bonds , they must pay taxes on all the interest that has accumulated since the day Aunt Millie bought them . Finally , we have old Joe , Aunt Millie 's handyman . He does not make enough money to worry about investment , but he tries to sock away a few dollars every week in a savings account at the local bank . The federal government 's first contribution to old Joe 's finances is to forbid the bank to pay him more than five percent interest on his savings . ( The bank does not object . ) Next , the government finds out from the bank how much interest Joe has received every year , and every April Joe must go down to the bank and remove enough money to pay his taxes on that year 's gain . Rockefeller and Aunt Millie can keep investing not only their own share of each year 's profits , but the government 's share as well , until they cash in their investments . Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six percent . Joe must subtract the government 's share from his five percent each year and then reinvest what 's left . Over the years , it makes a big difference . The " deferral " effect ( as it is called ) enjoyed by Rockefeller and Aunt Millie amounts to an interest-free loan from the government . And of course Joe gets no capital gains deduction , so he pays two and a half times as much tax . And there are no taxes for his heirs to escape when he dies , because he has paid them all as he went along . A real tear-jerker , is n't it ? Since Congress closed the tax shelter for money-losing film investments in 1976 , it 's no longer reasonable to hope for a movie based on the Internal Revenue Code . But if only to restore their own self-esteem , the authors should rewrite the script . After meeting with Jimmy Carter at the White House last September 22 , senators Alan Cranston of Califor ? nia and Herman Talmadge of Georgia told a staff assistant who motored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed them during a discussion of pending veterans pension legislation . Cranston is chairman and Talmadge is the ranking Democratic member of the Senate Committee on Veterans ' Affairs . They and their opposites on the House veterans committee had been trying to work out a conference compromise on increased pension levels . Carter had summoned the chief Senate and House conferees to the White House to tell them what he would and would n't accept and what he expected in the way of pension reforms . Cranston and Talmadge said that Carter had mastered the details of a complex subject , that he had made his expectations . and requirements clear and that he had dealt skillfully with his visitors . He had never mentioned " veto . " He had said that he knew they would act " responsibly " and that if they did he would sign the pension bill Congress sent him . Congress sent him a bill that was costly but less costly than either the original House or Senate versions would have been . It included the reforms that he most wanted , mainly narrowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that veterans and survivors in equal circumstances be treated equally . On October 18 Carter signed a related bill , sponsored by Cranston , that increased the levels of compensation to veterans with service-connected disabilities ? a benefit distinct from pensions ? and increased thenumber of veterans and survivors of veterans entitled to disability compensation . He said when signing the disability bill that he was " looking forward " to signing the pension bill . It was then being revised in line with the requirements that he had stated on September 22 and that some of his assistants had elaborated in a meeting with House and Senate veterans committee staffs on September 25 . What is and is not implied by the headline on this account must be stated . " Racket " as used here does not mean crookery . It does mean that an interested party , soon to be identified , raised a loud and effective noise ? a racket ? about a " ratchet " that may or may not exist . The interested party misunderstood the meaning of the word as it is used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before getting into the story , a few elementary facts about the veterans scene must be summarized in order to make the story understandable . At the end of September 1,024,064 living veterans and 1,637,000 survivors of dead veterans were drawing pensions . The law signed by Carter November 4 raised the basic pension for an eligible veteran with no dependents from $2364 to $3550 per year . Pensions for veterans with dependents or with ailments that kept them " house-bound " and/or requiring " aid &; atten ? dance " could rise to amounts near double the basic allowance . Under recent law and the new law pen ? sioners have to be technically though often not really disabled , either by age or infirmity , and under the new law they and their spouses must have very little or no income other than the pension . The old law allowed a pensioner much more additional income . Surviving spouses ( usually but in these days not always widows ) are allowed two thirds of what a veteran is allowed . " Pension " is a misnomer . Now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needy veterans and their survivors . The new law emphasizes provable need and thereby makes the pension closer to a minimum allowed income in reality than it previously was . The President 's Office of Management and Budget calculates that the new law will add about two billion dollars to pension costs over the next five years and , if not screwed up by Congress in the meantime , will begin to save money in or around 1987 . The Congressional Budget Office is in approximate agree ? ment with these estimates . Disability compensation is something else . " Service-connected disability " is a loose term but generally it means wounds in combat or ailments demonstrably resulting from a veteran 's military service . Disability ratings , which determine the level of compensation , range from zero ( that 's right ) to 100 percent . Twenty seven thousand people with disability ratings from zero to 10 percent received military compensation payments as of September 30 . On that date 1,794,871 living veterans and 463,919 survivors received compensation payments . Disability ratings are connected with but do not specifically refer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
