They say it is the fatal destiny of Ireland that no purposes whatever which are meant for her good will prosper or take effect . <P> - Edmund Spenser <P> Spenser 's grim comment was written 400 years ago , but the Irish drama seems to be eternal . The latest chapter in this unhappy story ended last week when the Executive , Northern Ireland 's fragile coalition government of Protestants and Catholics , folded under the pressure of a devastating two-week general strike that had been called to preserve Protestant hegemony in Ulster . With the province near collapse , British Prime Minister Harold Wilson was forced to reimpose direct rule from London , and British Tommies once again were on the alert to prevent Irishmen from killing Irishmen . <P> With the end of Brian Faulkner 's five-month-old government , hopes for harmony between Catholics and Protestants were ended , and the prospect was for still more of the sectarian violence that has dominated Ulster for the last five years . Said Faulkner as he gave up his office : " It is the saddest day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fear we are the despair of our friends and the mockery of our enemies . " <P> A Nervous Breakdown . Between the intransigence of the Protestants and the bumbling of Britain 's Labor government there was , however , little chance for moderates like Faulkner . The Protestants , who make up about two-thirds of Ulster 's population , were angry at having been maneuvered by London into sharing power with the Catholic minority . They also feared that cooperation in Ulster would eventually lead to union with the predominantly Catholic Republic of Ireland-a political marriage that would instantly turn their majority into a minority . <P> " It was almost like a nervous breakdown , " said David Bleakley , a moderate Protestant . " All the little symbols of Protestant order have been going one by one , all the divinely enduring things of ordinary life and their traditions . " When Britain 's new government failed to heed the signals of the breakdown and offer any kind of remedy , Protestant laborers , organized into an ad hoc group called the Ulster Workers Council , began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of defiance . <P> Actually , not even the leaders of the U.W.C. expected that the strike would be successful enough to bring down the Faulkner coalition . Day by day , however , more and more workers stayed away from their jobs , and both industry and domestic services slowed to a near halt . Grocery stores ran out of food , ser vice stations emptied their gasoline tanks , and electric power was cut to one-fourth of normal output . By the end of two weeks , the strikers were so fully in control that they were regulating what little rural commerce remained and had stopped the refueling of airplanes at airports . As an added macabre touch , they even ordered gravediggers to stop burying the dead .
