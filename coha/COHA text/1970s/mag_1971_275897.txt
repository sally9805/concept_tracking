A century has passed since Mrs. O'Leary 's cow made her legendary kick at a lantern and touched off the Great Chicago Fire-time enough , one would think , to get the story straight . Now , in observation of the conflagration 's Oct. 8 anniversary , the Chicago Association of Commerce and Industry has published a new version of what happened . <P> In the association 's account , the cow was not the culprit . The guilty party was a one-legged neighbor of Mrs. O'Leary , Dennis ( " Peg Leg " ) Sullivan , who went to the O'Leary barn for a nightcap , lit his pipe and ignited the hay . As he tried to flee , his peg leg stuck in a floor crack . He discarded it and hobbled to safety by clinging to the cow . <P> While the city ruminates on its revised history , the fire will be commemorated in a concert on the lawn of the Chicago Historical Society by the Chicago Chamber Orchestra Association , which will offer its own brand of fireworks : Haydn 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ives ' Fireman 's Parade on Main Street and Dittersdorf 's The Fall of Phaethon ( about a god who burned to death ) .
