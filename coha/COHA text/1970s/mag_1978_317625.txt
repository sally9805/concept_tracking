Wayne Sulo Aho , 61 , says he had his " cosmic initiation " in the Mojave Desert in 1957 , when he encountered a " beautiful , majestic egg-shaped light " that was given off by a spacecraft . He claims that the extraterrestrial crew guided him through a number of " unusual experiences " including a military-style inspection of their ranks . Now president of an association of flying-saucer believers called the New Age Foundation , Inc. , Aho this year urged President Carter to appoint an Ambassador to Outer Space , just in case more otherworldly visitors show up . So far , the President has not responded . <P> Last week Aho 's group went ahead on its own and dedicated a 14-acre clearing near Washington 's Mount Rainier as a Spacecraft Protective Landing Area for the Advancement of Science and Humanities ( SPLAASH ) . The saucer enthusiasts plan to ask the Pentagon not to attack aliens who try to land there . How will they recognize their earthly crash pad ? Through mental telepathy , says Aho . " If we send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Just in case the vibes are bad , the landing site is also clearly marked by ropes and a sign reading NEUTRAL LANDING ZONE .
