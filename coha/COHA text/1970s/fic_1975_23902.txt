A story by Thomas Powers GOING FOR THE PAPER Thomas Powers is a ree-lance journalist and chort-story writer . IN THE CITY , Avakian always went out for the U Times while it was still dark , but in the country he read magazines with his morning coffee because the drugstore in Woodstock , twelve miles away , did not open until nine . He eased himself out of bed before dawn on frozen winter mornings , careful not to wake his wife . He liked to build a fire in the iron stove in the living room and then bask in its heat , reading . That first hour of the day , he said , was the closest thing to perfect peace he knew . When his wife came down she cooked for herself . She always offered to make something for him , too , but he always said not to bother , coffee was all he wanted . Then he went for the paper . The round trip in winter often took well over an hour , and sometimes , even with chains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper until after lunch and then gave it a full hour . He started with the front page but rarely followed a story inside . Instead , he proceeded methodically page by page and finished the front-page stories as he came across them . In the city his daughter used to wake early and come into the kitchen by herself , eyes puffy with sleep . Avakian would put the paper down , fix her a piece of white toast with grape jelly , and then go back to the paper . Jennifer had liked her toast light and her grape jelly thick . Avakian 's wife said there was more jelly than toast , what kind of breakfast was that ? Avakian said what the hell , she has n't got very many vices , and he fixed it the way Jennifer liked it . She had been at that age , around four , when little girls begin to be terribly thin . Sometimes Jennifer sat for twenty minutes with a serious expression on her face , tracing her upper lip with the end of her index finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out chatter about teachers or friends or plans for after school . Lost in the paper , Avakian murmured " Hmm " or " II-huh " when a break in Jennifer 's chatter seemed to require a response . " Daddy ! " she said if " Uh-huh " were inadequate , " talk to me ! " That brought him around . In the country the routine was different , or had been different . Avakian ate his breakfast alone now , and there was no one to interrupt his reading . He did not often think of things as they had been . If the question was put to him directly , he would admit that he missed his daughter more than he could say . When it began to grow light , Avakian went out to the woodshed to split some wood for the stove . He used a double-bitted ax which he sharpened himself and the sixteen-inch maple and cherry logs , cut and delivered unsplit by Hewitt Jones for $30 a cord , would burst apart with a loud , satisfying crack ! After a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hurt where he had cut it with the ax four years before . He filled the woodbox by the stove , built up the tire , and then made himself some toast in the kitchen , staring out the window at the falling snow in the gray after-dawn light while he waited for the toaster . No one at this end of the valley farmed anymore . There were no children in the valley . The local people were moving out and the summer people were moving in . He had been one of the first . Avakian heard his wife on the stairs , and a moment later she came in , tying the belt to her wrapper . " It 's freezing upstairs , " she said . " It took me ten minutes just to build up the courage to get out of bed . Can I fix you something ? " " No , thanks . " " Sure ? I 'm going to cook myself an egg anyway . " " That 's okay , I 'm fine . " Avakian went into the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and picked up a copy of Foreign A ffairs . Avakian sometimes said he followed the news because the export-import business reflected every ripple in the world situation , especially when it came to textiles . The real reason was simpler : he liked to see how things turned out . He followed running stories the way other men follow football teams . He sometimes woke in the morning wondering what the headlines were . If the military took over some jungle republic in Africa , Avakian picked it up like a seismograph . Avakian said , listen : when the tide comes in the whole coast goes under , some places sooner and some places later . What happens in Greece can happen here , et cetera , et cetera . Later he admitted that was all bullshit ; he just liked reading the paper . " You 're not going in for the paper , are you ? " " Sure , " said Avakian without looking up . " It 's been snowing all night . " " The chains are on the ear . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day sitting in a ditch . " " I 'll be all right . " " You certainly are a creature of habit , " said Avakian 's wife . " I honestly think you 'd walk to Woodstock for the paper if you had to . " " I might , " said Avakian , " if I knew there 'd be one left when I got there . " " What makes you so stubborn ? Really . " " My tough Armenian ancestors . " " Your tough Armenian mother , you mean . She used to say every child should be toilet trained by her first birthday , and nine months is n't too soon . " " She was trying to build character . " " I can just hear her saying , ' Brave little boys do n't cry . ' " " They do n't . " " You all but chop your foot off , and then you try to tape it back on . " " We 're just alike , " said Avakian . " I never give in and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jennifer into an Amazon , " said Avakian 's wife . Avakian said nothing . le IIE SNOW WAS DEEPER than Avakian had xpeeted , but the car started immediately . The engine exhaust was heavy and bluish in the cold air , and the sound of the engine was pleasantly muffled beneath the blanket of snow on the hood . When Avakian came to the fork he decided to go over the mountain because it was quicker . It was odd . Every once in a while , for reasons he could not grasp , people converged on the drugstore in Woodstock first thing in the morning , and the Times would be gone by nine-thirty or ten . The Boston papers were usually left but that was n't the same . Avakian said it took a long time to learn to read a paper . A banner headline in Boston might be on page 96 in New York . For Avakian it was the Times or nothing . Avakian made the first steep place without any trouble , but when he came to the farm at the turn he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To kill the skid he took his foot off the gas and then did n't have time to shift gears before his momentum was gone completely . There was n't a prayer of starting from a dead stop at that point on the hill , so Avakian carefullybacked down to the long straight where the ascent was more gradual . He got going but not fast enough to make the turn . That meant lie had to back all the way down the mountain to the fork and either try again or take the valley road , which was longer . He started down the hill , going slowly , but after five minutes his neck developed a crick , and he turned around the other way until it started to hurt that way , too . Then lie tried backing by using the mirror but he got confused and went into the ditch . He turned off the engine and sat there fur a full minute , feeling the cold come in , utterly disgusted with himself . Then he got out of the car and waded around it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ache again , He knew it would be killing him before he could dig himself out . Avakian looked out across the dim , gray valley and wondered how long it would take to walk to the nearest house if he could n't get out by himself . Johnson 's was only a mile but Johnson had no tractor . Hewitt Jones , two miles beyond that , had a tractor but no phone , and Avakian did n't want to ask Hewitt anyway . Hewitt had pulled him out once the year before . " What you doing out on a morning like this ? " he had asked . " I was going for the paper , " said Avakian . " Seems a lot of trouble for nothing . " " Oh , there 's always something in it , " said Avakian . " There 's nothing in it but a bunch of crap ! " said Hewitt , startling Avakian with his sharpness . " It 's all lies and people trying to get ahead ! I have n't read a paper in twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business you had to keep your eye on the economy , but Hewitt was n't having any . " It 's nothing but a hunch of crap ! " he said again . An odd man , crabbed and unpredictable . When he saw Avakian limping after axing his foot , Hewitt said every woodsman 's legs were scarred . That was the price of his skill . Hewitt pulled up his woolen pant leg , resealing a long , wide scar on his shin , bluish against the white skin . " They had to drag me down out of the woods on a sled , " he said . " If I 'd been alone I 'd of died . " It was probably true Avakian had come close to dying himself . ? ! tr Jeffrey Gatrall It had been summer then , and Jennifer had just started to walk . Avakian had been splitting logs . The ax glanced off a hard place and the next thing Avakian knew he was on the ground . There was a neat slice in his boot , just below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Avakian had a second to wonder if he had cut himself before the blood rose up out of the slice . It was odd . The cut was terrible but the pain did n't come for a long time . His wife wanted to leave for the hospital immediately . " It 's all right , " Avakian said . " When I was in the Boy Scouts they showed me how to cut adhesive tape in a special way so you could hold a cut together . " " Are you crazy ? " his wife shouted . " They 're called butterflies , " said Avakian , but his leg was so slippery with blood by the time he got his hoot off that he could n't get the adhesive to stick . He used a kitchen towel for a tourniquet and managed to get the bleeding stopped ; then he sponged his leg clean around the cut , and finally he patted it dry with another towel . This time the adhesive stuck , but when he loosed the tourniquet the blood started again and the adhesive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tourniquet on , saying the blood would soon dry around the wound and he could loosen it again . After a while his wife said , " Your foot 's turning blue ! " He loosened the tourniquet , the bleeding started again , and he had to repeat the whole process a third time . " What 's the matter with you ? " cried his wife . " What are you trying to do to yourself ? " " Take it easy , " said Avakian . This time he left the tourniquet on until his foot was purple and completely numb , although he did not mention the numbness to his wife . Then he loosened the tourniquet very slowly until the feeling came back and the purple went away . He stayed right where he was on the kitchen stoop from nine in the morning until nearly one o'clock , while the blood slowly seeped into the dirt floor of the woodshed and dried . Avakian read a book and insisted he was perfectly comfortable . At one he hobbled inside and spent the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ought to see a doctor , " said his Wife . In the middle of the night he woke groggily and heard his wife shouting his name . Her voice was hysterical . The light went on . Avakian felt only half awake ; he tried to concentrate . The sheet was wet with blood , bright as new paint , halfway up his thigh . He got a tourniquet back on , and somehow they got into the car and strapped Jennifer into her car seat . Avakian said , " Fine , fine , " when his wife asked how he felt as they jounced over the dirt road in the darkness through dark woods , but the truth was that he was close to fainting . When they got to the hospital the doctor was furious . He sewed up the cut and said , " You 're damned lucky you did n't lose your foot . " Then he added , " Or your life . " " I was told that 's how surgeons avoid a scar , " said Avakian . " Not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have n't you got any sense ? " After that Avakian 's wife wanted him to pay extra and let Hewitt Jones split the wood , but Avakian said he liked doing it himself . He never cut himself again , and Hewitt , who neverthought anybody did anything right , once con ? ceded that Avakian had got to be a pretty good man with an ax . The scar and the ache in wet weather were the price he had paid for his skill . He 'd be damned if he 'd ask Hewitt to drive up here on an open tractor to pull him out . Avakian took out the shovel he kept in the trunk , and for the next two hours he worked steadily . The snow stopped and the air cleared and a cold wind began to sweep up across the field , driving powdery snow into his face , each flake with the stinging sharpness of a grain of sand . His boots soaked through , and his left foot throbbed with pain . Avakian was hot um der his coat , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stopped to rest he could feel the cold tears sliding down over his cheeks . It was odd . Avakian had n't cried since he was eight years old , not even when Jennifer died , but his eyes were blurred with tears now and his cheeks were wet . IT WAS NEARLY ELEVEN when he got out of the ' ditch . He backed the rest of the way down the hill , ignoring the crick in his neck , and at the bottom he debated briefly if it was still worth making the trip . He decided , hell , he 'd come this far , and he started off again , but this time on the longer valley road . As soon as he saw the paper rack at the back of the drugstore Avakian knew he was too late . There were still a few Boston papers . but the Times was gone . He asked anyway . " All gone , " said the man at the cash register , who was counting bills and writing down the numbers on a piece of paper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come in ? " he asked . " Oh , I could n't sell you one of those , " said the man with a little smile . " They all pay for the paper , and if they do n't pick it up just save it for them . " " I 'd have been here at nine-thirty if I had n't gone into the ditch , " said Avakian . " If you 'd called I would have saved you one , " said the man . Avakian stood in front of the rack , staring at the Boston papers . He felt a desperate curiosity just to see the front page of the Times . He picked up a chapstick from a rack near the register . Next to it was a can with a slot in the top and a picture on the front of a girl about six wearing steel leg braces and leaning on crutches . Her face was split with a silly , happy smile , as if , Avakian thought , she had just seen her father come through the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Inside each small tan box , visible through its cellophane window , was an ounce of maple sugar molded in the shape of an Indian head . Avakian picked up one of those , too . " There must be somebody who lives too far away to make it on a day like today , " Avakian said . " I could call and ask if they were willing to sell me the paper . " The man was in the middle of a count and did n't answer . Avakian waited . " What do you think ? " said Avakian . The man looked up with the same little smile . " I kind of hate to bother ' em , " he said . " I 'm not trying to be difficult , " said Avakian . " It 's just that in my business it 's important to keep on top of the news . " " You sure are determined , " said the man . " All right " He picked up the phone and dialed. " fieIlo , Josh ? This is Herb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uh-huh . Will you be in later ? The reason I ask , there 's a man here who wants a copy of the Times , and he 's wondering if you might sell him yours . I 'm all out . Uh-huh . " He put his hand over the mouthpiece . " He says he likes the crossword . " " Tell him I 'll leave him the crossword page . " " Says he 'll leave the crossword page . Uhhuh . Uh-huh . " He put his hand over the mouthpiece again . " He says he uses the paper for starting fires when he 's done . " " Tell him buy him a copy of the Globe . ' " The man sighed and repeated the offer . " Uhhuh , " he said . " He 's desperate , I do n't know why . I 'll tell him . Sorry to bother you . " The man hung up . his smile was gone . " Look , " he said , " his wife likes the recipes , he saves the sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he does n't want the paper all cut up into shreds . " " Can you try someone else ? " " No , I can not . " " Then how about just letting me take a look at the headlines ? give it right back . " " Look ... " said the man . " I 'm not trying to be difficult , " said Avakian . " All I want is a look at the headlines . What difference can it make ? " The man sighed . " All right , " he said . He reached under the counter and handed Avakian a copy of the Times with the name " Barnes " written in black crayon across the top . In the following ten minutes Avakian read every word of every story on the front page , then opened the paper to the second section to look through the index . " I thought you were just going to read the headlines , " said the man . " I 'm almost done , " said Avakian . " I just want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bell tinkle as the door opened behind him . Footsteps came down the aisle . " Morning , Mister Barnes , " said the man at the cash register . Avakian looked around . " This gentleman was just looking at your headlines . " " Sorry , " said Avakian . " I got stuck in the ditch , and by the time I got here the Times was gone . " " You drove all the way in just for the paper ? " " I had to pick up some other things , too . " " I live down the street and I ahnost did n't bother , " said Barnes . " If you can use the paper you 're welcome to it . I do n't even know why I order it . Habit , I guess . It 's all slanted any-way . " " Thanks very much , " said Avakian . " I appreciate it . " He reached into his pocket . " Forget it , " said Barnes . " I hate the damn thing . I start to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Really , I insist , " said Avakian , holding out 15 cents . " No , no , no , " said Barnes , " I 'd feel like a thief . " Avakian dropped the 15 cents into the can with the picture of the girl in leg braces . " This 'll be a contribution in your name , " he said . B ACK IN THE CAR Avakian opened the little package of maple sugar , took a bite , and sucked on the creamy sweetness . Jennifer had loved maple sugar . Whenever she saw the little tan packages with the cellophane windows she asked her father to buy her one . Then , back in the car , she would sit next to him on the front seat and eat the maple su , ar in little bites , turning the candy this way and that as she chewed , planning where to take the next bite . " Look , " she would say , " now he has n't got any feathers ! " Or , " I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York when Jennifer got sick . It was winter , a little over a year ago , and at first it had seemed like a cold , or one of the bugs kids get . She had a slight fever , nothing much , but Anne kept her home from school anyway . By evening she was hot to the touch and throwing up . Anne called the doctor , and he said it sounded like something making the rounds . Just give her an aspirin and ginger ale and put her to bed . In the morning she was flushed , and the bed was wet where she had thrown up during the night . Anne called the doctor again , and he said to call back that afternoon if Jennifer was n't any better . By early afternoon her temperature reached 104 . Anne called the doctor again . " She 's terribly listless , " she said , " and she 's lying in a funny way . She 's arching her back like an acrobat . " " Get her to the hospital immediately , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already plugged into a lot of machines . " I just took a spinal tap , " said the doctor . " When the results come up we 'll know what we 're dealing with . " " What do you expect ? " Avakian asked . " Guessing does n't change a thing , said the doctor . " Let 's wait and see . " " Well , what are you afraid of , then ? " " Let 's wait for the results . " " No , " said Avakian . " Tell me what we have to worry about . " " It could be meningitis , " said the doctor . " Then what ? " " There 's still a good chance , " said the doctor . Later , Avakian and his wife sat on straight-backed chairs in Jennifer 's room and watched a bottle of dextrose solution empty through a tube into her arm , drop by drop . It was odd . Jennifer was thinner than ever , but the flush of the fever and the shine of tears in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin and the blossoming rose of fever in her cheeks made her seem a delicate , spiritual , almost incandescent being . Her eyes were open , but she did not seem to be looking at them , exactly . At the end of visiting hours Avakian explained that they had to leave . Jennifer did n't seem to be listening , The next day Jennifer went into a coma . The doctors packed her in ice and she turned blue . It seemed as though her body had simply evaporated , as if she had been starved for weeks . Late that afternoon things changed . The air of urgency seemed to go . When the doctor looked in he was cold , perfunctory , and abrupt . He lifted Jennifer 's head from the pillow and then let it drop back . It fell with a little plop sound . Her neck was perfectly limp . The doctor tried to explain . " Meningitis is a difficult disease , " he said . " Even with the best available care , 4 percent die and 6 percent are seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then it 's a question of numbers . " No one actually used the word " vegetable , " but Avakian got the idea . it was odd . Under the circumstances he might have been glad to see Jennifer die but he was n't . I 'D LIKE TO PAINT THE HOUSE this summer , " 1 Anne said at dinner that night . Outside the wind had died , the night sky was clear , and the temperature was dropping steadily . " All right , " said Avakian . He was thinking about a story he had read in the paper . Anne was a good-looking woman with a full figure that threatened to get out of control , a thick head of brown hair , and the pale , perfect skin which Jennifer had inherited . Avakian sometimes forgot what an attractive woman his wife was , and then he would notice the unmistakable interest of some man at a party , and be reminded with an unpleasant start . If the man made his interest too plain , Anne would blush in an odd way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would appear on her neck or on the side of her face , and she would become awkward and even flustered . " Something bright and airy , " said Anne . " 1 meant to do it long ago . What do you think ? " " I think it sounds fine , " Avakian said . He trusted his wife 's taste and liked to see how things turned out . She had a talent for making everything go a long way . The first year they were married she did over their entire apartment by herself . It took months . Avakian kidded her about working so hard . He sometimes came in at midnight while she was in the critical middle of something , holding a long section of paste-covered paper ready to go up . " It 's beautiful , " Avakian said . " I love it . " " Do you like it ? " " I love it , " he said and put his arms around her , kissing her neck while she squirmed . " Help ! Stop ! " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avakian would n't stop ; he kissed her face and neck and breasts until a blush rose on her neck and she ceased to struggle . " It 'll freshen the place up , " said Anne . " Give ths a new  --  I do n't know . " " There was an interesting story in the paper today , " said Avakian . " A group of Afrikaaners are protesting the banning of a novel in Afrikaans . One of them said , ' If only we had protested the banning of English novels ... ' " " I 'd like to start with Jennifer 's room , " said Anne . " Fine , " said Avakian . " The lesson is so clear . " " Do n't you think it makes sense ? " " I think it 's a fine idea . I was just thinking how easy it is to see what 's happening to other people while you 're blind to yourself . When you think of some of the governments we have supported in the last twenty years ... " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes I am , " said Avakian . " It 's just that I trust your judgment in these things . I 'm willing to leave them entirely up to you . " His wife looked at him for a moment and then started to clear the table . Avakian went into the living room , picked up the copy of Foreign Aflairs he had been reading that morning , and opened it to his place . He could hear his wife puttering about in the kitchen , doing the dishes , putting them away , opening and closing cupboards . When she was done she came into the living room and sat down . She glanced through the paper quickly , the pages rattling . Then she smoked a cigarette . Then she got up . " I think I 'll go up to bed , " she said . " I 'll be up soon , " said Avakian . " I 'm just going to read a while . " He listened to his wife 's feet on the stairs . It was odd , he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore . There was so much going on in the world , so much to read . It was ? all he could do to keep up .
