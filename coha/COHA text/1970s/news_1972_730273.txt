txt A few years ago , Mrs. Patricia Porter might have bought her new toaster-oven at a department store or discount house But a few ' weeks ago , the West Orange , N.J. , housewife flipped through a catalog at home , selected a General Electric model and drove to the Summit Catalog Showroom in nearby Wayne . Within minutes , she paid her $21 ? $6 less than the price in a local department store  --  and drove off with the toaster-oven . Attracted by the convenience and economy of such shopping , buyers like Mrs. Porter are creating a boom for catalog warehouses  --  and another challenge to traditional retailers . In such operations , customers simply pre-shop from a mailed catalog and buy at a warehouse ? where all the goods are stored out of the shoplifters ' reach . Operating costs are low , and profits can be high , owners say . About 1,800 catalog showrooms now operate across the nation , at least double the number three years ago , says Catalog &; Showroom Merchandiser , the industry 's trade magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2 billion this year from last year 's $1 billion , predicts Ralph H. Sullivan , publisher of the magazine . Some think catalog operations will succeed discount houses as retailing 's big growth field . " Catalog warehousiug is today at the same stage that discounting was 20 years ago , " says Philip Wise , chairman and president of Volume Merchandise Inc. , New York , a discount chain that is entering the catalog field . Failing Shoplifters Among other advantages , losses from shoplifting are slashed to about 0.5% of sales in a catalog warehouse from 6.5% in a traditional volume merchandise discount store , Mr. Wise estimates . The catalog operations , which specialize in appliances , jewelry and other hard goods , keep most of their showroom merchandise in enclosed cases , the goods actually sold are kept in closed inventory rooms which may take up two-thirds of the outlet 's space . At a time when shoplifting and pilferage costs business an estimated $3 billion a year , this security is one of the biggest attractions to a catalog operation , owners say . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a discount store , partly because they require only about one-third as many sales people , owners say . As customers personally pick up about 95% of the merchandise sold , delivery costs and headaches are minimal . There are usually no accounts receivable problems ; the only credit is handled through major credit-card companies and banks As a result , many companies active in discounting are turning to catalog operations . Vornado Inc. ( operators of the Two Guys chain ) , Volume Merchandise , Giant Stores Corp. , Dayton-Hudson Corp. , Grand Union Co. , Supermarkets General Corp. , Zale Corp . and Gordon Jewelry Corp . have all either started catalog showrooms or are about to open them . E.F . Co. , which operates the Plaid Stamp merchandise program , has also said it will enter the field . And Designcraft Jewel Industries Inc. , a jewelry supplier , has announced that it will open catalog showrooms in 38 states under a license from F.C . Dahnken Co. , a catalog operation based in Salt Lake City . As previously reported , May Department Stores Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , last week said they reached agreement in principle to form a new joint venture that will operate a minimum of 150 catalog showroom outlets in the U.S. Officials at the May concern have " been studying this new form of retail distribution and are convinced it has tremendous potential , " Stanley J. Goodman , chairman of the company said . Some discount operations anxious to cont'nue growing figure the catalog trend comes just at the right time . There are now over 6,000 discount houses in operation , up from 4,100 five years ago , estimates Kurt Barnard , director of the Mass Retailing Institute . Thus in many metropolitan areas , the market is glutted , industry sources complain . " Greatest Growth in Catalogs " " Our greatest growth has to be with catalog showrooms , " says Theodor Kaufman , chairman of Giant Stores Co. , a New England discount chain . " We 're not going to stop opening discount stores , but we will reduce the rate of openings , " he adds . " We net 2% on sales in our Giant Stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . Catalog operations also produce a much higher return on invested capital , he adds . To open and stock a 50,000-square-foot discount store takes $500,000 to $600,000 , but the cost fo : a catalog store capable of similar volume is only about $300,000 , Mr. Kaufman says . Like others in its field , the Giant Stores catalog operations avoid clothes and other soft goods . This eliminates worry about style changes and the complexities of sizes and makes it easier to replenish stocks , Mr. Kaufman says . Concentrating on appliances and jewelry , which are comparatively compact , boosts volume prospects . While a 20,000square-foot discount house will generate $40 to $100 in sales per square foot each year , a similar catalog showroom will produce over $200 a square foot , Mr. Kaufman finds . " We now have eight catalog showrooms and expect to have 15 by November , generating $20 million a year in sales , " adds the official . " We expect to add 20 next year for a total of 35 doing about $80 million in the fiscal year ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional discount stores should add another $80 million to sales , he predicts . Besides other advantages , the catalog operation also helps retailers beat the rising cost of land . As buyers pre-shop in catalogs , locating showrooms in an expensive , high-traffic area is n't necessary , catalog men say . Leasing such expensive space in a good area for a discount store now costs about $1 85 a square foot per year , compared with only $1 35 five years ago . Giant Stores finds . In contrast , Mr. Kaufman believes the most economic locations for catalog showrooms are old supermarkets or variety stores that hale closed after their owners opened larger , more modern stores in nearby shopping centers . These older buildings are usually in low-rent areas , he says . Other catalog men agree . " If we had our ' druthers , ' we 'd be two blocks away from shopping centers , " says Andrew Lewis , vice president of Best Products Co. , Richmond , Va. , the largest publicly held catalog discount operation . " There 's no use paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopping , " he explains . Best Products ' strategy seems to pay off . In its stores , which range from 60,000 square feet to 80,000 square feet , the company has annual sales averaging $117 a square foot . This compares with the $98 a square foot at K-Mart discount department stores , a division of S.S. Kresge Co . Many analysts consider K-Mart one of the best-managed discount chains in the U.S. Best Products has six showrooms in operation and expects to have 10 more units by Christmas , Mr. Lewis says . He declines to make any profit forecast , but says that security analysts are estimating the company earned 70 cents to 80 cents a share on sales of about $50 million in the fiscal year ending last Friday . This would compare with earnings of $1 02 million , or 50 cents a share ( adjusted for two stock splits ) , on sales of $31 25 million last fiscal year . Of course catalog operations also have their own special problems  --  such as the need to produce the catalogs . Except for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared by large merchandise distribution companies such as Creative Merchanclusmg Inc , Jewelcor Inc. and American Merchandisers Inc . The catalogs generally cost the showroom 70 cents to $1.50 apiece The catalog producers generally obtain the artwork free from the various manufacturers The catalog showrooms then send the catalogs out in mass mailings in their areas . In most cases , the catalog is the showroom 's only advertising expense But some large chains , such as Best Products , often blanket an area with newspaper and television advertising too . Despite the growth of catalog showrooms , many retailers remain wary . The field mainly involves only a comparatively small range of goods , they note . If an operator does n't have a strong knowledge of jewelry , small appliances and similar goods , catalog operations may be more troublesome than they look , warns one discounter who specializes in soft goods .
