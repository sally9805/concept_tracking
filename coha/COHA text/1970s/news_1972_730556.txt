txt The latest outbreaks along the Israeli-Syria border underline the fact that 27 years after World War II enden there is one important postwar frontier still unsettled . Arabs and Israelis have yet to come to terms with each other . Every other frontier disturbed by World War II has been substantially settled by thirs time . In Europe the Russian frontier of influence still stands roughly where the armies came to rest at the time of the German surrender in 1945 . In Asia , the near end of the Vietnam war is a last step toward achieving the same relative stability there which now exists in Europe . In Africa , Africans have taken over from former imperial rulers . In South America no frontier is in serious dispute . But in the Middle East the Arabs still cling to the hope of someday driving Israel at least back behind its pre-1967 frontiers . Last-ditchers , of course , still hope to liquidate the Israeli state itself . Able to concentrate ? The time approaches when the statesmen of the world will be able to concentrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclined . Once Vietnam is out of the way , the Middle East will be the most dangerous remaining problem from the World War II era , and the only one still in serious question . In Washington , top people are beginning to get ready for a new American initiative about the Middle East . There are indications that President Nixon and Henry Kissinger took the first steps when they were last in Moscow . Moscow , at least , is no longer actively supporting a high level of tension in the area . True , it is still giving enough support to Syria and Egypt to retain its credentials as a friend of the Arab states . But indications are that it is no longer counseling the Egyptians against any form of settlement with Israel . And it is no longer maintaining a posture of outright hostility towards Israel . A different way of saying the above is that Russia appears to have withdrawn from between the Arab states and a possible settlement . The settlement will be allowed to happen , if it can be arranged . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That means that Washington could make a new movie without the certainty that Russia would be maneuvering to spoil it . And it also means that Mr. Kissinger might be able to top his expectable and expected settlement of Vietnam witha solution to the problem of the Middle East . Of course Mr. Kissinger may want a rest when he has finished Vietnam . But he has confided to friends that he enjoys the life he has been leading and there is no external evidence that he is weary of playing the role of world 's top diplomat . He is the first American to play it . He is the most famous player in the role since Metternich . Why would anyone want to retire from the stage so long as there is one more difficult problem to settle ? It is a reasonable guess that he will not want to retire to his memories until he has tackled and mastered the last and most difficult of all those left-over problems from World War II . The big remaining question is whether the overall situation in the Middle East is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong , so strong that some Israelis may be tempted to hold out for a while yet on the theory that time is steadily improving their bargaining position . The Egyptian Government is weak . A political coup could topple it . The Arab countries are less ' united now than ever . Russia is playing a diminished and less bellicose role in the area . Israel 's relative military position is far stronger than ever before . It is absolute master of the whole area . But will this condition improve or diminish ? President Nixon in Washington has had his election victory and no longer has to worry about the Jewish vote the next time around . Washington is anxious to protect Western access to Arabian oil and this requires improved American relations with the Arab states . Russia remains a force in the Middle East , although presently pursuing a " low profile " policy . And world public opinion has never entirely forgotten the plight of the unsettled Palestinian refugees . Perhaps Israel 's bargaining power is at an all-time peak right now , and this may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Egypt , first . Jordan is ready to settle the moment Egypt makes settlement respectable . Then Syria would be odd man out . ' Washington has new arguments to present to Israel .
