LARGELY unremarked , the U.S. Government has been practicing a kind of prior restraint for three decades . By routinely stamping so much material as secret , it has cut off the flow of information to press and public , only to turn it back on at convenient moments or let it dribble out in calculated leaks . The disclosure of the Pentagon papers serves as a reminder of how much more information-hundreds of millions of pages-remains classified . A Washington bureaucrat can stamp as secret virtually anything he wants to . <P> That license is likely to be sharply curtailed as a result of the uproar over the Pentagon report . In hearings begun last week by the House Foreign Operations and Government Information Subcommittee , Arthur Goldberg , former U.S. representative to the United Nations , testified that of the countless thousands of documents he had read and written , 75% should never have been classified . Some 15% , he continued , should have been kept secret for a short time . A mere 10% deserved to be classified for a longer period . William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Defense Department , went even further than Goldberg . Of the some 20 million classified documents , including copies , in the Defense Department , he estimated that only one-half of 1% should be kept from public view . <P> Dubious Material . Classification is a byproduct of America 's rise to world power . As the U.S. made its far-flung commitments in World War II , secret military information began to accumulate . The cold war speeded up the process . In 1953 President Eisenhower tried to straighten out the classification chaos by issuing an executive order . It broke down classification into three categories that are still used today : top secret , secret and confidential . Top secret is intended to cover information whose disclosure would result in " exceptionally grave damage to the nation . " This means revealing critical military or defense plans or secret technological developments that would be useful to an enemy . Only a top-ranking military officer or department official can stamp a document top secret . Still , a lot of dubious material gets labeled top secret . All but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that designation . <P> <P> Even more discretion is allowed bureaucrats in using the lesser degrees of classification . Most communications with foreign governments fall into the secret category . But bureaucrats have got in the habit of stamping documents secret simply to make sure that their superiors will read them They know that a confidential classification will hardly raise an eyebrow . As for unclassified material , it is all but superfluous . As often as not , it consists of the transcript of a speech that was delivered in public .
