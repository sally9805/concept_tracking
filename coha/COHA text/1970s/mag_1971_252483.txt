IN the U.S. today , only the rich can afford to be ill ; even the modestly well-off may not be able to bear the financial burden of a long , debilitating illness . The average daily cost of hospitalization has risen from $56 to $144 since 1960 , while the nation 's total health bill has more than doubled , to $70 billion , or $324 per person , a year . As his prescription for the malaise of the American health-care system , President Nixon last week sent to Congress a package that aims to improve and augment existing programs through private enterprise rather than new forms of Government control . Under the President 's plan : <P> &gt;The major burden of increased medical costs would fall on U.S. employers , large and small , who would be required to provide alt employees with a health-insurance plan that includes hospitalization and major-medical , maternity and pediatric benefits , plus catastrophic-illness coverage to the tune of $50,000 a year . The program would cost employers at least $2.5 billion a year-and the Government at least $2 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be required to pay 25% of the cost . Such a system would cover 150 million Americans , including 10 million working poor who now have no coverage at all . <P> &gt; The Federal Government would pay either all or a substantial part of the cost of health insurance for some 5.3 million lowincome , largely nonworking families through a new Family Health Insurance Plan . Under it , families with incomes below $3,000 a year would be given the equivalent of a $600 annual premium in private insurance ; those earning up to $5,000 would be required to make at least token payments toward the policies . <P> <P> &gt; The Government would pick up the entire $1.4 billion annual tab for the Part B supplement to Medicare , which now covers doctor bills and outpatient services for nearly 20 million of the program 's participants . As a result , the elderly who now pay $5.30 a month for the supplemental coverage would receive what amounts to an average 5% increase in Social Security benefits . <P> &gt; Grants totaling $23 million , plus loan guarantees for buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formation of prepaid health-maintenance organizations like California 's Kaiser Plan . Such groups , which provide broad medical and preventive health services for fixed annual fees , now cover 7,000,000 Americans . Some Administration officials believe that the plans can reduce by half the average number of days that patients spend in hospitals . <P> &gt; Funds totaling nearly $100 million would be made available to encourage medical schools to train more doctors and allied health personnel . Direct grants and financial incentives would be offered to doctors to form group practices or work in ghettos and rural communities , and $15 million would be set aside to establish family health centers in areas where medical facilities are scarce . <P> &gt; Efforts would be made to reduce overall medical costs by developing preventive-care programs and thus cutting down on hospital admissions . A watchdog commission , added to the Administration proposals as an eleventh-hour afterthought , would have regulatory power over the private health-insurance industry , including authority to prevent unwarranted increases in coverage costs .               @ @ @ @ @ @
