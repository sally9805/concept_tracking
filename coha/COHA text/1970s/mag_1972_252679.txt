As war hero , Premier and President , Ismet Inn has occupied center stage in Turkish politics for more than half a century . He helped modern Turkey 's founding father , Kemal Atatrk , win the country 's battle for independence in 1923 , and succeeded him as President in 1938 . After 1950 , when he was defeated for the presidency , Inn continued to rule the Republican People 's Party with an iron hand . Last week , at the age of 87 , Turkey 's elder statesman was finally forced into retirement . <P> The revolt against Inn was led by his protg and heir apparent , Blent Ecevit . When Turkey 's elected government was toppled last year by a military coup , Inn and Ecevit disagreed over the future course of party policy . Ecevit resigned as the Republican People 's secretary-general , and Inn , perhaps unwisely , called the party to an extraordinary congress last week for a vote of confidence . " Either you choose me or him , " Inn told members . By a vote of 709 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is deaf and almost blind , Inn will be missed in the corridors of power . Because of his vast prestige as a national hero , Inn was probably the only Turkish politician with enough stature to apply a moderating pressure on the generals , who may now be tempted to take an even greater role in the country 's internal affairs in order to crack down on leftist dissent .
