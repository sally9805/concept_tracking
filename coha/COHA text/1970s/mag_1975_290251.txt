Four years ago , Don King was inmate No. 6178 at the Marion ( Ohio ) Correctional Institution . He spent his days in the prison work gang hauling hog manure as he served a one-to-20-year manslaughter sentence for having killed a numbers racketeer who had doublecrossed him . Released in September 1971 after four years in jail , he now rides to work in a chauffeured 21-ft . Cadillac limousine . For that work he rents a choice office suite : the $85,000-a-year , eight-room penthouse atop the RCA Building in Rockefeller Center . That eyrie high above Manhattan is symbolic of King 's position as the most audacious and suddenly the most powerful promoter in sport-and one of the most successful black businessmen in America . <P> His business is boxing . In less than two years , King has put together four heavyweight championship bouts , including the $10 million George Foreman v. Muhammad Ali extravaganza in Zare last fall . Next Monday he will add a fifth when Ali fights European Champion Joe Bugner in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia , the climax of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fights in New York City . In the fall King hopes to cap his promotions with a $12 million Ali-Joe Frazier rematch , probably in the Philippines . That would bring the total take of King ring deals to more than $30 million . " He 's done impossible things , " says Ali . Adds King in his booming baritone : " Right now my success is phenomenal . " <P> King , 43 , is also a phenomenon . An almost larger than life figure at 6 ft. 2 in. , with a barrel chest and an Afro that leaps from his temples as if galvanized , he works at a pace that would exhaust most men . His 18-hour days and hundreds of phone calls a week have helped him outflank such established matchmakers as Madison Square Garden and Top Rank , Inc. , a longtime promoter and closed-circuit telecaster of Ali fights . Of course he has not been hurt by the cooperation of Ali and his manager , Black Muslim Executive Herbert Muhammad , who are happy to break old traditions and deal with a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a flair for thinking-and acting-big . With Ali demanding prize money beyond the means of individuals or even corporations , King has made his deals with governments . Shrewd enough to realize that championship bouts featuring Ali are the kind of promotion that developing nations like to stage , King has courted heads of state in Cairo , Tehran , Lusaka ( Zambia ) , Manila and Kuala Lumpur . " The jet lag is so bad , " he says , " I eat breakfast 24 hours a day . " <P> Wherever he is and whatever he is eating , King comes on like a force of nature . With a mixture of grandiloquent rhetoric ( " I can not be castigated by accusation and invective " ) and jive ( " I like to make deals that give me my money and my honey at the same time " ) , King loves to hold forth on anything from capitalism to existentialism . Over his desk he keeps an incongruous pair of portraits : an original of Ali by LeRoy Neiman and a print of Rembrandt 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
