Trudeau too tart for Times <P> What the switchboard operators heard was definitely not mellow-speak . Not laid back either . It was sheer , white-hot anger . The Los Angeles Times , San Francisco Chronicle and half a dozen other papers had yanked Garry Trudeau 's Pulitzer-prizewinning comic strip Doonesbury , and thousands of irate devotees wanted to know why . <P> The answer was simple enough . Satirizing the pop politics of California 's Governor Jerry Brown , Trudeau had turned his biting pen on a labor lawyer and Brown contributor , Sidney Korshak , describing him with several harsh characterizations , including " known organized crime figure . " While Korshak is no stranger to criminal investigators , the newspapers felt , as the Times put it , that the cartoons were " unfair , irresponsible and unsubstantiated . " Callers accused the papers of trying to protect Brown . Said the Guv : " I think it is false and libelous , but I 'm flattered by the attention . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
