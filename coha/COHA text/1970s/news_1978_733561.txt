txt Letters JEFFERSON CHASEIRVING J. SLOAN Letters To Save New York City 's Transportation System To the Editor : The furor over Mayor Koch 's posture on Westway has obscured the fact that the investment of that entire one billion dollars will not save New York City 's transportation system if the basic direction of transportation planning in the metropolitan area remains unchanged . For during every administration in the last 30 years the same major transportation problems have both remained unsolved and become worse . ? Excessive auto use . Auto traffic to Manhattan has constantly increased , primarily because of the plain fact that for most suburban-based commuters there is no decent mass transit to any destination other than Penn Station or Grand Central . This leaves the entire upper midtown area , east and west , and the entire Wall Street area without commuter rail service . ? No direct rail freight access . New York is the only major city in the U.S. , and possibly the entire world , that still floats railroad cars across the river on barges . The Port AuthoriTo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aimed at improving its results which just as often add to its reputation for near-failure . Comes now such a proposal , the award of varsity letters to students who achieve scholastic success . The rationale is that this kind of incentive will serve as a rallying point and goal for student scholars , as it has long done for athletes . I really question the assumption that our best athletic students succeed as they do because of the promise of those varsity letters . They love playing the game , and they are willing to mine the physical attributes mother nature or genetics blessed them with so that they can win that game . By the same token , I would argue that student scholars for the most part also love the challenges of the academic disciplines , and that they operate from internal factors utilizing to the fullest whatever mother nature or genetics have blessed them with in terms of gray matter upstairs . Granted that there are a large number of student minds out there which arc not being developed and fulfilled . But this is no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring about that development and Dangerous Quip To the Editor : In your issue of April 2 you quote a member of the House Armed Services Committee , visiting the Soviet . Union : ' ' If the Russians want it a treaty limiting nuclear arms it must be had for us . " May I suggest that this quotation reveals a basic attitude which is not only obsolete but also fraught with mortal danger for the United States and all mankind . It is obsolete because it is unaware of the new fact of interdependence in which the advantage and disadvantage of one can also be the advantage or disadvantage of some other nation . It is fraught with danger because if the nuclear arms race and nuclear proliferation can not be controlled the prospects for the United States and all mankind are grim indeed ; for without such controls a nuclear world war appears to be inevitable . HANS J. MORGENTHAU New York , April 5 , 1978 ty was established for the express purpose of building one or more rail freight tunnels to eliminate that primitive arrangement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? Unused resources . The tracks that carry L.I.R.R. suburban trains in Queens are more than 50 percent unused even in the peak rush hours . These tracks could he used to carry subway trains also , serving large areas now without rapid transit at virtually no capital cost , and without interfering with suburban train service . ? Elevated structures falling apart . All elevated structures have a finite life , after which they are too dangerous to use , but there are no plans whatever to build substitute subway lines to prepare for the day when our elevateds become unusable . The Penn Central in Harlem and the L.I.R.R. in Brooklyn also have long stretches of elevated railroad which are approximately the same age as the elevated subways , and no plans to replace them either . ? No rail transit to the airports . London , Chicago , Cleveland and other // Jacqueline Chwa t fulfillment . Give those underachievers not honors symbols but competent and creative teaching , and provocative and productive curriculums . What these potential student scholars need are inspiration and stimulation in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses . It may he easier for educators to write purchase orders than to lead teachers and to develop curriculums , but it is not the more likely way to accomplish educational goals . Education is what education does . IRVING J. SLOAN Scarsdale , N.Y. , April 3 , 1978 Of Arms and Morality To the Editor : As a Democrat who voted for him , the thinking and morality of President Carter astonish me . He excoriated the Russians for arming both the Ethiopians and the Somalis so that they could destroy each other . Now , in the F-I5 airplane " package " he proposes that we Americans arm both the Israelis end the Saudis . How can one square the morality of this ? Of course , United States access to Mideast oil is what it 's all about . If we make Saudi Arabia a " confrontation state , " assuredly the Israeli 's first air target will be destruction of the oil wells and refining facilities . If Entebbe tells us anything , the Israelis will make it one way or another . In terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy leave us ? DAVID LAX Major , U.S.A.R. , Retired Red Hook , N.Y ? March 30 , 1978 cities already have or are building mass transit to their airports , but even though the need was recognized as pressing more than 10 years ago , nothing has been done in New York . In fact , our airports have since been extensively rebuilt , doubling their capacity , with no provision whatever for mass transit . ? Insufficient river crossings . The lack of river crossings to Manhattan produces millions of miles of unnecessary auto mileage and prevents optimum use of mass transit , but no new river crossings are planned for either the Hudson River or the East River despite massive postwar population shifts . This is a situation unmatched anywhere in the world for inconvenience , and in an age of energy shortage it is unthinkable . The really incredible part of all this is that there are six different Inca ! government agencies with transportation planning responsibilities in the New York metropolitan area , and theft lack of productivity is not due to getting in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mayor Koch must understand that you do no ' bring competence to City Hall by - , ratting rid of one club-house mayor ; you have to get rid of all the other incompetents responsible for our 30 years of drift and decay . The appointments of Robert Wagner Jr . and David Gurin were good choices , but the nut of the problem remains untouched : a middle-management planning cadre still doggedle clinging to the mistakes of the past Only a thorough house-cleaning will change the direction of our transportation planning , and thus save our transportation system , and this does nw require any money from Wesb , vay . It does require forceful leadership from the Mayor and his aides , however . JEFFERSON CHASE Jamaica , N.

NEUMANN , M.D. Department of New Haven , April 4 , 976 Student Scholars : The Wrong Incentive How World Bank Staff Members Earn Their Salaries To the Editor : In recent months , the alleged high salaries of World Bank staff have received considerable coverage Reuters dispatch . The Times March 16 . As executive directors of the bank , we would like to bring to the attention of the public the mistaken notions that have pervaded most of the discussions on the subject . The hank is international in character  --  it is not an agency of the United States Government . It has a corporate structure ( nongovernmental ) and therefore pays its salaries from earned income and not from taxes . The bulk of the funds the bank lends to the developing countries is raised in the world 's capital markets . In order to service this debt and to he credit-worthy for continued borrowing in those markets , it is imperative that the hank he run along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In its more than 30 years of operation , a period during which it has financed and supervised thousands of projects , it has not lost a single dollar in loan defaults . Another aspect often not appreciated is the tremendous amount of analysis the bank carries out in order to guide the development efforts of its borrowing members . Economic and technical expertise is perhaps in greater shortage than financial resources in the poor countries . For these developing countries , which have not only invested over $35 billion of their own funds in the $60 billion worth of projects under hank supervision but have also placed their fate with the bank on its advice , the need for competence can not be overemphasized . Today , bank staff is composed of more than 100 nationalities . Let us now deal with the principal criticism that World Bank salaries are higher than those prevailing in the U.S. civil service and that this places an unreasonable burden on the U.S. taxpayers who provide the funds for bank salaries . This is a gross misrepresentation of the facts . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. taxpayers , who pay hank salaries and administrative expenses from interest and other charges on bank loans . We , therefore , keep these expenses under constant scrutiny to insure they remain as low as possible . But we should also stress that the bank does not compete with the U.S. Government for the same type of staff . It competes with major financial institutions and other private companies all over the world . Whether in the U.S. or any other country , the highly experienced staff required by the charter of the World Bank does not come cheaply . We should point out , as members of the board of the World Bank , that we are concerned that the salaries of the staff should not be higher than justified . But the cost of bank staff should be measured against the corn . plex task it has been called upon to undertake , and the degree of success it has achieved . On both counts , believe the bank has an Outstanding record .               @ @ @ @ @ @
