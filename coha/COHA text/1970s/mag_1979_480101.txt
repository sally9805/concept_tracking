EVEN AS A SCHOOLBOY reciting the pledge of allegiance , I thought America an odd sort of place . It was not one country , apparently , but two . It said so in the flag oath . " I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America , " we chirped in unison , and then concluded triumphantly that it was " one nation indivisible , with liberty and justice for ail . " That was one America , the " nation . " whose " alabaster cities gleam , " we piped at other times , " undimmed by human tears . " But the flag hanging limply in the corner represented something else as well . There was " the Republic for which it stands . " an extra-added America , the " republic " whose nature and purport proved a puzzle too deep for the schoolboy mind to solve . Solve it , however , we must , because there are two distinct Americas , two separate objects of a patriot 's devotion , two distinct foundations of two contrary codes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other is the American republic . At every important juncture of our public life these two Americas conflict with each other . On a famous occasion some years ago , ? the President of the United States secured an injunction against the New York Times ordering it to cease publishing certain classified government documents , known collectively as " the Pentagon Papers . " Faced with an unprecedented attempt at press censorship , the Times promptly called on the aid of a distinguished law firm that it had been retaining for several decades . The distinguished law firm flatly refused to defend the Times against the violation of its constitutional liberties . To publish the documents in wartime , a senior partner said , was shameful , disgraceful , and unpatriotic . It would weaken the nation 's resolveand give aid and comfort to its enemies . As its patriotic duty to the country , the distinguished law firm willingly sacrificed its most prestigious client . But which America did the law firm so patriotically serve ? It served the corporate entity known as the nation . What it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infringement of liberty , to refuse to uphold the Constitution in a crisis , to support the alien methods of despotism ? surely that in a republic is shameful , disgraceful , and unpatriotic . The nation pulls one way , the republic another . They are today deadly rivals for the love and loyalty of the American people . Choosing up sides T IS AN ODD SORT of rivalry , one that the / republic , on the face of it , ought to win hands down . The republic is the great cen- tral fact of American life . It is the constitution of liberty and self-government , the frame and arena of all American politics . It gives laws their legitimacy and cloaks public office with public authority . The republic is what Americans founded when they founded America . The nation , by comparison , is a poor , dim thing , for the nation is merely America conceived as a corporate unit , a hollow shell . The flag is its emblem , " Uncle Sam " is its nickname ; yet there is virtually nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstract entity to life . It is not the people writ large , the way it is , say , in France or Iran . Americans are not fellow nationals , we are fellow citizens . As G. K. Chesterton rightly remarked after paying a visit , America is more a creed than a country , and the creed is republicanism . The ties of a common nationality do not bind Americans together and never did . Even when the overwhelming majority of Americans were of English descent the very act that created America was a solemn declaration of independence from mere ties of nationality . Spurning nationality is our deepest political experience as Americans . I used to wonder as a child why the Boston Tea Party rebels dressed up as red Indians . It seemed a queer thing to do , since the rebels , by and large , were not fond of Indians . Now I see what they meant . The tea dumpers were rebelling not only against English rule but also against English nationality . They were either free citizens or rude savages , but " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love of the nation , mistakenly called nationalism , does not spring from nationality in America . It is not the flame that once burned in the hearts of stateless Poles and colonized Irishmen , that once fired Italians with a dream of political unity . We were citizens of the republic long before we ever saw ourselves as members of a nation . In the early days of the republic , the very word nation , innocuous in itself , actually offended fastidious republicans . They detected an aroma of despotism about it , and they were not , it turns out , all that far wrong . We have traveled a long way since then , but devotion to the nation in America is still , inherently , devotion to an abstract entity . Orators at American Legion conventions rail the sentiment " old-fashioned patriotism , " but American memories are short . Devotion to the nation ? " nationism . " I will call it ? is not very old in America . In 1852 Abraham Lincoln lauded his hero Henry Clay for being a patriot in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " partly because it was his own country , but mostly because it was a free country . " To love America because you cherish the constitution of liberty is republican patriotism ? what the distinguished law firm cared nothing about . To love America because America helped rear you Lincoln took to be merely natural ; but nationism is not even patriotism of this natural kind . Natural patriotism is personal and concrete . It is love not of an entity but of things familiar and formative . During World War II a much-repeated story went around about the GI slogging through Italy 's mud who was asked what he thought he was fighting for . He was fighting , he said , for Mom 's apple pie , hot dogs , and the right to cheer the Brooklyn Dodgers . It sounded childish at the time , and it was . Natural patriotism is childlike . At bottom it is scarcely more than love of one 's own childhood . There is nothing childlike about nationism , however , and nothing natural about it . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hard to prove in a paragraph . but occasionally history recovers from the past a forgotten voice that reveals with wonderful economy the historical novelty of the new . One such voice was an angry editorial published by the New York Journal of Commerce in the year 1895 . What aroused the ire of the newspaper was what it called " the artificial patriotism being worked up at the present time . " And how was it being " worked up , " this fabricated patriotism that was neither natural nor republican ? Through the new and , to the Journal of Commerce , repugnant " fashion of hanging the flag from every schoolhouse and giving the boys military drill . " America was well into its second century before those in authority thought patriotism required flagpoles on schools . For that matter we were well into our second century before anyone thought patriotism required schoolchildren to pledge allegiance to the flag . The first time the pledge was ever recited in a classroom was in 1892 . Until then the only civilian American required to swear fealty to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pledged himself to " preserve , protect , and defend " not the nation . which has no legal existence , but the Constitution . The paraphernalia of nationism is quite new . Even flag-worship is new . In the late nineteenth century " Old Glory " was indeed a popular emblem . so popular that merchants used it to hawk corsets , cough drops , and player pianos . There was nothing sacred then about the flag , precisely because the cult of the nation did not yet exist . The elaborate etiquette that now surrounds the national regalia was not concocted until 1923 , the handiwork of the War Department and the newly formed American Legion . The object of the flag code was to transform the country 's banner into a semi-holy talisman and so give the abstraction called the nation a semblance of life . No doubt the War Department half succeeded . When certain anti ? Vietnam War protesters wanted to enrage their fellow citizens they burned American flags , proving how caught up in the flag cult , one way or another , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrifying introduction to the more recondite aspects of twentieth-century flag-worship . It occurred at a Boy Scout meeting in April , 1946 , when the scoutmaster asked the assembled tenderfoots what we were supposed to do when the family'sflag had grown tattered and unseemly . Throw it in the garbage , yelled one young heathen with no future in scouting . If you did that , the scoutmaster replied in hushed and portentous tones , you would be arrested and sent to prison . Fear and awe swept over us at the thought that an ordinary little flag ? private property your father might have bought at a Woolworth 's ? could bring down upon you the majestic wrath of the all-seeing American Government , a thunderbolt , as it were , from Mount Olympus . The scoutmaster was exaggerating , but not by much . What he did not tell us. however , was that the law you broke by rudely disposing of a tattered flag did not originate in the misty , immemorial past . It had been enacted by Congress just four years before , in 1942 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation ? " the artificial patriotism " of 1895 ? the mummery of flag-worship played its part , but the part is minor . It took far more than sacred bunting and schoolroom pledges to transform a lifeless abstraction rooted in nothing , springing from nothing , legally nonexistent ? into the powerful rival of the venerable American republic . What it took was the whole weight and force of American foreign policy since the late nineteenth century . The reason for this is quite simple . The American nation , which has no life at home beyond what bunting will impart , comes to life internationally , for only in active dealings with other 1 countries does the abstract entity , the nation . t genuinely act as an entity . The republic exists 1 " - ; for its own sake . The American nation lives cd abroad , and nationism in America is always a species of internationalism . Once , on a radio discussion show , the moderator , vexed with me for " tearing down America , " began delivering a long harangue about the horrors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited . How then , he asked in conclusion , could anyone really criticize American politics when you compare our freedom with Tito 's repressions ? That is the true international voice of the nationist . He extols liberty in America by comparing it with despotism abroad . The republican , by contrast , compares liberty in America with one standard only , the one established in the principles and promise of the American republic itself . To the nationist , new-fashioned patriot of the twentieth century , America is always a nation among nations . It is most fully a nation , most intensely alive as an entity , when it wages war against other nations . Even in peacetime it is the memory of past wars and the menace of future wars that keep the idea of the nation alive in America . War and the cult of the nation are virtually one and the same . That is why the " artificial patriotism " of 1895 included " giving the boys military drill " ; why it was the War Depart . ment that promoted the flag code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displays ; why the veterans ' organizations are the most strenuous guardians of nationismAmerica , to the Legionnaire , is America at war , the war in which he himself served . Therein lies the radical distinction between patriotism and the cult of the nation . Americans needed no wars to love their country because it was their own ; still less did they need war to love their country because it was free . It is the artificial patriotism of the nation that requires war , for without war the nation is but a shade wrapped in hunting . Not many Americans love war for its own sake . Indeed , the only .. enuinely popular war we ever fought was the Spanish-American War , partly because it lasted only a few months . In America the cult of the nation does not exalt military glory . What it exalts are the repressive virtues of wartime . What it cloaks with patriotic ardor is hostility toward the virtues of a republic at peace . During the two years preceding America 's entry into World War I ? a war that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of ? those who favored intervention actually set forth in a fierce pamphleteering agitation the virtues they hoped war would instill in postwar America . Mindful that nationism was still in its infancy ( whipping a fifth-rate power in 1898 had helped , but not much ) , the pamphleteers wanted war to " forge a national soul " for America , which apparently had no " soul " since it was just a venerated republic . They hoped war would give birth to -a new religion of vital patriotism ? that is , of consecration to the State , " a consecration sadly lacking in the republic , like the very concept of America as a " State . " Mindful that the nation can only live abroad , they hoped an overseas war would permanently imbue Americans with " a strong sense of international duty . " Otherwise the nation would fade from our minds . Above all , they wanted war to bring about a " change in the whole attitude of the people toward government . " It would teach the rising generations , seared by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what they " owed " to their rulers and less about what they could " get " from them . It would teach them , too , a " wholesome respect " for the powerful . The result would he a postwar America that would enjoy , the interventionists said , the blessings of " complete internal peace . " The interventionists of 1916 wanted war to bring forth a new America ? the second America ? conceived in trench warfare and dedicated to the proposition that a few should rule and the rest should serve . Citizens of the republic would be transformed into docile agents of the American " State . " A people taught for 150 years to guard and cherish its liberties would learn , instead , to guard and cherish the " national soul . " An exacting and troublesome citizenry I which Americans had been during the years between 1890 and 1916 ) would henceforth ask no more of its governors than the humble opportunity to serve their international objectives . A " new religion " of nation-ism would eclipse and even supplant the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point , the Archimedcan point , of the interventionist enterprise . Among liberal intellectuals a few years ago , it was fashionable to deride the popular American " cult of the Constitution . " They thought it a bulwark of " reaction " and the American people , by implication , the dupes of the rich . The interventionists of 1916 knew better . It was the cult of the Constitution that they wished to obliterate and the cult of the nation that they hoped to erect in its place , through a titanic foreign war ? the only possible way of doing it . As Bertolt Brecht once said . If the rulers can not get along with the people they will just have to elect a new people . The virtues of the citizen-turned-nationist would be simple , logical , and straightforward . For the sake of the nation , whose strength abroad demands " complete internal peace , " he would do all that " internal peace " requires . He would forgo the exercise of his liberties ? to speak , to act , to voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likewise , for the sea of liberty is turbulent and weakens the nation in the performance of its " international duties . " For the sake of internal peace he would rest content with his lot and cease dividing the counsels of the powerful with selfish demands upon his government . In domestic affairs he would mind his own business and ask for nothing . In foreign affairs he would mind everyone else 's business and call hotly for action . Eternal vigilance , liberty 's steep price , he would willingly abandon because only a people that shows " confidence " in its rulers can provide them with the power to act forcefully abroad . Mutual respect , which citizens pay to each other simply because they are fellow citizens , he would replace with the patriotism of mutual suspicion ? " positive polarization , " as a Presidential Administration was to call it fifty-five years later . His own " vital patriotism " he would display by condemning as " disloyal " and " un-American " those who still cherished the republic and still fought to preserve and perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by critical words , he would undertake to root out among his neighbors ( " America ? Love it or leave it ! " ) , although officially no such crime exists in America . Such was the new-modeled citizen envisioned by the warmongers of 1916 and extolled ever since by the promoters of nationism . An indestructible republic HE AGITATORS of 1916 did not go un-answered , for the republic had not yet been eclipsed . We had not yet reached the stage , for example , at which a respected political commentator describing " America as a civilization " could call the Con-stitution at most " a " symbol " of national unity , a flag made of parchment . Despite the agitators ' fine talk about fighting in Europe for " democracy against autocracy , " their crit-ics ( who spoke for the great majority of Americans ) were not deceived . They under-stood quite clearly that the interventionists wanted to establish a deadly rival to the Amer-ican republic and a fount of new virtues that snuffed out republican virtues . The war agita-tion itself , said one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a colossal blood-stained monument marking the turning point in the life of this Government . " And he was right . If we enter the European war , said another antiwar Senator , William J. Stone of Missouri , " we will never again have this same old republic . " And he , too , was right . What the interventionists wanted , their critics said , was a " Prussianized " America , an America whose citizens no longer loved their country because it was free but merely because it was feared . The critics ' voices have long been forgotten , but like the angry editorial in the Journal of Commerce they reveal in their quaint , out-of-date language the historical novelty of the way we live now . The novelty has long since worn off . In 1916 only a handful of Americans dared call openly for a " change in the whole attitude of the people toward government . " Forty-five years and three foreign wars later , it was an American President , freshly sworn in , who was hailed for telling his fellow citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them but to ask what they could do for their country while it paid " any price , " bore " any burden , " met " any hardship " to defend liberty abroad . Sixty-one years after 1916 another President , newly inaugurated , warned his fellow citizens that the chief " crisis " facing America was their lack of " confidence " in their betters . In the corridors of power the promoters of nationism are triumphant . Understandably they trust and advance only their own kind . When the Nixon Administration was shopping around for a new legal counsel to the President , a bright young attorney working for the House Judiciary Committee caught the eye of the White House . Searching scrutiny certified him as a loyal , unblemished patriot who met the stringent requirements of the highest level of security clearance ( something not required for any government service until World War II ) . And what did this eminently trustworthy young patriot believe ? That an American President had the right to do whatever he could get away with . Had the young attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FBI have " cleared " him ? I doubt it . For the past twenty-five years the FBI , which , like the nation , first blossomed in World War I , has kept a secret file on the American Civil Liberties Union in Chicago , an allegedly " disloyal " organization . That assessment reveals much about the two Americas . Disloyal to the republic the ACLU certainly is not , since its chief activity is providing legal aid to citizens whose constitutional rights have been violated . Is it disloyal to the nation ? Of course it is . Citizens active enough to require government infringement of their rights obviously disrupt the nation 's " internal peace . " Who but the disloyal would think it a duty to defend them ? There is nothing illogical about nationism . Much of its strength in the country derives from its simple logic . w HAT CONFOUNDS and unnerves the nationist is the indestructible fact of the American republic . He lives in enemy territory among a people still only half-conquered . That is one reason why J. Edgar Hoover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reassuring image ? efficient yet politically innocuous ? of the FBI . He did n't do so because he thought Americans would inevitably admire his G-men . Nobody labors to achieve the inevitable . On the contrary , Hoover feared that **25;3336;TOOLONG just might revert back again . So long as the republic endures , nothing can wholly prevent that reversion . The great historian of ancient Rome Theodor Monunsen once observed that a republic founded by popular consent exerts an authority over its citizens so strong , so pervasive , so intimately entwined 1 with their lives that the citizenry can not even imagine a life outside its sway . So it is with the American republic . If nationism runs strong in the country ? and it does ? the hearts of Americans are nonetheless divided , like the country in which we now live . Until 1965 the division of our hearts , part nationist , part republican , lay concealed under the crushing weight of a quarter-century of war and continual foreign crisis . Then something happened . The nationists in power overreached themselves . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war in Asia launched a massive war in Asia and left the poor as poor as ever . To his shock and dismay . divided American hearts did not " rally to the flag . " There was no outpouring of nationist sentiment . A magazine writer visiting Kansas in 1967 described the strange war temper in what was soon to be called " Middle America . " On the one hand , not a single Kansas town had played host to an antiwar demonstration . On the other , local draft boards were cheerfully deferring every youth who offered any plausible grounds for deferment . Angry moral arguments against the war played little part in producing that surprisingly tepid response ? a response that no contemporary poll could detect . What lay behind it was a profound sense of political betrayal . A President had promised peace and given us war , had committed a gross breach of faith and treated his countrymen with sovereign contempt . We were not nationists enough to cheer the fruits of a betrayal so deep ; we were still republican enough to resent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the faithless President was peacefully driven from power . Six years later , another President , as lawless as his predecessor had been faithless , discovered , too , that Americans were not nationist enough to " stand by " a President for the sake of the nation , that we were still republican enough to resent the lawlessness of the mighty . He , too , was peacefully driven from power . A half-conquered people had asserted , if only in a negative way , their old republican patriotism . There were still limits to what even **26;3363;TOOLONG would tolerate , and they were republican limits , so deeply American that Europeans , nationists to their marrow , could not even begin to fathom the events of that riotous decade . In those events the profound antagonism between nation and republic at last stood fully revealed . That Americans would not tolerate faithless or lawless Presidents should have been grounds for modest rejoicing . I think the American people did rejoice ? in private . I think we did take quiet pride in acting , for once , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure of public happiness in seeing the ponderous machinery of the Constitution set in motion for a republican end . What else can explain the extraordinary outpouring of good feeling on July 4 , 1976 , a celebration of the birth of the Republic that turned the strife-torn streets of New York into a scene of tumultuous good will and mutual respect so palpable it seemed for a few sweet hours that republican patriotism had had a rebirth ? In the corridors of power where nationists congregate , there was no rejoicing whatever . That the " religion of vital patriotism " had not entirely snuffed out republican sentiment in America brought only wringing of hands , gnashing of teeth , and dire warnings of imminent disaster . Americans had refused to rally behind a war treacherously begun and dubiously justified . What was that , the nationists say , but proof of the people 's lack of " will " and " resolve " to fulfill their " international duty " ? as if only the powerful were licensed to define our duties . Americans had refused to let two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that . the nationists say , but a dangerous " weakening of the Presidency " ? as if Presidential despotism alone kept America intact . Americans had shaken off their political torpor and participated in public affairs . What was that , a future aide of President Carter wrote in 1975 , but a perilous want of " deference " in the American people ? as if servility ( pronounced " civility " by so-called nen-conservatives ) could possibly he a virtue in a republic constituted for selfgovernment . Americans had exercised keen vigilance over the powerful . What was that , the nationists say , but a national " crisis of confidence " as if the powerful enjoyed a divine right to our trust . To impugn the republican virtue of vigilance , the nationists even coined a new name for it . They called it " post-Watergate morality , " as if submission to corrupt power and blind faith in one 's leaders were the old , the hallowed morality . like the " old-fashioned patriotism " of the American Legion . Every republican virtue that surfaced so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rival virtues of wartime , have by now obliquely condemned . They are still trying to elect a new people . The energizing principle 0 FFSPR1NG OF WAR , the cult of the nation is itself a weapon of political warfare , the undeclared war waged by the powerful few against the political vitality of the American republic . It is the only popular weapon they have . The republic can not be destroyed ? its collapse would bring ruin to all . Its legitimacy can not be subverted ? it is the source of all legitimacy in America . Even today the elementary maxims of the republic can not be defied with impunity , as President Nixon learned to his regret . The moment he claimed to stand above the laws his political doom was in sight . Too many Americans still remembered the copybook rule : " We are a government of laws , not of men . " Americans , I think , can even distinguish in a general way the few genuine heroes of the republic from the common herd of famous leaders . In Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undeserving ? think of the Sam Rayburn Building and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts ? Congress has not yet dared to create more than three major monuments : to Washington , to Jefferson , and to Lincoln , the two great founders and the one great savior of the American republic . Still , that does not add up to much . The republic is more than the form of our government plus a few rudimentary maxims and memories . It embodies a profound principle of political action ? an " energizing " principle , as Jefferson called it . It is supposed to operate at all times and under all conditions against oligarchy , special privilege , and arbitrary power . The energizing principle is the preservation and perfecting of self-government . the securing to each citizen of an equal voice in his own government . That grand object , as Lincoln once said , we must as republicans constantly strive for , constantly try to " approximate " even if we can never perfectly achieve it . Without its energizing principle a republic becomes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet it is a truly burdensome principle to live by . It is easier to be servile than free , easier to submit to the rule of a few than to keep up the endless struggle for self-rule . It is easier to fight enemies abroad than to fight for the republic at home . That is why the virtue of virtues in a republic , as Montesquieu long ago observed , is the citizens ' love of the republic ? " to be jealous of naught save the republican character of their country , " as the Workingmen 's party put it 150 years ago when it campaigned for free public schools in America . That is why the enemies of popular self-government have striven to erect and strengthen the rival cult of the nation , by war if possible , by the menace of war when there is a perilous lull in the fighting . It is the only way to undermine the people 's love of the republic and subvert among the citizenry themselves its energizing principle . In the name of the nation , that undermining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing never taught in our free public schools is - to be jealous of naught save the republican character " of our country . In my own schooldays we learned more about Betsy Ross and the wonders of the Panama Canal than we did about Abraham Lincoln , whose birthday is no longer celebrated in a dozen states that once paid his memory that homage . Above all , it is the reason why what old Henry Cabot Lodge called the " large " foreign policy the policy of having a busy foreign policy ? has governed our foreign affairs for so many long years . It is precisely the " large " policy that keeps the nation alive and the republic in twilight . After forty consecutive years of war and rumor of war ? one-fifth the republic 's entire span of existence ? it is a wonder , perhaps , that republican virtues survive at all . That they do bears witness to the awesome authority of our republican foundations , since almost nothing else in contemporary America keeps them alive . What has not survived is honest political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suhverters of the republic hunt down " subversives , " and enemies of the republican principle decide who is and who is not " un-American . " We describe as " old-fashioned patriots " those who warn us that American liberties endanger the nation , and the " religion of vital patriotism ? that is , of consecration to the State , " nonexistent in 1916 , is the " neo-conservatism " of 1979.
