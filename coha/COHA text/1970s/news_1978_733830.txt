txt With Secretary of State Cyrus Vance off to Saudi Arabia and Jordan ( right ) , President Carter seems to be making headway in harnessing inflation at home ( below ) . Meanwhile , Mr. Carter 's role as peacemaker appears to be winning him points politically in the South and among Democrats seeking re-election in November , such as New York Gov . Hugh Carey ( Page 3 ) . President Carter 's success in the Camp David talks boosts his lagging popularity in the South ? an area where he must win a substantial number of electoral votes to repeat his 1976 presidential victory . But , at best , it aids him only indirectly on other issues important to the South . This assessment from some of the nation 's Southern governors comes as they grope for ways to cope with inflation and unemployment as well as problems peculiar to their home states . In their reaction to progress on the Middle East and in their interest in inflation and jobs , the concerns these governors voice sound less Southern and more national than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the one going on here . " They 're not Southern issues ? they 're na-tional , " says Gov . David Pryor ( D ) of Ar-kansas . Though Arkansas gave President Carter one of his largest state majorities in 1976 , he has been in some political trouble there ? he is seen as floundering , lacking answers , and as too much of a " good ol ' boy , " Governor Pryor explained between sessions here . Camp David may be the " turn of events " the President needs , Mr. Pryor said . Camp David " certainly will help " Mr. Carter in Texas , says Gov . Dolph Briscoe Jr. , a Democrat critical of the President 's energy program . Even Republican Gov . . John N. Dalton of Virginia says Mr. Carter 's performance at Camp David " will probably help him " in that state . But , he adds , it is " just one issue , " and inflation is the " No. 1 concern . " That concern is shared by the other Southern governors , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inflation at home seem more immediate and worrisome than Middle East tensions , though the two may be related . ( Dr. Alan Greenspan , chairman of former President Ford 's Council of Economic Advisers , says Mideast peace could remove the uncertainty of oil supply for the United States , thus boosting confidence in the U.S. and dampening inflation . ) So while the Middle East continued to dominate the news nationally , the governors here wrestled with such topics as the impact of inflation , why industries move to certain states , and how the national energy bill would affect their states . In addition , each governor has issues of special interest to him . Gov . James B. Hunt Jr . ( D ) of North Carolina , expressed concern for the " new generation " in need of health care and education . Governor Briscoe argues that the Carter plan for natural gas pricing would discourage adequate new drilling . Governor Pryor wants more export markets for rice ( his state produces 40 percent of U.S. rice , he says ) . And Gov . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how long the nation 's stable middle class will be patient with inflation before it " becomes radicalized . " There was a conservative mood in the air here , as one speaker after another from private industry called for tax cuts and criticized the expanding federal government .
