MAGIC <P> Directed by Richard Attenborough <P> Screenplay by William Goldman <P> The people behind this clinker are the same gang who only last year concocted A Bridge Too Far . It 's just possible that they are in the wrong line of work . Bridge was a long and costly war movie that never clearly indicated who was winning its pivotal battle . Magic is a thriller that gives away its one and only surprise in the opening scenes . Maybe next year Producer Joe Levine , Director Richard Attenborough and Writer William Goldman will create a musical without songs . Or a western set in Paris . With these guys , the possibilities are endless . <P> Certainly Magic is endless , especially if one has seen Dead of Night , Psycho or any of the other horror movies it ineptly rips off The film tells the story of a psychotic ventriloquist ( Anthony Hopkins ) whose dummy " orders " him to kill . For two hours the audience must unwillingly suspend disbelief while the other characters take their sweet time in unmasking the villain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieve the intervening tedium . <P> When a film is as wrongheaded as this one , it is hard to know which flaws are the most damaging . Perhaps one begins with the lethargic Attenborough , who has managed to miscast the film 's central role Hopkins can not even begin to pass for the New York-bred , borscht-circuit entertainer Magic claims him to be . <P> Then there is Goldman 's script , which refuses to make up in wit what it lacks in thrills Goldman chooses instead to litter his dialogue with allegedly with-it references ( from Steve Martin to the Four Seasons restaurant ) , as if sheer name drop ping might pass for sophistication . <P> Perhaps Magic 's worst sin , though , is that of viciousness . While there is nothing wrong with violence in movies , there is a great deal amiss when a film exists for the sole purpose of showing gruesome murders . Even in show biz , it is not necessary to sink quite so low to make a buck . <P> The one person who emerges unscathed from the fiasco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hopkins ' idiotic high school sweetie ) , this actress works hard to bring warmth to a film that abhors humanity as much as nature does a vacuum . It is also a pleasure to see that time is treating her uncommonly well : the new lines on her face only add to her beauty In a movie that otherwise mocks its title , Ann-Margret really is magic . <P> - Frank Rich
