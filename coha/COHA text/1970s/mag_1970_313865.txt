Not long ago , people went up to the attic to stow clutter away . Today they bring it down . Nostalgia and its bastard cousin , camp , have transformed debris into antiques , and trivia into gold . In the Hollywood attic , two losers have been moldering for over a year , waiting for a miracle that would render them profitable . The leftovers are Fearless Frank and Madigan 's Millions , and the miracle is Midnight Cowboy , which reinforced the reputation of Dustin Hoffman and elevated Jon Voight from a cipher into a star with a six-figure salary . This month American International Pictures , with the calculation of a jeweler digging out his stock of Mickey Mouse watches , is distributing a double bill that brings the boys together again for the first time . <P> Fearless Frank is a comic strip brought to life in all two dimensions . In the title role , Voight plays a Supermanic hero and his Frankensteinian twin . Occasionally , he perks up enough to look lobotomized ; the rest of the time he second-fiddles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only player who truly understands this kind of cartoon is not the blond , bland star but Severn Darden , a refugee from Chicago 's improvisational Second City troupe . Darden portrays a mad doctor who would seem far more at home speaking balloons than lines . <P> As for Hoffman , he was airlifted from off-Broadway to Rome for Madigan 's Millions and given a fast $5,000 for his first film role as a fumbling , bumbling G-man . Today he could light his cigars with bills of that size-and may be tempted to put his screen debut to the same use . At first glance , he can hardly be blamed . The movie 's garish color and lighting would give an aspirin a headache , and its flubbed , dubbed screenplay is sheer , towering Babel . Yet here and there are some amusing hints of the ludicrous student who became the Graduate . <P> Beyond the simple history and mild comedy that its twin bill offers Hoffman-Voight fans , American International Pictures deserves an additional salute from the industry . Eyes fixed on the rear-view mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devised a unique way to greet the ' 70s , ringing in the now by wringing out the old .
