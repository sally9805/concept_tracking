As Dartmouth began its 203rd year with a convocation in Webster Hall , President John George Kemeny professed himself ready to " risk chaos by moving forward with new ideas . " Dartmouth 's most striking new idea was already a reality : the college 's first 252 coeds . In their honor , Kemeny asked the students to refrain from singing the traditional Men of Dartmouth ( " Men of Dartmouth , / give a rouse , for the college on the hill ... " ) . Instead , they sang a verse of Dartmouth Undying ( " Remember/ the splendor and fullness of her days ... " ) . But then from students in the gallery came a touch of chaos , a faint chant of " Men of Dartmouth , give a rouse ... " <P> So died , with a failing gurgle of protest , one of the Ivy League 's oldest and least-mourned traditions : Dartmouth was the last of the eight schools to go coed . The reform came through the efforts of a man who is himself something of a novelty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buff who still speaks English with a thick Hungarian accent . As the chaos of rival songs faded away , John Kemeny just smiled : bringing women to Dartmouth had been one of his chief goals since he took over as president two years ago . " Dartmouth was incomplete without women , " he says . " The environment without them was unnatural , and therefore education was handicapped . " <P> Lemons . Once the alumni 's diehard prejudices had been overcome , the college 's chief problem was to find a way to admit women without cutting its male enrollment , since Dartmouth could not afford to increase its physical plant . Kemeny 's solution was typically pragmatic : he is adding a summer term , which will allow the school to enroll 800 women students over the next four years at a cost of only $2,000,000 , mostly for renovation of dorms , expanding the gym , and adding 25 teachers to the present 275-member faculty . Under the new system , only the freshman year is traditional , fall to spring . After that , Dartmouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer term ; he can take his other seven ten-week terms at any time he wishes , either at Dartmouth itself or at 27 other study centers in the U.S. and abroad . <P> In the course of restructuring Dartmouth-while keeping his budgets balanced-Kemeny has brought a new and more approachable style to his office . He frequently works in a collarless sports shirt ; he teaches a freshman calculus course ; and he sets aside time every week for students to come in without any appointment and talk . When the superconservative Manchester ( N.H. ) Union Leader called the new president a " lemon " ( because he canceled classes during the Kent State upheaval ) Kemeny good-naturedly tossed out lemons at a subsequent mass meeting of students , many of whom were wearing polo shirts painted with bright yellow lemons . Kemeny can also be blunt . A delegation of professors once protested against his bringing his wife Jean to faculty meetings . " Go to hell , " he told them . Soon afterward the meetings were thrown open to all the wives , students and university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
