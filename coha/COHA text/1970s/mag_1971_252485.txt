Senator Edmund Muskie felt tired and ill . His replies on a television show were cold and argumentative , and one of his aides , Berl Bernhard , bluntly told Muskie that it was a bad performance . When Muskie publicly berated his staff for a bad press release , Bernhard protested firmly that such scoldings were not " particularly productive . " The Senator scowled , then smiled . " Look , Nag , " Muskie told Bernhard , " I 'll stop knocking the staff if you 'll stop telling the press I 'm contentious and ill-tempered . " <P> Last week Muskie selected Bernhard , 41 , to direct his still unannounced presidential campaign . " There may be some people who feel they have to cushion me when there is unpleasant news , but they are wrong , " says Muskie . " Berl does n't cushion anything with me . " A successful Washington lawyer both in and out of Government , Bernhard has a knack for employing humor to take the sting out of his stern judgments . " He will cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , " contends one close friend , " but he uses plenty of anaesthesia . " Muskie prefers a woodsy Maine metaphor to explain Bernhard 's style : " Even a moose has velvet on its horns part of the year . " <P> A native of New York City and a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Dartmouth , Bernhard earned his law degree from Yale . He served as a Washington law clerk to Federal Judge Luther W. Youngdahl , a former Republican Governor of Minnesota . Joining the newly-created U.S. Civil Rights Commission in 1958 , Bernhard became its staff director in 1961 and effectively gathered evidence of unfair treatment of blacks in the South . <P> Bernhard first met Muskie while serving as general counsel to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in 1967 . Muskie , then heading the committee , impressed Bernhard with his succinct definition of duties : " All I want to know from you is if what we are doing is proper and lawful . " The two have enjoyed an uncomplicated rapport during Muskie 's political forays ever since . Bernhard served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice presidential campaign . <P> In his new job , one of Bernhard 's toughest tasks will be fund raising . He figures Muskie will need $1,500,000 before the presidential primaries begin next year , possibly $8,000,000 to compete in those elections , then another $25 million if he wins the nomination . Meanwhile , he wants Muskie to maintain a low profile while he bones up on the potential 1972 issues . <P> The Muskie campaign needs a skilled director . His staff was unprepared for the candidate 's unusually fast start , and scheduling details have sometimes gone awry . Bernhard must also avoid two conflicting dangers that threaten the front runner : overexposure that could bore voters before the primaries , and an overly cautious approach to issues that might feed the contention of critics that Muskie is indecisive.
