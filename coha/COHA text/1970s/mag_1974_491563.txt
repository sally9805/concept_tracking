Editor 's Note : The story of Frank Costello , Ameri  --  ca 's mastermind of the underworld up until his death only last year , is that of a curiously gifted man , without a doubt a business genius of the first order  --  except that his business was crime . In Part I of this two-part sequence , drawn from a new and dramatically revealing book about Costello , told by the legal counsel who advised him for thirty years through mazes of legal entanglements , we learned of Costello 's birth in 1896 in Sicily , his ar  --  rival in New York City 's uptown slums at the age of six , and of his subsequent rise to fame and riches as a bootlegger who fought the United States Coast Guard on the open seas . Frank Costello actually owned his own fleet of rum-running freighters and speedboats and even wielded an air arm , a wing of planes , when air power was still something of a mil  --  itary novelty . The take was huge ; even his under  --  lings were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at astronomical prices . Prohibition was the key to Costello . On Janu  --  ary 16 , 1920 , the National Prohibition Amend  --  ment became law  --  and launched Frank Costello into big business . Before that he had been a small  --  time crook , starting from his very first venture which culminated in a " most successful bankrupt  --  cy . " The public had swallowed that law without considering very much in advance what it might mean to the national habit of social drinking . Con  --  sequently , when Costello chose the smuggling of bootleg liquor as the best means to making a for  --  tune , citizens encouraged him to break the law for everybody 's benefit . There was tacit connivance on all sides , even some on the part of the author  --  ities , to look the other way and let the liquor come in , even accept the fabulously high prices as part of the glamorous game of living dangerously and recklessly . Costello , the mobster with the mind of a top executive and a head for figures like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost that ofa Robin Hood who fought the establishment for the sake of the common good . His long career had many high points . He defied Congress and the Kefauver Committee . He was said to run New York City by controlling its offi  --  cials . He even managed to win a verdict of " inno  --  cent " in a trial accusing him of  --  imagine ! ? boot  --  legging . But perhaps the greatest indication of the raw power he enjoyed was right in the heart of the mob , as the boss of the Mafia . In a sequence in this fascinating new book his attorney tells how Cos  --  tello faced the challenge of the most feared mob  --  ster of them all , Chicago 's boss Al Capone . Frank 's success in " beating the rap " when ev  --  eryone in the underworld knew he was guilty was a turning point in his career . The mystique of Frank Costello grew . By then he was a millionaire , with business booming . His businesslike methods of operation made many Mafia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets his share , " was Frank 's often-quoted motto . But prosperity was wreaking havoc in the Mafia at the same time . Too much money was at stake ; ambitious underworld chiefs quarreled and then assassinated and then quarreled again . Frank would have preferred to ignore this strange and fruitless warring . But he knew the violence , if it kept escalating , would eventually bring a public reaction far different from his popular support in the bootlegging . Bodies were falling all over Chicago as Al Ca  --  pone battled Dion O'Banion . In New York the Mafia chieftains were engaged in a mortal battle for supremacy . Frank knew he could save his own business and his own skin only by trying to medi ate their violent quarrels and by bringing the same efficient techniques he had used in bootlegging to the rest of the criminal world . At the moment none of the underworld chiefs wanted to listen . They were too busy plotting against each other 's lives . It has been suggested in the press that Frank Costello is " The Real Godfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Johnny Torrio , the Brooklyn boy who went to Chicago in 1920 , was the " Great-Godfather . " In fact , when Costello called together the great peace conference in Atlantic City 's Presi  --  dent Hotel in May 1929 , Torrio would be at his side as the conference 's " elder statesman . " It would be a conference that would come at the end of brought Al Capone to Chicago as his " muscle . " The " muscle " soon grew too strong for the " brain " which was supposed to control it . In fact . " Scarface " Al Capone was the symbol of what has been called the lawless decade . All through the Twenties it was Capone 's name that frightened ordinary citizens . And it was his city , Chicago , which got the name of Mobtown , a city so violent that even Lucky Luciano called it " a real crazy place . Nobody 's safe in the streets . " Because of Capone , Torrio would be a " man without a city " before the decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would be Frank Costello who saw that the violence in Chica  --  go would ruin the underworld in New York . En  --  raged officials and the citizenry at large made no nice distinctions between Chicago and New York gangsters . After Capone started killing , they want  --  ed all " gangsters " put away . And so it was Chicago which eventually forced Costello to abandon his hoped-for behind-the  --  scenes role and come to the forefront in under  --  world leadership . He was smart enough to know it was a question of survival , and when things were to // reach that point , Costello would show what a man , and what a diplomat , he was . The strange story begins with a phone call from the Chicago crime boss , Big Jim Colosimo , sometimes known as " Diamond Jim . " The call was to Johnny Torrio in Brooklyn , and the message was that Big Jim needed help . Big Jim Colosimo was having trouble with an outfit called the " Black Hand . " The members of this group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ izens with threats of kid  --  napping and murder . No one was sacred , not even the Boss of Crime . Torrio went to Chicago and within a few months had the situation under control . A few well-placed informers , some shots in the night , some bodies dis  --  appearing into Lake Mich  --  igan , and the Black Hand stopped troubling any  --  body . Big Jim was impressed with this " Eastern " talent , and he gave Johnny the go  --  ahead to import some more of his boys . One of the first men Johnny thought of was Al Capone , then a bouncer at Frankie Yale 's Harvard Inn on Long Island . He brought Ai to Chi  --  cago as his Lieutenant and bodyguard . For special jobs , where out-of-town talent would be needed , Torrio would use Frankie Yale . In those days Yale was regarded as a " coiner . " He was twenty-five years old and already was head of the Unione Sicilian ? , a charitable organization which included many Ital  --  ian gangsters . For profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor dispute ) with baseball bats , acted as a prizefight man  --  ager , and owned a stable of racehorses . But all of Yale 's busi  --  ness from racehorses to night clubs were secondary to the real reason for his success : violence . Frankie even owned his own fu  --  neral parlor to take care of the bodies . In May 1920 , Frankie Yale got a message from his old Brooklyn buddy , Johnny Torrio . The bloody underworld wars of the Twenties were about to begin and Frank Costello , fighting to stay out , would be in the middle of the climactic violence . As his bride Dale later told the story , on May 11 , 1922 , Big Jim Colosimo , Chicago 's Boss of all Bosses , got a telephone call that morning from Johnny Torrio , Jim 's lieutenant . After she handed the phone to her new husband Dale knew Torrio was bugging Jim . She could tell by the way the muscles in Jim 's cheeks were twitching , as they always did when he was irritated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truckloads at the club at four o'clock , " lie said . " Why ca n't Torrio take the delivery ? " Dale 1 // asked her new husband quizzically . " It 's a special shipment of whiskey from Canada . and the boys will deal only with me , " Jim said . Colosimo 's Cafe was the most famous night  --  club in the city . Movie stars , politicians , athletes , and celebrities from everywhere made it a point to stop there when they were in Chicago . The illegal booze was the best , beautiful girls abound  --  ed , and the prospect of rubbing shoulders with real gangsters was alluring . There , at night Jim reigned as the King , a giant of a man dressed in the height of fashion , with diamonds glinting from his " pinkies . " Stopping at tables with elegantly gowned ladies and tuxedoed men who were on a " slumming " tour , he would call for champagne on the house , while afar off on the stage his chorus girls kicked their pretty legs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray afternoon the Cate was practically deserted . Big Jim got there precisely at four p.m .. wearing a homburg hat and a bright red rose in his lapel . He found no trucks . Tired of waiting in the lobby , he went back into the club and found the assistant manager scurrying around while some cleaning ladies got ready for the evening 's rush . He chatted with the manager , but his ear was listening for the phone . Surely , Torrio would have called him if the shipment had been delayed for some reason . By 4:25 Jim was furious . He left the employ . ees , telling them he was going home . He walked past the deserted little tables of the club until he reached the door to the vestibule , then pushed the door open , and strode through the lobby toward the street exit . Frankie Yale came out of the cloakroom with a .38 pistol behind Jim and fired once , twice . The first bullet penetrated just beneath Big Jim 's right ear . His big body lurched sideways , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the porcelain tiles of the nightclub lobby , blood running gently from beneath his ear . A few hours later the Chicago police appre  --  hended Frankie Yale about to board a train bound for New York . Frank said he was in Chi  --  cago on a friendly visit , and the authorities , with no evidence , had to let him go . The boss was dead , and it was a death which would affect the career of Frank Costello , hun  --  dreds of miles away . For the new Boss , Johnny Torrio , would himself have trouble in the ranks , and in the end it would he Costello he would turn to . Big Jim Colosimo 's demise brought Johnny Torrio , who wept at his funeral , to power . Johnny , a dandy little fellow with dainty hands and feet , had hired a stocky , muscular Al Capone for the " heavy " work . Frank told me he liked Torrio . " He 's rea  --  sonable , " he always said . But Capone was an  --  other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all raking it in in the Twenties , " he said to me once , " and Capone 's got the Feds excited . For what ? Stay quiet , do your business , and everything 's set . " Capone 's first move as Torrio 's deputy was to take care of the leader of Chicago 's rival syn  --  dicate , headed by an Irishman named Dion O'Banion . O'Banion had an unusual " front " ? a florist shop from which he regularly sent out wreaths to demolished rivals , complete with cards stamped " Deepest regrets . " But the next wreath from that shop would be for his own funeral . On November 10 , 1924 , O'Banion was trimming some roses , humming softly , when a Cadillac sedan drew up to the curb outside . Out of it stepped an old friend . Frankie Yale , back in Chicago for another visit . He was accompanied by two heavyset men . O'Banion went to the door to greet them . " Hey , Frankie , " he said . " Long time no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straightening up some ferns . They had a big order for a wed  --  ding on the North Side that afternoon . O'Banion told the porter to go in the back room while he talked to his friends , surrounded by roses and peonies and chrysanthemums . O'Banion held out his hand to shake Frank  --  ie 's . The next thing he knew his hand was gripped like iron and his arm jerked forward , and he stumbled into Yale 's arms while the two other thugs on either side had pistols out , blazing bul  --  lets into his head . Dion O'Banion crashed among vases of white peonies , spraying them with drop  --  lets of blood . This hit against the rival chief of crime in Chicago was not Johnny Torrio 's idea  --  but Al Capone 's . It was Capone 's signal that he was in charge . Torrio tried to make peace across the city , but he was powerless . The war that broke out on Chicago 's streets claimed more than 500 lives before it was finished . Torrio , himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , on January 24 , 1925 , he made what he said to me years later was " a small mistake . " He helped his wife with sonic packages . Mrs. Ann Torrio said to her husband , " Take the two long boxes , John . Michael will be able to handle the rest . " They were standing in front of their apart  --  ment house , Michael , the chauffeur , reaching inside the limousine to get the packages Mrs. Torrio had bought that afternoon on a shopping trip . She and the chauffeur had picked Johnny up on the way home . Now Johnny said , " You strong enough , Mike ? " Mike came out of the car with four huge boxes . He said to his employer , " She bought half the fifth floor . " " 1 did not . " Ann laughed , as Johnny reached in and got the two remaining boxes . He cradled them in his arms , sideways . and the three of them in single file started walking toward the apartment house door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two men jumped out with machine guns , and a firestorm of bullets jerked Johnny 's body off his feet . The packages went flying . Bullets poured into his face , his chest , his groin , his arms . His wife screamed and began pulling him by the arms on his stomach toward the house . The two gunmen saw him inert , blood spurting from several wounds , turned and ran to the car where two getaway men waited . The wheels of the car spun on loose gravel , and the car roared off . Johnny , lying on the pavement , kept repeat  --  ing , " Mamma mia. mamma mia . " Johnny Torrio was wounded in so many places that three surgeons had to operate on three areas at once . Incredibly , the little man lived . Johnny managed to get two ideas across : One , he knew who had shot him but he would never tell . And two , he was retiring . Johnny Torrio left Chicago to Capone and came home to Brooklyn , a premature elder statesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York was Frank Costello . Frank set him up in a little bootlegging business . He could afford to be generous . With his far-flung bootlegging organization funneling millions into his pockets , Frank was already esteemed as the shrewdest  --  and the richest  --  gangster in New York . He was above those far-off Chicago feuds and the New York Mafia rivalries . But events were to catch him up in their swirl . In the mid-Twenties , the New York under  --  world was chaotic . It was a time when the Mafia was a small organization , and Jewish and Irish independent operators dominated the scene . Frank was then one of the sub-capos in Joe Masseria 's family in Man  --  hattan , the branch of the Mafia which was the larg  --  est and best organized . Others in the family were Salvatore Lucania ( Lucky Luciano ) , Vito Genovese , Albert Anastasia , Joe Ado  --  nis , Anthony Anastasia , Carlo Gambino and Willie Morett . Ciro Terranova. the " Artichoke King , " ruled the Bronx . Frank Yale held sway in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nold Rothstein , Dutch Schultz , Legs Diamond , Owney Madden and Bill Dwyer were the names the public knew as criminal leaders . The small , tightly knit Mafia was virtually unknown to the public . Joe Masseria , " The Boss of all Bosses , " lived most of his career in the shadows of these more glamorous names , and was probably happy to do so . Lucky Luciano , Num  --  ber Two man in the Mafia under Joe Masseria , had a lot in common with Frank Costello  --  at least on the surface . In his heyday I re  --  member he kept a suite in the Waldorf and , although he did n't frequent the East Side spots that Frank did . or make such an effort to be accepted by the " best " people , he did dress sharp  --  ly , and looked neat and well turned out . This , de  --  spite a disfiguring scar which ran from the corner of his right eye down to his chin . Frank once told me , " I never heard nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " And to the end of his days Luciano would snarl at newspaper  --  men who called him that . He despised the name " Lucky " because , in his opinion , there was no " luck " at all in the inci  --  dent which inspired the name . It was pure " Omer  --  ta , " the code of silence of the Mafia . Many romantic legends have sprung up about that event . What happened for certain was that Luciano was taken for a " ride " from which no one usually returns , and he somehow escaped alive at a lonely spot in the night on Staten Island . But not before , according to reports , he was hung by his thumbs , his face slashed by a knife , his feet burned with ciga  --  rettes , and an ice pick plunged into his body several times . An escape after this would surely merit the name " Lucky . " Of the men at the top in the Mafia in those early days , it was apparent that Luciano and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Costello was not . Lucky dealt in narcotics , Frank would n't touch them . Lucky had a string of whorehouses ( more a hobby than a vital source of income ) . Frank did n't fool with such triviali  --  ties . What brought these two different types of men together was necessity . Joe Masseria , the " Boss , " was a man who still clung to the tradi  --  tions of Sicily , and would someday launch a fool  --  ish and bloody war with a rival Sicilian sect . But even more immediate was the fantastic orgy of killings in Chicago by Johnny Torrio 's successor , Al Capone . Capone was on a rampage , killing everyone from Italian and Irish rivals to As  --  sistant District Attorneys . The public outcry was growing . Young J. Edgar Hoover called him Public Enemy Number One . And still the killings went on . On one memor  --  able occasion Capone invited three Sicilian leaders to a banquet at his Hawthorne Inn in Cicero , the Chicago suburb . After the banquet , complete with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and tied them to their chairs . Then Ca  --  pone took a baseball hat and methodically beat them to pulp . The corpses were found with hardly a bone unbroken . Such was the savagery of Al Capone . But now Capone was reaching even farther , right into New York . His Eastern representative was the ubiqui  --  tous Frank Yale . whose job was to make certain Capone 's bootlegging trucks got through from New York to Chicago . But , for some reason , in the late I920 's , fewer and fewer trucks seemed to be arriving in Chicago . Capone blamed it on Frankie  --  and Frankie did not exactly get a chance to defend himself , even at a kangaroo court . Instead , he took his car out for a Sunday ride in a pleasant residen  --  tial section of Brooklyn , but did not notice a sedan moving up alongside him . When he did , it was too late . A machine gun poked out of the open win  --  dow . The resulting fire not only killed Frankie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Less than eight months later , things came to a head in a warehouse on Chicago 's South Side . The occasion was a holiday . St. Valentine 's Day , 1929 . George " Bugs " Moran had inherited the O'Banion gang , and was causing AI Capone a little trouble . This time Al went for the whole ball game . Seven of Moran 's henchmen were lured into a garage to await a shipment of illegal liquor . A sedan pulled up with two uniformed " policemen " and three in plainclothes . The " policemen " lined the Moran men against the wall as if it were an arrest ; then the three others with tommy guns tore all seven apart with bullets . Bugs Moran was on his way to the garage when it happened , and thus escaped . But his cry to reporters rang as far as New York , " Only Ca  --  pone kills like that . " Frank Costello was worried . He waited ner  --  vously in the card room of the Neapolitan Club in Greenwich Village He was doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solitaire . Lucky Luciano came in the door . " Hey pod  --  ner , " he said , and took off his hat and skimmed it onto the couch . He grabbed a little folding chair and sat across from Frank . " The red queen , kid . You blind ? " Frank smiled and moved the red queen on the black king . Both of them saw the significance of the king . That was the man Lucky had just been to see , Joe " The Boss " Masseria . " What 'd the big man say ? " asked Frank . Lucky pulled out a cigarette , lighted it , then puffed smoke a minute . His swarthy face , with its vertical white scar , was impassive . He said , " No deal . " " Big surprise , " Frank said . He found an ace in the deck , and placed it at the head of the table . " I think AI scares him , " Lucky said . " I say we move without him . " Lucky looked surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , and the Boss ai n't invited ? Come on , Frank . " " I got an idea . " Frank said . " What we all need is a vacation in Atlantic City . " Frank once told me about that " vacation . " Atlantic City in the Twenties was the summer playground of New York . The great hotels on the famous boardwalk were fronted with dazzling white beaches on which girls paraded in bathing suits ending daringly above the knee while prosperous men smoked big cigars and thought indecent thoughts . Frank Costello sat on a bench on the board  --  walk in front of the Traymore Hotel , the sun shining brightly on this spring morning in 3929 . Beside hint , paunchy little Johnny Torrio was consulting a penciled list of names . " They 're all in , " he said to Frank . " Al brought Nitti and Guzik . " He handed the list to Frank , who scanned it . Last week he had sent invitations all over the country for this convention , and everybody was coining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solomon from Boston , John Lazia from Kansas City , Joe Bernstein and others from Detroit , Sam Lazar from Philadelphia  --  and most important , Al Capone and his boys from Chicago . With Frank from New York were Luciano , Joe Adonis. a Brooklyn don , Lepke , the king of the garment district rackets and Torrio . Later Frank strolled down the boardwalk and stopped in front of one of those windows where taffy was being made , the gleaming machine twisting and then cutting off chunks of the candy in front of your eyes . People inside at the counter were buying boxes of the taffy hand over fist , but Frank did n't go for it . Somebody tapped him on the shoulder , and he turned . It was Joe Adonis . Joe said , " Buy yourself a box . It may be your last meal . " " Tell me some more good news , " Frank said . The two of them walked away , Adonis with his arm around Frank 's shoulder , talking softly . He said , " Capone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . " " Yeah ? " " He 's thinking of leaving . " " He 'll stay , " Frank said . But in fact he was n't sure . Capone had been Frank 's big worry ever since he had gotten this idea for a peace conference to stop the wild killings which were bringing the government into the picture , and threatening everything they had built up . At this time Capone was earning ten million a year , owned a $250,000 home in Miami , and was sitting pretty . Frank was at the height of his power  --  and now he must use it . He had spent many nights talking to Luciano and Torrio about what should be done . They had agreed that a nationwide meeting of all the leaders of crime should be called . The ostensible purpose would be to establish some sort of working relationship between the mobs in control of the various regions of the country . But the hidden reason would be to stop the violence  --  and somehow clamp down on Al Capone , without starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was hap  --  pening ! But he was too late . Frank , Torrio and Luciano had been busy with the visiting dele // gations and found all of them were agreed that Capone should be stopped . Adonis and Frank were walking back toward their hotel when a chunky , smiling man sur  --  rounded by very tough guys came toward him . " Frank , I 've been looking for you . " It was Enoch " Nucky " Johnson , Atlantic City 's crime boss , and unofficial host of the crime convention . " What 's up ? " Frank asked . " I 'm going to make you famous , " Nucky said . " If 1 get famous with one more jury I 've had it , " Frank said . But he was smiling with Mucky a few minutes later when a newspaper photog  --  rapher took a picture of the two of them . The picture printed in the Atlantic City newspaper the next day was as good a signal as any to Al Capone that Frank was the real host here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Hotel , and it was quite pic  --  turesque . A crystal chandelier , dangled above the table , and rich mahogany table and chairs gleamed from recent polishing . Now the great criminal chiefs from around the nation sat uneasily , wondering what was going to happen . Near one end of the table the Chicago delegation sat , menacingly . Frank " The En  --  forcer " Nitti , Jake " Greasy Thumb " Guzik , and bodyguard Frank Rio flanked the glowering Al Capone . The New York delegation sat at the other end , Frank at the head . Torrio on his right . But Torrio , as the " elder statesman , " was the firstone on his feet . Cigar smoke curled to the ceiling as the gang leaders looked at the little man . Torrio said , " The reason we called this meeting is we have to get organized . Everybody 's working on his own , we got independent guys muscling in , and that 's got to stop . What we need is a combination around the country where ev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we all work with each other . " With this preface , he introduced Costello . Frank stood up and carefully kept his eyes away from Capone 's . He said , " The reason we got to organize is that we got to put ourselves on a business basis . That 's what we 're in ... a business . We got to stop the kind of thing that 's going on in Chicago right now . " Not a murmur in the room as Frank turned and looked directly at AI Capone , who returned the stare , impassively . Frank said , " You guys are shooting at each other in the streets and innocent people are getting killed , and they 're starting to squawk . If they squawk loud enough the Feds get off their tails and start cracking down . And you know what that means . We got a thing where millions of dollars can be made just getting people what they want . When I was on trial three years ago on the whiskey deal , all the people were behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But if you make the people afraid of you , then they 're going to turn the other way and start yelling at the government to clean usout . That means the Internal Revenue boys , the FBI , the Narcos , and every DA in the country . It ai n't worth it . " He paused . Everyone was half listening to him and half watching Al Capone 's reaction . Frank said , " From now on nobody gets killed without a commission 's saying so . Johnny and I have got a little piece of paper we want to show you . We 're going to have a national commission with every family represented , twenty-four by our count . No Boss will be at  --  tacked unless the commission says he has to go . And no button man gets hit without a hearing from his own Boss . " The old way  --  killing a guy who bugs you , or who 's in your way  --  is no good any longer . If we run our thing like a business , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we keep the fireworks going we 'll all he out of business in a year . " He sat down . Frank could see the other gangsters were impressed . Capone was waiting for his chance to speak . But before he could , Frank nudged Torrio and Capone 's former mentor got to his feet . He looked down the length of the table at Al . " You 're going to jail , Al . " " To what ? " Capone was smiling . " To jail . We have to smooth this thing over right now . You go hack to Chicago after that Valentine Day shoot-out , and O'Banion 's boys will be at war  --  and the heat will go higher and higher . We think you need a vacation , Unthinkable . Capone looked around the table at these men , none of them big enough to shine his shoes . And they were saying he should go to jail ! Nitti was leaning close to him and whisper  --  ing , " Stall them and let 's blow . " Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm supposed to laugh . " But the answer came from Frank Costello . " This ai n't a joke , Al . We got too much in  --  vested for you to ruin the gravy train . Make it easy on yourself . Think of a way . But we need you off at ' college ' until things cool down . " Al said angrily , " I 'll let you know , " and he and his boys moved out of the room , slam  --  ming the door behind them . And so , two days later in Philadelphia , a remarkable event occurred . Al Capone , the untouchable , who had ordered the murders of more than a hundred men , Capone who had never been arrested , was picked up in Phila  --  delphia for " carrying a gun . " He and a body  --  guard , Frank Rio , were taken into custody as they walked out of a movie theater at 19th and Market Streets . The arresting officers were Detective James ( Shooey ) Malone and John Creedon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprisonment for carrying concealed weapons . The legendary " Scarface " became num  --  ber 90725 in the Holmesburg County Jail . The fresh salt air blowing across the Atlantic City boardwalk must have seemed refreshing to Frank and those of his friends who stayed behind to enjoy a few days of sun after the conference was over . Capone had been defeated . The war in Chicago could finally be brought to a halt . A national crime commission , with rules , had been formed . Crime was ready to go " legit.
