The sun has just dropped behind the Pocono Mountains , its afterglow silhouetting plain wooden bleachers rapidly filling with fans . The Palmerton , Pa. , high school band struts along the end zone , then turns smartly down the visiting team 's sideline toward a roped-off section behind their players ' bench . On the near side of the field , the band for Pleasant Valley High is already in place , alternating Sousa with the theme from Rocky , while cheerleaders flash blue and white pompoms . Five candidates for Pleasant Valley Homecoming Queen wait with feigned casualness in a special section , shyly grinning escorts at their sides . Just as it should be , the smell of burning leaves hangs in the cool air . <P> It is a perfect night for football . These are archrivals , the Palmerton Blue Bombers vs. the Pleasant Valley Bears , and they are contending before a homecoming crowd . At the kickoff the ball sails up , disappears in the darkness beyond the reach of the lights , then drops suddenly into view . A Palmerton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a swarm of blue jerseys . <P> The game 's opening quarter is a mishmash of mistakes . The two teams play Alphonse and Gaston with turnovers , swapping fumbles and interceptions four times . Finally , Palmerton settles down and scores . Pleasant Valley 's head coach , Tony Caracio , paces the sideline , trailing assistant coaches in his wake as he wigwags signals to his defensive unit . Pleasant Valley fans sit in miserable silence . At times the only sound is the popping of shoulder pads and the grunt of linemen . <P> But a tall , gray-haired man in rimless glasses standing by the Pleasant Valley bench smiles happily . He is Hugo Verbruggen , M.D. , Ph.D. , fellow of the American College of Surgeons and of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons , a distinguished doctor who acts as team physician to the Bears because his son once Clayed football with them . Dr. Verbruggen sees the game of football from a slightly different perspective . " It rained a few days ago , " he remarks . " The field has dried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still nice and soft . You do n't get as many injuries in these conditions . " <P> If Verbruggen is proved right , that will make the game unusual , if not here , at least in the U.S. in general . Injuries-the annual toll of broken bones , torn ligaments , concussion and , occasionally , paralysis or death-are football 's current shame . This fall , a million high school boys will be injured playing football . Most will suffer minor muscle pulls ; others will walk the rest of their lives on aching knees . A few will die . While Pleasant Valley and Palmerton are playing in Pennsylvania , a 16-year-old boy in Oklahoma dies of head injuries en route to the hospital during halftime . If anything , the damage is worse in college and pro ball . Before this season ends , 70,000 players from 900 colleges will be injured . And in the National Football League the official injury rate is 100%.
