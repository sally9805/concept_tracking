The importing and exporting of opera companies is perhaps the most unlikely growth industry in the world today . Just moving an opera company across town is a money-losing proposition ; to transport one across an ocean , lock , stock and spears , is to risk bankruptcy . Yet in 1975 the Metropolitan Opera flew to Japan , and both the Deutsche Oper Berlin and the Bolshoi Opera visited the U.S. And now , beginning this week , two of Europe 's most important opera companies will be mounting productions in the U.S. for the first time . Whatever the outcome of the new musical season , nothing is going to outshine the anticipation and excitement of such a gala double bill . <P> La Scala of Milan will start things off in Washington , D.C. 's Kennedy Center Opera House . Next evening the Paris Opera will open at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City . Putting its best forte forward , La Scala will offer-what else ? - three Italians named Rossini , Puccini and Verdi . Showing somewhat less of a nationalistic strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also offer Mozart the Austrian and , just to avoid outrage back home , France 's own Charles Gounod . <P> For many an opera buff the music is all well and good , but what really counts is the thrill of encountering a glamorous big-name conductor-such as Paris ' Sir Georg Solti ( who will conduct Le Nozze di Figaro and Otello ) or La Scala 's dashing Claudio Abbado ( Macbeth , La Cenerentola , Simon Boccanegra ) . Or being present when an important artist breaks through into international stardom-as , say , Paris ' dulcet-voiced soprano Margaret Price ( the Countess in Figaro , Desdemona in Otello ) may well do this time . Before La Scala and Paris wind up their two-week stands ( Paris will then follow La Scala into the Kennedy Center ) , it should be quite a show-both in front of the footlights and backstage . <P> Backstage is , of course , the real heart of any opera company , and its denizens are often as well known as the stars . There , be it in Washington or New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or intriguing position than Rolf Liebermann , 65 , the Swiss-born general director of the Paris Opera . In the space of only four years he has achieved what many thought impossible : he has turned the once floundering Paris Opera around and restored talk of la gloire . <P> Throughout its 300-year history , the Paris Opera has probably boasted more foibles than any other company-and , given the vicissitudes of the average opera company , that is saying a lot . Back in the 1770s , when it got ready to put on Gluck 's landmark opera Orfeo and Euridice , 18th century male-chauvinist Parisians balked at having a male contralto play the hero , considering that an affront to their manhood ; poor Gluck had to rewrite the part for tenor . In the 19th century , even a Wagner or a Verdi had to include a ballet in his opera or risk not getting it performed in Paris . In more recent times , the price of government subsidization included requirements that more than 50% of the repertory be French and that French singers be given priority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enfant Terrible Pierre Boulez was led to say that it was " full of dust and dung .
