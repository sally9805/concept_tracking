Rarely seen at public events without his derby or his pet cross-eyed mule , Sam Lewis has been the butt of jokes in San Angelo , Texas , for most of his 56 years . People laughed when someone put a live rattlesnake , with its mouth sewn shut , in his bedroll at a chili-cooking contest . They laughed even harder when he tried to peddle Hawaiian Delight pizzas , a terrifying concoction of Canadian bacon , pineapple chunks and cherries smothered in tomato paste and melted cheese . <P> But Lewis may strike it rich with his latest gourmet grotesquerie : lollipops flavored with jalapeo peppers . So far , he has sold 5 million of them , at a nickel a pop . Oilman J.W. Bowen of Odessa , Texas , gave away 4,000 of the suckers at a convention . " It was a gimmick that really worked , " says Bowen . Chevron Chemical Co. has ordered 1 million , with advertising slogans printed on the wrappers . Lewis already has plans to expand-into jalapeo ice cream this spring .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
