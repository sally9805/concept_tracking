This is the pre-Vietnam Daniel Ellsberg , as drawn by his father , Harry Ellsberg , in an interview with this newspaper ? the young man who was to change dramatically under the impact of his experiences in and with Vietnam , to the point where he now believes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " criminal conscience " about the war . Mr. Ellsberg , a soft-spoken , easygoing person , is a structural engineer in private practice at Huntington Woods , a suburb of Detroit . - - Role in papers skirted What emerges from his recollections about his son is a profile of an individualist racked by an agonizing sense of guilt over his participation in American policy on Vietnam  --  and who apparently felt his only recourse was to somehow alter that policy , no matter at what personal consequences to himself or his family . At no point in our discussion did Mr. Ellsberg concede that his son , who was last seen in Cambridge , Mass. , where he is a research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , did in fact pass the classified documents to the New York Times . Former Times reporter Sidney Zion has alleged that he did . Nor did Mr. Ellsberg indicate that his son has attempted to contact him during the past several weeks .

Daniel 's mother was killed in an auto accident in 1947 , and four years later Mr. Ellsberg remarried . In most respects , Daniel was a typical youth coming to maturity in the free-spirited , still isolationist Midwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II and the Korean conflict . He was active in his attendance at Sunday School , though he later drifted away from his religion . He had many friends , and plunged pell-mell into high-school extracurricular activities , participating , for example , on the high-school debate team as well as the basketball team . Daniel was always something of a fighter , Mr. Ellsberg recalls . " At 19 Daniel decided to climb Long 's Peak out in Colorado , " he said . " He learned alpine climbing from an alpine guide , who went with him Anything that 's tough he wants to do . " Daniel was 19 when Korea erupted in 1950 , but had no strong opinions about Americans fighting an Asian land war . // *Idealist racked by war guilt // Until about 1968 , when a shift in his views began to accelerate , he was a hawk .

" I 've been getting telephone calls at all hours of the night . I 've received many letters and most have been highly complimentary . I have even gotten a letter from a colonel in the Army out of West Point which was highly complimentary . "
