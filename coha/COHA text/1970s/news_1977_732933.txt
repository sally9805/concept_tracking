txt Letters pg . 38 Letters City Finance : Rohatyn Must Now Take Sides ' To the Editor : The present conflict between the banks and the city unions brings to light a most pressing ethical issue : Do banks invest ( lend ) for only economic reasons , or are credit decisions also based on the ethical impact these loans will have on the enhancement of society ? It seems quite evident from Jack Bigel 's Feb. 2 Op-Ed article that the answer to this crucial dilemma is the former . The men at Bankers Trust , Chase , Citicorp and Morgan have chosen to rely totally on credit principles , while not even consulting their social ' consciences . It is so ironic that their own " redlining " behavior ( in this case the city 's M.A.C . paper ) is undermining the confidence of all city and state debt instruments , which is so crucial in the marketing of these investment vehicles . Any astute investor is aware of the vital role confidence plays in both the equity and bond markets . Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city bonds for their own D'IZIS Bldermanas portfolios , why should smaller financial institutions , let alone the individual investor , bear the burden ? Felix G. Rohatyn , the M.A.C . chairman , should be commended on his fine efforts in restructuring the city 's debt load ; however , his notorious deal-making heroics fall short of the task at hand . He is not negotiating with the I.T.T . board , or the " boys " from Englehard Minerals and Chemicals Corpora- , tion . His present patient is an over , zealous , sick and inefficient city . The financial yardsticks used in corporate financing circles , such as debt/equity. price/earnings ratios , book value and . cash balances , can not be utilized for . the city 's behalf by the " Wizard of Lazard . " Rohatyn must now take sides with either his colleagues from Wall Street and Park Avenue , or the individuals represented by the city unions . If his feelings lie with the power of Wall Street , he should admit this and step down . What New York City needs now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we continue to analyze a human , social problem by such financial techniques as return on investment and pay-back period , we may be signing our name to a note called social decay and bondage. - JOEL H. KAMINSKY Brooklyn , Feb. 2 , 1977 To the Editor : In the letters columns of Jan. 27 , Alison Jensen ' cites New York City Environmental Protection . Administrator Robert A. Low 's admonition to turn off gas pilot lights to conserve fuel . As a long.time advocate of energy conservation , I applaud Ms. Jensen and Mr. Low 's purpose , : but turning off pilot lights during the winter season will not conserve energy ; in fact , it will waste a small amount . The rationale is as follows : During the colder part of - the year a slight amount of added heat is required in any dwelling in order to keep the inside temperature from dropping below . say , 50 ? F. at night or 65 ? F. during the daytime . The amount of added heat required is generally considerably more than the pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply their contribution , the difference must be made up by the central heating system . The To the Editor : I am interested in the suggestion of Caroline K. Simon ( letter Feb. 1 ) , the distinguished former Secretary of State of New York , that honorably retired Presidents of the United States be automatically made members of the Senate , with the privilege of the floor but without a vote : A somewhat similar situation putatively arose many years ago at a session of the American Association of University Professors . The members debated what to do with professors in good standing who became deans . They were on the verge of deciding that such members also be allowed to speak but not to vote . At this , John Dewey , one of the founders , arose to say that the decision would be . entirely wrong . Let them vote all they want , he said , but , for Heaven 's sake , do n't let them speak ! I propose , in response to Mrs. Simon 's suggestion , that ex-Presidents become full members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak and to vote . The possibility that they might break a tie or create one ' is remote , and in any case , why , as once ( with one exception ) duly elected representatives of the whole citizenry , should they not do so ? ROBERT BIERSTEDT Charlottesville , Va. , Feb. 2 , 1977 Jackets Required To the Editor : I was chagrined after dinner last night to receive the President . of the United States wearing a sweater in my house ( apartment ) , which is neither a hunting nor a fishing.Iodge . I had been under the impression that gentlemen , including my clothes-unconscious husband , wore jackets for dinner and civilized evenings . MARY HEMINGWAY New York , Feb. 3 , 1977 Of Coffee and Wages To the Editor : In the matter of coffee prices , it seems to me one question has been overlooked . How much of the price increase goes to.those who produce the coffee ? For us who believe that workers should receive adequate wages , it would not be hard ' to accept price increases if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are used to prices of autos and other goods being raised because workers are getting a bigger wage . Many believe that is a good idea . Improving the economies of the countries which produce coffee may in the end improve the standard of living of those who live in them . Since , in general , their standards are well below ours , we should be willing to help them improve theirs . There are good reasons for moderation in the use of coffee , medical and dietetic , for instance , but it is not clear that high price is one of them . CHARLES K. BROWN 3d Westtown , Pa. , Feb. 1 , 1977 To the Editor : My father , an American officer , died in France in World War I. I served in the U.S. Army in World War II , enthusiastically . I was called back and served in the U.S. Army in the Korean War , willingly . My son served in Vietnam as a U.S. marine  --  uselessly . I do not feel that President Carter 's pardon in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. Campbell states in his Jan. 28 letter . My son 's motives were honorable but gave me no pride , given the circumstances . There was no honor to be got from participating in this affair , and those who recognized it early are to be complimented . The pardon is fully in order . ANDRE WILLIAMS Bethesda , Md. , Jan. 28 , 1977 To the Editor : The Times 's news story ( Jan. 20 ) about the opposition of some upstate residents to the high-voltage power line that the New York State Power Authority is constructing from the Canadian border totally ignores the considerations that led four of the five members of the Public Service Commission conditionally to approve it . ( 1 ) The line will bring down to New York City consumers , who pay the highest electric rates in the country , cheap Quebec hydropower , at an estimated annual saving of $45 million . It will have the capacity to bring down much more ; Quebec 's untapped potential is enormous . The protesters already enjoy electric rates less than half those in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they get from that same Power Authority . ( 2 ) The desperate plight of the city economy , which the Canadian power would help relieve , is not irrelevant to the quality of its environment and the health and safety of its people . ( 3 ) The Canadian power already contracted for will displace the output of one major oil-fired generating plant ; so construction of the line will measurably improve air quality and , since the oil comes into the state in tankers , the quality of our ocean waters as well . ( 4 ) Our dissenting Commissioner Jerry has never flatly opposed construction of the line ; his objection was to our authorizing it before completion of our two-year hearings on its possible hazards  --  the most extensive ever held on the subject  --  after all the evidence on the worst possible effects was in. 1977 Priorities : Salt II And a Mideast Accord To the Editor : What surprised me most of all in Herman Kahn 's Jan. 7 Op-Ed era* , " Non-events of 1976 , " was his attempt to brighten up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by blaming it on some kind of a closed psychological cycle where pessimism gives rise to neurotic passivity and vice versa . I think that this is a flimsy effort on the part of the " think tank . " Bust perhaps Kahn thought that by goirig ' any deeper in his analysis he would be raising his hand ' a ... oinagainstthe funddl mental principles of his society . The assessment of both good aridbad events is , naturally , influenced by- ' the- ideological stand of the analyst . Nevertheless , out of ten of Kahn 's " good things that failed to happen " I fully share his views in two cases . First , about SALT II . It is in the ? interest of all living creatures on earth for this non-event of 1976 to become an event of 1977 , certainly before the fall . President Carter was very right when he saidin his optimistic Inaugural Address that success in achieving the ultimate goal of eliminating all nuclear ? weapons from this earth " can meanlife instead of death . " SALT II is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a settlement of the Middle East conflict would indeed be a splen -- did event of 1977 . I would like to mention here the growing importance ; under the present conditions , of cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States as co-chairmen of the Geneva Middle East Conference ' Given mutual desire , the two countries can do much to help the parties concerned in the search for an effective solution . VLADIMIR SurtoNov . Political News Analyst Novosti Press Agency ' Moscow , Jan. 27 , 1977 In Defense of . an Upstate Power Line in order not to lose the 1976 construction season . ( 5 ) His description of the benefits as only a non-recurring one-year fuel saving to the average Con Ed residential customer of $4.92 referred only to the advantage of avoiding that additional year 's delay . The savings will flow every year that the power flows , and could be five times the $4.92 if we succeed in using the line 's full capacity . ( 6 ) The article 's frightening reference to the dangers of induced shocks ignored the many pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a dangerous shock was simply not plausible . Mr. Jerry wanted the minimum clearance of the line above open fields to be 50 feet ; the towers we approved would provide 48 or 49 . Fifteen years of experience with high voltage lines of this kind , all of them closer to the ground , have not turned up a single instance of injury from induced shock . We are trying conscientiously to fulfill our heavy responsibilities to the people of the state . It was terribly disheartening to see those efforts , and the thorough explanations we provided , ignored . ALFRED E. KAHN Chairman , Public Service Commission Albany , Feb. 3 , 1977 The Times welcomes letters from readers . Letters for publication must ' include the writer 's name , address and telephone number . Because of the large volume of mail received , we regret that we are unable to acknowledge or to return unpublished letters . How Pilot Lights Save Energy pilot light as a heat source is more efficient than your central heating system since 100 percent of the heat from the pilot-light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent efficient . In the case of your boiler or furnace , about 25 percent of the heat goes up the tlue . Therefore it saves energy to leave the pilot , lights on any time the outside temperature drops below your interior household temperature . Ms. Jensen and Mr. Low are entirely correct if we are talking about the warmer months , and pilot lights do indeed become very energy wasteful during the summer . This is especially true in an air-conditioned house or apartment where the pilot lights are pouring unnecessary heat into the kitchen while an air-conditioner is simultaneously soaking up even more energy trying to cool the kitchen down .
