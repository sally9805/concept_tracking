The Nixon Administration 's epidemic of exits has apparently infected the nation 's chief health officer , Dr. Roger O. Egeberg , Assistant Secretary for Health and Scientific Affairs . Only 17 months ago Egeberg was widely viewed as a man who could heal the wounds left by the White House 's rejection of Dr. John Knowles , the controversial Bostonian who was originally slated to get the job . But last week all signs indicated that Egeberg will be ousted from his key post in the Health , Education and Welfare Department some time around the first of the year . <P> A tall , affable Democrat , Egeberg has been an Administration outsider from the start . In appearances before congressional committees , he has often damned Nixon health programs with less than faint praise . Six months ago , he publicly questioned whether the White House knew what was going on in the health field . <P> For their part , Administration insiders have questioned whether Egeberg knows what is going on in HEW . They complain that it took him eleven months to fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominees acceptable to the Administration . Critics charge that he has been too immersed in petty bickering with other HEW officials to do his own job . Egeberg claims to have the complete confidence of HEW Secretary Elliot Richardson . But Richardson has yet to make a public statement supporting Egeberg . <P> Two weeks ago , an aide to Vice President Agnew sounded out one possible successor , Dr. Neil Solomon , a 38-year-old Democrat who heads Maryland 's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene . Solomon not only turned down the job , but he went out of his way to praise Egeberg . " Dr. Egeberg , " he said , " is well qualified to lead the nation in this field if the Administration will only give him adequate support . " Others mentioned for the post are Dr. Vernon Wilson , director of HEW 's Health Services and Mental Health Administration , and Dr. Charles Edwards , head of the Food and Drug Administration . <P> More likely candidates are Dr. Leonard Cronkhite Jr. , director of the Children 's Hospital Medical Center in Boston , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HEW . Both men rank high on previously compiled lists of possible assistant secretaries . Equally important to an Administration that is visibly tired of internal dissension , both are Republicans .
