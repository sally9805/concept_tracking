A combination of rich oil deposits and relative political stability has long lured investment money and technology to Venezuela . Largely on the strength of this inflow of cash and know-how from the U.S. and elsewhere , the country 's living standard has risen to the highest level in South America . Lately , however , a tide of economic nationalism aimed at minimizing outside control of domestic resources has been on the flow in Latin America . Oil investment has been a frequent casualty . Argentina , Brazil , Chile , Mexico and Bolivia have put their oil-producing industries under state ownership . In Peru , the largest oil company has been expropriated . Last week a Colombian congressional committee recommended that the government nationalize foreign oil operations . <P> Until recently , Venezuela , the world 's largest oil exporter , remained immune to this nationalistic fever . Now it , too , is succumbing . Last week President Rafael Caldera signed into law a bill nationalizing natural gas . Foreign participation in ownership of banks in Venezuela has been restricted , and a new law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offing . But for U.S. investors the most worrisome measures are those that the government has directed toward its foreign-supervised oil concessions . <P> American firms , including Gulf , Mobil , Texaco and Atlantic Richfield , have an enormous stake in Venezuelan oil . Creole Petroleum Corp. , a subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey , lifts almost half of the 3.7 million bbl. of oil pumped daily . The U.S. companies have nearly $2 billion tied up in wells , pipelines and refineries ; it is the largest single American investment in South America . <P> Rusting Rigs . Thus the consternation of foreign oilmen at the government 's enactment of the Hydrocarbons Reversion Act just over a month ago is hardly surprising . The measure requires that when the present concessions expire , beginning in 1983 , improvements will revert to the state without compensation to the companies . Such a provision was written into the 40-year leases signed by the oil companies in the early 1940s , but the new law may force them to give up more than they expected to . By its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only concession land and all the equipment on it but also other facilities located outside the concession areas , including refineries , chemical plants , offices , bowling alleys and even the company president 's car . The companies contend that this is illegal and are taking their case to the Venezuelan courts . Says one Shell executive : " If we had been forewarned when the concessions were signed that this would happen , we would have invested accordingly . " <P> To ensure that the government will not be left with rusting rigs and dry holes when the concessions end , the new law contains another stipulation : over the next twelve years , the oil companies must put as much as $1 billion into a special government fund . If the equipment left behind is in satisfactory condition , the money will be returned to the firms ; if not , it will be used to replace and repair rundown facilities . The new legislation also gives the government greatly expanded supervision over day-to-day operations .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
