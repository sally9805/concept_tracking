Imagine the ancient stone heads on Easter Island having bodies . Suppose them transformed into papier-mch puppets eight to ten feet tall . Picture these puppets moving as if they were in some prehistoric slow-motion silent film . This is hierophantic theater , as old as time , as young as the infancy of man . To see The Grey Lady Cantata as performed by the Bread and Puppet Theater is rather like waiting in the mystic whispering groves of Delphi to hear the oracle speak . Despite the primordial trappings , this virtual dumb show is as contemporary as tomorrow 's bombing raid . It is a cantata of death , an immensely sad and strangely affecting tale of the wartime slaughter of innocents . <P> Glass Tear . The show begins amid the banal frivolity of a beer party . A group of the Grey Lady 's giddy friends have come in to guzzle Budweiser and Ballantine 's ale . These are not puppets , but men and women wearing decadent , citified masks . At the sound of a funeral chime , which is actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the side of the stage , the beer cans are whisked away . The guests leave and the stage is occupied by a puppet father and mother and a masked son . <P> The father looks much like Churchill and he smokes a white cigar , but the black wings on his shoulders signify that he is the Angel of Death . The mother , or Grey Lady , is the mater dolorosa , a woman of sorrowing countenance , possibly the mother of Christ ; her huge supplicating hands resemble those of a piet . She sends her son off to war and we feel that she knows he will be killed . A single glass tear slowly descends her right cheek . <P> Blare of Music . A white dove of peace chirps briefly , but flies off as a black widow spider of a model plane wings its way with a searching deliberateness across the rear-stage curtain . We see the bomber 's victims-to-be , other grey-lady puppets . They sway and huddle together in mute terror . We feel their pain all the more acutely because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Think of Picasso 's Guernica unfolding in slow motion and you have the image of these women dying . The evening ends with a jolly blare of music . The Black Angel and the Grey Lady wheel to the music-a Totentanz , the dance of death . <P> This may not be everyone 's idea of how to spend a little under an hour in the theater , but for anyone who wants to seek out and comprehend the deepest wellsprings of drama , it is an hour well spent . Within the past two weeks , Joseph Papp 's Public Theater , where The Grey Lady Cantata is housed , has offered playgoers : Subject to Fits ( a free-form fantasy based on Dostoevsky 's The Idiot ) , Slag ( claustrophobic feminine hysteria in a decaying British girls ' school ) and Here Are Ladies ( see below ) . The handsome landmark building on Lafayette Street in Lower Manhattan carries the exciting bee-hum of dramatic activity on every floor . Here is life , imagination , audacity and skill . <P> T.E.K.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
