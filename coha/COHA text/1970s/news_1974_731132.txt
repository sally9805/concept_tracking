txt MANY gasoline dealers in the Chicago area reacted angrily yesterday to federal energy chief William E. Simon 's call for a voluntary 10-gallon limit on each sale . However , some dealers already have begun to limit sales in an . effort to supply their regular customers and stretch their supplies , according to a ' spot survey . Many dealers , said they would not go along with a 10-gallon limit and they said such a limit could lead to station hopping by motorists . " HELL , no , " was the reply of Sid Wasser , owner of a station at 3200 N. Kimball Av. , when he was asked if he would limit sales . " Who are they kidding ? The gas companies have it , they are just hoarding it to drive up prices . " I know they hale it . I 'm not going to limit sales . " " It 's absurd , " said Steve Pearlman , owner of a station at 6000 N. Western Av . " It would just prolong the agony . " Pear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your clocks ahead an hour at 2 a. in . Sunday . the start of Daylight Saving Time . hours to stretch his supply . HOWEVER , DEALER . Bill Rodriguez , ' owner of a station at 5165 S. Archer Av. , said he already has ; imposed his own limit of $3 worth of gasoline to a customer because he was allotted 13,0011 gallons for all of January . " I could sell that in three days if I wanted to , but what would I do for the rest of the month ? " asked Rodriguez . Ile raised his prices Thursday to 49.5 a gallon for regular and 53.5 for premium when Mobil started charging him 21 : : cents more per gallon . " I do n't believe in it , " was the reaction of Robert Polinzzi , owner of a station at 1260 S. Skokie Blvd. , Lake Forest . " WHAT 'S TO STOP a customer from coming in here and then . going down the street , or coming back here again . IL just means the customer will have to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be bought . " Both Polinzzi and Rodriguez said they agreed with Simon 's statement that one of every five dealers is gouging . But both dealers said they have little first hand knowledge of the overpricing . Bill Farris , owner of a station at 171 York Rd. , Elmhurst , said he opposes the limit because it would force him to hire more help and drive up operating costs . " PEOPLE WOULD just go to other stations , " said Farris , who complained that he must send some of his eight employes homo when the station runs out of gasoline . The shortage already has led the manager of a Des Plaines station to limit sales to eight gallons . " I ca n't even give them each 10 gallons , Pm down to 8 each , " said Bob Nardini , manager of the station at 2655 Mannheim Rd . Dave Jacobs , who owns the station at 6251 N. California Av. , said : " If I can just hold onto my steady customers I think I 'll come out of this okay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve and keep his regular customers , gives them all they need , but he limits others to $2 worth .
