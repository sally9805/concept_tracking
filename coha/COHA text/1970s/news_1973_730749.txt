txt It was a foggy October morning along the North Vietnamese coast when Fred Purrington , a young pilot on his 25th combat mission , pointed his small , bomb-laden Navy jet at a string of barges below . Midway through his 450-knot tracking run , a burst of anti-aircraft fire found its mark and , with a " tremendous sinking feeling , " Fred ejected from the craft . He " knew it was going to be all over for some time . " That was 6% years ago , and since that day in 1966 , Lt. Comdr . Frederick R. Purrington has gone from " total despair " to a deep personal contentment based on a new-found faith and the realization that his experience has placed a considerable obligation on hitn . Two days after his 90-mile trek to Hanoi , Fred found himself in an 81-inch-saareThell ( furnished in " early Spanish Inquisition ? ) in the " Heartbreak Hotel " prison camp . While declining to elaborate on his torture , Fred By Barth Falkonbarg , staff photographer Comdr . Purrington " Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalls that through " pure , physical pain " he was reduced to being entirely alone , both physically and emotionally . A quarter-dollar-sized white scar on his right wrist hints at devices described by other returning POWs . In total despair ' " I had been broken and was in total despair . I felt I had let my family and everybody in the United States down , " he remembers . " I bowed my head and began to pray . . . then raised my head . ' You hypocrite , ' I said . ' Your entire life you did not give fun consideration to Him , and now you want some help . ' So I picked up my head and said , ' I 'll do it on my own ' . " Over the next three years , Lt. Comdr . Purrington 's experiences as a prisoner were much like those of other pilots ' accounts . From solitary confinement for the first six weeks to 52 men in a " cell-block complex like a drunk tank " designed for 36 men 18 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his developing sense of responsibility . Then , on Christmas Eve , 1969 , as he rested beneath his mosquito net during a time when " the pressure , relatively speaking , was not on , " something became clear to Fred Purrington . " I realized that I do believe in God . I realized that all those years I 'd been looking at ' I ' ? what am ' I ' going to do ? And when you 're looking inside , you 're looking at a very small speck on a very large beach . You do believe ' " So I started to think : ' Son of a gun , Fred , you do believe . Why not focus your attention at the pinnacle point . Instead of saying you want to serve your country or you want to serve your family , why not think in terms of wanting to serve God ? ' " Right there in that lousy cell in Hanoi , I found I could serve God . How ? I thought , ' I 've got other guys in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do what I have to ? tell stories , be a good listener ? to help them get through . ' Looking at that pinnacle point brought a great deal of contentment to me. " // *Focus on faith found in a POW cell // He used his college background in business management to teach his compatriots accounting and took them on long imaginary trips to the beaches and woods of Cape Cod and Buzzards Bay , near his North Dartmouth , Mass , home . " I kept pondering the question of what I was going to do with my life when I got out . I thought there might be the possibility that when I returned to the United States , maybe people would respect my opinion simply on the basis of who I am and what I 'd been through . " With this thought in mind , I realized there was very strong obligation on me to be sure that when I speak , I be honest within myself and honest with those people I 'm speaking to . " Time to ponder Fred pondered these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are constant demands on the returned prisoner 's time ? from inquisitive journalists and television talk-show personalities , invitations for " grand openings " and speaking engagements , and " Welcome Back Fred Purrington " hometown days . He obliges all he can , but reserved his first appearance last week for " a day I 've thought about for a long time . " At an assembly of the 2,600 students at New Bedford High School , Lt. Comdr . Purrington described to the hushed crowd " just how my thinking went " and the obligation he now feels . " I 'm not here to entertain you , " he told the enthusiastic audience of students , most of whom could n't remember a time when the Vietnam war had n't been a part of their lives . " If I were , I feel I 'd be prostituting the experience I had . " Later , he comforted an emotional girl who had worn his name on a POW bracelet . More than going home ' Hearing about this form of support by Americans , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " brought a lot of men who had their hearts wrapped in barbed wire to tears . " Later , taking a carload of friends on a tour of childhood haunts and hunting grounds around Buz7Ards Bay , he sought assurance that his message had gotten across . " The thing that really impresses me is the talent of the young people in America , " he said . " I believe very strongly that the future of this country rests with the youth of America . I 've heard so much about the kids today  --  drugs and everything . I want to influence them for right . I want to assure them that the principles this country was founded on are still valid . " For now , he will continue to oblige those who want to see him and touch his experience . But in June , he 'll " go back to being Fred Purrington , " buy the sailboat he 's always wanted , finally relax , and sort out the direction his life will now take . Both his parents passed on during his captivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after . Has Fred Purrington 's experience in North Vietnam changed him ? A former squadronmatA says , " It 's fantastic to see him now . " " He 's matured so much . . . really turned on to life , " says Bob Hinckley , now an airline pilot in Miami . " He 's reached total peace of mind with himself and God . It 's absolute proof to me there 's a fantastic world out there . " His lessons are applicable to everybody from a very real standpoint , " Mr. Hinckley continues . " The strength for something like this is in everyone ? this just proves it . "
