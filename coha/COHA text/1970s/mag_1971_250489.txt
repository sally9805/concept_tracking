The $125-a-plate testimonial dinner on Long Island last week began with an invocation by Father Louis Gigante , a Bronx priest who ran unsuccessfully for Congress last year : " Dear God , bless this food , bless this night , and God bless Joe Colombo and all the good deeds he has done . " <P> As the evening wore on , Joe 's deeds were extolled by the master of ceremonies , dais guests , and men and women seated at the nearly 100 tables scattered across the auditorium . A retired barber from Coney Island : " All Italians look up to him . He 's a wonderful father-he always tells his son Anthony to make sure his coat is buttoned whenever he goes outside . " Natale Marcone , president of the Italian-American Civil Rights League , which sponsored the black-tie affair : " Women in the neighborhood kiss his hand when he passes . He gives them his umbrella in the rain . Just the way he shakes your hand you know he 's a great man . " <P> Joe , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , league founder and , law enforcement officials insist , the head of one of New York 's Mafia families . His testimonial had been moved up two days because on the original date Colombo had been scheduled to begin serving a prison sentence for perjury . <P> <P> Thirteen hundred people were on hand to pay homage , as the engraved invitation explained , to Colombo 's " undying devotion to the Italian-American people and all humanitarian causes . " <P> Questions about his underworld life were dismissed by Westchester County Elementary Schoolteacher Dick Capazzola , one of the diners . Said Capazzola : " If Joe 's guilty of all they say , they ought to make him Secretary of State at least , because he 's too smart for them to prove anything . " <P> Curbing Slurs . When it was finally Colombo 's turn at the microphone , he observed : " The Attorney General hates our guts . I think the President is behind it . I want to make the league the greatest organization in the country , the greatest organization in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter what we do , where we are , even if we are in prison . " <P> It is with such appeals to ethnic pride , aided by legitimate grievances over discrimination against Italian-Americans , that Joseph Colombo has attracted supporters , opening chapters in New York , Las Vegas and Miami . Most joined the league for its efforts to curb ethnic slurs and stereotypes , and would be appalled at any use of it by the underworld . But the league , inadvertently or not , has benefited the Mafia-serving as a public relations smokescreen for mob activities . Colombo 's leadership of the league has made him the most outspoken reputed Mafia leader in the history of organized crime as well as a straight-faced anti-defamation champion to many New Yorkers of Italian extraction.
