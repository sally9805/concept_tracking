FELLINI 'S CASANOVA <P> Directed by FEDERICO FELLINI Screenplay by FEDERICO FELLINI and BERNARDINO ZAPPONI <P> What a brilliant subject for a Fellini movie-and what a disappointing treatment of it . Seducer , charlatan , scribbler , dabbler in black magic , Giacomo Casanova was that most magnetic of figures , the legend with nothing lofty about him . Born in a glittering Venice that was rife with disease and intrigue , he was equally at home in scenes of Watteau-like elegance or Hogarthian stench . He roamed the capitals of Europe , living by his wits , his nerve and a nice instinct for when to get out of town . He dreamed up mining schemes and lotteries , supported himself at the card table , survived imprisonment by the Inquisition , taught manners to princes and , almost constantly it seems , made love to women-servant girls , countesses , prostitutes-leaving a surprising number of them well disposed toward him . <P> Chilly Fop . " Having had all , " a friend said of him late in life , " he sees that he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all again vicariously , by writing his memoirs . This twelve-volume work made Casanova a classic instead of a footnote , for even in its most suspect and self-serving pages , the 18th century throbs with life and color . <P> Fellini has kept the color-indeed , heightened it-but drained away the life . He seems to have fastened on the legend only to repudiate it . Seen through his hostile lens , Casanova is a chilly fop whose salon manner is alternately tongue-tied and bombastic . How such a creature manages to charm so many women into the bedroom remains a mystery . Nor , once he gets them there , is it easy to see how they can derive much fun from the groaning calisthenics he puts them through . This is a film that earns its R rating not by making sin enticing but by making it repellent . In earlier Fellini works like 8 and Juliet of the Spirits , there was a fruitful tension between private fantasy and social reality . More recently , as in Fellini Satyricon , the fantasy has tended to overrun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich backdrop the historical period offered but drifts through the bizarre misty regions of Fellini 's own imagination . The episodes do not make up a narrative of Casanova 's life , but a sort of meditation on it . <P> It is a meditation peopled by Fellini 's patented galleries of grotesques - hunchbacks , dwarfs , crazed aristocrats , a giant strong woman in a circus and a particularly loony occultist ( Cicely Browne ) . But the presentation of most of these figures is so inert that they constitute a series of waxworks , tableaux morts . The film 's only burst of real energy , a tumultuous Venetian festival at the beginning , is quickly dissipated . Its loveliest image is completely gratuitous : the candle-laden chandeliers of a theater are lowered to the floor and extinguished by footmen wielding long fans . <P> In the title role , Donald Sutherland has the thankless task of trying to make something positive out of a negation . Heavy-lidded , stiff in his makeup and costume , he never shakes off the lugubriousness that has worked to better advantage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
