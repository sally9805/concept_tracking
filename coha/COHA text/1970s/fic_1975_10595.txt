" I 'm not bound for the Club , Mag . I 'm going to enjoy ora-tory . " She did n't believe him , and he could n't blame her . On a sudden , fool impulse he kissed her wrinkled forehead , then saw tears coming to the old eyes . " Goodbye , " he said . " Back soon . Goodbye . " He pushed the clog out with his foot and closed the door behind him . Outside , the air burned his nostrils and lungs . A cold fury , he thought , taking some credit for a fresh use of an old phrase . Unaidedby wind , it thrust its dead fingers into his clothes . The night was still , frozen motionless , its breath locked . His own puffs of breath bloomed white before him . He held up while the dog , barely able to lift a leg , took a leak . He went on , picking his steps in the churned and trodden snow and damning the muscles that had started to ache . Had he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there was no hope for a lift on these side streets and shortcuts . Hurrah for his choice , then . He was a little more than halfway to the school when he heard crying whimpers behind him . There was Bluster , down in the snow , scrambling and failing to get his legs under him . Cleveland walked back , saying , " You poor old son of a bitch . " He set the dog upright , positioning his legs and , watching , took a few steps away . The dog tried to follow but went down again . " Oh , Christ ! " Cleveland said on his return . " Mean I have to carry you when I can hardly carry myself ? " The dog 's sad eyes apologized . Cleveland cradled the dog in one arm . Fifteen more pounds , then , and almost half the way still to go . He stood still , willing the ache in his legs to ease up . Mind over matter , and how a man felt was determined by thought . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps to the entry at last , and Cleveland pansed and panted , wondering whether his legs would lift him the halfdozenrisers , let alone the first one . Frank Brobeck and his ugly face were about to go in . " Trouble , Mr. Mack ? " Brobeck asked  | " No . I made it , did n't I ? " " Sure , you did , Mr. Mack , but it looks like your clog did n't . Here , give him to me . " There could n't be a look of concern on Brobeck 's seamed face . He took the dog and moved aside to let people pass . Cleveland unbuttoned his overcoat . Christ , he was hot , cold out or not , hot and out of breath and ready to drop . He felt a tug on his arm . " Here you are , Mr. Mack , " Pinkie Adams was saying . " WesternUnion and yours truly on the job . " He heard himself wheeze , " Thanks , Pinkie , " and stuffed the telegram in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little , " Brobeck said , still with a sort of asking look in his face . " I feel kind of winded myself . " After a minute or two he added , " Ready now ? " Brobeck found a seat for him in the front row near the exit , set the dog to one side , folded Cleveland 's overcoat , placed overcoat and hat on the floor under the chair and reset the dog at his feet . " I could have done that myself , " Cleveland said . Brobeck moved away , saying , " Take it easy now . " After his breath and heart steadied , Cleveland looked around . He could see Mattie and Mrs. Anderson , Mr. Collingsworth and Mary Jess and , next to her , Ben Tate , who held sheets of copy paper and a yellow pencil in his lap . There were the Legion boys  --  Hank Stutemeyer , Alvor Torgerson , Jim Quinn , torchbearersfor true America . In the front row to his left sat Earl Kilmer and a spruced-up stranger who must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife beside him . If he had to , Cleveland thought , he could name everyone present . That was the way of small towns  --  no strangers . Opponents , even enemies , but no strangers . And it was the way of small towns to go to meetings , good and bad , exciting and dull , anything to relieve day-by-days . The hall , which would hold a hundred and more , was filling up . At the front of it rose a stage with a flag on it , but the arrangements committee apparently had decided on a lectern and desk , presumably to bring the truth nearer the people.  |p108After  the last of the audience had trickled in , Kilmer walked to the lectern . A smooth , unsmiling bird , Kilmer . Commitment and its air of sincerity left no room for humor in him and no door to argument . Kilmer welcomed the audience and went on , saying , " A good friend has suggested to me that our American Legion post do more , that , in a sense , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting on that good advice . " Cleveland felt himself squirming . Though he could hardly qualify as a good friend , lie was the one who had said that the Legion must make news if it wanted newspaper notice . " Yes , " Kilmer was saying , " we are doing something tonight , I am sure everyone will agree , something fitting and proper on the part of men who have fought for our country and who , by fighting , have manifested and increased their everlasting loyalty to the greatest nation on earth and to the principles on which it stands . " With that , he introduced the speaker , a man , he said , widely known and respected , a staunch upholder of the American way . And a lot of other damn things . It was his pleasure and privilege to present Major Mark McBride . McBride was smooth , too , smiling smooth , and the privilege was in reverse . It was his privilege to address so large and generousan audience . Flowered bullshit so far . McBride half-turned and pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was begot and what glory had attended its waving . The flag , the flags of all nations , Cleveland reflected , should have been listed along with the graven images men should not bow down before . What were they but pieces of bunting exalting to the farthest reaches of heaven good and bad both ? Respect for the flag was one thing , worship another . Bluster had let wind again . By rights he ought to share honors with the orator . On either side of Cleveland people put on a show of not sniffing . Like children in school they sneaked glances one at another , trying to detect who was guilty . McBride had come to the outrages perpetrated by enemiesp109against public order and national safety , to shootings and bombings , to Centralia , Seattle , Atlanta , Washington , and Wall Street . Radicals were at the heart of the trouble , radicals , socialists , syndicalists , all adding to bolshevists , all threatening the structure , the very spirit of what was America . The outrages were real enough , Cleveland thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Vanzetti and Sacco , which was still being argued . Of course McBride would n't mention excesses on the other side , since they were justified , patriotic manifestations . Neither would he mention labor , which had been convenientlyconsigned to the ranks of the radicals because some unions had rebelled against sure-enough grievances . " And now , " McBride was saying , " we come to the question of what the individual can do , how the honest and loyal citizen can work to save our society from the manifold perils besetting us . Oh , he is sly , that enemy of ours . He is devious . By subtle means he subverts our aims . A word here , a word there , outwardlyinnocent , a phrase , a paragraph inserted in otherwise innocuousprint , a belittling and polluting of the moral standards honored through ages , an avowal of righteousness where little exists  --  by such means does he undo us , for we are a gracious people , too quick in these dangerous times to ignore , forget and forgive . " Cleveland straightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing it in that professional manner that held and persuaded most of those who listened and looked . The considered modulations of tone , the practiced gestures , the projection of earnestnessagainst the threatening evil  --  these were his stock in trade , and they worked . The son of a bitch was good , that was all . Turning , Cleveland saw that Mr. Collingsworth 's dusky face had gone rigid . If he did n't watch out , that smart-ass at the lecternwould get a poke in the jaw . McBride seemed to be winding up as he spoke again . " Believe me , my friends , I speak without prejudice and without suspicion . I do not know what is taught in your schools . But do you ? That is the question . In this very school perhaps ? Have you examinedp110the textbooks ? They can be enemy instruments . Do you know what is in the library ? Main Street , for instance , that defamer of village life ? A library call be the nesting place of sedition , and of perdition , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nation ? The New Republic ? The Survey ? Harper 's ? The Scholastic , which parades as an educational organ ? " Oh , I tell you , good and loyal citizens , much that encourages the bolshevists and promotes their cause is to be found in these areas . If I had the power I would excise offending passages . Some publications I would order  --  forgive me  --  to hell . " The damn dog had offended again , but now no one noticed . They were caught up , these people , and held . Cleveland felt a slow fire in his guts . He wished he had whiskey to feed it . " I am powerless here , my friends , " McBride was continuing , " hut you are not . You can appoint screening committees . You can examine the textbooks , the library hooks , the publications , and through your board have offensive material deleted or banned and through the board , too , investigate those who are guilty or suspect . Our children , yours and mine , must not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Only propriety , only the decency to let the man finish , was holding Collingsworth back , Cleveland thought as he turned again . But it still would n't do . Collingsworth would n't do . He would n't explain . He would n't debate . He would march up and swing . Mort Ewing in rebuttal ? Nope . It was n't Mort 's dish . Whose then ? That damn fire in his belly tormented him . " So , " McBride said , now for sure in conclusion , " let us give our loyal thoughts , our faithful hearts , our dedicated efforts to the cause of America . God bless our country , and God bless us all . " Almost as one man the crowd rose and applauded . The fools . The damned idiots . Shot in the ass by evangelism . Only the hammer of a spike in the skull could restore them . Collingsworth was pushing to the front , his eyes aimed like a rifle . Cleveland wrenched to his feet , went to take a step and fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the clog one quick pat and lurched to the lectern.  | " O ye of little faith , " he tried to shout . His lungs were in his belly . Somebody snickered . Slowly people sat down . Collingsworthwas finding a vacant chair . " O ye of little faith in America . " He had found some voice now . A man  --  Alvor Torgerson it was  --  called , " Drunk again . " " Not drunk in the manner you are , " Cleveland said , pointing . " Not befuddled by the fumes of the phony . You , I suppose , judge yourself fit to decide what is fit to be read . " That ought to hold them . It seemed to . Torgerson had flunked out of high school . " Decipimur specie recti . ' That 's Latin , Mr. Torgerson , for We are deceived by what seems virtuous . ' In truth we are de-ceived . " Earl Kilmer interrupted . " Did you ever fight for your country ? Ever bear arms for America ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have the courtesy to hear me . " He looked out and around , seeing the faces blurred , more curious than intent , more eager for a ruckus than for rebuttal . " Will you listen , you people among whom I 've spent more years than some of you can count in your lifetimes ? Will you hear me , knowing I am not socialist , syndicalist , bolshevist or anythingbut American ? " He had found wind and voice now and his tones rumbled in his ears . " How long , how long , has man fought to be himself ? How long for the right to think his own thoughts and speak his own words ? We go back , back through the centuries to Stephen Langtonand King John and the eventual Magna Carta , the Great Charter , and before then to the mists of history , back and forth , following the brave efforts of brave men against the oppressive monarch , the priest , the tyrant under whatever guise , under whatevername . Among others , that name includes bolshevism . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he knew somethingof history , yet he had never been a public speaker and never tried to be , but it struck him as he gestured that he was getting some of the hang of it now , managing some imitation of McBride'sfinesse  --  the changing resonances , the pauses where use/ful , the right movements of head and arms . And it was all a cheap act , or it would have been but for the burn in him . " Long ago , in the year 1791 , our forefathers , drawing on the experiencesof men before them , drew up our own Bill of Rights . The First Amendment gave and gives us freedom of religion , of speech , and of the press , and the freedom to assemble in peace and to petition the government for a redress of grievances . Those freedoms , though sometimes denied us in hysterical times , have made America . Do you remember the words of one of the first of Americans and one of the greatest ? Thomas Jefferson said , I have sworn upon the altar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind of man . ' " He wished he had a drink , if only of water , but thoughts kept spouting . He pointed to McBride . " You , sir , do n't agree with Mr. Jefferson . You do n't believe in the rights of man . You would have us all think alike , alike ' meaning like you . You would control and channel our thought and our speech , even as Russia , though at the other end of the political pole , controls and channels its people . Given enough power , sir , men like you would put men like me before firing squads . " McBride jumped half up from his seat , crying , " Now you wait just a minute ! " and then slammed back in his chair , clapped there by the hands on his shoulders . The hands were Mort Ewing 's . Ewing told him , speaking loud , " You set there , mister ! We listened to you . " Cleveland nodded his thank-you . " We here have had our own guardians of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . You will remember the councils of defense and some of their idiotic excesses . In certain areas of the state indeed , nearly all  --  men were joined in suspicion , one of another . The acceptance of slander and hearsay and unfounded or silly charges of disloyalty and pro-Germanism usurped the place of calm reason . It was almost enough to have been born abroad , or to be closely descended from those born abroad , to be under the dark of suspicion . Even some of you here tonight , I know , though von probably do n't , were named as disloyal. "  |p113He  thought he could see an uneasiness in some of the faces , in those of first- and second-generation Americans . Ile took a breath and called on what strength he had . " Nothing came of all that in our county , except that one man and one only was persuaded to shut up and put up for Liberty bonds . Other reports were found to be false or malicious . Why , I ask you , why ? It was because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by accident appointed to our county council of defense two men of good judgment . Those men , as you know , were Mort Ewing and Professor Collingsworth , against one of whom you have heard slurs tonight . " There was n't much more to say , Cleveland thought , but there was more , and he would try to say it , though there were trembles in the hand and arm that supported him on the desk . The faces before him were blurring again . " Now , to go back . There are limits , necessary limits , to freedomof speech . You may not traduce a man with impunity . You may not bear false witness . You may not calumniate or malign . And it has been rightly and sensibly said that no man may cry fire in a crowded theater when there is no fire . " Of a sudden he was lost , lost for words , mind collapsed and body about to go , too . His mouth tasted pasty . He fumbled for his handkerchief , and his hand felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened it , willing his shaky hands to be still , hoping the crowd would indulge him while he made the pretense of having still more on his mind . Then he had it in plenty . " You , sir , " he said , pointing to McBride again , " have come close to traducement . Into this peaceful assemblage , into our loyal community , you have yelled fire when there is no fire . " It was Earl Kilmer who tried to get to his feet now , and again it was Mort Ewing , reaching over , who yanked him back . " A final point , " Cleveland went on , unsure that he could make it . " It has been asked if I ever fought for my country . Earl Kilmer has asked me , implying that one who never bore arms had no right to speak . I am not a professional patriot . I have almost never mentioned my record and never leaned on it as some do , but I rode with ' 1 eddy Roosevelt 's Rough Riders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Major , did you ever fight for your country ? " " I was in service throughout the war . " The answer came clearly but as if from some too-hold assumption of confidence . " An unresponsive reply , Major McBride . I asked if you ever fought for your country , and I will answer for you . " Cleveland brought the telegram to full view . " You never bore arms . During the war , throughout the war , you occupied a cushy place in the department of the judge advocate . Do you deny it ? " McBride did n't reply , except to mutter , " It was n't so cushy . " " By Mr. Kilmer 's standards , then , you have no right to speak , though I grant you the right . Yet I wonder what springs feed your polluted stream . Is one , and the only one , hatred ? Is one , and the only one , ignorance of the stuff of America ? Is one , and the only one , secret payments to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglect of the real ? Do I traduce you ? Sue me if so . " They were all swimming now , McBride , Kilmer , Ewing , Tate , Mary Jess , all of them , their faces flowing and changing place while the hall rocked . But one final utterance , one final blow , then rest after a drink . " You are a self-appointed censor , McBride . You are a bookburnerat heart . In you , deep in you , is the tyrant . We bid you goodbye , sir . We ask you to leave . " The lectern turned from him . The desk went away . A strange leg thrust out , numb to command . People seemed to be on their feet . They seemed to be clapping . They seemed to cheer . A hand grabbed his arm . He thought he said , " Thanks , Frank , " but it was n't Frank Brobeck . It was Ben Tate . Tate was getting him into his outdoor gear . Tate was saying , " Oh , you left your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tate was asking , " Got your car , Mr. Mack ? I 'll drive you home then . " The doorway was just behind them , and he thought he heard a hoarse voice sounding above other voices . It had to he Brobeck 's . " Now see here , folks , it was n't the Legion done this , not the whole  --  "  |p115So  he was home at last , and the place looked steady , looked fixed . The world had decided to settle down . At the door Ben said , " I 'm afraid your dog is on his last legs . " His eyes were n't on Bluster . " We 're all right , " Cleveland said . " Set him down . A long rest is what he needs . " " Ca n't walk , " Ben said , stooping . " I 'll take him in . " " Be quiet . Mag 's sleeping . " Cleveland went ahead , fumbling for light switches , trying not to totter . Ben put the dog down on the bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went to sleep or into a coma . It was a fine way to thank Ben  --  to wish he 'd get the hell out " " Sure . " " Then I 'll go . I 'll turn off the lights . " He put out his hand . There seemed to be a strange twist to the young mouth . " Mr. Mack , " he said and appeared to hunt for more words , " Mr. Mack , damn it all , thank you . " He left then . Cleveland got the fresh bottle out of the closet . The infernal thing did n't want to be opened . He drank from its mouth . After a minute , sitting on the bed , he felt a weak spread of strength . A big man , he was , a god-damned rousing success , declarer of independencefor one and all . Let heaven sing his praise . Anyhow , his hand had steadied , and he would do what he had to do . He eased himself up and went to his chiffonier and from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dog that lay with one eye half-open , unseeing , unhearing , closed to all dreams . He brushed the dog 's lips with the liquid . He said , " Goodbye , Bluster . Wo n't hurt , Doc Crabtree said . " The dog 's tongue came out and licked and licked again and then did n't lick . Cleveland returned the poison and went back to sit on the bed . He took another drink and sat , bottle in hand , and there was nothing in his head , not one thought , not one rernembrance to be regretted or savored . He ought to feel something , he told himself ,  |p116even  maybe a little pride , but all lie could do was sit and think he was thinking . He lifted the bottle again and drank and lowered it and felt it slip from his hand and knew he was falling.  |p119OUTSIDE  THE OFFICE , construction trucks rumbled , carrying explosives , cement , sand , lumber , machinery parts , gasoline . If he stepped outside , Ben knew , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose , from office to office and shop to shop . He would find carpenters and masons working and peoplesnatching time to look on . Not for the first time he said to himself , " Some difference . " President Roosevelt might be an opportunist , a hasty improviser , a grandstander , but he had put men to work . He pecked away at an editorial , aware of without being distracted by the sounds of activity in the shop , where both Okay Myers and his son worked steadily now as journeyman printers . Yes , due credit to Roosevelt , credit for his public concern , his optimism , his work programs , good or indifferent , and credit for the great dam being built on the Breast . Especially hereabouts for the dam , which the Advocate had argued for over the years , Mary Jess notwithstanding . Mary Jess was an antiquarian . The editorial completed , he typed " 30 " on the sheet of copy paper and said to her , " I think I 'll go sound him out anyhow . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years had n't changed her , unless a certain drawn refinement of features was change . They had n't changed her , and neither had wifehood . She remained beautiful and , somehow , untouched . She looked up and answered , " You know I think you 're being impulsive . " " Of course you do , but you know as well as anybody that we need a new building . "  | " It seems so right now . Will it later ? " He knew she was thinking of the lean times fresh in memory , of unpaid subscriptions , unpaid bills , scant advertising and dribbles of job work . It had been a struggle just to survive . " Later , after the dam is finished , there 'll be thousands of acres more of irrigated land . I keep telling you that . " " You keep telling me that . " " Damn it , Mary Jess , nothing ventured , nothing gained , as they say . " They also speak about having all your eggs in one basket . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up and stood at the window . There was no purpose in argument . He ought to know that much by now . She would be unchanged forever , firm in first opinion , touched seldom in bed , the virgin deflowered but still virginal . He said , " See you . " Dust hung in the street , and dust dirtied the store windows , but in this time of boom nobody cared . Strangers on the street , too , newly-come businessmen and men drawn to Arfive from eastern Montana , where drought , wind and low prices had forced some farm families to subsist on jack rabbit and gopher , plus what little garden stuff they might be able to grow , and to cut for their scrawny livestock the inedible Russian thistle that they called Hoover hay . Stricken though the immediate region had been , Ben thought as he walked along , Arfive and the county had known nothing that bad . No real dust storms , at their worst in the dust bowl but bad enough in eastern Montana , which blew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that , although the county agent was advising strip farming as an answer to the blown loss of soil . No men of his knowledge so poor that housewives canned rodents , provided there was ammunition to shoot them . Lines , but not long lines , for handouts . Drought , yes . Hardship , yes . Forced departures for the West Coast , yes , some . Yet the county had fared better than most . Peter Sears was putting a new front on his building and rcnod- eling inside , spurred to do so by competition from Penney 's . There was enough business for both . Billie Gayle was still eking along , thanks to soft drinks , tobacco and cards , and despite the brisk trade done by two so-called beer parlors . In his mind , as he made for the bank , ran the proofs of revival , most of them in sight on Main Street . A new hardware store , a new automobile dealership , two new gas stations , a new women 's store , three new restaurants , none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green was enlarging his drugstore , even though given more shelf space now that his whiskey business was ended . The state liquor store had taken over the trade . The old Club , Mort Ewing 's club , was a barbershop . Like its one rival , the bank building where he transacted his business had had its face scrubbed . ARFIVE STATE BANK shone on its front in bright metal . Stanton Rivers sat at his desk behind a waist-high partition , his attention alternating between the papers before him and the entrances and departures of depositors . He lifted a hand and said , " Afternoon , Ben . Come in . Have a seat . " Ben passed through the swinging gate and took a chair . Rivers asked about Mary Jess , commented on the weather , spoke about the dam and then asked , " Something special on your mind , Ben ? " He sat erect , just as he always stood erect . His dark face looked healthy . On it he grew a trim mustache that showed some gray . " Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . I 'm putting out feelers . You know I 'm outgrowing my place ? " " I would imagine . " " It was an old building when I bought it . What 's more , there 's no room in it for the small engraving plant I want to buy and no room at all for more editorial help . I 'll have to have more . I need it now . " " Yes , I see . " Rivers ' eyes were alert and friendly . " I thought , given encouragement , I 'd have some plans drawn . I already have my eye on a building site . But it all depends on financing . I ca n't handle it without help . " Rivers flattened his cared-for hands on the desk . His mustache/moved to a smile . " Ben , I would n't worry . Go ahead and have the plans drawn . You do n't have any figures , even tentative , of course ? " " No . It 's too early . " " When you have , come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally , but  --  " His hand dismissed the directors . Ben rose and shook hands with him , saying , " Thanks , Stan , " and went through the gate and out the door , feeling pleased . A good reputation was almost like money in the bank . On the street he nearly collided with Frank Brobeck , who said , " Watch out there , Ben , running high-headed and blind like a loco horse . " " Hi , Frank . How goes it ? " Brobeck wore frontier pants , a fitted western shirt , a big hat and cowboy boots and carried a revolver in a hip holster . He looked like the sheriff he had come to be . " Good enough , " Brobeck said and took him by the arm . " Got time to jaw a while ? " " Sure . " They walked to a worn street bench between two cottonwood trees , a good place to sit but for the dust and the hazard of birds overhead . " I 'm thinking , Ben , " Brobeck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come a long way , Ben reflected , since those first days of acquaintance . Road crewman , deputy sheriff , then sheriff , and , along with political progress , a growing confidence of manner , a reputation for reason and honesty , an improvement in speech . With the years , his big , furrowed face had become almost handsome . " First off and by the way , " Brobeck said , " how about going hunting this fall ? For elk , I mean ? We could get up a party . " Ben answered , " Well , maybe . We 'll see . " " You 'll be needing a vacation . So will I , and that 's the God 's truth . " He sighed . " Ben , you got no idea . " " That depends on the subject . " " The subject is these shanty towns roundabout  --  three ofp123'em  --  and the men and women the dam has brought in . Christ ! " Traffic flowed on the street , and foot traffic sounded behind them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . " " But you really do n't . Oh , let ' em have their beer and their outlaw booze and their young floozies and their old slum whores . Gambling , too . Who cares ? " " You seem to . " " And what it all brings on . That 's what I care about . Fights every night , bad fights , and they have to be busted up . Then no one will bring a charge or appear as a witness . And that road to and from Burtville , it 's death alley . You do know that . In Burtville , in all three towns , we try to restore order , but , hell , how you going to restore it when it was n't there in the first place ? My staff works its ass off , and what 's to show for it ? No cases , that 's what . " Brobeck sighed again and put a hand to his cheek . " And the kids in those shacks , the poor , goddamn kids . Some run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks . Quite a few get sick , and no one to nurse them . And , Ben , some go to whoring right after being toilet-trained . " " The paper speaks its mind , week after week . " " Sure . I got no reason at all to criticize you . It 's just that there 's nothing to be done , and I get tired of it . " " You 're not thinking of resigning , Frank ? You could n't be . " " It 's not in my mind , but I could resign and live for a while on my sudden wealth . Sure , I got quite a pile for the old homesteadthat the dam will flood . But I 'm hanging on , hell or high water . " " Good for you . Good for all of us . " Now Brobeck smiled his crinkled smile . " That 's really what I wanted to talk to you about . Close to it . " Abruptly the face sobered . " Ben , I would n't want to go against you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world are you talking about ? " " The state senate . Or the house . Higher office . I hear people say you would be a good man , and there 's no doubt about that . " There was a question in the big face.  | " That 's nonsense , nonsense because I wo n't run , " Ben said . " I 'm the outsider looking in and always will be . " Did Mary Jess remember those words ? " You 're sure ? " " Positive . " Ben grinned . " You know , the paper might even support you . " Brobeck thrust out a sudden hand . " Ben , " he said , " thanks . I just might need you . " They got up and walked on , and Ben crossed the street to the office . " I think I 'll run out to the construction site , " he said to Mary Jess , who had switched to her typewriter . " Want to come with me ? " " No thanks . I 'm swamped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and was sorry immediately . A good share of the personality of the paper , a good share of credit for its survival , was hers . He stepped over and kissed the brow that she lifted . " Do n't hurry . You might eat out tonight , Ben . I 'm going to get a scratch supper for Father , then hurry off to that meeting to-night . " " You work too hard . " " As if you had n't been working every night of the week . Besides , I enjoy it . " And so she did , he thought . Enjoyed work too much . Enjoyedit at the cost of what might and should be . " All right , " he said . He went to the car and wheeled off . The day , at least , was fine . The afternoon sun smiled on the work of man . The breeze held its breath , and so the dust hung like a long banner on the road to the dam . It was like a big , torpid snake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust , along the meanders of the Breast River , he could see the winding growths of willow and cottonwood . They stood still , satisfied in the sun 's rays . Had Mary Jess been Mattie Murchison , she would be at his side . If he were to suggest they turn off to the woods and make love , she would smile and be willing . But Mattie was marriedp125now , to a second cousin of her first husband , and had a son , both events announced in jocular little notes . Was n't it convenient , she had asked , that she had n't had to change her name ? But it had been a long time since he 'd heard from her , a long time since those Tuesday nights . A jack rabbit lay mashed in the road . A couple of magpies flew up from it . Farther along lay a dead porcupine , then a skunk . The odor of skunk filled the Buick . The dam site was a confusion of machinery and men , of noise and dust , of moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side and watched , regretful of his ignorance about construction . But he had a right to feel that the dam was his , some part of its being was his , a little , mixed with the shares due the PWA and the President . The unacknowledged editor still was entitled to some satisfaction in self . A road of sorts led around the construction site and on into the canyon . He started his car , tooled it along the road and after a mile or so stopped at a small mountain park where the walled mountains widened and the river ran free , as if never to be stopped in its course . Here was no dust , and the noises from downstream came muted , sounding under the river 's soft murmur . A patch of broad-leafed fireweed shone like a spangle on the near shore . He left the car and sat close to the bank and saw a trout jump in a pool where the stream turned . The sun , declining , touched one shoulder and the side of his face . A voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver ? Hey , do n't jump through your collar . " " Oh , hi , Jap . Did n't hear you . Lots of room to sit down . " Jasper York sat , saying , " You city fellers got no ears . " He was a man of perhaps fifty-five , his skin darkened by sun , his eyes squinted by it . When he was n't trapping or guiding anglers and hunters , he bached it in town , where he was known for an occasionalthirst and an oblique way of expressing opinions . " How are you , Jap ? " " The happy loafer on horseback , that 's me . Horse is grazin '  |p126over  yonder . But how am I for a fact ? " The rumble of blasting came from downstream , and Ben could feel a quiver of earth . " I 'm thinkin ' the Bible played hell when it said the earth was made for man . That 's how I am . " York got out a pipe , crumbled tobacco in his palm and lit up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played with a leaf . " Make the most of it while you can , " York said . His eyes rose to the mountain side and lifted to the clear sky . " This here , " York went on , waving his pipe stem . " This grass , them trees , them posies along the bank , brutes , big and little , the mountains theirselves . " His head moved in a slow shake . " That Jesus Christ dam ! " " You have to think of men . " " Men . Yeah , men . I had a pet once , a cub bear , just the one , and I cared a heap for him . But bears by the bushel , bear after bear in hear country , why , I guide dudes to shoot ' em and do n't cry a tear . If only one dandelion grew , you 'd have to add to the grandstand . " " But men have to eat . You do yourself . " " I can make out without riskin ' my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million of ' em was done for last year in Montana . Did n't say how many men owed their room and board to that fight . And now for relief , so men can eat , as you say , we got a general program for rodent control . Goodbye , all ground squirrelsand bunnies and such . Eat hearty , men . " Ben grinned , as he imagined York wanted him to . " But , Jap , " he said , " you ca n't stand in the way of things . In your own lifetimeyou 've seen a lot of changes . " " Ca n't call to mind any good ones right now . " York fell silent , then added , " Hell , I know I 'm a lost coyote , the last coyote cryin ' to the last moon . Jap York . Jap York . ' Do n't that sound like a bark ? " York faced toward him , and Ben saw sadness in his eyes , the sadness of goodbye said by him or the world . " Sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knocked the ashes from his pipe on the heel of his hand and put the pipe in hisp127pocket . " You do n't feel it like me and you do n't agree , but that 's all right , Ben . " He walked away , as silently as he had come . In the west the sun had vanished beyond a cloud bank , leaving only the fire of its going by the time Ben returned to his car . To detour by way of Burtville , which Brobeck 's talk had suggested , meant only an extra five miles , and Mary Jess would n't be waiting him . Some distance before he came to the squatting of shacks , he saw and picked up the girl.  |p128AT  FIRST , in the fading light , he thought she was a boy , an undersizedboy who dragged one lame foot in the roadside dust and appeared as lonely as the last of the race . But when she raised a hesitantthumb , he saw she was a girl dressed in a blouse and jeans . He braked the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " As she approached , he leaned over and opened the door , seeing a young , lonely face with the look of haunt in it . She pulled herself inside and pushed back her long hair . Her brow was good . She said , " Thanks , Mister . " " You 've hurt yourself ? " " I sprained my dumb ankle . That 's why I thumbed you . " He let the motor idle , not shifting into gear . " You 'd better see a doctor , do n't you think ? " " It 'll heal by itself . I got no money for doctors . " Her voice was soft and matter-of-fact . As if to answer the question he had n't posed , she added , " It 's my old man 's fault . We had a big row and I went for a walk to cool off . " " Your father ? " " Who else ? He 's the only old man I got , not that he 's someone to brag on . Two years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another man . I ca n't blame her one bit . " A car went by , and someone , probably a drunk , called out , and the call settled and died along with the raised dust . " You 're ready to go home now , I suppose . " " Got to , havin ' lamed myself up . The old man 's likely gotp129some liquor in him by this time , enough so 's he can serve beer without sloshin ' it all out . " He studied her , feeling pity . She could n't be more than fifteen or sixteen or , at most , a small seventeen . Without embarrassment she let him look , like a child innocently open to scrutiny . " You live in Burtville , then ? " " Upstairs over Smitty 's beer parlor , my old man and I , if you can call it livin ' . The old man , he tends bar and swamps out when he 's sober enough . " " I see . And you 're the cook ? " " Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live on pretzels and crackers and maybe a piece of smoked sausage or cheese or pickled stuff that the old man sneaks from the bar . He ai n't got much appetite . " And so it was all accounted for , the lean features , the slim boyishness , even the look of haunt . She asked , " Want to feel my ribs ? " " No . " He waited until two more cars passed and then switched the car lights on , dimming them . " What 's your name ? " " Beulah . It 's supposed to be Beulah Sanders , only I ai n't sure if my old man 's my old man or not . When he 's mad , he says damn if I 'm any blood kin of his , for a true Sanders has got more to him than me . Mostly he 's mad when he 's drinkin ' . " " And most of the time he drinks ? " " That 's where ever ' cent goes , on booze . Lookit here . " She showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wash it all the time , it bein ' one of just two , which is all I got to my name . " Cars were wheeling in from the darn site now , more and more of them , their lights striking through the Buick and going on . He rolled his window tight against the dust . He should drive on , he knew , but her matter-of-fact , childish candor held him , and she must have still more to tell . Something had to be done for her . " So you and your father quarreled ? " " I already said so . " " Care to tell me what about ? " " You ask a lot of questions , mister , but I do n't mind . It wasn'tp130about booze we had our fight . He 's so damn moral , if that 's what you call it . Goody-goody , I call it . Wants me in my cage starvin ' , just so 's I got a rag to cover myself . " " So ? " " I was goin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . " " Good Lord ! Big Lil 's ! " ' To men she was known as Big Tit Lil , madam of the main whorehouse in Burtville . " If she 'll take me , that 's where I 'm goin ' once my ankle 's all right . " " You know what she does ? What her girls do ? " " Sure . Even if I ai n't practiced , I can learn . I can be broke in . Anything 's better than nothin ' . That 's what I told the old man , and he got on his high horse , sayin ' no Sanders ever went chip-pie . " " You could look for work  --  other work . " " What ? Washin ' dishes for my meals and a poor penny extra ? Mister , some of those girls at Big Lil 's make twenty-five dollars a night , maybe more . Besides , there 's no dish-washin ' jobs around that I know of . " How tell this girl ? How explain to this child ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blowsiness and bloat ? To her the future was twenty-five dollars a night and a square meal . He asked her , " How old are you ? " " Old enough . You can see . " With one quick movement she bared a breast . In the dim light it looked as round and as plump and as fresh as a peach just picked . He kept his hands on the steering wheel and said , " Cover up ! " " I was just provin ' it to you . " " Cover up ! " " Sure , mister . I did n't mean to be dumb , but dumber girls than me work at Big Lil 's , I bet . " " I 'm sure of that . But , look ! Before you tackle Big Lil for a place , let me scout around . There 's sure to be other work for you . There 's bound to be something better . " " Anything 's better than the shape I 'm in now . Hungry and ragged and broke . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm going to give you some money right here . " " I was n't hintin ' at that . " " I know you were n't . I 'm going to give it to you provided you do n't try for Big Lil 's . " " For how long ? " " Just until we see . " " Well ? " He took out his wallet . It had two bills in it , a ten and a five . He held them out to her . " Mister , " she said , not taking them , " I ai n't on charity , but I got only one thing to give . You just have to say yes or no . " She turned her face to him , the young , lean , sober face which now held the look of pleading as if she hoped to be spared but still would consent . This for that , tit for tat , it for fifteen dollars if he insisted . He thrust the bills in her hand , put the car in gear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burtville she pointed . " There 's where I live . At Smitty 's . Over the beer joint . " He pulled to the side and stopped . There were customers and lights in the beer joint . A man with whiskers and alcoholic ruin in his face stood behind the bar and tried to squint through the window . " He 's lookin ' for me , but he ca n't see nothin ' , " Beulah said . " My old man . Pretty , ai n't he , mister ? " " Remember your promise , " he told her . As if in grateful goodbye she flung her young body against his and kissed him . Of themselves his hands and arms tightened on her , and he abruptly pushed her away . She said , " That was my thanks , mister . " " All right . Go now . " She let herself out and limped for a step or two , the bills upheld and forgotten in her hand , and watched him as he drove away . Big Lil 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eye . Beulah would have been in demand at Big Lil's.  |p132He  ate a late and solitary supper and , eating , happened to think of that new woman appointed to the federal emergency relief office . Her name ? Herlihy , was n't it ? Patricia Herlihy . She would be a good one to see about Beulah . The house was dark when he entered , but Mr. Collingsworth called from his bedroom , " That you , Ben ? " " Yes , governor . Good night . " He undressed in the bathroom . Mary Jess would be asleep  --  or pretending to be.  |p133MR  . COLLINGSWORTH placed his knife and fork on his plate , used his napkin , sighed with satisfaction and said , " A good meal , Mary Jess , dear . " It was , Ben thought , an often-expressed judgment and a true one , though only the Lord knew how she found time for cooking . To his " Amen " Mary Jess answered , " Thank you both . " " I 've hardly had time to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Collingsworth said . Mary Jess asked , " Any special news ? " " No . You can read it , of course . Between the lines it appears he continues to do splendidly , especially in English and music . " " Not homesick ? " " Never once , apparently . You would have thought he would return home for vacation rather than take summer courses . Astonishing , is n't it , that this country seems to have no hold on him at all ? " " He hears Thoreau 's different drummer , " Ben put in . " I suppose , but I feel sure I could n't live in New York , not for a king 's ransom , though I 'd like to be able to say I was a graduate of Columbia . " He paused and went on , an edge of regret in his voice , " The different drummer . Two boys reared in the same place , in much the same manner , but young Mort seems to be pleased with our state college . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on as Mr. Collingsworth liked it to after dinner . Talk and more talk . Discussions about matters both big and small . Chit-chat . Personal reports . Questions about the pronunciationsand meanings of words . References to the dictionaryp134kept ready to hand on a stand at the side of the room . It was quite a well-furnished room , it and the whole house for that matter . For Montana , the furniture , some of it , was elegant . By any standardsthe best pieces were very good , though shaded by the presence of the old upright piano Charles used to practice on . Mary Jess had been the principal collector . Through him she had developed an interest in antiques that exceeded his own , and in off hours during those dead clays before work began on the dam had scoured the country , going to auctions and junk shops , storage sheds and battered homes . Once in a while she had picked up for pittances the good pieces that owners , hard put for cash , had thrust aside even in better times . A Hepplewhite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . A Chippendale chest . An inlaid , mahogany , half-moon table . Some of the better Victorian stuff . Probably it was all made by ancient American craftsmen , not imported , but it was all good , fine in line , shape and substance , and it was all old . She rejoiced in finding and having each piece . All right , Ben thought . Better to have one passion than none at all . And he had enjoyed the refinishing , taken pleasure in working with the old , whispering cherry and walnut and mahogany . Mr. Collingsworth had gone silent . A frown creased his forehead , and lines deepened at the sides of his mouth . No doubt he was thinking about some vexation the day had brought , and , like as not , he would speak next with blind heat , in hard , leveled tones , addressing his dissatisfaction to a found substitute . You never could tell . He was that way . They were awkward , even disturbing , these sudden and fugitive rages , but they were best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collingsworth 's general worth , his stout intentions , by the sun that followed the heat lightning . And if keeping still made the listener feel somewhat like second fiddler , what of it ? Besides , Mary Jess would n't want her father disputed . Ben pushed back from the table , saying , " I have to go out for a while . " " Not work again ? " Mary Jess asked . " Call it an errand of mercy , " he said and got to his feet . She would n't care to hear about Big Tit Lil and a poor girl whop135thought she could learn how to earn twenty-five dollars a night . " Be home early . " He walked to the rack , put on his hat and went out to their goodbyes . The late summer night welcomed him . It breathed the assuranceof well done and all right , though the day had seen little done . Overhead the stars waited the rise of the full moon . To the west he could see the vague line of the Rockies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the two-story apartment building , once given over to a cheap store and cheap offices , where Patricia Herlihyhad suggested he come , thus avoiding her constant workaday interruptions . He climbed to the second floor and knocked at her door . She opened it at once . She said , " You 're punctual , Mr. Tate . Do come in . " She was a small , erect girl , on the edge of plump , who could have been twenty-six years old . A neat package , Frank Brobeck had called her . She had substituted a flowered housecoat for the suits Ben had seen her wear . " Take that chair , " she said after he had acknowledged her greeting and entered . " It 's reasonably comfortable . " The room was small but tasteful enough . Its size seemed to suit her , as did the tidy furnishings . Yes , a small neatness all round . Her face , he figured , was Irish  --  bright blue eyes , very fair complexion , nose small and a little upturned , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belligerence . " Would n't you like a beer to start things off ? " she asked . " It 's really not necessary , and I promise not to take much of your time . " " Would n't you ? " " Well , yes , thanks . " She disappeared and came back with two tall glasses and after serving him sat down , unaware or heedless that the housecoat spread open from above her knee to her ankle . The exposed leg was good , he saw , before her glance drove his eyes away . She lit a cigarette . " You said the business was personal . " A smile went with the words . Her teeth were good , too . After drinking , she went on ,  | " Rather short acquaintance for personal things . " She smiled again . " Tell me . " " Personal , " he said , feeling a little on guard , " but hardly as the words might suggest . " " Yes , " she answered and listened , her eyes on him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beulah Sanders , how he had happened to meet her , what she had said , how she had impressed him , and why he had come here . Miss Herlihy , not interrupting , had finished her drink by the time he was done . " We ca n't let that happen to her , can we ? " she said . Her smile struck him as somewhat at odds with the sentiment . " I hope not . " " Apparently this girl made quite an impression on you ? " " She was so young . " " How old ? " " Surely not more than seventeen . She would n't tell me her age . She just said she was old enough . " " Of course she is . Our sex gets that way early . Out of mothers ' arms into men 's . " She made a small face . " Who wrote The Way of All Flesh ? The title at least is wonderful . " " I do n't know , but  --  " " Yes , Mr. Tate . Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , as if by sudden infusion . " But would you think ill of me , sir , if I suggested we had an honest drink first ? My grandfatheralways said beer was a beverage for brats . " " No objection , but I did n't come here to drink up your inven-tory . " " Inventory , one bottle , " she answered and took their glasses and went to the kitchen . She returned briskly after a minute , handed him a glass and sat down . " Now to business . " He took a swallow , watching her do the same , and , when he could , asked , " Did you add any water at all ? " " Some . Enough for me . If it 's too strong , the tap 's in the kitchen . "  | " No . It 's all right after the first shock . " " Drink , then . " She followed her own order , taking a gulp that he found hard to equal . Mort Ewing would have said the drink was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books  --  " she began . " Who 's speaking of books ? " " I was , just a minute ago . How are you coming along ? " " With what ? " " Your book . Every newspaperman has a book in him , though he seldom gives birth . Right ? " The whiskey felt good in his stomach . He took another swallow . " Once I was going to , " he said . " And never have ? " " Never a decent line . Hardly any lines at all . " " Why ? " It was none of her business . " In the ten years I 've been here , it 's been a struggle . Only lately have things begun to look up . " " But still you wo n't write your book ? " She tilted her glass . " Excuse me if I say you 're an inquisitive miss . But all right . In the beginning I thought I 'd write about the war , as soon , that is , as I could bear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men wrote about it , better by far than I ever could do . So now ? " Sure enough , he thought to himself , once he had thought he might write a book or perhaps a series of books . There would be time for them later , after he had established himself , for time spread forever ahead . But the years passed , closing doors . They took with them some part of energy , some part of ambition , some part of hope , even some part of regret at things left undone . That was the final loss , the slipping away of regret . But these were oldmanthoughts . Hell , he was only thirty-eight . She had allowed him time for reflection , which he ended by saying , " What 's wrong with a good newspaper ? " " Nothing , but are n't there stories everywhere , even in way stationslike Arfive ? Men live and work and dream and love and sufferand die . "  | " Agreed , but do n't knock our town . It 's home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's how ! Home to the sailor . " She was a greedy drinker . He had to keep gulping to keep up . The whiskey had brought a light flush to her cheeks . If possible , it made her eyes brighter . Without too much effort a man could think of a blossom waiting for pollination . She said , lifting her glass , " I like to drink , if that 's news for your paper . You can also report that I 'm up and at ' em every morning and keep up the pace through the day . Do n't you enjoy wetting your nose ? " " Yes , but it 's hardly compatible with circumstance . " It was as if she were studying him and the words , seeking conclusions , and he felt himself shy away from the possibility that she might press him for explanation . In the presence of a woman like this one , what man cared to admit that he largely abstained because of his wife and her father ? A man liked to appear to be his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time , that in some ways he was not . He felt the good strength of the whiskey in his blood stream . " Under the circumstances , " she said , " let 's have another . Come on . Mix your own poison . " He followed her to the small kitchen . She got out an ice tray and put cubes in their glasses . In this close space his nose opened to her perfume . It caught the faint , good , woman smell of her . " Say when , " she said , pouring from a bottle labeled Bottoms Up . Back in the living room she said , " I 'm garrulous . That 's because I seldom have company . But do n't think I 've forgotten the purpose of your visit . To save a poor girl from a life of shame . " " And the miseries that go with it . " " Frankly , " she said with a sudden businesslike air , " I hardly see how our office can be of help . " " Why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be sure , but they 're not directed so much to individuals as to groups and masses . Our object is to give work to men , to restore pride through self-sufficiency . "  |p139The  inappropriate smile touched her face . " Your girl apparentlywill have no trouble finding work , work of her choice . For the self-supporting we have no program . " " It 's not work she would choose , if you can call it work . It 's not work anyone would choose for her . " " Oh , yes , men would choose it for her . Without men she would n't have work . But , even so , as it is she has food and shel-ter . " " Of a sort . " " Better than a lot of people . But , as I said , we try to provide work for men out of work , and for impoverished boys , too , as in the Civilian Conservation Corps . I 'm afraid not much attention has been paid to women , though we have one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the masters . " " But surely  --  " " Oh , I 'll see this girl of yours , since you asked me to . I 'll try to do something . " She took a sip from her glass . " But , tell me , Mr. Tate , just what is so wrong with prostitution ? " " You ca n't be serious . " " Ca n't I ? " " She 's just a kid . " " And my office is not a vice squad , thank God . Your kid is big enough , as she told you . She can make herself self-supporting , and that 's the whole aim of the programs  --  self-support . " " No matter how . That 's what you 're telling me ? " " I 'm telling you this . Through the trickle-down process  --  no pun  --  when men have work , prostitutes can be self-supporting . They do n't need us . But you avoid the main question . What reallyis so wrong with prostitution ? " The imp in her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You know as well as I do . " " I know that every woman has regarded prostitution with some measure of fascination . If she has n't , I bet she 'd be a poor wife . Now I 'll mix the drinks , since you seem a little upset . " When she returned , he asked , " You 've been married ? " " Briefly . The bottle was my man 's single devotion , but I wouldp140have made a pretty fair wife . But have you ever thought about what I just said ? " " If I have , it 's just now . " She drank , thoughtfully rather than thirstily . Then she turned the smile on again . " This may shock you , Mr. Tate , but if I had one piece of advice to give a young girl it would be this : Beware of the man who seeks to protect your virtue . What he means is , save it for me . " " That 's not true in my case . " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Perhaps you may come to doubt yourself . " " You 're really spoiling for an argument . " " Really , I 'm not . " She drank again , and he , too , lifted his glass . " I 'm saying  --  I do n't mean to offend your delicate sensibilities  --  if your little girl wants to be a whore , she 'll be one , and I 'm asking what 's wrong with that ? " " But you will see her ? " " I said I would , and I will . " " And try to do something for her ? " " Something you think should be done for her . I yield to your noble principles . " She finished her drink . " End of argument . End of interview . " At the door she took his arm . " I 'm really quite moral , " she said . " I do n't believe in charging for what is my pleasure , too . " She gave him a sudden , full-mouthed kiss and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A teaser , he thought as he went to his car . He found himself striding . A mere teaser , or more than that ? He undressed quietly and got into bed and reached out for Mary Jess . Drowsily , without heat , in her soft-singing voice she said , " You stink of whiskey , " and moved away from him . How did it happen , where was the why of it , that Mr. Collingsworthshould have sired and reared a daughter both sterile and frigid and a son whose masculinity just might be open to doubt ? Patricia Herlihy was really quite moral.  |p141BED  WAS A GOOD PLACE to be  --  or could be . He lay in it , alongsideMary Jess , and let a side thought go to Beulah Sanders . Surely , after two days , Pat Herlihy would have found time to see her .

And into their company came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had found relief in each other ? How long since those Tuesday nights when they had made love without loving involvement ? Body to body , with BeulahSanders , with Pat Herlihy , with Mattie Murchison . Any of them . It was faithless to dwell on them , to feel himself swelling with memory and impossible prospect . He moved closer to Mary Jess and put his arm over her and pressed himself against her seat . There was always the chance , the slim chance . She said , her voice as always somehow seductive , " Please , Ben , not tonight . I 'm tired out . Wo n't you move back ? " " Lord , Lord , " he answered and , when she did n't reply , asked , " Why not , Mary Jess ? Why are you always too tired ? " " Please do n't exaggerate . " " All right . Nearly always too tired ? Or something ? " " It 's you , Ben , if you 'd only admit it . I 'm a perfectly normal woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the push of his body were of no use , asking as he moved , " Who is the judge of that ? "  |p142Mattie  had said in that long ago that women were liars , one to another , unwilling to admit normal appetites to those of the same sex . And was n't his own experience , though limited , enough to prove Mary Jess wrong ? He said , " So all marriages are frustrating to men ? " She turned face to face to hiui then , her knees drawn up like barriers . " I suppose you can speak for all men ? " The lovely voice had the strain of anger in it . " Just as you can speak for all women . " Ten years , he thought , ten years since their marriage , and he had believed then that the nagging , the aching urgencies would be quieted , that love would be answered with acts of love , that all would be well  --  husband 's needs satisfied , wife happy to satisfy them . Out of bed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it only a dream that reality shattered . Only a damn dream dreamed in ignorant youth . She said , " Look at yourself . " The omission of " Ben " in her words was significant . " Understand yourself . " " Sure . I 'm a sex fiend . " " At any rate you 're insatiable . " " Am I ? Two times a month if I 'm lucky . You ration it out like limited calories . " " I wo n't argue with you . I said I was tired . " " It 's a sort of tyranny , the way you use sex . Give the boy one cookie if you must and afterwards expect him to be a good boy to the point of death by starvation . " " I wo n't listen to any more . " " Do n't , then , for Christ 's sake .

Just sleep in other beds if you must , but be discreet . As ap143couple we have a reputation to maintain . " The last words sounded wry . " I do n't want to lie in other beds . " He was close enough to the truth to justify what he said . " I give you your freedom . I just do n't care . Only be discreet . " " That 's exactly what I might do , " he replied and felt lost , lost to the lost dream , lost to the bonds he respected , lost to all save the free future and a new , slow anger . To save them she had to give so very little of self . She had only to yield , only to goddamn yield . So little to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying shortly , " Good night . " He lay awake wanting her , wanting her to the total exclusion of any others , he told himself . It was so little to give , he thought , so great to get and so hard to come by . And now it served her right if she had to cry . Were all men like Ben , she asked herself ? The answer was probably . It might be that most of them actually were . Men . Barnyard roosters , happy only in a harem of hens . Nature 's way for the race to perpetuate itself , as if child after human child mattered . She had no wish to perpetuate herself . God knew her mother and father had done enough of that . Pregnancy on pregnancy until Mother died of pregnancies ; and the end result , the token reward was a bundle of red wrinkles that grew up to be Charles . Thank heavens Brother Charles showed no outward interest in sex . She was probably sterile and should be glad . Accused , Ben had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing had happened except the long dread of pregnancy . She did n't , she would n't , mess with precautions herself . Those ugly preparations were up to Ben , and he had promised not to forget or ignore them . Sterility , and it was just as well , an added insurance , though , more than ever , it made the act of sex empty . The act of love , it was known as , as if love could n't exist without the coarse seal of performance . The coarse seal , nearly always unwelcome , never invited . Mostp144women must think and feel as she did , and , if they did n't , neverthelesshere she was , incapable of keeping Ben satisfied , incapable really of ever finding joy and release in the act . She would n't cry , she told herself ! The hand on which her head rested closed into a fist . She would n't cry . The problem was Ben 's , and he could n't help himself , either . Why cry ? Once or twice Ben had tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed hard on her body ; and the tricks had been bestial , rude as any animal 's preliminary behavior . Father had had it better than Ben , Ben had said with thoughtlessor thoughtful cruelty , touching on circumstances best never thought about . She had ceased trying to understand the physical woman who had been her mother . And no longer did she feel any grievance toward Father . Maybe it was because in his long , wifeless years he had never shown an interest in another woman . Not once had he . Pictures of Mother , six of them , stood arrayed in his bedroom , and , sometimes , entering , she had caught him studying them with what seemed to be and must be devotion . And sometimes , unknown to him , she had heard him singing , " No rose in all the world until you came . " The one woman in his life , the abused , cherished woman , loved beyond all . It was unlikely men like Ben ever could understand . But Ben was such a good man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his animal appetite . Industry . Patience . Thoughtfulness . Intelligence . Gentleness . He was kind to Father . He overlooked , he dismissed Father 's senseless bursts of temper . He did n't argue . He did n't disagree , and he did n't concede . He just kept silent , even when Father needed rebuke . She should be glad he restrained himself , even if it made him seem , well , rather pale , even if she wished he 'd talk back as she had learned not to do . Only a time or two had Ben suggested , mildly suggested , that they buy or build their own house and vacate the old premises . He had understood , then , that she could n't leave Father , could n't possibly leave him . For his sake , they could n't . Forget Ben 's . Forget hers . Think of Father . He would n't be happy without them . He would n't be happy anywhere else . Here was home.  |p145A  patient man , Ben . A cheerful man . A successful one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more outspoken and heated opinion . And she had given this good man her permission for illicit rutting . Now pray that no other woman came into his life . Pray for constancy . Pray against anything that would mar or ruin their marriage . She could see him lying with some willing partner . She could hear them whispering confidences . And a sudden fury came on her and turned into hurt . Such a good man , and if he asked her now , she would come to him . If only he put his arm around her and told her he loved her . But , freed , he lay still , far away from her , a great divide between them , the divide she had erected , hard and impassable . Move to me , Ben ! Ask and it shall be given you . It was then that she could n't keep from crying.  |p146THEY  DROVE to the office together , as wordless , it seemed to Ben , as two strangers passing on opposite sides of the street . There came a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wall between talkers that more talk could n't climb . Concession could do it , but who would concede ? Not Mary Jess , that was sure . And not he , that was just as sure . It gave a man a certain , a rightfulsatisfaction to reach a position from which he would n't budge . Only when they were in the office did he say , " Do n't count on me today . Sportsmen 's Club meeting at noon , Lions Club meetingtonight . " " Very well . You can have the car . Father will pick me up . " " No need to . One of the boys will drive me home . " " Very well . " He looked in the shop and found the men busy , without need of directions , and gathered some copy paper and overdue bills and went out . Dust was a price of progress . It rose and hung and settled down on the town only to rise again , whipped up by trucks and pickups and passenger cars . Just a year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except now and then for the passage of a vehicle whose owner had a piece of rare business and the price of a gallon of gas . Hurrah for progress , then , but it was time the town paved its streets . It could afford to . There was a subject for an overdue editorial . And the old cottonwoods , dusted over now , that shaded Main Street . Some of them were dying , and more had been cut down . The damn birds , you know , and , what 's more , a business/man wants his sign to be seen , not lost in a bunch of branches , the guilty parties had argued , ignoring the fact that the trees gave the town a pleasing individuality that most high-plains settlements lacked . There was another editorial , one for Mary Jess , if and when . He dropped into Billie Gayle 's place for a package of cigarettes , and Billie said gently , while an ungentle fate agitated his hands , " Morning , Ben . Fatimas again ? " " Fine morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a fine morning , " the tortured mouth said . " To wake up to any morning is fine . To know you 're still here . " " You sound pretty doleful . " " Oh , no . It 's just I would n't want to come to the end of my days and not have good things to look back on . Like mornings . " There , for Billie , was the sum of it all , Ben thought , all that he asked for , all perhaps that he wanted , plus , of course , enough money to supply his few needs . Any mornings fine and all morningsgood to remember . Let the world wake to light , struggle from bed , fumble into clothes with hands and feet that would n't take orders , and rejoice for the dawn . " Sure , Billie , " Ben said , touched by a sense of shame , " I 'm with you . " He took his change from the trembling , uncomplaininghand and walked back to the street . He went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and all danger was past , or almost , after a combined loss for which the ranger would supply figures tomorrow . He learned at the offices of the Corps of Engineers that work on the dam was abreast of schedule or even ahead of it . Penney 's spoke for a full-page ad , Peter Sears wanted a half one , and Spence Green one of two columns . The new man at the new lumberyard paid up , with apologies . Patricia Herlihy was walking up the street as he came out of the lumberyard office . She wore a businesslike suit , a little severe for place and weather , but above the close neck of it her face seemed to bloom . He said , " Good morning , Miss Herlihy. "  | " Since when , Ben ? " " Since when what ? " " Since when Miss Herlihy ? " " All right , Patricia or Pat . Still , good morning . " " A busy one , " she said . " Busy clays , all of them . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To talk about now , yes , but I have n't forgotten . " " Or done anything ? " She frowned and said , " Just a little . I 'm afraid it needs discus-sion . " " All right . When ? " " I 'll have some office news for you , too . " " That 's good . When again ? " The frown turned into her impudent smile . " Would it compromisethe editor to come to see me tonight ? I 'll be home . " At his hesitation she added , " For the sake of appearances you could bring your briefcase . " It came on him to say , " And a bottle ? " " Why not ? " She clicked off in her high heels , her face smiling as she looked over her shoulder . So Pat Herlihy had n't exercised herself to help Beulah Sanders . It was doubtful she would . The roguish and provocative face faded into that of a lean , little girl with disappointment in it , the sad eyes fixed on Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not there . By all that was holy , not there . And it struck him that what she would sell was the very thing that his groin demanded , though not from her . No , not from her . Put that base thought aside . Bury it . But so things went  --  good intentions , untoward and sneaky impulses , and no answers that satisfied both . No answers . That was the answer to life . No answers . Yet he could go to the post office , scribble a hopeful note to Beulah and enclose a few dollars and thus weigh in for rectitude . The note written , in care of Smitty 's , and fifteen dollars enclosed , he felt better . He would feel still better if Frank Brobeck canvassed the courthouse on the chance there was a job for her there.  |p149Skeeter  Jerome , so named because he resembled a gnat , sat in the outer office , telephone to his ear , and with a thumb motioned Ben back . Brobeck was at his desk , papers before him and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and said , " Hi , Horace Gree-ley . " " Howdy , high sheriff . " " Glad to see you , Ben , but I got nothin ' much for your news nose today . Have a seat . " " Fine morning . " " Yeah , but by the looks of you you did n't come to talk about weather . Something on your mind , Ben ? Something weighty ? " " Something you might help with . " " Yours truly . Spill it . " Ben looked toward the connecting door and saw that he 'd closed it and then told about Beulah Sanders . " I wondered , " he said in conclusion , " if maybe you could scout up a job for her here ? " Brobeck had listened , his cigar held still in his teeth , his ugly , not-ugly face grooved as always . Then he said , " What 's the lady 's name ? " " Did I forget that ? " " Shit , Ben . What is it ? You protectin ' her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Brobeck took the cigar from his mouth , shook his head , bowed it in his hands and shook it some more . " Jesus loves me , " he said . " Why say that ? " " Beulah Sanders ! " " You know her ? " " Innocence is a trap , Ben , and maybe a sin . " " You 're speaking of her ? " " No , for God 's sake ! You . " Brobeck shook his head again . A smile that might have been rueful touched his mouth . " Bawlin ' Beulah . Little bawlin ' Beulah . She hooked you . Been hookin ' the innocent right along . You 're a sucker , Ben . " " Thanks . "  | " You 're welcome . But back to the case . That poor , little , innocentgirl that tore your heart so , she 's been whorin ' at Big Tit Lil 's for more'n a year . Now , when trade gets slow , she hoofs off up the road and plays sorrowful . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't spread the word , because that would jinx a legitimate business . " Ben looked away . He heard a sigh go out of him that was more like an exhaustion of lungs . " Now , " Brobeck went on , " them as do n't know , like you , pick her up and get sympathetic , hero ' she 's so alone in the world and so close to sin . Way it winds up , most of ' em fuck her in the interests of purity , give her a nice piece of money and tell her now to be a good girl  --  until they come by again , that is . " Brobeck 's eyes peered from their fretwork of wrinkles . " No , I guess you did n't , Ben . " " I did n't . " " I believe you . But you gave her money . Even sent her a note today . Signed , too , I bet . " Ben nodded . " Want your money back , and the note to boot ? " " Forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the holy temple was wrecked . It 's just your innocence suffers . " " I 'm a sucker . " " But a good sucker , Ben . Do n't forget it . " " Why do n't you shut down all the houses ? " " Now , now , Ben . Do n't get riled . There 's arguments both ways . No one 's payin ' me to let ' em stay open . Best of a bad choice is what I say . " Skeeter Jerome stuck his head in the door . " Sheriff , you made a note to remind you of that Sportsmen 's Club feed . " " Thanks , Skeeter. 1 ' 11 be there . " After Jerome had closed the door , Ben said , " I know you 're not being paid . " " Well , the hell with the whole subject then . You remember when I talked about huntin ' ? "  | " Some time ago . " " It 's all set up now . Jap York will outfit and guide us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opens . Spence Green wants to go , and there 's you and me , and then our friend , Mr. Earl Kilmer . How does that strike you ? " " All right . " " You do n't even hear me . " " I said all right . It 's your party . " " Aw , let the son of a bitch come along . Ca n't hurt , even if we both got our eyes on the Senate . " " I 'm not sure I 'll go . I do n't care about killing . " " Who says you have to shoot anythin ' . Just tail along . " " Maybe . " " Make it yes . Ben , I can see things are gnawin ' on you . Your face has forgot how to smile . You have to get away , by God , and look at the sky and feel the breeze and fill your belly with camp food and get a taste of freedom from all shitty fret . " " Lecture ended ? " " Nigh onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm smart enough to see that , and it 's not just Beulah Sanders and your bleedin ' innocence , but I ai n't curious . What I want is the old Ben . " He looked at his watch . " Time we went to that lunch . " Walking to the Arfive House , Ben felt demeaned and betrayed and , more than that , foolish . A smart man , he was , a knowledgeableeditor , a contributor to rectitude where no rectitude was . A silly son of a bitch , full of innocence , brimming with sperm , thinking of Mary Jess , thinking of Pat Herlihy , a man with no answersand no right to opinions . But he could act . Tonight he would skip the Lions Club , buy a bottle and , briefcase in hand , call on Pat Herlihy . She might think him witless but conclude he had other credentials . He slid into bed , trying not to disturb Mary Jess . But she moved closer to him and murmured , " Ben , " and did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was willing to make herp152belated concession . His mind could hear Pat Herlihy saying , " Skip the preliminaries , Ben . I 'm a self-starter . " And later in the night she was saying , with emphasis on the last word , " Good God , Ben , do n't you ever get any ? " He patted Mary Jess 's shoulder and moved away . And now it was he who could say , and say truly , with a pleasure that pained him , " I 'm too tired tonight , dear . "  |p153MR  . COLLINGSWORTH placed a red queen on a black king and let the deck rest in his hand . He had never liked card games , in fact had avoided them , but someone  --  who was it now ?  --  had taught him Klondike , which he said was one version of solitaire , and it was a way to pass quiet hours . In one picture at the back of the flat desk on which he played , May was smiling on him . Her mouth was gently amused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Benton ? " The other pictures , standing on dresser and shelf where he could see them from his bed , showed gentleness , too , but not so much of amusement . " Burning daylight , Maysie , " he said to himself . " That 's what Jack London would call it . " He ought to be making preparations for the beginning of school . There were still things to be done , but a full staff had been engaged , had arrived and been interviewed , and he had no stomachfor detail today . Better to sit quiet and fool away time with the cards . The summer days were always quiet , what with no school to attendand Ben and Mary Jess out of the house . In older times he would have had a fishing rod in his hand and his eyes on a trout hole , but fishing was , after all , only fishing , and good roads and automobiles and more anglers made decent catches infrequent . Another picture was chiding him , saying , " Now , Benton , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He answered in silence , " But , Maysie , I 'm older . Things are n't what they were . No , not with me and not with the country . It used to be good fishing was only a short hike away . Used to be . "  |p154He  slid a card from the deck , saw there was no play and again held the deck idle . Change , he thought . Years . Time . There was never a now to seize and hold still . It slipped past the tongue and became then in the moment of saying . A man trying to grasp it felt it slide through his hands and hook him and carry him into new nows that were n't nows because now never was . The world was a world of thens , of back-whens , of used-to-bes . Time swept on , hurrying a man along with it , and the only beacons he sighted were those long left behind . The long afternoon sunlight shone through the west window . It , too , would be gone , was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it would be a new night , different from all nights before . And the unsettled weather of the equinox would return , not as it ever had been . There was no play for the red four or the black . Pity for them to be buried when the prospect was good . " Sorry thinking , " he said without words and went on thinking . The smiling face on the desk understood . Time was the great thief , the slow , sure taker of all . Of the school board that had hired him in those green years of long ago only Mort Ewing survived . The others  --  old Mr. Sterling McLaine , Jay Ross , Mere Marsh  --  one by one they had been subtracted from days remembered . Friends , the old , certain friends beside whom later ones paled ? The Stuart Alexanders were gone , and their great house to the west of town stood blind and vacant , its lower floor the retreat of horses and cattle in bad weather and fly time . Old Mr. Greenwood had been taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world that he believed Jesus Christ preached . Smoky Moreau , the mystic Indian , drawn off to the happy hunting grounds . And Macalester Cleveland , the neglected , whose removal time had celebrated with a blaze of pure light . A man could even regret the loss of his enemies . Almost alone of old friends , besides Ewing , Doctor Crabtree remained , weathered as a piece of discarded harness . He gathered the deck and shuffled , saying but not saying , " Just one more , Maysie. "  |p155There  had been laughter in those days , laughter and hearty talk and feasts to founder a man . It was then as if everything were at the beginning and ahead lay the ripe world . Thirty-four years , he thought while he surveyed the new layout of cards . Thirty-four years of trying to teach simple manners and excite intellectual curiosity in incurious rowdies , in gum-chewers and bubblegum-blowers and glandular showoffs . Was the cultural level elevated as a result of his labors ? How many , given the start , pursued knowledge ? Maybe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the second . They were the great and scanty reward . He made a play . The downing sun shone longer in the room . " The years that the locust hath eaten , ' " he said , not aloud , to a photograph on the shelf . He rose and stepped to the west window , the unturned cards in his hand , and looked to the mountains . The base of Elephant Ear Butte , which ignorant upstarts were calling Ear Mountain these days , lay shadowed by its own height under the sinking sun , but the summit was crowned with light . How often had he looked at it , finding some kind of assurance there , knowing that at least one thing endured ? Let people , seeing him , wonder at this attraction to stone . He would n't explain , if he could . It was there , and he was here , close by , a partner to what the locusts could n't devour . So , he thought , sitting down again with the cards , I laze away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon and eveningstar and night . A placid , tranquil life , easing along to the end . There was a slow vexation . Tranquillity . A tranquil house , a tranquil daughter , a tranquil son-in-law . Even were Charles back from Columbia , he would only add to the unrelieved atmosphere . There were no storms in this house and no aftermaths of sweet calm . Lives cruised along at dead level . Once he had had a temper and had exercised it , to both his regret and gratification . He was still edgy and always would be , but his temper , so easily fired in past years , had given way to a controlled irritation . Call him tranquil , too . He turned the ace of spades and put it up . This dead house needed children , no matter how pesky . Itp156needed shouts and thumps and tears and laughter . Children to love and enjoy , to share living with , to direct and shape and forge and be proud of . " Where are the babies , Maysie ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben ? Are careers so important ? Is your love not love , then ? " Maysie , " he said silently while his gaze went from picture to picture , " We knew , did n't we ? We had a better life , did n't we ? Tell me it 's so . If only you had n't had to go on ! " Now , aloud , he said , " I loved you so , Maysie . " For an instant , in the lowering beam of the sun , Doctor Crabtreeappeared , stern as God , and May lay dead in their bed . DoctorCrabtree was asking , " How many pregnancies , Mr. Collingsworth ? How many live births ? How many miscarriages ? " Then the stern mouth , suddenly torn , said , " I wore out one wife myself . " Mr. Collingsworth seized a handful of cards and flung back his hand to throw into the shaft of sun . Then he placed them quietly on his desk , got up and marched out.  | " LITTLE FROSTY these mornings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ben answered . " Yeah , but not for elk hunting . No snow , no tracks . " They rode in Brobeck 's pickup , which was loaded with huntingtripgear . The first light was just striking the high tips of the mountains , and Brobeck switched off the car lights and switched them back on , for the morning 's mist hovered low . Snow showed on the peaks and in the high crevices twenty miles to the west , but lower down the Rockies were dark , for this little time holding their secrets against the eye of the sun . No wind stirred , and the dust of the day before had settled , not to be disturbed again until workers started out for the darn . " I bet those damn two , Kilmer and Green , will hang back until the horses are packed , " Brobeck said . His face showed good humor , though the dawn light shadowed its furrows . " Do n't matter , though . Jap York and I can get the string ready . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure . " Brobeck turned to smile . " But you 're just along for the ride . Which reminds me , just why did you bring that light rifle ? No open season on deer this year . " " I told you it was the only one in the house . Some rancher , gone broke , gave it to Mr. Collingsworth for clerking an auction . " " Which do n't exactly answer my question , since you do n't intend to shoot anything . " " That 's for the others to find out , but everyone will have a gun , everyone on this trip . "  |p158Brobeck  smiled again . " Did n't want to be plumb out of style , huh ? " " Something like that . " " Like goin ' to a birthday party with nothin ' in hand ? Like bein ' found bare-assed at a fancy-dress ball ? " " All right , Frank . " In the distance , at the dam site , the great earth movers stood outlined . One light gleamed from a crane . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humps and gashes of constructionloomed dark , like giant animals stricken , Ben thought , like creatures , gouged , that lived before man . Looking , Brobeck said , " Say , Ben , you heart and soul , so to speak , for the dam ? Hundred percent , I mean ? " " You ought to know . I 've been plugging it long enough . " " Yeah , for irrigation to begin with . But this ai n't for irrigation . Just flood control , and it do n't hold up to argument . " " Irrigation will follow , do n't you worry . Meantime men have work . " " Oh , sure , and I 'm all for that , and you know it . It 's a poor dish , empty bellies are . But still the darn means sayin ' so long , so long to the runs and holes we used to fish , so long to huntin ' grounds and campin ' grounds and pretty places we knew once . " " But if every change is goodbye to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . At least we can believe so . You 've got me preaching now , but we ca n't say no to the future . If the first men in the West had said no , there 'd be no Montana , no Arfive . " " Which , I guess , would n't have bothered them much . Remember , I 'm with you , but you run a newspaper and so got to be up in the collar . " Brobeck was right enough . A good newspaper stood against stagnancy . It had to concern itself with community welfare , to look ahead , to encourage , to promote . To back President Roosevelt , if it came to that . To support the authorities and administrationshe had brought into being , makeshift and disorganized and in need of refinement as they might be . The man aimed at the general good.  |p159Into  his thought Brobeck said , as a by-the-way , " The Indians tried to say no . " " And could n't . Neither can we , and we should n't want to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future is what we make of it and can be better than anything yet , but we ca n't make anything of it by balking at change . " " You 're preaching , sure enough . All right , no balk . " And yet , Ben thought , and yet . It was a sorry condition of life that change always had to tow a trailer of goodbye , that every gain entailed a loss . It was sorrier yet that every choice , big or little , had to be burdened with regret . Or with a load of guilt . Take himself , he thought as the pickup bumped along . Only with Mattie Murchison had he felt free of guilt , but there had been a choice there , a choice of marriage no matter what she said , and he had made the choice and come to know a lingering regret . Which might be why he seldom made a point of calling on her mother . Last time he saw her , months ago , she told him Mattie had a good job but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herlihy . Freed by Mary Jess , he had lain with Pat by choice , not once but often , and as a consequencehad become an undemanding husband , and Mary Jess was happy with him , perhaps suspecting but not knowing why the change . There was a gain of sorts . But gain or not and freedom or not , the choice had burdened him with guilt , as recollection of it did this minute . To sneak up back stairways ! To feign business meetings ! To arrange secret pickups at dark corners and take furtivedrives ! Great conduct for a married man with respect for the proprieties . It was some small comfort to have learned that guilt piled on guilt made the first inconsequential and the last less onerous . He hitched in his seat . He could n't make that choice again or feel that latest guilt again , for Pat was leaving town , appointed to a better station at Butte . Good ! Good ? Brobeck steered around the southward footing of the dam and remembered to turn off his head lamps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fury of the day  --  roar and clatter of machinery , voices , dust , blasts in resisting stone , gouged and turn/bling earth  --  would begin soon . Now the monsters of machineryslept , and the only noise was the noise of the pickup , the only dust the dust stirred by its wheels , the only voices his and Frank 's when they chose to speak . Brobeck said , " Kind of spooky , is n't it ? Like ghosts , those machinesare , but nights are the time for ghosts . These start rattlin ' their chains with the sun . " Above the dam site , away from the noise and movement to be , York had the horses tied up , five saddled and ten under pack harness . He said , " Howdy . Where you been all day ? And where 's the rest ? " His eyes had the bright , squinted gleam of a man , shaped and colored by weather and space , who could see game where others could n't . " Comin ' along , " Brobeck answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of it . " " You wo n't get it unloaded , sittin ' there at the wheel . We can mante up . " From the pickup Brobeck and Ben took sleeping bags , food , ammunition , their rifles in scabbards , binoculars , heavy clothes , camp utensils , a tent , a folded-up camp stove . Some of the items made York remark , " Jesus Christ , why all the plunder ? I said bring clothes , grub , glasses and your rifles . Think I 'm a two-bit outfitter ? " Brobeck gave him his plowed-face smile . " Just afraid you might be runnin ' shy , Jap . If it was just you , you 'd make your fire with a couple of sticks , cook your meat on a willow stick , feed your face by hand , rump up on a rock for a bed and howl at the moon . " York went to a horse and returned with ropes and canvasses . He said , " Help mante up , you smart-ass sheriff as never caught anything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save for rifles , ammunition and binoculars , laid them on canvas squares and wrapped and roped them with a dexterity Ben could only watch and admire . Then , with equal dexterity , they lifted the packs to the pack horses , balancedthe loads and made their hitches . They had just finished when Spence Green and Earl Kilmerp161drove up . After greetings they brought their own rifles , ammunition , extra clothing and glasses from the car and with them a cartonthat held half a case of whiskey . " Well , now , " York said , seeing the whiskey , " we 'll call it square , your bein ' late , seein ' as you brung a necessity . I 'll even thank you , for it gets boresome waitin ' at the still . " Kilmer was uncorking a bottle . He said , " You ought to know . " The reference was to York 's reputation as a moonshiner during Prohibition . York took the bottle and drank . " It was thirsts like yours drove me to it . " When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Here 's to the one good thing I can say for the New Deal . Repeal . But if Roosevelt cuts the dollar any lower , it 's back to the still for you , Jap . " York shook his head . " Too deep for me , boys . Spendin ' ourselvesbroke so as to be prosperous . " While he made a pack of the whiskey and extra clothes the two men had brought and hitched it on a horse , the others waited . Since those days of ten years ago Earl Kilmer 's face , once so smooth and pure in the possession of right , had grown a fine fret of wrinkles . They gave him the appearance of a quizzical humor until you looked in his eyes , which were unsmiling and fixed on unrevealed goals . Time had n't changed the essential man , Ben reflected , except to add a waiting and shrewd calculation . Spence Green appeared to be what he was , a pharmacist and drugstore owner careful with prescriptions both medical and financial . A good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown a little too fat . " ' Bout ready , " York called as he examined the packs . Here , down in the canyon , the night 's chill hung on , untouchedyet by the sunshine on the shouldering mountains . The mountains rose all around , their bases blue-dark in the gathering light . A growth of aspens strung along a ridge began to gleam in drill gold . Except for clumps of wild daisies the flowers of summerwere gone , the broad-leaf fireweed along the bank shrunkenp162to a tangle of stems . Some chokecherries hung purple on a bush that had lost most of its leaves . Where grass grew , the frost whitenedit . An old man 's stubble of beard on the face of Mother Earth , Ben thought , feeling the chill push through his clothes . He moved , and the stubble crunched under foot . " Climb on , " York said after assigning each man his saddle horse , and Brobeck said to Ben , " Tenderfoot , see your cinch is snug and try out your stirrups for length . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he knew that much without being told . They set off , York in the lead with a string of five pack horses , then Brobeck with five , then Kilmer , then Green . Ben was well content to be at the tail . Looking behind him to see all was in order , York called to Ben , " Just twelve  --  fourteen miles . Stick ass to saddle , boy . " The trail led through willows , through cottonwoods , through pines , through little clearings , rising and falling , leaving the stream and returning . The sun climbed over the mountains and shone gently at first , then so hot that Ben , like the others ahead , pulled to a stop , dismounted , took off his coat and tied it in back of the saddle . Mile by slow mile the stream dwindled . Where the trail ran close to it , trout moved in silver-black flashes , weasel-swift in alarm . Then there was no more stream but a swampy spring and near it bright falls of water from last winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Above the spring they came to a mountain of coarse shale , an unsurmountable mountain , so high that a man had to arch his back and strain his neck to see its top ; and the trail tackled it by switchbacks , narrow switchback on switchback , the hairpin turns so acute that each horse almost had to double back on itself . Gazingdown while he let his horse choose its footing , Ben could imagine a slide , one that would tumble man and horse down and bury them and bury the spring and rumble to rest , damming the canyon without help of machine . Here , near the summit , he could look eastward over the tops ofp163the mountains they had snaked through and see the sunny plains stretching to the horizon and their small dottings of homesteads and wheat elevators . At the summit York held up his string . His eyes roamed the canyoned valley from which they had climbed , and his mouth moved , saying words that Ben could n't make out . Were they , " Look well . Look well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meanders of the stream , to the small parks , to the brush and trees that , wanting water , drank from the river and in time would be drowned . From this height all appeared diminished , delicate and dear as a child 's careful construction , not to be disturbed by the meddling of grownups . Even so . Even so . Better to restore bounce to life than to leave things as they were because they were what they were . Better to spend yourself broke so as to be prosperous . If you could do so . If only you could . Decision again . Choice again . And again loss . The horses were getting their wind back . They were wet and lathered with sweat , and the smell of it seemed almost visible . They angled down the divide into the drainage of the Medicine . How many more miles ? Ben found himself asking himself . How much longer ? His seat felt raw , and his knees permanently sprung by the stretch of the saddle . But it was plod after plod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his horse ; and this was vacation , all this , vacation from work , time off from troubles , time on for high spirits . Then the horses quickened pace , and at last they arrived at a pole corral beside which lay a few canvas-covered bundles of what must be hay . Off to the side was an irregular circle of fireblackenedstones . The sun had made its swing and , gentle again , shone from the west , just above farther mountains . York rode his horse to a pole , dismounted and tied up . He and Brobeck knew what to do with the packs and horses , and Kilmer stood ready to help . After unsaddling his horse and freeing it insidethe corral , Ben started rustling firewood . From one of the lashings Green had taken an ax . He breathed hard as he used it.  |p164With  the packs on the ground , York led the unsaddled horses insidethe corral , let them roll , hobbled a couple , hung bells on two more and let down the gate . Stooping to light the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the jangling of bells as the bunch surged out to graze . Once the packs were brought close to the fire , York rummaged and took out the bottle they had drunk from before . " Tea time , " he said , uncorking it . " Tea time if only you , Ben , would run to the crick and get a bucket of water . The straight stuff closes my pipes . " There was nothing like a good drink , once it settled , to straighten sprung knees , Ben thought as he passed the tin cup . York scanned the sky and said , " No snow tonight , but we best pitch a tent . It 's a sucker 's game , bettin ' with nature that holds all the aces . Want to lend a hand ? " " I 'll cook . How about it ? " Ben said . " Good . You know where the grub is . " They ate fried potatoes and onions , steaks broiled on an open grill , and drank coffee that Ben had let boil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dessert . York took whiskey instead . Afterwards they sat around the fire , smoking , occasionally feedingthe little blaze , feeling the night 's chill enclose them now that the sun had gone down . The moon bulged the eastern horizon and grew into a great , golden disc , and the camp and the mountainsassumed outline and detail . " The way it is , " York said , " us outfitters each of us got our territoriespretty well fixed . Not strict , you understand , but still more or less . That do n't mean that outside parties ca n't hunt here , amateurparties , I mean , but most of them are too busy makin ' heap big wages at the dam and catchin ' up on debts to their bellies . " Ben saw the men nod , as if what had been said was no news to them . " What you do n't know , " York continued , " is that this year , not like last year or the years before , the elk voted for my territory . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bein ' grazed off , hadp165got better here . It 'll take careful huntin ' , but there 's elk around . " " I 'm heading up the Medicine in the morning , " Kilmer said , not as if he desired company . " I know where . " The moonlight and firelight exaggerated the fine fret of his wrinkles . " I 'll take out for Beaver Creek , " Brobeck announced . " How about it , Spence ? " " Sure , but that leaves Ben . " " I 'll tend camp , " Ben said . " Me'n you both , " York put in . " Now I 've got whiskey and found me a cook , I figure to loaf . " Brobeck edged a few sticks into the fire . The moon in its rise had turned from gold to silver . The step-by-step ring of the horse bells sounded soft in the night . " One other thing , " York said , his eyes on the fire . " There 's an old she-grizzly around . I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kilmer asked , " Why not ? It 's legal . " " She come here last year from the Yellowstone country or maybe the Flathead with a gimp in her leg where somebody shot her , and she 's old and alone , and there ai n't many of her kind around anywhere anymore  --  not anymore  --  and I guess she do n't see much future before her . It all makes her pretty short in her temper . " " What 's that got to do with it ? " Kilmer asked . York kept looking at the fire , and it struck Ben that he might be equating himself with the bear as the losing survivor of change . " Last year , " York said , " she treed an assistant ranger and kept him up on a limb for two or three hours . And he was n't doin ' anything to get up her dander except he caught her unaware-like . He had took off from the station  --  you know , Ben , Gates Park , maybe four miles from here  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studyin ' wildlife and tree growth and such , but she did n't like it . " " I still do n't see , " Kilmer said . York gave the fire a small smile . " And the forest-fire lookout "  --  he moved his thumb again  --  " he climbed off his perchp166to exercise his legs , and she came rollin ' out of the brush . He was lucky he could fly up to his tower , leavin ' only the seat of his pants for her to remember him by . " York paused , still with his small smile , and went on . " Sour Sow , we began callin ' her , but the nice game warden felt it fell shy of bein ' quite proper , and besides , he stutters . By the time he 'd got Sour Sow ' off his tongue , he disremembered his lines . So now we call her Sweet Sue , though it does n't help his stutterin ' much . " Brobeck asked , " Did you ever see her ? " " Sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " It was Kilmer asking . " I did n't shoot , " York said and left the why unanswered . " If you had , " Brobeck put in , " she would n't be around now . " York looked at Brobeck . He might have nodded . He got upand said , " Time to bed down . " Lying face to the sky , Ben could imagine men like themselves gathered around the fire of the moon , hunters and nonhunters and lonely survivors under the felt weight of space . They would be talking about leaders and policies , about money wasted as against the saving of lives , about wilderness exploited or left pristine , about dreams versus practicality , and each would make a good case and leave judgment shaky . And they would be talking , or maybe just thinking , each man to himself , about sex and fidelity and justified exceptions to code , and here again , for reasons generalor personal , revealed or kept secret , they would be divided , insideand out , and unsure in decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyelids closed out and floated around it , and he asked moon and bear , " Where are the clean choices ? "  |p167THE  MORNING COLD had lifted and was lifting still more as the sun climbed above the ragged wall of the mountains to eastward . The frost that earlier had bleached the grass had melted , and its hangingdrops were little suns on the stems . All the same , as he washed navy beans , Ben 's hands cramped in the water just brought up from the river . York paused in his aimless strolling to say , " Do n't look too good . I thought to hear shots by this time , or maybe the breeze ai n't just right . " They had risen before dawn , York to bring in the horses , Ben to kindle a fire and prepare bacon and eggs . From his sleeping bag Brobeck had said , " Go to it , Ben . Keep up the good work . Us hunters need a wink of sleep more . " A little later the three had rolled out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having eaten , ridden away , Kilmer with only one pack horse , Brobeck and Green with two . York sat down on a fallen log and filled his pipe . " You do n't have to wash the face of every damn bean , " he said . " You tend to your horses . " " Tended to already . I 'll keep ' em up for a while just in case . It do n't hurt to get ' em used to the corral and a couple forkfuls of hay . " Ben drained off the wash water , put in fresh , added salt pork and nudged the pot into the fire . " Reminds me , " York said , taking the pipe from his teeth , " I knew a man hereabouts lived on sowbelly and beans . Used to drink the grease from the pan . It killed him . "  | " I 'll throw these out . " " Nope . Steady diet , it was , and some damn disease so rare the doctors got onto it too late to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That shows what wide readin ' does for a man . Pellagra is right . " They were just filling in time , waiting on events , while , over and beyond and underneath what was said , York listened . No word , no tone of voice , Ben thought , could keep him from hearing . York went about setting up the camp stove , saying , " Who hankers to circle round a damn fire so 's to keep smoke out of his eyes ? Should have done this before . We 'll kindle her later . " He sat down again and knocked out and filled his pipe , lighting it with a twig he had held in the fire . When they fell silent , there was nothing to listen to except the voice of the stream and the occasional cries of a proud-crested Steller 's jay , so vivid on his pine perch as to pale the sky . Silence closed them in , the great voice of silence , waiting for the fracture of gunshot . Save for the jay , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature below . The world lay open to settlement . With a stick Ben nudged coals around the bean pot . The mountains had marked York , Ben thought , the mountains and distance and solitude . There was little his eye would miss or his ear not hear , and , if neither functioned , he would still be aware , drawing on a sense most men lacked . On impulse he asked , " Mind telling me how old you are , Jap ? " " Somewhere around fifty . Fifty-five , maybe . A man loses track . " " And already you 're counting yourself as a relic . " " I been in the mountains , off and on , mostly on , since I was a pup . Let me see . Call it nineteen hundred or a little before . The outside do n't have a hold on me , not now , not anymore , barrin ' the whiskey sold there . " " It has n't changed that much . " " So you say . Speakin ' of whiskey , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water into a tin cup and offered the drink to Ben . He sat down with the cup after Ben had taken a sip . " A man in town , " York said , " he just sees strangers walkin ' the street and goddamn radios playin ' what he do n't want to hear , and everybody yappin ' for progress , and the air foul with engine farts . Give me the good smell of horseshit . Let me hear a coyote . " He did n't need to be reminded that they had heard them last night , in the early dark and at dawn , singing their laments to the sky . Ben said , " You ca n't go back , lap . Not today . " " That do n't mean we have to be hell-bent for tomorrow . " " People , jobs , come ahead of things . " " That race is run , and no winners , when things play out . " " That 's beyond any time we can see . " " My time , anyhow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , and Ben got up and gathered more firewood . The knock of the ax sounded small . He came back to the fire , fed it and sat down , and it was then that they heard the shot . It sounded as a faint boom and then gained volume and rolled through the hills . " Brobeck ? " Ben said . " No , Kilmer . One shot . Listen . " But the one shot was all . The silence closed in again , like a great , muting hand . York had his pipe going . He said along the stem , " He 's not what I would call a dead shot . I 've taken him in here before . " He blew out a breath of smoke and added , as if he found one note of grace , " Well , shit , he pays me . " He rose , went to the corral , caught up a horse and threw a pack saddle on it . His own horse stood saddled , cinch loose . Returning , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that just to keep his pecker up , figurin ' he would n't come back with no more than a rabbit that might get tromped on , but if he 's lucked into an elk  --  " The words trailed off . He sat down again and again knocked out and loaded his pipe and , smoking , waited ; and it was as if he could endure time andp170development , minutes and hours and what was to come , as if he had learned patience from hills with no clocks . But Ben knew he was alert . He did n't need to flick his ears like an animal or sniff the wind or lift his head and stare . Ben stirred the beans , made sure they were cooking and asked , " Coffee ? " " Not when there 's whiskey . Mow about buildin ' a cup ? " Ben did so and passed the drink , then took a small swallow himself and gave the cup hack . He sat on the log with York . Counted by the minute , time dawdled . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its passing incredible and memory confused in the mix of dates and events . Ben had heard someone say that , to pass a short winter , sign a promissory note that fell due in the spring . But time hurried on , note or no note . It did , save for now when they reckoned it minute by minute , half-hour by half-hour . The sun had lagged up to high noon . A little breeze worried the campfire and went on . The horses in the corral were beginning to nose one another , to stamp hooves and switch tails as the warming day gave life to the flies . A shot sounded among the hills , then , after a long , waiting moment , another , and York said , " That 's Brobeck . Got an elk , you can bet . Second shot was a make-sure or maybe for mercy . " He was about to relight his pipe and relax but of a sudden held up . It was an instant before Ben could hear the pound of hooves and the flap of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galloped into the campground , pulled to a halt and swung from his horse . York had risen and gone forward , Ben behind him . Kilmer said , " I shot me a bear , a big grizzly . " " Dead ? " " As good as . It got into the bushes . " " As good as ! My ass . " Kilmer stepped toward York . He put both hands out . " Now wait a minute . " The words came in a rush . " It 's probably already dead , and I 'm going back , but two guns are better than one in that cover , and I thought you 'd want to come along as back-up . "  | " I told you we was n't bear huntin ' . " " I know , but I rather surprised it , and it acted as if it might charge . " " Sweet Sue do n't bluff . Where 's the pack horse ? " " I left it . " " Just dandy . Now where at is the bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a point there . " " Shot just once , huh , just the once ? " " I was lucky to get one shot in . " " Shit ! And her makin ' for the thicket and all . " " You do n't believe me ? " York did n't answer . He turned to Ben . " We 'll saddle up , Ben . Ca n't leave her suffer , or for some poor bastard to stumble upon . " York made for the corral , and Kilmer ran up and tugged at his arm . " What the hell ? I 'm going along . " York shook off the hand and turned long enough to say , " Not on one of my horses , you ai n't . Just see to the one you rode in . " " It 's my bear . " " My horses . Come on , Ben . " He caught up a saddle horse and bridled it as Ben threw on a saddle . Then he bridled his own horse and tightened the cinch , led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both mounted . York took the lead . As they rode away , Ben looked toward Kilmer , standing slumped , the fret of his wrinkles set deep in an expression no longer puckish . Kilmer watched them go from the clearing . York set a fast pace , not trot or gallop or lope , but the steady , long-striding walk that the trail called for and that only , Ben thought , a trained mountain man could get out of his mount . Now and then , falling behind , he had to set his horse to a jog to catch up . Except for an infrequent , " Goddamn , " that carried back , York was silent , though once he turned to say over his shoulder , " No guts . He spooked . That 's Mr. Earl Kilmer . " The stony trail twisted among boulders , through spare stands of timber , and climbed high above the river , where it narrowed to a mere goat path along the side of a cliff , and wound down to bot/torn land and low growth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their eyes . Ahead , a horse whinnied  --  the pack horse , it must be , that Kilmer had left . They came to it a quarter of a mile farther on . It was straining at its tie rope and swinging side to side but calmed down when it saw it had company . " We 'll tie up here , " York said . " Do n't want ' em spooked and breakin ' away . " With the horses secured , York slid his rifle from the scabbard , saying as he did so , " Get your shootin ' iron , Ben . " The sight of it brought an exclamation . " By God , a peashooter . " " I should have told you . I 'm not a hunter . I do n't know why you brought me along . " " You better'n Kilmer . " A smile without humor touched York 's mouth . " I aimed to shame him , the son of a bitch . One lonesomebear , and he 's got to shoot it and then run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do n't matter , your gun . It 'll do as a come-on . Loaded ? " " Few shells in my pocket . " " Put ' em in , " York said and examined his own rifle . " Let 's go . " They mounted a small crest and angled down toward the river , and ahead , where another stream joined it , Ben could see a finger of land tangled with windfall , flood drift , willows , and dead highgrownweeds . York watched right and left as he walked . He tested for breeze , tossing grass stems and pinches of duff into the air and watching which way they went . " Upwind is the ticket , " he said . " A bear ca n't see worth a damn , so we let her smell us and see wo n't she charge on the bait . Only if worst comes to worst do I aim to fart around in that woodpile . " " Kilmer might have missed . " " Could be , and I hope so , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halt perhaps twenty-five yards from the nearest point of the tangle . " Two shots , easy , at this range if she charges , and that ought to change her mind , even allowin ' that a grizzly can carry a cartload of lead . Now you stand over there , Ben , out of the way , and take pot shots into that jumble . "  | " Random , you mean ? " " Yeah . Look good first . Ca n't see her from here . " There was nothing to see , only the downed logs and the thicket of willows and the tall weeds . Nothing moved there . Ben levered a cartridge into the chamber and fired . A second of waiting , and the willows thrashed and bent aside and out of them broke the bear , stretching and humping in an unevenrun , the sun shining silver on the tips of her fur . Throat sounds came from her and the gut-rumble of strain . She headed for Ben . Almost in the observing instant York 's rifle cracked . The bullet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whoof and got a new hold on earth and came on , now veering toward York . York was on one knee , his hands working at the breech of his rifle , working where it had jammed , his attention all on it as if the one problem absorbed him , bear or no bear , world or no world . That much Ben had time to see before he swung up his rifle and fired . He fired again , seeing puffs where the bullets struck and the bear oblivious . The bear reared and swiped at York . She knocked him over . She dropped and enveloped him . Ben ran forward . He squatted for an eye or ear shot safe for York . The firing pin clicked on an empty chamber . He jerked up and reversed the rifle and slammed it against the great head of the bear and heard the crack of the stock and the mad throat sounds . York 's rifle ! Underneath . No chance ! A part of York 's face wrenched free from the bear 's bite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye disappeared , and the bear strangled out through its teeth , " Run for it ! Run ! " The broken gun was a hindrance , carried forgetfully . Ben cast it to one side as he fled . The horses snorted and lunged at the sight of him , and he slowed down and spoke to them and untied his own animal . It was wild to be off and set out at a run when he got one foot in a stirrup . His right leg dangled until at last he could lift it over the cantle . No time to spare the horse . No use to rein it . No excuse top174think about leg smashed against tree or a fall down a cliff . Hang on and let run . A stitch struck his side . The pace pounded him . He heard the wheeze of his breath . Here was the campground , and there were Green and Kilmer and Brobeck , Brobeck bending down over a section of carcass . Their eyes lifted wide . " York ! " The word came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , hunter 's knife in his hand . " What , Ben ? Easy , now . " The two others were coming up . " It 's York . Bear 's killing him . Hurry ! " They stared , unbelieving , and then , believing without further talk , ran and caught horses and flung saddles on . They streamed out , single-file , Brobeck leading , and kicked their horses . Ben 's followed , winded . A nightmare under the pleasant sky . A dread dream among quiet bushes and trees and the peaceful windings of trail . A reaching cry , silent in silence . The stitch left his side . There was no movement near the finger of land and no sound . At first sight there was only a big bear in a sprawl . The horses shied off from it , snorting . Brobeck swung off . He said , " Hold the horses , Kilmer , Green , one of you . " He went to the bear , gun at the ready , and poked her with the barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underneath , " he said , though Ben had seen . " Here , lend a hand , Ben . " Hands on hindfoot and forefoot , they dragged the bear off . A " Holy Jesus ! " came out of Brobeck . There lay York , or what once had been York . A flap of raw scalp covered most of his face . Punctures and cracks marked the bone of his skull . Brobeck felt for pulse on wrist and chest . Back to Ben , he lifted the flap of scalp and laid it again over the face , saying , " Do n't look . " Of a sudden he rose . " You , Kilmer , Green , head for the ranger station . Get help . Get a doctor flown in , no matter he 's dead . " " Both of us ? " Kilmer asked . " Both . You ca n't do anything here . Might help out there.  |p175Take  off ! " He had assumed a tone of command , an air of commandnew to Ben . " Ben , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , Brobeck said , " Wait , " and untied a yellow slicker from in back of his saddle . Kilmer and Green were leaving . The slicker , Ben saw on his return , covered York 's face and part of his body . A couple of blowflies were investigating the bloody mouth of the bear . Brobeck sat down on the ground close to York 's body . One hand kept hitting at the gathering flies . The other held his rifle upright , butt down . He said , " Goddamn blowflies . They come out of nowhere at the smell , or whatever , of dead flesh , and they go back to nowhere when it cools off . " His hand made another sweep . " Care to tell me how it all came about , Ben ? " Ben sat down beside him and told him in detail and ended up asking , " But what else could I do , Frank ? What else ? " " Nothing . Not a God 's thing . Now quit faulting yourself . Quit sounding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what most men would n't have done . There 's nothing to forgive . " It was an idle thought , dodging in and out of mind , that Brobeckunder strain , in the company of death , used proper language . His day-by-day speech was an accommodation to custom . Brobeck 's hand moved again . " In a way it is fitting . Two of a kind , you might say . " " And both kinds getting scarce . " " I guess York would have had it this way . " " If he had to go . He was a friend of the bear , if she only knew it . " " You can stretch it and say ; maybe , that she was a friend of his . I wo n't , though . When a man like York goes , you can only damn life . " Ben offered cigarettes , and they smoked . The sun shafted through the thin screen of trees to the west . In silence they waited and drew on their cigarettes and rubbed them out under foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crest of a mountain . The blowflies were fewer . It had been a day of waiting , a long day of waiting , with Yorkp176alive and then dead . York was still waiting if resurrection were more than a myth . He would have enough patience . Dusk came on and night , a bright night with creeping chill in it . No longer did Brobeck have to fan away flies . At last they arrived , Kilmer and Green and two men from the Forest Service , one of them leading a couple of pack mules . " I 'm Butler , " the first of them said after dismounting . " This is Fairbury . A doctor 's flying in in the morning . No use , though , from what I 've been told . " Brobeck had risen . He shook hands and introduced Ben . " No use at all , " he said , " except to make a report . " Butler stepped toward York 's body . He took off his straightbrimmedForest Service hat . " Look if you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though . " Butler 's eyes went to the bear . " One nuisance removed . More than a nuisance , a danger . " " High price to pay . " " Yeah . I guess so . " Butler kneeled to feel the wrist of York 's outflung hand . " Already cooling off , " he said . " We 'll take him to the station and fly him home in the morning . " Home . Where was York 's home if not where he lay ? " We brought a litter and poles , " Butler went on . " The mules are used to packing in tandem . Wo n't be one bump . Fairbury , you want to bring the tackle ? " " Sure thing . " Kilmer had wandered up the trail away from the rest . Maybe he had no stomach for blood and death and what had to be done . It was more likely , though , that he felt indrawn and blameworthy for what had happened . Ben had a quick touch of sympathy , feelingsomehow guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wrapped York 's body in canvas , placed it on the litter and lifted and tied the litter to the poles . " You 'll be in to report ? " Butler asked Brobeck after he 'd mounted his horse.  | " All of us in the morning . " Now , from up the trail to their camp , Kilmer 's voice called . " Hey , Ben , I found your rifle . You must have fallen and broken it , getting away . " Ben could hear Brobeck say , under his breath , " Son of a bitch ! " Then he spoke out . " All right . Let 's go . "  |p178FRANK  BROBECK woke up early . The alarm clock glowed in the creeping light and said five-thirty , but he hardly needed it to tell him the time . He could always guess within fifteen minutes of right . It was too early to have to get up , though his woman , an early riser , already was gone from the bed . He could hear her in the kitchen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he liked . A good wife , he had . She was his woman , and he was her man , faithful to her barring a time or two , long ago now , when he 'd jumped the reservation and felt bad about it . Maybe she was n't the knockout she once was , but , hell , when had he ever been ? He rolled over in bed . The day 's work and worry would come soon enough . He would doze and think pleasant thoughts , not , for Christ 's sake , about his friend , Ben Tate , whom people were looking at , their eyes questioning . What they wanted to know was was it true that Ben had run away when Jap York was being mauled and chewed to death by the bear ? Had he been scared shitless and turned tail and fallen and splintered the rifle he could have used ? You did n't have to look long to find the weasel in the woodpile there . You could hear Earl Kilmer saying something like , " I 'm just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . The broken rifle and all . I was n't there at the actual time and do n't claim I was , so do n't get me wrong . I do n't know what I would have done in Tate 's place . Tackle that bear or get the hell away ? Tackle , I hope , but a man never knows until the time comes . Anyhow , York 's dead , and that 's the end of that , and I do n't want to say any more.  |p179The  sneaky bastard . If he had had any sense , Brobeck thought , he would n't have let Ben junk the gun in the rocks that were covered by snow now , since winter came early and cold in the mountains . It would show it had been fired . It might have bear hair in the cracks of the stock . But Ben had said , " Useless ! " and pitched it away as if mighty few things were of use . If he had had any sense , he would have skinned out that mangy old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One hell of a thinker , the high sheriff was . One hell of a law officer , and one hell of a smart politician to boot . Sure , at the time , with York torn up and dead , everyone was upset . Everything was a muddle . Who would have thought to save a bad-broken rifle that was n't much good in the first place ? Who would have thought to peel the shabby hide off the grizzly ? But there was no excuse there for a man with a head on his shoulders . The only one with a head had been Kilmer . Fine doings , that ! He might as well get up and lay off the brain plague , but it was too early yet except for more of the same . What in hell use were words against doubt ? What use were his words ? What use would Ben 's be if he knew of the fix he was in and spoke out ? To deny a thing was kind of to sow the seeds of it . And even people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions out of their minds . There were some who would n't try to do that much . You had to know Ben before you passed judgment . You had to size him up careful . See his newspaper and look at the stands he took . Think about bracing that bear , and nothing to do it with but the club of an empty gun . Ask how he won a captaincy duringthe war and find out it was n't by shuffling papers . Ben was a quiet man , or pretty quiet , quieter now than he used to be , and there was maybe a fault . Or was it a credit to him , what you might call the mark of the years ? It took a long time to grow up , Brobeck reflected , thinking far back to Ben in his crazy gunny-sack pants and himself with booze iu his belly and a chip on his shoulder . Days of extra-high spiritp180and a man so full of piss and vinegar that he did n't have to stop and think , or thought he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what they were though they would n't own up to it , fuzzyheadstrying to get their asses behind them . Time and happenings put their butts in place , more or less , and made their stands solider . But years and hindsight did n't make a man sure enough to be sure sure , not if he had ally brains . Neither did the goddamn nature of things . So his ass was never quite fixed or at ease in one spot . It was almost a relief when his bedside telephone rang , though the boys knew damn well not to call him except in emergencies . He lifted the receiver and , clearing his throat , got out " Brobeck . " " Skeeter Jerome here . " " All right . " " George was skittish about getting you out of bed . " " Good for him . " " You know Pinkie Adams , he gets up early to go to the station and see if there 's anything hot on the wire and all that . " " I do n't need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , he went by Billie Gayle 's place and saw the door open and peeked in , and there was Billie dead on the floor . He hustled down to the office . Pinkie , I mean . " " That 's too damn bad . " " Worse to come . Billie was strangled . There 's a wire around his neck . " At the end of his breath Brobeck said , " Jesus ! " " Thought you 'd want to know . " " A goddamn mind reader , you are . " " Hold your horses . It was n't me did it . " " You been there ? " " Right . I left George in charge . " " I 'm on the way . " Brobeck lunged out of bed and hustled into his clothes . About to leave the room , he turned and went back to the phone . After three buzzes Tate 's voice came on . " Ben , " Brobeck said , " some son of a bitch throttled Billie  --  Billie Gayle  --  last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead ? " " In his club . I 'm settin ' out . " He hung up before ' fate could ask more . " Just coffee , Stella , " he said in the kitchen . " And damn quick , girl ! " She poured it before her face asked him what . " Billie Gayle 's dead . Murdered . " He went to cool the coffee at the kitchen tap . She was saying , " Oh , no , Frank ! Now who in the world  --  ? " Between gulps he told her , " Who ? ' is the question . " He slammed out the door . It was a miracle of Jesus the way people gathered around violent death no matter the hour . It was as if some devil of curiosity aroused them from sleep or diverted them from their travels to work . Or was it just that murder was a welcome spice to workaday lives ? Already , by the time he pulled up to the curb , there was a group around Billie Gayle 's door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deputy Chet George just inside the entrance . George said , " God , am I glad you 're here ! " " Stand aside . Let me see . " George moved his big bulk . " You wo n't want to look twice . " Billie lay spraddled , face up . After a glance at the face and one away from it , Brobeck made himself look at the cord or wire that was almost invisible in the trench it had dug round the neck . He said to George , " Get me a bar towel . Get a doctor . Get the coroner . You have n't moved him ? " " God , no . Not me . " Brobeck covered the face with the towel . He watched George go out . Then he went to the door and said to the gawkers , " Look , a man 's been murdered , strangled . That 's all I can say . That 's all I know . Wo n't you move off now ? Go about your business ? There 's not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little crowd Pinkie Adams said , " I just happened to dhv a glance in , and there he was . " " Yeah . I know . Move away and tell them about it . "  |p182They  moved but not far . Maybe his words would keep them out from under foot , though . The group had increased . Spence Green was the latest addition . Now Tate made his way through . " You can read all about it , " Brobeck announced . Three or four of the men stepped forward , as if where the press had a right to go , so did they . " I 'm deputizing Tate , " Brobeck told them . " All right , Ben . " He laid back the bar towel that covered Gayle 's face . He pointed to the wire . " Waitin ' on the coroner and doctor , " he said . " Have to , I guess . " In a voice that was more breath than tone , Tate said , " York . Now Billie Gayle . " Brobeck put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couldmake Billie Gayle look any worse . That goddamn wire . " Tate did n't answer . There was a set around his mouth Brobeckhad n't seen there before . He was pale . Who in hell would n't be ? " Ben , " he said , " you willin ' to be my deputy ? " " More than . " " I do n't know as I 'll need you except ask some questions . That 's your knack . Now would you push them eager loafers back from the door ? " While Tate did so , Brobeck straightened and moved to the counter . Should have done that before , he told himself , instead of making himself want to puke . The cash drawer beyond the counter hung open . It was robbery , then , robbery and murder for the sake of a few cents . A dumb-headed act by whomever . Exceptfor the drawer , everything seemed in order . Billie must have been ready to lock up for the night when someone came in , noosed his neck , took the cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart officer in a well-equipped office would be looking for fingerprints , he supposed . But for whom and for what in a patronizedplace ? Besides , you could n't try to match prints with everybody in town . Doc Crabtree came in with his kit . That was like him , old as he was . First on the scene , whereas the two younger men in the local profession would have to shave and shower and eat a well/balanced breakfast . Doe 's knees cracked as he stooped by the body . He took off the towel and felt of the flesh . " Dead quite a while , " he said . " Late last night or very early this morning at a guess . " I figured so . " " Strangling is quick . " Doc shook his head slowly . " Just a moment of terror , agony , then nothing . Let 's turn him over , Frank . " " Better than facing him , " Brobeck said , lending a hand . Doe 's eyes came to him . " Frank , death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Never mind . Undertakers can doll up a corpse . " His eyes and hands moved to the wire where it was twisted . " I 'll get this thing off . " It was haywire , common haywire , that anyone might find in a truck or a pickup . Holding it up , Doc said , " Catch the bastard . " Lawrence Chiles , undertaker who doubled as coroner , interruptedthem , asking as he approached , " Now what have we here ? " " See for yourself , " Doc answered . " He 's all yours . " " Looks like it , sure enough . Someone really put the strangle on him . " " With this , " Doc said and held out the wire . " Help turn him over , will you ? As coroner I got to see . " Then , the body turned , he added , not as if fazed , " What I expected . Ever see a case before , Doc ? " " Suicides with a rope . " " Well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one way or anotherdeath comes to everybody . " " Not with a goddamn wire round your neck , " Brobeck broke in . " Not when you 're a cripple already . Not when you 're goddamn unable to protect yourself . " " Now hold off , Frank . No offense meant . I was just saying we all got to die . A lot of survivors find comfort in that thought . " " Shit ! " " All right . All right . Do n't blame you being upset . Doc , can I take him away now ? I got the ambulance and everything out-side. "  | " Any time . " " You 'll report ? " " For what it 's worth . " Chiles went out . In his place at the doorway Chet George appeared . " Give Chiles a hand , George , " Brobeck said . On the street the group had grown to twenty or twenty-five people , whom Tate was discouraging from closer approach . Voices asked : " What about it , Frank ? " " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe it 's Billie . " He answered , " Billie Gayle . Stone dead . Somebody strangled him . That 's all I can tell you . Let the coroner through , will you ? " " No one who knew Billie would do him in , " Pinkie Adams announced . Brobeck told the crowd , " I figure that 's right . Any of you got a hunch ? See a stranger ? Suspect anybody ? " Silent , they looked one at another . " If any of you call to mind anything  --  it do n't matter , little or big  --  come tell me right off . " Chiles and George carne out with the body , covered by a sheet . " It 's over . Make way , please . And let 's go about our business . " He halted George long enough to say , " You stick around , Chet . See they do n't mess up the place . " He and Tate moved away . " What next ? " Tate asked . " See if anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report at the office or I would 've been told , but a man that would murder Billie for what he had in the till , he 's not likely to have a machine of his own . " I 'd ask at the beer parlors , too . " " Any more great ideas , Ben ? Sure , they 're likely places . But a man would n't bust in on Billie for booze . He did n't handle it . " " For the price of booze , then , if he was dying for a drink . Or , perhaps already drunk , he just chanced on Billie and thought easy pickings . " " Maybe . Let 's walk on down to the Arfive House and talk to Jim Sowder . He 's the best bet . "  | " Yes , sir , " Sowder answered to their questions . Ile stood behind the bar , a fat man with a mustache through which he 'd strained plenty of beer . A half-empty glass of it rested close to his hand . " Just maybe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the house , gents . " At their refusal he said , " Great waker-upper . " Brobeck asked , " Just what is it you have ? " " Well , I s'pose it boils down to nothin ' , but there was a strangerhere yesterday . Said he was a barber and figured to set up shop . Ido n't know what with . He did n't have a damn dime . " " What did he look like ? " " Medium tall . Comin ' on to middle age . No whiskers . No hat , and that was funny . Who you see with no hat ? I ask you . " " Go on . " " His hair was climbin ' back from his forehead , and his head was kind of flat on top . " Sowder lifted his glass with a plump hand and drained it . " Clothes ? " Sowder used the bar towel on his mustache . " Ordinary , like a workin ' man . One of those jumper jackets . Denim , I guess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him earlier . " " Christ , man , I just came down from upstairs . Ai n't really open yet . First I knew was a minute ago someone told me Billie Gayle 's dead . " " All right . Anything else ? " " Well , the stranger , he looked kind of dopey , like he 'd spent many a day with a bottle . Tried to borrow the price of a bottle from me against what he 'd make cuttin ' hair . I staked him to a beer . " Sowder drew a fresh one for himself . " Tip me off if you remember any additions . Oh , anyone besidesyou get a look at him ? " " Quiet night . Jesus , a few more of them and I go belly up . ' I ' lie goddamn legislature ought to quit fuckin ' around and let a man sell whiskey and such by the drink . " " Anyone else , I asked . "  | " There was a couple of machine operators . I know ' em but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diggin ' a canal or something . They aimed to get back on the job early . " Two other bartenders said yes , they 'd seen such a stranger . He was trying to bum drinks but did n't seem drunk , just maybe drying out after one hell of a spree . Yeah , he looked pretty much like Jim Sowder said . Outside , Brobeck said , " We got some kind of a suspect , Ben , and description enough to alert towns around . So back to the officefor me . You might keep diggin ' if you have the time ? " " Time enough , but  --  " " But what ? " " Oh , nothing . " " Nothing , huh ? Now see here , you look like you 've got an idea in your head . " " Maybe the beginning of one . It 's too far-fetched , though . Forget it . " " I do n't want you chasin ' some wild-assed shot in the dark . Not alone . You 're my deputy , remember . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deputy without pay ought to be given some privileges . If I go out on a fool 's errand , let me be the fool . You have your hands full . " " Well , but you take care . Hear ? " Brobeck walked to his car . As he drove it toward the courthouse , he saw Tate , standing still at the curb , lost maybe in thought.  |p187BEN  WAITED until Brobeck 's car was well down the street . Then he walked back toward Jim Sowder 's place . There were comings and goings on the sidewalk , early though it was , people wanting to know more than was known . He answered briefly and went on . Sowder was alone with his beer . He said , " Here again , huh ? Thought better about suds on the house ? " " No more than a short one , then . Thanks . " He swallowed and said , " Jim , about that man you saw ? " " What about him ? I told all I know . " " Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he dried his mustache . " Could be , but how do I know ? Hobos ai n't twins , or quads or quints , or whatever you call it . Excuse me , but I kind of got to swamp out , Ben . Place is a mess . " Without enthusiasm Sowder walked down the counter and took a push broom from a corner . " I can talk , though . " Ben sipped at his beer . The far-out possibility that he would n't mention to Brobeck kept pecking at him . If the man were a hobo , he would n't wait here for a train . If he had any sense at all , he would head for the main line of the railroad and its stopping point thirty miles to the east , there to lose himself on a freight train among a small army of bums . Once aboard , it was goodbye to the scene of the crime . Sowder was saying while he rested the broom , " Know what , Bcn ? Good people wo n't stand for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a rope , me along with them . " " Do n't . It wo n't do , Jim . No lynching . "  | " You can ask anybody . There 's a lot to be said for it . Vigilantes , I mean . Damn right . " Sowder had swept some of the litter in a pile . He returned to the back of the bar as if for another beer and apparently thought better of it . " About that hobo deal , Ben . Hell , we do n't have ' em here . Like you know , passenger traffic , it 's nothin ' , and freights just once in a while to pick up wheat or cattle or sheep . " " There was a freight train through yesterday . " " Yep . Up to the end of the line and right back . Nothin ' unusual , or Pinkie Adams would have said so . Hobos , they want to be where trains are goin ' and comin '  --  on the hour , you might say . Ben finished his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Well , just a wild idea . " " it do n't hurt to ask , foolish or not . " Ben went out and walked toward the office , wondering if the idea was wild , asking himself whether he had kept it from Brobeck because it was wild . Or was it that he hoped to prove something , against the rumors of cowardice he had heard in the wind ? What did it matter ? At the office he typed a note for Mary Jess , telling her he was out on the Billie Gayle story . He drove his car to a gas station and had it filled . It was idle and apart from the business at hand to reflect how many stations had come into being , where once there were only a couple , owned by garages . Now there were eight or so , some of them on the best corners , operated by men who might know enough of mechanics to change a fan belt . He headed east , up the hill from the valley and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right and left , stretched fields of stubble and summer fallow and occasional pasture , so open to sight as to reveal any creatures larger than mice . Ahead , the way lay empty . The sun , two yards up from the skyline , glared at him , and he pulled down the visor , squinting hard . The day would be mild . Late September . Mellow September.  |p189A  prudent man would have brought along a revolver or rifle or shotgun  --  some means of defense or capture . But the suspect was middle-aged by report and unarmed apparently , a stultified addictto alcohol . And this search , as Brobeck would say , was wildassedin the first place . Ahead , far ahead now , was a glimmer of something under the eye of the sun . It came to be two somethings , a pickup and a car at the side of the road . He speeded up and arrived and came to a halt . A man  --  Duke Blakely , he recognized now  --  was working on a tire at the rear of the pickup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came over to him , lug wrench in hand . He was sweating . " Would n't you reckon ? Yes , suh , Ben . " He raised the wrench for emphasis . It trembled to the tremble of his arm . " Some sorry son of a bitch made off with my pickup last night . Right on Main Street , I swear it was . " " Stolen last night ? " " And a good tire ruint . No spare in back , so I reckon I was in luck , or the outfit might be in Dakota . " He lowered the wrench . A whiff of him told that it was whiskey sweat that he sweated . " Did you report it ? " " No dang telephone . I was fixin ' to report it in town when I come on it right here . " " What time last night , Duke ? " " That 's a question that do n't allow for an answer . No , suh. " lle smiled uncertainly . " I do n't work at it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to boot should n't ought to take on a load , but last night some of the boys and me kind of babied up to a jug , and time I looked for my pickup it was n't there . I just figured my young'n had got tired and took it . He 's independent-minded , he is . So one of the boys brought me home . " He pointed to the other machine . " That old wreck of mine ai n't fit to drive . " " How late , though , Duke ? " " I swear I do n't know . Time I got home and located the bed , I just laid down to sleep off the liquor , like a man will , and ' twas n't till after stump I sec I was robbed . " He brought a dirty hand top190the sweat on his forehead . " By God , suh , bottle fever 's bad enough but thievin ' makes it more miserable . " " What about your son ? " " He caught a ride earlier . Gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I got up . " " All right , Duke . You can manage the tire ? " " That 's kindly to think of . Sure I can . But say , Ben , mind tellin ' me why all the questions ? " " Billie Gayle was strangled last night . Now do n't get excited . I 'm on a wild-goose chase . " Blakely 's eyes showed red when they went wide . " My land ! Strangled to death ! Billie Gayle ! " Then , " Want I should chase the goose with you ? " " You have troubles enough , and I can handle any goose I ca n't find . " " Well  --  " Blakely , perhaps relieved at the answer , drew the word out . " I 'll go back to the house soon 's I fix the tire . Need help , I 'll be there , bottle fever or not . " Once again the road was open , save for one car , bound for town , that passed by and rolled up a cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no longer glaring inside . How far could a man walk in how many hours ? How far from the pickup ? How far a hurrying man ? He might have taken to the fields , scanty though the cover was . He might have caught a ride . But round a bend Ben saw him , striding along . The man did n't signal . He kept walking , eyes ahead . Ben braked and said , " Hey ! " The man stopped and turned slowly . He wore no hat . His half-bald head appeared flat . He was dusky of face . His eyes appearedlost , blank as the blank fields around him . Ben got out and walked over . " Where you bound , mister ? " The man did n't answer . " I asked where you 're going . I 'm a deputysheriff . " Not until the man flung back his arm did Ben see he had a rock cupped in his hand . The rock glanced off his head . A fist swung and hit him . He scrambled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake the daze from his head . He could n't see , andp191then he did see the man climbing into his car . He got his feet under him and lurched , still half-bent , and grabbed a leg and pulled the man out . Of a sudden they came to him , the old tricks long forgotten . Of itself his left hand shot out and knocked the man 's chin up , and the heel of his right hand came across and hit the exposed Adam 's apple . The man choked and gurgled and bent , and his hands clutched his throat . Ben hit him again and left him lying . He opened the car trunk and scattered tools as he yanked at a length of clothesline bound around them to keep them from rattling . The man still was gaspingwhen Ben pulled him upright and tied his unprotesting hands . He pushed him around the car , opened the door and said , " Get in ! " The man could n't , not without help . Ben turned the car around . He would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later , maybe he would n't . Leave the interview to the sheriff . But remember what Jim Sowder had said . About the temper of the people . About a rope . About lynching . To take the man in now , in broad daylight , would be asking for trouble . He used his handkerchief on his face . It came away bloody . He left the road in favor of Duke Blakely 's turnoff . The man was breathing easier now , though his tied hands kept rubbing his windpipe . The fight had gone out of him . Just the one try , the final , wild effort , and he had given up when it failed . At a honk of the horn Blakely appeared on the front porch , his expression inquiring . An old , baggy dog managed to take two tops from him and let out one bark . To the man Ben said , " Get out . " With his hands tied , the man could n't work the door catch . lien stepped to the ground , worked it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he told Blakely . Blakely 's wide eyes were busy . They went from face to face and down to the roped hands . " Sure enough , " he said . " Step yourselvesup and come in . " He led the way to a dusty living room crowded by overstuffed furniture . " Sit down , you all . " The man seemed reluctant or too numb to sit . Ben shoved himp192into a chair and took one himself . " We 'd like to wait here a while . " " First off , you ought to see to that head , Ben . " " It 'll wait . " " I did n't get your friend 's name . " " Tell us , " Ben told the man . For the first time , except for gasping and mumbling , the man spoke . " It do n't matter . " His voice was hoarse . " I said tell us . " " Hoffman , then . " " First name ? " " Harry . " Blakely 's gaze turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Killed Gayle , pinched my pickup and all ? " " I have n't asked him . " " Just catched him after a fight , huh ? He do n't look like much for a fact , but him fightin ' is a kind of a giveaway . Right ? " " The sheriff will find out . " " Are you the son of a bitch ? " Blakely asked Hoffman . Hoffman did n't seem to have heard . " Ben , you must for certain patch up your face , I swear , suh . You 're leakin ' blood . Your friend here , it do n't matter about him . Mostly just bruised . " Ben wiped his cheek and forehead with his bloody handkerchief . " Or would you like a drink first ? I been nursin ' my bottle fever along . Feel better , too , a sight better . " " I could use a drink . " Hoffman looked up with a sort of sad expectancy , like a dog , Ben thought , that hoped for a crust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle and two mismatched glasses . He put them on a scarred table and went to the kitchen again and returned with a tin pitcher of water . His hands were steady as he poured . He sat down and drank and asked after a swallow , " Want we should leave out your friend ? " " Depends on you . I 'd give him one . "  | " Dumb bastard looks like he needs it . But them hands , Ben , they 're goin ' to drop off . " It was n't until then that Ben saw Hoffman 's hands had grown pale and puffy from the tightness of clothesline . " You have a gun , Duke ? " " Sure thing . Old Betsy , right in the kitchen . " " You might bring it  --  and a glass for Hoffman . " " I 'll untie him and pour him a drink , " Ben said on Blakely 's return . " You keep the gun on him , just in case , but , Duke , rememberhe goes to the sheriff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shootin ' a cow . " Ben undid the clothesline . Hoffman had trouble holding the glass , but his eyes seemed to say thanks . " All right , Duke . You hold him there , and I 'll go tend to my face . " " Washroom off the kitchen . Basin and water there and maybe some stickin ' tape . " The side of his forehead was bruised from the stone and had a gash in it . Blood was smeared down to his jaw . The bruise was swollen and would darken later . He used a washcloth and soap but could n't find court plaster . " I 'm sorry it 's going to be a long day , " he told Blakely once he had washed up . " So ? Nobody here but us three , what with my missus dead and my kid workin ' out . Chores can wait . Have another drink . " Ben fixed whiskey for the three of them while Blakely watched , gun in hand . Some kind of dim life seemed beginning to show in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company , day or night , " Blakely said , lifting his glass . " I want to take him in after dark , " Ben said , answering an unasked question . " People in town are worked up . " Blakely let out a long " Oh , " then added , " a rope party maybe , von mean ? " " That 's what I mean . " " By God , no good , suh . No good . I seen one down South . Ip194was sort of on the fringe of the mob , takin ' part , you might say . " To their surprise Hoffman croaked , " What 's the difference ? A rope is a rope . They waited for more , and , when it was n't said , Blakely went on . " A nigger , it was , accused of rapin ' a white girl . So we strung him up and shot him full of holes . I been thinkin ' on that many a time . " " Wrong man ? " " Puny reasons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buck up our cause  --  hell , she was a woman grown and an old whore to boot . Fuck anybody , black or white , for a price , and likely give him a dose in the bargain . See ? " " Yes ? " " Well , this nigger was kind of duded up , looked like he had the price , and I reckon she was drunk or anyhow lost her business sense , and she let him have it before collectin ' . But , clothes or no clothes , he was broke , and when he could n't pay she squawked to the sheriff , yellin ' rape , so we had an excuse to stretch his neck . " Blakely shook his head . " Excuse was all it was . It did n't take much there in them days . It turned out , though we never owned to it , that this nigger was a pretty well-turned young buck . Just a boy . " The memory made him sigh . " It 's been on my mind , I can tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , suh . " Hoffman had listened , not intently . It was as if the talk and the possibilities were remote from him , noise and shadows from another world . The slow afternoon passed . Twice , while Ben held the gun , Blakely brought food  --  boiled beans and ham , bread and butter , coffee and canned milk . The gun was unneeded , except perhaps once when Hoffman had to go outside to relieve himself . For the rest , he just sat , answering , if he answered at all , in monosyllables . Often his gaze went to the bottle , which was less than half full in the first place and had been drunk empty since . As darkness settled , Blakely said , " I can go with you . Act as guard if you want . " " No . I 'll just tie his hands again , and that 's probably a needless precaution . "  |p195It  was curious , he thought as he bound the man 's wrists , that they spoke of Hoffman as if he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence . But not so curious , either . Hoffman was n't there but in some dim region known , if it were known , to himself alone , a place of echoes and shades . He drove his car to the rear of the courthouse . No one was watching . No one could see in this darkness . The back door gave onto a hallway , and here was the sheriff 's inner office . He turned the knob and pushed Hoffman in . Brobeck sat at his desk , his big face drawn . His eyes , as he lifted them , showed the red rims of worry and work . He said , " What ! " and lurched to his feet . " I think you 'll want to question this man . " Brobeck 's quick gaze had taken them in , from the gash on Ben 's head to the tied hands of Hoffman . " So , " he said . " Him ? " " Your case now . " " And a fight , huh ? " Ben nodded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . " He went to Hoffman and untied his hands and set him down in a chair . He motioned Ben to sit and then sat himself . " Tell me , Ben . " Ben told him , and then Brobeck turned to Hoffman . " What'syour name ? Now , no playin ' dumb . What 's your name ? " " Harold Hoffman . " At least the man 's voice had grown clear . " Where from ? " " All around . " " Were you here yesterday , last night , in town ? " " I guess so . " " What do you mean , you guess so ? " " Seems so . " " I 'll call witnesses , if it comes to that . " Hoffman said , " Yeah , " not as a question . " What did you do here ? " " I left . " " Siirc you left . Left after what ? " " I forget . "  |p196Ben  said , " Give him a drink , Frank . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom drawer of his desk and got out a bottle and , after rummaging , three tin cups . Handinga cup to Hoffman , he said , " Here 's for your memory . " He gave Hoffman time to gulp and time to collect himself if he ever could . Then he asked , " What did you do here yesterday ? " " Loafed around , I guess . " " You 're always guessing . Do you remember killing a man , strangling a man with a wire ? Did you do that ? " Hoffman gave a faint shrug . Brobeck said , " Stand up . Turn out your pockets . Put the stuff on my desk . " From the pockets came nothing but a broken cigarette and five dollars and sixty-five cents in change . " God Almighty , " Brobeck said , mostly to himself . " For five dollars and sixty-five cents ! " He faced Hoffman again , " Where did you get it ? " " I forget . From somebody . " " From somebody dead . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's kind of hazy , I tell you . " " Not that hazy . " " It was whiskey . " " Did n't you know , when you killed and robbed the man , it was too late to buy whiskey ? " " I 've been drinking so long , I did n't give that a thought , not until afterwards . " " So you 're confessing . You did rob and kill a man ? " Hoffman 's head dropped . He said in a breaking voice , " It was me . It was whiskey and me . I did n't aim to kill him . It was whiskey did that . He died so easy . " " Yeah . A poor cripple you picked on . " Hoffman spread his hands on his face . His lungs filled and emptied . Through his fingers he mumbled , " Oh , God , keep this from my mother . " When his hands dropped , his eyes showed the glisten of tears.  |p197Brobeck  said , his words slow , " Jesus Christ , Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben answered . " Poor damn fool . Poor damn everybody . " " Do n't forget Billie Gayle . All right , I 'll get Skeeter in here to take down a confession . " " Frank , " Ben said , " you have to think about something more . " " What 's that ? " " The temper of the town . That 's why I brought him in after dark . " " A mob , a lynching , huh ? " " It would n't take much . " " I can hold ' em off . " " You might not . If we could get some dodgers distributed  --  " " You 're just thinkin ' out loud , or tryin ' to . " " I know now . Get the Boy Scouts . Get the postmaster . By early morning we can have dodgers on every doorstep , in every post office box . Not quite that , but enough . " Hoffman was n't paying them any attention , though he 'd quit crying . " And what you goin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll talk reason , that 's all . Make people think twice if I can . " " You 'll get ' em out , you and Okay Myers ? " " Myself . Not Myers . He 's the vigilante type . " " And you already been in a fight , spent a long day and look like a coroner 's case . " It 's important , Frank , damned important . Now , you 'll get intouch with the postmaster and whoever leads the Scouts now ? " " Yeah . Yeah . And meantime have a confession typed out . See you when ? " " Not more than three hours . " Ben went out the back way , found his car and drove to the office . He went directly to the Linotype , ignoring the typewriter , and thought how to begin and finally started working the keys , stopping often to find words most likely to cool passions . He had to handsetthe title and the improvised name of the source . But in thirtyp198minutes by the clock on the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours later had run off two thousand copies . He took them to the back door of the courthouse , noting as he drove that a gang of boys and a man or two had assembled out front . Doc Crabtree sat in the office with Brobeck . " Thought Doc ought to look at your head , " Brobeck said . " And your wife called . " " I forgot . " Brobeck smiled . " I told her her loved one would live . " It was n't meant as a dig , Ben realized . " Let me look at that head , " Doc Crabtree said . " Read this first . " Ben handed leaflets to both of them . Brobeck frowned as he read , then asked , " Who 's the Committee for Legal Justice ? " " I just appointed it . You and Doc Crabtree and I. " " And this here , where you say the prisoner could be got to only at the cost of my life ? " " Well ? " " Hell , Ben , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty vainglorious . What 's more , you do n't mention yourself in the deal . Not at all . " " The credit goes to the sheriff 's office . " " I 'm afraid the real firebrands wo n't be affected , " Doc Crabtree said , his old eyes lifting from the dodger . " I 'm ahead of you there , Doc , " Brobeck answered . " There 's Joe Burke , he 's a hothead , and Jim Sowder , who 's got a little bunch of ragtag disciples and himself is pretty easy fired up . So I called and enlisted them . They 'll help on twenty-four-hour guard duty . " Wolves in the fold , " Doc Crabtree said , smiling . " Now , Doc , do n't josh me . I 'll deputize them . They 'll take the oath . They promised , and whatever they are they wo n't go back on it . Simple . They just want to take part in the game , so I played choose-up and picked ' em for my side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it seemed to me that you boys with your good intentions might just stir up the pot . Not so ,  |p199though  . Not at all so . With your language , Ben , and your strategy , Frank , well , you 've aborted whatever might be . There 'll be no mob action . Hundred to one . " From the front of the hallway somebody shouted , " Ready , Sheriff . " Rising , Brobeck said , " Must be fifty , seventy-five kids out there besides Green and Montgomery , that new teacher , and Sandusky , all three Scout leaders or whatever you call it . " He picked up the bundle of dodgers . " The men have been layin ' out blocks for the kids to cover , and someone will be at the post office to stuff the boxes . " As he went out the door , he explained , " Got to make my pep talk . " Doc Crabtree creaked up , reached for his bag and came over to Ben . " Now for the noggin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No concussion 1 can detect , but you 'll need a stitch or two . " He cleaned the gash with alcohol , sprinkled it with some kind of powder and used his needle . Brobeck had returned by the time he was through . He said , " More deputies . Young and enthusiastic ones , too , all for law and order and the workin 's of court . There 'll be dodgers under almost every damn door in town before sunup . " " No more I can do , " Doc Crabtree said and picked up his bag . They both thanked him , and he gave a goodbye salute . Brobeck sat down again and reached for his bottle . " Time for a drink . Long past time . Prisoner locked in his cell with Skeeter on guard and his relief comin ' . Relax , Ben , and do n't think on your sins , which look like some of ' em might have caught up with you . " With his cup in his hand he went on , " We got him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only , Hoffman 's such a miserable bastard . Kind of upsets me , even when I call to mind Billie Gayle . I low come , Ben ? " " What ? " " I do n't feel any better but ought to . Got a right to . " Ben thought a minute , feeling too tired to think . " I guess youcould say that , after the first taste , all victories turn sour . " " Where 'd you pick that up ? "  | " It just came to me . " " Any more sayin 's like that pop into your head , spit ' em out . I like to have my notions harnessed . Anyhow , Ben , at least and at last we got a sure sure . " " A sure sure ? " " Hoffman 's guilty as hell , and he 'll hang . Not sure but sure sure , which we ai n't got enough of in this life . When can anybodybe dead certain of anything , any time , no matter when or not ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You might put it that every course of action is attended by un-certainty . " " Good , but make it haunted by uncertainty , ' and it comes out even better . " " All right . It does n't work , though , Frank . The hell with it . Ideas like that just make for timidity . And what use is the timid man ? Just a eunuch . " Brobeck sighed . " No balls at all , like some song goes . But it 's plain to me you think on two sides of your head . " Now Ben had to sigh . " I suppose . What I do know is that I'mdead sitting here on my tail . " He got up . " Good night , Frank . " Brobeck rose and put out his hand to be shaken . " Thanks , Ben . You know , goddamn it , had n't been for you  --  " " Good night . "  | " THERE WAS NO NEED for you to get up , " Ben said , watching Mary Jess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by tonight , or earlier . " " And you ? " she answered . " After some breakfast it will be tryingenough . Thank God , I do n't have to watch . " " I 'm hoping it wo n't take long . " He looked at his watch again . Three forty-five A. M. The outsidewindows were black with night . They cast back the kitchen lights , as if the surrounding darkness would not tolerate penetration . The kitchen was a snug brightness , not to be ventured away from . " I 'll think about something else , " he said as Mary Jess put a skillet on a burner . " I 'll try to . And you do , too . Get your mind off it . Think about the new building we 've put off too long . " " You 're talking just to divert us , Ben . " " Why not ? It 's a good subject . I want an office big enough for you and me and at least another full-time helper , not to mention callers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bump into one another . As it is , you do half your work at home . Of necessity . " That Frank Brobeck , " she said , ignoring him . " What 's wrong with the man ? " " I 've told you . People . What he thinks the electorate wants . What they think they want . " She shook her head and began separating slices of bacon . I Iis mind flitted back while he waited . He was in the sheriff 's office again , and in his hand was a printed and personally signed invitation to witness the execution of Harold Hoffman at betweenp202four and eight o'clock on the morning of August 29 . Brobeck sat behind his desk , a shuffle of papers before him . Skeeter Jerome occupied a chair near the door and was applying vaseline toward the end of a heavy coil of rope , at the very end of which was a loop and a huge knot , a hangman 's knot , Ben supposed . Ben held out the invitation . " Frank , how many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred . Why ? " " God , Frank ! " " Why again ? " " I wish you had talked to me . Or , better yet , Mr. Collingsworthor someone like that . " " Do n't tell me they do n't want the man hanged . " Ben , in the lighted kitchen , saw himself in the sheriff 's office shaking his head . He was saying ; " That 's not the point , Frank . They would n't want to make a spectacle of it , a carnival , a circus . " " That 's not the way I see it . Barrin ' death and accident , I bet every one of those I invited attends . And I sent cards just to responsible people . " Jerome interrupted to say , " Frank , look . This rope is getting to be slick as a greased pig . You wo n't have to worry it does n't slide in the knot . " His eyes returned to the rope , and he put on more vaseline , intent on his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Now see here , Ben , the law says fifteen witnesses got to be present . That takes in law men , preachers , reporters , doctors and members of the family , if any . Adds up to quite a little circus in itself , do n't it ? " " Not to two hundred . " " Ben , people elect me to do what they believe should be done . You wo n't hear ' em hollerin ' . Was I to say no to everyone except them that the law specifies , what then ? " " They think they want to see it . That 's as of now , just as of now . But I bet not a one of those you 've invited would spring the trap . You 'll have to pay for that , or do it yourself . " " Wrong again . I 've got volunteers , quite a bunch . I gave the job to one who said he wanted the honor of doin ' it . Clarence Rudey , it was . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . " Why make a fuss ? It 's got to be done . What difference if a lot or a few see him on the gallows ? Reminds me , Frank , that gallows we had to borrow from Deer Lodge should be here today . There was a call earlier . " Brobeck nodded . " Plenty of time . " How answer Jerome , an honest and competent deputy , whose careful work with the rope , Ben imagined , stemmed not from an eagerness to see Hoffman hanged but from the determination to get the job done and done right ? " I just do n't like it , " Ben said . " It wo n't make any difference to Hoffman , " Brobeck told him . " He just sits quiet . Nothin ' upsets him , not the Court of Appeals rulin ' against him or the governor refusin ' to butt in . Crowd or no crowd , he 'll stay calm . That what 's botherin ' you , Ben ? Because he just sits and takes easy what comes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gayle and damn near brained you ? Think the public ought n't to see how we treat such as him ? " Ben got up and said again , " I do n't like it . No use to say why . " " Then we got to differ , Ben . " A hanging look of regret showedon Brobeck 's big face . " No lastin ' matter , for God 's sake ? " " No , Frank . " Mary Jess brought him back to the kitchen , to the darkness waitingoutside , to the now and what was soon to be . " Bacon 's done . flow many hotcakes , Ben ? " " Just a couple . I 'm not hungry . " " Now , Ben . That 's not enough . " Her consideration , her solicitude , was not a new thing , he thought . It had always been there . It was new only in his tardy recognition of it , new in his guilty thanksgiving . Such loyalty overrode shortcomings , or ought to . And he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night , nearly a year ago now , when he had come home after delivering Hoffman to Brobeck and listening to his confession . Though it was late , she and her father had been waiting when he returned from the courthouse , spent and somehow depressed . They had been right here , in this kitchen , when he opened the brick door . Her eyes Hew wide , and a gasp came from her , andp204she was on her feet , running to him , before he could get the door closed . " Ben , you 're hurt ! " Her hands , her gentle hands , came to his forehead and cheek , and there was such a tenderness in her touch , such a fearful , unexpected concern in her eyes , that he was almost undone . He felt his mouth twist and his throat choke , and he turned his face down and away , seeking control . " It 's nothing much , " he managed to say . " Doc Crabtree took care of it . " " Your forehead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " Mr. Collingsworth said , " You caught him , eh , boy ? " Mary Jess put in , " Frank Brobeck said that you did . " " Single-handed , too , boy ? " " It was n't as much as you 're making of it . " " That 's as may be , " Mr. Collingsworth said . " When you feel up to it , we hope that you 'll tell us . " " Not now , Father . Not now . Ben , you look ready to drop . Do n't you want to lie down ? To sleep ? " " Not quite yet , Mary Jess . " She studied him and got up and went to the cupboard . " There 's a bottle here somewhere , " she said , moving boxes and sacks . " You bought it , Ben , once when we invited Mort Ewing to dinner . Here it is . " She took the bottle to the sink . " Tell me how you mix it . You 're going to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If anyone ever needed it , you do . " The rare smile that rested so well on Mr. Collingsworth 's sober face touched it now . " I do declare , as they say , " he said , " I do believe I 'll have one , too . " A year ago , Ben thought , while Mary Jess brought food to the table . Almost a year ago . A year fled , lived month by fast month if a man waited for death on a rope . And though the winter had hindered construction , the dam was growing and both town and county still growing with it . From thirty-five hundred to eightyfivehundred  --  that was the estimated increase in county numbers and probably not far from right . And there was bus ser/vice north and south from Arfive , and letters were being flown from big city to city , and roads were being paved , and on the local screen Greta Garbo and Harold Lloyd had appeared , and Will Rogers , too . And during the year an oil field had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being worked twenty-odd miles to the north of town , and in Europe those jackasses , Mussolini and Hitler , were kicking up dust that was none of America 's business , and Helena suffered an earthquake , and March and April had been very cold and a sheepherder had died in a blizzard . All were marks of the months , all noted in news columns , and all important enough to men not sentenced to die . Did Hoffman take heed of them ? Was outside life closed off from the inner life soon to end ? Sometimes , when he thought of Hoffman , Ben almost wished he had n't caught him . The man ought to hang , but what was the use ? A worthless life taken in pay for a good one ? Where was the gain unless in the unlikely event it saved other lives ? In that mood he made himself see Billie Gayle again , Billie the good , lying strangled , his birth-stricken face so tortured that a man sickenedon seeing it . Mary Jess broke in , saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's enough , and it was good . Thanks . Now it 's time to be going . Not long until dawn . " She came to him when he rose , and he kissed her . " Goodbye , " she said . " I 'm glad it 's business that takes you there , not mere curiosity . " " I 'd dodge it , but how would we look , not being represented when so many out-of-town newspapers are ? " " No argument . At least you 're one man who wo n't find satisfaction in going and seeing . " " Not much , anyhow . " He felt her eyes on him as he went out the door toward the car . Low on the eastern horizon the day gave faint promise of being horn . Labor pains . Twilight sleep . Another day delivered , anotherman dead . But darkness hugged the ground , intruded on here and there by lights in households that had risen early for thep206big event . When a man took a life , he sacrificed the right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parked his car in front of the office and walked toward the courthouse , seeing cars clustering around it and men getting out , hurrying , though the time was n't four o'clock yet . Be early and find places up front . He walked around the courthouse , exchanging greetings , to the squat jail behind it . Brobeck had had a canvas tunnel or chute erected from the back door of the jail across to the county machine shed where the gallows presumably stood . A street light shone on the surroundings and them , and lights beamed dimly from the poorly shaded windows of the machine shed . A slit about midway of the tunnel allowed entry . Chet George stood there , making sure those wanting inside had their invitations in hand . There was an increasing crowd outside , many strangers included . Visitingofficials , probably . Newspapermen . They began lining up , strangers , friends and acquaintances , and filing in . George was calling , " Better come in , folks . You do n't want a last-minute jam . Ben went through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office . Brobeck was on his feet , pacing . Skeeter Jerome was standing , too . Brobeck came to a stop on seeing Ben . " Waitin ' for a full house , " he said . He looked at the clock on the wall . " Then the sooner , the better . " Jerome said , " Forget the fidgets , Frank . Hell . All in a life-time . " " These goddamn sheriffs , ex-sheriffs , deputies and what not . They stormed the damn office , Ben . But Skeeter got names and titles for you , case you wanted them . I cleared ' em out just a minute ago . I can tell you there 's no law in Montana today , exceptby God here . " " We 're on the map , " Jerome said and sat down . " Is n't that what you 've always wanted Arfive to be , Ben ? On the map ? " When Ben did n't answer , Brobeck spoke . " Reverend Hystrand is with Hoffman now . What can he say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray for forgiveness , I suppose . " " And we 're all miserable goddamn sinners , anyhow , hell-houndp207because it took screwin ' to bring us into the world . Shit ! How 's the crowd , Ben ? " Jerome got up and went to the back window while Ben answered , " Gathering . Going inside . " " I 'll give ' em five , ten minutes more . " Brobeck was pacing again . From the window Jerome said , " Slash in the canvas that somebodycut . Gate crashers . " Brobeck went to look . " No reason to get lathered up , " Jerome reported . " County road boys are throwin ' ' ern out , and there 's the town marshal . " The door opened , and Brobeck turned and said , " Hi , Rudey . I was waitin ' . You know Ben Tate ? " " Sure . " Rudey advanced and shook hands . He was a short , stocky man with more of a belly than doctors approved . His face was broad but foreshortened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehension . " Rudey , " Brobeck told him , " there 's one thing I want you to be careful to do . " " What 's that ? " " Spring the trap quick , unexpected , while Hoffman is waitin ' for me to put the hood on him . " " Why in hell for ? " " So Hoffman wo n't know . To save him that last minute of tbinkin ' . Call it mercy , rememberin ' mercy ai n't so goddamn mercifulin a hangin ' , not at the best . " " That son of a bitch do n't deserve any mercy . I say let him suf-fer . " " Do n't matter what you think . Hear ! You spring that trap accordin ' to me if you want to have the honor of doin ' it . " " All right , Frank . I did n't set out to rile you . All right . Just like you say . " " You better get there then . " Rudey went out. ! irobcck said , " Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I doubt it lIolds ont . " " I wo n't try for it . "  | " Come on , Skeeter . ' Bout time to escort the bride to the altar . See you , Ben . " Ben walked away and went toward the slit in the tunnel . The crowd had increased , grouped back from the entry and ranked along the tunnel . Someone had raised a ladder to a window of the building , and two men were trying to stand toward the top of it . But these obviously were people without invitations . Ben made his way through them to the slitted door , where Chet George waved him in . For lack of chairs men stood inside , jammed toward the gallows that stood waiting its customer . The men smoked and talked and looked toward the mouth of the tunnel , and smoke layered the air , drifting like clouds under the stingy beams of lights in the ceiling . Soon they would quit talking , quit smoking , quit moving , all energy centralized in their eyes . Ben edged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said and had to smile at what he was about to say next . " What brings you here ? " " Not such a fool question , " Ewing answered . " I do n't know . It was n't really that I wanted to be in at the kill . Dingbats have been strung up before and me not there and no use if I was . You could say , I reckon , that Billie Gayle brought me here . Not much sense in that , either . " " I have some reason , " Ben said and felt of the copy paper in his pocket . " Yeah , but both of us got better ones . We 're human beings . I reckon that 's the curse of it . You take animals , they 'd be long gone , unless it was mother and cub . " " No mother present , " Ben said , passing time . " Hoffman did n't want her to know , but I hear she got word of it . " " Not a damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallelujah . " Ewing shrugged . " A man dies alone anyhow . " The gallows and platform seemed to rise tall . But Brobeck had said a drop equal to a man 's height was enough to break his neck if the knot was tied right , add just a few inches for safety 's sake . So the thing was n't so tall . A man standing under it , arms raised ,  |p209could  touch the platform . It and the scaffolding over it just appeared to be high , beyond reach , as remote and as near as the doom restless men dreamed about . Quiet crept on the crowd , and eyes turned toward the mouth of the tunnel . Out came Hoffman with Brobeck on one side of him and Jerome on the other . Hoffman 's hands were tied together . They walked smartly , Hoffman without urging , as if for inspection . Someone said in a soft hiss , " There 's the pisshawk . " The three climbed the thirteen steps . " No help needed , thank you , " Hoffman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moved to it . Brobeck adjusted the noose while Jerome strapped the man 's legs . Ben could n't see Rudey . He made note of the time . Brobeck stepped back . " Mr. Hoffman , " he said , " does the condemnedman have a final word to speak before the sentence of the court is complied with ? " The man 's face might have moved , but no words came out . " You want to say anything ? You got something to say ? Last chance if you do . " Strain , that was what Brobeck was showing . Hoffman stood silent , stood composed , his dull face impassive . Only his eyes turned , and his head appeared to incline toward it as 13robeck raised the black hood . The trap fell open , and Hoffman plunged through . A man might imagine he heard the crack of the neck bone as the body yanked to a stop . He could see the head canted and the limbs writhing and jerking in protest against this ultimate violation of being . The writhing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to nothing . The tongue had protruded . Doc Crabtree and young Dr. Roberts went forward and used their instruments . After a while they pronounced Hoffman dead . ' I'hc time was eight minutes from drop to dissolution . Lawrence Chiles stood ready to cart off the body . He was always ready for death . Outside , a red dawn was streaking the sky . A new day wasborn.  |p210THE  OFFICE seemed to crowd in on him . It was too small . It was disordered , no matter the pains taken to keep it tidy . There was the pile of exchange papers , catalogues , unread copies of Editor &; Publisher , statement blanks , letters under paperweights that went unfiled for lack of space in file cases . Here was a typewriter , there another , both on stands beside copy paper , notes , and starts on editorials . Actually , Ben thought , the place had n't changed much since the old days of Macalester Cleveland . The town had grown , the paper had flourished , but the plant had n't kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was closed , the thump of a job press in the shop and the chatter of the Linotype accompanied conversation in the office . He had grown accustomed to crowding and clutter . It was only on occasion that he was acutely aware of them , occasions like this one with Jerry Stoneman occupying the one extra chair . Stoneman'scalm gaze went from object to object , but if there was anythingcritical in his assessment , the fact did n't show on his face . But Ben said , " You 're thinking we 've outgrown the place , and you 're right . The town has topped us . " " Oh , " Stoneman answered . " That 's interesting . " From a pocket he took a package of cigarettes , offered one to Ben and lit up . Ben found an ashtray under some papers . Stoneman always dressed more or less cowpuncher fashion  --  boots , frontier pants , close-fitting shirt and short-waisted jacket . On his knee rested a stockman 's Stetson . A working ranch hand might have faulted him for being over-immaculate if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowboy talk . He could walk like a cowboy . " I just happened in to say hello , " he said . " Good weather for driving . " Through the dusted window Ben could see trucks and cars passing . There was some foot traffic , though his office and shop were located at the head of the street and on the east and wrong side of it . As always these days , dust rose and rolled and sank and rose again . " We 're going to pave the streets , Main Street first , " Ben said . He was just making conversation . He was just waiting . " That 's good . You have an up-and-coming town . " Ben drew on his cigarette . " You 're thinking of expanding , then ? " Stoneman 's tone was the tone of casual interest . He had opened the subject himself , Ben thought , opened it because of suspected if unrevealed criticism , and now Stoneman had returned to it . " You 've heard , then , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to build a new and adequate building . I 've bought a lot and drawn plans . " " Sounds fine . " " It will be . Right now I have three men in the shop and a devil to boot , and room just for two . Two extras , one just part-time , on the news staff . It 's thick in here when we get together . " " Mrs. Tate ? " Stoneman lifted an eyebrow . " She often works at the house . She 's there today . " " I see . " " There 'll be no more of that , not in my new place . " " I imagine it will mean quite an outlay ? " " I have it figured . " Stoneman stubbed his cigarette carefully . Not a fleck of ash escapedthe tray . " I ca n't say for sure , Ben , but I have an idea we would be willing to help with the financing . That , at least , is a possibility . " So there was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baited and dangled . Ben said , " Thanks , but no. "  | " Oh , it was n't an offer . Just a suggestion . " " Thanks again . I 'm all set for the money . " " We like to help . That 's all . Help communities , help independententerprises like yours . " " But you would n't let me be independent , not the interests you represent . Besides , you own and control enough papers . All the dailies , almost . " " Say it 's so , is it so bad , Ben ? We stand , we 've always stood , for the welfare of Montana . Where would the state be without us ? No progress . Empty acres . " Stoneman drew another slow cigarettefrom the pack and set a match to it . He was careful to put the dead match in the tray . " Your we ' means copper and power , one or the other or both . The twins . Am I right ? " " Does that matter ? " Stoneman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our interests often coincide , to be sure , but they never are adverse to the interests of the state . " " I could argue that point . " " But let 's not argue , Ben . " Stoneman smiled a neat smile . " Let it ride . You have the financing , you say , so you have no need of us . If I were you , I 'd make sure though , before closing the door . " He thrust out his hand . It was firm and assured . " Goodbye for now . " Stoneman put on his clean hat with care , at an angle just short of jaunty , and let himself out . He left a threat enclosed in the office . It circled and waved and focused , made sharp by his words . Make sure . Do n't close the door . " Goodbye for now . " It had been a long time , yes , months , since Stanton Rivers had given assurance of support from the bank , of a loan to help erect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before that he grant it . The paper was even more prosperous . A look at the books would prove that . So make sure as suggested . See Rivers . And now . There was a deposit to make anyhow . Ben stepped to the shop , asked Okay Myers to watch out for visitorsand then gathered up checks and cash and the slip and tookp213his hat . At the door he met Peter Sears ' teenager , who covered high-school events . " I 'll be back before long , Pete , " he told him . Stanton Rivers sat erect behind his barricade and nodded withoutsmiling . The trim mustache on his dark face seemed to signifyprudent management . " I 'd like to talk to you , " Ben said . Rivers nodded again . " If you 'll wait just a minute . " Ben went to a window , made his deposit and returned . Rivers said , " Come in . " He indicated a chair . Ben sat down . " It 's about the new building . I 'm ready to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I mean . " Rivers ' hands fiddled with a pencil , newly sharpened . His eyes were on it . " I remember , " he said . " That was some time ago , though . " " And my business is better than ever . I can show you the books . " " Your business . " Rivers sighed a sigh that seemed to breathe regret . " I must tell you , Ben , that the needs of the community have been almost too much for us . " Ben made himself smile . " Do n't tell me you 're broke . " Rivers raised a quick , protesting hand , as if Ben 's words might cause a run on the bank . " Heavens , no ! I meant we 're ex-tended . " " Overextended ? " " Extended as far as good banking practice allows . That and no more and no less than that . " " Which , no more and no less , means you 're saying no to me ? " " Only because of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been sad . They were unyielding . " I 'm damn sorry . " " So am I. " Ben quit his chair . " Disappointed in you , Rivers . I thought your word was good . " " Circumstances  --  " Ben did n't wait for the rest . Outside the bank , he almost collidedwith Mort Ewing . " Hey , " Ewing said . " Whoa , now . Easy , boy . "  | " Sorry , Mort . " " Here . " Ewing took his arm and moved to the side of the building . " Rest your butt on the window ledge . You ever heard that confession 's good for the soul ? " " My soul 's all right . It 's my business . " " So ? " " The bank just shut me off . No new building , I guess . " " Say it again . " " It 's tied up with Butte . Jerry Stoneman 's in town . Two and two . " Makes four , easy . So Stoneman saw Rivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That seems to be it . " Ewing 's hand went to his jaw and massaged it . " I do think I 'll have a talk with that dude . " " Who ? " " Rivers . Rivers ought n't to dry up like that , not without someone'sthrown in a dam . " " Do n't speak for me , Mort . Do n't act on my account . It 's not your business . " " It 's Rivers I 'm thinkin ' of , not you . A good sermon might save that son of a bitch of a sinner . Be on my conscience if I did n't try . Missionary spirit I got . But , first , come have a drink with me . " Thanks , no , Mort . You have a drink , and you 'll think better of it . A man has to hoe his own row . " " Needs tools regardless . But so long , Ben . Me for a soothin ' cup.  |p215EWING  MOVED as if to enter the Arfive House , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tate had gone on , then walked back to the bank . Ile told Rivers , who sat smiling beyond his little fence , " Want to jaw with you . " " Come in , Mort . " Rivers put out his hand , as if they had n't seen each other since Lewis and Clark traipsed over the mountains . " Not here . Private . In your priest 's hole . " " Surely . " Rivers rose , his smile grown uncertain , motioned Ewing inside and led the way behind the cages to his office in the rear , where he waved toward a chair . " All right , Mort . Open for business . " " I 'm makin ' some business mine . Somebody else 's . " " Whatever you want to take up , Mort . " " I just got it out of Ben Tate that you said no deal on a loan . " " Since he told you himself , I can confirm it without impropriety . I had to refuse him . I regret that . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your piccolo is playing what sounds like horseshit to me . " Rivers would n't get mad . He could n't afford to . He said , " Now , Mort , you 're being extreme . Let me explain . " " Explain away . " " You know things are uncertain , Mort . Here 's Roosevelt fiddlingwith the dollar , until we do n't know from one day to the next what it 's worth . He 's throwing out money as if it came free , money the nation can not afford . Look at all the handouts . Think about taxes . He has no business sense , that man , and sop216banks face uncertainties and difficulties . We do n't know what to expect except trouble . " " Yeah . And bankers know , do n't they ? They went broke , knowin ' so much , and it took a dumb feller that do n't know his ass from an asset to save ' em . " " Oh , come on , Mort . " " Nape . I 'm goin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There ought to be a law that you smart moneymen post a big picture of Roosevelt in the lobby and fall down on your goddamn knees and give thanks every morning and on the half-hour every day . It was him saved your hides . " " We would have saved our own if Hoover and his advisers had been left alone . " " Sweet crucified Jesus ! " " It 's true , Mort . " Rivers gestured with a thin , pleading hand . " You know I would n't low-rate you , but you 've been an outsider . You 've not been involved as many of us have . You could afford to sit on the sidelines . Twice in twenty years you 've had the luck to sell off your livestock before hard times hit us . " " Have it your way . Luck . Take this last time . It was just lucky I read about the Hawley-Smoot tariff that some of you wise men was so hell-bent for . It was just lucky I heard that London kicked back at us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York stock market , meantime and all along , was on its jubileespree , the booze bein ' supplied by you banker boys . Pure luck it was that it come to my notice . " " That 's hindsight , Mort . " " Lucky I sold out when there was nothin ' behind me to see . But get back to the subject , Rivers . Tate . Ben Tate and a loan you said no to . " " I 've given the reason . " Rivers ' finger went to his mustache . " Have you , now ? Here 's an honest man with a goin ' business . Damn little risk . None , you might say . And you turn him down . " " If you could see the total we have out on loan  --  " " No . No . We 'll kind of round up the past so 's to make it freshp217in your mind . One bank went bust in this town , like you know . Like you know , yours could have , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you did with the other depositors . Grateful you did n't close out your own account . " " For my own self , bad judgment . For the town and county , worth a gamble . That 's the short and the long of it . " " Nevertheless , I 'm grateful . " " Not grateful enough to help finance Ben Tate ? " Rivers leaned forward . Both hands came out , as if he carried a bowl to be filled . " Mort , please , you have to remember that we 're a member bank . " " Mumbo jumbo , member bank . " " Seriously , we ca n't be altogether independent , oblivious of others . " " My bank would be . " " What are you saying ? " " Nothing , but I reckon another bank would n't hurt . An independentone . " " You 're joking , of course . " " Sure thing . Now about that independence or shortage of same . Somebody , some mouthpiece , gave you the word . It do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who . " " I 'm telling you the truth about our being extended . " " Maybe so . Maybe . You know , Rivers , here in the cow countieswe 've kind of gone along with the big interests . They had their business , and we had ours , and no conflict that 's what we thought . But I wonder how it would be if it got out that the interestswere callin ' the shots right here in Arfive . Dumb we may be , hut by God not flunkies to fat asses . Get out , leave us alone , fuck the bank ' Ca n't you hear the call loud and clear when people learn about Tate ? " Ewing got up . " You 're threatening me , " Rivers said , rising slowly . " Damn right I am . Let people know , that 's my plank . Close H1y account and say do the same to my friends . New bank if it conics to that . Independence . "  | " Blackmail almost , " Rivers said . His voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price is a little goddamn spunk in you and a loan to Ben Tate . No usury . " He heard Rivers sigh as he went out . He reckoned he 'd done pretty good.  |p219YOUNG  PETE had gone from the office when Ben returned to it , and Mary Jess was n't about . The door to the shop was half-open , left that way so that callers would feel free to enter if no one was outside to greet them . But Jerry Stoneman occupied the extra chair . It was as if he never had left it . His hat rested on his knee , he had a cigarette in his hand and had moved the ashtray within easy reach . " Back again , " he told Ben and deposited a bit of cigarette ash . " So I see . " " I thought perhaps we ought to talk some more  --  that is , if you feel like it . " Here was the man , here the representative of the interests , who had told the bank what to do , what not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ben sank into his chair . Why no hot anger , then ? Why no denunciation ? Because Stoneman was only a tool , a seductive tool , and all men were tools , of desire and money and circumstance ? " Same subject as before , I suppose , " Ben said . " The same suggestion , at least . " " And more appealing , you think , now that you 've put the brakes on the bank ? " Stoneman took time in seeing that his cigarette was extinguished . His hand waved the bank aside . " To quote you , Ben , the town has topped you . " " That 's accurate enough . To keep up , I need not only a bigger building but new and added equipment . No secret there . " " With adequate facilities you could be putting out a semiweekly . There 's business enough , is n't there ? "  | " I 've thought about it . " " As it is , you 're inviting competition . " " Yours , you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Anybody 's . " With deliberation Stoneman offered Ben a cigarette and lit one himself . " Hell , Ben , business abhors a vacuum . Look the facts in the face . A newcomer , seeing opportunity here , would cut into , your advertising and just could underbid you on the county printing . " " If it was willing to suffer the losses . " " Its backers might be , in the beginning , at least . " " Jerry , cut out the hints . Cut out the veiled language . We 're not government diplomats . I know the whos , whats and whys . " Stoneman smiled . " Yes , I suppose . " He drew on his cigarette . " I 'm your friend , Ben , whatever you think . " " It would be nice to be able to believe so . " " I said we would see to the financing . That 's certainly friendly . " Stoneman leaned forward and used his cigarette as a pointer . " What 's more , we would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case could n't be made . A good case . We 're not fools , or rascals , either . " Ben had to smile in return . " Just greedy . " " Just as you do , Ben , we like profits . If there 's something wrong with that , there 's something wrong with America . Maybe Russia has a better idea , huh ? " " Do n't be a fool , Jerry . Only fools throw in that communist business when a man disagrees with them . " Take the pot , Ben . You 're right . I know better than to tag you that way . " " To go on , then . What would you expect if I accepted your help ? What positions would you demand ? " Stoneman 's hands went out as if in exasperation . " No demands , Ben . Christ sake ! Just understanding . Just considered sympathy . Just a kind of fellow-feeling , with allowances for some differences , if it came to that . Just a matter of using your head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplify , simplify , simplify . "  | " I 've been to college , too , " Stoneman replied , smiling again as he attended to his cigarette . " Let 's take the duck pond first or , as your paper refers to it , the great dam on the Breast . " " What about it ? " " It 's needless , Ben . It 's make-work . No logic supports it . Flood control , hah ! " " But still better than starvation and revolution . " " It would never have come to that if the natural forces of economicshad been allowed to operate . " " That 's an unsupported opinion . Anyhow , there 'll be irrigation later . I suppose you call that unproductive ? " " Irrigation maybe . But what will surely come about , unless people are alerted , is the generation of power . " Stoneman leaned forward and jammed his cigarette out . " Public power , Ben . Socialism . Mussel Shoals , the Tennessee Valley , socialistic as hell . Foreign to American tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your side has always argued for private enterprise , which impliescompetition , though you hardly dare say so . Competition might be a good thing . " " You miss the point . Competition , yes , or monopoly if necessaryand controlled . But not government competition , for God 's sake . What individual industry , what associations of industry , can stand against the powers of the government ? The massed powers ? The bureaucratic powers ? Hell , man , it 's David against Goliath with David losing . His little slingshot against all the artillery ! The only hope for him is the people , an informed people , Ben , a people made wise . " Stoneman straightened as if for breath , his position expounded and standing invulnerable . " We would hope , " he went on , quietly now , " that you would take a firm stand against public power . " Hope ? " " You asked for simplicities . That 's one . " Stoneman paused to pass cigarettes . When he had his own going , his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had.  | " One simplicity , " Ben said . " Name some more . " " A more general one , then , " Stoneman answered , his head raised to the plume of smoke he blew out . " It concerns your Mr. Roosevelt . " The name seemed to put a bad taste in his mouth . " Mine ? " " Oh , not yours alone but yours nevertheless . Last year you promoted a big birthday celebration for him . A grand march , a dance , a great birthday cake , a public listening to his radio talk . " " As if we , the town , were n't part of a national celebration ! " " We could do with less adoration of Roosevelt . " " Next item . " " Yes , " Stoneman said . " Right in your own backyard now . " He paused as if waiting for a question and then went on . " Brobeck . Your friend , Frank Brobeck . He has political ambitions . " " Is it so wildly ambitious to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he would n't stop there . " " Who can tell ? Anyhow , he 's as good as elected . Your man , Kilmer , will run a poor second . " " As matters stand , yes , thanks in large part to you and your paper . I said , as matters stand now . They can change . They can be changed . ' ' " I 'm listening . " " Let me tell you a little story , Ben . " The smile played on Stoneman 's face . " Do you know how Joe Dixon was defeated for re-election as governor back in the twenties ? What helped beat him ? " " That was just before my time here . I know your people opposedhim . But tell me what . " " A golden gravy boat . A little damn gold gravy boat . He used it on the family table . It cost him votes . " " As a mark of the spoils of office , I suppose . " " Sure . And it was n't golden at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the opposition found out about it and made it gold . Alchemists , they were , as well as smart politicians . They harped on it . " " You mean you did . The big interests . "  | " Personally I ca n't claim any credit . But once the story was out and repeated enough , no denials , no protests , worked . Gold it was , then , now , and forever . Amen . " " The story somehow applies to Brobeck , huh ? " " Not precisely , Ben . Not precisely . It was just meant as a word to the wise . He has n't been elected yet . " " He will be . " " Remember the slip between the cup and the lip . There 's time to go before the election , plenty of time for posters and pamphlets and letters to voters . Then we would hope that you would lie low , saying nothing either way in your editorial columns . " " It would have to be for a better reason than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fake gravy boat ? " " No fake this time . We would , or will , address ourselves to the fundamental decency of the people . " The word " decency " seemed to hang in the air , unattended and orphaned or beset by what had been spoken and what was to be . It mixed with the outland sounds from the shop , unnoticed till now . Ben said , " The boat ? " " The boat would be Bloody Brobeck , the man who loved hanging , loved it so much that he made a public ceremony of stretchinga neck . Revulsion , that 's what good people will feel . And the people not invited to this glorious spectacle will be quick to agree Brobeck is brutal . " " Invited or not , people were all for the hanging . " " They were . They were . Past tense . Do they feel so good about it now ? Will they when they read about how bloodymindedhe proved himself ? Why do you think all hands at the hanging climbed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To drown their guilt , you would say . " " Would n't you ? " " I was n't there . " A man should be able to think of a stronger answer than that , but any defense was weak . Here was shaky round , there a shameful proceeding ; yet , exaggerated as circum/stance and person might be , the political threat to Brobeck seemed small . " That 's a frail boat , " Ben said . " It wo n't go far from shore . " " I wish you 'd be reasonable , Ben . As your friend I wish it . " " You could shut up . " " No , " Stoneman said slowly . His gaze fixed on Ben . His face seemed to harden . " You and Brobeck compose quite a team . Ca n't you see it , Bloody Brobeck and the brave editor , who ran from a bear and left a friend to be killed though he carried a rifle ? " Hold tight , Ben told himself . Hold tight . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How would you prove it ? " " Get it straight ! I 'm for Brobeck . He would say stick your goddamnloan up your ass , and that 's what I say . Goodbye . " " Not quite yet , my friend . " Stoneman 's face drew itself to a point . His eyes bored at Ben . A shine came to light in them . He said evenly , " There 's the small matter of a chippie , name of Beulah Sanders . We have your note to her . " Ben kept still . " Girls get confidential , girls in bed do , even girls who administeremergency relief , which seems to be what you got . Right ? We get it in Butte now . " Ben did n't answer . " I do n't think you 'd want those things whispered about . So , Ben , the loan  --  " Ben went to the door and flung it open , ignoring what else was to be said . He came back and caught Stoneman by the collar and yanked him upright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Stoneman 's clean hat was on the floor . He threw it out , too . Stoneman had fallen . He came to his feet and brushed off his knees and elbows , taking his time . He said , " Too bad , Ben , " and , hat carefully placed on his head , started down the street . From across it Pinkie Adams was watching . Soon the whole town would have wind of a fight . Ben closed the door and turning , saw Mary Jess at the entrance to the shop . " So you know , " he said . " Eavesdropping . "  | " That 's just what Father would have done , " she said in a strange voice . " Yes , I heard . You were busy . I came in the back way . I saw you throw him out . " " The Advocate along with him , I guess . " Now he saw a glow in her eyes not seen before . To his astonishmentshe said , " To hell with the newspaper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He would have construed the comparison as criticism , but her arm came up and went round his shoulder , and she kissed him . He was n't sure whether hug and kiss were maternal and protectiveor admiring and wifely . It seemed not to matter much.  | " IT 'S A GLORIOUS DAY , MORT , " Julie said . " No argument . But someone wrote about the hounds of spring bein ' on winter 's traces . Me , right now I think about the hounds of winter on autumn 's traces . " " There 's no reason we ca n't go to Arizona or California for the winter . " Her tone was teasing . Not looking at him , she kept tooling the car along a dirt-and-gravel road . Westward , from up here on the far bench , Ewing could see the mountains and Elephant Ear Butte standing clean and clear , defiantof time . It was a crazy notion that the spirit of Prof Collingsworth , who so often had gazed at the butte , might have penetrated and personalized rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No flabby climate for me . " " Tough guy , " she said , still teasing . " A soft winter might aid your convalescence . " " So might a good freeze . Anyhow , woman , I 'm already healed up . She did n't answer . She just drove along , her eyes fixed on the road 's bumps and turnings , her hands quick on the wheel . For something to say , something true if not new to him , he said , " You 're awful pretty . " One hand left the wheel and squeezed his . " You wo n't wear your glasses , " she said . But he saw well enough  --  the clean , gentle lines of her face , the trim lines of her figure . Thank God she had n't grown roundshoulderedand busty , the way most women did , given time.  | " Shall I turn around when I can ? " she asked . " I do n't want you to get tired . " " As if I could n't even ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I tell you that horse did n't spill me . I tell you again he slipped and fell on the sidehill . " " I know . " She was thinking , he knew , about the time he had barely crippledinto the ranch house after the horse had rolled over him . She had hustled him to Doc Crabtree , and Doc Crabtree had hustled him into Great Falls . Ruptured spleen , broken ribs and assorted botherations , they had said there . When he did n't heal right after they 'd carved on him , Julie had got him onto a damn airship , and together they 'd torn off to the Mayo Clinic . But they 'd been back in Arfive for a month and more now . He was as good as new , or almost . They rolled through irrigation country , made possible by the dam on the Breast . Houses had gone up , small mostly , just as the holdings were small , kept that way by government restrictions on land ownership . Shrubs and trees , with caragana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing alongside the households . The fields had been harvested and lay bare or stubbled . Here and there little bunches of dairy cows stood listless or nosed at the ground , in any case looking sad . A hand-to-mouth living , these farmers had . Some day the damn government would find that the western grower could n't make out with a postage stamp for a farm . A cock pheasant , decked out like a big and gaudy trout fly , ran up the road and took wing , and a shot sounded from the bushes alongside a fence row , and the bird cumpled and fell . A man appearedfrom the bushes , shotgun in hand , and hurried to get it . " That 's Dee Berger , " Ewing said . " Slow down and pull up . " " The scientific farmer ? " " That 's him . " Berger had the dead cock in his hand by the time Julie brought the car to a stop . Ewing got out . " Clean shot , Dee , " he said.  | " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Mort ? " " Good . Fair to fine , anyhow . " They stood at the side of the car . Berger , Ewing thought , wore the look of toil . A short man and stringy , he had a face that a lot of weather had looked at . He carried his head bent , as if , when he was n't studying soil , he was studying books . " Looks like you 're making out all right yourself , " Ewing said . " Work and worry , that 's my dish . " " Worry ? " " This soil 's getting boggy . Too much water and no run-off . We 've got to have drainage ditches and soon . " " Not too surprisin ' , is it ? They had to drain-ditch that Medicinecountry . " " It was to be expected , all right , but that 's not all of it , Mort . " Ewing waited . Berger was a man who considered his words before letting them out . " You know I do a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact it pays better than irrigation , though you ca n't diversify much . " " You 're talkin ' to an ignorant hay hand . " Berger smiled , " I know how ignorant you are . " " I doubt it . " Berger drew a breath and waited and spoke . " Did it ever occur to you that summer-fallowing is a sort of irrigation ? " " Nope . Not exactly . " " It is , though . Why let half your acreage lie fallow for the next season ? Why root out every thirsty weed ? Why keep the surface soil scratched fine ? " " I might make a guess . " " Sure . To preserve moisture . " Berger hitched the shotgun that one arm held . With the other hand he made little swings with the bird . " That 's close to irrigation . I 'm not sure how much land and what kind of land can tolerate that much water . The mineral salts underneath come to the surface . No crop will grow on it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Any evidence ? " " Some . You 'll see a little , not much , even on irrigated land with drainage ditches . But it 's on dry , summer-fallowed acres you see it most . Not a great deal yet , but I 'm afraid there 'll be more . We 're just catching on to it . " " It 's something to think about , I reckon . Long term , though . Do n't let it pester you into the boneyard . Leave the torment to hell . It 's got a corner on it . " The eyes of Berger 's down-turned face rose , and a little smile came on and was gone . " All right . " Berger moved the shotgun again . " Wo n't you and Mrs. Ewing come eat with us ? " " Thanks , no . We 'll roll along . " They said goodbye . Berger looked at Julie , touched his hat and turned away , worry still seeming to ride him . Julie steered the car round a curve and down into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , and some were skittering loose , waving goodbye as the breeze gentled them down . Long since , the grass had turned tan , cured on the stem . Standing hay , it would make good winter graze at the ranch . She came to a stop in front of the apartment they leased . " You 're going to eat now , " she said . " I 'll see to it you eat well . " " Heil Hitler . " It took her just a few moments to make sandwiches and to pour a glass of milk that he would have put down the drain if she had n't been watching . After he 'd eaten , he said , rising , " I got to see the town 's running all right . " " A nap first . " " No damn nap . Now , Julie , hell . " He went to the door , where her voice stopped him . " Your cane , Mort . " Oh , God 's sake ! " She was smiling , his cane in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you remember what you said first , right after you 'd come out from under the anesthetic ? " " Some fool thing . "  | " You said to me , You did n't think I was going to leave my girl , did you ? ' " " That was the simple , by-God truth . " " It 's the simple , by-God truth she 's not going to let you . " She put the cane in his hand and kissed him . The cane made a man feel like a cripple , an old codger whose pins had played out . Next stop , the rest home . Next thing , the loss of his mind like Prof. Collingsworth before finally he croaked . Some people said he 'd worn out his brain just by thinking . He might have preserved it with some moderate drinking . He swung the cane as he walked . Damn if he 'd use it as if his steps were uncertain . Coming up from the side street that led to the Methodist church , a bunch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits and old boobs and bound butts . If you made a pass at one , she 'd simper or call the town marshal to prove she still had allure . He knew most of them but acted as if they escapednotice . Greeted by call or signal , one or more of them would want to tell him about the new preacher . Fall days , he thought . Fall of 1945 , end of the war , and things were settling back as near normal as ever they 'd be . At the ranch cattle would be grazing , peaceful under a kind sun , watched by young Mort , who would be helped by his wife and helped or hinderedby his two kids . And here , for his health 's sake , he lived in an apartment , boxed in like a steer in a squeeze , safe , Julie would say , from the temptation of work . What did a man out of work do ? What did a man out of work in town do ? He ate breakfast and read the Great Falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and there was the rest of the day lying blank unless he could bring himself to listen to the damn radio , unless he had a good book , which he did n't . The Egg and I was the latest he 'd read , and it was pretty mild fodder . He went by Stan Rivers ' bank . A couple of grandpas had their bent backs against it , waiting for someone to jaw with . To them he said , " Hi , got some business , " and left them looking deprived . Ike dropped in at the Maverick Bar . They were the entertainmentnow , the almost only entertainment , these bars and loungesp234that in franker days had been known as saloons . Every damn one of them had a music box in it , and some knucklehead was always feeding it coins , foreclosing all but yelled conversation . But except for old Ruby Yont , who foreclosed conversation with her own jabber , the place was empty , barring Elmer Barns who drank a quart of his own goods every day when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Too much of his intake had gone to his belly and liver . " Brandy , as usual ? " he asked . Ewing nodded . " Have one yourself . " " How about me ? " Ruby asked , gazing up with pouched eyes . Under her fingers were some loose coins . " You of son of a bitch . Got plenty of money . " " Give her a drink . " She left her stool , coin in hand , and faced toward the juke box . " We 'll have a little music to go with it . " " No damn din , " Ewing said . " Choose up . Din or drink ? " She got back on her stool . " I just wanted to hear Do n't Sit under the Apple Tree , ' but all right . I like a man with no bullshit about him . " Ewing took his gaze away from her . She was like a lot of shestuffthese days , moochers and spenders , young and old , some of them living on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was n't so long ago that a saloon was a man 's place . It was n't so long ago that even the roughest cowpunchers watched their language in the presence of ladies . Now talk was likely to be unrestrained , and even the women customers with clean mouths seemed not to be fazed by coarse talk . He drank his brandy and went out . He used to while away time playing solo , but who knew the game now ? Men played pitch or cribbage or sometimes poker , none of them calling for the card savvy that solo did . Milt Dearborn was taking the sun in front of his new-car salesroom , which stood vacant except for an antique number that had been spruced up and might run for a mile or two . Dearborn said , " Hi , Mort . How 's the invalid ? "  | " In bed . Ca n't you see ? " " I see . Say , Mort , you 'd better sign up for a new car . That old buggy of yours is n't long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in , you said you 'd got it fixed good as new . " " So I did , but there 's just so much a mechanic can do . The new models will be rolling before you know it , and I could kind of juggle you up on the list . It 's longer already than the telephone book . " " Forget it . I got a feeling them new models will be made out of tinfoil . Anyhow , why you pushin ' ? You made out fine , sellin ' old cars and tinkerin ' with buggies like mine . " Dearborn smiled a fat smile . " Times change , " he said . " That 's a new thought . " Ewing eased up the street . The town had toned down since the big dam was built . It was smaller than it had been at its peak , biggerthan it had been before it . No heavy machinery growled along now . No work crews jammed the place . Burtville and such outlyingjoints were vacant and ramshackle and looted of usable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust . A goodenoughplace . A kind of prosperous place . But not everything was for the better , he thought , walking along . Arfive did n't have a men 's store anymore , not a good one . It did n't have a general mercantile company , where a man could buy anything from pickles to pants and a few yards of dry goods to take home along with a cheese wedge . And if the county had been helped , it had been hurt , too . For the war effort , for the benefits offered by government , too much good grazing land had been torn up to grow scanty crops , marginal land that native grasses would never return to . It would sprout tumbleweeds and Russian thistle and such . He came to the Arfive House , where Jim Sowder was cultivating a good case of cirrhosis . It was too early for much in the way of trade . A stranger was nursing a hangover with a beer . In a corner a machine as big as a shed , lit up like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice with . Ewing pointed to it and said , " That 'll tickle the customers deef. "  |p236Sowder  put out a fresh beer for the customer , made change and answered , " Newest thing . It 's what people want . " " Not this people . Long as it 's silent , give me a brandy . " He was sipping at the shot glass when Earl Kilmer came in . Kilmer gave a bobtailed hello and ordered straight gin . Centered in him was a pot as shaped as a prize Halloween pumpkin . It did n't like the belt that tried to surround it . Kilmer would have one drink here , one at the Maverick , one at the Broken Horn , and make the round again , thus convincing himself that people would think he did n't drink much . That had n't worked with his wife . She had left him . Like men who might have been important but had grown unimportant , Kilmer talked importantly . " Well , Mr. Mort Ewing , " he said , " how do your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House ? " Ewing gulped his drink , answered , " I shut off the faucet , " and let himself out . He passed a strange boy who walked with a limp , maybe given him by enemy fire . The return to peace had n't been as difficult as some had imagined . Or it was n't being that difficult . Ex-soldiers were returning to old jobs . Ex-soldiers were returning to school , or planning to , taking with them , so Ewing had heard , an intent and interestand determination new to all campuses . The factories that had turned out war materials were turning to the scanted needs and demands of consumers . Young Mort was n't a veteran , and young Mort felt bad , not because he wanted more schooling but because he had n't had a part in the big scene . He had wanted to go . Ewing had n't argued one way or the other . He had excused himself from the draft board when young Mort 's number came up , saying other members ought to pass on the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second one on the way , but that consideration in itself was n't decisive . What was was his classification as a necessary man , engaged in work important to victory . Sound enough reason , Ewing thought . The ranch was toop237much for him to operate single-handed . If old Dune McDonald , his long-time foreman , had been alive , the two of them could have managed all right . But old Dune was dead , and his like was not to be found except in young Mort . " I 'm sorry , Son , " he said to himself , knowing the boy brooded . " I 'm damn sorry , but no one better ever tell me that you dodged . " Just off Main Street Ben Tate had his new building , which was n't so new but still looked it . Ben was in plain sight at his desk , talking with Frank Brobeck , who was on his feet , as if about to take leave . Ewing entered and said , " How , Ben ? How , Senator ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home that I carry this goddamn stick . " " I was just sayin ' so long , " Brobeck answered , smiling . " Now I 'll sure as hell go , seein ' you do n't know me by my first name . Good luck . " He went out . " Take a chair , Mort , " Tate said . " How 's Julie ? " " Up in the collar like always . Trompin ' me underfoot . Been quite a while since I 've run across Mary Jess . " " She 's at home , probably working . " " I miss her pieces in the paper . Lots of folks do . " " I know , but the fact is she 's too good for it . " " Yeah , I guess so . Sometimes I see her stuff in the Atlantic or Harper 's or somewhere . Nice pieces . " " Nice , and at good prices , too . " There was a touch of pride in Tate 's voice , if a man could be proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write rings around me . Always could . " Ewing offered Tate a cigarette and took one himself , Julie not being there to see him . It struck him that Tate was growing into middle age . Hell , he was already there , except in an old duffer 's reckoning . His hair was half-gray , and his body had settled , givinghim the look , not of flabbiness , but of solid assurance . " It do n't seem to bother you , " Ewing said . " Bother me , for heaven 's sake ! Her talent ? Her national publication ? Bother me ! " " Good for you . "  | " We 've both found our niches . " " More power to you , Ben . So what else is with you ? " " Few brickbats in the air . Some people do n't like it that I speak for the Indians . " " They got a shitty deal . Always have . " " Try convincing readers of that . " " And bein ' treated shitty , they get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of things , Mort . You tend to conform to your stereotype . " Tate paused and went on . " I think the bars ought to close down at midnight . " " Or sooner maybe . " " Some people disagree violently . You 'd be surprised . " " I doubt it . I see what you print , and I hear people talk . " " About birth control ? About the editorial in favor of limitingfamilies ? " " Sure . " " Delegations called on me . Fundamentalist preachers . Priests . Spokesmen for both . They did n't request , they demanded a reversalof attitude . " Ewing already knew about that . He knew that the demands had made Tate speak out stronger than ever . He knew how Tate had handled a couple of rough customers who had bitched about news stories and had come to the office to rough up the editor and had left with their tails dragging . Looking at him now , Ewing thought that Tate was no man to tangle with , not without just cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve . Push it too far if you hankered for showdown . " Think on it , Ben , " Ewing said . " You 're just ahead of your time . " " Should n't I be ? " " Suits me . " " I can handle the brickbats so long as I 'm sure in my mind . Sure sure , Brobeck would say . There are more of them flying , now that I 've said to give Harry Truman a chance . " Tate leaned forward and put a hand to his chin . " I try to get out a good paper , Mort , the very best I know how to . "  | " It 's your paper , Ben . It 's burned with your brand . It 's better than people deserve . Not that I was n't always on your side , but I got to say now you 've growed up . You 're a man , boy , a by-God man . For a minute Tate 's face looked stricken , as if , unbeknownst to him before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thanks , Mort , " he said softly . A thoughtful , sober expression came on him , something like that of Prof Collingsworth when he looked west to the butte . He put his cigarette out . " Did you ever think that all men owe debts ? " He fell silent , not as if he expected an answer , and added , " I have debts I can never repay . " " Now , how 's that ? " " Not money , Mort . Not that . Call it example . Call it help in being whatever I am . The best I can do is pay honest interest . " " I did n't come to hear a confession , " Ewing said , " but just who are these Christly characters ? " " I 'll name just three . " Like in the Trinity , Ewing thought in a corner of his mind . He kept still . " They are old Macalester Cleveland , Benton Collingsworth and Mort Ewing . " Ewing said , " Shit ! " and got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calf talk . " On the street it occurred to him that he had been in a sore-assed mood all afternoon and now he was n't . He found himself twirling his cane like an old fool . That goddamn kid name of Tate . That goddamn Ben . He strode on . Julie would be anxious about him.  |p240Doc  CRABTREE cursed himself , cursed the years and cursed the long-time patients who did n't leave him time to curse his arthritis . But there , by God , his shoelaces were tied , and the telephone had been silent all night . He got up and took the coffee pot from the hot plate and poured himself a cup . If he did say it himself , he made better coffee than he could buy . Better food , too , thanks to long practice and the recipes left by his wife in years almost forgotten . These days in restaurants a man was a master chef if he could fry hamburger and uncap a Coke . Wonderful diet for kids . He put his coffee cup down , unscrewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink from the faucet . A splash of whiskey in the coffee would n't hurt , either . He had lost all taste for breakfast . Physician , heal thyself . Yeah . But where was the man and where was the medicine that could conquer arthritis ? Nowhere . That was where . He let himself down in a chair by his oilcloth-covered table and sipped from his cup . In a little while his joints would ease up , but never enough . He could n't use the knife anymore , no matter how he babied his fingers . Hell , sometimes he could hardly get his pecker out of his pants . In too many cases , not of arthritis alone , medicine stood helpless . Before the common cold , even , it wrung its hands and could offer no more than aspirin , liquids and bed rest , which had the single advantage of doing no harm . You 're feeling sorry for yourself , he thought . Great stuff ! The stuff of a lot of murky philosophical writing that Prof Collingsworthhad foisted on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make much himself . Take that Norwegian or Swede , Kierkegaard . A woe-is-me guy , he was , a lonely , suffering believer , who harped out something like : Alone , alone and tortured and sad , Lord , my God , in whom I put my whole self and trust , believing in You and You solely , though it appear that You treat me ill . No wonder the man never did an honest day 's work in his life . He just enjoyed suffering . The wonder was that Ben Tate , reading more of him , found interesting a few bits of his wailings . He had drained his cup when the telephone rang . The time was too early yet for the girl to be at the office or for Paul Whitaker , whom he had taken on as associate . More , the caller probablywould insist on his services . He had a notion to let the thing ring off the wall but made himself get up and walk to it . " Yes . Yes . Mrs. Anderson , you say ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you this morning if possible . You , not Dr. Whitaker . " Much good an associate did him ! Old patients demanded old doctors . " All right . All right . Directly . " He hung up . There was n't one blessed thing he could do for old Mrs. Andersonexcept cheer her up and make sure she had her digitalis and nitroglycerin and pee pills . That heart of hers was on its last legs . A professional diagnosis , that ! A fine figure of speech ! He went back to the kitchen and poured a half-cup of coffee . Not for the first time it struck him as he drank that he had never saved a life , never in his career . At his best he had merely staved off death , which had time to wait and in time would assert itself . Sometimes it was tardy . An old bastard like himself had lived too long already . He could n't say the same of Mort Ewing . It took a roll under a horse to remind him he was n't immortal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sight . And even old Mrs. Andersonkept staring death down , that old gal , that old , gentle gal who was tempered like a cold chisel and would n't let even her own daughter know how sick she was . Why did n't she call one of the younger physicians , one without arthritis , who had a potful of faith in the magic of medicine ?  |p242He  put on his hat and picked up his bag in the office . The day looked fair enough , and the drive up to the bench would n't hurt him . As a matter of fact it was helping him , he thought as he drove toward the hill that led up from the valley . It was loosening him up even as his hands twinged on the wheel . The morning sun warmed old bones . And left and right and ahead and behind was the land that had claimed him . High plains , mountain and butte , dome of sky , crystal water  --  these fastened on a man . These held him captive . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same old things . No advanced study for him , no big-city practice , no College of Surgeons , no name of renown . They had faded beyond ambition and reach while he worked contentin captivity . Content ? The car climbed the hill to the bench , and fields and pastures rolled by . They lay barren now or tanned by vanished heat . Branding and haying and harvest were over , and creature and earth , breathing September 's sun , waited for winter and then the new time of creation . It was a season of catching breath , of tarrying , of lazily laying hope in the hope chest . Content ? The word was as good as any but left a margin of error . A man did n't lay dream aside without remembering it , without thinking of what might have been . Take Prof Collingsworth , dead and gone now , along with his smile and his furies . He might have been a great educator . Hell , he had been a great educator , too big for a little town . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistress he could n't live without or shake off . It had been maddening , that confining attachment , or it must have been , else why his dark moods and ready rages ? Maybe he did n't quite know the reasons for them . Maybe nobody really did . Just put it down that Collingsworth had a hot temper . Allow again , though , for the idea that the land was his mistress , and he stayed in her bed , full of love and frustration . Driving , lazing along alone , freed the mind . A man could think what he would . He could range as far as he wished . Hep243could remember , rehearse and consider , with no fool on hand to offer a penny for what lay in his mind . Prof Collingsworth had suffered two strokes , but it was cancer of the prostate that killed him . He had rallied from the strokes , you could say , if you spoke just of muscles and left out mentality . In time he could get about pretty well , but he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting , blank wonder in the blue eyes turned gray , as if he were seeking the lost pathways of mind . Sometimes he would recognize you , sometimes he would n't . Often , after starting a sentence , he would stumble , the track of thought gone , and then say , as if to cover embarrassment , " It does n't matter . " A pitiful goddamn state to be in , when you still had sense enough to know you did n't have any . In the distance he could see his destination , a neat huddle of buildings standing against the far junction of earth and sky . No need to hurry . Out of old friendship he had been this way many times , only to do and say what he had done and said before . It was after the first stroke , after Mary Jess had written Prof 's resignationto the school board , that the cancer had made itself evident . Doc Crabtree saw himself in his office , talking to young Whitaker , who had called on Collingsworth a few times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the question , " Whitaker was saying . A good boy , Paul was , gentle and earnest and able , not dedicated to the proposition that a medical degree entitled the holder to instant wealth . " Agreed , " Crabtree answered . " I thought that was settled . Useless in the first place and fatal in the second . " Whitaker nodded and went on slowly , as if venturing , " But a minor one ? " " I hope you 're not thinking what I suspect . " " I suppose I am . " " A goddamn orchidectomy . " " Yes . The absence of the male hormone  --  well , Doctor Crabtree , you know better than I about that . " Whitaker 's handp244came out in a little , asking gesture . " It figures to prolong his life . " " Good God Almighty , Paul . Prolong his life ! What life ? " Whitaker appeared a trifle puzzled , as all young doctors would , Crabtree supposed . Keep the heart beating , keep the lungs breathingup to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be better off dead . Only old doctors knew enough to hold off on treatment when further treatment was cruel . " You never got to know the real Collingsworth , did you ? " Crabtreeasked . " No . Not when he was at himself . " " Not in his prime , Paul . Damn it , there was a man with balls , honest-to-God balls , and I be goddamned if we send him to his grave without ' em . Son of a bitch , boy ! Castrate Collingsworth ! " The Anderson house stood clearer , the house once owned by old Mr. Greenwood , now safe in the arms of the socialist Jesus . She would meet him at the door if she were able , a frail old lady who hated frailty . In his mind he was again at the Collingsworth house when Prof Collingsworth died . He heard the last of the snoring breath of coma and closed the dead eyes and brought up the sheet . Mary Jess was holding a dead hand . " It 's all over , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afresh that , despite the show of strain , she was an uncommonly pretty woman . Her fine-drawn features retained much of the look of her little-girlhood . " I wish Ben could have been here , " she said in a voice like a leaf 's rustle . " He would n't have gone if he had n't felt sure Father would last until he got back . " " I felt sure , too . I encouraged him to go to Helena for that meeting . " " I have to wire Charles , " she said , as if that small task oppressed her . For an instant , memory slipped forward to Charles Collingsworth , who had come and gone after the funeral , an agreeable and gentle but rather sad young man who had been in the war , not as a combatant , but as a member of a musical group that entertained troops . A man ? Whatever he was , it was just as well he had returned to New York . Arfive was no place for him.  |p245Thought  was a queer and wandering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and back , while the eye only half-saw the road and the skunk that ambled into the bushes . So he was back at Prof 's bedside again , and he motioned toward the door and said , " Come on , Mary Jess . Come on now . " She followed him into the living room and perched on a chair as if about to take wing while he stood . " I 'll see to arrangements , immediate ones , " he told her . " You 'll want Lawrence Chiles , I suppose . " Yes , but not yet , please , Doctor . " With the tip of her tongue she wet her dry-looking lips . " That 's the same room in which Mother died . You know . You were there . " " Yes . Yes . But now to other things , Mary Jess . Whom do you want to stay with you ? " " No one . I 'm all right . " " Look here . You 're not going to wait here alone until Ben can reach home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ewings . " She gazed at him without speaking . It was as if there were no life in that fine face , only the life of remembrance . She was a little girl again , standing desolate just outside the door when her mother died . " Father was so much a part of me , " she said , still in that rustlingvoice . " So much a part of all the life that I know . " A hint of challenge came into her tone . " He was a good man , Doctor Crabtree . You know he was a good man . " " You do n't need a second to that sentiment . It should console you . " But he died . " " As other good men have . The time comes sooner or later . Survivors adjust . Things go on . " " I tried to please him . I always tried . " Crabtree felt like shaking himself , like shaking her . " Everyone knows that . Good Lord , girl ! It would n't have pleased him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly that . " " All along , I could hope . " lle nodded and stepped forward and took one of her hands . " Of course . And now you have to be reconciled . "  | " I wish Ben were here . " " We 'll try again to reach him . He 'll get word , and he 'll be on the way , do n't you worry . " For the first time tears shone in her fine eyes . She did n't wipe them away . She said , " I need Ben , " and then added as her thought shifted , " Poor Father . " " Mary Jess , dear , he 's better off now . Think of his death as release . His release . " Her shimmering eyes rose to his , and her mouth shaped , " His release . " Something came into her face , something of heightened bereavement or dawning knowledge , he could n't tell what or which . She repeated , " Release . " Of itself his car had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old horse that knew where to stop . Now he 'd go with his satchel and hold the old lady 's hand.  |p247IT  WAS A WINTER , Ben reflected , the like of which even old-timers could hardly remember . They would think back for a worthy comparison and then shrug and perhaps say , " We 've had it just as bad . Now let me see . " Mort Ewing would shake his head and remark that you never could tell in Montana . The seasons came and went , never to be forecast from seasons before . Hell , even day by day you never could tell . The Weather Bureau itself was as likely to be wrong as right . He sat in his office and looked , not at the waiting page in the typewriter , but at the big window that gave on the street . Little good it did him now , with snow sweeping across it and ice built up at the edges . No human figures passed by to be recognized only as shapes bundled and storm-bent . No business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who got about gathered in bars or the lobbies of hotel and bank , a little boastful and glad that they had dared face the weather . Outside they would squint toward the west , toward the mountains , snow-mantled , from beyond which , surely sometime , the chinook wind would blow . In its place , he thought as his mind tried to fiddle with words to be put into print , came more snow and more cold  --  fifty below one night  --  and the land lay stiff , and the house mourned in the night . So it had been since early November , week after week of snowfall , wind and , after it , still nights with the frigid stars flaming . The winter solstice came and passed , and so did Christmas , and left the weather unchanged . Except for one day , one single day , when the chinook blew , andp248the hopeful said the backbone of winter was broken , only to speak differently when morning came . He pushed the typewriter aside and went into the shop . Okay Myers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readying type for the little job press . Young Myers , himself not young anymore , was back at the Linotype . Okay said , " That squirt has n't shown up . Some shop , with no printer 's devil . " " How you fixed otherwise ? " " Fair . Just fair . " Myers ' eyes were accusing . " Not much job work left . Not enough copy to put out the paper . " " Do n't worry , " Ben said and turned back . Myers was both an old mother hen and a good man , as fussy about the fortunes of publishing as the owner himself . A lot fussier . Needlessly fussy . He returned to the office and sat down before the typewriter , saw what he had written , tore it from the machine and rolled in a fresh page . His subject was the killing winter of 1886-87 , now dim in the memory of the oldest Montanan , revived , when it was , largely through reports and books written years back and by a celebratedpostcard picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fame overtook him . Make it light , Ben told himself . Make it cheerful . Start with a bullet lead , maybe , " We 've lived through worse . " He typed for a few minutes , consultingnotes he had taken , and felt satisfied , though his mind kept trailing away . He and Mary Jess would get up in the morning and try to peer through a window layered with ice to get the thermometer reading , and then , in order to get it , he would dodge outside , where the cold stiffened nostrils and mouth and burned his lungs . Seldom would the car start . On days when it would n't , he would get into storm coat , overshoes and mittens and leave to Mary Jess , who insisted on this bit of help , the business of tying a muffler to cover his lower face . Cap over his ears , he would plough and slide to the office . " I feel guilty , " Mary Jess would say , kissing him goodbye before she adjusted the muffler . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to fight weather . "  | " You 're not to worry . Hear ? " he would answer . " You have your work , I have mine , and that 's good . " He would smile . " I would n't let you go out today . Oh , do you need anything ? " If she required much in the way of supplies , he would take it to Hanson 's Garage and get a ride home . If it was little , he carried it , first in one hand , then in the other , and arrived with fingers clinched to the package . The front door opened , letting in both a cloud of frost and young Bob Perry , whom he had employed as reporter less than a year ago . " A lot of cattle are starving , " Bob said needlessly , shedding his wraps . He was all youthful enthusiasm , bucked up by emergency . " They 're flying hay in . Going to drop it . " " Late recognition , too late for some cattle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't need help . " " How so ? " " You would n't ask if you knew Mort and young Mort better . But never mind . The printers need copy . " Bob went to the rear of the office and sat down at his typewriter . The keys began to tap . He had forgotten his own story , neglected it as he would n't want Bob to do . He fixed his eyes on the page and his notes . Fifty-percentlosses in cattle here , seventy-five-percent losses there , total losses elsewhere  --  those were the reports that had come in when ranchers could get about to assess herds after that bitter winter of long ago . The hard lesson learned was that cows had to be winterfedin Montana and states adjoining . No more trusting to nature to bring them through . Without hay , no sure survival . He finished a page , inserted another and sat staring at it , knowinghis mind was divided , knowing he could n't quite make it single . It was in weather like this weather was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died . Somehow Doc Crabtree had made it to her house , though too late to save her . In all likelihood the trip , if managed earlier , would have been fruitless , but , anyhow , there was old Doc for you , faithful to call . Come rain or shine , hell or high water , boil point or subzero , there he was somehow.  |p250The  postal service , instead of bragging on itself , might admire and pursue his example . Mattie Murchison came from Minnesota for the funeral , arrivingtardily at Great Falls on a train that had been held up by snowdrifts . With the help of snowplows Lawrence Chiles had managed to meet her and bring her to Arfive . " Want to look over this ? " Bob Perry asked from his typewriter seat . Ben moved aside to the copy desk and took the three pages . He edited and headlined the story and said , " Take it back to Okay . Nice story , but you might remember there are two m 's in ' accommodate . ' " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my beat ? " " Such as it is . Remember , the mayor has something for us . Probably an original message that the hour is darkest just before dawn . " " In other words , if you 'll excuse me , bullshit . " The boy looked timidly hopeful of approval . " It takes a certain amount , whatever you choose to call it , to nourish a newspaper . " Bob smiled , and Ben smiled back at him , and Bob said , " Yes , sir . " He went into the shop , returned almost immediately , put on his wraps and walked out into the storm . Ben went back to his typewriter . He was as good as done with his story now , and Okay was n't so shy on copy as he made it appear . Mary Jess and he had wired for flowers for the funeral , had attendedchurch services and gone to the cemetery in the car he had had to have towed beforehand to get the engine to fire . It was the graveyard scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of earth under the false grass carpet the undertaker had laid , the little group , pallbearers included , exhaling the white smoke of frost , the chilled preacher who believed in Lordly benevolence . He could n't tell much about Mattie , who stood with her head bent , burdened with wraps . He could imagine the chunks of earth thudding on the casket as the grave was closed , the littlep251crowd gone now , the sense of loss rolling to the more comfortable climate of home fires , the old body left to unkind mother earth . He shook himself and completed his story and put it aside and let his mind drift . Mary Jess and he had made a courtesy call that evening , churningup the hill to the bench to the clank of chains , a homemade cake resting between them . Mattie herself met them at the door , thanked them for the cake and saw them in . Seated in the living room were Frank Brobeck and the long-time tenants , the Broquists , who had managed the farm for old Mr. Greenwood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exchanged greetings and sat down again , stiff as waiting-room patients , as distant from one another as if no commonlanguage existed . Only Mattie managed a show of sociability . She asked them , please , to find chairs , put the cake on a table already crowded and turned back to say , " If you 're hungry , for heaven 's sake help yourselvesto the good things people have brought . " No one moved , and she added , " Later , then . You need n't hold back . Friends have been so generous . " Scrap by scrap the conversation got going . Ben listened and looked . Time had been good to Mattie . It might have shortened a trifle that old , free stride , but it had left her face almost unlined , her figure straight , her body obviously vigorous . And yet it was as if he were observing somebody new to him , somebody old and somebody new , with only the threads of unspokenawareness relating them to him . He thought he saw that awareness in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Underneaththe chatter was his memory of the old Tuesday nights , of his education in sex , of their lying side by side satisfied . Yet it was n't he who had lain so , not himself now , but some strange versionworked on by the years , recognized only dimly , accepted with something of  --  right word  --  rue . Mattie 's remembered words came to his ears . " Mike  --  my son , you know  --  will be mustered out before long . Thank the Lord , he survived those flying missions . He 's still in England . "  |p252Then  , in answer to somebody 's question , " Yes , I 'm thinking of moving back and living here on the farm . " The Ewings , in force , had arrived then and , soon afterwards , some other friends from country and town . After a bite to eat , Mary Jess and he had taken their leave . He tapped out a headline for his storm story , took the copy into the shop and came back and sat down again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob 's unwritten copy to edit later before the time came to knock off . He flicked on a light , for the early dark was settling in , or unsettling in , worried by the whip of the winter wind . Another bitter night in store . But something could be said for the long cold . There was the final coziness of home , the sense of safe shelter from all the furies . He and Mary Jess would talk good talk while he drew on the pipe he had taken to . Or they would read or listen to music while reading . No matter . The worries of the day were outside , along with the cold and the wind . Later they would go to bed and sleep close , the two of them against desolation , and they would murmur a word or two , warm body to body , and sleep would flow over them , sleep that did n't need to knit the ravels of care . Once , after her brother had come and gone from their father 's funeral , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what did you reallymake of Charles ? " " He was pleasant enough . " " You 're avoiding the question . " " Am I ? " " Out of consideration for me ? " " That would be a good reason , dear . " " He is one of them , is n't he ? You know what I mean . " " He 's a sad man , but your worry wo n't help him . " She gave him a sudden hug and pressed closer , facing him . It was all right , he had thought . It had been all right for a long time . He supposed , like all men , he would always speculate about other women , about good-looking girls , but speculation was idle when love at last had brought understanding , and it , in turn , the final commitment.  | " Oh , Ben , " she had said into his thoughts , " I 'm so glad you 're a whole man . I 'm so glad you 're you . " " It 's mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said and kissed her , and his hand brought up her nightgown . The door flung open to a great puff of vapor , and Bob Perry said , " You were right about the mayor , " and there was the editorialyet to be written.  |p254APRIL  COULD BE and usually was a harsh month in Montana , Mary Jess reflected as she rode along with Ben at the wheel . All the spring months , including May , could be harsh , months of wind and snow flurries and rain that was almost snow . Even so , she thought , remembering , they were better than the months just passed . With hardly a pause the bitter , winter weather had held until almost the last of February and then had yielded to a windy , fretful , and unpredictable March . Today was clear and not too cold . Under the force of the wind and occasional touches of warmth the snow drifts had shrunken . Like veins , runners of blown dirt threaded their surfaces . But to the west the mountains rose pure , a ragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit the top of Ear Mountain . Ben was silent , and for this little time she chose to be . They often were . They did n't need speech as a lubricant . They crossed the bridge over the Breast . The river was edged with white ice . Between its frozen shores the stream ran dark . At last she asked , " We wo n't be late , Ben ? " " Plenty of time , " he answered , yet consulted his wrist watch . " Maybe half an hour for drinks , even . " " You might be disappointed , " she said , just for amusement . " Not with Mort there . You think young Mort would n't have a bottle for his father ? " " You have to learn to call him Phil . " The full name ran in her head : Morton Phillip Ewing , Jr . " He should n't have to live as a shoot , growing in the shadow of Mort . " Ben said , " Yes , ma'am , " and smiled  |p255He  steered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ewing ranch . Wheels had worn and skidded ruts in it , leaving shoulders of mud that were stiffening as the half-hearted sun sank . The car lurched along . On a slope , before the house came in sight , cattle nosed for the wisps of hay overlooked when first they were fed . Young calves mingled with them , pushing for udders when the cows halted . " Good condition , " Ben said and added , " you 'd expect it . " Then the house came into view . Not one house but two , and barns and a corral and outbuildings . The smaller house , she knew , once sheltered Mort 's old ranch foreman . Sometimes it served as a bunkhouse these days , replacing the cabin used formerly . Smoke climbed from a chimney , straight in the still air . As Ben braked to a stop , a big dog ran out , barking a welcome that his tail seconded . Mort opened the house door before they could knock . " Come in and get the chill off , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they entered , Phil stepped up to shake hands with Ben . Julie greeted them , and , after her , Mabel . The Ewings ' two boys , one hardly more than a toddler , squirmed through to mix with the company . A fire flamed in the big fireplace . Phil took their wraps and told them to find seats . Over his shoulder he said , " Dad , you 're the bartender . Ca n't you see these people need saving ? " " I was waitin ' till they fell over , " Mort answered . " But all right . I know the poison they got a taste for . " He went through the open doorway into the kitchen . By the time he returned , a glass in each hand , little Tony had climbed onto Ben 's knee , and Ben was giving Baby Jon a hand up . They were like that with Ben , more so than with others . As she took the glass that Mort offered her , it came to her mind how little it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives . Almostnot at all , save for these two Ewing children . To be sure , Ben engaged high-schoolers to help in the shop or gather personal items , and rather recently he had hired a young editorial assistant , whom he liked  --  but beyond that ?  | " Mort , " Julie was saying as Mort gave Ben his glass , " wo n't you ever learn to use a tray ? " " Look out there , young'ns , " Mort said . " Leave the man one hand free , anyhow . " " He 's Uncle Ben , " Tony told him . " Are n't you my Uncle Ben ? " Ben answered , " You betcha . " " Now as to a tray , " Mort said , turning toward Julie , " I 'm not servin ' tea . " Julie laughed and started to rise , saying , " You could save yourselfsteps , " but Mabel jumped up . " Let me , " she told Julie . She and Mort went into the kitchen and returned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Jess thought as the drinks were being served and talk flowed around her . Mabel , an old-fashioned name suitable to a stocky and unpretending woman who seemed cut out to be a ranch wife . No condescension there in that thought . No derogation . Recognition , rather , and more than a touch of admiration . Had Mabel conceived and carried the babies in her body without that wild terror of childbirth she herself had once known ? Had Mabel given birth to these children without qualms about what might be in store for them ? With no misgivings about the world and the lives they would be forced to live ? Probably she had n't considered . She was too healthy for fear of the future , too natural . The present was dear beyond any anxiety about the dim years ahead . Mort , standing , lifted his glass . " Here 's to peace and prosperity , " he said . After they had drunk to his toast , he went on . " A bad-matched team there , Ben . Peace and prosperity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Phil answered for Ben . " Aw , cut it out , Dad . This is n't a wake . " " Just wanted to keep talk flowin ' free , " Mort said , seating himself . " On the bright side , then . I 'm pleasured to be in good company . " He waved his glass around . " And double glad to be back at the ranch . "  | " That goes for all of us , " Phil said . " Come a real break in the weather , " Mort continued , looking toward Mary Jess , " we 're movin ' from the dang town . " She supposed his language was restrained because of the children . " Do you find town so bad ? " she asked . " Worse'n that . Course , if you got something to do , like Ben , I reckon it 's tolable . But for an old fool like me , I tell you it 's torment . Nowhere to go but to saloons . Nothin ' to do but drink , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Julie smiled . Ben was doing simple finger tricks for the children . " We could use a good man , " Phil said , looking at his father . " Comin ' up , " Mort answered . " Be here for brandin ' . What I figure , " he went on , now looking at Ben , " is to redo the other house , or maybe build a new shack entirely . Eh , Julie ? " " Whatever you say . " She added , " When I 'm sure you 're well enough . " " What a man has to put up with ! What a well man has to put up with ! " Mort 's eyes went to the others , away from Julie . " She knows I 'm finer'n frog hair . It 's just she likes high society . " " I like you better , " Julie said , her smile indulgent . " We have time for another , " Mabel told them . She gathered the glasses on the tray , went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , saying before she left , " Excuse me . A few last-minute things . " Mary Jess told her , " I 'll help . Let me , " but Mabel shook her head . " Julie 's already been more help than I could ask . " They were called soon to dinner , or supper as Mort would have called it , into a dining room of linen and candlelight . " That 's a noble roast , " Ben said , seeing it . Mabel saw to seating them and said to Mort , " Dad , do n't you want to carve ? " " Just because the Injuns taught me to chunk meat , I 'm an expert , I am . " He was an expert . The plates went around and were added to from side dishes of potatoes , mashed rutabagas , hot biscuits andp258gravy . For a salad there were spiced peaches and cottage cheese on lettuce leaves . The little boys sat on either side of Phil , who cut their meat for them and helped the smaller one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the food , comments on weather , chit-chat about people in town , talk of the calf crop , the market and later prospects . At one point Mort said , " I have n't been around long enough to see so much snow in the mountains before . God himself has n't , I reckon . Must surprise Him , seein ' the woods covered over and every dang canyon choked up to the rim . " " Means plenty of irrigation water , " Phil answered . " Yup . Plenty . God 's plenty . " They had hardly finished the dessert of chocolate pie with whipped cream than little Tony said , " Playtime . " Phil groaned and replied , " Hold up a minute there , boy . Coffeeand smokes come before that . Do n't you see that big people have rights ? " Mort answered , saying with a smile , " Nope . " " No , " Mabel said to Julie and Mary Jess . " We 'll leave the dishes . Please . " When they were seated again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'll play bucking horse . " " Will we now ? Who says so ? " " Please , Dad . Pretty please . Look at Jon . He wants to , too . " Pretending reluctance , Phil left his chair and lowered himself to hands and knees , and Tony straddled his back . Phil let him ride there , making only a show of bucking while the boy hung on , crowing . Smiling , Jon waited his turn . Mort looked on with grandfatherly indulgence . It was hard to think of him as a grandfather . It was impossible to think of him as old . His eye was still bright , his face lined by weather rather than years , and , when he walked , he walked straight and sure , not with the duck-foot and high-knee action of age . Mary Jess let her eyes rest on Ben . He was grinning , his teeth showing through his pleased smile . He sat on the edge of hisp259chair . With a little encouragement , Mary Jess thought , he would play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a shoulder . He had to lie flat to let Jon get on . After a tour of the room , Jon fell off happily . They had another turn each before Mabel said , " All right , boys . Fun 's over . Bedtime . " They insisted first on going around to kiss everybody good night , then let themselves be shooed away . Outside , the night 's chill pressed against them as they went to the car after saying goodbye . The sky showed no star and no moon . The headlights cut an uncertain path through the dark . The mud had frozen , and the hard lumps of it , carved and misshapenby light , jolted them . They rode without speaking until they reached the turn to the highway . There Ben slowed and looked close at her , and his hand reached for hers . " Something on your mind ? " he said . " Something upset you , made you feel sad ? " She squeezed his hand . " After such a good evening ? Sad ? Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben , for herself who had failed him , sad somehow for everyone in the world.  | " THIS STATE is like some goddamn drunk , " Mort Ewing said , " one of those jokers that 's got his arm around you one minute and his fists in your face the next . " A smile appeared on his weathered face , paled somewhat by his long months in town . " Only it 's been one hell of a spell between hugs . " He and Ben Tate sat at a table in a corner of Jim Sowder 's bar , both damp from the rain that was pelting outside . In this weather Sowder had few customers . Those coming and going had left wet trails from door to bar stools . " June in Montana , " Ben answered . " Typical , only more so . " He sipped at the drink he had decided to have before going home . " No sign of a break . The weather reports call for more . " " Never say typical here . What 's typical is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atypical . " " That 's it . " Ewing stretched and sighed and picked up his glass . " Sure , the rain will help many a crop and pasture , and the lucky ones are thanking the Lord , but I do n't like it . " " You 're not alone . Neither do I. " Ewing went on as if to himself . " All this rain , and the snow pack in the mountains deeper and higher'n Christ can remember . Every damn stream will be runnin ' over its banks if it ai n't over already . " He looked up . " You seen the Breast ? " " Even last night I could hear it from the house . " " I went to the ranch yesterday . Furloughed , you might say , by Julie . Came in an hour ago . Crossin ' by the bridge , I sure no/ticed . " He shrugged . " Worst that can happen at the ranch is my ditch might wash out , but Jesus ! " " In the paper last week I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too early then for a real warning . " Ewing signaled for a refill , and Sowder came puffing with the drinks . " Wet enough for you ? " he asked , putting them down . " Why , now , is it raining ? " Ewing said . He looked at the window and added , " Oh , shitaree . " Sowder laughed and puffed back to the bar and resumed the game of cribbage he was playing with Clarence Landusky . " Got a great sense of humor , that man , " Ewing said , lowvoiced , and went to work on his drink . Then he said , " Ben , there 's them too dumb to know what may be in store . " " I 've thought about that , too . I guess none of us are prepared , dumb or not . " " Build an ark and put on board two of each kind . " " Be serious , Mort . " " I am , kind of . " His expression grew serious . " I 've outgrowed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to Prof Collingsworth , figurin ' things out best we could . But even was he alive , we would n't be the head and the hoof and the haunch and the hump anymore , like old Macalester Cleveland said . Know who is ? " " Nobody , Mort . " " Wrong . You and Frank Brobeck , that 's who . Prof and I pass the goddamn torch to you , boy . " " There 's the mayor and members of the Chamber of Commerce and plenty of others . " " Do n't shit me . " " All right . Thanks . Go on . " " You got to allow for the fact the dam might go out . Then where are you ? Where is Arfive ? " " That 's been on my mind , too . " " Uh-huh . Caught you . You been plannin ' already . Just what now ? " " Just notes in my mind . "  | " Reel ' em off . " " Appoint captains . Assign districts and households to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a distress telephone . Have food ready to take up to the hill towards the bench . All that 's for starters . It 's all for emergency . " " Good boy . Add sandbags , if there 's time . Any reports on the dam ? Aerial survey ? Forest Service ought to know . " " I checked . One aborted flight . Poor visibility . " Ewing nodded . " The sky would be hangin ' too low there . What about the dam people themselves ? " " Nothing . They 're keeping mum . " " That figures . They would n't admit that their baby might go down the drain . " Ben called for two more drinks . Sowder did n't comment this time . Ewing went on . " The Breast is too dinky a stream for figures on flood stage , rate of flow , likely crest , and all that . But , Ben , who knows for sure ? It could come in a day or so , three or four at the outside . We could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved but our nightshirts . " " Tomorrow I 'm going to drive up to the dam and see for my-self . " " If you can get there . Stay on the high road . Take Brobeck with you . I 'll go along if Julie 'll let me . " Ewing smiled . " She wants to save me for some goddamn museum . " Ewing finished his drink , got up and said , " Call me , Ben . " They both put on raincoats . Ben followed him out . The rain was still falling . Ben 's car sputtered and died and sputtered again until finally all cylinders fired . At dinner Mary Jess said , " Wo n't this rain ever stop ? What 's the prediction ? What do you hear ? Ben , you 're not listening . " " Sorry , " he answered . " I was just thinking . " Rain drummed on the roof of the kitchen , where they often ate when alone . The flow and gurgle of downspouts sounded from outside . " Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be safe in this house . We 're high enough . Please stay in it , Mary Jess . " " You 're not very illuminating , but I suppose you 're thinking of the danger of flood ? " " Every dry Swale , every wrinkle of land between here and town is running water . In low spots it 's over the road . " " So ? " " Same everywhere , Mary Jess , and it will be worse . " " How worse ? Now come on , Ben . " He shrugged . " God knows . " He had n't wanted to tell her , had wanted to spare her any anxiety about him , but their tie , one to another , demanded he speak . " The worst is that the big dam might go out . I must have a look at it . " " Oh , no , Ben . Please do n't . It 's frightening . " The look in her eyes was enough . She need not have spoken . He reached over and patted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sweetheart . Frank Brobeck will go along , and probably Mort . " " How ? Any car would get stuck . " " We 'll borrow a truck from the sheriff or the road department . Now please do n't worry . There 's nothing to worry about . " He smiled into the still-anxious face . " Remember , I 'm a newspaper-man . " " And lots more than that , " she said , yielding . " I ca n't stand in the way of what you feel you have to do . " He helped her with the dishes , then they read for a while and later went to sleep to the sound of rain , muted because the house was two-storied but still distinct and incessant and pleasant but for thoughts of what might be . Even with chains on , the truck skidded and floundered , and Brobeck , driving , had to peer through the windshield that the wipers could n't keep clear . " If we get there at all , " Brobeck said , " it will be by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question . Wish Skeeter Jeromep264could have scrounged up a four-wheel drive . Still , he done his best , and thanks to him . " " It 's his thanks to you , " Ewing said . " He would n't be sheriff if you had n't backed him . " " Nuts . " Ben , wedged in the middle of the single seat , kept silent . From horizon to closed-in horizon was one steady weeping . The close sky shut them in . The sun was lost . The road , little more than a wagon trail , wound through untilled grazing land though no livestockwas in sight . The homesteads that the dam watered were lower down on the benchlands . " Up this hill , if we can make it , " Brobeck said as the tires ground for purchase , " and we 'll see what we can see . Must he within five miles of the dam . " The truck spun to a halt , and Brobeck managed to back up and take a run at the trail , which was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravel and mud . Like a boat in rough water , the truck rocked to the top . There Ewing said , squinting through the windshield , " Looks like our road has taken to the water . Got a submarine handy , Frank ? " Brobeck had braked to a stop . They pulled down their hats , drew slickers around them and got out and walked , skidding , down to the river 's edge . By turns the river was a torrent and a wide sweep of water . Uprooted willows , spring-colored and budded , ran with it , along with a tree , and a boulder rose and rolled , its grating audible above the voice of the stream and the rain . " Ever seen it higher , Mort ? " Brobeck asked . " Maybe as high . No higher . Goddamn rain . " " At least the dam 's holding , " Ben said . " Or we would n't be here , " Ewing answered . A patch of red showed in the water and made itself into a drowned cow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that muddied the flow . " Dam goes out , " Ewing went on , " the whole valley will be a river , hill to hill , wide as the Mississippi low down . " " No way to tell how it 's holding , not on this road . One hell ofp265a roundabout by another route , and no sayin ' we 'd get there even then . What say , Ben ? " " Back to town . What else ? " They crowded , wet , into the truck . The rain kept a curtain around them . " I had a sneaking hunch that goddamn dam never should have been built in the first place , " Brobeck said after turning the truck around . " Flood control , they called it . " " Yep , " Ewing answered . " You might say it 's a washout , washed out or not . " " That 's not the whole of it , not the sole reason , " Ben said . Brobeck asked , " That so ? " " You have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headwaters that never should have been cut . So , quick run-off . So , big water . " " Yes to all that , " Ewing said . " At every turn , sometimes it seems to me , man fucks himself . " When they crossed the bridge close to town , Ewing eyed the stream . " Up by a foot or more . Goodbye bridge . " It was still raining when they reached the office . " Come in , " Ben said . " There 's a bottle in my desk . " " What 's the time ? " Ewing asked . " Ca n't tell by a sun that do n't show . " Brobeck answered , " Comin ' on to four o'clock . " " We 'll call it six and quittin ' time , and I 'm due a drink . " Bob Perry was waiting inside . He said eagerly , " The sheriff wants one of you to call . He 's asked three times . " But also waiting was the Reverend Mr. Jackson Moody , pastor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair and asked Ben , " May I give you a story first , Mr. Tate ? " His voice had the tone of the pulpit . " Of course . Bob here will take it . " " I thought it best to see you . You can give it its proper importance , its right emphasis . " Ben nodded , not wanting to . " I 'll write the story from Bob 's notes . Oh , Bob , bring another chair from the back , please . "  |p266They  seated themselves , all but Brobeck . Mr. Moody , a tall man , impressive of face , took his time sitting down . It struck Ben , watching , that religion had had little part in his own life , even though Mr. Collingsworth had taught the Bible class for twenty-five years . Organized religion was n't for him or for Mary Jess , but the question flitted again into his mind . Where , but from churches with all their superstitions , would come a commitment to ethics ? " I fancy myself rather a climatologist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Moody began . " Yes , " Ben said . Ewing was looking amused . " Beyond science , beyond our efforts to understand , is God . Science may predict , but God wills . " " Yes . " " We are in danger of flood , is it not so ? " " Yes . " " So I am calling a meeting , a big meeting , a community meeting for men and women of all denominations or no denominationswhatever . It will be a prayer meeting , Mr. Tate , a united appeal for the cessation of rain . " Bob Perry , taking notes , asked , " When ? " " Unless the rain ceases , Friday at eight in the evening , the day after the paper comes out . " " You better start praying now , Reverend , " Ewing said . " Postponeit , and your message might not reach God before we 're washed out . " " You sound rather irreverent , sir . " " How so ? You want to inform God , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " God already knows . " Brobeck was smiling behind his hand . " Well , then , " Ewing began . Before he could go on , Ben cut in , " All right , Mr. Moody . At your church , of course . We 'll give the story due prominence . " Mr. Moody had hardly closed the door before Bob Perry said , " The sheriff , Mr. Tate . He said what he had was important . "  |p267Brobeck  went to the phone and rang and listened . He hung up the receiver with slow gravity and turned to say , " The water 's overflowin ' the darn . Darn-tender , if that 's what he 's called , said so . He skedaddled to town . Says he 'd go to hell before he 'd stay up there , the way things are . " Ben swept his desk clear . " No time to waste , " he told Ewing and Brobeck . " You 're staying to help ? " Ewing nodded , and Bob chipped in with " Me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my old lady . "  | " DISASTER CENTER , " Ben said into the telephone . " Ben , " Skeeter Jerome answered from the sheriff 's office at the courthouse , " you better haul ass up the hill . Just received a delayedreport from the Forest Service . They finally got a plane up over the dam . Say it 's likely to go out any minute . " " I 've heard that before . " " But not official . Not so recent . Brobeck 'll come get you . " " You 're staying . " " But I have two stories to climb to , a regular crow 's nest if I 'm drowned out below . " " Tell Brobeck to wait . " " Do n't be a damn mule . Calls here have dribbled down to nothin ' . Same with you , sure as hell . " " You ca n't tell . " He hung up the phone and looked out the dark window . It was clouded with mist and spatters . Beyond it the beams of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penciling down . The flood water was rising . It had found a way through the sandbagsat the front of the office and was exploring the floor . He made a move to put on the gum boots at the side of his desk , then sat back , leaving them there . Time enough to put them on when he had to . Time . What was the correct time , if it mattered ? The clock on the wall would tell him , if he cared to consult it . What was time , anyhow ? Night and gray daylight and dark again , unmarked by hours , measured by preparations , households checked , calls receivedand succor sent in the float of night into day into night.  |p269The  town plat on his desk was a blur , until he made his eyes focus . It bore the locations of households and the names of householders . He had crossed out the places vacated . Even withoutlooking , he knew that almost all of them had been , either by the owners ' volition or with urging and help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being seen to . Beyond full report were the premises up the valley beyond the town limits . Like his own , a few places on the northern fringe were safe enough . In his eyes the plat and the names flowed together , leavingthe thought of Mary Jess alone in the house . There flowed together , too , the preparations that he and Mort Ewing and Frank Brobeck had made in a time that seemed long ago now . He forced himself to review them . Crews . They had mustered men to give warning and aid , if needed . Communications . He had cleared his telephone for emergency calls . A couple of boats had radios , borrowed from the sheriff 's office , and could send messages to Skeeter Jerome . His eyes lifted at the sound of the inner door opening , and Bob Perry floated into view . " I 've got the stock up off the floor best I could , Mr. Tate , " he said . The stock seemed not to matter , but he heard himself saying , " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get out . I 'll phone for a boat . " " What about you ? " " Time enough . " " Pardon me , Mr. Tate , but you look all done in . " He added , " No wonder . " " I 'm all right . " " Then so am I , " the boy said . " I 'll stick . " He sat down . His gaze wandered back to the list . Boats , outboard motors , food  --  these had been volunteered or appropriated at God knew whose expense . Shelter , a tardy consideration , but the shack of a clubhouse on what was coming to be known as golf-course hill was too small by far . So tents it was , offered freely or borrowed of necessity.  |p270Firewood  , almost a last thought , seen to by Mort Ewing . Sanitary arrangements , since the privy that graced the hill would n't suffice . Old Doc Crabtree was in charge of them . " I figure we 're in pretty good shape , Bob , but  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gush of water . Dripping , Frank Brobeck , in slicker , rain hat and hip boots , entered and strode forward . " Goddamn you , Ben , " he said , " Come on now . " " Some people  --  " " Forget it . They 're safe . Ingwald Jorgenson , he kicked like a steer , but we wrestled him and his missus and kid into a boat . " " The Mclntoshes ? " " I got good reason to think she took off sudden with an oil-companylease hound , and he set out after them . " Ben looked at the plat and said , " But  --  " " All seen to , for God 's sake , and if you 're not at the end of your tether , I never seen a pooped man . Get your duds on . " " You look bushed yourself , " Ben answered but bent for his gum boots . " Leave ' em . Not high enough . Got to wade on account of there 's shoal water between here and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , Bob , " Ben said to Perry . They began putting on rain gear . " Shake a leg ! " Brobeck said . " I got a very special passenger , and she 's damn impatient . " A big grin transformed his tired face . Ben looked at him and said , " No  --  ? " " Yes . The same pretty party . " " She was safe enough at the house . I asked her to stay there . " " So I understand , " Brobeck said and grinned again . Like most of the other men and some of the women Ben sat on the brow of the hill , heedless of the warm wet , and looked down in the direction of town . It was still there . The flickering street lights proved that much , as they would n't if the darn broke . Nop271eye could penetrate the dark and the mist and the still-falling rain and see the long bowl of the valley . The watchers sat on the tails of their slickers or on patches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side of him , Mary Jess on the other . Most of the children had been put to bed under the shelter of tents , and with them most of the dogs had retired . Back of him , Ben knew , bonfires tried to burn , and flashlights and lanterns glowed . Light . That was one thing he had forgotten but others had n't . The tents would be showing changing patterns of shadow . Behind them trucks and cars , driven up the hill by lucky early-comers , were spotted unevenly , all with chains on . The camp was silent , save for the sounds of movement , occasional voices pitched low , and the sometimes-heard voice of the ReverendJackson Moody , who for the time being had appropriated a tent and was holding a prayer meeting probably attended by few . It struck Ben that these people , the larger part of them , may not have wanted an answer to prayer . Here was an event , a big event , a spectacle to be seen and appreciated and , if worst came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The atmosphere was one of expectancy , not doom . " You must get some sleep , Ben , " Mary Jess said . " Frank , too . " " With a couple of drinks , thanks to Mort Ewing , and food in my stomach , I 'm a new man . " " Same here , " Brobeck put in . " Humph to you both . " They had chugged to the base of the hill earlier , seeing before them the fitful bonfires , the off-and-on eyes of flashlights and the passing whites of tents . Arrived , they might have come to a picnic . Women bustled , men spoke and laughed , children shouted , complained and played , and dogs joined the fun . All the dogs in the county , it seemed . A million dogs , give or take a half-dozen . Mort Ewing had showed them to a tent , humped inside with bedrolls . " Figured you would n't mind sharin ' it with Julie and me , " he said .

She had even asked whether Andrew intended to run for public office again  --  had expressed disappointment when told he certainly did not . " I really do n't know him , " Hannah was saying in a slow , painstakingmanner , " we were n't the right ages to become acquainted . he was so much older than I , almost another generation . . . . I mean he is . . . he still is , of course . " Yvonne glanced at her , for a moment genuinely surprised . This plain , indifferently dressed woman had deliberately insulted her !  --  for they were the same age , nearly . Hannah must have been in her early thirties , only a few years older than Yvonne . She had meant , of course , that in childhood a decade is a very long period of time  --  she had probably not meant to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two of the others were aware of the insult , enjoying the moment . " None of this is important , is it ? " she said , smiling . " Personalitiesare not so important , are they ? Your work with the children here , for instance , and your hope to get more money for the school  --  that should n't be interpreted in terms of your personal lives , should it ?  --  your private lives ? You would resent that , would n't you ? It would be quite natural to resent it  --  ? " " But we 're not famous , " one of the men said cheerfully . " None of us are famous . " A young man in his mid-twenties ; one of several teachers who worked with retarded children . Wunsch , his name was . Yvonne could not remember his first name . He had a small head , curly brown hair , eyes that looked weak but were thickly lashed  --  brown , staring , moist , slightly bulging eyes . He wore a jersey pullover sweater , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes . " We are anonymous people , " he said softly . Yvonne laughed , thinking he meant to be amusing . The others laughed , watching her . . . . Her left arm was tingling now , trembling . But she could not examine it , not in public . In her right hand she held a paper cup . Instant coffee out of a vendingmachine . She did n't want it , she did n't want any of this . Not now . The principal , that mock-friendly woman , was telling Yvonne about a talent show the school was going to present  --  would shep231like to attend , was she free a week from Friday evening ?  --  might she and Tier husband both be free ? Yvonne did n't want to sit here any longer , she did n't want any of this ; unfortunately  --  she spoke with a quick sharp smile  --  Andrew was going to receive an honorary degree at McGill , would be in Montreal that weekend , unfortunately  --  but thank you all the same . And now  --  if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young man said . He cracked the knuckles of one hand contemplatively . Yvonne noticed a large ring with a black stone , too large to be genuine . " But there 's more power in fame . There 's more power , " he said , " in power . " " A few years ago we had a talent show , sonic of the children were photographed and written up in the papers , you know , and the rumor was that they were being given contracts  --  recording companies , movies  --  you know ? But it was n't true . It was very disappointingthen , " someone said . " Yes , was n't it . " " Still , it was better than nothing . Was n't it ? " " The newspapers should n't have done that . " " But who started the rumors ?  --  The children themselves . " " More coffee , Mrs. Petrie ? You do n't have to leave so soon  --  ? " They were talking animatedly , perhaps for her benefit . She was quite nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in her life , long ago , she had considered being a teacher -- had considered , even , working with handicapped children . Her life had gone in another direction , of course . Judging from what she had seen today . . . judging from the atmosphere of this place , even of the recreational area here , and the teachers ' tired , grimly loud laughter .... No windows in the room , walls of solid concrete , several cheaply framed prints  --  one of those leprous Utrillo streets , and a skewed , flattened landscape that might have been Cezanne 's but looked machine made , and a particularly ugly " abstract expressionist " clown who looked like a parody of one of the handicappedchildren  --  an atmosphere of tension , exhaustion , pointless flippancy  --  a cork-topped table , littered now at the end of the day , ashtrays overflowing with cigarette butts and ashes and several squashed coffee cups  --  even a broken black comb  --  And the floor of scuffed tile , worn into grooves , stained and sorrowfulYvonne set the cup down and prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p232The  essence of life is ambiguity , complexity . So Yvonne knew . The essence of paranoia is the inability to tolerate ambiguity  --  even for brief periods of time . So Yvonne knew . Knows . She knows a great deal , but can not act upon it . Knowledge : but no power . The teachers and the principal and Hannah Petrie  --  harmless , decent , hard working  --  of no importance whatsoever , really  --  no threat to her  --  her own bad habit of smiling when she is angry or perplexed  --  so that the dimple in her cheek sharpens , a sudden pit , a tiny scar : she knows , sees , but can not act . She is paralyzed . The young man in the jersey is questioning her , still with that air of good-hearted curiosity . He is fascinated . He is too admiring , too attentive . He catches Yvonne 's eye as if to force an alliance between them , he and she against the others , You and I are different , are n't we ?  --  just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , returning to the subject of the televised hearings  --  the citizens ' committee to investigate the riot at the Glasberg State Prison , some months before  --  and several remarks Andrew made that subsequentlywere taken out of context and distorted and used against him  --  Were there immediate consequences ? Were there telegrams , telephone calls , letters ? Threats ? And how do they deal with such things , how do they live their lives , in the glare of such publicity ? " There are always letters , " Yvonne says . Her cheeks burn . But she will not give this bastard the satisfaction of knowing he has annoyed her . " Of course there are always letters from disturbed people . Andrew has lived with it for a long time now . Threats  --  requests for favors  --  for money  --  for information  --  for secret information  --  But also very nice letters , letters of gratitude , letters enclosing good-luck charms  --  religious medals  --  recipes  --  prayersevenlove letters  --  He receives every conceivable kind of letter , it really is n't very important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a speech or been on television . Sometimes there are gifts  --  sometimes there are things meant to frighten him  --  but nothing frightens him . It is n't important , really . He lives his life  --  we live our life  --  without being disturbed by any of this . " " Even the threats ? " " But all public figures receive threats !  --  do n't you know that ? " Yvonne says quickly . She is afraid her voice is trembling now . She is afraid everyone will see her panic . They are eying her closely , pretending to be friendly , pretending to be sympathetic . Hannahp233is even frowning at the young man in the green jersey , pretending to be displeased by his aggressive , naive manner . Questioning AndrewPetrie 's wife like this !  --  interrogating her , practically ! But Yvonne continues to speak without hesitation : " Andrew and I read everything that comes in , we do n't even trust his secretaries  --  since very clever people , very clever disturbed people , sometimes write in code  --  a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but most of the time really innocent : not serious . People say things they do n't mean . They write things they do n't mean and they think anonymity will save them  --  I mean , they think the FBI ca n't trace the letter back  --  and in most cases , I mean in most of the problem cases , there is n't any genuine feeling , no real intent to harm  --  they just write to Andrew Petrie because they 're angry about the state of the world in general , or about their own miserablelives  --  But he does n't take this sort of thing very seriously : he has a talent for knowing what is serious and what is n't , when a threat is genuine and when it 's just rhetoric . And the things I receive occasionally  --  those letters  --  they 're laughable , really  --  they have nothing to do with me at all  --  no one knows me at all , " she says , now breathing very quickly , almost panting . There is a pause , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The exasperatingthing about his  --  our  --  The tragic thing  --  I mean , the secret  --  You see , Andrew is n't a politician at all : he despises politics . He thinks of himself as a political theorist . A philosopher . An analyst  --  a historian  --  perhaps even a prophet , in a way . In a modest way . He works so hard !  --  spends months and months on a single essay  --  does so much research  --  He 's a stylist , he 's very concerned with style , with presentation  --  subtlety  --  He came to hate politics because everything is simplified , by the papers especially , everything is beaten down into headlines , reduced to a few formulas  --  Of course he 's political because in a sense we are all political  --  all of life is political , is n't it ? Nearly every aspect of life ? The tragedy is  --  the theme of his writing is  --  the difference between what people know to be true and the way they actually behave  --  that terrible , inexplicable difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political power ; he is n't even a conservative , in the usual sense of the word ; but he demands that  --  he believes that  --  the only test of a person 's belief is his action  --  his public action  --  the rest is rhetoric , the rest is illusion and deliberate mysti-fication  --  "  |p234The  black woman is staring at Yvonne , smiling her formal , slightly cynical smile ; Hannah is still frowning , pressing her glasses to her face with a forefinger , a stranger to Yvonne , not friendly , not even pretending to be friendly ; Wunsch is leaning far forward , elbows on knees , chin on knuckles , regarding her with the look of a man watching television : his gaze wandering from her face to her body , down to her slim ankles and boldly colored shoes , back up again to her face . At the sink , rinsing a china mug , is a tall , thin black man who is nodding in Yvonne 's direction . Yes ? Yes ? More  --  ? " He 's not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't think of himself as a politician , " Hannah says . " Is he aware of that ?  --  I mean , that distinction ? Is he aware of it him-self ?

" It is n't his fault , it 's the fault of people who try to simplify his ideas  --  do n't you think ?  --  and in politics everything is so blunt  --  people become polarized so easily . People with certain murderous prejudicesare so eager to  --  " " I must leave , " Yvonne says . She gets to her feet . Picks up her purse . Trembling , still , but more confident now that she is moving , once again in control of the situation . She thanks them for having shown her through the school . She speaks of being impressed , of having learned a great deal . Several of them walk with her . Wunsch even walks a little ahead , half-turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's agility . What is he saying ? Why is he smirking ? Asking her to visit the school another time  --  to visit his class  --  maybe to have lunch sometime at a restaurant not far away , on Washington Boulevard , a Greek restaurant she might like  --  ? Hannah is asking her about Andrew , whom she has n't seen for some time . Is he well ? Certainly . In excellent health . Is he still meeting with that committee , or has it disbanded ? He resigned from the committee  --  could n't bear the lies , the stupidity , the incompetence . And is he in the city , or traveling ? He is  --  He is in the city . At home . In fact Yvonne is not certain : Is he in the city , or traveling ? Orp235in another city ? Or in the mountains , at the old farm , alone , without even a telephone ... ? She is not certain . " He 's at home , " she says . They asked her to peek into their auditorium . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they said ; a royal blue carpet had recently been installed , a donor 's gift . Did she have time  --  ? Rehearsalsfor the talent show were going on and it might beYes . She had time . She could not protest . Leather-padded doors with porthole windows . Swinging doors . The trembling almost uncontrollable now  --  her arms , her neck and head  --  They led her into the auditorium , Hannah on her right , Wunsch on her left . And there  --  There it wasThe noise ! It was a drummer , a child drummer . The vibrations , the trembling  --  a boy playing drums  --  a drummer , drums ! Yvonne laughed , almost with delight . " A drummer  --  " she whispered . " That noise  --  " " What ? " Hannah asked . " The way the building is vibrating  --  " " Shhh , " Wunsch said , winking . " You 'll throw him off . " Center stage , a black boy with a set of drums . He must have been eleven or twelve years old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not blind , was he ? Yvonne could n't tell  --  he seemed to be looking at the drums  --  seemed to be aware of them . One of the teachers , a black man , was standing in the aisle , hands on hips , a few yards away . Only drumming !  --  only a child , playing drums ! But how loud it was , how it made the old building shudder  --  still rather upsetting to Yvonne , who hated loud noises  --  and why did n't he stop , why did he keep pounding away ? Was he one of the retarded children ? But there was a queer flashing vitality to his eyes  --  a liveliness  --  cunning  --  He did not seem slow-witted and she could not see anythingdeformed about him , any physical hint of " Why does n't he stop ? " she whispered . She took a few steps forward . Her heart was going wildly . What skill , what anger , what superb noise ! The child had given himself up to the noise  --  tap-tap-tapping  --  a rattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and immediate  --  drumming like a solid , fluid roar  --  a pressure on the eardrums and the eyesp236and the surface of the face  --  a pressure on every part of the body  --  on the brain itself  --  a pressure hardly to be borne . She wanted to scream . She wanted to get to him , to stop him . The noise echoed everywhere in the small auditorium , bounced off the walls and ceiling . She went forward , but stopped . The noise was overwhelming . A child with skinny arms  --  yet his arms and hands flashed , the drumsticks flashed and melted and were blurred , like light . The cymbals sounded : then again the drums . There were three of them , each with its own distinct noise . No music to it , no discerniblerhythm  --  only noise . Sheer noise . The black boy was gleaming with sweat and pleasure . Tireless . His body moved , ducked , jerked ; both legs fairly danced . His head , which seemed large , slightly out of proportion to his thin body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grin !  --  and in the glaze of his sweat ! And he was tireless , tireless . His movements were even accelerating , as if he were approaching the peak of a sequence of music  --  a sequence of noises  --  too complex for Yvonne to comprehend , except with her body  --  now trembling , trembling helplessly  --  caught in the drumbeat and the rolling clamorous echoingsound that grew louder , steadily louder , always louder . The noise was in her eyeballs , even ; pulsing in her eyes , in her vision . She was blinded . She was deafened . The boy ignored her , ignored his audience . What did he care ! He did not care . He was superb , that utter absorption in the drums , that slack-mouthed grinning , the healthy gleam of perspiration  --  superb , unstoppable . Louder and louder and louder the drum-roll  --  and then the surprise of the cymbals  --  the fearful clash of the cymbals  --  then again the drums . A child 's face , yet fixed in an attitude of exquisite pain ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The forehead a mass of furrows . Hair dark , frizzy , gleaming with sweat or oil . Was he brain-damaged , like some of the others ? Blind ? Partly crippled , partly paralyzed ? Could n't he speak properly ? Breathe properly ? He was so much in control of himself , of what he did  --  and yet was n't something wrong with him , was n't it necessary that something be wrong with him ? And why would n't he stop ? And why did he ignore her and the others ? Yvonne 's lips parted . She must have been smiling , grinning . The lower half of her face went slack , limp . She wanted to laugh but could not . The child 's grin tightened : a double row of teeth , the jaws taut , cords in the neck prominent , straining . No , please . No ,  |p237no  . Do n't . Please . Too loud  --  too loud  --  And louder still , always louder  --  She could not bear it that the child 's eyes were half closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bear it , his arms whirling , his hands flashing  --  the drumsticks trailing light behind them  --  delicate filmy strands of light  --  thread-like , luminous  --  And the noise ! Always , always the noise . It was still increasing . She stared , had been staring so intensely that the boy 's face lost all color suddenly  --  became a negative of itself , a photograph negative  --  now pale , ghostly  --  grinning at her  --  eyes still half closed . Somethingis going to happen , something is already happening , can you feel it happening ?  --  now ? She must have been standing there , paralyzed . She could not remember what had brought her here  --  who had escorted her  --  who had tricked her into this . The child on stage , the black child whose head sank and bounced and rolled  --  she did not know him  --  could not remember  --  his soul was pushingthrough his body  --  animating the entire body  --  the arms , the jerking legs , the drumsticks held so lightly by the fingers  --  even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drums themselves  --  and the sharp frightening clash of the cymbals  --  the vibrations everywhere , now beating against her  --  clamoring  --  pushingShe fainted . She faints . The widow , not yet a widow . She shrieks in dismay , her hands leaping to her face , to her eyes . Must she cover her eyes ? But they are ' blind  --  blinded . She recovers , drags herself away . Like an animal she drags herselfaway . And then considers : What does this mean ? What can this possibly mean ? Must resist ; must not give in . That day at the school  --  that ugly , smelly , depressing place  --  forgot the name  --  Dutch name ?  --  no matter : forgot  --  that day she fainted , staggered and fainted , must have fallen to the floor while everyone gaped . But why ? What did it mean ? Her mind must fight free of the squalor that surrounds her  --  must gain distance , time , cunning . Must resist , must not give in . Must know.  |p238A  reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chaos : insanity . The noise was both outside and inside , a terrific pressure . Beatingagainst her eardrums , her eyes , every inch of her face , every inch of her body . Hideous ! She tried to resist , tried to break away , but could not . Paralyzed . The noise  --  it must mean something  --  it must mean something and she would grasp its meaning  --  would not be defeated by it . Music ? Was it music ? Was there a rhythmic pattern to it ? Violent pounding  --  sheer pounding  --  hideous  --  maddening . Was that the only meaning of the noise , that it existed ? That it would never end ? Building and building in a crescendo , building to a climax , yet never ending ? She was sick , sickened  --  she had gone blind  --  had been deafened by the noise for some time without knowing it  --  and still the noise reached upward , acceleratingall the while  --  an infinity ahead , behind  --  on all sidesAn infinityShe would run to where he was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would beg him to abandon the work he was now doing  --  would beg him to return to her  --  to the world  --  before it was too late and everything was changed  --  She would beg as she never did , she would plead and weep and scream at him as she never didShe fainted . They must have helped her , must have helped her to her feet , must have pitied her , fussed over her , gaped at her . Must have touched her , handled her . She fainted , she fell heavily to the floor . They did n't have time to catch her  --  were taken by surprise . So she fell to the floor , in a faint . And they must have helped her afterward . But she could not remember any details . Funeral services were held at St. Aidan 's Episcopal Church on Otway Boulevard , at eleven o'clock , June i8 , a weekday morning . The church was crowded , as the funeral parlor had been crowded ; police formed a line to keep curious spectators back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in the street and wept andp239waved at cameras and members of the family when they entered the church , and again when they left to get into the limousines . There were a few picket signs : How Many Must Die Before the Traitors Are Exposed , Free Captive Nations of the World , RestoreDeath Penalty for Commie Killers . Everything went well . There were no unpleasant surprises . One of the state police helicopters developed engine trouble while following the procession to the cemetery and had to land suddenly in the parking lot of a shopping mall  --  but no one was hurt , nothing serious happened . A large , solemn , and essentially uneventful funeral , in sharp contrast to Andrew Petrie 's turbulent life and most particularly his violent death , one of the innumerable commentators noted . Skillfully handled , the security measures especially , and a very shocked and grim occasion , of course  --  the widow closely guarded , as was the entire Petrie family  --  essentially uneventful  --  in spite of the publicity  --  but a genuinely happy note in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even sunny but more what we should be getting at this time of year , temperatures in the high 6o 's and no rain as was predicted ... . 5One of them stood before her in a charcoal gray suit with a vest of lighter gray , a necktie broad and knotted like a fist , and his mouth knotted too , glowering and dense with humiliation . The white shirt was too white . It suggested another era . The black shoes were too black , too polished , like a dancer 's shoes . What are the proper costumes for mourning ? She was dressed in something that would not offend anyone , she could not remember exactly what it was  --  they had helped her with it , had helped her with the sleeves , the zipper  --  steadying her as she shook her hair free . The difficulty with her left hand , the thick clotted bandages . She had not wanted them changed . She had not wanted the hand treated . A small wound , nothing serious , very little danger of infection  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a pair of scissors she 'd found in the farmhouse kitchen while awaiting the ambulance and the police . No , she did n't want the bandagesp240changed , she could take care of herself  --  she wanted no attention for herself  --  she wanted them only to leave her alone. "  --  What you should do , Yvonne , is send the bill directly to Fritz ; do n't pay a penny until he advises you . " One of them in his tight-fitting mourner 's costume , like a bridegroom , trying to light a cigarette . His hands trembled badly . Was he next , was he going to die next ? Speaking softly to the widow , sorrow gathered in pockets beneath his eyes , like rain pockets , bluish-violet , bruised . How terrible , terrible . Had n't slept since then  --  since the news of it . Had been going to meet with Andrew on Thursday  --  day after tomorrow  --  not simply business but many other matters to catch up on  --  had known him so long , so many years . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party : held in a chilly vaulted place , the size of a ballroom . Pilasters reaching to the high , high ceiling , absurdly ornamentalat their bases . Chandeliers . Banks of flowers . Low-pitched voices and gestures that were subdued , held close to the body . Yvonne moved away from people who touched her , shrank away from a chattery middle-aged woman  --  her sister-in-law  --  and might have insulted her unwittingly . She wanted only to be left alone . " What a terrible , terrible thing , " someone whispered . Her hands were seized . She winced , drew her left hand away . " A terrible thing .... " The breath a fierce brandyish emission , the eyes red-veined and shifting . She knew the man , did not know the man , could not recall the name . She forced herself to be courteous , to listen to his grief . " You know who did this ... ? You know ... ? " Whispering in a hoarse stagy voice , wanting perhaps to embrace her  --  but she stepped back , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leon or Charles or one of the others rescued her . " Terrible , terrible thing ! ... But our enemies will pay for it ! " Yvonne smiled angrily . Our enemies will pay . Though she was drugged , though the doctor had insisted upon drugging her , only her body was numb and ungainly . Her mind worked as always . Worked beautifully as always . Their enemies would pay . His enemies . The ones who had killed him  --  who had arranged for him to be killed . They would pay for it , for this humiliation . They would be discovered and would pay.  |p241This  terrible , terrible thing , people murmured ; wondering at her , dreading to look into her face . She was a stranger , really . She was the man 's wife , he had married her  --  secretly , but officially  --  it was a legitimate union  --  but they did not know her , did not care about her . Except the fact of her widowhood , her grief . They dreaded to look into her face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly and angrily it was out of her hearing , at the periphery of the crowd . But she was not staggering with grief , she was not broken , demolished . She was angry . Her mind worked as usual , her level shrewd gaze moved from person to person , from face to face , workingits way through the crowd  --  while whoever stood beside her offered condolences and sighed and spoke of the weather , or the beautiful floral arrangements , or the fact that the Governor of the state seemed so genuinely moved  --  how ironic , what a surprise , had he and Andrew become reconciled without anyone know-ing  --  ? Yes , they would pay . His enemies . Their enemies . Whoever : whoever had killed him . They would pay , they would be discovered and would be exposed and would pay for it , possibly even with their lives  --  that would depend upon the circumstances  --  upon who they were , how they were apprehended . " The bastards . The cowards , " Yvonne whispered . " Yes ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her body was ill-coordinated . Her arms were too slack , too heavy to tremble . Even her eyelids drooped  --  what effort it took to stay awake ! But her mind worked swiftly and beautifully as always , as if shock-protected , like one of Andrew 's expensive watches . And then in church , in that dark , quaint old church : her brain alert , wondrously aware . She knew people were watching her , she knew they were recording her  --  but how contemptible it was , their pity ! She did not care for it , did not need it . The mumblings of strangers . That someone should grip her familiarly by the arm , help her with her coat  --  these insufferable , maddening rituals ! One of Andrew 's brothers on her left , another on her right . Protectedby them , by two men . She had no use for them at all . She had met the minister , the old man , only the day before She had liked him well enough . The unctuous gravity of his voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in this church surprisingly effective . Ofp242course it was all ritual  --  theatrical  --  the Biblical incantations  --  the way certain words rang and echoed and drew tears . She glanced at the casket and away again . That did not matter . Not that . They had killed him  --  had tried to stop him by killing him . But it would not be so easy . It was never that easy . They would see . Flickering candlelight . White marble smooth as glass . Carved words and dates  --  the figure of Christ in quiet , chaste colors , one hand upraised as if in caution  --  the interior of the church shadowy , rather chill . He had disliked churches or had been indifferent to them and so was she , but it was necessary to endure this masquerade , as he had endured similar masquerades in his lifetime , without complaint . He had been stoical , brave . His enemies did not know how brave . They did not know her either , they had surely underestimated her . Let us pray : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dry-eyed , open-eyed . Watching the altar , the minister , the way the dark casket gleamed , as if highly charged with energy . Beside her , the younger brother hid his face  --  bending suddenly forward as if stricken with pain or grief  --  hiding his face in his hands  --  and she dreaded his sobbing , his breaking down . He was a stranger to her , she did not know him and had no connection with him ; Andrew had disliked him intensely . They had argued once , in her hearing . And afterward Andrew had been upset , had kept to himselfthe rest of the day . . . . The other brother , Hugh , seemed embarrassedin her presence . Would not meet her eye . His remarks were difficult to comprehend , allusive and ironic and not very clearly articulated , so that she felt he wanted only to escape : to get through this ritual , as she did , and to escape . Restrained , distant , civil . Obviously quite intelligent . Andrew had spoken of him rarely , always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the matter of the money he had borrowed  --  six thousand dollars over a period of years  --  that Andrew assumed would never be repaid . But Hugh did not know that Yvonne knew , and she did not intend to embarrass him . That cold , uneasy , rather reptilian look of his !  --  the gaze never quite meeting hers , but slidingaway , shifting away , his aversion for her disguised as courtesy . Still she was dry-eyed . Let the others pray . She was enumeratingp243his enemies : in her mind 's eye making a list . She would type it up later . She would make a primary list and a secondary list . She would hand over to the investigators only the material that seemed to her really significant ; otherwise , they might dissipate their energies , might follow too many leads . They would have to be directed . She knew the imaginations of bureaucrats , how limitedtheir powers of speculation , how disappointing , always , their intelligence . Once , not long after their marriage , Andrew had told her  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his , then presumably running for the Presidency , registered in the Florida primary  --  The average person , and even the above-average person , is n't guided by a desire to be excellent , or even to be triumphant : he simply does n't want to fail . He does n't want to fail in public . He does n't want to be exposed . He does n't want to be laughed at . She knew he was right . The fear of ridicule was stronger than any desire to excel . It was an American secret , the underside of the mythological American dream of success . " The cowards , killing him like that , " she whispered . " . . . bas-tards . " Waiting for the ambulance and the police , she had felt the numbness in her hand again  --  the very tips of the fingers tingling , as if she had brushed them lightly against a heated burner . It would drive her insane , that feeling ! . . . so she found herself stabbingwith the scissors , trying to stab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that was better ! That , and that ! To feel pain , to feel it darting up her arm !  --  the sight of her own blood , so much better than that paralysis ! Afterward , of course , she had been stricken with shame . There was no explanation . She could not explain . The doctor treated her for shock and cleansed the wounds and bandaged them , saying very little . She was ashamed , so ashamed . Her madnesscould not be explained and people would be talking about it , wondering at her , worrying . . . would she hurt herself further ? ... could she be trusted ? She assured them she was all right now . She was in no danger . At the cemetery : the rawness of daylight , the surprise of the actual grave . Pallbearers gloved and proper and rather absurd , try/ing not to pant with the weight of their archaic burden ; the minister , unsheltered by his stained glass and his altar railing and his incantations , rather absurd as well . Voice faltering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stiff , and felt herself poreless and perfect as glass . How long , how very long this ritual lasted ! .. . but she was not going to break . Suppose he had been calling for her as he died ... ? No : impossible . He had died at once . They said he had died at once . The bullets at such close range . . . . His murderer had surprised him and fired into his face at a distance of less than twelve inches . He died , died at once . Instantaneously . At once . He had not called her name .. . had not had time even to think of her . A helicopter ?  --  hovering at the edge of the cemetery , propellers pulsing , throbbing . Yvonne wanted to turn away . She wanted to scream at them to leave Andrew alone . Still the minister was talking . Still the service continued . He would not have wanted this : would have been humiliated by it . Let death be simple , direct , blunt , final . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not wanted a conventional funeral at all . But the family had protested . Had protested rather forcefully ; so Yvonne gave in . It was true that Andrew had not been very adamant about cremation , and nothing in his will stipulated it ; he had never given much thought to such matters . . . alwaystoo absorbed in the present , in his work , in life . It would have been embarrassing for him to leave detailed instructions concerning his death and funeral arrangements ; that was n't Andrew 's nature . So Yvonne had yielded to the family , had not wanted to fight them at this time . Perhaps that was a point in her favor , something they would remember . Then something extraordinary happened : Hugh began to whimper . He was pressing both hands against his mouth , making a high , whimpering , whinnying noise . His glasses were crooked . His knees were visibly trembling . He staggered forward and one of the men caught him . For a moment it looked as if he would collapse . Yvonne felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the loss of control  --  thep245breakdown  --  For a moment she too was stricken . She turned aside dizzily . But no . No . She was stronger than Hugh . She was not going to collapse in public . The muffled sounds of the man 's anguish repulsed her ; she turned away . She was not going to collapse . She was strong , stronger than anyone knew . " Are you  --  ? " She had groped for someone , had unconsciously laid her hand on someone 's arm . It was Stephen ; he believed mistakenly that she needed help . Yvonne ? Are you all right ? He gripped her arm . His voice was a murmur , his manner awkward , shy . As always he was clumsy . She drew away from him , shaking her head slightly , irritably . She did not want his help . She did not require anyone 's help . On the other side of the grave Hugh was sobbing wildly ; his relatives clustered about him , helpless . But grateful , perhaps , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than glance at Stephen . " Yvonne  --  ? " But she was herself again , in control . The ceremony came to an end . The funeral was over . Fritz Sanderson , her attorney , studied the list of names . He did not speak for some time . At the funeral the other day he had looked pale and startled and fragile , especially about the eyes ; now he looked merely ravaged , and older than his fifty years . On his left wrist was a complicated watch , like one of Andrew 's  --  a chronograph  --  inwhat was probably a platinum bracelet , thick and chunky . Finally he passed his hand over his eyes , and Yvonne knew what he would say . She said , before he could speak , that she had photostated copies of certain documents and letters  --  she had them with her , right here  --  would he like to examine them ? " There are thousands of documents , " he said . " There are thousandsof letters .  --  Thousands of enemies . " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorney Gen-eral ? " " One of them is the Attorney General 's brother-in-law . "  | " I know that , " Yvonne said . " What 's wrong ?  --  I know that . " " Do what you will , " Sanderson said . He lay the typed sheet on the desk between them . Yvonne hesitated , then picked it up . " Andrew always said he was hated more by his friends than by  --  than by the others . He always said  --  " " But there were so many things he always said .... " Sanderson said weakly . Tiny white dots . Suddenly they appear . They are alive , seething with life . Like snowflakes , so tiny  --  but living , near-microscopic pinpoints of motion , of life . The widow begins to scream . Tramping in the woods . Mountains  --  early spring  --  the world not yet awakened  --  everything neutral , somber , except the pines and the bright hard red berries and a few tentative leaves . It is early spring , it is a mute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rocky Mountains . No , the Adirondacks ; Mt . Invemere prominent to the north ; this is her husband 's property , thousands of acres , the old farm and the boarded-up lodge and the cabin by the river . To the left , obscured by mist or low-lying clouds , is Royal Mountain . She knows were she is , knows what she is doing . Her mind racing as always . Charging now this way , now that . No , it is not Colorado : it is not a girl but a woman , not a child but a widow . A wife . She is a wife still . She has driven out from Albany to be with him , has been worried about him , will spend the weekend here . But he is harassed . He has little time for her . Polite , yes  --  expressing gratitude for her company  --  surprise that she should bother , driving to this ill-heated place she dislikes so much , especially when he will be back home by Monday afternoon . Perhaps he is baffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some emotional response , a kind of blackmail uncharacteristicof her . But he is harassed with his own work , he really has no time for her , and of course she understands . He did n't even bother with meals , he told her . Not when hep247was working . Just ate where he was  --  camped out by the river  --  ate at his desk , mostly sandwiches . No need for her to cook , to fuss over him . She understood . His mind was crammed with so many ideas , so many hypotheses  --  almost , at times , he felt he was going mad  --  or on the verge of an extraordinary insight . Did she understand ? He had so little time these days  --  the hours raced when he was alone like this  --  he could n't write his ideas down fast enough , they came in such a rush sometimes  --  and how would he synthesize these new ideas with the material he already had  --  those hundreds of pages of  --  those thousands of pages of  --  twenty years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in jeans and boots and a coarse-knit sweater , trampingthrough the old pastureland , through the old orchards . She understands , yet does not understand . Her hair is loose ; it blows into her eyes . She stares at the ground before her , brooding , talking to herself , unaware of her surroundings . Where is she ? In the mountains ? But why ? And why is her breath steamy , if it is May now and no longer winter ? She hears her own voice , questioning , she wonders for a moment if it is Andrew she hears  --  he too talks to himself occasionally , rehearsing things he will say in public . Structure  --  rhythm  --  style : of the utmost importance . It is not enough to be correct , one must also appear to be correct . Unconsciously she begins to walk faster . Her mind races , yet she is not really thinking about anything . Something is going to happen  --  or has it already happened ? She does not intend to tell him about the incident at the handicapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her legs suddenly , and evidently lost consciousness as well for a few seconds and had to be helped . She does not intend to tell him any of this . In fact , what is there to tell ? There is nothing , nothing to tell . Nothing to explain . He judges his own failings harshly and he would judge hers harshly , if he could know . She is staring at something  --  something that lies at the edge of a field . As she approaches it , she sees that it is  --  what is it , that shape ?  --  too small , too flattened  --  a piece of cardboard , perhaps  --  a piece of tar paper  --  yet she can not come any closer , she stops , drawing her hands out of her pockets , raising her shoulders , slightlyp248hunched , staring : no , it is not a dead thing , not the corpse of a small animal , it is nothing to shrink from , nothing to make her gag . A piece of tar paper . It is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an animal 's corpse , not a dead rabbit teeming with maggots  --  no : it is not the wilderness of her childhood , it is not Colorado , not White Springs , but another world completely , anotherlifetime . She is his wife , not yet his widow . She is an adult . At the edge of the field something lies partly rotted , crumpled ; but it is not a dead creature , it is nothing that will sicken and terrify her . Still , she circles it . She stares , she will not come any closer . There is a broken wall , an old stone wall , crumbled at her feet . . . several steps and she is on the other side , panting , triumphant . She will return by way of the dirt road , she will avoid the thing that lies at the edge of the field , having dragged itself there to die . A dead rabbit , was it ? A dead raccoon ? She does n't know , she had to look away at once , gagging . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself screaming , but the scream is silent . Those tiny grubby dots , appearing so suddenly : why , they are alive , seething with life ! They can not see her , they have no awarenessof her , they are nothing of hers . They can not even by named . What does it mean , to call them maggots ? What does it mean , to turn aside , gagging , one 's face contorted ? Near-microscopic dots , mere pinpoints of motion , tough and living , alive . . . . What does it mean , even , to realize they are alive ? Not long after the body was discovered , not many hours after the widow came upon it , the first arrests were made .  --  But after the first sporadic arrests , after the hours of interrogation , suspectswere released and the dead man was still dead . Suddenly it was the day of the funeral . Then it was the afternoon and the evening of the day of the funeral . Then it was the following weekend , and already the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead man was still dead , and the murderer not yet apprehended . " Is there anything we can do for you ? " people asked . " I 'm not ill , " she said . She smiled , to soften her manner.  | " But is there anything we can do ... ? " She stared at them . Theoretically she was under sedation ; her body seemed to be grieving , in a nagging , embarrassing manner  --  as if she had a mild case of intestinal flu ; but in fact she was very much herself , in full consciousness , alert and wary . " How do I know ? How can I answer that question ? How do I know what you can do , how much you can help me if you wanted to ? " she said in her rapid , light voice . " That was when it sank home ... how awful , awful it would be ... alone in the apartment without anyone to talk to ... day after day after day . . . . I realized he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't find him . My sister , you know , who died last winter ... well , she was seventy-six ... she died last winter , we had been living together for about fifteen years , she came to live with me after her husband died . . . the thing is , he belonged to her originally and I did n't like him that much that I was aware of but now he 's gone I do n't have the heart to get another one , it 's just too sad and such a drain on the spirit when something goes wrong . I had to go to the hospital for a checkup , you know , the last week of May . It was supposed to be a week but was actually twelve days . He was at the kennel all that time , I hated to put him in that noisy impersonal place , and there 's no guarantee they really give the pets exercise  --  there 's a runway , but how do you know they use it ?  --  how could you actually know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred dollars  --  I hated to take him there but I had no choice . . . . As soon as we were both home again , I knew something was strange . He seemed like a different animal , that 's all . A big gray tom , he was , not a pedigree or anythingspecial , but he could be quite affectionate when the spirit moved him , and he and I had always gotten along ; but after the kennel , after those twelve days at the kennel , he just was n't the same animal . He was n't . It was all changed , all different , he refused to sit on my lap and Ile would n't eat his favorite foods , not even liver or seafood biscuits , and when I tried to pet him he just slinked away , sort of crouched down and scurried away as if he hated to be touched . It was so sad ! It was the strangest thing ! He went for the door though he had never been allowed outside in his life . He always went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scolded him , I tried to spank him  --  you know , patting him on thep250nose , not hard , just to discipline him  --  and he hissed and spat at me and even swiped at me with his paw  --  it was so exasperating and sad  --  it was just such a mystery . He had no claws , you know ; Margaret had him declawed as a kitten . But he tried to get out anyway , one day I discovered him at the bedroom window , and he had the screen almost loose , and that should have warned me but I fed him and petted him and it seemed maybe he would settle down somewhat , but then it was the next day  --  or the day after that  --  when I came home from my hair appointment he was n't around , did n't rush for the door when I unlocked it , and I thought maybe he was asleep under the bed  --  that was one of his places , all his life  --  sometimes he would sleep there all day long , practically  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , to bend over far enough to look under the bed  --  so it was Tuesday night by the time I realized he was n't in the apartment and so much time had been lost , so much precious time .... It turned out to be the bathroom window , the screen was loose just a bit and he had forced it , had squeezed out the bottom and then the screen clapped back , so you could n't see how he had gotten out exactly unless you examined it very closely and then you could see the gray fur at the bottom , that bad cat ! He must have forced his way out , must have pushed and pushed , and what strength he must have had , it 's a wonder he did n't hurt himself .... If only I had checked that particular window , that particular screen , but it always seemed safe to me and Tommy ordinarily never went into the bathroom because I keep the door shut but evidently he had forced that door open too , just by pushing and clawing , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning paper and alerted the superintendent and both of us put notices on the bulletinboard and on the bulletin board in the grocery store but it did n't do any good , he just disappeared , and I know he wo n't be back , I just know I will never see him again .... " Yvonne listened without appearing to listen . She was at the Special Delivery window of the post office at Lake Placid , waiting in line . She had three letters to mail and had insisted upon taking them to the post office herself , though one of Adrienne Greason 's children could have brought them over . She listened to the voice just behind her , but did not allow herself to turn , to see who the speaker was . There were other voices , other conversations delivered with thatp251subdued passion , that sense of weighty certainty Yvonne had begun to notice in overheard conversations . She listened carefully , her expression impassive . She wore sunglasses with very dark lenses ; her hair was skimmed back from her face . Her poppy-colored sun dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white sash , had the pert , pleasing look of a costume  --  she was costumed today , a day in July , as an attractive young woman . At other times she dressed like an attractive young widow , in dark colors . On the whole she preferred the dark colors , the sobriety of mourning ; but she was able to eavesdrop more easily in an outfit like the poppycoloreddress . Earlier , she had overheard on a telephone call Adrienne was making to a friend " . . . terribly hot back in Albany Leon says , he just called a minute ago , temperature in the nineties and very muggy ... what ? ... oh yes ! ... the Fourth of July festival is very nice very nice as usual , the children always love it fireworks of course and a sailboat regatta and why do n't you come over for drinks then dinner , yes she is , she is , though it 's possible she wo n't come down for cocktails because she 's very ... not at all ! no ! not at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... Yes , isn'tit ! Was n't it ! And what if .... " Before leaving the post office she overheard two postmen talking . They were a few yards away , separated from her by an opaque green plastic partition . " ... that son of a bitch , would you believe it ? ... saw it from the basement window , I mean I saw it ... a good three feet on one side , maybe more , and he backs the truck in practically sideways and of course there was a long scratch .... That son of a bitch ! " On the steps of the post office , in the sudden sunshine , the widow feels dizzy for a moment : sees something dark and shapelessbefore her , then suddenly pinpricked by white , a seething clamorous white . She remembers a remark of Andrew 's , made to someone else in her presence . A philosophical discussion . What was equality ? What did it mean ? Had anyone ever analyzed the concept ? It was hideous ! Loathsome ! Like William James I considermyself a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom he quoted in a spirit of objectivity , I find this empiricism a nightmare . . . too atomistic to be tolerated . It 's hideous ! " Like a sea of maggots on a carrion " ... or whatever that expression is .... My public beliefs , then , are a matter of choice : I assert my faith in ap252hierarchy of . . . . I defeat my own metaphysics by an act of sheer ... . Of what ? Of  --  ? She was stricken suddenly by the memory of his voice : the manner , the tone , the courteous precision of the words : I defeat my own metaphysics by an act of sheer .... Standing in the brilliant sunshine , suddenly dizzy , saddened , weighed down by the slight sickness of her body , which lingered and would not be defeated , she realized it was some time now since his death : no longer hours or days but weeks , solid blocks of time that were weeks , countable in weeks . He was dead . Permanently dead . If she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination , and she could not directher imagination , could not will it to re-create him  --  she could not force it  --  was helplessI defeat my own metaphysics by an act of sheerOf will . She told Adrienne she must leave , could not stay any longer at their lakeside house ; she must leave , she had work to do , she had to return to Albany in order to do it . " Do n't argue ! Please ! You 've been very kind , " she said . " ... very kind , Andrew would be ... would be so grateful .... Your friendshipmeant ... means . . .. But do n't argue , please ! I must go home . " They did not speak to her directly . They watched her , they addressed her by name  --  occasionally Mrs. Petrie , occasionally Yvonne  --  they spoke in her presence , spoke at her . But not directly . Not to her . Not to anyone she recognized as herself . The Petries who clustered around her and the friends , Andrew 's friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not speak to her , not directly . There was another woman , another ghostly image , whom they addressed by her name . Of course she had always been something of an eavesdropper , a spy , an impostor : but in the past she had controlled the degree and the duration of her imposture.  |p253The  Police Commissioner was one of them . He spoke in her presence for many minutes , late one afternoon . Mrs. Petrie , he called her ; and Yvonne . His manner was superficially apologetic . Beneath , always close beneath , was the belligerence she had formerlyadmired , knowing him as a friend of her husband 's . He spoke for some time , not giving her a chance to interrupt , presentingher with a small , richly detailed speech . . . as if he were offering her information that had nothing to do with either of lhcm , or with Andrew , but was the sort of information one might offer to the public . The gun had been found : tossed into a few feet of water , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Special , absolutelyclean , untraceable . There were many suspects , and they were waiting for informers and other contacts to come forward .. . which might not be for a while , for various reasons ... and though at the moment they had nothing strong to go on , nothing very convincing to work with , he was confident the people responsible would soon be located . In the meantime it might be a good idea for her to leave town , to take a vacation somewhere , to visit with her family . Why had she left the Greasons ? Mrs. Greason had telephoned his office , had been worried about her ; why had she left Lake Placid so suddenly ? He had had the idea she would be staying there most of the summer . " I wanted to leave , " Yvonne said . " I was bored there . " " It night have been a better idea to  --  " " I wanted to come back to Albany . " " Yes , but  --  " " I wanted to be home . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ? " " No. " "  --  your home ? " " My home is here . " He reddened slightly . She knew she had offended him with her tone of voice . Yet she went on , speaking as Andrew would have spoken : " Why do n't you want me here ? You do n't think I 'm in danger , do you ? Why ? Why would I be in danger ? ... I'rn not in danger . I 'm not important . I do n't mind you telling lies to the newspapers or to one another , but please do n't lie to me . It 's like lying to Andrew himself . "  | " I 'm not lying . " " You 're not telling me everything , are you ? You 're not telling me everything . So in effect you 're lying . I have a right to know , I 'm his wife , he would want me to know everything .... When you talk to me like that , you 're insulting me , it 's like insulting him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I never lied to Andrew , " he said slowly . Both were silent , thinking he had lied to Andrew  --  had lied several times in the past year . He and a number of other police officials , as well as the Governor 's office and the prison authority at Glasberg , had lied . " I never lie , " he said . He was addressing another person  --  someone who sat where Yvonne sat . " You never lie , " Yvonne repeated . It was surprising , how weak her voice sounded . She had the flu now  --  or a very bad , lingering cold  --  she supposed it was an actual disease , a minor illness that really had no connection with the death . Her voice sounded faint , remote , a little nasal . " But so many details , so many facts , such a listing of names  --  of suspects '  --  and that nonsense about the things stolen , as if anyone for a moment could take that theory seriously !  --  that it was robbery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  taking so long to tell me about that , as if I did n't already know  --  do you think I 'm a newspaper reporter , that you must smother me with these misleading little facts , these lying truths ? And you do n't even seem to be talking to me . What 's wrong ? Why are you like this ? Talk to me , look at me . " He rose from behind his desk . " Mrs. Petrie , are you ill ? " " What ? Why ? Why do you say that ? " " You sound a little hysterical . " He stared at her as if seeing her for the first time . She saw the alarm in his face  --  the sudden fright . " I 'm not sick , " Yvonne said irritably . " Do n't touch me , please . " He went past her , went to the door . Called to his secretary inthe same scared , vexed voice . " ... is n't feeling well , if you couldbring her some water .... Could you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yvonne stood . " I 'm not sick ! " she said . " You wo n't listen to me , you want to  --  want to discredit me  --  Why am I hysterical ?  |p255You  were n't even talking to me , not to me ! You were lying to me ! It 's a game , a pretense , you 're taping this conversation and  --  Trying to trap me , are you trying to trap me ? Me ? It 's like lying to Andrew himself , insulting Andrew himself  --  " " Yvonne , please  --  " " What do you mean ? Do n't touch me ! I know you do n't want nic around  --  you 're afraid they will get to me too and you 'll be embarrassed in public  --  my safety is n't important to you otherwise , is it ?  --  is it ? You and your friends betrayed Andrew  --  he would never have taken such an extreme stand about the Glasbergriot  --  " " I was betrayed , " he said , " I was told lies  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please , " Yvonne said quickly , " I ca n't stand that  --  it makes me nervous , I  --  I ca n't stand it  --  You would never have dared interrupt Andrew  --  You betrayed him , you lied to him  --  if you did n't lie to him you withheld information , your office withheld information , I know why you kept it from the newspapers but  --  but  --  Your responsibility to Andrew was  --  You were friends , you had been friends  --  He was one of you  --  Now I ca n't believe anything you say and  --  " " Yvonne  --  " " You would probably be relieved if something did happen to me  --  it would make everything easier  --  except it would  --  there would be  --  you and your office would be embarrassed  --  " " That 's ridiculous , " he said sharply . " You know that 's ridiculous . I warned Andrew after that Glasberg publicity  --  I warned him there were threats reported against his life  --  informers called in  --  I warned him years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he always said afterward that I had been an alarmist , taking these maniacs seriously , and it never mattered whether one of them actually did show up  --  as they did , you know , fairly of ten  --  and once , in Buffalo , Andrew was nearly killed  --  it never mattered to Andrew because the mere fact that he was still alive was a sufficientargument in his mind that I 'd been an alarmist . So he brushed it all aside , he took it lightly , he thought there was a kind of bullet-proof aura around him  --  " " That is n't true , " Yvonne said . " You 're distorting everything . You sit in this office and refashion what happened and tell the newspapers grotesque things and lie to me , to my face  --  as if you could lie to me about my own husband  --  "  | " I knew Andrew for more than seventeen years  --  " " This bullet-proof image , this bullet-proof lie  --  **25;1793;TOOLONG expression was in one of the news articles  --  I suppose you were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotly . " The comment was made by an unidentified person  --  I do n't happen to know who it was  --  but it was common knowledge that  --  " " Bullet-proof ! " Yvonne said . " You deliberately gave the reportersthat grotesque insane expression  --  you deliberately leaked it  --  to make your own position seem less responsible  --  to make people think he was insane and brought what happened on himself . I know what you 're like , I know what the police are like , but you were a friend of his and  --  You betrayed him and you 're betraying him even now  --  You  --  You deliberately  --  " " Stand next to me ; I 'm bullet-proof , " he said . " I swear to you that Andrew was known to have  --  " " He was quoting someone else ! He was mocking whover it was ! I know very well  --  I remember it very clearly  --  that was misreportedtoo  --  whenever he gave a public address the newspapers distorted it , they singled out phrases for headlines and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and  --  they missed him  --  they always missed him  --  People who listened closely to him were never mistaken , they always knew what he meant , and anyone who has read his essays knows  --  anyone who takes thej time to examine  --  He  --  It was one of his jokes  --  He was mockingthe man who had said that  --  I do n't remember who  --  you are deliberately confusing me  --  but  --  but I remember that talk , I was in the audience , it was in Washington  --  Georgetown University  --  hewas citing that remark as an example of  --  of  --  I think he was alluding in a way to John Kennedy , who did n't allow himself to be protected well enough  --  but I do n't think Kennedy was the man who  --  " " Yvonne , it does n't matter , the fact is the remark was attributed to Andrew and even if it did n't originate with him it did express his feeling  --  in a way it expressed his feeling , his unconscious  --  " " It certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark was the very antithesis of Andrew  --  of Andrew 's sanity  --  and the reason he made it , the reason he cited it , was to point out that certain men in high positions  --  like Presidents  --  especially Presidents  --  he was n't referring just to Kennedy but to all of them , to any ofp257them- These men , they become megalomaniacs  --  they forget they are human  --  the point of Andrew 's talk was just that , I remember it , I was there , you were n't there and you 're distorting everything and you lie to the papers and to one another and if he only knew  --  if he could only know  --  And you 're fundamentally stupid : that 's the problem . He never recognized how very stupid you people are . lie knew lie was surrounded by inferiors and he knew they were n't just the rednecks and the Imperial Grand Wizards and the  --  what do they call themselves  --  the White Guard  --  the Minutemen  --  he knew it was n't just those nien but men close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplified and reduced to  --  to idiotic racist nonsense  --  but he did n't know how great the differencewas  --  he really did n't know  --  he was so loyal to the old families , to the past , to his friends  --  he would n't criticize except to me  --  he was so Ioyal  --  And now you are all betraying him by suggestingthat  --  " " Nobody is betraying Andrew Petrie , " he said . " You have no idea how shocked and angry and  --  and how hard I 've been working  --  You have no idea , Yvonne , you have no right to use that term  --  " " I 'm not Yvonne to you , " she said . He was silent . When she went to leave he said quietly : " Then you 're not Yvonne . All right . Fine . But Mrs. Petrie , my Mrs. Petrie , the Mrs. Petrie I assume when I hear that term  --  Mrs. Petrie to some of us  --  is not you but another woman . If you do n't want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yvonne said . Someone telephoned . A stranger telephoned though she had a private number . " Hello hello hello ... ? " the voice begged . She said nothing . She listened to the breathy panicked voice . Gradually she realized it was her brother-in-law , Hugh . He was telephoning from New York but he seemed close , as if a block away or in the next room , jarringly intimate . She listened to him chatter and felt a surge of pity for him and spoke to him , reluctantly , at first noncommittal about who she was : was she Yvonne herself , or someone merely attending the telephone ? She could have been one of Andrew 's former secretaries or one of the Petrie family or a maid or a typist or an acquaintance of Yvonne 's answer/ing the phone because Yvonne was out of the room or out of the city . " Hello , hello , " the voice begged , " Yvonne . . . ? " She was tempted to hang up . But she did not . She replied to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thinking still of what the Police Commissioner had said of how she might take revenge upon Hugh , knowing it was hopeless and she would never be capable of revenge or even of hurting or disturbing or insulting him . . . his cruel clever voice gave way to his chirrupy breathless pathetic voice and she felt pity for him , almost a sense of relief , of affection . He was not cruel ; he seemed to be pleading with her . He was not cold and hateful and in control , like the others ; he was meek as a child . Still , she was puzzled . She did not know why he was talking to her so earnestly . Could he take a train up , could he visit ? Could they meet for lunch or at least for drinks ? Somewhere ? Anywhere ? At her convenience ? . . . Gradually she realized that he too was not speaking to her . Not to her . She told him it was n't possible . It was n't possible for them to meet . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... None of them spoke to her , not to her . They did not see her . She was invisible . She did not exist . Had never existed . There was a phantom in her place , a near-transparent being or creature . She watched this creature and she watched and listened to the others in the creature 's presence and felt only a dim , sullen contempt for the masquerade . They forced this imposture upon her . She had not chosen it . She was spying upon her own life and upon them . Where was her life , her self ? . . . they had torn her out of it , had ripped her inside out . They had begun their work years ago , in fact . The bride herself had been effaced , defaced . Her face lost . It had begun then . It continued still . Someday they would kill her as they had killed Andrew : her face and body brutally assaulted . Torn inside out . Mangled . Mutilated . And then they would pretend grief and shock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had brought it upon herself , she had willed it , she had unconsciously ... . " What do you want ? " she interrupted . Suddenly she could not bear it , this masquerade . " Why are you calling ? " He could not speak . " I  --  I  --  As I said , I  --  " She wondered if it was about the six thousand dollars he owedp259Andrew . She wondered if he wanted to bring the conversation around to that topic but did n't dare and was waiting for her to suggest it. " ... is it about ... ? Something personal , financial . . . ? " she said . But how awkward ! . . . she regretted she had said anything . Andrewhad lent his brother a little more than six thousand dollars over a period of years , in uneven installments , at no interest rate ; he had told Yvonne that , to save Hugh 's pride , he had allowed Hugh to consider the sum a loan , but in reality , it was a gift  --  Hugh would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently in debt to others , to people who would not so easily forgive him . So it was a gift , it would have to be a gift . Certainly the man must know that by now  --  though perhaps his pride did not allow him to acknowledge it . He talked , he talked . Chattered . Yvonne listened and then stopped listening . There was something edgy about him , somethingshe did not like  --  did not trust  --  but he was harmless , Andrewhad always spoken of him as eccentric but " harmless "  --  so her mind detached itself from the conversation and she made plans of her own , worked at calculations of her own , envisioning in her imagination the list of primary suspects that was now quite lengthy , thirty-two names of people or organizations thatHugh was asking again if he might come to Albany to see her . She paused , as if seriously thinking . Finally she said , " No . That 's impossible . " I love you . I love you . So they said , so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know that do n't you ? . . . Know that do n't you ? Eavesdropping , she had overheard . Sometimes she overheard intentionally , sometimes unintentionally . She was innocent at times . At other times guilty . I love you . Do n't hurt me . ... I love you , does n't it make any difference ? Her mother : the blond , feathery-blond hair , the slightly flattened but attractive features , that habit of smiling too quickly and thenp260allowing her smile to slowly retreat , fade . The strength in her arms and hands that always surprised Yvonne . A short , delicately boned woman , but always quick  --  marvelously quick . I love you . Does n't it make any difference ? Sometimes whimpering , self-pitying . Sometimesangry . Did it make any difference ? Her father : tall , abrupt , good-natured when sober and irritable when not . A mineworker in Wyoming and Colorado before Yvonne 's birth . Then he became a deputy sheriff in White Springs , in northern Colorado ; he died when Yvonne was eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the parents . Yvonne remembered the flashes of rage , the quarrels , the thumps and thuds and tears  --  she remembered the quick , close , tense atmosphere of the house  --  even when he left , when he walked out , the house was filled with him , with her mother 's thoughts of him . They had loved each other very much . So they said : and so others said of them . Yvonne had not thought about it , being too young . She had been too young to doubt . And what difference had it made ? It was true , probably , that the Radeks were very much in love . They were both young , youthful in manner  --  almost childlike , at times  --  hot-headed , impulsive , eager to hurt and to be hurt . Yvonne had thought all mothers and fathers were like hers , so noisily passionate , so quick to take offense and to forgive . Her father in his soiled uniform , pulling off his boots  --  her mother scolding him  --  the exchange of lazy insults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised voices . Often her mother 's wrists were bruised . He liked to catch her by the wrist , turn her small , fragile hand in his own , he liked to force her to cry out , to submit . Once , during the winter , she bloodied his nose  --  Yvonne remembered the dribbling bloodspots on the kitchen floor and on the fresh snow out in the drive  --  remembered the uproar that followed , though evidently it had been an accident , her slapping him . And of course he had forgiven her . They were playful , her parents . Not quite adults . Her father had died long ago , when still a young man . Not quite an adult , not quite a man . He had been brave  --  noisy  --  d goodnaturedand brave  --  everyone had been fond of him  --  and'his wife had gone a little mad when they came to tell her what happened  --   |p261how  he had died . Twenty-nine years old , and dead . Yvonne , now the age of her dead father , Yvonne now a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with detachment , unable to remember him . It had happened so long ago , so many years ago . It had happened to strangers , really . What connection was there ? She had told Andrew very little about her parents . She stressed the fact that they had loved each other very much  --  but what differencehad it made , that love ? He had died anyway . Had been killed anyway . Had not valued that love , not his wife 's or his own , really  --  had not allowed it to make much difference to him , to the care he had taken with his life . Afterward , because he had died while off duty  --  on a volunteer rescue mission on the Colorado River , one flooding April  --  the county had refused to pay the widow a full pension . Yvonne remembered her mother reading the letter aloud , to Yvonne 's grandmother , to neighbors , to Yvonne herself . She remembered being cornered and forced to hear that letter . She remembered her mother stressing certain words , certain sentences , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that .. . according to our records ... no provision made at the present time ... no coverage .... Her mother had not been drunk at that time , but she behaved drunkenly . Repeating the key words , the key sentences again and again . What did these words mean ? What was happening ? It could not be controlled , could it ?  --  what was happening to them ? Her father leaving the house on a Sunday ... missing that day , missing that night ... found dead , horribly mutilated , two days later .... One side of his face had been smashed . One arm nearly severed , both legs crushed to the knee . And a few weeks later the letter arrived , a message with an official stamp and official signature . Regret ... according to ... no provision ... no coverage .... Typed words in a letter . It could not be controlled , what was happening . It could not even be understood . If he had loved her and her mother , Yvonne told Andrew , he would not have died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was n't even an accident , really  --  he had been trying to rescue people past rescuing  --  a rancher and his family already dead , drowned  --  lost . He had tried to rescue people he could not have rescued . He had not listened to the others . The house had been demolished , the family already dead . A waste , an act of reckless/ness , of stupidity . People had called it heroic and the White Springs paper had called him a hero , along with two other volunteer workerswho were killed in the same flood ; there was a plaque in the courthouse square . But what did it mean , what difference did it make ? . . . The body broken , mangled , horrible . The body designatedheroic . Her husband had been very moved by the story . He had wanted to hear more . What had happened to her mother ? But she did not care to discuss it . Was her mother still living ? No . She was n't still living . The pension  --  ? Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pension had come through after all . The sheriff had liked him , had often gone drinking with him  --  so the county settled out of court , their attorney talked Yvonne 's mother into signing a release for a certainsum of money  --  not much , Yvonne guessed  --  and the money lasted a while , maybe a year . And then  --  ? She had not wanted to discuss her life . It was irrelevant , no more than an encumbrance , an embarrassment . Sometimes she lied , sometimes she said nothing when questioned too closely ; sometimes she made up facts , dates , probable events  --  her father killed in Korea , or in an explosion in a Montana mine . What difference did such things make , she asked wearily , sullenly , why must one be burdened with the past ... ? She had been struck by Andrew 's public statements concerning the essential shallowness of the merely subjective , personal life ; she knew , she knew he was correct , she knew . . . and she did not care to talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life is over , " Yvonne had said . Sometimes she slept in the bedroom , sometimes on the couch in Andrew 's study , once or twice she slept in the livng room , partly clothed , beneath a thin blanket . The apartment was very quiet . It was usually very quiet . Because it was summer and the legislaturep263was not meeting , the city itself was quiet , insignificant . It was not a " city , " really ; it did not exist as a city . Yvonne thought of it as a place she happened to be at the present . Had Andrew lived elsewhere , had he been born elsewhere , she would be somewhere else and that place also would not be significant in itself : but one must live locally , one must come to earth somewhere . So she kept the apartment , though everyone assumed she would give it up . She kept to the schedule she had had as his wife , with certain obvious exceptions . There was an answering service . But sometimes the telephone rang in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it  --  not out of timidity , but out of indifference . Who would be calling ? Who had anything to tell her ? When Andrew 's assassin was found , the news would not come over the telephone ; she was certainof that . They would send a policeman over , or perhaps a plainclothesman , they would break the news to her in person ... . The Police Commissioner himself would probably come over . He would tell her : We 've found them . We have them . It 's over . But days passed . Weeks . She went to the cemetery  --  stared at the grave  --  tried to think what connection this had with her , or with Andrew  --  what it could possibly mean . One lived in the present . One lived half in the future , in fact . Of course there was a partnershipbetween those who lived now , those who would live in the future , and those who had lived in the past  --  it was Burke , she believed , who had written so passionately on this subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a single essence , a unity : yet one lived in the present and the future , mainly . Andrew was always thinking ahead , planning ahead : next fall , next year , the next several issues of the magazine , and always the next elections , and the electionsafter that . Always the future , the future . He stared into it , yearned for it , as if there , there , the world he desired was at last complete . And he himself vindicated , justified . Triumphant . It was the future , Yvonne thought suddenly , that would prove him correct : for the present could not endure as it was , it must collapse , fall in upon itself . It was bankrupt , a ruin . Yet it kept going on its own heavy , blind course  --  no energy , only momentum  --  every year more exposures of corruption  --  stupid , childish greed  --  piggishness , inexplicable in adult men except as a symptom of disease , the regression of a culture toward the primitive , toward death . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own way , at the point of breakdown , and yet not quite breaking down  --  for there was still enough wealth to keep these things going  --  a gigantic machine , self-justified , an end in itself , a government with no connection any longer to those it governed . Let the future come : it would prove Andrew right . Chaos would come again and , perhaps , out of that chaos something that was new and at the same time old , timeless , would arise . And his assassins would be discovered . She felt a sudden sensation of gloating , to know that they would be found . It was wrong to despair , it was far too soon , not even August yet . They would be found . She had been assured innumerable times that the authorities wanted nothing so much as to bring Andrew 's killers to justice  --  and even if one agency tried to hinder the investigation ( the state , for instance ) , another agency , a higher agency , would pursue it . But it might take time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient . As time passed she slept more often on the leather couch in the study . It had been Andrew 's bed at times ; he would work late , would sleep on the couch , not wanting to disturb her . Sometimes she found him there , before dawn , fully clothed , even his shoes on , a book or some papers on his chest , the floor lamp behind the couch still burning . Andrew ... ? Andrew ... ? She would whisper , not really wanting to wake him . He slept so heavily , his chest laboredto suck in air and expel it , as if a great weight were pressing against him . The study was a large cool room , facing the northeast . From one window Yvonne could see the Hudson River ; from a smaller window she could see only a few hundred yards , since the view was blocked by another high-rise apartment building , a newer buildingon the park . Yvonne sometimes stood at the big window , leaning her forehead against it . She had a grc.i deal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The river fascinated her . It meant nothing , it was the same every day , there was a pointlessness to it  --  the inevitable tedium of nature , of natural processes  --  yet she was fascinated . He had liked to work by the river in the mountains , the Natauga , hardly more than creek-size , cutting through the Petries ' property . The old farm , the old buildings . Decayingp265orchards  --  pear , apple , cherry . Birds , small animals , occasionally deer . She had not felt comfortable there  --  it was a place of childhoodmemories for Andrew  --  a place that excluded her  --  and of course it was rundown now , they had not bothered to keep up the old stone house and the old barns . They had summer places , beautiful summer places , elsewhere in the mountains : on Lake Champlain , Lake Placid , and on the coast of Maine . She had not liked the old farm , had resented him driving out there . Why had he felt the need to drag his things a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to work at that small desk in the cabin , by a window with a coarse , dirt-pocked screen , so that he needed a light burning constantly ... ? When the river was obscured by mists , early in the morning , Yvonne stared down into the park  --  across Jefferson Avenue to the war memorial  --  the lovely grouping of oaks and sycamores and spruces . At that time the park benches and the graveled paths were usually empty . She felt an unaccountable satisfaction , hidinghere on the twenty-sixth floor , in a kind of tower , quite safe . The study was nearly as large as the master bedroom . But it looked cramped because of the things jammed into it . There was the leather couch , and a leather chair , and several cane-backed chairs upon which things were piled ; but the main item of furniture was the old desk , an antique rolltop desk made of mahogany . It had a center drawer and on either side three deep drawers with brass knobs . It had innumerable pigeonholes , all stuffed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor to ceiling , against two of the walls , were older shelves , of walnut . There were innumerable books , magazines , pamphlets , papers . There were encyclopedias , dictionaries in several languages , shelves of law books , law journals , bound volumes of Discourses in winecoloredleather with gold lettering , there were books on economics , history , political theory , philosophy ; biographies of great men ; collected letters ; yearbooks ; technical dictionaries ; the works of Aristotle , Kant , Diderot , Hegel , Nietzsche , Burke , De Toqueville , Beard , Marx , Spinoza , Durkheim , and others . On the walls there was space only for a portrait of David Hume , whom Andrew had much admired , and one of those Hudson River watercolors he had liked so much , and several framed and glass-covered explorers '  |p266ma|ps  of the eighteenth century  --  of the world , of North America , and of New York State and the Hudson Bay area . The Turkish rug was well worn by now , an olive-green-brown shade ; the drapes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ceiling was painted brown and seemed rather uncomfortably low . Between the desk and the wall was a large filing cabinet , which looked out of place ; it was made of aluminum , smart and new and gleaming . On the desk , pushed to one side , was an old Remington typewriter and a large , costly office electric typewriterin its plastic protective covering . Everywhere there were papers  --  some in Manila folders with red or green edges , some in piles , some loose . There were a half-dozen aluminum trays with card indexes and several shoeboxes filled with clippings , notes , articles torn out of magazines , photostated copies of manuscripts , and miscellaneous items like paper clips and rubber bands and stamps . At the time of his death Andrew Petrie had retired temporarilyfrom public life  --  had even given up the editorship of his magazine  --  in order to write a book , which he had been writing , in a sense , all his life . There were at least a thousand pages in the manuscript . Some were neatly typed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter , which he had been working on at the time of his death , lay on the desk where Yvonne had placed it . The United States of America : The Experiment That Failed . These pages , some forty or fifty , were badly wrinkled , a few of them ripped , several splattered with blood and now dried stiff , like parchment . Why did she feel feverish when she is not ill , why was each involuntary breath a stab , a risk , as if she were high in the mountainsand surrounded by snow , killing piercing winter air one must breathe despite the pain of each breath ? Why , she did not inquire aloud , did these creatures come to her and drag her spirit down to their level , why did she tolerate it , why , dressed in green linen so dark as to seem black , did she do no more than murmur assent or denial , her eyes fixed upon her sister-in-law 's distraught face withoutallowing herself even to glance at the husband  --  when it wasp267so often to husbands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ironic dismissing look , What a contemptible idiot you married ! But perhaps she would turn to the husband after all . 1'c rlraps she would give him that look if things became really tolerable . She had no time to visit Doris . She made excuses , she faltered as if deliberately embarrassed at the paucity of her excuses , but there was no time for this sort of thing , no time . So the sister-inlawcame to visit her . It was inevitable , there must be a visit , a meeting of some kind , the dead husband 's older sister must make her messy claim and return to tell the others about the life her deceasedbrother 's widow was living . The husband , Arnold Laubach , came with her . He was genial and self-effacing . Yvonne detested such men . She could not bear it , the social subservience of such Wren , the public display they made of their ineptness . And he would not interrupt his wife though the wife was stumbling onto things that were not meant for Yvonne to hear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stabbing , and yet she could not shut out the voice and she could not refuse to breathe  --  she could not refuse to sit here and listen . The Laubachs visited Yvonne one day from about five in the afternoon to nearly seven-thirty . They sat in the living room of the apartment , on Andrew 's furniture , as if they had been invited and were welcome . They drank the drinks Yvonne prepared for them and did not notice , or did not appear to notice , that she merely sipped at hers and then set it aside and forgot it . She made them two more drinks , and then two more . She was quick to play hostess , rising in the middle of a tedious complicated propositionthe sister-in-law was making  --  would Yvonne like to live with them ? would she like Doris to help her with Andrew 's work ?  --  as if it were no more than a stream of words that might be interruptedat any time . She was feverish , she felt almost dangerously feverish , though she was not really excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a taste of her drink . But she spoke to them , as always , coolly and politely , her dark intelligent gaze fixed upon the sister-in-law 's face as if she were someone to be taken seriously . Doris was sometimes distraught . Then she was obstinately pragmatic . She used , even , one of Andrew 's pet words  --  empirical . She seemed to believe it had something to do with common sense . The empirical thing to do , Arnold and I think , would be ... if thep268family could aid you more . . . if there could be more communicationbetween us and more support . . . for you . . . this first year will be so hard , Yvonne , it 's hard for all of us but of course it will be harder for you . . . for you in your .... We have so much room in our house , do n't we , Arnold ? ... and you would be so much safer .... And there would be a chance for us to become closer , at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what did it mean , safer ? She was safe now , would moving to the Laubachs assure her of even greater safety ? Doris , however , did not respond to the question as it was phrased ; she spoke vaguely of threats and rumors and strange coincidencesand  --  and just the problems of living alone , a woman living alone in a city like Albany . It seemed to her and to the family that Andrew would wish nothing else for Yvonne than that the family come forward to help her  --  to support her  --  to protect her . There had been that outrageous Sunday feature story on her , after all  --  old discredited rumors dragged out again and quotations attributed to unidentified " former intimates " of Andrew 's  --  and cheap sensationalattacks like that might be prevented ifYvonne told Doris the Journal had wanted to interview her and she had refused and that was their revenge onDoris assured her she understood : she understood . The entire family understood . . . . the way in which certain requests are turned down , however . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be so very careful with ... . When Yvonne did not reply , did not even assent , but continued to stare stonily at her , Doris went on to allude to certain problems that were arising because of the immensely complicated nature of Andrew 's estate and his wishes for'he family ... and there is Mr. Petrie to consider , in California , if he should ever be spry enough to take the trip he would want to feel absolutely welcome ... in his surroundings . And there 's the child , Andrew 's poor son Michael , who .... Yvonne felt the stabbing sensation , again and again ; she tried to show nothing of the discomfort she felt , though her forehead was damp and very likely there was a film of perspiration on it that the Laubachs might note . We want only what is good for you , what will help you adjust ... . And the rumors ! Already there were rumors . Of course many rumors had circulated about Andrew from the very first , from thep269first stage of his career in state politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . As they should have been . But now the rumors were also about Yvonne . She knew some of them  --  no doubt ? Cruel and nasty and unjust . And yet made to seem plausible . In certain details . At the Golf Club a friend of one of Arnold 's business partners had overheard .... And the daughter of one of Harvey 's aides , in Washington , had been told quite seriously by her roommate in New York .... And there was speculation about .... And a story had been traced back to one of the girls in the District Attorney 's office that dealt with . . . really quite private matters , details no one could know .. . details it would seem no one could know . Or had it been the Police Commissioner 's office ? ... And , though this was another problem , maybe just the beginning of another problem , Hugh had telephoned from New York just the other night to report a rumor he had heard : an exphotographer'smodel hawking her " memoirs " about town to variousnewspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with A and an alleged love affair . No grounds to it , none at all . The whole thing was preposterous . An attempt at blackmail , extortion , nothing more .... Yvonne need not worry about such things because . .. because the family knew how to handle them if they really became threatening . They asked her to join them for dinner , at the club . Yvonne thanked them but declined . Her voice was quite steady . It was over now : evidently over . A few more vague fluttery words about the family , about " poor Stephen " who might also like to " feel welcome , " and then Doris excused herself and left the room for a few minutes . Yvonne and Laubach remained . He had finished his drink but now raised it again to his mouth . When he set the glass down , he looked guiltily at Yvonne . Neither spoke . She had no clear impression of him . A middle-aged man with quizzical harmless features . He was well dressed , like all the Petries , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and Yvonne should have felt better , she did in fact feel suddenly weak ; as if she were about to faint . Laubach rose from his seat and crossed to her , not very steadily . He asked if there were anything he could do ?  --  anything ? Yvonne tried to smile at him . She failed . Anything ? Anything ? Keep that bitch away from me , she heard herself say.  |p270He  was surprised . Somehow she had not expected his genuine surprise . Yet he touched her shoulder , lightly . He touched it as if to comforther before he turned away . There 's Harvey too  --  he mumbled . Yvonne said nothing . They were waiting for Doris to return . Arnold said quickly that Doris had been under a terrible strain ... was n't really herself . . . had dreams and nightmares ... had the idea , which she could n't get rid of , that it might have been done for personal reasons . . . that it had nothing to do with politics at all or political enemies or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone close to Andrew ... someone he knew and trusted . That 's ridiculous , Yvonne said . Then Doris returned , walking rather heavily . She stopped at one of the paintings and murmured a few words , something about having always loved that painting of the river , having had such a sentimental attachment to ... . But the visit was over . What had been intended to take place had not taken place ; or perhaps it had . At any rate the visit was over . Dear Bereaved One : Read about your sad time &; just wanted to write to ask who the hell you people think you are , your so special are you ?

Mrs. Dana is still going strong , my husband and I drove down with the kids last summer , but Mr. Dana is dead ( did you know that ? ) and she ca n't take in any foster children now so she is sort of lonely and loves people to come visit . She showed me a magazine with your picture in it and asked if it was you , but I just could n't get her hopes up , because she takes things so excitedly nowand has high blood pressure ( she is at least 220 pounds now ! ) and Bob says how those magazines just print shit anyway , and you ca n't believe them .

Why ( 10 you think you are different ? I could give you six examples straight off where ... . Dear Mrs. Petrie , Hi ! We have never met but ... . August . Outside the air-conditioned tower the days shimmer and glow in a cloudless , rainless progression ; the skies are wide , blueeyed , something maddening about them , heightened , remorseless . He is impatient , she can feel him crowding against her , breathingonto her . He peers over her shoulder at the papers spread so helplessly before her  --  why does she do everything so slowly , why is nothing being put in order and why has nothing changed ? Now it is August . Two months have passed . Enormous blocks of time have passed  --  boulder-sized , crushing blocks of time . Not a tall man , but he gave the impression of being tall . Compact , with thick , strong shoulders . Hair thinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feathery , like a baby 's fine hair . She saw that at once , was struck by it at once . How curiously vulnerablehe was . . . looking at her so directly , staring at her , as if to in-t imidate her into not really seeing him . Arrogant manners . Eyes pouchy and sad when no one was admiringhim . Wanted to be loved : so she had jeered at him that very first night . His secret , his secret like everyone else 's ! Desperate to be loved . Pretending to be so confident , so utterly sure of himself ... insulting those who gathered about him meekly , acknowledginghim as a kind of prince . That constant guardedness of his , what was it but terror ? She recognized it . She knew it very well . She had lied in order to meet him . Had pretended to be the daughter of a man Andrew had once helped  --  a political favor of some kind , years back  --  a kind word with an employer , perhaps  --  Yvonne with her bright dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a life , as she stood face to face with Andrew Petrie at a reception in Pittsburgh . He had participated in a panel earlier that evening at the Mellon Institute , discussing the phenomenon in recent years of violent , inexplicable swings in public mood  --  backlash voting , reflexes in opposition to personalities rather than to legitimate issues , occasional outbursts of political hysteria that flared up and did great damage and then disappeared again inexplicably  --  andYvonne had sat in the audience , alone , staring at him , hardly hearing what he said . At first she had rejected his words disdainfully , they could not be taken seriously  --  such rightwingfanaticism !  --  such lies !  --  and then she noticed how the other three members of the panel , two of them historians and one of them a Democratic congressman from Pittsburgh , disdained him but deferred to him , oddly , involuntarily  --  always addressing Mr. Petrie or alluding to him , defensively , irritably , with a certain air of self-conscious bitterness and irony . As if he spoke the truths they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlawed , unspeakabletruths in order that they might please the crowd by refuting him . Occasionally the audience interrupted Andrew  --  occasionallyhe was forced to smile , to acknowledge their right to drown him out with their hisses and boos and sporadic shouts . The audience clearly favored the other speakers , the audience sided with them . But Andrew had really triumphed . Beaming , ironic , deft , theatrical , a born competitor , a springy resilient athletic mannerabout him even while he was seated , he gave the impression ofp274always knowing what would happen , of directing and guiding and forcing not only his opponents but his audience as well  --  forcing them into emotion , into the agony of hatred , the unmistakable quickening of the heart 's beat that preceded and accompanied the desire to kill . He taunted them , goaded them into hatred of him ; he forced them to succumb , never quite involved , himself , always courtly and gracious and even boyish , outrageously innocent . " Your secret is that you want control over people , " Yvonne said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too difficult  --  so you force them into hating you . But it 's the same thing . It 's the same thing . You are n't free of them , you 're trapped by them  --  are n't you ? Dependenton them , always dependent on them ! You delude yourself ! You lie to yourself ! " In the taxi he laughed , seizing her hand . He twisted it slightly  --  not meaning to hurt her  --  and she thought at once of her father twisting her mother 's wrist . It did not please her , it was a thought she had not had for many years . She was repelled , angry . She dislikedhim for having forced her into emotion  --  having inspired her into it performance , an imposture , when she had vowed she would not lie again . 1 1ciife , since the day she had walked out of a foster home in Colorado and hitchhiked east , had been a series of lies , one performance after another . She was in her mid-twenties now , but still very girlish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drained , bewildered afterward . She told Petrie that it was impossible to talk to him , impossible to discuss anything with him ; he was not an intellectual , he could not be approached rationally , sanely , though he gave the impression of being so eminentlylogical , and therefore nothing he said counted  --  it was unprincipled , like a jab in the ribs . But even as she spoke she was overcome with emotion , her voice went faint , she began to pant . She hated him for the excitement she was feeling in his presence , seated beside him . " You do n't know me . You ca n't judge , " he said simply . " The things you said tonight  --  " " I say lots of things , " he said . Yvonne had not much interest in men . As a part-time student at the university she had been involved with a man , she had been " in love " with him as far as she knew , and after a year or so the pointlessnessof their relationship had crushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , jangling nerves , the obliteration of their differences in passion , in physical passion  --  and she had reacted violently against him , against men , against the idea of " love . " It was so dull , really . It was not distasteful , only stupid and boring ; Hid dull . She was capable of feeling a genuine interest in the personality of her lover  --  a Marxist , a self-proclaimed revolutionary  --  butincapable of loving him , of continuing to perform in the role of lover , beloved , a creature whose primary connection with another had to be through the body : that repulsed her . With Petrie that evening she heard herself as a voice , sharp , edgy , impertinent  --  shefelt their connection through the mind , through the antagonism of their minds . And then it did not matter , suddenly , whether she felt affection for him or dislike ; it did not matter , exactly what he said or seemed to say , only that he existed , that he roused her to such an intensity of cerebral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was to recognize in him a certainpattern of behavior  --  the near-ecstatic pitch of his public personality , that bright , impersonal , aggressively happy manner , a god 's sense of omnipotence , almost , that led him to do quirky , unexpected , foolish things ( like leaving that reception with a young woman he did not know , and inviting her to his hotel room , not even certain of her name ) , giving way suddenly and abruptly and horribly to depression , sometimes as many as five or six days of depression , during which time he was nearly inert , an old man suddenly , querulous and fretful . But this Andrew Petrie no one saw , no one knew . He kept to himself then . Like a sick animal he hid himself , ashamed , weary . There was almost a defiance in him , in the way he sank into himself , withdrawing from others , not honoringcommitments or appointments , forcing Yvonne  --  as , she supposed , he had forced his first wife  --  to make excuses for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lecture , a speech , a television interview or panel , a large party at which he was a guest of honor . For two or three hours afterward , then , the euphoria continued  --  perhapseven grew slightly  --  as he allowed people to get him drunk , to make him one of them ; it was the only time Andrew drank very much . Afterward , as soon as he was alone  --  as soon as the crowd withdrew  --  the horrible downward plunge , the pitch into a kind of psychic oblivion . Then he was weary , infinitely weary , so fatigued he could hardly undress himself . Then hisp276charming busy theatrical self was extinct  --  his handsome , squarish face went ashen  --  and he had to keep to himself , resting , sometimeslying in a darkened room with a damp cloth over his eyes untilthe spell passed . That first evening he had been extraordinarily talkative  --  interruptingher , joking with her , teasing her  --  begging her not to leave him , not so soon !  --  though careful not to offend her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even by him . They had had a drink together in the hotel lounge , and another drink in his room . It was not late  --  only midnight  --  but Yvonne had felt exhausted , drained by his attention , the relentlessness of his interest in her and the pace of his conversation . She did not really intend to stay with him ; it did not appeal to her at all , not even the glamor of it , of having seduced him . She did not want him  --  that smiling public man , so pleased to be disliked , so eager to acknowledge his enemies . As a man he was very attractive : his gray eyes , his soft silveryblondhalt , the sweet-cynical curve of his smile . She knew little about fashions , cared very little about them , but she could see that he dressed well , with casual , indifferent good taste . He had had too much to drink , his speech was slurred , more and more he interruptedhimself , began again , forgot what he was going to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not care , she did not trust her own feelings , and she would have left him had he not undergoneso extraordinary a transformation  --  suddenly quiet , his face crumpling , an almost infantile exhaustion and formlessness about him . The glass slipped from his hand , he groped for it and was not able to find it , as if his vision had failed . " Do n't leave me , " he whispered . " Wait .  --  Where are you ? Wait . " " Are you ill ? What 's wrong ? " " Do n't leave me .... " " What 's wrong ? " Yvonne cried . He stared toward her as if blind . He blinked . His mouth went slack , his face seemed to age . " Do n't leave , " he whispered . And so she had not left : she stayed with him not only that night , but for most of the following day as well . After the fatigue , after the near-inert , sick depression , he would gradually return to normal ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During this time he needed from Yvonne an almost absolute attention or awareness ; though she did not have to be with him , in the room with him , she had to be thinking of him , concentrating upon him , always aware of him , the center of her consciousness in him , not elsewhere . If they were in Albany die canceled all her engagements . She stayed in the apartment , read or worked silently , did not use the telephone , knocked on the door of his study only when she felt  --  when she sensed  --  that he needed her with him . He might be asleep , or in a kind of stupor ; he might be lying on the sofa , a book unread on his chest ; he might be at the window , staring down into Jefferson Park , or across to the river , his back to her , slightly hunched in his bathrobe . At times he did not even acknowledge her presence . But he knew , he was grateful . Afterward he would thank her . Afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her for having saved his life . And so , gradually , he would return to normal . His personality regainedits stability  --  his moods leveled out  --  he returned to his desk , to his books , to the telephone ; he was extraordinarily sweet , boyish , playful , even rather loving at such times  --  though loving in a boyish way , making no physical demands upon her . He seemed to want forgiveness , and of course she forgave him . " Do n't you love me ? " he would ask at times , wistfully , doubtfully . " Do n't you ... ? But it does n't matter , does it . It does n't really matter . " " It does n't matter , " Yvonne said . She did not love him . And no matter what he said , no matter how convincing or bullying he was , he did not love her ; she was certain of that . " No , it does n't matter , " he would agree . Most of the time she held him in awe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darting movements of his intellect , by the way he leaped from one idea to another , by the range and depth of his knowledge and his capacity for remembering facts ; she believed him to be a genius , the only really brilliant man she had ever met . At other times she was impatient with him  --  his vanity was so transparent !  --  and he did want to be loved , or hated , or talked about , he wanted it so hungrily , so painfully . When he was depressedor ill  --  for he was not in good health , he suffered from excruciatingheadaches and mysterious , ghostly chest and stomach pains that could not be diagnosed  --  she was moved to an an/guished , almost self-lacerating compassion for him , as she might have been moved by the spectacle of a suffering animal . So this was Andrew Petrie ! Her husband now !  --  She pitied him , was absorbed in him , took care of him . In a sense they were married long before he brought her to Albany , to a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another sense , they were never " married " at all . " And so  --  what conclusions have you drawn about the infamous Petrie family ? Do you regret having become involved with us ? Or has it been a profound experience of some kind ? A fiercely rewardingprofound experience , perhaps ? " He tried to speak casually , playfully . But his voice was shrill , his manner agitated and histrionic , as if he were on the verge of screaming . He stared at her face , at her forehead ; he smiled , staring , licking his thin , dry lips , showing his rather poor , grayish teeth . He would not meet her gaze  --  not yet . He was staring at her forehead , or at her mouth , or at the bridge of her nose . He did not look at her body , either  --  except when she had opened the door to admit him and his gaze dipped helplessly to her feet and swung back up again as he stammered hello . " I do n't know what you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be joking . " " I  --  ! Joking  --  ! Never . " " I do n't know what you mean , " she said . He had already finished his glass of sherry . He had swallowed it down without tasting it , nervously , automatically . His laughter was sudden , surprising , corrosive . It seemed to surprise him as much as Yvonne . " The past two months have been very difficult , but everyone in the family has been helpful , " Yvonne said quickly , hardly knowing what she said . " . . . everyone has been helpful , very helpful . " " Eh , they all hate you ! They always have , " Hugh said , grinning . " They 're jealous of you . You see  --  it is n't just the money , his money  --  though in fact he does n't have much , does he ? I mean , by our standards ?  --  since the old man has n't yet died  --  and Andrewp279was counting on that inheritance , I assume , counting on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's done now ! All done ! And I 'm sorry too , genuinely sorry , I think the electorate alw ; ivsbenefits when there are a number of candidates  --  a spectrum of choices  --  not just the middle-of-the-road boys but the fringe boys as well  --  the radical right and the radical left should definitely be represented  --  kept in plain sight  --  invited up on the platform with the rest . That 's the beauty of our open society !  --  democracy , that sort of thing . Range of choices . . . . But Andrew 's contribution to the show is over , a hideous loss  --  hideous . You must feel it doubly , Yvonne , having been his wife and I assume one of his most feverish  --  fervent  --  admirers ? I wish there were something within my power I could actually , actually do  --  " Yvonne could not believe what she heard : she sat facing him , listening to the dangerous rattling charge and slide of his voice , and could not believe what she heard . He broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staccato succession , and poured another glass of sherry for himself . He was obviously very excited ; she could smell the odor of his armpits , of his unwashed body . At first she thought he must be drunk . Then she thought he might be on drugs  --  that queer lilt to his voice , the glittering of his eyes , the way he kept interrupting himself to clear his throat and laugh . He must have lost several pounds since the funeral , for he looked far thinner , almost emaciated . His cheeks were hollow , the sockets of his eyes darkly shadowed , and his neck appeared to have shrunk inside the collar of his shirt  --  a lavender and pale yellow striped shirt with a button-down collar , years out of fashion . As he spoke he kept in constant motion , as if it were unbearable for him to be here  --  unbearable for him to have to sit still in one place : he crossed and uncrossed his long , lanky legs , showing an inch or more of exposed skin  --  stark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green socks , which seemed to have ridden down into his shoes beneath his heels ; he kept setting his sherry glass down and snatching it back up again , clicking the rim softly against his teeth : he gestured with his left hand , the fingers spread wide , as if appealing to her . Yvonne could not make sense of his words . She tried to concentrate but was distracted by his manner , his tense straining grin , the way he seemed to be appealing to her in some secret , silent way , confidentially , conspiratorially . He was chattering about the investigation  --  the teams of detectives  --  thep280many false arrests , false confessions  --  the overlapping , jealous , rivalrousauthorities  --  the spies everywhere , so that none of the Petries could ever again lead a private life  --  did she imagine she was any different ? And what about the flowers he had sent to the funeral home , $85 or was it $95 worth of flowers , a " grave blanket " was the term , he believed  --  had she taken note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such gestures in the flurry and excitement of those days  --  ? Yvonne was frightened . She could not follow him , he spoke so rapidly . What had Andrew said about him ?  --  harmless  --  The poo$bastard is harmless  --  but perhaps she should not have opened the door to him , she was frightened , sick with a sensation of blank helpless despair , the despair of being in error , of having made a mistake . That she could have been so stupid !  --  she , Yvonne Petrie ! Now she was unable to think clearly , unable to think  --  what must she do ?  --  what was possible ?  --  for she must not offend or upset him , she must not allow him to know how he terrified her . It was sickening , that she had made this mistake : had not quite understood him when he telephoned those several odd times , had refused to interpret the rush of words , the breathy intimatepressure of his voice . And he had sent her a copy of a book of his , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dear Sisterin-LawWith Highest Regards Yrs . Hugh Petrie  --  and she had done no more than glance through it , in a hurry that day , mildly repelled by the squashed distorted figures , the gleeful madness  --  she had had no time to reply , to thank him  --  had put the book on a shelf somewhere , in the sitting room probably , where she rarely went  --  had forgotten about it completely . But perhaps he had forgottenas well ? He was speaking so animatedly , so urgently of his family , as if testing her  --  or as if , in some peculiar way , he wanted to check with her , to see where their realities coincided . " Then you do n't regret it ? Not even now ? Joining our family ? There 's a clause in my grandfather 's will , you know , in default of issue , ' that sort of thing , so if I married and my wife were barren she would not inherit the Petrie money  --  I assume all the cousins have it , I assume Andrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  --  perhaps there are substantial funds elsewhere ? Rewards of an emotional or spiritual nature ? It is said of you , Yvonne , that you are so intellectual !  --  and they do n't approve of that . You should hear Doris rave ! To you , naturally , she shows one face  --   |p281one  side of that pasted-up clownish face  --  and I gather you are friendly with mousy little Hannah ?  --  do n't trust her either , she 's eaten up with jealousy and rage and spite , her father married unwisely , and too late  --  was very shabbily treated by the old man , really vicious even for him  --  poor Hannah , the plainest and poorest of the cousins ! As for Harvey : I hardly need tell you not to trust him . He and Andrew despised each other , as you know . And  --  did you catch it ?  --  an item in the paper , Harvey giving a speech somewhereupstate , the dedication of a new hospital or a new prison or something like that , Harvey Petrie with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AP and sent across America with the rest of the daily garbage  --  Harvey eulogizing his dead cousin !  --  quoting the Bible , quoting Latin !  --  that someone must have trained him to pronounce . Avoid him , avoid that bastard . Just look at his wife  --  Irene 's glazed droopy look  --  she used to be quite beautiful . As did Andrew 's first wife . And you  --  You still  --  They say you are older than your official age , Yvonne , is that so ? Did you lie ? I heard it from a most reliable source  --  someone 's private investigation agency poking around  --  courthouse records , I believe  --  or is that a lie ? No need to look so startled , dear ! I wo n't tell .  --  Then you do n't regret it , marrying him ? Not even now ? Most people who marry into our family , especially women , wake one morning screaming  --  and find themselves unable to stop . . . but you do n't look like the kind of woman who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoic ! Have you ever screamed ? Lost control ? Did you  --  that day ?  --  then ? Did you scream when you saw him ?  - -  My little brother Stephen used to be infatuated with martyrs  --  had a kiddies ' book of the martyrs of North America  --  French Jesuits , I believe  --  I got hold of the book one day and read of the tortures  --  too ugly to describe , I 'm afraid , under the circumstances  --  butthe martyrs did n't scream , refused to scream  --  refused to surrender to their torturers ' wishes  --  what will power , what egomania ! And you , you strike me as  --  But I admire you , of course  --  as everyone does  --  I admire you very much .  --  What was I saying , what was my topic ? Ah yes : the fate of certain women who have married into our family . Most of them were quite wealthy  --  I mean very , very wealthy  --  my grandmother was a Paxton , of Charleston , her father owned most of the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother  --  and then my grandfather  --  my other grand/father  --  ah , it 's so confusing , what am I saying ?  --  and you look so very very stern with me ! I fear I am wearing out my welcome .  --  Old George Petrie , Teddy Roosevelt 's drinking buddy  --  did Andrewtell you about him ?  --  incredible old bastard !  --  even Roosevelt got disgusted with him  --  most of the money channeled into eugenics research ai 1 foundations and " institutes "  --  wanted to keep in with the Ciliegies and the Harrimans but just had n't enough cash , not really : the old booby , so fearful of having his ancestry sullied ! Ilc literally trembled , his spotty old jowls actually quivered if someone happened to mention a name that sounded Jewish  --  let alone Italian or Irish . Thought himself a ladies ' man , too , until the very end , his gums all shrunken away from his denturesand a most amazing , persistent stink emanating from his long woollen underwear . Still  --  though one may mock  --  there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , but eager  --  nay , anxious  --  for the privilege ; he was said to be very , very generous at such times . You might have liked him , I think  --  women did like him  --  at first .  --  Yvonne , may I trouble you for something else besidessherry ? I do n't like sherry . It does n't agree with me . Some sort of English affectation , is n't it ?  --  sherry ?  --  Andrew brought the habit back with him from England , I believe , very impressed by one of the noble lords  --  an " historic " house , that sort of thing  --  invited him and the other wife , what's-her-name , for a month of fox hunting and carousing and talk of politics  --  somewhere in Sussex , was it ? Or do n't you know ? It 's quite possible he did n't tell you about the glories of his past  --  when he was a Senator from the Empire State  --  the good old days of his prime .  --  But have you anything else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd splotches on his cheeks  --  pale , bloodless spots , like frostbite . And the tip of his nose was waxen pale . Yvonne thought : He 's the one . " Do you mind if I get it myself ? I assume the liquor cabinet is here ?  --  over here ? " he got to his feet , rather slowly . Standing , there was a cautious , almost graceful manner about him , as if he were deliberately holdinghimself in restraint , not surrendering to the impulse to jump up . For the first time since Andrew 's death , since she had realized he was dead  --  had known of his death somehow  --  had sensed it , felt it  --  for the first time since that moment , Yvonne knew fear : the nullity of fear , the cold , helpless stupidity of panic . Nothingp283to be done , nothing to be done . She stared at Hugh 's gawky , mockgracefulfigure and could not reply . " How quiet you are , Yvonne ! How subdued this afternoon ! I do n't remember you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet , we two ?  --  that reception for my father ?  --  my father 's retirement ? Ah , you were n't subdued then !  --  you were wonderfully , wonderfullyalive  --  rather outrageously alive  --  as everyone noted at the time . You are taking your widowhood quite seriously  --  ? And is it an interesting experience ? A rewarding experience ? " " I  --  I 'm  --  I do n't understand you , " Yvonne said faintly . " I 'm not to be understood , " he called over to her . " I 'm only to be experienced . " She heard herself talking . She heard her unfamiliar childhood voice , a girl 's brave hollow voice , she heard it from a distance , hoping it would not falter , would not break , revealing her utter terror . The child at the Emergency Welfare Center in White Springs  --  taken from her mother and her mother 's lover very early one Sunday moning  --  taken away in a State Trooper 's squad car  --  wrapped in someone 's jacket  --  nose bleeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had n't hurt her , no one had hurt her , where were they taking her ?  --  and the same voice in the dining hall , in the recreation room , in the interviewing room  --  Yvonne always the tallest of the girls in her age group , always the most articulate , the most intelligent  --  Yvonne Radek always the most cunning  --  pretending at times to be shy , to be meek  --  but always alert , intense , with that glacial , uncanny calm : no one could intimidateher . Not her . In the first of the foster homes , and in Juvenile Detention  --  as a runaway  --  as an " incorrigible "  --  and in the last foster home  --  Yvonne always the most observant , the most clever , alert to the point of insolence . She talked , she knew how to talk , from the very first she had imitated one of the young brash matrons  --  the most popular one , the one whose cruelty was forgivenher : for was n't she fearless , confident , without remorse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quick empty smile , the rather ticlike grin . It had not failed her , that performance . It had never failed her so far . " Ah , what a remarkable woman you are ! " Hugh sighed . He wiped his face with a tissue ; he took off his glasses and dabbed at his eyes . Strange , he was almost attractive  --  almost , except for hisp284mottled cheeks , a handsome man . His light brown hair was frizzy , damp-looking , like a boy 's hair ; without his glasses he looked boyish . Then he put them back on and looked at her . She shivered . " Extraordinary , " be said , " how brave you are  --  active  --  carrying on without him  --  that sort of thing . Everyone assumed you would simply take the money and run  --  if there is much of an estate  --  is there ? Or has n't it been cleared yet ? I suppose not ; these things take ages ; and there are evidently libel suits still pending against him ?  --  poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at peace . He must be enjoying himself ! I like to think so !  --  And so you are carrying on as usual  --  I think it 's to your credit  --  will hush the rumormongers  --  what a very good idea , a scholarship fund in his honor  --  he was such a fine scholar , you know , in prep school and as an undergraduate  --  mainly A 's  --  a really outstanding record  --  made poor Stephen and me look awfully silly , needless to say . And you 're going to edit his manuscripts ? What a contribution to American letters ! I wish I could help but I 'm no good with words  --  arranging words on paper  --  my talent is for the visual , for the eye  --  sensual rather than cerebral , that 's me  --  sensual to my fingertips  --  notvery cerebral , never very intellectual , I 'm afraid  --  unlike him . Yes , my dear , you 've done beautifully so far . I want to congratulate you . And was there a cover story on you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Doris mentioned it  --  said it was awfully cruel of them to do it against your wishes  --  without your cooperation  --  but that 's your fate , Yvonne , as his widow . Eh , I 'm sorry ! Will this leave a ring ? It 's been so long since  --  used to be so conscious of  --  my mother had such exquisite furniture , you know , we had to be careful where we set things and I felt safe only in my room  --  or in the bathroom , where I could hide for hours  --  that sort of thing . Maybe you can buff it up ? Is that the correct term ? No doubt you have a maid  --  certainly you have a maid  --  she can buff it up . And now  --  You look awfully tired , Yvonne , am I exhausting you ? I sometimes have that effect on people  --  and I swear I do n't know why . " Yvonne laughed suddenly . Hugh glanced at her  --  his eyeglasses sliding down his nose , his lips pricking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? You think I 'm amusing ? "  |p285She  drew in her breath sharply . No : she must not laugh . She was in danger . There was danger here  --  danger surrounding her  --  she had made a mistake , allowing this stranger into the apartment  --  had blundered , had acted stupidly  --  all along thinking the assassinwas not an individual , not a fleshly creature , but an abstraction  --  an idea  --  a theory : not a man at all . She had not understood , she had n't believed , had n't known . Theory : abstraction . Not men . Not a man . Running out to the highway through the woods  --  escaping to a car on the highway  --  phantasmal laughing gliding shapes  --  had n't she known they must be real , human like herself ?  --  like this man ? But of course this man was not the assassin . That was impossible . She had misjudged him , had been frightened for no reason , panicked to the point of nausea . No reason , no reason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bobbing , a patch of pale skin exposed  --  how innocent , her brother-in-law Hugh Petrie ! She held her breath , watching him . No , she must not laugh . He wanted her to laugh  --  he was waiting , deliciously , waiting for her to surrender , submit , break into helpless laughter . His eyebrows were arched , a jester 's eyebrows . He was innocent ; innocent . The odor of his excited , lustful body reached her , but she would not laugh . " Your husband hardly soggy in the grave , and already you are merry ?  --  giggling ?  --  flirting with a blood relative ? " Yvonne suddenly snorted with laughter . She could not help herself . " What 's wrong ? " she cried . There was a man staring toward her , as if he were blind . His fair brown hair disheveled  --  his lips moving silently . Something had slipped from his fingers , had fallen to the floor . The sound was muffled ; the floor was carpeted . That floor was carpeted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you want from me ? " She went out during the day . She began to accept invitations . She went to libraries ; arranged for a carrell in the State Historicalp286Museum . Daylight made her drowsy , dark made her awake , alert , tense , cautious . But triumphed . She lay awake and thought : Insomnia . Others have suffered insomnia . During the day her drowsiness was a kind of comfort . And there were so many people now  --  when she left the apartment , when she went into the city  --  emerging from the elevator into the foyer , even  --  there were so many people , so much to take into account , she rarely had any need to think of herself , to console herself . She thought : Sorrow . Others have suffered sorrow . Emerging from the library , standing for a moment at the top of the steps . Here is the widow , here is his widow . She experiences the pleasant sensation of being involved  --  in all these people  --  the public square , the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out  --  involved , absorbed in , obliterated in . It is an infinitely wide , infinitely fine web of nerves cast out everywhere , throughout the city and beyond , men and women caught up in work , in separate but ultimately connected activities : office workers , men and women , well dressed , some with briefcases , girls with shoulder bags and fashionable shoes  --  men with airline bagsvalises  --  splendidlywell groomed , most of them  --  people like herselfand Andrew . Civilized , they are . Alive . Cheerful in the sunlightof early autumn  --  why should they not be cheerful today ?  --  why should they not give the appearance of being cheerful ?  --  secretaries , legislators , lawyers , tourists  --  the living and the dead both  --  hurrying across the square , along the paths , along the sidewalks  --  inchingout into the street , eager for the traffic lights to change . She is exhilarated by the sight of them , of the commotion , the stream of life . She is reassured , the external world continues , it has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enormous Schumacher Building and the fountain with the sprightly cast-iron sculpture at its center she is approached : someone speaks to her shyly . Spray from the fountain touches them . Neither can move , it is one of those clumsy social moments ; she would  --  if she were less aware of his uneasiness  --  move back , away from the spray . What a shock to see her ! He had been thinking of  --  at that very moment thinking of  --  of  --  Of Andrew ? Of Andrew . Had been thinking of the magazine , the next issue  --  the first since  --  the first  --  The first issue with his name on the masthead as editor-in-chief . " Acting Editor , " he had been . Thep287past year and a half . He had been thinking of that and of Andrew and of her : yes , he had been thinking of her . " Could I see you sometime ? For lunch ? For lunch , here , around here , where it 's convenient for you ?  --  so that we could talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small notebook she keeps in her purse . She enters his name , Eliot Stacey . Not long afterward Harvey himself dropped by . Shook her hand , held it hard . Warm dry hand , reassuring . Harvey himself splendidly blue-eyed , in a light wool suit , tweed , something sporty about the lapels and the buttons  --  the sort of thing Andrew might have chosen for himself . Asked her about the papers ?  --  letters ?  --  work on the " book " ? Was she feeling better ? Was she going to see people again ? Not too many people , of course ; and not the wrong people . " Who are the wrong people , " Yvonne asked ironically . I larvey enumerated them . Yvonne interrupted : "  --  That one is harmless , is n't he ? " " Everyone is harmless in theory , " Harvey said . " I do n't see why I should listen to you , " Yvonne said . " I do n't sec why I should take your instructions seriously . " " You would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He rubbed his hands together and smiled . " It 's part of your ... it 's part of your condition , let 's say , not to see ; not to want to accept instructions . Andrew was like that too . He was like that even as a boy . If he had taken advice from certain members of his family , who wished him only well , who were not jealous of him and working against him . . . if he had taken their advice .... " Yvonne looked away . He was silent , as if waiting for her to look back . He faced her across the massive smoked-glass coffee table , big dry hands clasped together , patient , sympathetic , sly . " If he had taken that advice . . . " Harvey said gently. " ... he would have been a mediocrity , " Yvonne said , still not looking at him , smiling . She spoke rather softly but he did not ask her to repeat what she had said . " He would have been indistinguishablefrom the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvey said . When Yvonne did not reply he went on , in a forced , conversationaltone : " Have they called you in to ask questions about  --  ?  |p288The  latest development  --  ? Maniac stopped at the Canadian borderwith gun , and ammunition  --  an old acquaintance of our Stephen 's , they say  --  name of Raschke ? " " They call me in often , " Yvonne said . " They do n't call me in often , " Harvey said . " They must think I 'm innocent ... must think I 'm completely out of it . I resent that , in a way . ... But you , Yvonne , you do n't seem to think I 'm innocent ? " " I do n't know what you 're talking about , " Yvonne said sharply . " You do n't seem to trust me , do n't care to confide in me .... Is there anyone else ? There 's no one else . I 'm reasonably sure there 's no one else . At the present time . " Her knifelike smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something apart from her . " ... do n't have the right to talk to me like that ... taunting me , bantering with me ... " she said in a low , hoarse voice . " You do n't ... you have n't . . . there is nothing between us , no claim between us . You 're stupid and vulgar and transparent , a transparent opportunist , those are Andrew 's words and not mine . He would be disgusted to see you here , in his home , smiling that unctuous intolerable smile of yours . . . only fools could be taken in ... seduced .... We know about your politicaldeals and your women , your girls , your secretaries and stenographersand college girl Young Republicans and volunteer campaignworkers .... " Harvey laughed . He seemed genuinely amused . She could not look at him , however ; she did not want to meet that fixed , mockingstare of his . " We know about lots of things , " Harvey said zestfully . " We are omnipotent . Are n't we miraculous , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " ... You have no right to come here , to persecute me , " Yvonne said . " I know you hated Andrew and Andrew made no secret of his feelings toward you . I know you despise me . I do n't want you not to despise me . It does n't matter that you 're so powerful and influential and that the Petries are all clustering around you ; they wo n't listen to you if you go against Andrew and me , they 've changed their ... some of them have changed their minds about me .. . they have told me personally ... have expressed their feelingspersonally to me , after his ... after the .... They accept me , most of them . They accept me as much as they can , under the cir/cumstances , and I do n't expect ... I do n't want ... I 'm not going to campaign for myself ...

" " Circumstances make their own laws , " Harvey said . His exuberanttone of only a moment before had vanished , or had been retracted . He spoke bluntly , with no desire to charm . " Persons ... personalities ... your elegant icy hysteria and my erratic compulsions. . . your being so fatally close to him , a twin of his . . . and my childhood fascination with . . . with him : these things do n't matter . It 's the circumstances that must be taken seriously , not the performers . Not the persons . Who are you , after all ? Yvonne Radek ... ? Who is Yvonne Radek ? " Ile got to his feet . He spoke ponderously , without feeling . She looked at him now , slitting her eves , fearful of him , but she saw that he was neutral , colorless ; his gaze seemed flattened . " We 'll be friends . I 'm sure of that , Yvonne . Friends . Friendly . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... any more than I took seriously Andrew 's pretensions. .1 am only stupid and vulgar and transparent when it suits my purpose . After all  --  I am not merely a politician , I 'm an intelligent civilized man , and my family is older than the nation itself  --  I 'm as good as your late husband in every way , Yvonne , and maybe better in some ways . But we have time , we have a future . Certain details can wait . ... The one thing you must know , however , is that I am innocent ... I mean that in every way  --  literally , metaphorically  --  directly or indirectly  --  you must know that , you should know that unless you 've become unbalanced , seriously unbalanced . Really , it 's beyond all sane speculation .... " " Yes , " Yvonne said . " I was n't Andrew 's enemy . I was his cousin . We supported each other in public most of the time . I was n't his enemy , I was his friend . And I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A living man . A man who is alive , eh ?  --  You 'll see . " " Yes , " Yvonne said . " People are free to think that . " As the months passed she received a number of gifts from Hugh Petrie . They included a dozen long-stemmed red roses , a white silk scarf from Bergdorf Goodman 's with the price tag still attachedp290($65) , another copy of Eminent Contemporaries , missing the dust jacket , with a simple " Love , yr. brother-in-law H. " inscribed ; a hammered gold falcon , ten inches high , from Cartier ; three poinsettiasin a large earthenware pot ; a number of costly art books mailed directly from Manhattan bookstores  --  the photographs of Ansel Adams , the political satires of Goya , a history of the animatedcartoon in the United States , with most emphasis on Walt Disney , The Erotic Art of India , Scotland Yard 's Most Sensational Cases : With ioi Unsparing Photographs ; a yellowed lace mantilla or shawl that , a note explained , Hugh 's **32;1820;TOOLONG worn to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an artist of whom Yvonne had heard , but about whom she knew nothing  --  it portrayed a hideous creature with a crow 's head and the body of a man , and Yvonne did no more than glance at it before she closed the carton in which it had come , thinking she would give it away  --  donate it to one of the local museums , perhaps . And he sent her a carelessly wrapped fakefurpillow in the shape of a human tongue , feverishly pink ; it arrivedsoiled and partly shredded . And a very simple pen-and-ink drawing of a man and a woman making love , locked in an anguished , complicated embrace , the woman streaming long black hair and the man rather like Hugh , with glasses slipping comically down his nose . . . it was not at all obscene and Yvonne studied it placidly before ripping it up . He sent her , also , a pen-and-ink map of Natauga County . It showed the north and south forks of the river , the lakes , the town of Fremont , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spot , on the river , where Andrew had died . Outside the county were indicated the Adirondack Mountains , the foothills , Mt . Invemere , Royal Mountain , the Sacandaga Reservoir , the Mohawk and Hudson Rivers , and the cities of Gloversville , Schenectady , and Albany . The Hudson River was noted in an abbreviated , stylized way ; as were New York City and Long Island . At the very tip of Long Island there was another X. Yvonne studied the map , could read nothing in it . It seemed to be a fairly accurate map . The land owned by the Petries in that county was considerable  --  but of course most of it was wild , acres and acres of woods . She studied the map , she was not angry , not bewildered . She had an impulse to make another X on it  --  the X that would mark her own position at the time of the assassina/Lion  --  but she resisted . She threw the map out , she forgot about it and about Hugh . Twenty-eight years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke the truth . She herself did not know always . And it was inconsequential . Sometimes she lied , sometimes she told the truth . Andrew had always cautioned her : Tell no more than you are required to tell . But she had not needed him for that wisdom . She had always known . Do you recognize this person ? What do you know about this person ? What was your relationship with this person ? What was your husband 's relationship with this person ? Are you still in contact with  --  ? Have you any reason to suspect or have grounds for  --  ? Did your husband ever indicate  --  ? Ever mention  --  ? Thirty years old . Sixteen years old . A runaway . Had walked away , actually  --  in full view of them all  --  shamefaced , defiant . Who was going to stop her ! Who would dare touch her ! Nagged and slapped and , on the cellar steps , in the cold wet stink of the cellar with its dirt floor , mauled , punched , humiliated . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't mean any harm , he 's fond of you , you more than the others . She was fifteen years old . Seventeen . On the road , dressed like a boy , the checked flannel shirt loose over the sleeveless black sweater , she was eighteen years old and hitchhiking usually to a town not many miles to the east ; to an army officers ' base where her father  --  separated from the family  --  was stationed . The long rides she declined , unless a woman was in the car . She was never going far , never risking much distance . Eighteen years old , she claimed , if anyone asked . Often they did ask . She was hitchhiking to visit her father , who expected her . She was saving bus fare . She had done it several times in the past . In White Springs her mother had often shown her a certain snapshot : a stern but attractive girl , her hair prim and neat in a page-boy , standing before a DeSoto , arms folded , posture confident , fearless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older cousin , not seen for many years but rumored to be " well-to-do . " In Pittsburgh , the girl was a thick-waisted woman in her forties , morep292vexed than surprised when she opened the door to Yvonne . What had happened ? What was the meaning of this ? She claimed not to have heard of the name Radek , claimed never to have known who her cousin had married or where she had ended up  --  Colorado or California or Alaska . Yvonne in the soiled jeans , the flannel shirt , the black sweater reeking of stale perspiration , eyes pink , nose running . " You 're no real relation of mine , " the woman said . " There 's no blood connection . Anyway I do n't believe in that sort of thing nowadays . . . . I just do n't believe in it . " Nevertheless Yvonne was allowed to stay . She kept house , worked , went to high school at night . Her mother 's cousin insisted that the name Radek was a total mystery to her , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had happened  --  about any of it . Her own life was burdensome enough . Her own life was puzzling enough . Did Yvonne understand ? Yvonne understood . " Do you love me ? " One of the widow 's lovers asked her this question . She was teased , tormented . She wanted to tell the truth  --  wanted to discover the truth and then utter it , publish it , as the world required . She was nervous . Ferret-faced , ferret-clawed . Nineteen years old . And then twenty . Twenty-one . Sometimes nineteen again , sometimes twentytwo . She lost the drift of what was happening  --  could not believe that anyone would hold her responsible . After all , everyone was dead back home . Certainly no one remained living . She avoided the word orphan , which embarrassed . She was five feet nine inches tall , long waisted , with rather long feet and hands , a glacial chill to her brown eyes , bluish-black hair she wore parted in the center of her head ; certainly the word orphan was inappropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salesgirl . Student was neutral . Student was fine . Abortion , at that time , was a word rarely uttered . It was never , never to be found on public billboards or in public advertisements . It was not often thought , even in the privacy of one 's most secret life . Must she arrange for one ?  --  must a friend arrange for one ? Her lover , who worked at a Ford assembling plant , the graveyard shift , and at a bowling alley on the weekends , who was editing a smudged , rather crude and embarrassingpulp magazine  --  Worker &; Poet  --  remained innocent , not knowing . This allowed her to forget him soon after . She forgotp293a great deal , so there was little difficulty in forgetting him . And it turned out there had been no need for an abortion . So she forgot about that too . " Do you love me ? " they asked . She could not take them seriously , could not concentrate . Unless concentration is possible , love can not exist ; can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blew it out . She yawned and blew it out . She was nineteenyears old . She wore skirts and sweaters and boots , and a navy blue coat with a collar that could be turned up to protect her face from the wind . She narrowed her eyes : her eyelashes went white with snowflakes , frost , suspicion . She could not take them seriously  --  did not care to be pawed , teased , caressed , mauled , loved  --  loved , as people called it ; loved . Fifteen years old or nineteen or twentysix , she was not deceived . Love was the word they assigned to their need , their ephemeral , egoistic need ; she was the accidental object of that need and might easily be replaced by another object . There was no connection , no necessary connection . She did not believe in that sort of thing . Lover too was a word that embarrassed , that was inappropriate . But she could not think of another word . Husband ? One must concentrate . Hands and mouth and body : there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the racing of the intellect stilled , excluded . There was a lover , the lover had a name , a personality , a history . One must concentrate , one must suspend judgment , one must not be critical and sharp edged and impatient . One must have faith . Afterward , she forgot him . She had not been pregnant  --  had never been pregnant . Did not intend to be pregnant . " I do n't regret the one child I do have , " Andrew told her . " A son . A rather precocious boy , though terribly spoiled by his mother  --  ruined by her and her relatives , in fact . I do n't regret Michael , I love him very much . But as for more children  --  " After a moment Yvonne said she understood . " In my generation there are thirty cousins , " Andrew said . " Approximately . I do n't think the world really requires more of us . " " And then the estates are divided in so many ways , " Yvonne said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which must be very disappointing . "  |p294Andrew  glanced at her , as if in surprise . " Yes , " he said . " Yes , precisely . Disappointing . " Not lover but husband . He was like her mother 's cousin in some ways : liking or dislikingsuch people was inappropriate , a confused reaction . It did not matter that one liked , it did not matter that one disliked . The personality was supreme , untouched , indifferent . When Yvonne moved out of the cousin 's house , having rented a room not far from the university , the woman , hearing her on the stairs with the two suitcases and the grocery bag of books , preferred to remain in the kitchen with the door closed , heating a teakettle , humming loudly to herself . " Good-by ! " Yvonne called . " I 'm leaving now  --  good-by ! " She must have been nineteen then . She worked part-time in the university library , and on Saturdays at one of the bookstores in the area . She had a lover then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but she was not moving out to live with him . " Thank you ! Thank you for everything ! " Yvonne shouted from the front door . The house was silent , the woman 's humming subsided . Yvonne did not dare rush into the kitchen . She did not dare start to weep . What point was there in that , what difference would it make ? " Thank you for everything ! " she shouted from the front door . The woman was a sales clerk in the Ladies ' Lingerie &; Sleepwear department of Stern 's , a large downtown store . Once Yvonne went there not to buy anything but simply to confront her  --  to face her . Radek ? Had there been no Radek ? She would see about that . At first she could not locate the woman . Then she saw her  --  behind the corset counter . Yvonne approached slowly , hesitantly . She would see about that ! She would  --  But the change in the woman was enormous . Yvonne had not seen her for several years and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders rounded , tired . She wore bifocal glasses . Her hair was a perky synthetic silver , pressed down upon her head like a helmet . She did not seem to notice Yvonne approaching . Hello ! I only wanted to sayI must tell you about my good fortune  --   |p295I  thought you 'd be pleased toBut no : she could not . She hesitated , stopped . What was she doing , what did she want ? What connection was there between her and that woman with the wrinkled , peevish face ?  --  now speakingirritably to a younger woman , another sales clerk ? I want my own mother , Yvonne thought . Later she thought : Not really . Much later , years later , she thought : Not really . No . None of them . Not even him . She was going to survive his death . Always he brushed near her . His demands were not a lover 's demands  --  he was not jealous  --  but he was acutely aware , always near , listening . He was not jealous . She believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile of his , as if taken by surprise . " So you live here . You live here , " he said . He spoke as if amused , trying to disguise his nervousness. " . . . so high . " Yvonne said nothing . She stood watching him , studying him . IIe avoided her serene , level gaze , went to the balcony , said something about the view  --  a spire in the distance was his church  --  that is , a Catholic church in his neighborhood  --  miles away . He went into the sitting room . He saw the piles of letters  --  the unopened envelopes  --  the cards in stacks . " Jesus ! You do n't have to answer all this , do you ?  --  GOD BE WITH YOU IN YOUR HOUR OF DEEPEST NEED . SOMEDAY THE CLOUDS WILL PART . HEARTFELT SYMPATHY FROM OUR HEARTH TO YOURS . " He picked up a magazine . Yvonne judged from its pale yellow cover that it was the September issue of Discourses . He leafed through it , said nothing , put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? " he said . Yvonne did not reply . She remained standing in the doorway . " The only thing I ever read of his , " Wunsch said with an odd defiant twist of a smile , " was an exquisitely mad essay in anp296anthology , a collection of essays on the Rosenberg case . I was an undergraduate at the time . I did n't quite understand your husband'sposition . Whether they were guilty or not was n't an issue ?  --  guilty in the sense of having done anything , or having conspired to ?  --  but guilty in terms of the evidence presented in the courtroom , during the trial , in the physical confines of the courtroom  --  was n't that it ? Something like that ? " " You 're oversimplifying his argument , " Yvonne said . " But basically you 're correct . " ... and then his style , his style was unreadable .... His was the only essay in the book that had a voice , a tone , it was really perverse , and in a perverse way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as he was talking like this , moving about the room , he had conquered his excitement ; he glanced toward her and then away . " However , I never read anything of his again . I want to be utterly frank with you . " " But why ? " Yvonne said . The nervousness was his ; he seemed to have relieved her of it . " Why should you be utterly frank ? " " I would n't want us to misunderstand each other  --  " " But why should it matter to you whether we misunderstand each other ? " Yvonne said , puzzled . " Do you think  --  " " I only meant  --  " "  --  it matters ? " " In Pittsburgh I was a volunteer worker for a man who was running for Congress , a very fine man , a black man named Dwyer . He was a Democrat . He was an attorney but not an extremist of any kind . He was very intelligent , patient , a little slow ... slow in his speech . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to work through the structures that existed rather than tearing them down ; but the other blacks , the extremists , got most of the publicity . . . . Andrew came to Pittsburgh , he introduced Dwyer at one of Dwyer 's rallies and gave a history of black politics , showed how certain developments were part of a necessary pattern and how other developments were not ; how the moderate and the conservative survived while the extremist passed away , how the only hope for minority people was to work through the existing structures of government . He was really an optimist : he had faith in the future . But he connected it with the past , he said we must read the future out of the past . The freedom the blacks wanted atp297that time  --  the extremists  --  was like the freedom they were given after the Civil War  --  the euphoria of freedom , simple self-determination , the brutality of such freedom  --  the meaninglessness of it  --  without education , training  --  discipline  --  " " But you 're serious ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I misinterpreting you ? " " You asked how we had met , " Yvonne said . Her voice was rapid , light , effortless . She might have been reciting a prepared speech , the words came so easily . But she had never said them before ; she had never told this particular story to anyone . Most of the facts were authentic  --  there had been a Dwyer , in Scranton  --  but she had already been Andrew Petrie 's companion at the time . " Yes , " he said . " But it 's much more serious than I had thought . " " Everything is serious , " Yvonne said . " Why are you so upset ? " They had met by accident , on the street . At first she had not recognized him  --  he looked so anonymous , nameless  --  insignificant . But there was something about his small boyish head , his curly brown hair , his rather impudent manner , that attracted her . He had had several drinks . He was not so energetic now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said softly . Yvonne laughed . " In what way could we misunderstand each other ? " she said . He looked at her , miserable . He got to his feet , approached her , his fingers twitching . " If you  --  Would you  --  " " Yes ? " She had had her hair cut a few days earlier . Bangs scissored across her forehead , neat , severe , level with her eyebrows . A few gray hairs , they told her . But nothing to worry about : just pull them out as they appear , one by one . Until , of course , there are too many to pull out . She had had her hair cut , but her old attitude , her old manner of intense , expectant cynicism was gone . In the past , in her girlhoodand young womanhood , she had experienced a certain keen , gloating delight , a detached and even rather sinister delight , in her appearance : a jaunty cynicism of a kind . Her appearance had nothing to do with her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The long , thick hair , which could be brushed until it gleamed  --  the good , strong cheekbones  --  the eyes , the mouth  --  the strikingly pale skin : all , all were superficial . They did not represent her , in a way they masked her , allowed her to hide quite comfortably inside , somewhere deep inside , cunning and patient . She heard her voice performing when it cared to perform . She witnessed her own behavior from a distance , from a distance inside her , really oblivious to other people . There was a world of strangers , irrelevant and apart from her , not related at all . Of course he crossed over , he had touched her . But no one else . And even he had been deceived in a way ; had been attracted by what was least significant about her , her appearance . That others should look at her and see only the appearance of her , the superficial husk of her , had been bewildering at first and then , as the years passed , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished . She could seem to be what she appeared to be ; it was a sanctuary of a kind . That other people might be hiding , cleverly hiding , wearing their own faces like masks , would occur to her from time to time  --  but only when she was in the presence of someone who , like herself , was extraordinarily sharp witted , alert , suspicious . Most people dreamed , staggered through life in a dream , not knowing that they staggered , drifted , fell slowly forwardand downward , imagining they controlled their destinies ; there were so few of the others , the keenly awakened ones , so few Yvonne had met , and even with these uncommon people  --  even with Andrew  --  she could usually retreat , observe , perform as she thought it best to perform , all the while intensely awake , passing judgment . She was in control then , always in control . It was not that she wanted to manipulate people  --  though sometimes , of course , it was necessary that she manipulate them  --  nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracted to her ; certainly she did not want them to fall in love with her . That storm of misunderstandings , misinterpretations  --  that hallucinatory chaos  --  did not appeal to her at all . It was dangerous , ungovernable . She did not want to be loved  --  did not want what people called love  --  at all . But she did want to control their idea of her , their interpretation of her , the image they carried away in their imaginations . It gave her pleasure of a kind , a strong cerebral pleasure . It confirmed her cynicism , her detachment , her own pure and undefiled identity . Imposture forced upon her  --  as in the old days , in the foster homesp299and in the juvenile detention home , and even in Pittsburgh for a while  --  was repulsive , horrible ; she felt a violent hatred for those who forced her to deceive them , to court them or elude them or deceive them outright . That was hideous , certainly . But imposture for its own sake , freely chosen : she delighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , purely playful , yet there was something sacred about it , an almost mystical seriousness about it , and she could be very much moved by herself at such times . Her appearance in a full-length mirror , that uncanny specter of herself as a beautiful woman . . . how marvelous it seemed to her , how she gloated in it ! For it was the perfect disguise , the perfection of a disguise , drawing strangers ' eyes to it while simultaneously blinding them , dazzling them , distracting them . And should she one day no longer appear to be beautiful , should she feel that kind of power fading , why would she care ? There were other kinds of power . But now her old , innocent delight was lost to her , now she stared indifferently at what was presented  --  the black hair cut so severely across the forehead , enlarging the eyes , making the neck seem longer . They said to her , flattering her , How this becomes you , Mrs. Petrie ! How lovely ! She was unmoved , indifferent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at seeing her  --  approving of the change  --  complimenting her as he often did , easily and courteously , in that social manner she had noticed in a number of the Petries  --  honey-smooth and yet cool , effortless  --  that small pleasure would be denied her ; he was absent , gone , dead . The thick-lashed brown eyes , lighter than her own . Hazel with flecks of green . The curly hair , not cut in a very flattering style ; or perhaps it had grown out unevenly . Filling with moisture , his eyes . Tears of dismay or anger ?  --  chagrin ?  --  rage ? " . . . sorry , " he murmured . She said nothing . Her mind had been detached for some time : she was thinking of the fact that the apartment should be repainted , except for Andrew 's study ; he had wanted it repainted , had been talking about it for some time , and now she would make the arrangements . Except for his study : not that room . She would not change that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweaty , slick with sweat , and yet cold  --  shivering . She was not well , perhaps . She could not re/member what it was  --  to be healthy , to be able to sleep , to feel well  --  what did that mean , well ?  --  how had she lost it ?  --  though possibly she had lost nothing at all , was remembering the past incorrectly . She detested illness , her own or anyone else 's . She would not think of it , being ill , going to a doctor . And she did not believe she was ill ; her symptoms were mild , some days there were none at all , only a sense of malaise , as if she were coming down with the flu . Sometimes she was feverish , sometimes she was unaccountably cold . But Wunsch too was shivering . He too was coated with sweat , and shivering , miserable . He prepared to leave . Yvonne did not follow him to the door . She said in a quick , concerned voice , as if she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  do n't be disgusted with yourself . You do n't like me , that 's all . " He said nothing . She watched him from the doorway , halfpityinghim. " . . . you do n't like me , perhaps you do n't like women . It does n't matter . " " All right , " he said . " Good-by . " Afterward she dressed and went into the other room to see if he had taken anything . But of course not , he would not have taken anything , he was not that type . She went into Andrew 's study . It was dark ; she switched on the desk lamp . The couch was empty  --  no one lay on it . The room was empty . It was filled with things , yet empty . The drapes looked heavy , oppressive . She did not bother to draw them . So high in the air , so high above the park , no one could see . Andrew  --  ? But he was gone , it was absurd to think of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be apprehended , and he would triumph over them  --  she too would triumph  --  but they must have patience , he must be willing to wait as she waited . Already she had forgotten Wunsch , she had not even spoken his name  --  Larry , was it ?  --  Larry  --  already he had receded , disappeared . Not the assassin , not him . Not that one . He was an enemy , but not the killer . She was certain of that , she knew he would be incapable of murder  --  was incapable , even , of ordinary passion . She sat at the desk . She lifted papers , read them , recognized thep301words  --  which she had read many times  --  and in the same instant lost awareness of them , put the papers back down . The manuscript  --  so many sheets of paper !  --  but she would put it together , she would edit it , would fulfill her obligation to him . After all she was his wife ; it would not have been said , ordinarily , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground and on evergreen boughs , weighing the boughs down , flecked with dirt , melting slowly . There were bunches of bright red berries drooping from skeletal bushes . Birds flew overhead . Andrew pointed out a small flock of Canada geese . They walked together , he leaned a little against her , explaining something . He talked quietly and at great length , never pausing , not giving her time to interrupt or make any comment or ask any question , as if knowing her remarks would be inconsequential . He had been betrayed by his political associates . He had been betrayed by his friends . Someone had assured him that someone else had assured him that a certain very guilty party  --  in this instancethe warden of the Glasberg State Penitentiary  --  had been innocent of the charges made against him , the hysterical accusationsin the left-wing press and elsewhere . Was it the first time , Yvonne wanted to know . Was it the first time anyone had betrayedhim ? She knew it was not , but he was behaving as if it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the deaths of a number of prisoners and the deaths of a number of prison guards and the statistics released by the prison authorities and the evidence of Andrew 's own senses  --  had n't he , along with the other members of the citizens ' investigating committee , spent the better part of a day being led through that disgusting place ?  --  being assured , being assured  --  flattered that one of the prison authority 's attorneys could quote verbatim Andrew Petrie in the Harvard Law Review of several years past  --  and then suddenly to open the paper and read in the headlinesHe spoke with a quiet , astonished outrage , as if it were the firstp302time he had been outraged , either by his friends or his many enemies ; he spoke at great length , at great length , leaning a little against Yvonne , favoring his right leg as he sometimes did in damp weather . When he was especially tired he walked with a considerablelimp . As a child he had climbed on the roof of his parents ' house and had slipped off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg quite badly  --  brutally  --  the thigh bone snapped and the kneecap very nearly crushed  --  served him right , really , for having been so foolhardy , showing off as he had so often in childhood . Fortunately his younger brother , who had followed him , had not fallen with him ; the fall might have been fatal , for Hugh had been so delicate a child . And then , years later , as a parachutist , Andrew had broken the leg again , rebroken the thigh bone .... In bad weather the leg ached violently , both legs ached mysteriously , and he found walking difficult . But he needed to walk , needed to exercise himself , could not surrender to the temptation to spend every hour at his desk ; he knew that would be disastrous . When he 's old  --  Yvonne thought . When he 's old he will need me even more . And it gave her pleasure to think he would lean more heavily against her , and that she would be equal to it ; she would be equal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disliked weakness  --  had avoided people who might want to be dependent upon her . For some reason she did not feel that way about her husband . He was so strong-willed that any evidence of weakness was endearing ; made him seem very human . When he 's old  --  But of course he was not old . Would not be old for many years . He was in the prime of life now , forty-five years old . Though he seemed at times wearier than he had been , more inclined to repetition , to thinking aloud , he was still an extraordinarily vigorous , quick-witted man , exactly the Andrew Petrie others admired .  --  But he was so hurt , so baffled by this " betrayal , " as he called it !  --  so hurt , he had forgotten even to be angry . It was unlike him . He had made a fool of himself in public  --  but that did not matter , did it ; he had made exaggerated , rather inflammatory statements to the perss before , had he not ?  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was the same man , proud and independent and contemptuous of others ' opinions  --  and in any case , as Yvonne assured him , these matters would soon be forgotten . A public scandalremained in the public eye for only a certain number of daysp303and then would be replaced by another public scandal . There was a pattern to it , almost a kind of rhythm . Did n't he know ? He knew . And the case of the State of New York against the inmates accused of murder in the first degree would not be held for many , many months ; and it would be held in Rochester , far enough away not to matter . Neither the prosecution nor the defense would want to subpoena him , surely  --  ? He was out of it , safely out of it . What did it matter , what did such trivial things matter , everyone knew the state was middling-corrupt , not so bad as some states , of course , but bad enough ; and everyone who knew Andrew personallywould know he had acted in good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand his resigning from the committee and even the rather extreme accusations he had made  --  They would understand , they would understand . And if they did not , why should it matter ? But she did not argue with him . Not that day . Naturally she worshiped him . It had not occurred to her at the time , in such simple terms . One fine bright autumn day she went again to the cemetery , stood at the graveside , waiting , listening , as if for instructions . Had he not taught her so much , so very much ?  --  she must see the individual always in its larger category , always dwarfed and quieted by history , by the universal . Subjectivismwas repellent to him . He was correct , certainly . She understood , she believed . What was the expression , quoted from which historian , " the pathology of subjectivism , " and so she stood at her husband 's graveside awaiting deliverance in the cool sunny autumn air . It was very quiet . Quiet . Birds chattered , automobiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another part of the cemetery . " Andrew  --  ? " He was going to be proved right . Her husband 's young brother Stephen stood at another graveside , some distance away . He was accompanying an old woman who wore a black cloth coat . Yvonne stared . She did not want to stop on the graveled path , did not want to call attention to her/self . Stephen stood beside the old woman , he wore coveralls , he held in one hand a pair of gardening shears and in the other a branch of blossoms  --  no , they could not be blossoms at this time of year  --  small white roses , wild climbing roses , those roses that grew like weeds on the stone walls of the cemetery . He turned , glanced toward her . It was not Stephen ; it was a stranger . Yet he had the sameThe dark hair , the quizzical expressionAnd the shears in one hand , the spray of flowers in the other . A stranger , standing at a stranger 's grave , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew her ? He smiled shyly and said something she could not hear . The old woman , intent upon the grave , noticed nothing . An unemployed foundry worker in his fifties , separated from his wife , confessed to the killing in a downtown precinct late one Saturday night . He was not drunk . They knew he was lying but had difficulty persuading him . He wanted newspaper reporters , he wanted television coverage , he wanted them to telephone his wife and spring the news upon her . They had difficulty persuading him that he lied . A psychiatrist examined the man , questioned him for ten minutes , declared he was a paranoid schizophrenic , possibly quite dangerous . The man was lucid , convincing , sober , had even shaved for the occasion . " Give me a lie detector test ! " he begged . The ambulance arrived the next morning at seven . When he was strapped into a restraining jacket by two tall black orderlies from the state hospital he began to shout : " I 'm innocent ! Hey ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an old magazine I found in  --  " One of the black boys seized him by the scruff of the neck and gave him a good hard shake . The ambulance doors were slammed shut . The ambulance drove off.  |p305He  asked her about the ring and she lifted it to the meager light  --  a hooded stained-glass miniature lantern on their table  --  and told him she had found it many years ago , had discovered it in a restroom in a bus station somewhere in Nebraska , lying on the filthy floor , a lovely little ring , a gift , a gift to her  --  she had been very sick that day , sick to her stomach  --  had been going into public restrooms not knowing what to do  --  and  --  and there , on the floor of this smelly place , there the ring lay , and she had snatched it up , had put it on her finger at once . She spoke quickly , warmly , not really knowing what she said . Eliot was listening without comment . She said it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to someone  --  to another girl , for instance  --  or that it might mean a great deal to someone else ; not until months afterward did that simple thought cross her mind . By then it was too late , she was far from Nebraska . It was too late . And if she had taken the ring to the ticket counter , if she had surrenderedit there  --  probably it would not have been returned to its owner anyway . It was hers , a gift to her . It had been dropped there , had been lying amid crumpled paper towels and loose hairs , awaiting her . Eliot said nothing , as if intimidated by her feeling ; or perhaps by the information she had given him . He stared at the ring but did not take her hand . He was about to take it , to touch it  --  but then he did not , he hesitated . Instead , he stared at the ring . It was made of inexpensive silver , two halfmoonsfacing each other , one lowered slightly so that it fitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook . She realized she had told him too much . She felt a pang of revulsion , of dismay . But he was harmless , not one of the enemy ; perhaps it would not matter . Days pass , weeks pass . The mail begins to subside . If she does not open it every day it accumulates in the sittingp306room . Most of it is forwarded from the New York office of Discourses , some of it comes addressed to her c/o the Police Department , Albany , New York . There are hundreds of clippings : some torn out of newspapers , some sealed in transparent plastic , the size and shape of a bookmark or holy card . Several are mounted on stiff white paper . One came on a sheet of cardboard painted white with an elaborate black border around it done in India ink , painstakingwork that must have taken someone hours ; it was mailedfrom Phoenix , Arizona .

When they began their union it was the beginning of the end , I thought so at the time and am now proved right .

But the noise from the audience was too great , the hisses and boos and isolated shouts , the stamping of feet : a swelling wave , a chaos of waves , washing and breaking upon him . I am merely saying  --  In the words of Emmanuel KantWhen Yvonne telephoned the studio to ask for a private showingof that television program , they told her the tape had been erased . The show itself had gone out live , but only on their local station ; it had never been shown elsewhere in the country ; the tape had been erased almost immediately .

Later , the manager of the station telephoned , to apologize and explain , but Yvonne had interrupted him  --  what did she care for his apologies and explanations ? She wanted to see the tape , the next day if possible . She and Eliot went one morning at ten o'clock to the fifteenth floor of the Schumacher Building , where the educational television network had its local studios . They watched the tape in a windowlessroom , seated at the head of a long conference table ; the televisionset was attached to the opposite wall . His face in that rectangular frame  --  his features and his voice so distorted , flattened , trivializedThe shock of seeing him , again aliveThe surprise of , the panic of " I ca n't stand this , " Eliot said.  | " Leave me alone , go away , " Yvonne said .

" I 'll wait for you outside  --  " " Yes . Yes . Whatever you want , " Yvonne said , not aware of him . There was a former state legislator on the committee , a Democrat , a practicing veterinarian from the countryside near Catskill ; he was Andrew 's only supporter . There was a civil liberties attorney from New York City , as articulate and impassioned as Andrew himself , very contemptuous of him . There was a shrill black woman , another woman from the area who directed a New Opportunities program , and a professor of political science from the State University . There was a businessman , there was even a clergyman whose denomination Yvonne did not know . None of these people were very real to her . They were not real at all . The moderator 's voice competed with Andrew 's  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she tried to concentrate . But his presence , his voice got in the way of his words , his living essence drowned out everything else . Was he dead ? Was that death !  --  It was not . But the moderator continued to speak and finally the camera focused upon him . He was smiling nervously , stupidly . He was begging the studio audience to quiet down . There were still boos , isolated shouts  --  a sense of disorder  --  abandon . The moderatorseemed both shocked and enticed by what was happening . He was a youthfully dressed man of middle age whom Yvonne believed she knew  --  had met once in a great crowd of people  --  but she could not remember his name .

The issue did not matter . What did the Glasberg riot matter , what did the dead and wounded prisoners matter , or the prison guards who had died , or the mother of one of the dead prisoners  --  a black woman from Syracuse  --  interviewed so poignantly by the press ? They imagined they were important . They imagined their cause was important . But they were not important , their cause did not matter ,  |p313exce|pt  as it might be snatched up and used by others  --  by their " friends "  --  by Andrew 's enemies .

And how humiliating that Andrew should be involved ! It almost seemed to her that his image on the screen  --  on that dwarfish , vulgar screen and his voice competing with the others  --  it almost seemed to her deathly , a kind of death  --  the mere fact that he had acquiesced to appear with those others . Of course he was superior to the rest of the committee . That was obvious , there was no doubt about that . His manner  --  his intelligence  --  hisrefusal to qualify his position or back down when challenged  --  his refusal to become emotional like the others : it was obvious , his superiority . She did not really mind that so few people honored it . They were only dissembling , pretending not to recognizewhat was obvious ; they were liars , hypocrites . They were deluded .

Not the assassin , for his kind had no physical courage , but one who encouraged the assassin and afterward , reading of Andrew 's murder , reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , wanting to know every detail , every humiliating detail , afterward he would be gloat/ing  --  digesting the news as if it were a dinner that pleased him . And his life was words , nothing but words ! He erected an abstract tower of words about an event that , for him , in his life , was simplyanother abstraction  --  what did he care about anything except the erection of his abstract tower , the triumph of his words ?

How his enemies had triumphed that day !  --  and continued to triumph . Perhaps , at this very moment , at the moment at which Andrew Petrie was being so rudely dismissed , the assassin knew what he would do ; perhaps at this very instant , the fleeting instant this particular part of the program was recordedWhoever had killed him was present , had listened , had been moved by the gross animal passions of the crowd  --   |p316There  , it came to him suddenly , there is the man , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other .

The pain was such a surprise , so incredible a sensation  --  she had been turning over and over in her mind a conversation she and Andrew had had , walking along the beach after breakfast  --  his passionate admission that , for him , ideas were the only reality  --  the only permanent reality  --  the rational side of mankind the only sacred side  --  never really explored except by a few individuals , isolated , uncertain of their connection with one another : the future of mankind was only through reason , logic , awakened capacities in the brain that were now dormant in nearly everyone .

And then  --  And now  --  She had been thinking of  --  had been rehearsing in her mind the several objections and questions she wanted to make  --  What did Kant mean by , why was he so obscure in , could it be interpreted thatThe pain , suddenly . Her left foot . How quickly it had happened , and how the blood spurted out onto the sand ! Maine . Rails Bay . A lodge they had rented for a week . It was a honeymoon of a sort . They had been married seven months earlier , had had no time to get away , Andrew had been committed to so much work  --  so many public appearances , public responsibilities . Then , in September , they had gone away . The weather was poor : rain at least once a day , always rather murky , misty , cold . Sometimesthe sun penetrated the clouds with a beautiful , harsh splendor  --  sometimes the entire day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved it passionately . And Andrew , in old clothes , un/shaven , at times playful and childlike  --  Andrew had seemed so happy  --  for the first four days , at least , he had seemed so untroubled  --  hadbeen able to detach himself from his immediate work and was taking the time to reread certain books he had loved as a young manThen she had stepped on the glass , then the blood spurted out , so suddenly , foolishly . For a moment she was stunned  --  even the pain did not really register . Then she saw what had happened : for some reason she stooped to pick up the piece of glass , green glass , she stared at it for an instant and then threw it hard , hard , out into the ocean  --  tears of anger starting into her eyes . That so foolishan accident should happen to her , to her ! She had not wanted to tell him , but the pain was too great , the bleeding profuse . She limped back to the lodge , dizzy , hoping she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crouched over , hunched over , like an animal ; unable to stop the bleeding by pressing against it with her fingers , unable to control what was happening ; unable to quite comprehend how an instant 's innocent distractionhad led to ... . She called for him . She surrendered , called for him , there was fear in her voice she could not disguise : Andrew ! she called . Andrew , Andrew ! So he hurried to her , he exclaimed when he saw the wound , he helped her up  --  walked her into the house , into the old-fashioned bathroom  --  exclaiming , murmuring  --  comforting  --  almost scolding her , as one might scold a child to distract it from panic . How had it happened ! But she must not step on it , must try not to step on it ! Look at the dirt , the sand ! How had it happened , such a terrible accident ? He sat her on the edge of the tub , a high , white enamel tub , he turned on the faucets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the while as he cleansed the wound  --  squatting on his haunches  --  breathing heavily  --  a slight stammer as he comforted her , instructed her to close her eyes , not to watch the blood . He washed the wound with soap and water . the dabbed disinfectant on it . He rubbed white ointment on it , like cold cream , but the blood continued to flow and he had to keep the water running , all the while steadying her with one arm , talking to her , comforting her . It was not dangerous , really ! It was only about two inches long ! Not very deep ! Only a freak accident , itp318would not happen again , he 'd rake every inch of the beach again , he would be more thorough than he 'd been , if only she would close her eyes and relax , the blood would stop in a moment , now he was pressing a cloth against it , now it was nearly stopped , she should lean against him , shift her weight against him rather than back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " It wo n't happen again . I can bandage it and we 'll drive you into Rails Bay and have a doctor look at it  --  " " Is the bleeding stopped ? " Yvonne said . " It 's slowed , it 's nearly stopped . " "  --  I do n't need a doctor then , " she said . " I do n't want a doctor . " "  --  a freak accident , really . It wo n't happen again . What was it , a piece of glass ? Was it a piece of glass ? " "  --  piece of glass  --  " " I thought I 'd raked this area so thoroughly  --  you and I had both raked it  --  " " I threw the glass away , " Yvonne said . " I threw it into the ocean . " It was a freak accident , was n't it , " Andrew muttered . He seemed shaky , now that she was herself again ; he smiled up at her , his eyes more gray than green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent , as if washed clean . He wore old shapeless trousers and a pullover sweater worn at the elbows and tennis shoes withoutsocks ; he was dressed like any other man . He was dressed like an ordinary man . " Imagine if a child had stepped on the glass , " one of them said . "  --  it wo n't happen again , it was a freak accident . " " The glass is gone ?  --  It wo n't happen again . " Afterward Yvonne made an effort to walk naturally . She wore sandals , there was plenty of room for the bandage , the wound was not cramped and did not hurt very much . Whenever he asked her about it , she said it did not hurt . It was healing , she said . Andrew decided to cut their vacation short , to drive back to Albany a day early  --  and Yvonne acquiesced , not liking Maine so much now  --  and when he suggested she see a doctor , their doctor Allan Jamison  --  she said there was no need , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave her no trouble . Eventually that was so.  |p319The  telephone rang . Very late at night  --  past two in the morning  --  butshe had not been asleep , had been sitting up against the headboard of the bed , a pillow bunched up behind her . She answeredthe phone on the first ring because the noise was so ugly . She answered the phone but did not speak , not at once . She listened . " Yvonne ? Yvonne ? Is this Yvonne Petrie ? " The voice was familiar . But so many voices were familiar . " Yvonne ? Is this Yvonne ?  --  This is Hugh calling . This is Hugh . Are you all right ? Yvonne ? " " Yes , " she said finally . " Ah , Yvonne ! I knew it was you  --  I knew by the very quality of  --  the texture of the silence  --  It was so intense a silence , so stubborn and cruel !  --  but how are you , my dear , are you well ? " " Why are you calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  is it late ? I 've lost track of time , " the voice went on cheerfully , with a minimal , joking attempt at self-censure . " Surely there is no need to respect ordinary chronology in our lives ?  --  in our lives ? Your late husband often worked round the clock , did n't he , was n't that one of his character traits , the ability to work with great concentration for long periods of time ?  --  and then catnap , like Edison and other men of genius ? Like Winston Churchill too , they say . And Lyndon Johnson . So you must be accustomed to having day turned into night and night into day and  --  and  --  that sort of thing . " Yvonne said nothing . She saw by the luminous , pale green hands of the clock on the night table that it was 2:25 . Her own watch , a bracelet watch studded with small diamonds , lay nearby ; it showed only 12:05 ; it must have stopped . Eliot 's watch , an electronic watch with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  blue with innumerable black and white dots and clock hands that were mere slivers of light  --  lay at the very edge of the table where one of them had put it . " I 'm calling , frankly , because I have been worrying about you , " Hugh was saying . The line was surprisingly clear for a long-distance call ; the man 's bright , lurching , insinuating voice soundedp320as if it were in the room with her . When Yvonne did not reply , the voice drawled something about being frankly worried about the other members of the family  --  the close relatives , that is  --  since there was so much madness loose in the world today , so much inspired envy and cruelty  --  had she seen the Times this morning ?  --  that is , yesterday morning ?  --  and it was obvious to him that whoever had killed Andrew was a madman and might very well have a plan  --  but of course she knew all this , she was intelligentenough to know this  --  certainly her late husband had educatedher into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ? " Yes , " Yvonne said . " Why are you telephoning me ? " " But I wanted to hear your voice !  --  I 've been calling off and on all day , Yvonne , hoping to find you at home  --  of course it was always possible that you were n't in Albany  --  but somehow I sensed  --  and kept calling every hour or hour and a half  --  I think  --  and now it 's very late at night , is n't it ?  --  somehow it seems to be very late at night .  --  I hope I 'm not disturbing you ? Are you alone ?  --  But naturally you would be alone  --  it 's very late  --  but I 'm puzzled about why you refused to answer the phone for so many hours  --  " Eliot was awake now . His expression showed alarm , apprehensionrather than curiosity ; he sat up at once , blinking . Yvonne looked at him . She smiled her quick , effortless , rather critical smile , that he should know there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appealingly at her , as if trying to read her thoughts . Yvonne lay her hand carelessly over the receiver , not bothering to muffle her voice . " You should be leaving , should n't you ? Should n't you leave ? It 's so late  --  " Eliot stood , still apprehensive , shy , not turning his back to her  --  easing out of the bedclothes with a peculiar subdued grace , as if he were afraid to make any sudden movement . He stared at her , smiling with one corner of his mouth , trying to read her thoughts , still stuporous with sleep , groggy . Yvonne believed he did not know , really , where he was . She sensed his mind working , thoughts and half-thoughts flooding his brain  --  and yet he did not know , could not remember . His genial , prematurely lined boy 's face seemed to her now almost pitiable . But then too he was probably a little sick ; he had had so much to drink.  |p321He  turned away , still very silent , and intimidated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went stealthily to the far end of the bedroom and , while listening to her brother-in-law 's chatter , Yvonne watched him mistake the closet door for the bathroom door , open it , start in and then stop , as if befuddled ; then he went to the right door. "  --  someone 's there ? Is someone there ? " Hugh was saying . " I heard you speak to someone  --  did n't I ? " " There 's no one here , " Yvonne said . " I 'm alone . I 'm in bed . Who would be here ? There 's no one . " " I thought I heard  --  Unless I 'm imagining  --  " " Who would be here ? " Yvonne said dryly. "  --  You people flatter yourselves . " " What ? Who ? What people ? " Hugh said . When Yvonne did not reply he said in a more normal voice that he had heard  --  it might be just rumor  --  since it had been Doris who told himconfidentially  --  he had heard that arrests were imminent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But of course you would know  --  ? " Involuntarily , Yvonne brought her head back against the carved headboard . Her heartbeat responded at once , quickening . But she showed no emotion , no curiosity ; she only murmured a vague assent . " Arrests are imminent , " Hugh said softly . " And it 's supposed to be a surprise . . . I gather . I mean I gather that . Have they been questioningyou again ? " " No. " " ... of course Doris could be misinformed . It depends upon her source of information : sometimes she hears of things through Arnold , who has some good connections up there since one of his partners handles the District Attorney 's father-in-law 's investments ; sometimes it 's through Harvey ; but sometimes it 's just the girl who does her hair .... Are you sure you 're alone ? We do n't feel alone . We feel as if someone is overhearing this conversation  --  Imean I feel as if  --  " " It could be possible that the phone is tapped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  What did you say ?  --  Do n't you mind ? " " Why should I mind ? " Yvonne said . " But  --  One 's privacy  --  I would have thought  --  Andrew was such a classic libertarian , was n't he ?  --  constitutional rights , states ' rights , the integrity of the individual  --  did n't he come out againstp322wiretapping very strongly ? Such an invasion of privacy  --  something obscene about it . Do n't you mind ? " " Why are you calling me , Hugh ? " Yvonne asked . But that was an error : she had called him by his name . " I  --  I 've been  --  I only  --  I 've been so  --  The thought of you has been  --  You see , at our very first meeting  --  at that reception for my father  --  our very first meeting , Yvonne  --  I somehow knew  --  sensed  --  of course we did n't have much to say to each other  --  I do n't believe we even liked each other  --  a sentimental allegiance on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poor Willa  --  a sad , sad case !  --  you should have pity on her , I think . If you have time for that sort of thing .  --  Do you think the phone is tapped ? What should we do in that case ? " " We could hang up , " Yvonne said . " But  --  but  --  But we 're not saying anything wicked , are we ?  --  and of course we  --  we are  --  We 're both quite  --  It 's reasonable that I should telephone my sister-in-law occasionally and inquire after her health and  --  and  --  Someone saw you the other day and said you looked very tired , Yvonne . One of the cousins who promptly told  --  who was it ?  --  Pamela , I think  --  oh that girl is very . very jealous of you  --  I sensed it three years ago and I sensed it just the other day , it seems , in June  --  that day seems so recent  --  the funeral , I mean  --  that pack of ghouls crowded into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so very different from them , from all of them . I do n't know if I detest the Petries , Yvonne , but I certainly feel an almost physical revulsion for them  --  my skin crawls  --  does yours ?  --  Anyway it came by way of Pamela to Doris : you look rather tired . Are you sleeping well ? Arc you eating well ? You do n't brood over the past , do you ?  --  I mean excessively ? I 've made every effort in my own life to mourn the dead as an act of piety  --  but I have no superstitious awe of death  --  I 'm quite fearless , actually . I 've been called reckless , even . Yvonne ? Do you think the phone is really tapped ? " " I do n't know , " Yvonne said . " But why should it matter ? We have nothing to say to each other , do we ? " "  --  and what else was it , apart from your health  --  looking tired , they said  --  ' haggard ' was Doris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just wishful thinking on that creature 's part . Sorrow becomes you . It becomes most women .  --  Your health , yes , and  --  and your fi- ! uncial condition ?  --  it 's quite reasonable that I should inquire about  --  " " My finances are too complicated , " Yvonne said , " for me to know what condition they 're in.  --  But now I think we should  --  " " The main reason for my call  --  The reason I am calling at I his particular moment  --  Yes , I understand about the financial complications !  --  my checking account is a chaos  --  my savings account is in rather better condition  --  money comes into it automatically , you know  --  so I need n't fuss . Money has never been important to me , but I 'm grateful  --  I have to admit  --  I 'm grateful I have quite enough to live on comfortably  --  so long as I resist the temptation to dip into my capital . But such matters are  --  are n't very  --  are n't very interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephoning , Yvonne , at what turns out to be surprisingly late at night  --  The real reason  --  " " Yes ? " "  --  is that I  --  I  --  Did you get a letter I sent recently ? " " I do n't remember . " " Ah , you get so much mail ! Yes , I understand .  --  And so  --  well  --  the fact is  --  I believe I would like to see you , " he said excitedly . " I would like to see you . Just to talk . There 's so much between us , so much unsaid  --  if it could be possible for  --  " " I must hang up , " Yvonne said uneasily . She had begun to shiver . She lay atop the silk cover ; she was wearing a floor-length robe of light wool . But the room was rather chilly . " Yes , it might be possible  --  sometime  --  after New Year 's , maybe  --  So much is happening now and I 'm so busy and  --  " " Yvonne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that 's preposterous . Preposterous . In the light of the fact that I am , at this moment , no more than a minute away from you  --  two minutes at the most  --  ca n't you have pity , ca n't you be reasonable  --  " " Two minutes ? " Yvonne said . She shivered again . She gripped the receiver against her ear more closely . " Yes . I 'm just two minutes away , I 'm telephoning from a booth in the Highlands Motor Inn  --  just across the street from  --  I can practically see your building , dear , if I crouch down a little and  --  " " What ? " Yvonne said . She swung her legs around quickly . " I do n't  --  What  --  " " Did you think I was in New York , Yvonne ? No , no . I shouldp324have explained . But it 's so devilishly tricky talking to you , dear , you seem to lead me through a  --  a veritable maze  --  a rat 's maze  --  But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frankly , to dealing with  --  with young women like yourself  --  but I do n't at all mind , not at all !  --  your devices . The fact is , dear , I am in Albany ; I 'm a mere two-minute stroll from you ; now may I see you , perhaps for a nightcap ? There are innumerable  --  " " What do you mean , " Yvonne said , frightened , " what do you  --  Why are you  --  You have no right to do this , " she said , now angry , " spying on me  --  it 's degrading , I wo n't tolerate it !  --  how can you have come to Albany to see me without calling first ? I do n't even know you  --  I do n't know you  --  " " But I am calling first , " Hugh protested . " What is this but a telephone call ? And it 's all so unnecessary , since I 'm so close  --  and most of the subtleties in a relationship are lost in a  --  over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are certain things I want to tell you in person  --  things you really should know . I think you 'll find my counsel very , very valuable  --  and  --  Yvonne ? " She began to speak rapidly and coldly . She told him she was sorry , very sorry . But she could not see him . And she must hangup " Tomorrow ? Tomorrow for breakfast ? I 'll be right here  --  I ' 11 be right in the vicin  --  " But she told him she was sorry : she could not see him . She would be working all morning . There was a luncheon at noon  --  the executive committee of the Council of the Humanities , Arts , and Communications  --  and in the afternoon she had an appointment with someone  --  and she hoped to get in an hour or two more , working on the manuscript  --  and then there was a reception for the French consul  --  and the next day was filled also  --  and then she was going out of town  --  and then , on Sunday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could n't refusethemHe said something further , but she was not listening . She was excited , frightened . It occurred to her that she had made an error , long ago  --  something to do with this man  --  a thought she had had about him but had n't taken seriously  --  she had lost her instinctive powers  --  something was going from her , fading , draining away  --  suspicion lay very lightly on the surface of her being now , skitteringacross her skin  --  and she stood back from it , did not heed it  --   |p325the  numbness was rising in her again as it had risen on that day  --  detached and cynical and fatalistic  --  and she could not seize it , could not get hold of it as in the past . Then she had known what to do , had always known . Her mind worked beautifully , brilliantly . I t came alive by solving problems . Now the problems arose but were strangely fragmented  --  now she could not synthesize them  --  it had something to do with that black boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the realization , suddenly , that  --  the deathly certain knowledge that  --  He would die , and it was not in her power to prevent " Leave me alone ! " she cried , interrupting him . " There must be some mistake !  --  What do you want from me ? " Her last words were pleading , almost musical . " What do you want from me  --  all of you ? " Afterward , at the door , Eliot asked who had telephoned . Yvonne was still upset . She held the robe closed , the embroideredcollar up close to her chin . She said reluctantly that it was her brother-in-law  --  one of them  --  Hugh  --  the cartoonist , was he acquainted with  --  ? Eliot shook his head . He was still groggy , blinking slowly . He said he had never met Hugh  --  but Andrew had mentioned him once at the office  --  was irritated by a caricature the man had done , of someone in Congress  --  a friend of Andrew 's . No , he had never met Hugh Petrie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be insane , " Eliot said , smiling , " so that he would be absolved from  --  from ordinary life , I think it was . Hugh , was it ? I do n't remember . " " Pretending ? Is he pretending ? " Yvonne said . She laughed . He tried to join her , but failed . He smiled . He reached for her hand and she gave it to him , knowing it was very cold , the fingers almost numb , lifeless . " Good night , " he said . " Good night , " said Yvonne.  |p326After  the private showing of the program , Yvonne had gone out to find Eliot waiting for her , and their eyes snatched at each other  --  she saw he was still upset , ashen . By now she was calmer ; she had gone to the television set to turn it off when Andrew concludedhis summation ; she had had no interest in the last five minutes . In the room , walking slowly about the long table , she had forced herself to be calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awaste of her life 's energy , her vitality , a draining of her will . She knew , she knew . Anger that went the way of ordinary , unproductive emotion , anger that dissolved helplessly into sorrow  --  she knew very well it was idiotic , a wasteThat she might break down , might weep openly  --  that she might become hysterical , as others did  --  what a victory that would be for their enemies ! Eliot asked her to have lunch with him . He was a slender , rather boyishly good-looking man in his early thirties , of moderate height , with prematurely graying hair ; at times his appeal was strongly , and again rather boyishly , intellectual  --  for he had been , at Dartmouth , Andrew 's outstanding student , many years ago  --  had writtena Master 's thesis on the dizzyingly numerous influences and pressures that went into one of the more recent Amendments to the Constitution , a small book that had subsequently been published ; at other times his appeal was childlike , his gaze liquid , questioning , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  breaking off in midsentence , shy , yet rather clever  --  knowing he was inadequate and the other , whoever it might be , had all the power . He had been working with Andrew on Discourses for over a decade , had been acting editor for over a year , and was now editor-in-chief . Yvonne had met him several times but had been rather amused and irritated by his manner  --  still a student , still so obsequious to his elders  --  and clever , too , wonderfully clever  --  for by minimizing his own existence he inflated others , certain others  --  like Andrew , whom everyone courted in some way , but without Eliot 's finesse . She had known at once what he was doing , had known from the very first  --  seated across from him at a lengthy dinner party  --  and again , more recently  --  back in Februaryp327in March  --  at the Greasons  --  drawing him out , almost interrogatinghim , sly herself , teasing , feeling a kind of pleasure that so clever and probably so brilliant a man should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he had a full-time teaching job at a small college along the Hudson , which Andrew had arranged for him  --  so little reward in editing Discourses  --  worrying about subscriptions , bills unpaid , threatening letters and telephone calls and even libel suits : still he seemed to love it , craved Andrew 's praise , never questioned Andrew 's authority . So Yvonne had sensed something in him kin to her , to herself , and it had pleased her to draw him out  --  as if she were a kind of princess , a noble lady  --  condescending to ask him about his life and receiving an account of him  --  of his achievements  --  with intense , methodical interest , noting how reluctantly he spoke of himself , bow he depended upon her to question him , to draw him out . He gave the impression of being respectful , of being deferential . Perhaps he really was . She had neither liked nor disliked him . At the Greasons ' dinner party she could not really remember him  --  or herself  --  and she did not care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sort of nostalgic re-creation of the past , which might be dangerous . At the Greasons ' , for one thing , Andrew had been extraordinarilycharming  --  witty and provocative and energetic  --  giving , at least , the appearance of being energetic  --  for he had been quite troubled all that winter , with the citizens ' committee and with other matters , public and private ; it was to be his last dinnerparty , his last party among friends , and Yvonne did not care to recall it  --  not at this time . Eliot Stacey had been there , handsomelydressed , gap-toothed when he smiled , shy , sweet , with a young , reticent wife , her pale blond hair worn artlessly short , a small , pursed mouth , eyes that darted from face to face  --  a former student of Eliot 's , evidently  --  too young for this company , out of place , uneasy . Yvonne had felt sorry for her , had been irritated with Eliot for being so oblivious of her , but when she spoke to the girl  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to freeze , like a frightened animal , a wild creature confronted with an enemy : Yvonne 's presence , Yvonne 's genuine interest in her , evidently made her very uneasy . So Yvonne had let her go , had not pursued any conversation , had been dully and unaccountably annoyed with the husband , with Eliot , who spokep328at times in a way that echoed Andrew so obviously , it was embarrassing  --  evenusing his hands in certain gestures , a timid mimicry of Andrew . But he was exceptionally intelligent ; he was quickwitted , he knew a great deal about political theory and even more about politics , could argue well , would not back down , never said anything extravagant or risky . She respected his intelligence , she liked him for that . The marriage was possibly a disappointment to Eliot  --  so Yvonne sensed , without curiosity  --  and perhaps he was not to blame for preferring the company of others to that of his young wife . She passed no personal judgment on him , neither liking nor disliking him . When Andrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yvonne always assented ; but she did not offer any judgment of her own . Andrew 's people had , in her imagination , a certain indefinable privilege . They were superior to her somehow . They were always superior to her . They were never really to be ' challenged , never subjected to any sort of emotional assessment ; they possessed a mysterious authority she herself did not have . " My father was a police captain in a precinct in Boston , " Eliot was saying slowly . " You would n't know , probably  --  would n't be familiar with  --  names like Brewer , Follett  --  Hanrahan in the Treasury Department  --  No , I would n't think so , and it was kind of Andrew never to tell you . He never , never brought my backgroundup to me . I was an undergraduate at the time everything broke , the various scandals  --  exposes  --  a one-man grand jury was handing down indictments of everyone , friend and enemy alike  --  nothing could stop him once he got going . And of course things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Eliot said , looking at her . He seemed unaware of his surroundings . Though he had had only one drink , he spoke with a certain belabored care , as if he were drunk . Yvonne tried not to notice the way his mouth twisted as he spoke . She did not want to imitate him , she did not want suddenly to start crying . " . . . My father was one of those men who accepted everything , " Eliot said , " he had a certain goodnatured , crafty acceptance of  --  of everything . Nothing could surprisehim , he liked to say how immune he was , how much he knew about human nature . He was n't a bad man , just coarse . I do n't hate him . I never did hate him . It was just that he was part of  --  people like him are part of  --  the corruption , the bribery  --  the sickening deals and  --  Nothing surprises them , they make ap329show of being tolerant  --  so wise to the world  --  And of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play along with it  --  it means 1 lore to them than anything else , playing along with others , going along with whatever is being done  --  I was an undergraduate at Dartmouth , a junior . Andrew taught a course in political science that was very popular  --  and there was an honors seminar that grew out of it that only seniors were supposed to take  --  but he allowed me to register for it . And  --  and  --  It was at the time of  --  Everything broke , " he said , his mouth twisting , " everything was exposed back home . I got a telephone call from one of my brothers . I knew what my father was like but I did n't know how deeply he was into it  --  I thought a lot of his remarks were just jokes , boasts  --  I suppose I did n't really think about it , I did n't want to think about it . He was so good-natured , he had so many friends  --  He drank quite a bit but was never  --  Everybody thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices , especially those that arc politically appointed , were supposed to be supported by graft  --  as if it were a law of nature  --  because their salaries were n't much and they did n't have expense accounts . They tried to distinguish between clean ' and dirty ' money . That was the talk , that was the way they talked . But always joking , hinting , alluding to things , to complicated relationships  --  liaisons  --  that sort of thing  --  as if it were all , all  --  " he said , his voice going hollow , for a moment unable to think what he meant ; then going on , with that childlike grimness , "  --  all illicit games , sexual games  --  adulterous affairs carried on by men , betraying one another and vowing faithfulness to one another and spying on one another and  --  in the long run  --  forgiving one another because it was all exciting , you know ?  --  and the way the city was run  --  the way all cities are run . My father was one of the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precinct captain . There were judges , a whole string of corrupt judges , really cynical bastards  --  and so arrogant  --  all of them Democrats , though probably  --  I mean  --  they would have been anything , probably  --  they had no political commitments or ideals or awareness of ideals . My father thought he was privileged , being taken up by these people . He thought it was like being voted into a club  --  into one of the downtown clubs  --  and then I do n't think he had very much  --  he was n't very  --  he was n't very inteIligent , " Eliot said . " So he went along with it , let himself be used , they said at the hearings that he had been involved forp330eleven years  --  eleven years !  --  and it all came out , it broke wide open , that was when a man named Follett was killed  --  he had turned state 's witness and was killed  --  But the name means nothing to you , does it , " he said slowly , now taking Yvonne 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . You do n't know and you do n't care . Andrew knew  --  he called me into his office for a conference , he knew very well what was happening , he knew everything  --  read a half-dozen papers , read constantly !  --  he knew what was happeningbut he did n't even offer me any saccharine advice  --  he just let me cry  --  he was n't embarrassed , just let me sit there crying in his office  --  when the telephone rang he did n't answer it , when someone knocked on the door he did n't answer it  --  just let me stay in there with him until  --  until finally I was all right and we could talk and we could even talk about graft and corruption and how the climate can change , almost overnight sometimes , how certain people are left suddenly powerless  --  how their enemies rush to get them . He made me see what had happened . But in theory , in theory . It was something that happened so often  --  it was part of a pattern  --  nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unintelligent people fall into  --  manipulated by others  --  no idea of what is really going on . They are used , exploited , because there is nothing in them of their own . They do n't believe in anything . They have no principles , no ideals . They do n't even know about the existence of such things ! They have no conception of history , of the tradition of their own offices , they do n't know how their governments were formed and they do n't give a damn and it 's like a merry-go-round to them , a ride , a game  --  they ca n't be blamed , in a way  --  they do n't know what they are doing . Andrew told me there are always people like that , especially in city and county politics . It was n't just my father , it was a type , a personality  --  a certain kind of jovial good-natured shrewd man , you know ?  --  he 's all-forgiving , he 's very tolerant  --  really he does n't give a damn . He just does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to be sorry after he 's caught  --  he can be destroyed , in fact  --  like my father  --  but he never grasps what he 's done , he never knows how he has violated a communal code  --  a principle of  --  He never knows , he 's not intelligent enough to know . The typical politician is this man , this man I am talking about , he 's shrewder than my father but there 's the same emptiness in him .  --  But the Petries are so different , " Eliot said , leaning forward againstp331the table , now grasping Yvonne 's forearm . " Andrew of course most of all  --  but his father , too , a very high-ranking judge  --  might have been named to the Supreme Court except for politics  --  and other Petries in public office  --  but you know all this yourself , how could you not know !  --  you must think I 'm crazy or drunk or  --  but I ca n't help it  --  I do n't have anyone left now , anyone to talk with  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hours  --  for hours  --  he 'd have me outline the argument of one of the articles the magazine had received and then we 'd discuss it  --  he was always so kind , so courteous  --  he allowed me to speak even when I was going in the wrong direction , and he was never sarcastic when he pointed out my mistakes  --  he was never sarcastic with me . Of course he could be devastating with other people , he could be murderous . But never with me , he was so gentle with me , he liked me very much , Yvonne , did n't he ?  --  it meant so much when he invited me to join the magazine 's staff  --  and then appointing me acting editor  --  though he knew it would antagonize certain other editors who imagined they were next in line . He liked me , Yvonne , did n't he ? Did he talk about me with you ?  --  And now , now , " he said , suddenly exhausted , " now I have no one to talk with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He kept them in line , you know , the John Birchers and the others  --  he could handle them but I  --  I  --  I do n't think I  --  I do n't think I will be equal to- " He loved Andrew , Yvonne thought . " I do n't think I will be equal to it , " Eliot said . The hum of conversations , the eating and drinking , eating and drinking , gusto of men maneuvering forks and knives : what do we want from this , Yvonne wondered , what will come of it ? Eliot was silent now . He stared at his plate . " Did he live and die for this , do you think ? " Yvonne asked . " This ? What ? " He bent forward , not hearing . Yvonne indicated the restaurant  --  the other customers . " Is the smoke bothering you ? " Eliot asked . He loved Andrew , Yvonne thought in a kind of triumph , he loves him .... Someone close to her as a brother , an intimate friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They said good-by.  |p332They  parted . A few hours later he telephoned and wanted to see her . " Yes , " Yvonne said . He brought a bottle of Scotch with him  --  he 'd been drinking , he said , since noon . Yet she liked him now . She liked him very much . He sat beside her and talked and his entire face twisted , took on a brutal , infantile expression , tiny near-invisible lines like a mask fitted over his guileless boy 's face . You love him , Yvonne thought , more than I do . Later they lay in each other 's arms . They lay atop the bedspread , not undressed . He relived that Sunday evening : where he had been when his wife came to tell him the news of the assassination , what he had felt , what his first reaction had been . He relived the night , the following day , the following days . He relivedthe funeral . And the hours that followed  --  when it seemed certain that , at any time , the killers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrest , the arrest ! And then the long dull agony of days , weeks , weeks . Weeks and now months , now it was autumn and a new group of legislators convening and Andrew dead , still dead , and nothing changed  --  the enemy still free  --  free and jeering at them . He could not bear it ! He despised them all ! He sobbed . Yvonne held him . She did not like the sickish whiskey odor of his breath , or the heat of his body , or the spasmodictwitchings of his muscles ; but she held him , she comforted him . She too wept , but not from grief ; from exhaustion . She hoped he would sleep but he continued to squirm in her arms , he buried his damp face against her throat , he moaned of the injustice .. . the film he had seen not long ago of the Glasberg riot , the ostensibleliberation of the prisoner-held prison by the Governor 's guardsmen , rows of soldiers equipped with gas masks and rifles , rows of black prisoners stepping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coming hesitantly forward to surrender . . . and the sudden staccato noise of the bullets , the unarmed men shot down in the yard , in the mud . . . the sound of their screams barely recorded , so thin , delicate , piercing . distant . Then the guardsmenrushed upon the rest of them with clubs . Then the film went blank , the camera must have been smashed . No more popping of bullets , no more faint surprised screams , just silence . Silence . Andrewhad not known . Andrew had been betrayed . Everyone lied afterward : the Commander of the National Guard and the warden and the warden 's men and the Commissioner of Police and thep333Deputy Commissioner and the Prison Authority and their attorneysand the Governor and the Lieutenant-Governor and -- Everyone , everyone had lied . Now he was dead and could never redeem himself . Yvonne comforted him . Of course Andrew had redeemed himself ! Long before he died he had  --  She pressed her cheek against Eliot 's head , against the top of his head ; she tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babyish , his arms and legs jerking with grief . His clothing damp . She hoped he would not be sick to his stomach  --  she did not think he was accustomed to drinking so much . The sobbing abated . He fell into a deep sleep . He left the apartment at about a quarter to three . When he was gone , Yvonne remembered his wife . Then she remembered the way he had looked at her , saying good-by . Perhaps he imagined they were lovers . . . ? " He will never know , " she thought . She sits at the desk reading an essay on Durkheim that is crossreferencedto Nietzsche and Thomas Jefferson and Carlyle and Marx and the Tao Te Ching and Lewis Carroll . The typing is poor , the margins very narrow , she has no room to make pencil marks , she finds it difficult to follow the line of thought from one phrase to another ; the sentences are complex , convoluted , runonas if for dramatic effect  --  something hypnotic about them , unsettling . She is thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see it , she remembers that it is the place terminal patients are put  --  the ones who never get any visitors . They are moved there , relegated there , the roof is made of corrugated tin and in the summer sun the air heats to one hundred degrees , the stench is unbearable . Grandma ? Grandma ? She is in the skirt and blouse the Beattie girl gave her because they were too worn ; she is back in French Creek , back for the first visit in a long time , she is talkingnow to one of the student nurses , the girl is not much olderp334than Yvonne but has a job , a uniform , a smart clipped manner explaining that the doctors are busy in the regular hospital and so are the nurses and what does she expect ?  --  what does she expect ? Only when she is alone again , safe and alone , does she begin to cry . Coarse ugly sobs . No inflection to them . Ugly , ang . Very ' angry . The woman blinked at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did not seem to feel the heat and Yvonne is not weeping out of grief but out of anger . She has never wept out of grief , only out of anger . She does not mourn him . She is mourning his absence , the loss of his power . His name , his prestige . His essence . She does not mourn him because , in a sense , he is only temporarily gone . He is out of the room , out of the apartment for a few days , perhaps there is a speaking engagement somewhere , an honorary degree to be conferred on him , there is something happening to him , with him , about him , no need to mourn him . She weeps with anger sometimes when she discovers how they are telling lies about him  --  pretending to eulogize him , using the opportunity to tell vicious lies . She is not weeping out of grief but out of anger . It is cleansing , it is good for her . For weeks now she has not been well  --  not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night ; occasionaldizziness , loss of balance , loss of appetite ; sweating and shivering ; waves of nausea , though never any vomiting . She weeps with anger , but it is a tearless weeping . It is cleansing , it is healthy and good for her , like retching  --  but it is dry , spasmodic , painful . Their lies ! Their innuendos ! Their jealousies ! She does not mourn him , she is not in mourning . She goes out , to luncheons , to meetings . She flies to New York City to meet with Andrew 's tax attorneys ; she spends the weekend with friends in a hunting lodge near Lake George . The apartment is painted and she makes arrangements for the sofas , chairs , and carpets to be cleaned . She speaks with the Police Commissioner and with the District Attorney . She attends a reception at the Governor 's mansion , she sits at Andrew 's desk eight hours a day , she makes an appointment with Dr. Jamison and is then forced to cancel it , having been invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the World Relations Forum in early November . She is not a featured speaker  --  they are an elderly Belgian nobleman and a chancellor of one of the California state collegesp335and a lively , witty black woman in her sixties , evidently a controversialfigure on the West Coast , president of the Oakland Board of Education ; and a senator from the south , one of the Republican Party 's leading candidates for the Presidential nomina-t ion ; and a lean , trim , tanned young man , surprisingly like Andrew in his mannerisms , though not in his political beliefs , who has worked for the past ten years as a doctor in a world health clinic in India . She is not in mourning  --  escorted to receptions , to dinners , to a luncheon held high in the mountains , even to a lavish memorial service held one misty evening for a former ambassador to Greece who had died of a heart attack quite suddenly before the conference had even begun . She is not in mourning but chooses to wear the colors of mourning , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black skirt with a pale yellow silk blouse , a velvet suit , winy-dark , almost black , and a plain blue dress , long-sleeved , high-necked , that shows off her gaunt , earnest frame to advantage . The president of French , Wilton , &; Brinton is very attentive to her , and claims to have known Andrew during Andrew 's senatorial days ; the chairman of the board of the Hanley Aircraft Corporation is attentive to her , as is the industrial **30;1854;TOOLONG of Proxmire &; Aaron . She participates in several round-table discussions , apprehensive at first and then , gradually , as other people speak , increasingly confident , knowing that the voluminous notes she has brought with her contain insightsand facts and even clever ironies far superior to what is beingoffered  --  and Andrew 's ideas are received intelligently and respectfully , with only minimal questioning . The French Revolution and the " romance " of continual revolution and its close ties with decadence  --  the need for an empirical realism that incorporatesman 's idealism  --  his identification with the past , with tradition  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessity for  --  Who is going to question such a statement , who can get his mind around her ? As the discussion is breaking up , the tanned , pipe-smoking doctor asks Yvonne what the practicalconsequences of such a vision are , does she know , can they be predicted from such generalities or is it in the nature of such generalities that they are not to be burdened with the proof of history ?  --  what might such ideas lead to ? But no one is listening , the session is breaking up , Yvonne leans across the table to tell the man , her mouth shaped as if for a kiss , her voice low ,  |p336level  , in perfect control : " Assassination , of course . " He is shocked , shaken , visibly offended , he stares at her , sucking his pipe , says that was n't what he meant  --  she had misunderstood  --  but Yvonne pretends not to hear , being escorted to the door by a handsome gentleman with a faint British accent , who compliments her on the deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her if she would like to join him for cocktails at the Fairmont , since there is at least an hour and a half before the banquet in honor of .... She hears the news of the Pickard affair : the police and the State Troopers and the helicopter patrol and the tear gas and the hostage and the death of Pickard , riddled with bullets , and the outcry and public apologies by officials , all in a few hours ' time , and she is back in Albany , having returned earlier than she had planned , as if she had somehow made a mistake  --  imaginingAndrew was accompanying her , when in fact he was somehow , in some way , still back in the East . Sick to her stomach on the plane , she feels she is being punished ; she has been mourning her husband 's death after all , and that is the one thing she must not allow herself to do . After the Pickard incident there is a flurry of mail again . More mounted clippings , more holy cards , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ; the entire twenty-fourpageissue of a rather attractive magazine called Outrage , Inc. , published in Atlanta , Georgia , devoted to an article with the title : " The Murderers of the Honorable Andrew Petrie Continue to Move Among Us " by one Leander Rawlings ; astrological charts on both pulp and slick paper , with Andrew 's sign circled in red ; elaborate dream diagrams ; numbered steps leading to the moon whereby prophetic visions can be " interpreted by the layman " ; hexes for the widow 's employment , as well as anti-hex formulae ; mandalas , anagrams , riddles , quotations in Latin and Sanskrit , pages detached carefully from copies of I Ching with certain warningsunderscored ; drawings of witches , wizards , Christ , Indian holy men in full lotus position , the Infant of Prague in His splendor ; invitations to join various churches and church communities andp337communes , like the Disciples of Our Living Christ ; several copies of the same issue of The Meta-Realist , where November 's lead essay is " How the Fascists Are Using the Petrie Case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items like a stainless steel crucifix , a thimbleful of white grainy powder  --  heroin ?  --  arsenic ? - in a pink envelope with scalloped edges , a copy of The Consolationof Philosophy , published in 1870 in London and sent to her 1 oo an unknown admirer , mimeographed newsletters from youth n organizations , health food clubs , Hedonists Inc. , a variety of paperbackbooks : roof Spells : How To Cast Them , Remove Them , Counteract Them ; Conspirators Among Us ; A Handbook of Organic Gardening ; The True Astonishing Story of the J. F. Kennedy Assassination ; The Occult Powers : If They Are Not For You , They Are Against You ; Gods Among Us ? ; The Decline of The White Race and How to Combat It . In a special-delivery package there is another publication from Outrage , Inc. , published in 1969 , a book that deals in extraordinary detail with the SinoJewishconspiracy , which dates back to the year zoo B.C. and involvesfor some reason both Egyptian and German royalty ; several American Presidents are related by blood to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family tree are marked by actual photographs , much reduced in size . For Mrs. Andrew Petrie , with the compliments of the author , Dabney Reynolds III . There are innumerable letters , some typewritten , some hand-printed , some scrawled in ballpoint ink ; one , arriving in an envelope without a stamp , is apparently from someone in the apartment building . It asks the widow Are you satisfied now that you have stolen a decent woman 's husband and brought shame to an illustrious family ? " Do n't these things upset you ? " Charles Bausch asked one day . lle had come to talk with Yvonne about certain joint capital ventures he and Andrew had been seriously considering before the murder ; he wandered into the sitting room and was struck by the piles of mail . " Why should they upset me , " Yvonne said coldly . " They mean nothing to me . They have nothing to do with me . " " But all these people  --  ! Just the fact that they exist , that they are evidently thinking of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thighs nervously . He was a plump , well-dressed man in his early fifties , with very light , sweet bluep338eyes . His face was flushed , his manner more troubled than usual . " They 're not thinking of me , " Yvonne said . " Not of me . They do n't know me at all . " " All the same , if I received things like these , or if Pamela did ... . It would be very disturbing , I think . " " It does n't disturb me , " Yvonne said . She was not lying . " I feel nothing at all when I open them . I just open them ... I see what they are ... I do n't even laugh any longer , as Andrew and I once did , and I certainly do n't feel any alarm . I do n't feel anything at all , " she said . " Then you 're very fortunate , " Charles said neutrally . He picked up one of the copies of The Meta-Realist and leafed through it . It was tabloid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each page accompanying the smudged columns of print . " They hate us , " Charles whispered . " It 's as Andrew knew , as he always warned ... they hate us , they want to destroy us . The conspiracy is coming out into the open , in mongrel publications like this , but there must be some trick ! The editors are listed , the place of publication is listed . It must be to mislead us ! The real conspirators are elsewhere , do n't you think , underground , supremelysophisticated , funded by China and Cuba and . .. . These people are sick , " he said , tossing the newspaper down . " At the very least , Yvonne , " he said irritably , " you should have a secretary handle this . Andrew 's methods were perfectly  --  " " I told you it does n't bother me , " Yvonne said . " I do n't need a secretary . I do n't want a secretary . I can handle this  --  I do n't answer most of it , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I simply look at it and keep it around for a while and then throw it out . I can handle it , I can handle anything . And as I told you , it does n't upset me ; it does n't upset me in the least . " " Yes , you 're very fortunate , " Charles said slowly . The sofas , couches , chairs , cushions , pillows , and carpets have been cleaned . There is a slight chemical smell ; there is a persistentdampness to the air . Everything is sharper , each fabric bright , aggressively clean , not quite the color Yvonne believed it to be . The green velvet love seat is a peculiar electric lime green now , bewilderingly bright when the sun catches it . The carpet throbs with strength ; its once subtle colors now undulate beneath Yvonne 's feet . Everything looks renewed , invigorated , harshlyp339clean and dramatic . The effect is a powerful one , Yvonne thinks , and perhaps it is worth the cost . However , there are smudges on the newly painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scuff and scratch marks on the hardwoodfloors , especially in the entryway between the living room and dining room . The smallest bathroom , the guest bathroom , has been cruelly used  --  men 's fingerprints everywhere , the small scatter rugs dirty , the toilet seat itself dirty . The fabrics gleam with a cruel , hard , bright health , but the walls look nearly as gray as they did previously . The widow thinks : His things are being desecrated . She thinks , walking from room to room : I ca n't stop what is happening . She signs the check and Fritz Sanderson takes it from her . " I 'll put this into a neutral account , " he says , " and make sure the Pickard family gets it . From an anonymous donor ? " " An anonymous donor , " the widow says tonelessly . Time passes , the mail slackens again , drops to no more than live or six items a day except for Mondays , when a package arrives from the offices of Discourses . She continues to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contents aside into small piles . She is unmoved . She reads some of the letters more than once  --  the insultingletters , the obscene letters , the letters that accuse Andrew of ugly crimes or Yvonne of crimes , even of her husband 's murder  --  she reads them , pauses over them , as if waiting to feel some emotion . Nothing . She is unmoved . She is on the veranda of the old farmhouse on Fremont Road . He is working in the garden , which is a mess of weeds and briars and rosebushes gone wild . Yvonne ? Yvonne , where are you ? She stands on the veranda , not hiding , not shrinking back against the side of the house ; yet he can not see her . His fair silvery-blond hair gleams in the pale sunshine , his smile is visible , appealing . Yvonne ?  |p340He  has been working too hard . It is too difficult , the effort of bringing together so many years ' work . He can not always read his own handwriting . Some of the pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not adequately developed  --  they are scribbles  --  jottings  --  agile astonishing leaps of logic  --  not translatable into prose . He is digging in the garden now , giving his mind a rest , wearing a pair of gardening gloves he found in the workshed , galoshes over his shoes . He looks strong , robust , but it might be a trick of the light . He is tired , he is too tired to sleep at night . Yvonne ? he calls petulantly . He has been working too hard for months , for years . For a lifetime . There are lines of bitterness radiating out from his eyes and mouth . Yvonne ? You wo n't leave me ? Yvonne ? In the background is the sound of the river , the gushing rapids . The river is shallow at this point , the rapids are splashing , churning , foaming white . But the river is some distance away . The river is hidden . It breaks over rocks , splashes and flies into the air , turns to foam , to spray , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heavy throbbing in the head . He throws down the hoe . He approaches her , squinting . Is he blind ? Is he pretending to be blind ? He limps , he must be unusually tired , she knows she must hurry to him  --  she must run to him , her arms outstretched . Otherwise it may be too late . But he is smaller than she remembers .... Smaller , and yet cocky , self-assured . He wears old clothes that are too large for him . The knees of his overalls are filthy . Yet he is smiling , squinting in her direction , he has sighted her , has sensed her . Yvonne ? She will go to him , there is no question about that . She does not care so much for  --  for whatever it is that holds her back ; she does not care so much for her own self , Yvonne Radek , Yvonne the tall , gawky , sullen , coarsehairedcreature , Yvonne the ugly one , Yvonne with the long narrow hands and feet . In the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And set up a shriek , the bitches . The scrubbing with a wire brush , the stench and shock of kerosene , afterward the humiliation , the jeers ! No , she does not care so much for Yvonne . In fact , she rather despises Yvonne . And so she will go to him . Yvonne ? he is calling . But he has shrunk , and his face is so fleshy-pink ! She sees thatp341it is an artificial face . Ah , she thinks , they did fix it , inside the coffin . But not well enough . A face of liverish pink , putty and paint and darkened eyebrows , the mouth moist and rosy as if wet with life , fixed in that demanding smile . Behind him is the vegetation she hated  --  the summer before his death it went out of control and she hated it  --  hated it . The farm had no memories for her . It was his family , his life . She hated it . Now he limps toward her , he has thrown the hoe down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tier , pleading , begging , a whine of fear in his voice . She steps into view . She will not hide from him . But my God ! His face ! He did not want to die , he did not want his handsome face so cruelly smashed . He limps toward her and she hesitates only a moment and then steps off the veranda and hurries toward him , to help him , to catch him before he falls ... . Yvonne ? he cries , not seeing her . Yvonne , are you here ? When the doorbell rang she was reading the preface to the second edition of The Critique of Pure Reason in Andrew 's old broken-backed Modern Library edition , with its close-packed type and narrow margins and thin paper ; she was reading with completeabsorption  --  must have been sitting here for a very long time , in a kind of trance  --  and taking notes on the countless tiny comments Andrew had made in the book . Nearly every page was annotated . There were some pages , throughout the Critique , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Yvonne intended to read them . The tic doorbell rang again and she went to answer it , indifferently , not pausing to wonder what she looked like  --  it was eleven in the morning and she was not yet really dressed  --  and it was only the manager of the apartment building , whose name she continually forgot ; it crossed her mind that perhaps she should not have opened the door so readily without inquiring about who had rung . It was not impossible that someone could slip by the doorman or bribe one of the building maintenance men to let him in ....  | " Yes , " she said , interrupting , " I did receive Mr. Wheaton 's letter and it was very kind of him and skillfully written , but I do n't intend to move out  --  that 's why I did n't reply to the letter . " " We have only been thinking of  --  " " Do you have a petition ? Do you have signatures ? " Yvonne said mildly . " If the other tenants are worried about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some kind  --  you can break their leases for them , you can let them move into other buildings of Mr. Wheaton 's . " " Mrs. Petrie , I wonder if I could come in for a moment ? " " I have n't any time for you , " Yvonne said . " I 'm working . " " The offer of  --  Mr. Wheaton had only in mind  --  You see , it 's a matter of  --  of the other tenants , yes  --  a sizable number of them , in fact  --  as you know , some of the apartments are rented by women who live alone , quite elderly women  --  widows  --  and they 're very concerned , and their children are very concerned  --  for instance Gabriel Hendon 's mother lives just two floors below and  --  " " Who is Gabriel Hendon ? " Yvonne said . " I do n't know Gabriel Hendon . " " Of course you know Gabriel Hendon ! " the man said miserably . "  --  and so  --  we thought that possibly  --  Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pay all expenses , and he does own what he personally considers to be a far more interesting building than this where you might rent or buy a condominium at your leisure and where  --  " " I do n't know Gabriel Hendon , " Yvonne said . " Andrew never mentioned him . He did n't associate with speculators and he certainlywould not move out of this building until he was ready to move . " " Mrs. Petrie , you put us in a very , very awkward position , " the man said . " There is a petition , yes , and we were terribly upset when it was presented to us-we tried to reason with them , we tried to point out that the Tower is totally impregnable  --  we have more security guards , I believe , than we actually need  --  as well as TV surveillance at all the possible points of entry and in the elevators - and Mr. Ryan at the door knows absolutely everyone who lives here and would not let even a close relative come upstairs without buzzing first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But it is n't my problem , " Yvonne said . " I do n't know whyp343you 're telling me this . Since I have a three-year lease , and since I do n't intend to move , why are you telling me these things and taking up so much time ?  --  Your other tenants have the problem , not me . " " It 's my problem , " he said hurriedly . She looked at him for the first time . Astonishing !  --  a gentle , aging man no more than five feet two or three , rimless glasses , a very wrinkled throat , staring t her with such terror . Yvonne looked at him . He was speaking ; chain , his lips were actually trembling . For a moment she felt pity  --  she felt quite moved. "  --  two of the ladies were down talking to me this morning so very very upset and I tried so hard to reason with them but what can I do or say ?  --  one of them is almost totally deaf , Mrs. Petrie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sorts of strange noises and voices and that sort of thing  --  she 's so very very certain about it and since she is one of our oldest tenants ; Ind has been with us since the first week the Tower opened  --  and since as I said there are others  --  not all of them elderly , eitherwconly thought that perhaps that possibly  --  if you would be so kind as to consider the situation  --  and they say you have many visitors ?  --  though Mr. Ryan claims you do not and he should know  --  they swear you have many male visitors and that something is definitely going on  --  a party or a meeting or something  --  and though I have tried to explain to them that  --  " " Who are these people ? " Yvonne said . " I want to see the peti-tion .

" I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Mr. Petrie himself would have been sympathetic with these poor frightened women , I think , " the man said hesitantly .

It seems to me that in memory of him , in a sense , you might  --  " " Who are those people ? Who began the petition ?

He 's told me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would feel so much more comfortable if I could come in , " the man said , lowering his voice , " or maybe you would consent to come downstairs to my office ? If you  --  after you  --  I mean , of course , after you were  --  perhaps on your way out of the building  --  " She still pitied him , she did not want to look at him . These weak , frightened people ! Andrew 's housekeeper had been the same way , a Slavic woman of indeterminate age , no longer young , and Yvonne had found it painful even to talk with her about casual things  --  impossible to give the woman instructions about the apartment . Her heart turned , she felt not only pity but a flash of shame , guilt , revulsion for herself and for such people , who stared at her , at the outside of her , with such trepidation ! And it was shameful , too , she knew very well how disgusting it was , that she should manipulate and employ and appear to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Mrs. Petrie , " he pleaded , " I wish there were some way that everyone could be satisfied and things return back to normal and  --  " Yvonne stepped back , away from him . She was tired of this conversation suddenly . She was tired . What did she care for him , for his terror ? Why had she cared so much about the housekeeper , when the woman had clearly despised her ? She was tired of wastingher time with such people , she wanted only to return to Andrew'sstudy , to his desk , to the only valuable part of her life . " Everyone satisfied ! Things return to normal ! " she said , mimickinkhim . " Things will never return to normal  --  go tell them that . Things will never , never return to normal , " she said slowly .

For a moment she feels nothing , the lower part of her body is numb , and then it begins , as if from a distance , the slight dull ache of cramps , only that , nothing more . Earlier , in the bathtub , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very faint  --  had imagined she 'd seen them in the bath water  --  but her mind drifted onto other things , she took no more notice , she forgot . It is only her blood , only that , the most trivial and negligible sort of blood ; though she has not had anything like a full , normal period since sometime in June , this still means very little to her  --  she could not have been pregnant , after all  --  she cares very little about these things . Remote , trivial , a harassing ache in her loins  --  she cares very little , she has forgotten even to be concerned . " Nothing will be the same again . Nothing will be normal again . " " I do n't know what you mean , " Yvonne said uneasily . " It ca n't  --  it ca n't return to what it was . You know what I mean . " " I do n't exactly .... " " It is n't just that I have no one to talk to , it is n't just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now it 's you too . You know what I mean . " " Please , I really .... " " You know what I mean , " Eliot said . She read that the will of the sovereign must be carried out , whoever the sovereign is . It can make no difference who it is . Whyp346would it make a difference , what difference could it make ?  --  there are no differences above or below . Her eyes ached , she remembered the poor , frightened man in the dream  --  his glazed-over eyes  --  the artificial heartiness of his face . Whenever she stirred she felt how steadily the blood flowed , a fine feathery-thin stream ; the rest of the time she forgot . She did not think of it . She read that even genius has a place in the cruel , tyrannical order of the sovereign : to celebrate , to praise . " You know what I mean , " Eliot said over the telephone . After a while he stopped calling . She went to the Elmer F. Clay Foundation banquet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband . For Outstanding Lifelong Citizenship in the United States of America . She wore a dark velvet dress , several strands of pearls , porous fresh-pink paint on her mouth . Her manner was subdued . During the long dinner she tried to let her mind drift , back to the apartment or at least out of the hotel banquet room ; but she kept hearing the conversations around her and because she was alone , without Andrew , she suddenly felt the danger of an exterior world crammed to bursting with people she could not tolerate . If he were with her , they would glance at each other from time to time , accidentally , unconsciously . They would happen to look up at the same moment ; they would face each other across the length of a table , suddenly amused , wanting to laugh aloud . But she was alone , even when people talked to her she was alone , her numbed lips responding , her manner brightly dark for the occasion , a pretense of warmth , something harmlessly womanlike , womanly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" An attractive blond man in his late thirties made the presentationspeech . He was evidently a professor of history at a local institution . He glanced at Yvonne and then out at his audience , back to Yvonne again , and back to his audience , dramatically . He was a superb speaker .

" Yvonne looked at the people , mainly men , who were looking at her . It was a curious moment : she was in perfect control , she was smiling the sort of small , sad smile the occasion demanded , yet none of it was real . She half-believed she would wake and find herself at Andrew 's desk . The banquet room was overheated and smoky , but even these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband ? Where  --  ? She glanced from table to table , from face to face . She was still smiling . So many men , so many faces !  --  but all strangers . It occurred to her that the world was composed of strangers . They stared at her , they did not know her , did not love her or value her . " I want to thank you for  --  for  --  " A man rose suddenly from a seat almost directly in front of her . He took several steps forward , shouting , and before Yvonne could even step back he dashed a glass of warm water at her  --  it splashed into her face , onto her shoulders and chest . She was astonished . She watched as two men grappled with him , subdued him , dragged him into the aisle .

She was certain of that . He had jumped up from his seat , a man with no identity , no face she could recall , he had jumped up and shouted at her , had called her A whore , had dashed water into her face  --  all so quickly , no one had known what was happening . She had not known . She still did not know .  --  So quickly ! It had happened so quickly ! The medallion froth the Foundation was very heavy . It was nearly a foot in diameter , coinlike , with an elderly man 's profile on it , in copper . Elmer F. Clay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closet , beneath some linens . It was heavy : lifting it , she felt the warm seepage of blood in her loins , again . But she was not in pain . She felt pleasantly numb . When Andrew 's younger brother Stephen was introduced to Yvonne , he shook hands rather stiffly with her  --  he stared almost as if he believed he knew her , had recognized her . But she did not know him ; they had never met before . Andrew let his hand fall on Stephen 's shoulder fondly . He was two or three inches shorter than Stephen but he appeared taller , more powerful ; in the awkward silence that immediately followed I be introduction , he guided them skillfully , smiling , patting his brother 's shoulder as if they were friends . His manner was genial , even sunny . " All of my family are rather unusual , rather uniquely individual , " he said , still patting Stephen 's shoulder , still presentinghim to Yvonne . " But Stephen is my favorite ; Stephen and I , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his quick , clipped , daylight manner  --  his surface charm , so adroit in society , so really indefinable when Yvonne tried to analyze it afterward . Andrew could talk directly to individuals and yet retain that elusive , intimidating air of being distant , as if he were onstage , protected from his audience by distance and elevationand powerful glaring lights that both illuminated him andp350blinded him to his viewers .  --  Yet in the next moment he might change , might become suddenly personal , even intimate . His expressionshifted subtly ; the gaze narrowed , became intense ; the hand on the shoulder gripped . " But we wo n't meet , will we , " he said to Stephen , " in front of my bride ... ? The last thing poor Yvonne wants is to become embroiled in family disputes . " Stephen did not smile . He drew away from Andrew . " Why do you think I came here just to fight , " he said in a warm , mild voice , not looking at either Andrew or Yvonne , blushing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk with you . " " Yes , " Andrew sighed , smiling , " and I can guess about what . " They talked for several hours . From time to time Yvonne could hear her husband 's voice raised  --  and then silence ; and then both voices again , indistinguishable . It alarmed and excited her when Andrew was angry ; in a way it pleased her . He was so rarely angry , always aloof and in control and subtly amused by his opponents  --  and then , the effect of his passion , his genuine emotion ! Her senses were stirred by his emotions as they would never have been by those of a lesser man . Midsummer . July . An unmarked day . Opalescent sky , great slabs of dusty cloud , like concrete . A forty-mile-an-hour wind from the mountains that morning . But near noon the sun appears , the wind dies down , the clouds are broken . No storm , not even the threat of a storm ; now there is sunshine , a sudden transformation of the mountains and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is working on , climbs the stairs to the attic and then the several steps into the cupola at the very top of the old house . It is smaller than she expects . No more than ten by fifteen feet . Used for storage , jammed with old books and magazines and several large trunks , everything damp , ill-smelling , dirty . There are birddroppingseverywhere . Dust . Cobwebs . A solitary wasp flies toward her ; when she waves it aside , it flies away mechanically , leaves the cupola by a broken window . She looks out  --  sparrows are chattering a few yards away , on the rotted shingles of the main roof . She shades her eyes , looks out . From this height she can see the highway that leads to Fremont and to Gloversville ; she can even see the small , unpaved road that follows the river fork . The riverp351itself is intermittently visible , obscured by foliage , mainly willow trees growing tight along its banks . She stares at the mountains , not recognizing them . Which one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not very interested . They are at the farm for a week , alone . Yvonne has never been here before . She is still a bride  --  offers herself , still , in the guise of a bride  --  asking questions , curious to know , to learn , to adapt . Her adaptation to this marriage has proven far less difficult than she had anticipated . She is disappointed , however , with the condition of the farm . The house , built in the late eighteenth century , has been badly neglected : the roof leaks , there is an odor of rot and mildew everywhere , the plumbing is antiquated  --  has not been improved , Andrew said , since the thirties . But he likes it here , he likes the solitude here , the privacy . No neighbors , no telephone . Less than a hundred miles from Albany , but totally isolated , inaccessible to intrusion . He can think here , he says . He can breathe here . Yvonne is his bride of eight months and she is surprised by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are memories here that exclude her , a past that excludes her ; here he keeps to himself even more than he does at the apartment . She is disappointed in the farm , having expected something more impressive . The house is large enough , enormous , with a wide fieldstone front and steep roofs , because of the heavy snows , and many rooms  --  most of them closed off , so she and Andrew are living in four rooms downstairs . It has little about it that is decorative or ornamental , like other houses of that period : no pillars , no columns , no wood trim . Very functional , plain . More a farmhouse than a country mansion . It is bordered by a stone wall , the front and side yards were used not long ago as cow pastures , and its clayey quarter-mile lane to the highway is bordered by shortleaf pine never trimmed , but allowed to grow free . From Fremont Road the house is hardly visible . When she first saw it she said How beautiful , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrew accept it ; he merely said that she should wait till they got closer . In its way it was beautiful , with so many windows  --  countless windows  --  and the flagstone front and the cupola , peeling white , archaic and fragile and otherworldly , a little comic . The cupola was almost entirely windows and seemed to float above the pines andp352oaks as if it were not attached to the broad , squat house . Wings had been added crudely to either end of the house , ordinary brick later painted white . The main barn had a solid stone foundation ; there were two smaller barns , a stable , a springhouse , even a smokehouse . Thousands of acres of land , most of it wooded . Beautiful , she thought , with an inexplicable resentment . " This would be a very valuable property , " Yvonne said . " A house built in 1749 .... Why have you people let it go like this ? " " There is n't any people , there 's just me , " Andrew said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  they 've more or less forgottenit . They have other things to care about , as you know . " He spoke as if amused , but brusquely , as he always did when she inquired about something insignificant . Or perhaps he did not believe it was any of her concern . " I like it this way , " Andrew said . " I wo n't fix it up until it starts to cave in . " " Yes , " Yvonne said . " It 's a place to take sanctuary in , if you know what I mean ; there 's no sense of time here , all the times are jumbled , the nineteen-seventies and the seventeen-seventies , adulthood , childhood  --  myfather used to come out here occasionally , used to bring us out for little vacations  --  I do n't mind things being dilapidated , I like the way the barn roof is falling in and the ivy is taking over , and the moss ; I like the squirrels in the upstairs rooms and the owls and the insects and the damage from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's like nature : it 's here , it exists in its own dimension , and essentially there is something pointless about it , so no one will fight over it . " " Yes , I see , " Yvonne said . Yes , I see , she mimics her voice . She stands in the cupola , leaningout one of the broken windows , restless , ironic , yet rather subdued . Is she in disguise , is it a masquerade ? Or is it , on the contrary , working out far more remarkably than either of them had hoped ? Not love , not that kind of love ; both are tired of that kind of love ; both are faintly contemptuous of it and never speak of it and never think of it , in fact . How beautiful . Yes , I see . The bride , a young woman in khaki trousers and a black blouse , stands at the broken window , squinting into the sun . About the beauty of the trees and the mountains and the stark blue sky there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will not speak of it and consequently will not think of it and , vaguely , she resents it forp353mposing such muteness upon her ; she is very verbal , quick-minded , aware of herself as a performer . If she is a performer , however , she is not necessarily insincere . Sincerity too demands a performance , a face . " I low beautiful , " she says aloud , testing the words . " Beautiful . Beautiful . " lost of the mountains are dark with timber . Mt . Invemere and itnval Mountain and another , to the west , have peaks that extend sliglitly beyond the timberline ; but even these are small mountains , hardly more than hills , compared to the Rockies . She does not think of the Rockies , does not remember them clearly . If she has a visual memory of them it is probably based on a photograph ; she has no real , emotional memory of them at all . Blank . Null . Dead . Here the mountains are small but comely . She must interpretthem as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three sides , at a distance . Everything is comely , a picture , a backdrop for their work , his work , and as he said  --  it is irrelevant , it is essentially pointless . The beauty of nature , the muteness of nature : pointless . Foxes and porcupine and raccoons and muskrats Ind rabbits and deer and pheasants and partridges and hawks and : Iys and sapsuckers and smaller birds of all kinds ... ashes and beeches and pines and elms and oaks ... marvelous , mindless ; yet invisible , in a sense , when the human intellect leaps into play and demands its own kind , its own kind in combat . She sees a movement in the lane . She shades her eyes  --  sees nothing  --  waits  --  then sees the figure of a man , approaching the house from the highway . She had not seen him a moment earlier . It is a shock to see him , so suddenly , as if he has come out of nowhere ... . But she should not be surprised ; Andrew had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from West Virginia . The Manitou was a spirit that used to live in the mountains , in the wildest parts of the mountains . It could take the form of a bear , a panther , or a deer , in order to lead the Indian to his death . This spirit had no other reason for its existence , evidently , exceptp354to wreak evil upon men . . . . The Indian might come to his senses at the very edge of a precipice , or as he was about to slip into the water and drown . . . then he would realize that the creature he 'd been chasing was n't a living animal , but a spirit . At the last momentthe Manitou turned to him and shrieked in triumph , because it could never resist identifying itself , it wanted that peculiar kind of triumph . . . . Some hunters returned to tell about the Manitou , but most of them never returned , of course . They died . They were found dead in the mountains . Andrew at someone 's house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She can not remember the setting now  --  can not remember who was with them . But a woman did ask , brightly , whether the Manitou was still in the mountains ?  --  whether it was still dangerous there ? Absolutely not , Andrew said . The Indians are gone from the mountains and with the Indians are gone their devils ; we Iive here now . She was talking about the fiasco of the previous day  --  the Republicansin the Senate having overestimated their voting strength on a certain controversial issue , and the majority leader , whom she had always thought a fool , forced to reverse his course in public  --  to the scornful delight of the opposition ; she was talking animatedly , grinning her wide insouciant affected grin , unaware of the shoppers who were forced to go around her and Yvonne . They were on the street floor of Kildare 's , not far from the front entrance , in the busiest part of the store ; but Pamela talked and talked , oblivious of the irritated stares she was drawing , not noticing Yvonne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it was close to alarm . How Pamela had changed ! How sick she looked , despite the skillfully applied makeup , the brave wide smile ! Yvonne was so startled at the sight of her , so dismayed and bewildered , that she found it difficult to follow Pamela 's words . ' What was she saying , what was the point she hoped to make , why did she keep taking Yvonne 's gloved hand , tugging gently atp355her ... ? Mink hat , mink coat , fashionably at midcalf , and youthfulsuede boots to the knee ; her dyed hair flounced out from under the fur hat , ends turned up perfectly , as always ; the wide lower lip , the artfully thin upper lip , carefully outlined in a dusky pink tone ; the eyes sparkling desperately , as if this were a dinner party or a flirtation , inside their complex structure of black paint , silver-blue eye shadow , and wrinkles caked with makeup . She had aged incredibly since Yvonne had seen her last , at Andrew 's funeral . How was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did Yvonne like the weather so far ?  --  already so much snow ! How was Hugh ? Had Yvonne seen Hugh recently ? How was Doris ? Pamela had not seen Doris for some time . And Stephen ? Did she ever hear from him ? Or of him ? Did she remember that dinner party early last spring at the Greasons ' , when they 'd all had such a good time ? I lad she seen Adrienne or Leon recently ? What was she doing with herself ?  --  someone said she was editing Andrew 's paper  --  letters ?  --  had gone to an international conference to present one of Andrew 's speeches  --  ? Yvonne managed to draw her off to the side , out of the center aisle . She had always avoided Pamela Bausch  --  had instinctively feared her  --  admired her , in a way , for her relentless brassy manner , which disguised an exceptional shrewdness ; but she had avoided her , knowing that Pamela was a personal enemy . Greeting Andrew once , the woman had thrown her arms around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was her favorite cousin  --  pressing herself against him in a bizarre way , as if parodying a seductive embrace  --  squinchingup her face , rolling her eyes  --  then stepping back to hold him at arm 's length , as if to prevent him from crushing her against him . Such forced , feverish gaiety , such a girlishreliance upon her charm ... and the pretense of being drunker than she was . Yvonne had been angry , though she had not shown it . Andrew liked Pamela , always made excuses for her , alluding vaguely to her numerous difficult marriages and disastrous love affairs ; it was clear that he liked her very much . And she was clownish , amusing : after embracing Andrew that time , she had jumped back and then , a moment later , held out his wallet to him  --  a new trick she 'd learned , she told them all , snorting with laughterherself . They were astonished , they applauded her , they seemed unable to resist the woman 's manic high spirits.  |p356Pamela  was looking searchingly at Yvonne . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then returned to her subject  --  chattering about the family , about the vacation in the Caribbean she and Charles hoped to take in another two weeks  --  all the while holding Yvonne 's wrist . Yvonne wondered if she had been drinking . " I suppose people talk about me too , " Pamela said , " I suppose they ca n't resist talking about us all . . . it 's our fate , is n't it ... and nothing changes , nothing seems to be happening ... what will we do , Yvonne , if they are n't caught ? They must be caught ! They must be punished ! Andrew was your husband and I was only a cousin of his , a second cousin , we were n't close in the same way , but ... but we were very , very good friends ... I valued him so highly though maybe I did n't always show it . . . I 'm such a scatterbrain , I always have been . May I ask you something very personal , Yvonne ?  --  or would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yvonne said uneasily . But something in Yvonne 's expression discouraged Pamela ; she grinned , patted her stiff hair nervously , changed the subject . " I wish we had been closer , Yvonne , before it happened ... I could have comforted you , I 'm sure I would have been useful ... you must have needed someone and there was no one , was there , no one you trusted ... and I do n't blame you . I do n't blame you . It has been such a strain on you , it shows in your face , it always shows in the face . .. of course you 're still a beautiful woman , a very beautiful ... beautiful woman . And you 're still relatively young . We never did talk , did we ? I kept wanting to have you to the house for lunch , just the two of us ; but I 'm always so busy , and you were always so busy , and Andrew might have disapproved ... since he did n't always approve , you know , of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . in terms of investments , I mean ... before I met Charles ... and then , after I met Charles , I believe it was Andrew who encouraged me to marry him . . . as a kind of investment , you might say , " she laughed . Her eyes were bright , merry . Yet there was a queer leaden cast to her face , her skin tone ; whenever she was silent , whenever she allowed her smile to sag , she looked suddenly spiritless . " I wanted to ask you , Yvonne , if . . . . It 's so strange , it 's terrifying , but .... I was wondering .... " She stared at Yvonne , utterly blank . Yvonne shivered.  | " Yes ... ? " After a moment she shook her head mutely . Then she laughed , went on to speak of the necessity of exercise , of a change of scene regularly , less hectic a social life , and a diet high in protein . " My health is n't as good as it might appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's mainly because of poor eating and sleeping habits I acquiredas a teen-ager . We lived in Washington part of the time , you know ... or maybe you do n't know . I doubt that Andrew wasted much breath talking about me to you . Yes , my father worked in Washington , had a very demanding but thankless job . I wish I had had the leisure to have grown up here in Albany , with the others ... it might have done me a great deal of good , a steadying influence , you know ... because Washington is frantic , incredible . I loved it , do n't let me mislead you ! I loved it . I still would , if Charles allowed me more freedom , but ... but things there are changed . .. always new people , new people . .. and the others , well of course the others grow older or change in different ways . . . or die . Growing up in that city was very exciting , Yvonne , but I think I lost my childhood or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the way , " she laughed . " I 'm supposed to be indestructible , people tell me . Men . They can sense something about me , like dogs sniffing .... Is it the same way with you ? You and men ? Or do n't you ... ? By now I 'm sure I would be remarried , Yvonne , I simply could n't have endured ! . . . and living in that apartment , that apartment , alone ! ... always thinking of him , always being reminded .... I 'm sure I would have remarried by now , practically anyone , " Pamela said , trying to make a joke of it . " Even that ... that lackey , that what's-his-name , the editor of Discourses . .. or is he already married ? Someone was saying .... But .... There are always rumors , I do n't credit them with much reality ... especially after my history ... the outlandish lies told about me . If you 've heard any of them , Yvonne , I hope you disregardedthem . I would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to stand in the way of ... of a friendship .... People have told cruel lies about both of us , you know ; but what can you do ? They all lie , they all gossip ! It would have been even worse , you know , if Andrew had been in office . That was the wisest move he ever made , retiring from politics ... he was too good for those bastards , was n't he ? ... I do n't care what anyonesays . He was too good , too honest . It was almost neurotic ,  |p358that  man 's honesty ! ... but wonderful , wonderful . There are no other men like him . Willa Fergus was n't good enough for him , she simply was n't intelligent enough and he needed someone to talk to , did n't he , that was the main thing in his life , he needed someone who would understand ... and he was so brilliant , so intellectual , I always gave up , could n't follow him , agreed with anything he said . The thing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much , " she said , her eyes glistening , " he cared so much about the world , that was why he was so angry all the time and could n't relax and the trouble with his stomach , well that was obvious , I mean it was obvious he was in pain at times .. . he cared too much , he had too much invested in the world , I knew about the ulcers and was so very , very sorry for him and for you both ... the ulcers , the operations .... " Yvonne wanted to interrupt . What was this ! The woman was drunk or drugged , talking like this ! Passersby were glancing at them , at both of them . Yvonne had the idea that they were recognized . " Other men do n't give a damn about the world , " Pamela whispered . " They want to make money , that 's it . They do n't give a damn  --  they do n't know the world is there  --  my father had an important position in Washington but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a public or a world or .. . or whatever I mean . You have to care about the world to get so angry , do n't you . " Yes , " Yvonne said . " But Pamela , really  --  " " Do n't leave ! Do n't tell me you have to leave ! " Pamela protested . " I 've been meaning to call you for months ! ... and when I saw Hugh recently , I made up my mind ... I was definitely going to call you ... ' but ... at the last minute I always hesitated ... I always .... Because I had the idea you did n't care for me , you know ; you disliked me . . . ? " " Of course not , " Yvonne said , embarrassed . " I can sense even the most subtle of feelings , " Pamela said wistfully . " And I thought . . . I always thought .... " " Of course not , " Yvonne said . " That 's ridiculous . " " ... in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a sister ? " Pamela radiated an odor that was spicy , tawny , tangy ... not quite clean ; her breath smelled of something liquorish and fruity.  |p359Yvonne  laughed nervously , looking away . Kildare 's was a wintry festival , a wonderland of synthetic glittering frost and icicles that turned , twinkling , and clouds of angels ' - hair and baurite ; above the lavish cosmetics section a gigantic whitely clad Santa Claus plunged with his reindeer and heavily-laden sleigh , stardust glitteringin his silky white beard and in his bushy white eyebrows and even in his protruding staring eyes  --  the reindeers ' eyes were jewels , light bulbs , their antlers were sprayed with frost , their hides stark white , a smooth satiny down : an Arctic paradise , this well-heated store .... Yvonne hardly knew where she was . She hardly knew what season it was , what might be expected of her . Christmas bulbs twinkled and gleamed from every corner of the ceiling , as if making signals to her ; the reindeers ' eyes glowed and darkened , and glowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whipped cream floated without weight , the giant Santa Claus presided , plump and sleekly white , grinning , the whip forever suspended above the beasts ' backs , never the release of its angry snap , never the release of its pain . . . only the shoppers , millingin the aisles , most of them dressed like Pamela Bausch , seemed to Yvonne recognizable if not entirely convincing . A fragment of an epic passed close behind her , and then away ; she overheard If a heart could break that was what happened to that poor man ... no one could have foreseen . . . he hesitated for years and then sold the property for a million ... in Boca Raton I mean ... and the new owners sold it for twice that a year Iater , I 'm not exaggerating , now he 's lost all will to live and we 're hoping this Christmas , with the grandchildren ... .

" What a thing to say , " Yvonne murmured . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't drunk and she is n't sick and she is n't having a breakdown , " Yvonne said carefully , since Pamela 's husband Charles had sounded so annoyed , " but I think you might want to come get her .... Yes ? Good . " Pamela was sprawled on the long leather sofa by the fireplace , her coat on the floor beside her , the hat stuck impishly atop one of Andrew 's antique clocks . She had already finished her drink . Her face was puffy , lined , yet her eyes were curiously bright  --  as if she were a mischievous little girl , temporarily resting . " Is he coming to get me ? Why did you call him ? ... **27;1886;TOOLONG in hopes I would cancel my outing to Richmond . There are also however , as you 're old enough to know , a few dark spots that have never bleached out  --  the simple fact that your birth tried to kill me ; and though I fought for and won new life , I still and will always suffer that damage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is also the fact of your father in you . But no , I repeat I have honored you , liked you , and taken much pleasure from the years you were here . If I spent less time on your daily care than some mothers would have , you need to recall that I had prior claims  --  Father 's sadness and need , the pain I had caused him  --  and that there was ample care at hand , your aunt , Mag , Sylvie , a whole loving house of which you were one of the actual centers . To say you were not loved here , and by me among the others , is only to say you have small notion of what love is or entails and exacts . Never say it again . That I held you back from your father and his people . I did ; I agree . For these two reasons  --  first , I thought I had harmed you enough in advance by bringing you into the life I could offer , without splitting you into further pieces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor at trouble ; we generally run . So were the Watsons , my mother 's people , and so  --  to my certain knowledge  --  were the May fields , all except Hattie your father 's sister . Why would I flag you onward then into trouble I knew you would surely not face but flee and thus deepen ? Second , your father has not asked for you since Christmas of 1904 . Not a word nor a cent . That I kept you in ignorance of half your family . Again I did  --  and again I did it out of what I intended as kindness to us both . I never knew the past to be of help to anybody . Far from it . I have seen it ruin my own mother and paralyze your father as surely as a stroke , though young and strong and with much to lose  --  namely you and me . My aim is generally to live for the day , or the day after ; but all around me I have always had , and felt smothered by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Please do n't you , which brings me to the most hurtful question of all  --  that I want your care , demand your presence as a means of protection for my own future life . I honestly do not . Again two reasons  --  I am permanently cared for ( you well know ) by Father ; he has seen to that and explained all the business to Kennerly and me . When he goes there will be no trouble at least ; not riches but life as always , I guess . Even if he had n't though and I were alone , I am sure I could live . I am strong enough to work . I could teach school , nurse , sew for people , paint flowers , bake , scrub if need be , pick cotton , hoe corn . What pride I possess is not the lady kind . I know ways to fight , and some ways to win . You are witness to that , one of the chief . Those are the answers which , again , I obviously think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and full , because you asked so seriously . You willp151use them your way but  --  however , wherever , need it or not  --  always with my love . My love then , MotherEveryone else here would send love too if they knew I was writing . Father asks after you several times a day . Rena has no doubt written you that , and all the other news . Sylvie may miss you worst of all . She is poorly and cross but keeps your room like a bandbox , ready . Come when you will and know you are wanted . I trust this will find you , since I do not think I could write it out again . I will use the only address you gave and hope that the Shenandoah Valley knows your name . Again , E.K.M.THE letter reached Rob in Bracey , Virginia  --  his Aunt Hatt 's kitchen  --  in the hand of Grainger , a clear Saturday noon in the middle of April . He had wandered a month after leaving home in the third-hand Chevrolet bought with the four-year savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left accompanied by Niles Fitzhugh , his oldest friend . They 'd intended to sightsee awhile at first  --  Petersburg , Richmond , Lynchburg , Lexington  --  then on up the Valley to Staunton where Niles had an older half-brother in hardware who had offered them jobs and room-and-board till they got on their feet . The trip went well in spite of the roads , fourteen punctures in the first three days . They saw any number of battlefields , pocketed a good many scrap souvenirs ( bullets , balls ) , talked with two fairly addled retired Confederates , seen the tomb of Lee ( and Traveller 's bones ) and gone to a whorehouse in Buena Vista called Roller 's Retreat ( they 'd reheatedeated more than once with girls much older than they 'd hoped to find yet grinning and ready , cheap and restful ) . But Staunton was a washout  --  ugly and all brick , tall pointed houses hung on the sides of hills like red shirts on pegs  --  and Niles 's brother had the jobs all right but also a wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of five . So Rob worked t here a week in misery till a mountain farmer built like a wharf rat accused hail of cheating ( a subtraction error ) , and he packed and left . The one week 's wages and the rest of his savings would fuel a little more looking round . So he drove across with some difficulty to Warm Springs Baths ; and finding it much too rich for his blood ( girls dying for husbands , mothers hoarse with urging ) , he slipped on down to Goshen Pass and stayed in ap152wild old widow 's boarding house and drank the strong waters ( more for fun than in hope ; he had drunk no liquor since leaving home with the single exception of some beer while retreating , to ease the sights ) and learned that a foreman was due there soon to hire on a crew to widen a road through the pass by the river once the spring weather settled . He would wait for that . In all those days he had thought very little of home or his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in quite as much anger as she 'd thought  --  more restlessness than anger , so he honestly believed ; she had forced their farewell to its cruel pitch  --  and the trip itself ( he had traveled so little ) had been specific to whatever sadness lingered . But once his chances of work seemed good ( his landlady said , " They 'll have to hire you ; not two other men in this whole county would know a road by sight if it ran in their front door and out the back and killed their wife , much less how to lay one " ) , he could take time to stop long mornings in bed , long evenings on porches ; and then he began to think of his life  --  all he did not know , had been denied . Three days of that , and the rusty alum water he drank from the springs , and he 'd sunk himself back dangerously near to the paralyzed misery he fled at home ; the four years of thankless loveless work in the thick immortal shadows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other half one Thursday night , having eaten his landlady 's leaden supper and answered her questions for an hour on the porch ( " You told me you 're saved ? Do I recollect that ? "  --  " You do , yes ma 'm . I was barely lost " ) and taken a lonely walk to the river with the town all asleep . Then oddly he dreamed not of his father but his father 's sister . He 'd had a face for her for some years now . Shortly after commencement , he had asked his Aunt Rena a single question one morning early while his mother was asleep  --  " Can you put your hands on a picture of my father ? " She had waited awhile  --  they were in the kitchen and Sylvie was present  --  then she 'd said flat " No . " But Sylvie had said , " Step yonder to the mirror " and pointed to her own piece of glass on the mantel . He had kept his seat , would not walk an inch to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back soon and walked straight to him and held out a picture , a good-faced woman plain as a board , two plain boys beside her . Rob had said , " Which one is he , then ? "  --  " Neither , " Rena had said . " They 're your cousins . She 's your aunt  --  Hattie Mayfield , married a Shorter , who died . "  --  " Does she favor my father ? "  --  " Not a bit , thank God , and neither do you . You 're a Watson to the ground ; Mother 's all over you . " Sylvie had shaken her head No , smiling . Rob had said to Rena , " Why do you have this ? " She had gently taken it from him then . " Because she sent it to me . When Mother died I wrote to her a time or two , knowing Eva was so weak from having you but wanting all the same to pass on the news , to punish everybody . I was great on punishment then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindness and pity and wrote me longp153letters about the good weather and spring in the hills and of how you were strengthening , so I asked her for this and she sent it down . ' When Eva came back , I broke off writing . " Rob had asked one other thing , " Where is she now ? "  --  " In Heaven maybe . Or Bracey , Virginia . She lived near there . " Alone in the mountains then , Rob dreamed of Hatt , a simple dream with no clear demands  --  she was doing man 's work , shoveling a stable clean . The stable was dim , lit by the open door toward which she worked and a far clouded window . Beneath the window on their haunches and hunkers were numbers of children , all boys , pale , their heads shaved . Their eyes were brighter than either source of light , and they watched the open door . They were waiting to run , past her and gone . The next morning Rob inquired again in town about the road-manduein five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked his landlady if she 'd hold his room through a long weekend while he visited family ( there was no other guest , slim chance of one till summer deepened ; he asked to be kind ) . She said " Not a chance "  --  alone as a rock  --  which forced him to pay her and leave with her grudge , one more set of eyes aimed cursing at his back ( he asked her to forward any letter that came in the next two days  --  Bracey , General Delivery  --  and , going out the door , he tried to say " See you Tuesday maybe " ; but she said " Do n't never try again " ) . He drove the whole rough seventy miles under heavy clouds , a piss-ant drizzle , occasional fog ; and when he 'd reached Bracey , he was so low and fearful as to make him think he would pass through toward anywhere  --  home even , any company . But he stopped of necessity at the one gas pump ; and when the storekeeper had filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past six o'clock , little daylight left  --  he stared up at Rob and said , " You a Mayfield , ai n't you ? " Rob said " What told you ? " The man kept staring , searching Rob 's face as though for some sort of goods that could be converted to use , quick cash . " Know all the Mayfields , " he said , " or knew them . You got to watch close to see a Mayfield at all  --  big runners . Whose are you ? " Rob said , " Hattie 's " for no clear reason ; " Where is she living ? " The man said , " You the oldest or what ? " Rob said , " The youngest , by a long shot the youngest "  --  a game by then , more dangerous than most he had ever played . The man 's whole face and body said fool or simpleton or scoundrel ; but finally he pointed , " She 's out there in that smile old piece of house where you boys left her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard they came in choirs , " Rob said and tipped his cap and drove on in the general direction . Two miles by the gauge till he saw a dark solitary house to the right and turned in there . He drove to the empty backyard , searching for lights ; and when he saw none , he still got down and headed toward the back steps . I f anyone was there , they would he in the kitchen . She was on the steps though , waiting for him trustingly  --  Ilatt alonep154in darkness , saying " Yes " as he touched the bottom step . Startled , really scared , Rob jumped back down but quickly recovered and laughed and said " Yes to what ? " She also laughed  --  did she have a gun , an axe ?  --  and said " Yes who are you ? " He paused over that and then said politely , " Excuse me asking but if you 'll go first , I 'll know if I 'm wasting your time or not . "  --  " Hatt Shorter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helpless as a girl . " She laughed again , a deep-fed laugh  --  " Which I 'm far from being . "  --  " Then I 'm Robinson , " he said . " Forrest 's boy . " They both waited then ; she must say the next . " Oh Jesus , " she said but it came through a smile , the sounds of welcome . She rushed him indoors to her strongest lamp and fed him enormously and asked him only the gentlest questions before suggesting he was tired and should sleep and leading him up to the small high room that had been his father 's when his father was a boy , though she did n't mention that till the following morning after heavy breakfast in clear spring light  --  late : he had slept past ten , deep , untroubled . HATT cleared the last dishes  --  the platter of steak and gravy , the last fresh biscuits  --  poured him more coffee ; then sat for the first time and said " You slept . " " I did , yes ma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't sleep , " she said . Rob looked up slowly to check her fervor . Was he stuck with a Christer ? She was smiling though , no zealot 's rictus . " I meant they were happy and never tired . Their search is ended . " He took a long draft of the strong tinny coffee . " So is mine , " he said . " Let me just say this  --  I 'm here out of nothing but polite curiosity . I do n't bear a grudge or a past-due bill for money or service , or a writ or nothing . I was just up in Goshen , waiting as I said for a job to start ; and dumb as it sounds , I dreamed about you , knowing your face from my Aunt Rena 's picture . " " Nothing dumb in that . I 've wondered if she ever showed you that picture , only good one ever made of me . And I 've dreamed about you for twenty-one years . " " Thank you , " Rob said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here on a visit , not a hunt or a raid . " I latt said , " I knew that . Your name 's Mayfield . All the Mayfields but me are short term guests  --  travel light , take no toll but gray hair and wrinkles on their poor fool hosts . I 've got them already so I 'm safe at last . "  |p155She  stroked at her clean bare face with her hands , combed back through her hair  --  seamy skin , gray hair . But the large eyes were happy , more nearly at rest . " You were in your father 's bed , " she said . Rob said " Is he dead ? " Hatt studied him closely . " You really do n't know ? " " No ma 'm . Not a word . " " Does n't Eva ? " " She claims not . I have to believe her . " " He 's alive , " Hatt said . " Fifty-four years old . " She stopped and knocked her front teeth with a knuckle , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , neck , face were a legible receipt of the tolls she had mentioned , all taken on her and no return ( her father , James Shorter , Forrest , her sons ; this nephew fresh-burgeoned at her table , demanding ) . ' file same knuckle knocked the table twice gently ; her eyes had never let go of Rob 's . " Will you use this right ? " He nodded . " Yes ma 'm . " " Wo n't hurt nobody with it ? " " No ma 'm , I 'm kindly . " He smiled at her broadly , a bid to break the tone . " You 're a Mayfield , " she said , "  --  Robinson at that . My father 's all in you . He 'd have hurt Baby Jesus if he needed to . " " Not me , " Rob said . " I promise , not me . " Ilatt knew he was wrong  --  not that he lied , only spoke in young ignorance  --  butshe said anyhow , He is living in Richmond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're dead ? " " Yes God , " she said . " Before you were born . Our own father too , Robinson your namesake . " " Is Father alone ? " " No , " she said . " He could never stand that . I 'm the hermit in the family . So it 's turned out at least  --  the best-natured one of all , the one that loves noise : here you see me on a windy hill , an old crow-roost ! " She had made herself smile ; it drained off slowly . " No he has a housekeeper ; been with him some years , ever since he moved there . She 's made him a home . I can thank her for that . " Rob waited to see if she 'd come to an end . Then he said " So can I. " It cost him nothing . " You wo n't be needing to see him though . " Hatt did not stay for an answer to that  --  it was not a question  --  but stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boiled through their talk ( she would wash his dishes ) . I t held a gallon and was heavy even for her strong arms ; but she stopped halfway between stove and sink and said , " You do n't hate him , do you ? " Roh laughed at once , the oddity of it . llid he hate squirrels in trees ,  |p156gra|pes  on vines ? They pertained more nearly . Yet he wanted to answer both truly and quickly ; she would hold the hot kettle there suspended till she heard . So he said " No surely , " which freed her to go on at least and pour the water . She poured it slowly and refilled the kettle from the bucket he 'd drawn her and set it on the stove and came back to sit again , a different chair , farther from him , opposite . She was waiting for more . " I 'm speaking only for me , " Rob said . " Nobody at home ever mentioned him . " " I 'd have guessed that , " Hatt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard time here . I knew she 'd never abuse your father 's name , whyever she left him . " He said " Why did she ? " Again Hatt waited ; she had not thought of this for a number of years . " I never thought she did . Of course about some things I know less than you  --  they were neither one talkers  --  but unless you convince me different today , I 'll go to my grave ( which wo n't be long ) claiming Eva Mayfield is waiting on him still . " " No ma 'm , she 's not . " " How come ? " Hatt said . " What else has she got ? " She answered herself  --  " You , to be sure . " " No ma 'm , " Rob said . Hatt thought and decided to let that stand . " Me either , " she said . " I repeat , here I am . I have raised a brother , kept a husband clean and fed , brought his two sons to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am fiftysevenyears old ; I 'm not even tired and all that 's left me is to scrub this old house that I still hate ( it was never mine : the Shorter place ) . " She waited , solemn awhile ; then she said " Well , I 'm naturally happy . " " Where are your boys ? " " Not here , God knows . The baby is buried in Flanders , I think  --  gassed , twenty-five , Whitby Shorter . Gid 's in Danville selling silk stockings , married to a woman that ca n't stand the country . I do n't much blame her ; she was raised on a hog farm a mile from here . I see them at Christmaswhen they ask me down , no pride at all . " Her whole face smiled , raw as a flayed dog . Rob said " You 'll live . " " I 'm living , thank you . " She nodded and stood and went to the sink . She turned her back and began to wash . " When have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A month or so . " " You do n't know exactly ? " " Yes . Thirty four days . " " How was she doing then ? " " The same , " Rub said . " She is always the same . "  | " That do n't tell me much , " Hatt said . " It 's been some time . " " You 'd know her . " " Is she pretty ? She was pretty as a girl . " Rob stood , reached into the pocket of his coat and found an oval velvet case . He opened it , looked a moment , then stepped toward Hatt and offered it to her . " I 'd ruin it ; I 'm wet . " So he held it for her  --  Eva , a girl , the miniature made from a picture taken just before her commencement , ordered by her father before the marriage but kept through the bad times and given by him to Rob on his twenty-first a month ago . She was turned to her right and showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round and fell down her visible shoulder , bare and full for her age . She wore a gold chain that had been her mother 's ( never worn since by anyone ) . Rob studied it again as carefully as Hatt . Despite his life , what he felt was pride  --  in the chance to carry and show such a likeness of what had once been alive and available , even in this house , for actual witness ; what was still ( only hours from here ) as grand in its darker less promising way . " That 's her , " Hatt said . " And she 's lasted , you say ? " " Very well , " he said . " If you 'd never seen her , you 'd know her from this . It was given to me just recently . " Still looking , Hatt said , " She would last , would n't she ? She would n't take wear ; she would not take it . You can choose that , you know  --  oh up to a point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll live , maybe thirty more years . " Hatt turned back to work . " Is she happy at all ? " " Yes ma 'm . Quite a lot . " " Doing what ? " Hatt said . " Her father , tending him . He takes a lot of care . " " He 's still alive ? Lord God , he 's a hundred . " " Oh no , " Rob said . " It just seems long . He has strokes regularly ; spells with his heart . " Hatt said , " Well , a job 's a job . " " I do n't know , " Rob said . " There 's all grades of jobs . " " What 's yours ? " Hatt said . " You told me ; I forgot . " She was almost finished ; she was scouring the pans . " No ma 'm , I did n't . I 've made two or three little messes since school , but I 'm out of work now . Plan to be back Monday ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No in Goshen . " " Dipping water ? Bathing ladies ? " She glanced back , laughing . " They like good rubs , the old ones specially . You 'd be just the ticket , strong hands and back ! " " I would , " he said , " if my heart did n't fail . The Kendals have bad hearts . "  |p158|pure  Mayfield , to look at at leastmy father , God help you . " She had not stopped smiling . " But you weretalking jobs . "  --  Road-building , " he said . " Through Goshen Pass soon as spring reallysettles . Dynamite and rockslides ; I may not live ! I 'm signing-on Monday . " Her smile did n't vanish but underwent a stiffening , the flush of painbehind it ; her teeth looked dry . " You 're leaving me then ? " Rob thought it was banter , mock family-pleading . " Afraid so , " he said . " I never promised more . " " And you 're not going home to Eva either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken a little , out here scot-alone ? " No ma 'm , least of all . I 'm not needed there . " " Who are you trying to kill ? " Hatt said . Her skin had tightened with the force of her anger . He tried smiling ; felt its uselessness and took two steps back , pocketingthe picture . " Maybe me , " he said . It seemed fresh knowledge but undoubtable . Hatt said " I could help you . " " By keeping me ? " " yes .  --  " Here on this hill ? " " I 'll close this tomorrow and bury the key if you 'll say the word . Goshen or Lynchburg , Fontaine even . I 'm a well-known cook and I 'm neat as a bird , eat practically nothing , sew like a spider . " Flat in abjection , she was cheering herself . It all was true but she offered it as fun . Rob smiled to help her , but he also weighed her offer . To his conscioussurprise , he felt himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made before  --  to ask for a life or to take the life offered ( they 'd been offered before ) . " I mean it , " Hatt said . " I know you do . " " What have you got better ? " He tried to think . " I knew the minute you drove up last night , you were bad off as me  --  once I seen your face . " " I am , " he said . " Do something about it . " " I want to , " he said . " Eva wo n't  --  " Ile raised a hand ; his eyes crouched inward . IIe intended to stop her . And she saw her mistake , flushed hot with regret . 13ut his gesture held on , a warning , listen . Steps on the backporch , the door , the hall . " Miss IIattie ? " A boy 's voice.  |p159She  said " All right . " A young Negro man  --  light-skinned , tall , lean  --  opened slowly , took a step toward them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out yonder . " He pointed through the wall . " I do , " she said . " It 's Forrest 's boy . " The man nodded to her ; he had not looked to Rob . " I knew that , " he said . He brought his hand up , a clean letter in it , and crossed the space between him and Rob . " This just come for you . They ask me to bring it . " He pointed again  --  toward town , the mail . Hatt said , " This is Grainger , Rob . He helps me on Saturdays . " Rob nodded half-smiling and took the letter  --  his mother 's script , forwarded from Goshen . Grainger 's empty hand stayed out so he shook it . " They did n't know who you was at the Mail ; thought you was your granddaddy . I told them better . I figured you was here . " Rob said " A little visit , " but his eyes and attention were all on the letter . " Yes sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " He saw he was ignored and understood the reason ; but he said to Hatt , " Ai n't we waiting , Miss Hatt ? " He was not ready yet to leave for the yard . " We were , " she said . " Fools forever ! He 's leaving any minute . Look at him while you can . " Grainger looked , frankly , gravely . But Rob said to Hatt , " I can stay through Monday if you 've got room for me . " " Room ? " she said . " I could put up the veterans of the Rainbow Division , no two in a bed ; and Grainger could cook  --  he 's a good egg cook . " " Yes ma 'm , " Grainger said . " Then I 'll go shave , " Rob said . " The day looks bright . Maybe I can help Grainger some , outdoors . " He was smiling but the sealed letter chilled his hand . Grainger said " Yes sir . " Hatt said " Take your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a service planned in advance , now rendered . When he 'd read the letter a single time , standing by his bed , he carefully tcturned it to its envelope and opened his small grip and buried it carefully  --  itsedges straight , right angles to the grip  --  beneath his clean linen ( washed in Goshen by his landlady , free ) . ' Then he went to the washstandp160and felt the kettle with the palms of both hands , not gingerly but reckless . It still was scalding so he poured it out , threw off his coat , fished out his razor , his badger-brush , the bar of castile soap worn to a coin , and lathered as best he could and shaved . An action as unpleasant as any in his life , though it gave him the silent minutes of thought in which he considered his mother 's refusals and generated his own reply . Finished , wiped clean , he slapped on cold raw alcohol and , every pore howling , emptied the water in the china slopjar . Then he wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last two inches of water , smoking still , and went to his coat and found the velvet picture case , opened it and carefully slipped out the porcelain on which the image lay , had lain these years . Eva as he all but remembered her  --  she 'd been this nearly , in his earliest memories ; this grand at least . He took it to the basin and with both hands gently laid it in the water ; let it rest for a minute  --  the face survived . Then he reached in again and scrubbed it with his thumbs till the water was pale brown , the porcelainwhite . He emptied that water too and dried the plate thoroughly , returned it to its case  --  a picture of nothing , a sheet of white china polished and ready  --  and put it into his pocket . Then he hooked on his collar and knotted his tie and went to the window and searched the view , a far round hill crowned with trees that were starting the annual revival . New yellow leaves hung like fume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cow , udder shrunk and slack as an empty glove ; a single dead tree at the edge of the yard , long dead , stripped of bark by years of weather till it stood in naked simplicity more nearly like a manmade thing than a former life ( a giant machine for lifting loads , a multiple gallows ) ; a few outbuildings all standing by little more than faith and grace , rotten at the ground , rotted halfway up ; and Grainger in a small patch of garden , plowing with an old one-wheeled pushplowwhose squeak Rob could hear , even high as he was and protected by glass . The sight of Grainger 's strength  --  in wrists , neck , shoulders  --  the speed of his gait as he scored hard dirt produced in Rob the one plain fact he had known all day , the one thing known which brought him hope , a chance of pleasure , rest : " That nigger can show me where to buy cheap liquor . " Among the many facts which this room offered for use and help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through , the bubbled pane . His mother had held him to that same glass a thousand times in three long months as she waited for strength after his hard assault , strength to bear him away ( or draw him behind her in her own fast wake ) . his father had seen him through that same glass on the clay Eva lei t t his house for good and changed many lives . Rob repeated what lie knew , a saving kernel in general famine  --  " llatt 's man will help inc. "  |p161A|pril  22 , 1925Dear Mother , I would thank you for your careful letter except that I do n't feel thanks are in order . I know that I asked  --  and hurt you by leaving ( why else would I leave ? )  --  and I know you took pains to speak your full mind . But also you gave pain and gave it so strong that I 'm just now coming up for breath and light , to see can I breathe and is it still day . You should be more careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  because you are fitted with terrible weapons ; and as I should have known , the worst is your voice : the things you know and can say , and will . Well , the worst is your face  --  my memories of hard times I 've caused your face  --  but your voice , on paper , can still cut rock . Not that I 'm any rock  --  fewer words would have worked to silence me , very nicely too  --  but I split anyhow into numerous pieces for several days . I want you to know . The letter found me in Bracey at Aunt Hatt 's . I had driven down there , not to harm anybody , least of all you ( barring your letter , I never would have told you I went at all ) , but out of curiosity and time on my hands . Was anybody still there ? Had anybody ever been ? Would any of them know me ? Two of them did  --  Aunt Hatt , who said I was pure Mayfield ( old Robinson my namesake ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grainger , who said he never saw you but worked for my father and so knew me on sight at once ) . And I was hoping to have a day or two to talk to them about various things  --  they were welcoming me ; the weather was dry  --  when your letter came , in Grainger 's hand , sent up the hill to that house by him , the house you knew , where I was born ; you are still all in it , especially upstairs ; you did n't need to speak , not while I was there anyhow . I was in the process of coming to understand a thing or two  --  one of them was you as a girl  --  and I had n't intended to stay long ; but you took care of that . The letter got to me about noon ; and by six I was well on my way to forgetting it , and you . I had to wait till then because Grainger was plowing and could n't stop to lead me to the nigger bootlegger ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already hurting  --  I called Aunt Hatt to come upstairs and said would she kindly help me out ? She had already offered help numerous times  --  she is all alone  --  though surely she never planned to have her seriousness tested so soon and in such a hard way , but anyhow she said " Yes " of course ; so I said , " Whether you know it or not , two of my ancestors killed themselves ; and I 'm wondering  --  what 's your advice for me ? " I handed her your letter . She took it and saw your handp162and put her big hand across my lips and said " God shut him up " with a broad deep smile . Did she smile all the time when you lived there ? Is she maybe a little simple by now ? Simple or not , she sat down by me on the edge of the bed where she said I was born and read it through slowly , tracing lines with her finger ; and then when she finished , she could n't look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on down at your signature and finally said " That 's your decision , Son . " I decided to live , not that minute though . I do n't think she meant to scare me but she did . She meant to tell the truth like you ; and she did ( will I ever have the luck to meet a lady that can lie ; tell me just what I need , not what I ask ? ) . No it took a little while to make up my mind ; and I spent the time hearing Aunt Hatt tell all she thought I should know . She said at the end it was all she knew . It may not have been . But it surely was enough to help me around some of what has lain across my path since I heard there was a path and that I must take it . I mean you mostly , and Father ( though he has not been a sizable worry , ever for me  --  anyhow now I know a lot more about him ; Hatt says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think she knows any ways to lie . Of course she has n't seen him for several years now since her younger boy Whitby was killed in Belgium and Father came down to stay a few days and see her through or so she says ) . She helped me to recognize you both as children ; and since I am likely to stay one myself , I can greet both of you  --  as you were then , before me  --  and wish you the luck you will not have . The luck that would have left you safe enough , free enough , to allow you to love not honor me  --  your freezing offer , honor . I never was honorable and never want to be . So the child got drunk by dark as I said and did a good deal of raving around in the local hills  --  some dangerous driving , mechanical damage ( cost me fourteen dollars ) ; and I cut myself , not in very much earnest as I already hinted but enough to scare Grainger who was with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to go home to Hatt 's and try to sleep . So he drove me there after mending a puncture in night thick as grease ; and what I discovered in no time at all was that whatever Aunt Hatt is good at , and she claims wide skills , she is what I would call a pisspoornurse for a drunk . Pardon French . This is all meant to be fairly painful , you see  --  just a boy , make allowance . The first thing she did was to start warming milk  --  I should drink hot milk ; you know you 're in trouble when they start heating milk  --  so I waited for that , laid down on the old leather couch in the hall outside the kitchen and waited in peace ( peaceful to onlookers ; different within , though easier by then ) ; and what did I hear in the next five minutes ?  --  her whispering to Grainger , him going outside and coining back in , then some more low talking , then the awful sound of pouring . Size had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouring it out in her old slop-pail . Her idea ofp163help . Poured the last pure drop , and I lay there and listened . I did n't say a thing . I waited till she said , " Can you come drink your milk ? " Then I kind of walked in and sat at her table . She had made a bowl of milktoast ; and someway , I ate it . She and Grainger watched me awhile ; then she told him to bring her some wood  --  to get him out . When she had us alone she of course said " Why ? " and I think I told her . You already know and I thought she did , though another thing I 'm coming to know about women is that none of them understands forgetfulness , that a sane strong man might need to forget a thing or two ( temporarily of course )  --  no women I 've met . Why is that , do you think ? Are they scared the thing you 'll forget is them , and permanently ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grainger got me upstairs and put me to bed  --  I was able by then ; but I let them do it : most fun they 'd had since the big ice storm  --  and scared as I was being there on that hill just started on my comfort and it all wasted in with Hatt 's hogslops , I went on to sleep and slept like a great long trip to whatever 's in the heart of the ground : not a sound , not a sight , not a soul trying either to harm or help . Of course I came-to around four o'clock . She 'd left a lamp lighted in the corner of my room , dark as Hell outside ; and I looked at the little flame and prayed a good while . I just kept praying all you told me to pray  --  " Thy will be done "  --  oh for maybe half an hour . So apparently what happened next was God 's perfect will . I got out and dressed and made it downstairs without waking Hatt up ; and what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get out the back way and crank my car and find that bootlegger one more time . Hatt sleeps like a chain on the ocean floor . But Grainger was awake . What had n't dawned on me was that I 'd been so bad off that evening that Grainger volunteered to sleep in the downstairs hall on the couch . Do you recall the couch ? It must have been there ( must have been at the circumcision of Moses , the making of the hills ) . A rock could n't rest on it , much less Grainger ; so when I tipped past him , he just said " What ? " and I said , " You know . You let her ruin me . " He said , " I did . I asked her to stop . I knew what you felt . "  --  " No you do n't , " I said ; " I 'm going back for more . "  --  " And I 'm coming , " he said . Someway we got out without waking Hatt  --  maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Grainger did the driving plus saving my life . He 's here with me now . How that worked out was that after we had waked up the poor bootlegger and bought what he had left ( he 'd had a big Saturday )  --  a quart of brandy buried out in a shed  --  Grainger drove me on to his place . I 've been in worse , been drunk in worse ; so we sat down there and before day broke or I got scared again , Grainger talked to me about his life and I truly listened . We are half first-cousins according to him  --  old Robinson grand fathered both him and me . Said he never did know it till my father told him . Ile worked for my father from the time we left for a year or so ; had grown up in Maine but came down to Bracey to visit somep164ancestor named Aunt Veenie and met his Uncle Forrest Mayfield , your husband , and lived with Forrest as long as he could ; then lived with his Bracey ancestor till she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the army in France  --  " Digging trenches for white boys to climb out of into sheets of fire ; I stayed low , digging , and here I sit alive as you "  --  then came back here and had a dark wife ( who is now long-gone up north somewhere , though he says he expects her eventually ) and worked as janitor in the school and some churches . He also reported that my father is happy , though he has not seen him for some years either and only speaks of him in the distant past . He has a few books that belonged to Father , just children 's books . He can still read in them . He read me the story of Pocahontas when he 'd finished with his own  --  " She died of a broken heart beneath foreign skies with memories of the green woods of east Virginia , the swarming streams , from whose sweet shallows she is still divided by the thousands of leagues of rolling salt deep by which she sleeps her longing sleep . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned them at times . At the end he offered the book to me , saying I might want some part of my father , that he knew it by now ; but I left it with him since he seemed to care , and anyhow he has been on that rolling deep which I never have . By then it was light and , all things together ( the brandy half-gone ) , I was feeling pretty firm on my feet again  --  well , able to stand  --  so I said would he drive me to Aunt Hatt 's again and I 'd eat and rest and then head for Goshen ? He said was I ready to face her yet ? I said " Meaning what ? " and he said , " She 'll have to abuse you some before she lets go . " I said that I had to get my grip someway  --  it contained a few objects of sentimental value not to mention my drawers  --  and he said if I 'd just wait a little while longer , she 'd be at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unseen . I said " Fair enough " but that I needed something to eat and some air . The house we were in was his old ancestor 's and still smelled like her , though it looked clean as Sylvie 's or ours for that matter . I ought to have known there was no cafe for twenty miles round , that he 'd offer to cook . He did  --  " Miss Hatt say I cook good eggs "  --  and I did n't want to harm one more damned soul ; so I said I 'd be grateful , and he went out and squeezed his old Dominecker hen and cooked me up a breakfast as good as I 've seen . I could n't eat much so I told him to finish , but he said he was not a big eater and did n't . Then he said did I still want to take a walk ? I had mentioned air  --  I was thinking of a ride  --  but I said " All right , " thinking lie might have some famed local beautyspot he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . Of course I 've never done much for her . ) It was nothing but a little house  --  one-story , three rooms , painted yellow mice , a front porch , a johnny  --  where he and Father had lived for a while alter you and I vanished , lle said it had been empty more than a year . Some local boy came Koine from teaching piano at Johns Hopkins ,  |p165Baltimore  , and moved in to spend a summer for his nerves and wound up shooting himself on the porch in sight of his mother 's house across the valley early one morning . She may not have watched  --  Grainger did n't know that  --  but he lay there with what was left of his head till way after noon when some passer found him . No takers since then . We walked right in and Grainger took me round it , telling where things had stood , where little things happened . He had been twelve , thirteen years old and had slept on a little cot back in the kitchen . Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would stay home and clean while Father taught school , go to see his ancestor , help her get around , come back and study in the afternoon ( Father made him recite a lesson every night  --  reading and simple figures , household management , a little agriculture , mythology : " Ladies changing to trees ; being stole by bulls , great birds , swans , eagles ! " ) ; then he 'd start their dinner and Father would come . He showed me father 's room . The bed was still there  --  they had got it all furnished  --  a narrow child 's bed with side-rails Grainger had lengthened for Father so his legs could stretch . It was Grainger 's site , see ? He wanted to show it . He was still proud of it . So I let him talk on and listened politely but did n't really calculate where he would end . He said , " Listen , you 've left the only home you got . You hurting all over . You could rent this place , get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'd move in here and keep it nice for you . Or I could still stay at Miss Veenie 's where I am and walk over here  --  it ai n't any ways . That 'd help you a lot . " I am in demand . Mother , understand this  --  there are numerous people by now , none crazy , who have asked to spend full time with me . I am not bragging now ; I am hoping to show you  --  they recognize something , and in me . I 've asked myself what in God 's name it is  --  Aunt Rena , Min , Hatt , even Sylvie , now Grainger  --  and I think I know : they see me in need and they see I am loyal which means to them that I 've got gold to give . I have . They are right . But not for them . I must choose my own and already have . I thanked him and said someday I might need a set-up like that and would call on him then . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder than he should have ; so I thought it was time to conclude the tour and dodge Aunt Hatt and head for Goshen . I could drive by then  --  I was clear as the day , which was already perfect  --  but I let Grainger do it so as not to hurt him too far ; and since my hands were idle awhile , they occupied themselves with the rest of the brandy . Grainger never said " No "  --  a true drunkard 's friend  --  and by the time we pulled up in Hatt 's poor yard , I had fallen into something like the Sleep of the lust ( Just could n't stand up ! ) . When I knew myself again , we were three-fourths to Goshen . It was midafternoon and Grainger was driving like he had good sense and knew my will . Alaybe he does . I sat up as best I could and looked out ( try thatp166after sleeping several hours in a Chevrolet on mountain roads and you full of homemade-brandy and eggs ) . I said " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . Going where you said . " So I laid back and he got us on in to the edge of Goshen and then stopped and said , " Can you drive on from here ? " I could but I said " What about you ? " of course . He said , " I 'll head on back if you 're ready . "  --  " How ? " I said ; " It 'll be dark soon . These are mountains , boy . You fall and you 're gone . " He said that was all right ; so I had to say , " No , come on with me and stay till tomorrow ; and I 'll get you over to the downhill train . " He nodded to that and rolled ahead and left me with something like half a mile to decide two things  --  a place that would take a man looking and smelling like me , plus a bed for a Negro in a county where Negroes are scarce as smiles . I knew my old widow had meant what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just move on to the country beyond and sleep on the ground ( I had that afghan you gave me years ago ) ; but then I remembered a place I 'd passed on the far side of town , rundown but big , an old-time resort . I 'd seen a Negro girl out sweeping the yard there , so at least I knew Grainger would n't scare them dead . I guided him to it ; and when we pulled up in front he said , " You do n't care nothing about yourself . You ai n't staying here . "  --  " We got to , " I said . And three days later , we 're still staying here  --  me in the main building , him in some old quarters left out back . I 'm waiting on the foreman of the roadbuilding gang and so now is Grainger . A true Mayfield . He has got a job already and decided to stay . A number of reasons , all of them simple . This whole thing is simple . What I 'm saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very simple : what is wrong with me . I am just twenty-one . I have just started this . I can be turned around . It could easily be helped . Help then , Love , RobRon mailed his letter in the late afternoon ; then walked awhile to clear his head and hands ; then ate a light supper in the hotel dining room , empty but for him and the owner Mr. Hutchins and Grainger who , as one of his jobs , helped Della serve what little there was ( Della being the girl Rob had seen in the yard , the cook and maid ) . Then he sat on the porch and listened again to dlr . Hutchins ' plans to rejuvenate his property in hopes of a new influx of guests provided by the road that was coming through -- lime ate people right now all over Virginia just as sick as dogs and no way to get here for this good air and this stinking water but that mountainp167track that 's killed more dozens than I 'd care to admit . Not even counting Maryland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road and I 'll be here ready . " Rob said , " Will you have a doctor by then ? You 'll need a doctor . " He referred to the fact that Mr. Hutchins ' wife had been in Lynchburg six weeks apparently to keep a sick daughter under doctor 's care . Mr. Hutchins said , " They 'll be here , have to beat them back with sticks when they see that traffic all green with money . They follow the color green if you notice . That 's been my experience . You may have doctorsin your family that are saints . " Rob said , " No sir , we are sick as dogs too . Why you think I 'm here ? " Mr. Hutchins said , " Smart but you 're several months early . " Rob said " Do or die " and excused himself and went to his room . There he lit his lamp and tried to write again  --  a note to his Aunt Hatt : apology and an explanation of Grainger 's disappearance , a promise to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to her and be a loyal nephew  --  but after two starts , there seemed no need . She would either forgive him in the weeks of silence or add him to the roll of those who 'd left her and could never earn pardon . Then he stood to undress and was down to his skin when a voice said " Rob ? " beyond his door  --  Grainger , whispering . Rob half-opened on him and saw he was alone and said , " Step in . Make yourself at home . I 'm bound for the arms of Morpheus " ( Grainger had been coming to his room each night with the stated intent of discussing the day , their chances for life here , but really  --  Rob knew  --  to check on his health , the state of his mind ) . Rob went to the bed and entered it deftly as though this were winter , not warming April . Grainger came in and shut the heavy door behind him and sat in the one straight chair by the lamp and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm older than you and have wasted enough of my time on liars ; so please tell me true  --  you honest in saying you mean to stay here ? " " All depends , " Rob said . " On what please ? " " On whether I get a decent job tomorrow , whether I can do the work once it begins ( I 've never built nothing ) , whether anybody back home should need me . Hell , Grainger , I could die in my sleep tonight . " Grainger studied him hard by the warm steady light  --  the wide chest propped dark against the dark walnut , muscled as though he had hauled great burdens in heavy harness since the day he could walk , not swum through a life like warm bathwater ; the face with its calm breadths on which you could lay your whole flat hand if the skin itself did n't threaten to bum with a fierce life flickering out from the eyes which could watch you as steady as a picture of Jesus , as full as Jesus of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healed , perfect peace arrived . Grainger smiled . " You not dying no night soon , less some girl kill you . "  | " Then I 'm safe , " Rob said . " Do n't know but one girl from here to Buena Vista and she works nights . " " Mine too , " Grainger said . " You getting into Della ? You 're moving , boy . " Grainger laughed a little , nodding ; but then he said , " Listen , I 'm lying again . Della 's nice to me but I ai n't touched her once and may not never . " " You 've got my permission , " Rob said . " Go to it . " Grainger nodded again . " If I need to go . " " You 'll need to , " Rob said , " in this good air . " Grainger thought ; then said , " It puts the stiffening in you all right ; but I 'm waiting , I guess . " " What on ? " Rob said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to just leave this room this morning  --  she was spreading my bed and giving off power . " Grainger said " On Gracie . " " If she 's ever coming back , you taking a little fun here wo n't stop her . " " Yes it would , " Grainger said . " I feel like it would . " Rob said " Is she worth it ? " Grainger said , " Nobody asked me that before . " Rob wanted to ask his pardon but could n't . " She used to be anyhow  --  to me , just me . Everybody else but me called her trash  --  Miss Veenie , your daddy . " " What did you call her ? " Grainger visibly retired into memory , pictures . Then he said , " Nice . She was just the nicest somebody I ever knew . " He seemed prepared to stop . " What way ? " Rob said . " Every way you can mention  --  at the stove , in the bed , at church ; she could sing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she suited me . I could watch her all evening . I could sit here right now and watch her till morning , if she was where you are , just to see her wake up and take first light  --  an easy riser ; she can speak right off , do n't have to go dragging around till noon . First time she pass a whole night by me , after Miss Veenie die , I 'm lying there watching her and day creeping in ; and she breathe deep once ( her eyes still shut ) and say out loud , I am certainly pleased . ' " Grainger stopped again . " So I 'm waiting on her . " Rob said , " Go to it . But my father  --  what did he have against her ? " " Same thing everybody did . She after your money . ' So what if she is ? Ai n't nothing but money . Nobody but mc dug trenches to get it ; let mc give it where I please . No , money scares people . Scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys coining home from the U.S. Army , shovels in one hand and money in the other . Scared people to death ; thought we 'd buy up land , you see , and own the damn world . Two or three did , little poor piece of dirt ; but you want to know the truth ? " " Yes . "  | " You want to know who saved the world from niggerboys ? " " Sure . " " Mr. Henry Ford . " " How ? " " Model T. Every nigger had to have one , poured his money down it , saved the land for white folks . " Grainger ended smiling . " Good thing , " Rob said , smiling also . But tired as he was , he would not be derailed by a joke , even true . " Why did my father care either way ? " he said . " You had left him by then . " " He wanted me to get some more education . Wanted me to buy it with my army pay . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I left home in Maine  --  1904  --  except what he taught me when I lived with him and those little children 's books I read through the years . When the Armistice was over , he got my address in France from Miss Veenie ; had n't heard from him once in all that digging , and him about the only one I knew that could write . He wrote to me then and said was I still alive and , if so , take my money and come to this school he was teaching at in Richmond ; said I was n't too old and could better myself for the time Miss Veenie died and I was alone ; said he would help me again , all he could . He was teaching niggers how to write their name , read about old gods . " " You turned him down . " Grainger nodded . " Right flat . I did n't tell myself I was going to though . I got home that April on a boat to Norfolk ; and I headed straight to Bracey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and four years old . She was picking cotton ! Or claimed she was ; her mind came and went . She could walk in the yard , kick the chickens some ; but she had n't picked cotton in eight or ten years . Picked me was what  --  picked on me terrible : buy her this or that , warm her up , knock her up ( said she wanted a baby ) . I knew it was age and would n't last long ; and I knew she had been good to me as anybody  --  three times better  --  but she wore me down those first weeks at home ( I was long out of practice ) ; so I was half-thinking about your daddy 's suggestion . Had n't written to him though . Then I come on Gracie , at the church , spring meeting . Had n't told Miss Veenie I was going even or I 'd have had to tote her , and she could n't hear a cannon ( just gave her a big drink of liquor with her supper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down there to listen to some noise . Missed the biggest noise though ; she had finally shouted just before I got in , Gracie had . Been on the mourner 's bench two whole days , not eating once , just to get religion . See , she was seventeen and time was getting late  --  you want to get religion as soon as you can , get your habits all set . Well , Gracie got it late ( and I never got it ) ; but they said she made up for lost time , shouting . Said she climbed over six rows of heart-pine benches yelling Safe , Jesus , safe ! ' When I walked up though , they had her in the yard  --  her auntie , old Sandra ( her folks were gone , turned out to be dead )  --  and were giving her little drinks of water from the well . I did n't know what she 'd beenp170through , you see ; so I stopped right beside her and said Where you been ? ' Back then I thought I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since a baby ; she had stayed right in Bracey ) , and I meant it just for fun ; but she looked me dead-straight and said Near to Heaven ' and I said I believe you '  --  her expression , I mean : she was light as a blaze . I had known her forever ; but I had n't never seen her lit-up like that  --  nobody else had  --  so what I told myself ( in my head , standing there ) was , love at first sight . " " And believed it , " Rob said . " Had to , " Grainger said . " Never felt it before , first sight or fiftieth . " " What ? " Rob said. "  --  That I wanted her company from then on out everywhere I would go . " " Did you tell her that night ? " " No , God , " Grainger said . " My first mistake . I ought to said , Sandra , I 'm taking her now ' and carried her with me back to Miss Veenie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here she is . She is something I want , first thing in years ; so do n't say one word that sounds like No : " " But you did what ? " Rob said . " Tried to be nice like everybody taught me . See , I had n't never wanted nobody before  --  little fun now and then but fun is easy  --  so I thought you went after people you wanted the same way you went after money or dinner : smiling and asking . It worked for a while ; she had never been asked , just told , and she answered . " " What did she say ? " " Various things ; we had three years . At first it was mostly just Lead and I 'll follow . ' And since I was fresh from the U.S. Army , I knew how to lead !  --  straight into the woods . We did n't come out but to eat and sleep . What I 'm telling you is , it was new to me . I had been kept back by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way back but far enough so what she was offering was new ground to me . I felt like the white men seeing Pocahontas , first time of all . I do n't think she minded  --  she knew more than me ; several ways to Heaven and she 'd tried them all . So it was n't too long till the tune started changing to Come here to me ; eat out of my hand . ' I heard her changing and I came right on . What I am  --  you know it  --  is obedient . To people I love . No other way to thank em . Rob nodded and said , " Please blow out the lamp  --  mosquitoes , I think . " ' When Grainger had done that and sat back down and they were dark , Rob said , " Iler hand , the one she was holding out  --  what was she offering in it to cat ? " Grainger thought awhile . " That was just my way of putting it , " he said. " hitting what though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already told you . You already know.  |p171Every  member of your family know it by now  --  Grainger got a good heart . Ile like to help . " " Thank you , " Rob said . " But why is that ? " " That 's something I know , worked it out in France . See , all the army gives you is time to think ( last thing you need to be is a soldier ) . Reason is , I had such a happy life . Till I got down in them trenches and mud , had n't nobody done one mean thing to me that I could remember . Good mama and daddy , Miss Veenie good as gold till she got crazy , your daddy , Miss Hatt . Not to say I had n't heard some hard words now ; I 'd learned trench-digging in Camp Dix , New Jersey . I 'm speaking of deeds ; they 'd all been kind . And even the Germans were n't aiming at me . Nothing personal , you see . So I been good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niggers been telling me all my life  --  you a sapsucking fool . I 'm the nigger that 's warm though , good roof on my head . " " But you did n't please Gracie ? Is that why you 're waiting ? " In the dark Grainger could n't test Rob 's face for cruelty . The voice seemed only curious though , a further need . " I would n't say that . And I do n't think if you could find Gracie , she 'd say that either . She 'd say Grainger done a lot better by her than any other man before him or since . She say that in every message she send me ( I taught her to write a few words and she writes em  --  Needing to see you , Coming home soon , Cold up here ; I did n't never show her how to spell cash money , but I send it to her anyhow ; it might be her fare ) . No I 've worked on that a whole lot too , her going to Newark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maine and traveled back and forth on Seaboard trains and been to France , been to cast New Jersey ; so I know what she do n't yet  --  it 's all one place ; there are just different people . She learning that in Newark , put it in her last message  --  Nobody nice as you north of you . " " When is she coming then ? " " When she get ready . " " How will she find you , off in the mountains ? " " I already wrote her my new address . Told her my plans . " " What are they ? " Rob said . " To stay by you long as I 'm helping out or till she need me worse . " Grainger said it as fact , expecting no reward now or ever , only the chance to pass what time still stretched before him in ways he understood and had been good at . And no reward came from Rob . Silence . Then the sound of him sliding down flat on the bed , a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry sound of skin on cloth , all dark , came over Grainger like word of refusal , a bad long minute of possible death . He worked to survive . In a low voice , low enough to leave Rob asleep if he 'd already gone , he said " You believe Inc ? " Considerable silence ; then Rob 's voice , normal . " I believe you , " hep172said . Exhausted as he was from his own hard day , his effort to tell a whole truth to his mother and endure the tale , Rob thought he believed what Grainger had offered , a pitiful fool 's life story to now , and thought he could bear Grainger 's gamble on him . Even fully awake and his mind at ease , Rob would not have thought to search farther in , would not have believed that a search through Grainger 's omissions and lies would have yielded the real help Grainger could give , the lifelines extending toward a center of rest in the scattered heart of his hurtful family  --  the dream Grainger dreamt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was seated on a train that moved through successionsof day and night as he stared out the window at fields and towns in the gradual process of undergoing spring  --  leaves , blossoms , grass . There were several more passengers ; but he was alone , a small wicker satchel in the rack overhead ( his father 's , containing his change of clothes ) . He thought as he rode through the various days that he had no baggage or worry but the satchel  --  young as he was he could handle that  --  and he thought he was headed to his great-great-great grandmother 's , Veenie 's in Virginia . Simple destination . She would be there to meet him , give him all he lacked . So he thought he was happy and smiled at himself in the window-pane whenever they passed through tunnels or darkness . He thought that he only needed to wait ; his trip would happen like spring to the land . Then the train stopped awhile  --  no town , open country  --  and the whitehaired Seaboard conductor came to him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new place to sit . Good place . You follow me . " The conductor reached up and brought down the satchel and said " Is that all ? " When Grainger said " Yes sir , " then he led the way on back through cars  --  white cars , black cars  --  to a final car with a single seat . He pointed Grainger to it and stowed the satchel gently in the single rack and then , still smiling , the conductor said , " Now you 're sure you 've got your message ? " Grainger said " Yes sir " and the old man left . Alone , he was miserable . He did not have a message and did not understand , could not even think what a message was or who one would be for if it blossomed now in the palm of his hand ( Miss Veenie needed nothing ; she was well-off in life as his father said ) . He stood on the plush scat and searched through his satchel  --  two unionsuits , two pants , two shirts , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or useful to anyone but him . So lie rode on in misery another long while till the old than cane hack and said " You 're there " and took down the satchel and said again " You 've got it ? " and led liiui to the steps down . ' Floe train was in Bracey , Stopping at the station . The old man said , " You'vep173been a good rider " and went down first with his satchel ; then lifted him slowly through warm air to the ground and said " Goodbye " and climbed back and vanished . No Veenie in sight , no other soul . They know I have let them down and are gone . I am left here forever , nobody but me . Then a man stood above him  --  white , the age of a father  --  and promised kindness , though he did not smile . He held out a big hand and said , " Please . You 've brought it . It 's meant for me . " Grainger said , " No sir . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face clouded , sadness not meanness ; and he said , " You 're sure ? Try hard to recall . " Then Grainger knew , sudden and whole , and said it out quickly , " Forget all that please . All that 's over . They say tend to me . " The man , whom he saw then as Forrest , smiled and reached for his hand . No thought of Veenie or the long trip behind him . In his sleep on his back in cold mountain air , Grainger also smiled , though alone and dark , stretched his long legs and rolled to his belly . Long hours of rest . RoB also dreamt  --  after Grainger , toward morning  --  a dream which brought him no news or rest , only further pictures of a knowledge he was powerless to use or abandon . He stood in the door of an army barracks  --  French , in Flanders . He thought he was searching for his Cousin Whitby Shorter , had been sent by his Aunt Hatt to rescue Whitby . The room was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpainted  --  and seemed entirely empty of all but its furniture : many rows of beds . So his search must consist of walking down the rows , each separate bed . They were oddly built ; same wood as the walls , crudely nailed into long deep flatbottomed boxes like coffins or mangers . One by one they were empty of all but bedding . Each contained an identical wad of bedding , a brown cocoon of quilted cloth thrown back by the rudely awakened sleeper to show his leavings , dried plaques of stain  --  some colorless , some bloody , some excremental . No single exception ; all were fouled , though none gave clues to the occupant 's name or whether he meant to return here at night  --  whether rest were possible in this dry filth  --  or had left in revulsion or spilled all his wastes through a wound on the field . So why was he hunting a cousin here ? No hope of his presence . He would be underground , returning to dirt , or fighting above it . Rob thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the door . The last row he walked down was like all the others except that on one bed midway down its length a person was seated , lap covered by quilting , toward whom Rob walked  --  his mother , a girl , longhaired , in tears . She did not sec him . ' 1'l-c search was for her.  |p174May  27,1925 Dear Alice , I feel awful not to have written you till now . But since it is really the only thing I feel awful about at present and since I am devoting an hour of my twentieth birthday to you  --  today : you forgot but how could you remember ? I never told you  --  I trust you will forgive me and reply very soon and set a firm date for your promised visit here . Set it late in June though or early July  --  come for the Fourth and maybe I will explode  --  since Father said , when Mother showed him Dr. Matthews ' letter , that I must rest on for at least two months , just sitting and staring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live till then . Oh my chest is strong  --  I doubt it was ever weak  --  but my nerves may be hanging in strips by then from all this stillness . It has always just been nerves from the start . No actually , they are strong now too ; and when I have told you the news that follows , I think you will guess the remedy that 's worked when nothing else seemed to  --  your father 's medicines , your mother 's good food , even your own high spirits and jokes . You remember that a strange Negro turned up to get us in a strange Chevrolet ? That was only the first two surprising links in a chain that ends , I think , in a heart  --  a large heart containing a wonderful face , strange to me till now but likely to heal , I fervently hope . You remember also that Father never wrote us more than duty demanded , so how could we know that he 'd done a good deal of moving in our absence ? The Negro again was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April to help Father put the old place here in shape for what Father guesses is a golden wave of guests heading toward us on a new east-west road running through the mountains which is just now beginning to be widened from this end ( the previous quick wary to get here from eastward was to make prior plans to be born on the spot ) .  |p175One  of the builders is Robinson Mayfield . He is the face contained in the heart toward which all the recent surprises lead . Twenty-one years old and not well himself ; with him also it is nothing but nerves . From the start of it though . The trip home was rough . I was weak from all the resting ; and the new Negro  --  Grainger  --  told us nothing substantialof the changes at home , only that he 'd been hired shortly before and that the Chevrolet belonged to a man who was boarding with us while he worked on the road . Father 's old car was laid up as usual , so he 'd offered the man a bargain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chevy . It got us here at least ; but I wo n't be needing Grainger to drive me again  --  Donner and Blitzen ! And what was waiting at first was just Father . He may not have written much ; but he has been worried ( I told you he lost his own mother and a sister with galloping consumption , though long years ago ) . The signs of that were that he met us in the yard , kissed Mother and me ( he is not a big kisser ) , tipped Grainger a dollar in the presence of us all ( my father and dollars are magnet-and-iron ) , and then said Della would show me my room . I told him I remembered quite well where it was  --  it had been mine forever  --  but he said " No you do n't " ; and he and Della led inc ( Della is the maid ) . He had changed my room  --  every stick , every picture  --  and set me up in what used to be the old Bridal Suite on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and no bridal couple ever crossed - the doorsill in my recollection , but a big high room with good exposure to cross-ventilation . All for my chest , when all my chest needs is just a little padding ! Well , it was very thoughtful and I did appreciate it , even if I noticed he 'd neglected to paint the old walls ( the chest may fail ; no need to splurge yet ! ) . But when they all went out and left me to rest for the hour before supper , I was low as a mole . And because of Father . In spite of your father 's long letter explaining that now I was largely out of danger and could live my life , here he was intending to shore me up in a run-down resort that if he poured thousands of dollars into would not draw flies , much less rich Virginians if he offered to bring them here in his arms over that new road ( and all he intends to pour is a trickle  --  ten dollars here , thirty-five dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what a place to die !  --  a hotel swarming with loud old ladies . I am not going to die , but I prayed to then . I 'll admit it to you . I lay on my bed on April 3oth and prayed to God to strike me with everything they thought I had  --  failed lungs , failed mind  --  but make it quick please . I meant it so much that I said it out loud , some part of it anyhow  --  I was in the Bridal Suite ; nobody was near . Or so I thought ( my mind is weak ) . Somebody knocked in the midst of a groan . I thought it was Father or Mother at least ; so I had to say " All right , " still lying down . And there stood this strange man looking concerned . I sat straight up and said " You 're in the wrong pew " ( I was fully dressed ) . IIe said , " I was hopingp176to save a life  --  heard a soul in distress . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Give a groan ; let me hear you groan . " I gave a little groan and he said , " You 're lying ; that was you just now . " Well , in spite of his looks , he was dirty as a clam ( he had just come from work  --  blasting rock since dawn  --  but I did n't know that ) ; so I said , " So what please ? And who are you ? " He said " I 'm the groom . " I must have looked baffled ; so he said , " The bridegroom . I live in the other half of the Bridal Suite . " ( It turned out he did  --  our new paying guest ; Father had given him the other room ; mine was secondbest . ) I said , " What 's the groom 's name then , please sir ? " ; and he said , " Rob Mayfield the Second , and willing . " I decided not to go a step farther that way but said , " I am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know . Know all about that . "  --  " Tell me then , " I said ; " I sure God do n't . " He waited a whole minute , staring hard at me . " You 're better , " he said . " In fact , you 're well . " I said " Who says ? " He said " My eyes " and touched his eyes .  --  " Are they truthful ? " I said . He said " You decide " and walked forward to me . So I sat to the edge of the bed for that , my feet on the floor in case Father came  --  he 'd have shot Rob dead . They were brown . I can never tell about brown eyes . " What 's the verdict ? " he said . I said , " They go very well with your hair ; that 's as much as I know . "  --  " Or ever will , " he said . I was ready to get mad , but Della walked up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or would I come down ? I found I 'd decided to trust the eyes . I said I 'd join everybody downstairs as soon as I 'd washed ; and since everybody was nothing but my parents plus Rob Mayfield , I 've hardly been back upstairs since then . That was almost a month ago ; and more things have grown than just the flowers , mainly my care for Rob . To tell the pure truth , I will have to say that my care has grown both higher and deeper than Rob 's for me . Apparently at least . He often does n't get back till long past dark and then is tired and eats in the kitchen and is something of a night walker ( easing his nerves ) , and Father watches me like a hawk ; so until last weekend I knew little more than the thing I felt , which was happiness to know he was in the world or that I was in a world which offered him  --  when these recent months I 've suspected much worse . He came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and stretched out to rest on his bed before supper ; I knew because I 've learned to read his life through walls . I was also " resting , " as per Father 's orders , though what I was actually doing was straining in every nerve to hear when he 'd rise and which way he 'd walk . I was testing my strength ; could I cause him to come to my door and knock and say something hopeful ( the previous two nights he had either been exhausted and had barely spoken or had gone out riding with some boys on his crew ) . I was thinking , " Now get up and help me please . Nobody else can need you like me , " I was also working against the clock  --  the dinner hell . Della would be ringing it at six.  |p177Then  with four minutes left , he stood to the floor and waited a little on the rug by his bed and opened his door and walked down to mine and knocked once so lightly as to be heard only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay still myself , I went to the door and opened it on him ; and he said  --  no greeting , never calling my name  --  " I know you 've got a birthday coming next week . I 'll be working of course , and you 've got your family ; but I 'd like to help you celebrate tomorrow afternoon . A picnic maybe . " I said the next three things in backward order  --  Yes ; who had told him ? ; I would have to ask Father . He said he did not remember , maybe Grainger , and that if I wanted he would speak to Father and assure him of his wish not to tire me out . I thanked him and said No , I 'd better handle that ; and he said again , " I just want to help you celebrate . " It came true . Nobody ever helped me more . After supper that night  --  nobody left at table but Father and me , and Della clearing  --  I said , " Could I ride out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good lunch ? " He stared down awhile and then just said " Whose idea is it ? "  --  " Rob 's , " I said . " He is trying to help me . " He stared awhile longer and gave no sign of answering ; so I said , " Do you want me to go on and die ? " He looked up and checked me for seriousness and said , " That is not my intention , no . " Then he said he 'd speak to Rob and , whatever got said , it all came true . And no lies told . It was just what Rob promised and what I told Father  --  a smooth ride and fresh air down by the river and Della 's cold chicken , a helpful celebration ( I did leave out the celebration part in all my descriptions , before and after , since excitement is supposed to be ratbanefor me ) . But it was a celebration and as calm as the day . I was weaker than I knew from being cooped-up ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used me all day as if he knew what there was to know about my condition and was gauging every movement , every question he asked , to strengthen not abuse . In fact there were very few questions at all and none about my life . My guess is he 'd heard from Della , through Grainger , some version of the past  --  Della knows all you know , likely more  --  and I hope that he has . The last thing I 'd want is to be deceitful about my life or the little meager offerings I can make to his needs . That 's what we talked about finally , his life . He thinks it has been poor ; it sounds good to me  --  a father that left them when he was a baby , a mother who watched him as little as possible . When he finished his story ( longer than Leviticus and he 's just twenty-one ) and turned to me , expectingan answer , I said , " Is that a complaint or what ? " He thought it over by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll ask you to draw that mountain ; I want it framed near me for the rest of my life ) ; and that gave me a close chance to study him  --  a long oval face with a high clear forehead , great wide cheekbones like wings laid back front a firm inquisitivep178nose , a broad mouth that flares ( almost shocking in a man ) . Brown eyes as I said  --  beautiful but shut to me ; by his choice , I think . Strong coarse brown hair , lightening with the long days of work in the sun  --  his skin of course darkening . ( What good is all that to you , you wonder ?  --  none , I guess . You could not construct him from a ream of words ; but I have no other likeness to send you except all this letter which is testimony to him . You might well find him an ordinary sight . Mother does . ) Anyhow when he had thought , he said , " No I figured you would see . It 's an invitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " though I feared the whole day would collapse right there , and he nearly died laughing . I joined him , confused , but stopped before he did ; and when he recovered he said , " You are cured . Nothing wrong with you . " I said , " I agree . Now answer my question . "  --  " To be good to me , " he said . I 'd been doing that !  --  though it was a relief to have his permission  --  but being me , I just said " Thank you " ( I am bad under pressure as you well know ) . And he left it there . He did n't say " Thank you Yes or No , " but nodded and smiled and ate the last shortleg . So I relaxed too  --  as far as I could with a satisfied heart !  --  and after we had talked on some about his road job ( which he 's flabbergasted to find he enjoys ) and Father 's grand plans for a tourist magnet ( which we both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's time you were home . That was part of my promise . " So home we went and happy it 's been . We have not been off the premises since  --  together , I mean . Rob 's worked , to be sure ; but two of the last four evenings we have sat by ourselves on the sideporch and talked . He has still not asked me an unkind question , and I do n't think he will . With me he seems determined to live in the present , and you 'll know how grand I think that is . It does of course raise thoughts of the future ; but all I can do is hope and be calm , try to get myself into good working-order and accept his simple invitation to be good ( to keep you calm let me just explain that the most touching we 've done so far is his hand now and then to help me through a door ) . He plans to board here another few months , at least till the road pushes so far away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening ( two more of them are staying here now  --  young boys and quiet  --  on Rob 's recommendation , which greatly pleases Father and feeds his hopes ) . Beyond that he says he wo n't think . But you 'll know I do . All I know about love  --  all I know about simply being good to the needy  --  is that such contracts are sworn forever . I 'm nothing if not lasting . Certainly this letter has lasted forever . I beg your pardon . But you helped me so much in those weeks at your home ; and now I 've been silent so long , and apparently ungrateful , that I had to tell you at some full length of the new help , the new chance , that 's been offered to me . I am trying to take it this time , for good . But calmly as I said . Another month of calm enforced by Father  --  another good thing , I begin to suspect.  |p179So  make your plans now to come in late June and really visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a better friend ; by then someone you can confide to , not just listen to day after day . Write me all your news . Warm regards to your parents  --  do n't show this to your Father ( in fact burn it ) , but tell him I am better ! Thanks and love to you , Happy birthday to me , As always , RachelJune 14 , 1925 Dear Niles , Aunt Rena has forwarded your letter ; and I take this first chance , my one day off , to tell you that Yes I 'm alive and all right . Matter of fact , I am also close by . After leaving you in Staunton with the cowchain and slopjars , I wandered a little and drank a lot and wound up begging a job with Lassiter Construction Company . We are building a road going east through the mountains from Goshen to Roller 's Retreat ( remember ? ) , and I 'm not sure if I can wait to get there . I am sure , to tell you the pure-God truth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . I 'm well taken care of on all sides here and the job  --  third foreman in charge of moving rock ( with dynamite ; I learned blasting quick )  --  pays better than I 've ever got before and has the added virtue of wearing me down to a nub every evening . Unfortunately , as various Baptist deacons might say , the nub still works . And the nub is what 's getting all the good care ( not all , but a good part ; one joy at a time though ) . The nub 's care is coming , on the strict Q.T. , from a girl that works at the place I 'm boarding . Snuff-brown , age nineteen ( she thinks ) , the cook and general-help at this place . I 'm whipped a good many nights as I said ; but when I 'm not and can creep out back where she has her room without being seen by the various watches , then it 's all I need ; then it 's perfect proof of what I have told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The world is a doctor if you know who to ask . Otherwise I spend what hours are left  --  oh precious few !  --  being good to another girl . White this time , daughter to the manager of this old dump of a watering hole . Good in her case mainly means listening . She has just turned twenty , been in poor health for years ( just home in fact from a stay at a chest place over near Lynchburg , apparently safe now but weak on her pins ) and talks a good deal ; but tired as I am by the time she gets to me , she does have the power to command attention . My attention anyhow . Partly her looks  --  she is almost as tall as inc and thin , but the main thing about her is hair and eyes . Black horse hair that , old as she is , she stillp180wears long so that , when she starts talking to me at night , it swags round her face and hides her neck like two dense stranglers ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just hangs on the dark and carries her eyes  --  the steady thing . They are dark as her hair and hold dead on me . I am the rescue ; I know that clearly . She has made me that ; chose me from thin air  --  her name is Rachel Hutchins  --  and so far I 've let her and listened as I said . Certainly I 'm flattered and since the " staples , " so to speak , are coming from another quarter ( and no questions asked , no answers expected ) , I seem to be liking her and looking forward to her . She is by the way no fool at all  --  no show-off either but a good tough wit , a hard little scrapper ( if she 's stronger now , it 's her own mind that 's done it  --  her parents would make General Pershing nervous , and her Lynchburg doctor sounds like a loud quack ) ; and most of the talk anyhow concerns your old friend and mine , Rob Mayfield the Second.  --  Who is as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed ( alone ) . If the work eases up in a month or so , maybe I can take a Saturday afternoon off and drive down to meet you in the feedand-seed ; and we could tour the churches of Staunton on Sunday . Will I know you at all ? Do you wear sleeve garters yet ? An isinglass eyeshade ? You wo n't know me . I am handsome again . Keep me posted please ( assuming , that is , that you know something more than the current price of nails ; how 's your own nub , for instance ? ) Have you been home yet ? Any real news from there ? Ever , RobJune 23 , 1925 Dearest Rob , You know me . Others may keep an infinite silence , and God knows I try at appropriate times but finally I burst . So here are the burstings . Very little has changed . You 'd recognize us all if you walked in tonight which of course I frequently pray that you will . Three and a half months is one hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat after twenty-one years . Well , we eat it is all and are grateful , I guess , to be all healthy and shambling along day to day . You 'll know what the news has been since you left  --  barring deaths or the sudden descent of Jesus , you 'll know the news here wherever you go , however long you stay . We are dedicated to the way things are , which you also know . For something to say though , here 's how they are . Father has been stronger with the good warm weather . No hot sieges yet so Sylvie and Eva have managed to get him out in the yard several bright mornings . He can stump along between them and sit in the shade in the old wicker rocker ( but still as a stone ; rocking just sets him wild ) . What most concerns him now is the palm tree . Slick got it back outdoors the same time as Father ; and he likes to watch it and call passers over and tell them its age , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Uncle Deward brought it up in his lap ( a six-inch seedling ) from Gainesville , Florida ; a Christmas gift to Eva just after she was born , well before me ! It is eight feet tall now  --  was when you left  --  and gives every sign of being in the best health of any creature present . Father runs it a close second . Not that anybody else is really down . I have had the eczema all over my hands since right after you left . Has driven me all but crazy this time  --  in fact I ca n't imagine why I have n't gone . Dr. Turner has me wearing thick mittens at night so I wo n't gouge myself all raw in my sleep . Sleep !  --  slim chance . If I 've slept a solid hour in the last four months , it has gone undetected by me at least . Still I trust to recover . When or how is a secret ( can you shed any light ? ) . Eva 's all right  --  busy of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbeknownst to her . I trust you 'll excuse me when I tell you why . Sylvie told me you 'd written , right after she delivered it ( she had been waiting as worried as I ) ; so I did n't say a word but watched Eva closely , from desperatecuriosity to hear about you and also because , as you may not know , letters have been the cause of disaster in this house before . I watched but there was nothing to see , nothing I had n't seen every day of the years since she came back . By suppertime , I was quite upset but held my tongue ; and when Eva came in to get Father 's tray , Sylvie said , " How is Mister Rob getting on ? " Eva turned , as calm as sunrise at sea , and said , " Everybody can rest in peace . He is safe and sound in Goshen , Virginia ; has a job all but promised and sends his love . " Well , I have n't known her all this time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said " Good , good " and let her go on . When she got out of earshot , Sylvie said , " Miss Rena , she lying . That was the biggest letter I ever brought here . " I told her to hush , but I went on watching . Eva sat with Father extra late that night and to my surprise read to him from the Bible  --  Mother 's Bible that she took from your room ( you know roughly how much the Bible means to Eva ) , gentle parts from the prophets , those promises of help that have been inexplicably delayed . When she left him though , I gave her a while ; then went in to her and said , " Is there anything you need me for ? " She smiled and tried to say " Such as what ? " but her tongue seized on her . I had not seen Eva at a loss in something like twenty years ; so I went and touched her , just took her by the wrists and offered to kiss them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I walked her to the bed and sat down beside her , still holding one hand . I did n't speak again . If I 've learned anything in my life it 's to wait . Eva also waited , dry and cold , and finally she looked square at me and said , " I le is trying to finish me . Maybe I should let him . " I just said " Rob ? " She nodded Yes but then said , " Please do n't ask any more . I 'll talk when I can . " I said , " Just this  --  were you truthful ? Is he safe ? " Shep182said , " For now . Yes you can sleep easy . " I said , " Would you like me to sleep in here ? I could make a pallet . " She smiled  --  " No thank you . I am not Mother anyhow . You get your sleep . " Curiously I did . I could barely get through my prayers awake , worn out from waiting ; but I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamt for what I honestly believe is the first time since Mother died . It concerned you and me being chased through snowy woods by men . I was happy all through it and happiest at the end , that I crawled through to safety for both of us . I was bearing you . You were going to be free . So the next morning I was unusually rested , and Eva had managed to seal herself over . She gave no sign of even remembering our previous words ; and I did n't press , warned Sylvie not to . But when more days passed with nothing else from you and Eva never offered me a chance to ask what had struck her so hard , I was forced to act and went for the letter . I have since read it twice ( she keeps it on her bureau , plain to all ) . I ca n't say that much of it was news exactly ( except your movements and the tales of drinking ; you can stop that tomorrow as you say and you must  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kendals but never a drunk , so do n't be the first one ; and even if the May fields are sots back to Noah , you break the chain ) ; so it did n't affect me as heavily as Eva . I also know it was n't meant for me . You are one of the few occasions in my life which I do not regret . I would stand before God Almighty tonight and dare him to name one sin I did you ; one time I failed in the work I saw laid down for me the moment you entered this house , a helpless babe . I confess a billion other grave faults , but in you I succeeded . What failed , Son , was you . Eva wo n't tell you that because she does not see it and because , above all , you love her so and she ca n't risk losing that , however she 's ignored it  --  especially now when the years have left her all but alone and will leave her that soon . But I know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( this is no plea now ; you are too far gone ; there is nothing you could give me now which I could use ; nothing which I could believe in , even ) . I can and will tell you  --  you accept gifts badly . You abuse the generous . Children do that and are pardoned for their youth . You are fully a man now and are not f orgivenandwill not be , not by me or Father ( whose money you 've eaten since before you could stand ) or your own strange mother ( who has loved you , I see now , as best she could in view of her life  --  and of your cold nature ) , not even by Sylvie who has told me more than I wanted to hear . People like you who have won heaven 's grace bear the largest burden of all , I believe ; and bear it you must  --  learn to take the world 's praise , its helpless thanks  --  or spoil in the way you 're spoiling now . You complain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all my admittedly narrow experience recall another human who has been so continuously attcnded . Most men are solitary marchers , by you ; not to speak of women . Leave us then . By all means , go . And for the sake of mercy , stopp183begging your mother for what she does not have to give . For your strange reasons , some of which I grant are no fault of yours , you have made us your poison . Have the sense  --  and simple dignity , Rob  --  to stop licking at us . Find something that is actually food you can eat , that will offer itself ; then eat till its gone . Will it seem crazy of me at the end here to reaffirm what you 've known for years  --  you 're the love of my life ? Simple as that . And I could not be turned around tomorrow  --  too old , too accustomed , nowhere else to go . So you know you are always welcome here . Anything I have said elsewhere above should not be construed as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as you , of one who has at least watched you more steadily these twenty-odd years than any other human breathing air at present . Everybody sends love or would if I asked them . Do n't mention me or any of this in your next to us ; but do write soon with calmer news  --  and remember to include a greeting for Sylvie . She literally pines . She said this week , " This place like a engine without no gas . " I told her , " I did n't know you could drive . "  --  " Ca n't , " she said , " but I sure can ride . " So can I , Rena KendalJuly 4 , 1925 Dear Mr. Forrest , Here is Grainger finally . I guess you think it has been a long time but I have kept busy since I come from the war and have not had other reason to write . Thank you for your letter that got to me in France with promise of help . I planned to accept but went home awhile and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second time and put everybody in misery again like I did before . I was still young then and had high notions . Miss Polly knew that so I guess she excused me in her heart by now . Tell her please that I feel different now and am truly sorry if she is still there nearby to hear you . I learned right much in my own dealings in these past twenty years trying to keep Miss Veenie and fight the war and live with a wife who has gone off now . What I am writing you about though is not me but Rob your boy . He turned up in Bracey three months ago to see Miss Hatt . I guess she told you . Curiosity mostly . He got upset and she asked me to watch him . Was n't much left for me around there and he seem to want me so that landed me with him up here in the high mountains , Goshen . He is buildinga road and I am helping out at the same hotel where he stay and eat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inc much as you did at first , and you know how young he is but here just lately he gone off the track more times than one , drinking heavy and leaning on women , one colored.  |p184Much  as I watch him I ca n't do all , trying to save a little money for my own family all scattered , and you know how much he listen to me , just laugh and leave and do his next wish . Already been in a wreck and a fight , that much known to me , and somebody else bound to get hurt soon , mostly one of his women . What I 'm asking is , you speak to him and find out his trouble and see can you stop him while he still in safety and nobody ruined . Just thought you would want to know this in time , after all this time . Wishing you the best and to see your face , Your old friend , GraingerWrite Rob Mayfield , Hutchins Hotel , Goshen . July 21 , 1925My dear Robinson , I am or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories of me , my images of you are clear and correct despite these years ; and though you will have grown past knowing , I still hope strongly to see you soon and match valued thoughts against the reality worked by time . What this constitutes then is an invitation . Will you come here soon and visit me freely for as long as you wish or your job permits ? I am myself in vacation now , so am mostly open as to time and duty but have learned from my sister of your whereabouts and work . I could come there to you if you wish it at all ( the mountains have always been good to me , and I have not seen them for many years ) ; but my own hope is that you could find time to come here long enough to meet and talk . There 's a great deal to say , which you might care to hear or need to know ; and the house I have is my dead father 's house , the Mayfieldplace . It would be part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause to blame me , Son  --  may I call you that ? It at least is simple fact , never challenged by any . There are also long due debts to me , never paid or acknowledged  --  which I 've long since canceled . If you find it in your heart to discard a past so long and heavy , the lies and failures made mostly by others ( who , whatever their errors , meant you no harm ) , you will find me ready  --  even eager now  --  to begin a friendship , an explanation , a try at amends . Please speak up soon . Yours ever , Forrest Mayfieldcare of The James Normal Institute Richmond , VirginiaP.S . You would have a private room here . No lack of space.  |p185July  29 , 1925My dear Rob , Again I have waited a long time to answer word from you . Waited and listened in the hope I would hear somehow in my empty head a useful answer that would ease my failure and fill your need , punish you and help you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course which you know I seldom take , feeling He has enough to trouble His depths without the annoyance of what little gravel you or I pitch in to stir His shallows . I 'm sorry to say though , nothing has come . You picked the wrong mother . Is that the answer ? Could well be , it strikes me now . In which case , in any case , the next thing to do is have your life . I 've had mine , you see  --  am having it daily and for years to come , I trust  --  and whatever others think about my accidents and choices , I can say in full truth  --  here in roughly midstream  --  that I do not , can not , regret or condemn it . I accuse myself of hurting some feelings , through the ignorance of youth or the need to preserve my sanity and health in the face of another person 's claims on me  --  my mother , your father  --  but the acts of others were theirs not mine ; and I have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have paid however . But I 've had much pleasure , some deep satisfactions  --  I 've given some  --  and hope to have more . The surest blight I could fall to now would be the belief that love was the best thing life could give . After years , and the sights I 've seen and lived , such a fall is unlikely . You suffer that blight though , I honestly believe  --  in relation to me  --  and now Rena tells me you have written to say there 's a girl up there who has cheered you up in recent weeks and that you are considering a life in harness . Consider it hard ; let me urge that on you . You have numerous blessings . I can see them all on you  --  a man , young , bound to no parent ( never likely to be ; I 've told you I 'm safe ) , graced with the open face and manner which the world seeks out and gladly rewards , with a keen able mind ( if you 'll keep it clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own solace alone far more than you 'll guess till you 've yoked it to the mercy of another body 's needs . Forgive me but I 'm telling you the little I know . I 'm not asking here that you care for no one or hoard your gifts so they wither and choke you , just that you give much thought to two things  --  your family history ( mine and your father 's ; every day I breathe I believe more strongly that your home is your fate , all laid down and waiting ) and your own long future with the few little scraps of freedom you possess . I also suggest that your home is here . I can not guess where else it might be . So bait hook and fish for your own life , by all means . But be sure you cast into water not air and that what you catch will be what you can use . We are all right here , blessed by lovely weather  --  bright days but bearable and short cool nights . Father sits out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passers who stop to talk . A day or two ago I left him for a minute ( I mostly sit with him and work at the mending ; I 'm brown as a field hand , which maybe I 'll become ) ; and when I rejoined him , he was entertaining Min Tharrington . She 's back with her diploma . Plans to spend the summer here , then has a job teaching in the country near Raleigh . God help her in that ; she still seems a good deal too gentle for the world , especially children . But then she 's got Tharringtons and Spencers behind her , stretching to Adam ( a lot of grit ! ) ; and maybe they will gather in her craw soon now and toughen her more . Her looks are already settling down  --  a good calm face ; her eyes are relaxing . She was hoping for you though . I knew that at once so spared her the shame of having to ask by telling her you had a laborer 's job , were making good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news or the promise of a visit . She said " Good , good , " though I saw that her view of the summer was marred ; but Father broke in and said " Fool , fool . " No more nor less . Min or I neither one asked Who ? I gave her your address ; she never would have asked . Nobody wants to see you more than I. But that in no way cancels what I 've said all above here about your own life . Trouble with me always is that I mean everything I say  --  and I say so much in various directions . I 'm not to be trusted , I guess is the moral . But I know I am . Believe me and keep me posted . Love , MotherAugust 15 , 1925 Dear Alice , We all got your kind letters of thanks earlier this week . I will let Father and Mother speak for themselves ( Mother anyhow ; Father would n't answer an autographed letter from Jesus , in English ) ; but all I can say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , my dear . For your own good company , a tonic in itself ( you 're the only female I have ever really liked , not to mention trusted  --  you 're the only one worthy who 's crossed my path ) but maybe most of all for your understanding Rob or my view of Rob . The trick about friends , my few friends at least , is to like their friends ; not to finally decide they are fools or crazy to fall for some crook or crank that they cherish . Not to mention require . I think it is now safe to call it that , on both sides . Despite the fact that Rob took to you and arranged those outings , he seemed to me more than a little set back the whole time you were here and , as you noticed , practically invisible the last few days . So much so that , once you were gone , I asked him about it and he said , grinning widely as he always does when serious , " I know it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only person alive who can love two people or more at once . Anybody else who tries i8 dp187cheat ; and I have to leave them , ca n't stand to watch . " I thought and said , " Oh no you are right . Alice is a friend , the first I 've had ; but Alice would be the first to know I would leave her for you if you said the word . " He waited a good while  --  dark on the porch , Mother ten steps away , Della clearing off supper through the window behind us  --  and then he said , " What word would it be ? " I said , " That 's unfortunately for you to discover . I 'll know if I hear it . " He nodded then  --  " All right . Give me time . I 'll rummage around . You may hear it yet . " I said " Please hurry . " He said , " I will . I 'm ready as you . " I asked him " For what ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got to find . " So I sat on and then said " Hurry " again . He said " What 's your rush ? " and I laughed and said , " The little time left ; I may not last ! " He said , " You 'll be living ninety years from now . " I said , " Not long enough by far . " He sat a few minutes more , pleasant quiet ; then got up and whispered he needed a walk . I 'd walk to Asia of course with him , but Mother was still on duty nearby , and I 'm not supposed to breathe deep at night ; so I kept my place and have hardly seen him since ; he has been so busy , day and dark . But late last night he knocked on my door . I was nine-tenths dressed and brushing my hair . I went as I was , barefoot for silence , and opened on him , not certain it was him . I have not seen more than two or three drunks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think he was drunk  --  all oily with sweat , his face unstrung , his eyes skimmed over . He stood straight though and kept his hands down . I said " Good evening . " He said " No , bad ? ' I said " I 'm sorry " but he said , " Do n't be . Just answer one thing ; are you still waiting ? " I said I was ; for a number of things  --  a place in glory chiefly . I honestly thought he was going to strike me . I still think he was . But I quickly said , " Do n't . Please what do you mean ? " He said , " For the word that would bring you to me . " I said , " Oh that . Lord God , I am there . " He said , " No you 're not . But wait till Monday . I may know then . " I was whispering ; he was not  --  I expected Father 's presence momentarily  --  so I did n't risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rob , are you sure you 're all right ? " He said , " Hell no . Are you waiting or not ? " I said I was and he left again . That was Friday night . This is Saturday noon . Somehow I have n't worried but have been mostly calm  --  the surest sign yet that , for whatever reason , I am more nearly back to my best true self than in many dark years . Alice , you bear a part of the blame for that rescue ! ( you and your parents ) ; and whoever commands me in whatever words , whoever I follow or if I stay here and wither alone , I 'll remember that always as a gift barely second to any I 've received ( whatever Rob offers will not be a gift but a serious burden ) . I hope I have given you more than just care . You laughed a lot here ; so I 'll treasure that at least  --  that I caused kind laughter for two good weeks toward the end of a summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me hear by return please more news of your return and , if youp188will , your considered opinion of all you saw here . I need it in writing , so to speak . Renew my grateful greetings to your parents and to anyone left in the Weak-Chest Wards who remembersYour RachelP.S . I had just closed this and was washing my face to walk down to mail it when a knock at my door , which was Grainger , standing . Did I know where Mr. Rob was today ? I said " No why ? " He said , " That 's all right . I just needed to find him " and thanked me and left before I thought i:o quiz him further . So now I 'm afraid I 'm a little shaken . What Grainger does n't know about Rob will be strange . What Grainger does n't know about anything  --  Well , Rob said to wait . Monday 's two days off . I wait , I wait . Ever , R.H.Tm woman who answered Rob 's single knock stood silent , carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice with no trace of question or fear , more nearly the calm spontaneous answer to a question posed long years before , considered ever since . She smiled very slightly and looked maybe thirty  --  Rob judged age poorly like all young men : there were two stripes of gray in auburn hair that seemed fluid with satisfied life of its own , one at each temple . She was middle-sized and met Rob 's eyes deadlevel ( he was one step down ) . " Forrest Mayfield , " he said . " Is he living here ? " " He 's been here twenty-one years , " she said . " But right this minute he has stepped out to buy him a black shoelace . " She touched the back of her own neck gently ; she liked herself . Rob scrubbed his chin with the heel of his left hand . He said , " I 'm sorry to look so scrappy . " He pointed to his muddy car at the curb . " But I drove through the night from back in the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mend . You can wash . You can use his razor . " But she stood in the door still , not waving him in . " I 'm Rob Mayfield . " " The Second , " she said . " I was figuring that . " She touched both eyes . " I 'm not a big reader , but I 've trained my eyes fairly well through the years . " She looked on , still standing , as if there were more than a name to figure , a face to see . " I 'm your father 's help . " " I heard that , " he said . " Who from ? " " Aunt Ilatt. "  | " What word did she use ? " Rob thought . " Help , I think  --  that you 'd helped him a lot . " She nodded . " That was kind . It 's been my wish anyhow , God knows . He needed it . I am Margaret Jane Drewry . " She stepped back , smiling again . " Come in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . The back of the hall , a wide door , was open ; and the clear sun of early afternoon boiled slowly in the space , on clean cream walls hung with wide brown photos of ancient Rome in dark oak frames  --  The Temple of Virile Fortune , of the Magna Mater , of Venus Genetrix . Rob passed them , not looking , aiming only toward the woman who waited near the end by another open door ( every school he had known owned similar sets , supremely unnoticed except by the spinsters who now and then pointed to one with startling passion ) . But she said , " Those were left to your father last year by an old-maid teacher that believed in him . I think she was hoping to drive him back to Latin . " So Rob paused and stared at the Virile Fortune , glum tan rubble . " I see why he left . " Then he faced her . " Did he leave ? " " No , " she said quickly . " Oh no he was left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bell with the force of her peal . He smiled . " I just meant Latin , " he said and gestured to the pictures . She nodded , relieved . " He had to leave that . It 's a colored school  --  teaching them how to live : machine work and all . He teaches just reading and a few little poems  --  John Greenleaf Whittier , all they can take . " " Well , I 'm sorry , " Rob said . Quick and urgent again , she said " Do n't be " ; then stopped herself and deeply blushed  --  embarrassed revelation  --  then recovered conviction . " He 's happy , I mean . " Rob said , " I 'm glad . Hatt said to thank you . " She stood still and looked down , listening to that , cradling it side to side in her mind , one spoon of water on a parching tongue . Then she swallowed it slowly ; and when she looked up , she said , " Wait for him in here . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd made her forget that he needed to wash ; he would not tell her now  --  but before he had walked three steps toward the light , she said , " If you sit in that black leather chair and lie back and rest , I 'll cone in and give you a painless shave and never even interrupt your pleasant dreams . " Rob nodded and went on , accepting her offer , and not only rested but slept  --  no dreams . Too tired for dreams . He had driven all night and half of today , starting in bad shape and worsening steadily . The sights and messages of recent days had mountedp190and pressed ; and he 'd started drinking at work on Friday  --  his first turn to drink , with serious intent , since the bout in Bracey with his Aunt Hatt and Grainger ( the other times had served the purpose of fun , nights with his work-mates ; so he told himself ) . He thought he had got through till quittingtime without his boss 's notice ; but when he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Mayfield , are you coming down sick ? " There was nobody near and Mr. Lassiter had seemed to like him since the day he 'd started ; so Rob said , " Could be . I 've been under pressure . " Mr. Lassiter said " The Hutchins girl ? " Rob had said " No sir , home " ; and Mr. Lassiter said , " Take till Monday morning and get the pressure off . If you are n't here Monday morning fit to work at six , I 'll hire a new man . " Rob had thanked him and passed up a ride back to town on the little gangtruck , saying honestly he felt like taking a walk . There had been a lot of laughter  --  who was waiting for him where ? would she take him all dusty as he was , unshaved ? But they 'd gone off without him , and he 'd walked on behind . The walk was five miles , some three hours long since he stopped several times to suck on his bottle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white river in shades of dying light . When he 'd got near the hotel , it was well past nine  --  supper over and cleared  --  so he 'd walked a long arc and approached from the back in hopes of finding either Grainger or Della off-duty in their quarters . Grainger had gone off with Mr. Hutchins to talk to a carpenter back on the mountain about rebuilding the springhouse cheap ; but Della was sitting barefoot in the dark at the end of her cot , singing hymns to herself . He had walked in on her in total silence and waited till she said , " You early . What you mean ? " He had said , " I mean I am in bad trouble . "  --  " What you want me to do ? " ( she had said it gently , an offer not a spurning ) ; so to give her a task , to give himself a little more quiet time , he asked her to go back and pack his dinner pail  --  he was taking a trip . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He had said , " I 'm thinking . Just get me some dinner " ( no trip had crossed his mind till then ) . She had smelled his harsh breath , known food was the last thing he really wanted but had gone on and rummaged by a single candle to find him enough food to keep him alive ; then had come back and , finding him waiting in her chair , had said , " Here it is but you leaving here stinking . " Rob had said , " I 'll be crossing a number of rivers . I can wash  --  Hell , drown . " She had said , " I got all your pressing right here " ( she washed his work clothes ) , so he 'd let her find him a clean shirt and pants ; and then he 'd turned and left without another word , though he 'd laid a silver dollar on her bureau as he passed . He 'd stowed the food and clothes on the seat of the car , checked the tool box for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dark way round to crank the engine . IIe 'd seen Rachel 's light and , not really waiting a nunnent to think , had climbed the stairs top191her  --  unheard by anyone  --  and made his vague promise with no conscious prior intention behind him , no serious pledge . Then he 'd driven away and run all night over miserable roads  --  down the mountains , fording creeks that were swollen to torrents , stopping twice for punctures , and one time to contemplate his death . He had brought himself to that , let himself be brought . He was in grave earnest fifty miles west of Richmond , the last of the hills above the James River , eight in the morning . He had seen from the road that the hill made a clean hundred-foot drop to water , sufficient wet rocks ; so he 'd pulled over there and stopped the car , thinking , " Rest your eyes for a little anyhow and maybe end it now  --  the whole damn relay race you 've been in for twenty-one years , no choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the dead or the useless and no one to take it . " He had sat on a flat rock the size of a pillow and watched the moiling water for ten full minutes , not thinking especially but listening in calm pain to all that his body or mind volunteered , neither news nor hope . And his head was clear , his body cleaned out . He had not had a drink since leaving Goshen or eaten the dinner . His access to liquor was still in his own grip . What he 'd told his mother in the spring held true  --  he could stop it at will ; it was not yet a necessary substance of his blood but an easy comfort . By the river , in slant early Saturday light , the question had come to : what thing to stop , of the stoppable things ? Then he 'd heard from far down young high voices and hunted till he saw two boys , ten or twelve , on the opposite bank with a single rifle . They quieted soon and studied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own further lives . Rob had strained to find it with them ; feared he 'd found it before them  --  a snapping turtle the size of a galvanized tub treadingcalmly in a still center pool , a great floating melon , a gray precursor who fiercely promised to survive brief man if granted this space ( Rob felt that , never brought it to conscious thought ; like men of any age , much less of his youth and degree of training , Rob thought very little ) . Then the younger boy had seen it and yelled " Yonder , yonder ! " and the older boy had shot , reloaded , shot  --  four quick times . His aim had seemed fine ; the turtle had sunk ( dead , hurt , or fleeing ) ; both boys had sat down then and waited for the river to offer up news of death or another escape . Rob had said to himself with no further waiting , " I will give them something "  --  the sight of his body in air , a sure end . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all others , the job at hand  --  " I can show them what they 've done " ( intending by them , at first , ranks of people from his parents forward but finally these boys ) . " They need me at least , my message to them . " He had stood up slowly so as not to draw their gaze too soon and had gone to the car to unload his pockets of his wages and the case with the porcelain which had borne the picture of his mother , now canceled . Asp192he 'd bent above the seat , he had smelled the food ripening in the dinner pail and had known he was hungry , not a solid bite swallowed in twenty hours . He would eat something first , fall better for the breakfast , leave the empty pail . The boys below would wait , showed no sign of leaving ; and word would reach Della that at least he 'd finished what she 'd bothered to fix : that much of a message to one person likely to regret his leaving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd given him nothing . Nothing to Grainger . So he 'd gone to the rock again and sat and eaten two pieces of chicken and two cold biscuits ; and when he 'd reached again for maybe something sweet , had found not a layer of slick waxed paper but a folded page from a cheap school tablet . He 'd opened it and seen , sprawled in dim pencil letters , " Rob , hoping you like this stuff from Della , think about Della in the city , keep smiling , so long for now . " Rob had wadded it tightly and flung it toward the river and had noticed then that the boys were gone , no word from the snapper . Then he 'd eaten the remains of the food  --  wilted celery , good pound cake  --  and gone to the car and in broad daylight changed his filthy clothes ; then had driven on to Richmond , an arbitrary goal . WHEN Polly had shaved him and dried his face , she saw he was dozing ; so she tried to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes closed , " You going far ? " " The cookstove , " she said , half-whispering , "  --  twenty feet from here . Dinner 's at one . Speak if you need me . " Rob said " Thank you , ma 'm . " She stood and waited ; then she said it full voice  --  " I 'm just Polly Drewry . Call me Polly please . " Rob still did not look but he nodded . " All right . " Then a force in her  --  held twenty years by locks of gratitude , safety , steady reward  --  rocked ; then spilled . She came back a step toward Rob and said , " You 've come for yourself , just yourself ? Is that it ? " Rob looked . She was older by ten years or so . IIer skin had thinned down and paled in these minutes . She was on some cliff of her own , alone . He smiled and whispered as if she were the sleeper , " Oh yes ma 'm , for me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She also smiled but could not rush the fullness and calm to her face . Her top teeth showed through the paper of her lip , and she did not risk another speech till the door . There she stopped and said it again , not turning , " Say Polly please . " Then she left and shut the door firmly behind her.  |p193Rob  said " Polly " once aloud and tried to settle back to rest , his exhaustion so great that he did not object to the thought of being found asleep and helpless by a father he had not seen for twenty years , of whom he had no physical picture or knowledge of intent . He slept for an hour in the room that offered no threat to his peace , though after forty minutes the door opened quietly and Forrest stood silent on the sill looking in . When Rob slept on , Forrest stepped forward to him and waited four feet from the chair , looking down ; then when that did n't stir him , Forrest went to his own desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face-down and went out . It was Polly who woke him . She softly whistled a two-note phrase as introduction , more wind than music ; then she said " Dinner please . " Rob had gone deeper down than a casual nap , and he came up slowly against his mind 's will . ' When his eyes broke open , they were fixed on the room not on Polly at the door ; and since he did not know either at first , he studied the room before facing her  --  one wall of books , lined square and neat , faded and used ; three bare cream walls ( a fireplace in one with a plain brown mantel , its shelf populated with souvenirs ; in another , two windows and between them a desk , papers laid on its top at strict right angles ) . Rob was still unconfirmed in his whereabouts , still half-asleep . He turned to the woman . " I know you are tired , " she said , " but it 's ready . " Rob stood . She stepped aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light hall again , he looked back to her , awaiting guidance . So she said " Just here , " and walked on before him through an oppositedoor by the picture of The Altar of Augustan Peace . Rob touched his uncombed head with both flat palms ; then followed her in  --  another light room , a small round table set plentifully . A man on the far side , standing , turned to Rob . A sizable wait . She said , " Take the seat by Mr. Mayfield . There . " The man said " Robinson . Please " and bowed slightly . There were three places laid . Forrest stood by the farthest one , near the window ; and though his face and voice were pleasant , he did not move forward to greet Rob directly . So Rob said " Thank you , sir " and aimed for the middle chair , four feet from his father 's . After two steps he thought , " I am on the bottom of the James after all " ; he seemed to be struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . He stopped short of goal and said , " Excuse inc . I 'm dirty from work . I came here from work . " I le looked round for Polly to mention the shave . She was gone , just his father.  |p194Forrest  said , " I 'll take that as a compliment then . " " How so ? " Rob said . Forrest smiled . " That you hurried . " It seemed necessary here to tell pure truth  --  new room , new chance . Rob also smiled , a hard expense . " Ran , " he said , "  --  more from than to . " Forrest waited as if he were also submerged and must turn dim echoes into usable words ; then he actually laughed . " That 's the purpose of legs . " He stepped to the middle chair and offered it to Rob . " They 've run you to this . " Then he turned to the open door on his right . " Polly , food . We 're sinking . " " Rescue , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and steaming . Rob found he could cross the rest of the space . THEY had eaten calmly with sparse but easy talk  --  Rob 's trip , his job , the quality of the day after undue rains . Any silence that had threatened had been promptly filled by Polly , not with chatter but funny memories  --  a recent letter from her aging father on his year-long attempt to sell his museum to the federal government , then the state of Virginia , then ( rejectedby those ) to the other Confederate States in order of secession till finally he had given it to a Baptist boy 's school in north Alabama and wound up paying for the crating and freight , and no invitation to come and caretake it  --  which had been half his plan . When she 'd brought them the hot rice pudding though , she 'd left  --  pleading work upstairs  --  and Forrest had said in the first moment 's quiet , " One thing first : will you spend the night ? " Rob had said " Yes " at once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to continue your nap now , wo n't you ? We 'll have all evening to talk , when you 're rested . " Rob had thought , " Maybe my main trouble is I 'm tired . " He had said , " Yes sir . I am no good now , the shape I 'm in . " So Forrest had led him to the study again , a cot draped fully in a paisley shawl ; and said , " I have got to go to school for a while . Polly will be here if you need help . Meanwhile you can die-to-the-world in peace . " Then he 'd shut him in ; and for a second time , the room gave Rob an oblivion as simple as any in a cradle , as bare of demanding memory or image , as untouched by knives of past or present , the future blank . He woke in the light of late afternoon on his back , eyes open on the high wide ceiling . Its unbroken stretch seemed an emblem , an earnest , ofp195plainer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  with no threat of veto or external change  --  a life he could walk through with pleasure and generosity , not only having skills and gifts to give but easily finding the hands to receive them , hands behind which would lie faces he could honor , faces he would need . He began , as he had so often when a boy on summer morningsbefore the house woke , to write with his mind on the patient plaster surface  --  imaginary words inscribed by his eyes but clear and straight in his customary script : Robinson Mayfield , twenty-one years old ; a one-story home under old oak trees never struck by lightning , Sylvie in the kitchen , three miles in the country from a crossroads town where his two parents live in their own large house which he and his older brother and sister visit on Sundays and holidays for dinner ; a wife two years his junior , dark-haired and a whole head shorter when standing before him , though her eyes greet his eyes four inches away as she turns each morning in early light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret leisure of their own house and time , no further drafts on his energy except some job that will yield to the arcs his body must make as it swings toward happiness and finally rest . Rob saw it , as legible as Moses ' law ; held it for long healing moments there above him . No visible reason why he could n't enact it , obey its claims . He heard a dry rustling ; his eyes cut left . His father was seated at the desk also writing ( having come back from school at four o'clock and waited awhile for sounds from Rob , then entered to work beside him in silence ) . He had not seen that the boy was now conscious . So Rob watched him secretly  --  at first as an image , a proximate stranger , a man maybe fifty whose skull had refused to acknowledge time . No skin-slides or ruts at the jaw or neck , not a cell of fat to conspire with the downward haul of the earth . The one dark eye which was visible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been dimmed by the sights but fueled , made hungrier minute by minute yet fed . There was none of the low wail of vacancy in him  --  the woman 's assertion of grievance , desertion , offense endured , deliverance begged . Rob then looked in the effort to settle some blame on the man for his own stagnant misery , encirclement . He was not by nature an accuser or a judge ; but here in this room after so much time , he saw that his life had been made after all ; that one of the makers was near him now , revealed in the total shape of his guilt  --  a young girl abandoned , an infant boy , thrust back to a nest which had proved a cage , a magnet attracting to its famished self all human impulse before it could rush to other poles . Rob actually narrowed his eyes , crouched them inward to draw from the face ten feet away a silent acknowledgment of damage done , penalties owed , fines offered ( the man had spoken first and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Forrest or from Rob toward him . No charge , no conviction.  |p196Then  he tried affection . Would it have been good as a young boy to wake from hot summer naps on musty sofas to find this man in the same room working , light on this same face ( but younger , gentler , still useful for years ) ? Rob relaxed his eyes , the cords of his own face , and waited whole minutes . Nothing again . He had never wanted this man , could not now , would not ever . He spoke to be speaking , no intent but sound . " This is a pretty good house you 've got " ( he 'd forgot Forrest saying it would be his in time ) . If Forrest was startled , he gave no sign . He answered while writing a final phrase  --  " For ninety years old , it 's doing all right . Your great-grandfather , who was Forrest before me , built it hand-over-hand  --  just himself and two slaves  --  in 1835 . A gift for his bride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dry house , he found one quick  --  Amelia Collins , somewhat his inferior . They moved in in ' 36  --  sold one slave , both were single men  --  and had my father ( your grandfather Rob ) in March ' 39 . Then old Forrest fell dead  --  a master carpenter , on a roof  --  and she lived on here , a seamstress and candy-maker , sixty some years : most of them alone . Kept the Yankees out though , kept the roof and walls standing when most of Richmond fell . Just pure force of will ; she would n't be buried . " Rob said " Did you know her ? " " I did n't , no , I 'm sorry to say . In the years my own father lived with us , she would n't speak to him , would n't meet his wife , would n't even so much as acknowledge our births  --  mine and Hatt 's . " Rob said " He had left her . " It was not a question . " That may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I thought she was dead . But then I was five years old when he vanished , just saw him one more day before he died . He explained it to Polly . He came back and lived here with her , you see  --  his mother Amelia till she died in her eighties . He went shortly after . " Rob passed up the questions of what explanation and why to Polly . He looked round the space again . " Whose room was this ? " Forrest thought awhile . " Grainger 's , " he said . " That 's where I come in . Before that , I think it was some kind of pantry . When my father died it was cram-full of junk . Then when I moved here , we cleared it for Grainger . He slept where you are  --  why the cot 's so small : he left at thirteen . " Rob nodded but had no question to ask . His father said " How is he ? " " Waiting , " Rob said . " For what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Philadelphia , sucking money like a funnel . " Forrest said , " Oh no ; on us , on us . IIe is waiting on us , the Mayfields , his people . You know who he is ? " Rob said , " IIe told me ; old Rob 's grandson . "  |p197Forrest  said , " Apparently . No reason to doubt it . No doubt we 've got kin , all shades and grades , scattered broadcast all along the eastern seaboard ; my father needed frequent company . " He smiled . Rob responded . " I suspected that ; may run in the family . " Still smiling , Forrest said " It skipped a generation . " Rob showed pleasant doubt . Forrest shrugged . " Not entirely . " He paused long enough to reassume seriousness . " What else has he told you ?  --  Grainger , I mean . " " That you taught him a lot ; that he lived with you as long as he could ; that then he went back to Bracey , kept his old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked him to come on here to school but he found a girl , the Gracie I mentioned . " Forrest said , " Go back . Did he say why he left me ? " His face showed the matter was calmly urgent . Rob worked to recall . " No sir , he did n't ; just why he did n't come here to school from the war . " Forrest said " The girl . " Rob said , " Well , her and the fact you did n't write to him till the war was over . He had missed hearing from you . " Forrest shook his head once . " He had n't heard from me in thirteen years . He left me , you see . Most people have . I had offered him a life well past his own hopes . But he ran back to Bracey ; should have gone to Maine at least . " Rob saw he was in the presence of a pain which had not yet decided it could bear exploration . He said to himself " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak but sat upright to the edge of the cot , then leaned against the wall . Forrest said " You 've seen Bracey . " " Through something of a haze as you probably heard ; but yes sir , I have . " " How was my sister ? " Rob said , " Friendly but baffled a little " ; he meant by his visit , his own behavior . His father said " Crazy . Solitary desolation . " " You left her , " Rob said . " Everybody did . It was leave her or be her , turn into her ghost . She was far too kind , our mother 's child . I had to work , you see  --  work or strangle in misery  --  and the work was here . " Rob said , " I thought you were teaching in Bracey . Grainger showed me your little private house on the hill , where the man shot himself . " Forrest studied the boy for malice , found none  --  if anything , a courteous puzzlement : He 's accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he owes me attention now . Forrest said , " Awhile back , you spoke of running . " He stopped at that . Rub nodded . " Yes sir , running from not to . "  |p198Forrest  smiled . " I was doing both , " he said , " twice as hard as you and some years older . " " The to part was just teaching poems to Negroes ? " Anger stood up in Forrest 's throat  --  he thought it was anger and felt he must down it ; but waiting , he knew it was memory . " I forgot your mother was a Kendal , " he said , "  --  Kendal and Watson , mean streaks on both sides . " Then he felt he had no right to blame , having passed on the Mayfield and Goodwin hungers ( the victim 's eyes ) but not stayed around to help forge the polar strains into one working man , both true and merciful . Yet he begged no pardon . He said in his normal voice , " The to part was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd seen that and would understand , thought you were old enough to honor that . " " I am , " Rob said . But Forrest had more . " I 've had two accounts of your own recent troubles  --  troubles or mischief : please help me distinguish . Hatt sent a rather high-strung tale of your visit ; and Grainger broke a fifteen-year-long silence and swallowed much pride to write me that you had gone past him and his power to help . Do n't tell him I told you ; he 's a generous heart and acts by his lights , no easy lights to follow ; but he 's why I spoke up and asked you here . Nobody 's said what your trouble is . I thought I would show you what I had to give though and hope that would help . " Rob thought and then smiled . " The dinner was good ; the nap was needed . " Forrest said , " I meant a good deal more than that . " " I 'm sorry , " Rob said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " You 've seen it , the best part anyhow  --  she shaved you and fed you . The other parts are this house , a good still place , and the work I do both here and at school . " Rob said , " Sir , pardon me . I am half-Kendal ( you chose a Kendal , no fault of mine ) ; and I can be hard  --  you 're not the first human to tell me that  --  but I do n't mean to be one thing more than honest in saying : how on God 's earth can you help me by showing me pictures from your life here when you barely know more of me than my name ? You do n't even know what 's troubling me , what one damned day of my life is like . " Forrest nodded . " I 'm free . I 'm ready to hear . " Rob waited in silence for a reason to tell it , a reason for being here at all . It came  --  There is nobody else to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the calm not to panic , not to use it against me , or the good sense to guess what festers all in it , the guts to pick it out  --  so he said , " I wake up at six in the morning to a bell that sounds like Jesus at Judgment . I go to my wash bowl and clear up my eyes and brush my teeth . Then I lie back down and say my prayers ; I like to be halfway clean for that . I just say the names of the ones I love or am worried about and " Thy will be done . ' Then I may have a little quick fun with my body : you asked for this now ;  |p199and  you 're getting it straight ( not every morning certainly  --  sometimes I 've had that seen to otherwise the previous night  --  but morning is of course when I 'm not worn out ) . Then I put on my trousers and my undershirt and go downstairs to the hotel kitchen  --  I live in a rundown springs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shave on the backporch and look at the mountain standing up there before me . I 'm not that much of a nature lover , but a full-sized mountain with a falls and laurel does help me get started if I wake up low . Then I put on my shirt which I bring down with me and sit at a table on the same long porch and eat a big breakfast cooked by that same girl . There are other people present  --  other men on the crew , the hotel owner ( checking up on the portions , though he never says Stop ' ) , and Grainger waiting table  --  but I say very little that early in the day : my head 's still frozen . And nobody there 's got a claim on me anyhow . Grainger maybe ; I 'm friendly to him . By the time we are finished , Grainger 's brought out our dinners all packed in buckets by the cook ( ten cents ) ; and we head out to the crossroads and wait a few minutes for the crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other half is evening . The eleven hours in between , I widen the old road down through the pass , eastward toward money  --  slowest work known and dangerous and dirty but it pays fairly well , and I 've learned it fast . Then evening as I said . It generally comes . " Forrest said , " Wait . Do you like the work ? " Rob thought it half-through and laughed . " Would n't everybody like to blow up rocks ? Of course the novelty wears off . " He waited . " No sir , like is not part of it . It 's what I 'm doing to wear me out till something harder comes ; and you see , I 'm young with a good deal of strength ; so it does n't even tire me more than half of the time . " He laughed again ; he had talked himself through another narrow passage  --  his father 's face agreed . " I get to the hotel and wash off the dust and go downstairs at just about dark and eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . Me and two Roberts boys from Jennings ' Ordinary who work on the crew are the only three regular paying guests , plus a dogeared drummer every week or so ; so they hold supper for us , and we all eat together  --  Mr. and Mrs. Iutchins and Rachel their daughter , the Roberts boys , me , and Grainger serving every good thing Della cooks ( she 's the girl I mentioned  --  till Grainger came , the only black face in sight around there ) . That 's generally pleasant . Mr. Hutchins has some pretty grand ideas about the amount of money that 's going to stream toward him down our new road  --  he 's sixty , some and remembers the time when his mother had twenty guests a night from May through August  --  so he 's got Grainger also working on repairs : some whitewashing , changing a board here and there . His main aim now is to get the spring covered , new shingles on the springhousc , lattice on the sides . But far as I 'm concerned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Rachel , who has not been well ; but he 's right to trust me . I 've been decentp200to her , clean as a pin . Most evenings after supper I sit down with Rachel on the dark sideporch . It helps her to talk  --  she talks , I listen . She 's been a nervous girl all her life it seems , which is twenty years ; but her father decided after this past Christmas that she had T. B. or the warning signs and sent her off to some little chest place in Lynchburg , her mother in tow . She 's strengthening now and talks a lot about her future which I 'm afraid she thinks means me ; she counts on me , I think . I 've tried not to fail her so far as I 'm able  --  which has n't been easy , considering that two or three nights a week , once Rachel has gone upstairs to bed ( at ten , Father 's orders ) , I get to stroll out and visit the colored : Grainger if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns in soon as he 's finished supper dishes , but mostly Della . She 's younger than Grainger , younger than me , and a restless sleeper ; so I pay her little calls , and she lets me in . " Forrest said , " That 's being friendly to Grainger ? " He smiled slightly , falsely , so as not to stop Rob . Rob nodded at once . " No doubt about it . I waited till I saw he had passed up the chance , even asked him about it before I moved . I 'm keeping her out of his way , you see , so he can go on waiting Gracie in peace . " Forrest said , " I told you what he 's waiting for " ; but he motioned Rob on . " If Grainger is waiting on me , you mean , to bring him happiness from God on a tray , he 's simpler than he looks . I let him trail me , I listen to him talk ( he 'll talk you dead if you just sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no intention of visiting Della in the same building with him ; then I lived my life . I enjoy human company ; I take it when offered if it warms my eye and comes bearing no due-bills or claims . " Rob had stumbled , in that , on a door he had really not known to exist ; a door concealed near the pit of his throat  --  he felt it now as keenly as though it had locus and heft and hinges . It opened inward on a small low room , white , utterly bare . He stared at the sight and said , " Father , please listen . I was twenty-one years old five months ago . That may seem the wink of an eye to you ; it has been my life . And if you 've sat here those twenty-one years , eating good hot meals from a white housekeeper and thinking your son down in Fontaine , N. C. was laughing non-stop at his little happy life , I can tell you he was n't . Right now , today , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , sir . I was raised in her spare time by my Aunt Rena and black lonesome Sylvie while my own mother , that I loved like the world , was tending her father who was due to die but is still to my knowledge as healthy as most fieldhands at harvest , barring strokes and pain ( I mean he wo n't die ) . " Forrest said , " Most mothers have to nurse somebody  --  you never had to fight a brother or sister  --  but a day 's a long time , lot of chances in a day . I 'm sure Eva gave you more than you grant . " " She did n't , " Rob said . " What did you want ? " " What you wanted , 1 guess . "  | " But she married me . " " And bore me all bloody . " Rob had said that quietly , no trace of pride or pity . Then he stared at the small green rug at his feet and scuffed it slowly . ' When he looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silent still radiance which he 'd previously shown to only three people  --  Rena , Min Tharrington , Rachel Hutchins . Helpless he turned to his father with it now , not knowing it had passed through his father to him from vanished ranks of Mayfields . Forrest failed at first to see it . He said , " She never wanted either one of us  --  me because I was me , you because you were mine . You are dreadfullymine , my father 's and mine  --  the way we were at least . Now you have come this long way to show me . I 'm grateful . " Forrest stopped as if at an end . He thought he had finished , seen the sight to be seen . But the boy held still ; so he looked on at him and saw him at last , grand in his face as the young Alexander horned like Ammon , in all his form like Aeneas at Carthage ( ante alios pulcherrimus omnis , before all others most beautiful ) ; and made by Forrest , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an aging boy , corrosive hungers but potent and eating at this boy now . Forrest leaned out and pled in a gentle whisper , " Oh Jesus , Son , change . Change now while you can . Find someone to help you and start your life . " " Yes sir , " Rob said and intended to obey , ignoring the live working presence of Eva in all his fibers ( as Forrest had forgot it through happiness and years ) . THAT evening when she 'd fed them a second time and seen them rush off in Rob 's car so Forrest could show him the school while daylight lasted and then to the last night of Pola Negri in Shadows of Paris , Polly put fresh sheets on the study cot and turned in early , puzzled by tiredness ( she was seldom tired ) , and slept at once . No fear or grudge of which she would have spoken or privately thought  --  awake by day . In her sleep she walked through a large busy town , strange from the first and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd had , and was finally forced to stop one stranger after another and ask directions to the Drewrys ' , her father 's . She was clearly herself , a full-grown woman with her present skills and knowledge , not a child or senile ; but the strangers all treated her as shameful , repulsive . All of them were men , no woman in sight , and would either turn from her in scorning silence or give her some scrap of direction so brief as to lead her farther into loss and confusion . She knew less of where she was with every step till she 'd come to the gloomy heart of the town where dark old houses of the poor leanedp202together , propping one another in a useless struggle against decay . She stood at the junction of two narrow streets in stinking mud and was desperate . A Negro boy came from an opposite alley , walked too close on her , and stopped and said , " You never going to find it . You want me to show you ? " She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She thought , " At least he is not shamed by me , " though her own hot wrist ( which he ringed with dry fingers ) was pained by his touch . He led her a long way till she understood that where she had met him had been no heart of misery but a limb , a pale extremity . They walked through streets past houses so poor she could feel their odor , the scent of offense , like a scalding poultice across her mouth and eyes . Then she realized that the boy had left her , vanished in silence ; but she found that she now knew her way somehow  --  the Negro 's grip had conveyed it like grease through her skin . She went another fifty feet and stopped at a house right down in the street , no sidewalk or steps . She knew she was there . Dry curls of the dark brown paint on the door fell at her knock , and more as it opened . An old woman  --  white , straight , clean for the place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long face strong as a flagstone slab , as blank and unknowing . Polly said , " Where is Mr. Drewry please ? " The old woman dried both hands on her worn skirt , working to recall . At last her voice was older than her face  --  " With Jesus in Glory , I hope , but dead . " Polly said , " I have come here to stay with him . " The old woman stood on , now blocking the door . Polly said , " I 'm his daughter . He expected me . " The old woman nodded . " No he did n't , " she said , " and I know who you are . You are Margaret Jane . But you ca n't stay here ; the young man is here . " Polly looked past the woman and could see in the dark room a single man , darkhaired , seated at a table examining his hands as if they were one thing in all this filth that bore close study , might yet prove precious . He did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old woman said , " You can stand in this room a minute and rest " ; and Polly saw that the woman was her mother , secretly survived but ancient and ruined . Undoubtedly her . Polly took the offer , entered and stood one stifling minute in the room crammed with heat , the odor of rancid lard in the walls ; then was led out silently and shut in the street . She was wakened by the front door opening downstairs . She half-sat up and  --  stunned , pulling for breath  --  listened for voices : Forrest 's first , low , " I 'll see you to bed and leave you to sleep ; I know you 're exhausted " ; then Rob 's young and clear , " No sir . I could talk if you want to talk . " Their steps down the hall to Grainger 's old room , its door shut behind them , their laughter and talk stripped of words by the thick walls , the oak door , but not of their meaning . Their glad relay of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame , announcement of desertion . Her life discarded . She lay back and waited in thick hot darkness for the sound of Forrest leaving , coining upstairs to bed . After nearly two hours by the chime of thep203station clock , a half-mile away , she heard him on the stairs  --  quiet not to wake her . He passed her open door ( no pause , no audible thought ) ; went on to his own room , poured a glass of stale water , drank it , undressed , breathed the regular rhythms of sleep at once . The downstairs was silent . Polly said to herself , " Sleep , goose . Just a dream . " And later she slept , though a wading in shallows , no cleansing fall . She had had no previous such dream or threat in the thirty-nine years since killing her mother . WHEN Forrest had left him , Rob did not try to sleep . His afternoon nap and the unexpected curious excitements of the trip , transfusions of life , had him wide awake and more nearly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time since March  --  the chance at least of continuance and change , departure from childhood . So he stripped to his underpants and studied the room , books first since books were the main thing in sight . He passed them quickly . Almost half were in Latin or Greek , and the half in English was mostly verse . Few stories , no accounts of animals or travels , no life of Jesus telling more than the Gospels , no medical texts of the sort he had always hoped to find and knew to exist  --  his body 's resources all clearly explained , his needs both acknowledged and briskly forgiven , calm guidancegiven to chances he had never yet taken ( or heard of ) for sanity and pleasure . Then he went to the mantel where he 'd seen what he took to be souvenirs  --  the cast dried skin of a red rat snake , which Rob could not touch ; a small polished disc of petrified wood ; the skull of a bird ( the size of a bird egg and paper-thin but intricate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coin ( some fat man 's profile  --  a Caesar , Rob guessed ) ; a small gold medal on a faded ribbon ( The Orator 's Medal to Forrest Mayfield , April 1887  --  Vox Humana , Vox Divina ) ; and two rough carvings the size of a hand in soft pinebark , old and polished by touch . Rob reached for one and remembered at once his own crude carvings at six or eight , when a whole afternoon spent carving some horse or bird or girl was not so much an effort at skill as at simple courage , the struggle to fight down the scary feel of pinebark ; the dry rind of trees whose hearts were streaming rosin , skin scaly as a lizard 's and slightly feverish . A little square man  --  bullet head , gouged eyes , club-footed , legs wide . Down the mnan 's right leg hung the equally rough indication of genitals . For no reason known to him , other than the need to conquer fear , Rob cradled the man in his large right hand and stroked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's own polish , the hardness of his hands after months on the road . He put him down gently beside his mate , a breasted woman , and stood a niomcnt thinking . He would write his postcards ( they had stopped at a drugstore beforep204the picture , and he 'd bought three cards of the Richmond sights )  --  to Della and Sylvie , no thought of consequences for them or himself , only of their pleasure in a distant thought . He would see Della well before the card could reach her , but he owed her that much . Sylvie would use hers as she saw fit , secret or public ; there was no predicting ( she would sometimes keep letters days or weeks till she found some person she could trust to read them to her ) . He went to the desk where he 'd laid them and sat , expecting to find a pen or indelible pencil at least . None in sight , only mail of his father 's and the stack of school papers on which his father had worked that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simpkin , Last Composition , My Thought Upon taus Deo ' by Whittier , " This poem says Mr. Whittier is glad to hear about the freedom . He is living up north and word come to him . He think about God first thing in Latin . " Rob put it back thinking that , so far at least , it matched his own Last Composition except for the errors which his father had patiently corrected in red ( Aunt Rena 'd checked all Rob 's work and saved him often ) ; but who could spend a life knocking s 's off the verbs of future masons , farmers ; stuffing words into mouths incapable of holding them ? ( Hungry for a damned sight more than words ) . Rob remembered what his father had said of Aunt Hatt  --  " Crazy : loss and loneliness . " Was it also the verdict on all known Mayfields ?  --  his father , Grainger , his own moaning self ? He would not think that through  --  thought had done enough already to ruin his trip  --  but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past or present pains , he had given a first-rate imitation of contentment today : a life in harness to round greased wheels , the wheels rolling quiet and smooth , level ground . No pen in sight though . Rob opened the one long drawer to hunt , silently ; he knew he was now out of bounds ( drawers of the Kendal house were private as toilets ) . Two cheap steel pens , a bottle of red ink , a neat further lot of school work , gradebooks , a small picture-frame face down toward the back . Rob naturally took it , raised it out to the dim hot goosenecklamp , and looked . His mother and himself , no question of either , though he 'd never seen the picture and ( despite his age in it  --  four , maybe five ) did not remember the day or the sitting . His mother was gazing deadlevelat the camera , her dark hair lustrous and straight as an Indian 's rising from a high smooth forehead to a height half that of her face , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back as if ready to answer or to tell the man No , the darks of her eyes enormously deep and lit by real light , her right brow raised not in anger or question but as if to throw one single line askew . Her right hand was hid in the lap of a fine light summer dress ; her left lay free on the arm of the chair . Rob himself stood by that , his own eyes down , as grave as some leader at the end of a life  --  a white sailor suit , blue-trimmed ; a wood whistle on an oddly knotted cord roundp205his neck , untouched . Eva seemed to have borne all the weight of the world , to be bearing it then with unquestioned competence , no hint of complaint , only the firm reservation of her eyes as they spoke their sentence , I am bearing it . I can . I can not stop you watching . Rob touched his dry lips to the cool glass above her . Then he carefully returned the frame to its place and wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in Richmond . Dear Della , Safe trip , much obliged for help , I trust to see you before you see this . R.M.Then he wiped the pen clean with paper from the grate , turned out the one light , raised the two windows higher , stripped himself entirely , and lay down to sleep on top of the cover . His troubles though real were as old as he , as natural as his hair or the eggs of his groin and older in power and need than they . His body had learned to live in their presence if he 'd only trust his body , surrender his mind . He trusted it now , made a quick sweet resort to its offer of pleasure ( no image before him of any living creature : himself a closed engine , adequate and lovely ) ; then he slept . Plain rest . HE woke in clear light to a cool house , still silent . For the fifteen minutes that he lay slowly surfacing , he thought it was only a little past dawn and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had started another experiment  --  that this was his home , this room his room ; that his parents were overhead sleeping still or silently conducting the secret rites which parents require , rites which did not exclude him but in fact had summoned his existence and now by repetition insured his continuance , his own eventual manhood . He could bear the thought easily and began to expand it to include the pictured bodies of his father and Polly , their faces in the spreading rictus of joy , both younger than now , unmarked by their lives . Rob had had no prior occasion in his life for such a soothing game and would have run on to the vivid end of his present vision ; but through windows the station clock started its chime . He counted ten strokes and thought it was wrong ( outside the town was as still as the house ) ; but he jumped up and went to his watch on the desk and found it was ten . Naked , he stood by the windows in dry sun and listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child 's blank fears  --  They are gone or dead . There scented to be rare muffled knocks from the kitchen.  |p206Unwashed  , Rob scrambled into his clothes ; opened the door ; stepped into the hall and listened . He was barefoot . The kitchen door was shut . No speaking voices but there were sounds of work with water and metal , so he went there and knocked . A considerable wait . Polly said " Is it you ? " "  --  Rob if that 's who you mean . " " I did , " she said . He opened . She turned from the sink , not smiling . He saw his bare toes , ugly as most . " Excuse me , " he said and pointed to his feet , " I was scared . " " What of ? " " The house sounded empty . " " Your father has gone . " She had not yet smiled , and she turned back to scouring a deep black pan . Rob suddenly laughed . In place on the doorsill , he laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite her seriousness , was forced to join . She stopped before him though and said " ' What 's the joke ? " " That he 's gone , " Rob said . " Lady , he was never here . " She smiled but she said , " I am Polly , again ; and yes he was here . He 's been here twenty years , wherever else he had n't been , and will be back by two p.m. , I know , if he lives that long . " She paused till it reached him . " Are you ready for breakfast ? " Rob remembered . His father had told him last night  --  he must leave at eight-thirty to teach Bible-class at school ; then be monitor at chapel ; then preside at dinner for the hundred summer students , his duty once a month . Rob nodded he was ready . " I 'll put on my shoes . " " Not for me , " Polly said . " Stay cool while you can . Sit down and start your coffee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs ; and Rob moved on to the table by the window , a long narrow table painted red . Polly set the brown eggs in a bowl by the sink , took a thick white mug , and filled it with coffee from a blue enamel pot . She brought it to the table , set it by Rob 's hand . He noticed again her youth in her hands ; and when she returned to the stove to cook , he fixed on them in their quick neat work  --  frying bacon slowly with the gravest care ; cracking eggs , whipping , scrambling . Bare of rings , her hands were also unmarked by age or damage , only the intricate cords of her strength obeying her will which was also her wish . Rob 's throat was rushed by a hot contentment he had not felt for years , since childhood surely ( he recognized the flood but could not remember or pause to recover the rare occasions ; they would all involve Eva ) . He sat and welcomed it , not even so much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked toward him . His first clear thought was " She likes this work " ; then its valid extension , " She is working for me . " Ile had seldomp207been served in a safe calm room by a young white woman who was not simultaneously pleading for rescue , the chance to accompany his life from that moment . He took a long draft of the hot black coffee and said , " You 're a very happy lady ; am I right ? " She was spooning the eggs from the pan to a platter . She did not look round ; but she said " Well  --  " ; then stopped , clearly searching for an answer . Rob waited and she brought the food over to him  --  the eggs and meat , then a plate of fresh biscuits . He thanked her and she went to the opposite chair and stood straight behind it , her hands holding firm on the thick side-rails . Her face was serious though not deeply troubled . She said again " Well " and smiled . " Half-yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Lady ' every day . Many do n't think I 'm that , but many are meaner than mad dogs in August . I think I 've been happy though  --  by nature , I mean . I have to be , do n't I ? " Rob said " Why ? " Polly studied him carefully ; then pulled out the chair and sat upright , not leaning toward the table . " Your eyes look strong . You can see good , ca n't you ? " Rob nodded ( he was eating ) . " And you 're twenty-one years old ? " " Yes ma 'm , " he said . " Then you ought not to ask . " With one hand she stirred a large circle of air before her chest , by which she meant her life , her surroundings . Rob said , " I 'm sorry . I 'm not the brightest Mayfield . " Polly studied again . " You may be , " she said , " and do n't all the time be begging for pardon that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someday you might , so you do n't want to wear out my pardons now . " She had brought herself to smile . Rob nodded . " Sure . Damn me . " " That 's not called for either yet , " she said . They both paused then  --  Rob eating , Polly watching . At last she leaned forward and offered him a glass dish of fig preserves ; she stayed that much closer ( just her hands on the table edge ) and said , " Could you tell me why he asked you to come ? I mean , I 'm glad to meet you  --  " " He did n't , " Rob said . " It was my idea . He heard from Grainger that I was in trouble and wrote me to offer what help he could ; but coming after twenty-one years of silence , it did n't exactly thrill me , you know . I figured I had got by that long without him . " " Your mother left him . " " So they tell me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But why does he have that picture of Mother and me as a boy ? " Polly said , " It appeared on his birthday one year . I think he asked for it . You better ask him . " " No matter , " Rob said.  | " Oh it may be , " she said , " to you and him . " She paused . " You were telling me about your visit . " Rob faced her , eye-level . " You want me to leave . I 'm leaving once I eat . " His face could have been read as angry or joking . She worked at reading him , decided on anger . Her own eyes suddenly filled with tears . She struck the table gently with both flat palms . " Yes , " she said . Rob laid down his fork . " How have I harmed you please ? " he said . It took her awhile before she could speak ; but she never looked down or hid her face , never loosened the grip of her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not sure it 's harm . All I know is I 'm scared . I had the worst night of my life last night , saw things I never really hoped to see . I take what is offered to me in sleep as serious , maybe more so than what comes in daylight , but that 's just me . You surprised me , you see  --  whyever you 're here . I have answered that same door for more than twenty years ; and I do n't remember ever letting in one soul that meant me harm  --  ever answering to one ( Grainger came in the back door and left that way ) . I was brought here by your Granddad Rob ; and I tended to him till he died in his sleep  --  sleep is just as real as day . I was left just a young woman , nowhere to go but back to my funny old dad I mentioned . Then your father came here to see to the funeral ; and since he was also at the end of his rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook ; take care of the place . It turned out he 'd already got his present job and needed a home . The house of course was his ( and his sister 's , I guess ) ; and he treated me as decently as anybody ever had in nineteen years . Much more so really ; he 's a gentleman of God , whatever else he is . If you do n't think a nineteen-yearoldgirl who has grown up in cities and kept a museum of Confederate junk has met a lot of treatment that was far less than decent , then you do n't know girls or cities either . Not to mention museums . But you probablydo . Anyhow I accepted . He had his job in Bracey till the end of April ; so I cleaned around here good and then locked up and went to Washingtontill May  --  on the train , one bag . I 'm a Washington girl . I had left my dad there a good while before with his museum to tend , when I came down here . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if I left him not to ever come back . And I nine-tenths believed him ( he will change his mind thirty times an hour about himself , but he 's set like lockjaw in what he thinks of others ) ; so when I walked up to his Washingtondoor , I did n't know whether he would spit or kiss me . He managed both . At first he pretended he did n't recognize me . I stepped in the open door , bag in hand , and went to the table where he sat selling tickets . He glanced up briefly and then back down and said ' Ladies five cents . ' I went along with him . I fished out a nickel , of which there were few , and pushed it toward him . Iic actually took it , put it in his tin box , pointed to the rooms where his old stuff was and said ' Take your time . ' I had to stop itp209there  --  I am happy by nature but bad at jokes ; they always scare me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know that , ' he said . He was reading the memoirs of P. T. Barnum for the eight-hundredth time and went back to them , really read on awhile ; I could see his eyes flicking . I was young enough to figure he was asking me to beg . Well , I 've never minded begging ; that 's all prayer is , except for the few little compliments to God which I 'm sure He ignores . I said , I have got a two-month vacation till my next job starts ; and I 've come home to help you . ' He still looked down  --  ' What help would that be ? ' I said , I doubt it 'll be any help , now you mention it ( I 'll cook you some meals ) ; but it might be fun . I 'm goodnatured , remember ? ' He thought that over and apparently remembered and pointed to the stairs and said , Your bed 's where it was , not used since you left . ' So I took my satchel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The sheets I had slept in my last night at home were still on the bed with my wrinkles in them , my hair on the pillow ( I hemstitched the pillowslip at age eleven ; I 'd know it on the moon ) . Strangest old bear in the woods , my dad ; but from that minute on , he acted like I 'd never been gone ten minutes ; and we did have fun . We always had , nothing out of the ordinary  --  talking and teasing . I stayed two months and cooked and cleaned and sold people tickets to see his poor show ( by then he had bought a little railroad stock and was halfway solvent ) ; and then your dad wrote me toward the end of April and said everything was straight on the rails and would I beat him there and air-out the house ? I washed my few duds and , that night at supper , said ' Tomorrow'sthe day ' ; and Dad said About time . ' I cooked his next breakfast and packed and combed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say goodbye , so I caught the streetcar to the 12:2o train and have not been back . I 've written of course and he answers now and then if he 's got some funny news . I 've been right here in the Mayfield house ; and excepting the last few weeks of Grainger 's stay , I have generally been happy . " Polly stopped and sat a moment ; then again touched the table with her beautiful hands , this time more nearly caressing than striking . She was smiling mildly . Rob had eaten throughout her story . Now he set down his fork and said , " Why did you tell me all that please ? " His tone and face were pleasant . She had not lost her way . She knew at once . " To show why I wanted you to leave , " she said . " Then you failed , I 'm afraid ; or maybe I just failed to understand . " " That 's it , " she said , still smiling . " I was clear as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I hate for you to take it . " house , you mean ? You can have my share when the great day comes ; of course I do n't know who else has claims . Maybe Mayfields abound ; I suspect they do . "  |p210She  was grave again and , firm in her purpose , she neglected to offer Rob fresh hot coffee . " Not the house , " she said , " though it is a good house ; and I 'm rightly grateful to it . No you 're making me say it when I hoped you would see . I mean Forrest Mayfield . He is what I have . " Hearing that , Rob discovered in himself a hardness he had not used in months , more likely in years . He actually thought of Min Tharrington 's face as she turned from his meanness four years ago . But again he accepted its demands and said , " Could you live without him ? " " Of course I could ; people live blind and dumb with no arms or legs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to ; I would pray not to  --  and I 'm not a church-goer . " " Me either , " Rob said . Polly thrust to the rank tender center of her fear . " Did n't Eva send you here ? " She stopped and flushed deeply , from embarrassment not pain . " Your mother , I mean . He still calls her Eva when he mentions her at all ; I 've never seen her face . " Rob said " Yes she did , " the coldness still in him , though he knew he had n't lied . Polly said , " I knew that . I knew she 'd try again . " Rob nodded but was silent . " That picture you saw on Forrest 's desk ? " " In his drawer , " Rob said . " Then he hid it from you ; it 's always been out . She sent him that picture from a clear blue sky on his birthday five years after she 'd left him , five years without one word or sign when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forget you both . " Rob said " With you helping . " " So right , " Polly said . " I was helping like fury . I had met the postman that day , like I said ; and here was a little square package for Forrest . I did n't know the writing ; but I knew the postmark and knew anything sent from Fontaine , N. C. was bound to harm him . So I hid it at first in the hall-table drawer ; he was here eating breakfast , set to leave for school . I did n't know whether I would open it first or burn it ; but I lied to him then , just gave him a bill and a card from his sister and said that was all . Then once he was gone , I tried to work and think . The Christian thing was to wait till evening and say it had come in the afternoon mail ; he 'd at least have evening and night to recover in , whatever the damage . But by noon I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back here and opened it as secret as if I was some hateful enemy at night , not his help at noon . I was sick as I did it  --  the knots in the string  --  but nothing like as sick as I got to be when I saw those faces : Eva Mayfield and Rob . I stood up to burn it . Who on earth would know ? Strings of pearls are lost in the mail every day , not to mention pictures of people who left you to struggle alone . " Rob said " What stopped you ? "  | " The fact I was n't sure . I was nine-tenths certain  --  I had the postmark  --  but , see , I had never seen Eva or you . He 'd denied to me that he owned any pictures  --  said he had her living presence so why take pictures ?  --  andI do n't think he lied . You were too young to resemble him yet ; he had n't taken charge of your eyes and mouth the way he has since . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slim chance that woman and child were somebody else and were safe to us both ( there was no note or card in the package , just faces ; the letter came the next day , delayed somehow ) ; so I wrapped it back up and put it on his desk with the afternoon mail , and he never gave me one hint of getting it . He was a little quiet at supper , I thought ; but that could have just been tiredness from school . Then the next day , the letter in the morning mail . He took it off with him unopened on the streetcar ; and still not a word to me , not a flicker . I was sick all through it ; but again if he noticed , he kept his own counsel . I knew he was thinking . And I knew very well my life was before him in some kind of balance with you and your mother . Every day when he 'd leave , I 'd hunt for the letter ; I guess it was at school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot shame after sixteen years . " Rob said , " You could leave . You are not chained down . " But she nodded . " I was . " " A baby ? " he said . She shut her eyes , shook her head . " Never . No . " She waited and swallowed as if at a knot of dry cloth in her throat . Then she looked again . " I understand a lot from you being here  --  his past , I mean ; what your mother put him through . You are hers all right . " " I am , " Rob said . " I 'm sorry to be . " " Too late now , " she said . Rob said , " Maybe not . She left me as sure as she left Forrest May-field . " Polly shook her head again . " She never left Forrest , not for good , still has n't . I found the letter . After nearly three weeks , I went in to clean his study one morning ; and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I sat down and tried to study it calmly . I was cold as Christmas . You 've seen it yourself ; you know what it says even now after years  --  Isthere some way back ? " Rob said " I doubt that , " though he did n't doubt it . Polly said , " You would n't if you 'd read the letter . I found it in his desk drawer ; he 'd brought it home the same day . It disappeared later and I guess he may have burned it or I 'd show it to you now . But I sure God read it three times that day . She started out by asking how he liked his work ( she had got some news from Hattie and his Richmond address ) ; then she went on with news from you and her ( funny things you were saying , little jobs she was doing  --  hooking rugs , crocheting for various friends ) ; then she said everything there was going on as ever except thatp212her brother had got married recently and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own house was built some while in the future and that seams were bursting , not to mention people 's patience . " " They were , " Rob said . " I was sleeping in her room . That was just the true news she was telling him , no begging in that . " " Oh there was , " Polly said . " Forrest knew it well . The picture was the begging , and it shook him to the sockets . " " You said he never spoke . " " I can see , " she said , " and I watched him for days as close as I could ; he kept shy of me . In his study always writing , little notebooks he 'd take back to school every morning . Then he gradually eased and talked to me more ; and one night I went in to where he was working to tell him good night and found him so calm that I got nerve to say Is that Eva and Rob ? '  --  ' Are n't they lovely ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking through his eyes , though for all those weeks ( looking just through my own ) I had felt like wiping you both off the earth and had prayed for the power . " She managed to smile at the end of that ; it was clearly an end , a fistula drained . Rob touched his white cup . " I would give a good deal for some coffee , " he said . " Such as what ? " She was playing . Rob was thoroughly grave . " This much for certain , which I wo n't take back  --  I came here purely on my own . I was hurting . He can tell you how . It is not to do with him , not directly . I have not blamed him for anything ever ; and I did n't come here with messages or claims from me or anybody . I was down , far down ; he asked me to come here , and here I 've been . I 'm leaving as I said . " He began to fold his napkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the stove where the blue pot was steaming . She touched it with the flat of her hand , satisfaction ; and brought it to his cup , poured it carefully . On her way to the stove again ( her face turned from him ) , she said , " You 've been sick lately , you mean ? " Rob laughed a dry chuff . "  --  As a dog , " he said . " Maybe past curing . " Polly turned to face him and touched her own breastbone with her strong right thumb . " Your chest ? Is it that ? " Rob mimicked her gesture in the center of his forehead . " My empty head . " Polly came back and sat while he sweetened his coffee . " Empty of what ? " " Do n't make me , " Rob said . " He made me last night , and it did n't help at all . " She nodded . " I 'm sorry . " She waited , Rob drank . Then tracing a delicate curve on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes on the curve ) , she said , " I am going to tell you the truth . I aIn thirty-nine years old so no need to lie . I have loved three people iii all that time . Myp213mother died when I was born , so Dad was the first . He never needed me ; I 've shown you that . The second was Rob Mayfield , long dead . I came here with him and eased his death ; he died right beside me , and I never even stirred ( and I as light a sleeper as a bird on a bough ) . The third was your dad  --  and I trust will be the last . " Her tracing finger lifted and her eyes met Rob 's . Again she had reached some end of her own . Rob waited till he saw she had finished her message . It had not reached him , but he first said " Thank you . " Polly nodded . " Very welcome . " Then he said , " How is that meant to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It means I have told you all I know . " " Did you marry my grandfather ? " " No . We spoke about it but he did n't want that . He had run from his children ; he had to save them something . " " This house ? " " This house and the few things in it . " " One of which was you ? " Rob intended it kindly as plain description . Polly read his intent . " You could say that . " She smiled . " Youwould n't be the first . I was part of his leavings , but I wanted to be . " Did you marry my father ? " She shook her head slowly . " He is married , " she said . " He 's also married . You know , your mother . He wo n't change that , would n't change it if he could ; and I do n't know the law , have n't tried to learn . He has not ever spoken about it to me except that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you lovely ? That broke me from questions . " She was smiling still . " You said a few minutes ago you were happy . " " By nature , I said . " She paused , thought it through . " And also by luck . They were three kind men , Rob and Forrest especially . I call that luck . " "  --  That they kept you a servant ? " Again she tested his face for malice , the edge of his voice . " That they cherished me . " She had said it gently ; but the words drew behind them a flock of feelings  --  pride , secret joy , continuing hope ( however assailed )  --  that decked her face and shoulders all fresh with a greater beauty of light and depth , victory and promise , than Rob had witnessed on any other form except his own mother 's the dawn he had crept home stinking from Flora after high-school commencement and found his mother awake and extending what she never meant to give . Lacked the will to give , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Thank you , " Polly said . " That is all my hope . I love them surely . And I 've told them , many ways . I can beg for you that you 'll have such a life . " She waved round her slightly with one slow hand as if all her timep214and luck were gathered in this warm room and were visible  --  witness and proof . Half-smiling , Rob looked . Then he said " Beg who ? " " Well , I pray some , " she said . " I mentioned that . " Rob said " Wait please , " even held out a staying hand . " I doubt I could bear it . " " Me praying ? " "  --  Such a life . " " Then you 'll die young , " she said , " or dry at the heart before your time . No Mayfield has , not in my sight at least . " He waited a good while ; his question was n't idle . " Say what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " My mother , " he said . " Anybody with a chance of lasting you for life ? " " No ma 'm , " Rob said . " One or two love me . " " Pick the strong one , " Polly said . WHEN Rob drove up by the dark hotel , his own frail headlamps were the only light . He cut them ; cut the harassed engine ; and hands on the wheel still , slumped round a sudden hole in his chest through which the gains of the past two days , gains that had fueled him in calm elation through the long trip back , seemed unstanchably flowing . For the past three hours , he had only thought of sleep ( he had no watch but the fact of darkness in Mr. Hutchins ' room meant eleven at least , maybe twelve or one ) ; and as he was now , sleep seemed not only desirable but urgent . His strength had measured itself with utter economy , had lasted him to this dark yard precisely . Yet when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second-floor porch , the hall , his room ) but back toward Grainger 's and Della 's rooms . The end of his strength was taking him there in no light at all ; there was no moon or stars . He opened their front door and entered the trapped warm air of their hall . The door on the left was Grainger 's . Rob stroked it twice with his knuckles . No answer . More firmly , two knocks . No voice or move . He felt down the ribbed pine of the door to the china knob and turned it and pushed . Grainger 's close black air  --  every window chinked shut  --  stood to meet him , a solid clement neither foul nor harsh but such as no white man could lay clown around him or breathe for long , a separate diet . Rob took ap215step inward and said once " Grainger  --  " Nothing , though Grainger slept lightly as a rule . He took a second step , raised his voice and called again . When only silence answered , Rob felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way through the foreign air till his hands found the edge of Grainger 's bed , then blindly searched it . The covers were thrown back , the thin pillow crumpled ; and though they were hotter than the room  --  freshly used  --  they were empty of Grainger . Rob stood and tried once more , whispering " Grainger ? " Then he went out quickly to the hall  --  Della 's door , stood and strained to hear . Nothing again . Or was there a single whimper , smothered ? Rob did not knock but found the knob easily and opened full . The same thick element ; the dry sounds of movement , skin on cloth . " Something wrong ? " " Della ? " A stupified wait , more movement . " Something wrong ? " " May be . Della ? " " You back , " Della said . Rob could not speak , for gratitude . " You hungry ? " she said . He knew that he was , that likely she had some cold bread on her bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grainger ; but he said " You alone ? " Della laughed . " Is a rock ? " He said " Yes " as if she 'd intended an answer , then began at the buttons of his shirt and was naked in fifteen seconds . He stood in the pile of shed clothes and said " Where is Grainger now ? " " In Heaven if the Lord be merciful to me . " " He 's not in his room , but his bed is warm . " " You go on back and wait for him then and keep it warm , not waking me up when I need rest to talk about a fool that I had n't seen since dark tonight . " Rob regretted his bareness , however concealed , and knew he should quietly dress and leave  --  Della to the few hours ' sleep before dawn when she 'd rise to cook ; himself to ruinous solitary night , his heart still draining . " You going or staying ? " Her voice was as harsh as in dealing with Grainger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal deep in her , the actual high smell of fingered brass , the shock of tin on his own back teeth . But he went on toward her and met her silent welcome  --  her thin white gown shucked quickly ; her short close bones and hot dense skin extended as an unseen harbor , a bed , in which he could hunt again the consolation of permitted triumph . Hunt and , as always , find . Even as he hooked his bristling chin on the hinge of Della 's shoulder ( he had never touched her mouth ) and felt for her hipbones to haul her upward ( shep216never moved at first of her own accord , only toward the end ) , he knew he would win this time as always . One good thing which had never yet refused him . It did n't now . Exhausted as he was from the trip , the real journey , the whole elaboratenet of his senses poised itself slowly ( no haste , no fear ) ; cast itself surely and caught its small prey  --  a spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which his total body met a rest so perfect , reward so sufficient , that he did not resent Della 's own private seizure , her hoarse employment of what seemed now a distant county of a country at peace . Nor the cries she stifled in the heel of her hand , a blind fed puppy . " You all right ? " she said . " Now , " he said . " Well , you back like I said . " She touched the knob at the back of his neck , the crest of his spine beneath which his powers of movement lay bound in a simple cord . " Not for long " Rob said . " Where you headed ? " " Out of here . " " When you leaving ? " " Not sure . " " Who you taking ? " Rob paused , uncertain of her meaning . " You come here with Grainger . Who you taking when you leave ? " Rob thought that he knew . For the first time today , in all his life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; go with him toward a life he could live . He could not tell Della , not now in her arms  --  rank , wet with her gift . TEN minutes later , threading rocks and roots in the yard , he passed his car on the way to sleep ; and Grainger 's voice whispered " You all right , Rob ? " Rob was too tired for fear , but he stopped and searched the dark before answering . He thought he detected some signs that Grainger was sitting on the nearside runningboard , so he said " Where you been ? " Grainger said " You the traveler . " Rob came closer to him , stopped five feet away . It was Grainger ; Grainger 's heat reached him even through the cool air of mountain night . He could not now remember why he 'd sought Grainger first half an hour ago or what he might have said if Grainger had been waiting ; but he knew he must not cheat him now and leave without sonic greeting . Rob went to the car and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You have been to New Jersey and Maine and prance. "  |p217Grainger  waited awhile . " You been to Richmond ? " Rob also waited . " Yes thank you , " he said . " See your daddy ? "  --  Yes . " " Miss Polly ? " " yes . " " They doing all right ? " " Good as anybody else , " Rob said . " They treat you nice ? " " Very nice , " Rob said . " Good food , good bed . " " You like your daddy ? " " All right , " Rob said . " Too early to know . " " He going to help you ? " Rob said " He tried . " " Talked to you a lot ? " Rob laughed . " He 's a talker . Nothing wrong with that Polly 's publicspeakingeither . " " Never was , " Grainger said . He laughed , then waited . " He get you a job ? " " He said he would try . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could send you to school . " Rob said , " That might be a good idea . " "  --  Being nigger or smart ? " " Some of both , I guess . " " Too late , " Grainger said . " Could be , " Rob said , " but I may keep trying . I just now came from rubbing on black . " He pointed toward the quarters , dark as it was . Grainger said " I seen you . " " Where were you then ? " " Out here . I mean I heard you coming out . " Rob said , " Where were you before that ? I went to your room . " " I been looking for you . " " You 'll get yourself shot , poking round at night . These mountaineers do n't give you time to explain , specially if you 're dark . " Grainger said , " You the one been poking , not me . More people shot for poking than looking . " " Where the Hell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you I had gone on a trip ? " " Would n't ask Della for moisture in a drouth . I knew where you were . I was waiting not looking . I could n't get to sleep . I was down by the spring  --  worked there all day ; got the new shingles on . Start cleaning it tomorrow . " Rob hauled himself to his numbing feet and walked a step . " Stop waiting , " he said . " For God 's sake , stop . I 'm back . Day 's coming . " " I 'll see , " Grainger said . Ilc also stood , came toward Rob , and easilyp218found Rob 's wrist with his fingers . He ringed the wrist tightly and twisted three times before Rob pulled free . " If day come , " he said ( he was whisperingagain ) " you look at that good ; see did dark rub off . Did  --  it come off Grainger . Grainger give you your wish . " AT the hint of day five hours later , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from sleep , awake in the instant , though he 'd slept only five hours since turning in at one after finishing a letter to Rob in the study . He had stayed on at school till three on Sunday ; then had come home to find Polly gone , no note . He had read until five  --  a search in Vergil  --  when he 'd heard her come in , climb straight to her room , and shut her door quietly . She often took walks ; he knew she was low from Robinson'svisit , a state which he counted on time to repair ; so he 'd read on till six ; then despite their having late supper on Sundays , he wondered at her silence and went to the foot of the steps and listened . Nothing at all . He 'd called out mildly , " Are you starving me from home ? " and after a while , she opened her door ( her face webbed with sleep ) and said " No it 's yours . "  --  " Please feed me then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to wash her face . He helped her in the kitchen ; and they ate with few words on the smallest subjects ( Polly ate very little ) . He had tried to crystallize in his mind one thing he could say to satisfy her , to acknowledge his thanks and the size of her care , to honor her fears but belittle them gently . Nothing useful would come , only lines with multiple edges , all keen  --  " Did you take to him ? " " Can we help him at all ? " " Should we try now or have we already done enough ? " So while she cleared the table , Forrest sat and watched her face till at last he could say , " Is there anything you need to ask me , Polly ? " She had drawn a pan of water and begun to wash dishes before she said ( her face still to Forrest ) , " I need to know how much is changed . "  --  " Nothing " rushed to his lips ; but he 'd held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd stood to go do Monday 's preparations , he 'd said , " I will tell you as soon as I know . " She had nodded , not turning ; and he 'd worked on his lessons till he heard her turn in , then had started the necessary letter to Rob . When he 'd finished and climbed to bed at one , he had not paused at Polly 's open door , though he 'd noticed the darkness and silence beyond it and felt the intensity of baffled waiting . Now at dawn , a little startled to be thoroughly rested by so little sleep , Forrest lay in cool sheets on his narrow bed and consulted his body with the flats of his own broad hands under cloth . lle did not often touch himself at leisure and , though he had never despised the offers of pleasure ( even transport ) , lie lacked the voluptuary 's constant wonder in the constantresources of self , simple meat . But what pleased his hands now wasp219firm lean health  --  the fact that , with no conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withstood years ; his body had ignored these fifty-four years ( or , say , the past fifteen : he looked a man of thirty-eight and felt it ) , though he knew there were millions of ambushes gathering , suicides planned in every cell . With his hands on the hot dry stripes of his groin , where his long legs became his high full balls ( the balls of a boy in the first rush of power , the embarrassed crest of male generosity ) , Forrest said to himself what he suddenly knew and had not known before , " I have chosen this . " It was something that he might have guessed long before  --  twentyoneyears before , naked in a stream near Panacea Springs , having seen Eva leave him the final time . He had waited till now  --  a gift from Rob ? his letter to Rob ? Polly 's separate fear one room away ? He was roused as always by real news , by knowledge  --  roused in spirit . So he rose , poured water in his china bowl ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , washed his mouth and eyes , and walked to Polly 's doorway . Her eyes were open ; she was facing him . She lay on her right side and faced him unsmiling ; her left arm splayed back behind her grotesquely , boneless or wrenched . Forrest wanted to speak . If he 'd been fully dressed or covered by darkness , he could have stood ground on the sill and said , " Very little is changed . Maybe nothing at all . Whatever may flow from these two days will not move you . " But he stood in pale daylight in the crumpled absurdityof underwear at the end of her gaze ; so he did what he seldom did at all , maybe ten times a year , and never till now without her permission . He walked quickly in and sat at the foot of Polly 's bed . They were silent awhile ; then he said " Have you slept ? " " I think so , " she said . She looked to her window ; the green shade was down . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forrest sought her shin through cloth , a muffled blade . " Five-thirty , " he said . Polly did not move her leg from his grip . He took that to be her latest permission ; and waiting a moment to allow her denial , he touched the sheet on the crest of her shoulder and drew it down enough to allow his entry into space that was neat as if she 'd made it freshly to greet his arrival and cool as the coolest hour of the night which had left him so ready  --  the night through which , he now understood , she could not have slept . He stayed on his back in the narrow place , touching Polly nowhere , and fixed on the single black light-cord that hung from the spotted ceiling like a plumb . It seemed to promise that the answer he would give  --  must give in a moment  --  would be true and just , merciful and grateful . He waited for words . Polly touched his arm , with one left finger . Then she raised herself very slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her head ; her hair was loose -- -then dropped it on the clean floor and lay flat herself.  |p220Forrest  took that as his best hope of answer . Years of contiguous restraint had given their bodies a gift of speech more lucid than words ; their rare full meetings had therefore preserved the power to delight , deepen mystery , appall , but chiefly to confirm in plain detail with a logic as bare as the figures of Euclid their mutual love . They confirmed it now in mutual silence . The sounds around them were the sounds of objects  --  cloth , wood , iron , the approving air . Done and rested and the room filling quickly with Monday through gaps at the edge of the shade , Forrest only said , " I must leave in an hour . " " All right , " Polly said . " You dress ; I 'll cook . " She raised herself again and fished for her gown . " What you teaching them today ? " " The names of God in fourteen tongues . " She laughed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed in Goshen had sunk to the lowest shelf of sleep . She had gone to bed early in search of refuge from the speculations of her mother and the Roberts boys , the dumb pain of Grainger , her own fear and hope ; and of course she 'd pitched restless through the next three hours till the whole house was quiet . Then she 'd paddled through a long stretch of what seemed no more than harassed darkness ( a cruel taunting ) but was actually sleep , hectic and frail yet deep enough to shield her from the various sounds of Rob 's return . Some ear in her mind perceived that though  --  his arrival in his room , his quiet undressing , not his visit with Della or talk with Grainger  --  and freed her then to begin the oblivion she 'd wanted since Friday when he 'd left with his curious promise to come back bearing the word that would win her or to hunt it at least . So she 'd roamed through a number of levels of rest on her slow descent  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sleep ( little poems , long volleys of witty exchange , neat but lethal retorts : all gone before day ) , a tale in which she was learning from Lucy ( Della 's long-dead mother ) how to carve up dirt into squares like candy that would please her father who did not like sweets , a perfect list of the names of the children she had known in school from the age of seven till nine years later when she 'd finished with honors  --  but no trace of Rob . Her mind thought of that , the peculiar omission , tried to force itself to imagine his face and rig a tale round it , to sort through the language in search of a word which by day she could give him , the necessary word . No use . She was flat on the bottom of rest , all voices appeased , whenp221at six-thirty Monday , a hand on her door . Or a long warning maybe . She wrenched herself conscious with the thought that the hotel was far-gone in flames , one hand struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ? " , checked the windows for safety  --  clear morning , no smoke . But no voice answered . Then again gentle knocking . " Father ? " " No . Rob . " She reached for her robe and was almost at the door when he opened it a little . " Good morning , " she said . He nodded . " I 'm back . " " You are ; I see . I 've thought about you . " " I 've thought some myself . " " About what ? " she said . " Living my life or not . " Against her will , she smiled . " You 're white and twenty-one . Did you reach a conclusion ? " " I hope so , " he said , " but first , have you ? " Even torn from sleep , Rachel could not hedge or lie . " Not yet , " she said . Rob said , " Then listen . If I was planning to live out a life , some decent sort of life , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If someone had said to me Compose the speech you would most need to hear from a person you love , ' could I have guessed this ?  --  guessed anything half as close as this ? " " You do n't have to answer this minute , " he said . He must leave for work or forfeit the job . " Are you planning that ? " she said . " It depends , I guess . " Rob had not smiled yet . " On me ? " " Yes ma 'm . " He smiled and ducked a little bow . As his head reached its low point and saw her bare feet , white as tallow and dry , he knew he had lied , though he did not know he 'd forget that knowledge , remember it only long months from now . " Then thank you , " she said . " You will ? " " Yes thank you . " Smiling still , Rob clamped his eyes shut and nodded . Then he looked again and said , " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rachel said . " He has got some say . " Ron had worked late on Monday , been exhausted and gone to bed once he 'd eaten , barely speaking to Rachel and not even seeing her father orp222mother . On Tuesday when he reached the hotel at seven , this letter was waiting on the dark hall-table . He went to his room and read it before washing . August 16 , 1925 Dear Robinson , I had hoped that somehow you could hold off leaving till I got back from school ; but I well understand how you had to leave . What a cruel distance , and twice in two days . I only hope you are safely there and will rest tonight for your new week tomorrow . It is strange for me that after long years of having you out of my cares entirely ( though not from my griefs , however buried ) , I now find I 've worried all evening about you ; guessed at your whereabouts , pictured your condition . I suppose you have felt , if you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with very little struggle , which would also mean little struggle for you . That is less than half-true . I wrote strong letters , sent valuable gifts returned by Mr. Kendal , and made a last trip to Fontaine in August ( you were five months old ; I was not allowed to see you ) . Then I pled on by mail till I saw , was profoundly made to know , two related facts  --  Eva and me . We were separate and strange to one another as a cat and a dog , though without that enmity . We never once fought , however hard we spoke in the effort not to lie . A cat can be made to adopt a puppy if his mother dies ; she will even nurse him if she has milk to give ; but however grateful and needful he becomes , she will walk off and leave him when he 's big enough to wean . Claw him blind if need be ; I 've seen it happen . And the puppy will imagine desperation and death . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek his own kind . You know all that . What a puppy can not do or a full-grown dog is imagine and feel the weight and value of a fellow creature as I 've imagined yours this afternoon and evening ( it is past midnight ) , to my deep surprise . It has been my observation in fifty years of watching that few men are capable of close attention over long spans of time to another human being . That is woman 's great gift and her steadiest pain , to gaze at another for years on years and care each moment as much as for herself , occasionally more . My sister Hattie , Rena Kendal ( from what you tell me ) , Polly Drewry , maybe Grainger . Of the men I have watched  --  maybe Grainger , now me ( or me again : I felt this with Eva , but it had to fade ) . Is it also your burden ?  --  too great an attention ? From the two talks we had , I suspect it may be ; and because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company of books ( by no means the safe flight or warm consolation so often charged ) and because I believe from my own experience and that of men far my superiors in life that the wisdom of a few books carefully studied will prove more useful and slightly less wearing than the raw frayp223of life  --  because of those things , I have searched this evening for a passage in Vergil which began to pull at the edge of my mind through all you told me of your own life and worries . You said that you read Book Four of the Aeneid under Thorne Bradley in school ; I do not know that you read other parts or encountered this passage , so I write it out for you . ( I 'll confess that my own work has kept me from Vergil so long that I did indeed have to hunt for the lines . ) But first will you grant me , a lifelong teacher , a little preamble to set the stage ? Aeneas has fled the ruins of Troy and is borne on a storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused and despairing , having lost his wife , his father and home . There on Libyan sands his mother comes to him . She is Venus but disguised from his recognition as a huntress , armed . He sees her divinity , though not her name , and tells her his plight . She urges him onward to the palace in Carthage , the seat of Dido . Her parting words are , Perge modo et , qua to ducit via , derige gressum . Only proceed and walk with the road . From there , in light of your claim to bad Latin , may I translate for you ? She spoke and , turning , her rose neck shone . From the crown ambrosial hair breathed fragrance ; Raiment fell round her feet and in gait she was shown An actual god . He knew her as mother And chased her vanishing with words  --  " You cruel too ? Why tempt your son So often with false games ? Why may My right hand not greet yours and why Not hear true words and answer truthfully ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good they hold , restraining myself from comment but for this : remember her last words , Only proceed and walk with the road , and that , despite the cries of Aeneas , it is she who is godly and sees his fate , not miserable he . His fate is not her . I certainly do n't claim special powers of foresight or wisdom as to where your road must lead or what the road is ; but I can say this much now with some assurance . You can have a job here on January 1st in the business office . As I told you last night , the bursar 's clerk is retiring at seventy ( and none too soon ; no two columns of figures have balanced in the past five years ) . I went in to see the superintendent this afternoon and mentioned that you were in hopes of bettering your outlook , and could he help out ? IIe thought awhile and said he 'd intended to put a young Negro in the job , a graduate if possible ; but had recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some little traveling in the state and intop224Carolina , some meeting the public  --  bankers , preachers , etc . ) . So in short if you are inclined to take it , he would lean your way , I am virtually certain . He hinted as much , being heavy on hints and light on decisions ; but you must act fairly soon . First , tell me if you are interested . Then I 'll send you the outline of what he would want by way of application and references ( would Thorne recommend you ? who else in Fontaine ? would your present boss ? ) . Please give this good , but not slow , thought . You need to act soon . And if you should ask , as you very well may , why Forrest Mayfield comes now after twenty years of silence and absence , seeking company , I would answer you or Eva or anyone else something close to this . It is not for personal gain or even pleasure ( though I 'd hope to take pleasure in your nearness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of recompense ; of showing you something , after years with the Kendals , which one Mayfield at least has learned  --  in fact all the May fields I 've known before you : how simply to proceed . Any of the others could show you as well as I , I 'm sure  --  my father , were he here , or Hattie or Grainger  --  but I at least am willing and probably have less desperation of heart than they , which is my commendation . Thank you for coming here and hearing me out  --  well , hardly out . I have nothing if not a long stream of words , but we are after all amending the faults and omissions of decades . Many still yawn ; some will never bear filling . If you come back and stay  --  this home is ready for you ; it is yours as much as mine  --  I will work more quietly at a stronger repairing : by act , by deed . In any case , proceed , Son , and answer me please . Your hopeful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sideporch with Rachel till dark , talking only of what did n't matter a hair to anyone alive ( they were both a little rigid with the effort to avoid spoken recollection of yesterday 's promise ; and they separately wondered if they 'd dreamt the meeting , the contract made ) and when Mrs. Hutchins had said her good nights and gone indoors , pulling Rachel in her wake , Rob went to the corner where Mr. Hutchins sat every night till eleven and said , " May I sit here awhile , Mr. Hutchins ? " Mr. Hutchins said , " You 've paid for it . Sit anywhere . " Rob sat on the railing , his back to the night , feet hooked in the posts . IIe was six feet from Mr. Hutchins but eye-level to him . Rob sat awhile inp225silence ( Mr. Hutchins had started his final cigar ) . Then he said , " Have you known me long enough ? " He was smiling , though at air ; Mr. Hutchins was n't looking . " Long enough for what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait . " I think so , yes . " " Then tell me please . " Mr. Hutchins laughed . " Have n't known you that long . " Rob said " How 's that ? " " I mean I have my own clear opinion , but I do n't know you well enough to say if you could take it . " Rob said " It 's that bad ? " " It has some rough edges . " He did not laugh again , but his words were colored by the smile they slid through . He sucked at his cigar ; then he said , " Which one are you after ? " Rob said " Sir ? "  --  caught and chilled . " There are two women roughly your age around here . " Rob had honestly assumed himself to be invisible to the man . His plan , the speech he 'd relied on to come , was paralyzed . Mr. Hutchins said , " Have you been down to the spring since Grainger fixed the roof ? " Rob said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . " " You 're thirsty , I trust ? " " Yes sir , " Rob said with no conception of what would follow ( he had not passed a hundred words alone with Mr. Hutchins since moving here ) . Mr. Hutchins stood  --  " I 'll show you "  --  and was half-down the steps to the yard when Rob joined him . They had gone ten yards in the cooling thick darkness before Mr. Hutchins said , " I 've killed two rattlers right here since spring " and proceeded from there with slow high steps . Rob said " Grainger told me " and also stepped higher . Mr. Hutchins said , " Yes but Grainger did n't kill them , came calling for me " ; and neither spoke again ( they were flanking the quarters ) till they reached the springhouse , an open-sided octagon twelve feet across , lattice work all round maybe three feet high . Mr. Hutchins paused at the entranceside and reached up to touch the edge of the sloping roof , stroked it like the neck of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studious voice , he said , " Now this is one thing will outlast you , a red cedar roof . " Rob came up beside him and also reached . He was shorter by a head , so only the tips of his fingers could touch the dry fragrant verge of Grainger 's work . Yet it seemed important to touch what he could of the substance which would silver through the next ten years , then begin to moss over but still turn water maybe fifty years from now when Rob Mayfield would be sodden or vanished ; to touch it not only to please Mr. Hutchins who was watching but to search in himself for the small coal ofp226serious hope uncovered by Polly and his father or put there by them . Rob found the coal and warmed it ; he would not lose it now . He lowered his arm and entered the springhouse before Mr. Hutchins , passed the round central font , and sat on the railing of the dark far side . Mr. Hutchins stayed out . Rob said , " I am after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Hutchins reached up again and patted his roof . Then he stepped inside and came on as far as the spring itself and stood behind that . " The roof before this one was put on in eighteen and seventy-three by my grandfather once he 'd figured the war was actually over and that people might start getting sick again . My mother was the main one he had in mind . She was his youngest daughter and had married my father , young Raven Hutchins , the previous year ; and they 'd moved here to live and help with what few guests still came . The worst guest was me . I came in the late fall of ' 72  --  November rains  --  and just about tore my mother to pieces . She was short and narrow . I was big from the start like my father 's people , and she stayed down in bed the rest of that winter . Then in spring when it looked like she still could n't strengthen ( and all my father could do was grieve  --  sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water might help her , make her think she 'd live . It had been boarded up since during the war when a young girl that refugeed here from Richmond caught the typhoid and died and her mother blamed the water ; she may have been right . I 've never claimed that it had anything to recommend it but wetness and sulphur ; if you 're dry or have got the itch or mange , it may help you some . Otherwise you 're better off drinking whatever you were drinking the Sunday you came here . Anyhow my grandfather had it cleaned out and tore down the old shed and built this new one , twice the size . And she did improve  --  my mother , strange to say . In a matter of weeks , she was out on the porch ; and by the time my clear memories begin , she was strong as you or me and stronger than my father . They worked on here to run the hotel . I grew up here ; only place I know , only place I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-horse operation , never more than ten rooms . We never doubted that  --  Warm Springs and Rockbridge Baths were right down the road  --  but we had a small number of elderly people who came every summer and rocked and talked , even drank a dipperful of this stinking water once or twice a day . Good for their bowels ; we had four johnnies . What they mainly came for was Mother 's good meals three times a day . Cooked and served by Mother  --  great tubs of fresh food , fresh bread and cakes  --  with nothing to help her but my sister Lou , and me to chop wood , and Della 's black mother ( the mountains were not strong on Negroes then ) . But they did have to struggle to get here like I said  --  catch the train to Hot Springs ; I 'd meet them in the wagon and haul them to here on that little road : it has stopped several hearts and no water would start them  --  and people these days are n't looking for struggles ; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , some mean old maids . I was grown by then and clerking dry goods for Wilson Hamlett . Grandpa had died . My own sorry father just sat on the porch and prayed for money ; what little we had was squeezed by Mother and me from odd drummers and the few summer guests . ( I helped her at night when I got home from work . We 'd sometimes scramble till one in the morning , turning mattresses or cooking . I 'd help her put up great bushels of food ; we worked smooth together . ) This spring here had come down to nothing but spiders , lizards all in it , big healthy snakes . And then I got married ; you know to who . She had grown up in Goshen way out by the river ( her people had come here to teach from east Virginia  --  Isle of Wight , near Suffolk ; good stock , big readers ) ; but we planned to move out of here when we could . I was planning to take any job God offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't offering  --  not in 1894 , not through the mails ( which is what I was trying : writing off for jobs )  --  so finally I decided to hunt in person . That meant telling Mother . I came down early one Saturdaymorning ( I had begged the day off ) , and she fixed my breakfast ( my wife was upstairs ) . She thought I was just going off to Hamlett 's , and I had decided to let her think it ; I told my wife , If you come down and tell Mother where I 've gone , I 'll leave you flat . ' But then she touched me  --  my mother , I mean . She was not a great toucher ; I do n't think she 'd touched me in oh nine years ; but she came up behind me that Saturday morning  --  nobody was with us  --  and carefully touched my head with her hands , parted my hair with her long tough fingers . It almost killed me ; food seized in my throat . I thought , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I kept my own counsel and prayed she would just go on with her cooking . Well , she finished my hair and moved her hands down to rest on my shoulders ; then still there behind me which did n't help a bit , she said , You feel like you 're leaving me. '  --  I 'm warm , ' I said ; Is that what you mean ? ' ( it was early June ) . No it 's not , ' she said . Then we both were quiet and still as old logs . Then somebody 's feet started coming downstairs  --  alady named Simpson from South Carolina ; from Mullins , I think . Mother said " Tell me quick . " So I swallowed my cold cud and told her , not looking , Yes ma 'm . We are hoping to move to Lynchburg . ' And back quick as voltage , she said Then damn you . ' But I went to Lynchburg . " Rob , in the dark behind the spring , thought Mr. Hutchins had only paused for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait , though he saw Mr. Hutchins was looking to him . Finally Rob said , " You went and she died ? " Mr. Hutchins stepped up and under the roof and came as far forward as the edge of the spring . " You figured that out or did Della tell you ? " " Rachel , " Rob said . " It 's true anyhow . " " Right away ? " Rob said.  | " No a year and a half . She waited that long . I got a job in Lynchburg , clerking again ; and we moved there in August . She never tried to stop me after that first time  --  wrote me letters every Sunday , sent me little gifts of food  --  and we came back here to visit at Christmas . Everything seemed the same . It was n't ; she was hiding , not her sickness maybe ( it may not have started ) but her misery surely . She was left alone . Father was there and Lou and the help , but it turned out they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one time before ; so she gave me the power to do it again , to finish what I started twenty-five years before . I finished it . We went back to Lynchburg , my wife and I ; and the following November when I came up here one Sunday for my birthday , I found her just about dead . No warning except that one little time like I said when she damned me . Advanced T.B .  --  really galloping consumption as the old people called it . Everybody knows , or knew back then before doctors ruled the world , that consumption was something you wished on yourself or at least welcomedin . She had made everybody else promise not to tell me ; so I walked in cold on the sight of her wasting . What it did was make me mad , at her and the others . I think I kept it from her ; but I felt it like gall in my mouth all that day , just pure damned mad that she 'd used me like that when all I 'd done was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had gone back on that ; it was her loved me . And I left again to prove it . It killed her by Christmas , six days before . The last thing she told me when I left that Sunday ( my birthday visit ) was You can come back now , just a few more days . ' I told myself I never would ; but after the funeral I could see my father was all caved in and would follow her soon . He had not known he loved her . He was left like a pissed-out bladder , that empty . I thought I would move back long enough to close this dump down and see Father through to his end  --  he was older than Mother , well on in his fifties and had a bad heart  --  and then sell all this and strike out again on my own plans . So back we came and here we are . It was Lou that died ; she had caught it from Mother . Father lived on till just before Rachel got sick , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths , I just gave up . You 've seen me here . " Mr. Hutchins waved round himself with both hands mildly . " I guess I stayed for Rachel . It is all she knew , she was always frail , I hated to move her . Now it 's harming her . " Rob said , " Then I offer to take her away . " " To where ? " " Maybe Richmond . I can get a job there much better than this one . My father will help me. " "  --  Teaching Negroes what ? What else do you know that Negroes can use ? " Mr. Hutchins was calm but his voice meant to damage . Rob laughed . " I thought you slept better than that . " " No I do n't . I 've heard every time  --  you creeping back here . Thank Jesus I have n't heard more than the creeping . "  | " Yes sir , " Rob said . Silence extended . Then he said , " I never heard you tell me to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I offered her to you , still offer her now . " " To keep me off Rachel ? I have not touched Rachel . " " I know that too . " " How please sir ? " Rob said . " Because Rachel 's happy . Rachel 's stronger every day . " Rob waited again , then was forced to say " I do n't understand you . " Mr. Hutchins said , " She really has n't told you ? " " No sir . I mean , she has mentioned Lynchburg , that doctor 's place . She says it was never her chest , just nerves . " " She was sick all over , " Mr. Hutchins said . " See , nobody claimed that place in Lynchburg was just for T.B . It 's a real hospital . I thought she had it ; and Dr. James here did , for what he 's worth  --  which is less than he charges ( he tended my mother and also Lou , watched them strangle ) . But everybody knew her nerves were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor but , as women 's health goes , she seems well to me . " Mr. Hutchins waited , then bent where he stood and lifted the round wood lid that covered the mouth of the spring . He reached above in the peak of the ceiling and found the great dipper  --  a yard long , copper  --  and stooped and carefully filled it with water . Then he walked to Rob and , still holding the handle , offered the drink . Rob accepted , set lips to the strong-tasting metal , and held the first draft from this spring on his tongue . A frightening presence within his own gates , old with minerals and rank with gas  --  poison or balm ? He could still spit it out and refuse its effects . But Mr. Hutchins stood above him , watching as keenly as if it were day and Rob were a message he could read with effort . Rob swallowed twice . Mr. Hutchins raised the dipper to his own face but stopped . He turned slightly sideward and threw out the few drinks Rob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark again and said , " I can thank you for saving her life . " Rob said , " Not I. I have just cheered her some . She has helped me as much . " Mr. Hutchins said , " And you swear Della has n't told you ? " " Della 's never said her name . " Mr. Hutchins sat on the edge of the spring . " Rachel lost her mind . Two years ago . She got the idea she was having a baby . Do n't ask me how . The doctors that looked said no man had gone near her ; she swore so herself . But she showed many signs of carrying a child for more than six months  --  the curse stopped in her ; she was violently sick but gained fleshp230steadily . To see her , you would think you had met a soul in torment , though she never claimed that . She would barely speak , and then just a word to Della or her mother . I went in one morning after maybe four months and tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which hung heavy on her  --  she had finished school ; she did n't have friends ) . I said did she have all the clothes she needed , meaning we could order her something nice . She nodded Yes three times and walked to the mantel and took up a tape measure , measured her waist right in front of me . Then she came close on me and said  --  fierce as you would say Die ! ' or Kneel ! '  --  This baby is coming here day by day and not one stitch in the whole house for it . It will perish bare . ' I said to her , Rachel , there is not any baby . You are tired and confused . But you 're also young  --  just relax now and rest ; do n't press on your mind . Then you 'll be yourself again and can get on with starting your life with those you love : " Rob said " Who were they ? " " Her mother and me , the whole place here . She was partial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " She was bound to be in love with somebody . " Mr. Hutchins thought it through . " She had had some school friends , a boy or two that came to see her , take her up on the mountain with a big crowd  --  picnics . But no love , no . I 'd have been the first to know . She 's a mystery to her mother , but to me she 's plain as print . We are hopeless close-kindred . " Rob said , smiling slightly , " Then she knew I was coming . " Mr. Hutchins said , " She may have . I sure to God did . " He stopped as if regretting it , then bowed to explaining . " I knew the night you got here she would love you soon . " Rob said , " She was still in Lynchburg then . " " She was . But I knew . " " How please ? " " I 've told you . She and me are close-kindred . She 's all I 've cared about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother worshipped me and I killed her for it , but I ca n't say I loved her . I had hurt her too much , from right at the first when I tore her so badly  --  you ca n't forgive that : that you tried to kill a woman and she lasted and loves you . My wife  --  well , you 've seen her ; she does what 's needed , does it quietly and well . But Rachel is a daughter . You can understand the rest  --  you were born , I trust ; and I know you 've had women  --  but you 've never had a daughter ; so you ca n't know till then . She is something you make in absolute pleasure with no work at all ; and she comes into life bearing half your nature  --  in some cases , more . Treat her gently and decently , she 'll turn to you like leaves to light before she can talk and tell you her care . By the time she 's a child  --  say , seven or eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I wonder is it luck or one more burden ? ) , she has turned into you . You and her are one thing . So back lastp231April , I saw you coming up my yard with Grainger ; and I knew you were hers . " Rob said " Can she have me ? " " When ? " " Oh end of summer . " Mr. Hutchins stood and closed down the lid of the spring . " Might as well , " he said . He turned , walked three steps toward the entrance ; then said , not looking back , " But kill her and I 'll find you wherever you are , make you pray to die . " Rob said " Yes sir . " August 23 , 1925 Dear Father , Yes , Mr. Bradley did take us through that part of the Aeneid . I could have told you about the meeting with Venus ; but as you suspected , I 'd mislaid the advice or never really heard it ( the way we were hauled through Vergil  --  kicking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the road  --  I 'm doing that , I guess , since I 'm building the road ; and it seems to aim at Richmond , eastward at least . I did n't plan on that . It was planned by the Commonwealth of Virginia . Looking back over my twenty-one years , I ca n't see that I have planned anything much . I hoped some things would happen  --  a life of long content  --  but until I was forced to pull up stakes in Fontaine this spring , I do n't think I did much to help them happen , unless it was to reach out and take somebody ( nobody I had hoped for anyhow ) . Even that pull-up was forced by Mother , as I tried to explain , and by Kennerly Kendal 's meanness of heart . Even my visit to you and Polly was planned by Grainger and urged by you which is not to say that I did n't enjoy it ( I did and am grateful ; please pass that to her ) . But now after five little months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God intended to last till judgment  --  in a job just two notches better than what any barebacked rockheaded fieldhand black as a stove could ask for and get ( and better me at ) : now I have done one thing on my own , Rob Mayfield has . I plan to be married . Nobody but me and the girl involved ; and the idea was mine , though I know it had crossed her mind once or twice . She is who I mentioned to you last Saturday when we had got back from the show and you 'd said , " Then who on earth will accompany you ? " Remember I named Aunt Rena and Sylvie and Grainger maybe . I was smiling , I think , to show I was joking ; but you did n't see that . You said ,  | " Think , Robinson . They are all your seniors ; they will die and leave you " ; and I 'd said " All right . " But once you 'd asked who would go with me , this name came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known her three months and had felt drawn to her by needs of her own ; I had even made some curious promises to her . So she did n't rise up from the blue that night just to answer you . But I did come straight back here Sunday evening , my mind made up , and asked her Monday morning and her father Tuesday night . We plan on being married here this coming Thanksgiving . My job lasts till then and Rachel needs the time ( she has been a little sick but is much improved ; three more months should do the trick ) . I invite you herewith to be present then . I also mean to ask Mother and Rena . I hope you will come . Then after that I hope to accept the job you mention in Richmond . You say it would be in the business office . I am pretty good at figures as I think I told you , so I guess I can do it or learn quick enough . Would you please let me know what letter I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make any deeper search you can into whether I will really get the job or not ? If I do n't maybe Grainger can . He would be the right shade and is no doubt as good at figures as me . In fact now I mention it , I spoke to Grainger on all these developments this afternoon , the November wedding and the Richmond job . He listened at first and wished me well ; but later on when I was asleep ( Sunday nap ) , he came to my room and let himself in when I did n't answer and woke me up and said would I need him once I 'd made those changes ? As I told you , he came here with me last April on the spur of the moment when I was bad off and in need of help : just shut up his house and came , clean and bare ( once he got the job here , he went back for two days and got a few belongings  --  the books you gave him  --  and moved some old woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came home , if ever ) . So in short I said I would . Need him , I mean . He said , " Then you 're asking me to come with you ? " I said I was , providing I went ; and he said " Does Mr. Forrest know ? " I said no you did n't but that I planned to write you a letter tonight . " Then ask him , " he said ; " ask him can I come . " My own quick plan was that we could use him  --  that is , Rachel and I. He is good in the house , and she will need help . So I told him that though you had kindly said that I could move in at the Mayfield place , I had tripled my numbers without warning you and thus would intend to find a small place of my own , room for him . He thought about that but still said again , " You ask Mr. Forrest does he want me to come . Then show me his answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so please answer . I thought I noticed some reservation on Molly 's part when I spoke of Grainger ; if there is , tell me now . And kindly answer soon . I am trying  --  do you see ?  --  just to proceed . I am making these plans now entirely on my own . If others ca n't bless them , then I 'll go on alone ;  |p233or  Rachel and I will . Clearly I hope you can bless and welcome this latest Mayfield who has only now started to learn what you promise my elders know . Thanks again to Miss Polly . I 'm waiting to hear . Your loving son , RobAugust 23 , 1925 Dear Mother , No word from down there for ten days now . Has the heat laid you out or has Rena 's hand withered ? I trust you are all there and upright and breathing or someone would have wired me . I think I am better than I 've been for some time ; and I hope that an explanation of why will give you maternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding in Goshen , Virginia sometime in late fall , most likely Thanksgiving . You can get here by train in under eight hours ; the days will be cool and the mountains in their beauty ; so I 'd like to see you here if your work at home permits . It goes without saying that the rest are invited if they all care to come  --  Kennerly and Blunt , Sylvie of course . I will write a special note to Rena after this . You would have a good seat , the clearest view available of Rob starting life  --  his life as you 've urged . The bride is Rachel Hutchins . I have mentioned her in past letters to you , I think . I know I have to Rena ; she expressed her pleasure and her usual warnings . In any case , her family own the hotel in Goshen where I have lived since April . They are people you could honor , have held this spot for years ( there 's a little mineral spring , not famous , not healing ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it some hundred years ago and have stayed right on ) . Rachel is in certain ways a likeness of you  --  not in looks or size but in having , like you , a death-grip on one single vision of life and of what she wants in it , and the courage and strength to seize out and hold it . Like you too she 's strained herself in the effort ; but she 's young , just twenty , and is in careful hands ( her parents ' lavish care ) ; and she thinks I am what life intends for her . I want to agree . She may be right . Once the wedding is over , my job here will end . After that I am planning to move to Richmond . I have hopes of bettering my outlook there  --  more money , cleaner work . It would be at the school where Father teaches . I have now met him , and he has offered to help me onto my feet . Of course I asked him to be at the wedding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , anything you have meant to me in the past or will go on meaning . Please understand that . You , if anybody , can . You are back of this . I had hoped to be able to beg a day off and get down to spend a weekend with you all ; but now with these plans , I will need to stay here.  |p234We  are also pushing the road extra hours to get our stretch finished before the fall rains . Please write to me soon , give me news of all , give love from me to all that would want it . Your effort f ul son , Rob Mayfield IITwo mornings later when they 'd finished breakfast and Eva had washed her father and shaved him , Sylvie helped her to walk him out into the yard and seat him in the shade ; then she went for the mail . Eva asked him a question or two about his comfort . Then he nodded off and she got to work on the last of the cutwork napkins she was making for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was months late as always ; but the girl should be grateful to get , any time , eight handmade napkins from kin she barely knew and cared less about . She was thinking that through  --  had almost decided to put them in a drawer and save them till someone she actually liked graduated or married : they would keep forever ; the cousin was ugly and would never use them  --  when her father spoke clearly . " I wonder where she went . " He frequently talked in half-dreams or stupors , and Eva seldom answered unless it was plain that he 'd asked her to . She worked on in silence , and he lapsed into what seemed certain sleep . But in less than a minute his chin kicked the air ; he fixed his eyes on her  --  she still had not noticed  --  and watched with a fierce intensity of waiting . His blue eyes never blinked . ' When she did not look , he said , " I begged you to tell me . " Eva turned and was startled but pretended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The heat 's blocked my hearing . " He worked to remember , then said with slow pain and the urgency of morning , " I asked you to tell me where she went . An easy question . You did not answer . " " Who , Father ?  --  Sylvie ? She 's gone for the mail and will no doubt take her time coming back . Rena 's indoors waxing the dining-room floor . " He sat awhile , eyes shut , as though that were his answer ; as though his need were as simple as that  --  had been purified by age and apoplexy to a dog 's need , a baby 's . Then he begged again . " Charlotte Kendal , my wife . Charlotte Watson , she was . " He had turned again on Eva . Eva felt she should touch his hand that was gripped to the arm of the chair , but his eyes refused her . She looked at her work and said " In Heaven , I trust . "  |p235He  said , " You do n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes sir . " " Did you ever know her ?  --  a Watson child , an orphan ? " Eva said , " Years later , well after she was grown . " " Too late , " he said , " long years too late . " " How is that ? " " I ruined her . I got to her early . " Eva said , " You loved her . Everybody knew that . " " She knew it , " he said . " All Hell knows she knew it ; if she 's anywhere , she 's there . But she also knows I harmed her . " " Her mother and father did that , Thad and Katherine . " Mr. Kendal 's face could no longer show feelings more various than rage , exhaustion or boredom ; so he watched her with what seemed sustainedfury still , though in fact it was honest surprise . " You knew them , did you ? " " No , Father , they were dead . You told us the story . " " Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul . " It had been Eva 's observation since her father had suffered two strokes that no good came of humoring his confusions  --  he would fly too far afield  --  so she said , " Sir , you did . I remember distinctly . You told it to Rena and Kennerly and me the night I went off with Forrest to Virginia . " Her voice had stayed calm ; she 'd worked at the napkin . She had not mentioned Forrest 's name to her father for maybe twenty years , eighteen at least . He had made it easy for her . " You are lying again . " " No sir . I have n't lied to you since that same night . " Two mentions of the night , blunt shocks to his chest , set him back on whatever narrow rails he possessed . He waited awhile . Then he said , " Well , thank you . I can thank you at least . " She was able to touch him , her right hand on his wrist , though she did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff hand palm-up on the chair . The move left her fingers on the crest of his pulse  --  a strong life , regular and harsh as cries . She bore it long moments ; then she reached farther down , and his fingers gripped hers . They sat like that all the time it took Sylvie to come from her laughing meeting at the corner , with Nan the Bradley 's cook , up the walk to them . Eva took back her hand to accept the mail . Sylvie stood beyond her reach and said , " You got you one from Rob . " Eva said , " I am glad you 're not all that he remembers . " She was smiling but , as Sylvie knew , the card that came from Richmond a few days before ( first word from Rob in August ) had gone down badly  --  intended for Sylvic . Sylvic stepped a little forward and surrendered the letter , then stood as Iva opened it . " I ) id he get back from Richmond ? "  |p236Eva  read a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sylvie . You 'll want to get those squash on for dinner . " Sylvie stood on awhile to show that she could ( Eva straightened the neck of her father 's robe ) . Then she said , " He telling you he ai n't coming back " and headed for the kitchen , muttering as she went  --  " Some people got sense . " Eva opened the letter and read it through quickly in the late morning sun that was finding its way through their thin screen of leaves . Her father did n't watch her , clamped his eyes and suffered the creepingglare ; but when he heard paper folding again , he said " When 's he coming ? " " Sylvie 's right ; he 's not . " " Need money ? " " No , Father . He is paid every week . He needs a wife apparently . This says he 's getting married . " Mr. Kendal did n't turn . Eyes shut , bare crown of his head assaulted by glare , he said " Read it to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice which many good ears could not have understood ; she knew her father could . When she finished , they sat in silence a moment ; then she said , " You are broiling , Father . Let me go call Rena and help you in . " He shook his head . " Sit still . " She sat and they waited another little while till he turned his eyes and slowly looked toward her . She bore his gaze as he searched her , merciless . Finally he turned back and faced the street again and said , " You were who I meant . " Eva needed to stop him now ; she could n't let him wander . She said " I 'm grateful " and moved to stand . " Sit still please , " he said . " Just obey me once more . I have meant to say this for some years ; but it slips my mind  --  you know my mind . " He paused , staring out as though the street held his message . " You were who I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disastrous smile which his age would permit . " Sir , I do n't understand . " He scratched at the air with one long finger , writing it for her . "  --  Who I meant just now . The one I ruined . " Eva smiled but did not speak , still plainly puzzled . " Your mother was responsible for all she did . She killed two people before herself . I loved her just the same . It was you I harmed . " Eva shook her head slowly . " I am begging your pardon . " She said , " Father , Mother was nothing but a child ; a baby just born . " " But she paid . Do n't you see ? " " She was unhappy , yes ; through no fault of yours . She explained that to me . Put her out of your mind . "  | " She 's out , " he said . " It 's you I 'm begging . " " I 've been happy , " Eva said . " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . " Her father said " Liar . " Eva said " Please do n't . " " All right , " he said . She stood and laid her work on the chair and called loudly , " Rena  --  " Quick , strong as a boy , Mr. Kendal reached out , ringed her wrist , pulled her toward him ( she managed not to stumble , to stand straight before him ) . He whispered now  --  " But you know my meaning ? " Eva said " I do " and knew that she did , saw clearly for the first time that he 'd given her her due and would leave now soon . She called again for Rena , pleading . Frvi hours later Eva sat on the porch alone , slowly swinging . Her father was asleep ; Rena had gone in search of a load of manure for her fall garden ; Sylvie was at home for her own short rest before cooking supper . At such a time Eva would normally have gone to her quiet room and shut the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved downstairs to the room behind his ; Rob had taken her room  --  but two things had forced her out to the porch : the heat indoors , stifling by four , and the need for a space between her and her father . Breathing space , to settle her mind and prepare her answers for the questions that would rush her from every side by tomorrow at the latest when Rena would get her own announcing letter from Rob ( she had so far told no one except her father and had managed , last moment , in the yard to warn him  --  " Do n't mention Rob 's marriage . It would ruin Rena 's day " ) . But alone and quiet in the hot little wind she could raise by swinging , she found that her old devices for calm had also left her  --  she could not shut her eyes and by force of will flush her mind clean and blank , she could not pray that Jesus stand by her with strength , could not say a poem to herself , hum a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total knowledge , the sum of her life , both pitifully meager and pressingly huge , crowding all else aside  --  You are being abandoned . Father miserable and dying ; Rob gone in condemnation but heaping coals of kind fire now on her head ; Forrest barely present in her memory even , much less in her hope ( she had no picture of him , had never had ; only Rob 's growing image , an innocent mimic ) . She was left with Rena and Sylvic , coal-black . It seemed to her  --  for the first time now ( she had never considered the blame till now , having never been alone )  --  entirely her fault . What the present weight of omen saved her thinking or recallingp238(she 'd dreamt it clearly twenty years before ) was the fact that she 'd willed the choices of her life , the company she 'd had , and had lived in what any sober witness might have called unusual happiness . The life she had wanted . It was quitting her now with the suddenness of death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps , down the stone walk , aware that for the first time in sixteen years she had left her father entirely unattended . A cry would reach her though ; she was walking nowhere , only stirring the heat . She stopped at the end of the walk , at the road , and crouched and began to weed Rena 's bed of zinnias . It had been a wet August , and Rena had been busy in the back with her vegetables . As Eva worked she knew that Rena would notice ( " Some rabbit was down at my flowers today " ) ; but she worked on delicately , harming nothing . When she finished she had a little stack of hay beside her . She 'd walk to the sideyard and put it round the roses ; but rising quickly in the heavy sun , she tottered . Dizzy blood flooded her sight . She sat backward hard , to keep from falling . She was in plain view of the road  --  any passer  --  with her dress caught high on her folded calves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but she did not look out to check for passers : she did not care . She cared for herself , the small dry room in the front of her skull where her bare self lived ; had happily lived these thirty-eight years , give or take a bad hour and the year with Forrest . The room had been light ; and though the one door opened outward only , it had let her move freely to the few destinations she required and loved . Vanishing and no substitutes in sight . The room itself darkened , the air brown and close , the one door sealed . Eva thought she would weep ; tears were all in her throat , at the backs of her eyes . While she waited for tears , she searched for when she had really wept last . Mag 's funeral maybe , six years before ?  --  not that Mag had ever quite welcomed her back when she 'd come home with Rob or in all the years after ; but she could n't remember a later time . And she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came . Still unsure of standing , she looked down and saw she had landed on the name-stone , a small granite wheel from a disused mill on her father 's river place . He had hauled it here when Eva was seven or eight and sunk it in the walk among smaller stones . It had been late summer  --  school had still not begun  --  and Kennerly had come out next morning with a chisel and hammered K.K. very neatly in the granite , on the edge of the hole . It had taken him till noon ; she and Rena had watched him . When he 'd shaped the last serif , he 'd moved round and started on an R for Rena , who was youngest and could barely make her letters on paper , much less in stone . Eva had watched till he started on the curve that proved it an R , not an E. Then she 'd said , " I am going in the back to play with Sylvic . When you finish with Rena , I want to do my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p239This  is granite . " Still he 'd called when he finished ; and once they 'd eaten dinner , she had chiseled at her own E.K. for hours . Smaller than the others and listing to the right but there in its proper place beside the great socket . And there still . She traced it with a finger now . The simple touch , rough and dry , proved the channel she 'd needed . But no tears came ; only a retching in her throat which she did not try to strangle . She yielded to all its awfulness . A shameful release in August glare not three yards short of the public road . She did not hear the steps behind her , would still not have cared . " Mrs. Mayfield ? " Eva turned  --  Min Tharrington , frightened above her . Eva nodded . " You caught me . " " Not soon enough . Are you hurt anywhere ? " " Yes , " Eva said . " But nothing you can help . " Her vertigo had calmed ; she stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " " I just came to say goodbye . " " That 's no help at all . Anybody can leave . " Eva stroked back her hair with both hands blindly . " Your school has n't started . Why leave so early ? " " Brother 's taking me to Raleigh this Saturday . My principal has found me a room near the school with a satisfactory widow ; but Mother has insisted that Brother go and check so Saturday 's the day . " " Luck to you , Min . You 've earned it at least . " Stronger each moment , Eva made no move toward the house or porch . Min waited a moment for an invitation ; then said , " Could we sit down a minute , if you have a minute ? " " To be sure , " Eva said . " Just let me check on Father . " They climbed up and Min sat while Eva went in ( her father still asleep ) and combed her hair . When she came back , she brought two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke . At last Eva said , " This has been hard on you . I can see it has . " She looked to the brown-haired girl beside her , calm in a yellow dress  --  a grown woman leaving . " Not really , " Min said . " I was scared you had fallen . " " Oh that , " Eva said . " I sat to keep from falling , sun on my brain . No I meant your plans . " " Well , I 've got this degree , four years in the galleys . I might as well use it . " Eva nodded . " So right . " Then she finished her water . " But you had to fight your mother . I meant that part . " " Did Mother tell you that ? " Eva smiled . " Several times . I was on your side and I told Kate so . " " Thank you , " Min said . " I suspected as much . She never said a wordp240to me against it  --  did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something  --  but of course I felt her grudging every step of the way . " " She 's a mother , " Eva said . " Do n't blame her too much . You 've made little things in your life too , all those good grades , your clothes , your pictures . Someday you 'll make a child . " " Maybe not , " Min said . " With that hair of yours and deep green eyes ? Try to stop it , " Eva said . " And when you 've made it and seen it through the years , not days or weeks ; when you honestly wanted to push it out the window or prayed it would melt like a salted snail , then you 'll understand . " " I understand now ; I 've loved somebody . " " I know you have , know it very well . But it 's not love I mean , though it may include love . It 's ownership . You want what you 've made ; it 's familiar easy company . " Min @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard ? " " This morning , " Eva said . She decided that instant  --  she would keep her own counsel ; she would not risk telling . " He is doing very well , working hard , sounds healthy . " " Will they work up there in the mountains through winter ? " " I doubt it , " Eva said . " Will he come back here ? " " To visit at least . He misses Sylvie ! " " But he 'll keep the road job ? " Eva searched Min 's face ; then laughed , " You ask him . You 're his friend . I 'm his mother ; boys tell their mothers very little . " Min said , " In that case we 'll neither one know . " " I thought you two were in regular touch . " " No ma 'm . I have not touched Rob in four years . " Eva laughed . " He would n't mind . " Min nodded firmly . " He would . He knows I want him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " " How do you know , Min ? " Any edge on Eva 's voice , of harm or raillery , had yielded now to real curiosity . Min heard that , agreed to answer the truth . " I 've thought about very little else for four years . He 's all I want . " " Did you ever tell him ? " " He knew , " Min said . With a quick flood of pleasure , Eva thought Me in him . But she held back the smile that would naturally have followed . " God help you , " she said . Min waited . " I do n't understand , Mrs. Mayfield . " Eva said , " I 'm not sure I do myself . Maybe something like this  --  it is built into him , in the mortar joints , to run from being held . Ile came by it rightly . "  | " How so ? " " From his mother . " Eva did smile now . " I 'm a runner . I have run all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No ma 'm , I have n't . " " My marriage , Min . I 'm sure you 've heard . It was quite the topic . " " But before I was born . I 've heard a few stories . I did n't pay attention . " " Do , " Eva said . " They are worth your time , I honestly believe . " Min waited as though the stories would follow . Eva said , " When I was sixteen and had just finished school , the night before commencement , I got up off that stoop right there and walked through this house and out the back door to marry in secret a man almost twenty years older than me , who had been my teacher . For two reasons only , as far as I can see , and I 've looked for reasons  --  I thought I was unhappy living with my mother ( I was far from her favorite ; we were too much alike ) ; and I thought that no honor would ever come to me like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his : for life as you say . " Eva stopped as if that were the story , told . Min said " Were you right ? " Eva looked to her , baffled . " Did a better honor come ? " She had never thought it out . She did , quickly now . Then she shook her head . " Never . " It made her smile . " Of course I have only lived half my life . I 've barely begun . Earth lies all before me ! " " But you 're sorry for the past ? " Eva saw that Min pressed her from need not malice ; so she said , " What part ? There are terrible parts  --  my mother , Rob 's birth . " "  --  That you came home here . Never saw your husband . Mother said you have never seen him again . " Eva nodded . " Never . August the third , nineteen hundred and four . The length of your life , and a little more . " She paused to think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sorry ? " Min said . " What right do you have ? " Eva said it as calmly as " Another glass of water ? " "  --  That you started to tell me , that you 've known me all my life , that you see as clear as anybody why I need to know . " Eva shut her eyes . " All right . " She leaned her head back on the chair 's white wicker and spoke from there as if from a distance or the wisdom of sleep . " I was not sorry then ; there was too much to do , the turmoil here after Mother 's death , Rob 's case of whooping cough , Father 's pitiful state . When when they began to ease , I found I believed one thing above all  --  Mr. Mayfield had picked me for reasons of his own which he did n't understand ( and Cod knew I did n't ) . Ile thought of my reasons no more than you 'd think of the wishes of a warm egg you take from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does . So sitting here in that first year or two , I thought that at least my wish was not him , not Forrest Mayfield . I thought that I just wanted something to do  --  the kitchen was held down by Mag and Sylvie , the house ( and more than half of Rob ) by Rena ; Father was active at his farms and in timber . So I gave voice lessons . I had a sweet voice and knew how to use it . I thought I could pass time in that useful way  --  please God , make some money , and beautify the air ; but the pupils did n't care . Nothing on earth is worse than bad singing ; I 'd rather hear tin scrape tin any day . I stopped in a year and sat here awhile . Then I wrote to my husband  --  or sent him our picture , Rob 's and mine . A stone would have wept . Not a word of reply . He was living in Richmond by then , teaching Negroes . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we exchanged Christmas greetings for several years , the sister and I. He had a housekeeper that had worked for his father . Their family home . That was eighteen years ago . He 's still there , I think . I have been to Richmond twice in that time  --  once with your mother shopping ( up at dawn , back at dark ) ; once with Sylvie to look into me taking courses from a correspondence college to teach grade school  --  but he never crossed my path , and I was n't out to hunt him . I was leaving it to fate , and fate left me here ! " Eva waited , smiling . She had seen Sylvie far down the road ; coming onward in the heat , no hat , no shade . She would grumble all evening . Min said , " What happened to your plan to teach school ? " Eva turned . "  --  Father . He had his first stroke . He was all I could do . Has been ever since . " She stopped again ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The answer is , you 're sorry for it all ? " " I was n't , no . But I may be soon . " " Then please , " Min said  --  she leaned to say it  --  " Please tell me why you thought I should hear that . " Eva said , " I suspected it was not in your books , not taught in college . Postgraduate instruction . No charge at all . " She smiled and waved to Sylvie , who did not wave back . " Do you think I 'm a fool ? " " In what ? " Eva said . " Leaving home . That job . " " No , " Eva said . " You have got to pass time . Your family live forever ; you 're a babe in the womb . " Min said " Forget Rob . " Eva laughed . " Please explain . " " You are telling me , Forget about Rob ; go your way : " Knowing all she knew , with no intent to harm , Eva said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can . " Her left hand had reached through the heat toward Min ; Min had not reached to take it.  |p243Sylvie  called from the end of the porch by the palm , " What Rob say today ?  --  that letter I brought you . " " Said he 's happy , " Eva said . " Sent his love to you . " September 13 , 1925 Dear Alice , I 've held off answering till I knew what I felt and if that was what I meant and then whether I would be able to say it . What I mainly feel is puzzlement that you step forward now with objections to Rob  --  you say reservations but objections is the word  --  when you liked him here and wrote me to say so . I trusted that you had been telling the truth , and I really continue to think that you were . I can only explain your turn in this way  --  in your first letter after your visit here , you were praising a surface . He was making it lovely ; he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a natural thing to praise . I surely do n't deny that he has lures and snares all over him . The first time I mentioned him to you , I seem to recall waxing big on his face . He still has the face ; and now you warn me against it  --  " Those eyes will go on inviting people in , and the people will come . . . He is not looking outward any farther than his lashes . . . He is built for harm . " No doubt he is ( I know I am . I have kept two people in misery for years , and I may not stop ; I may add more ) ; but if what I honestly believe I know about why human beings choose to follow each other is true at all , then whether he is hateful as a Hun on horseback or gentle as a pastry cook is no concern of yours or even of mine and his . This is what I believe , seems all I believe these recent weeks ; and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are grown in good control of their bodies and minds , who are not being forced by parents or a baby or either party 's money or anything other than their own heart 's speaking , will contemplate spending the whole of their two lives beneath one roof ( whatever time holds for them and the roof ) for one reason only  --  they want each other . They also suspect and may even believe that want is need and will always be , but here as in other ways the mercy of time is their only hope . Rob thinks he needs me . He has said so directly on numbers of occasions to me and to others  --  my father for instance ( my father trusts him ) . I have every reason to believe he is in fair control of his faculties ( Jesus drank at times ) . I deeply believe I am in control of mine  --  partly through your help , your father 's , partly Rob 's . I also believe , and I 've thought it through asp244sternly as a judge thinks a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited on others were not true diseases but symptoms of an illness in no book known to me or your father  --  some strange starvation in the core of the heart for which no one but time can prescribe , if time ever does . I believe it has for me . I would be the one to know , the heart being mine . Of course he has faults . I know them better than you , better than any other woman in Virginia . I know he 's needed pieces off of other human beings ( with him , needing is taking )  --  I know more there than he thinks I know , having good night-vision  --  but I 'm the only person that he 's asked for all of ; and I 'm giving it all two months from now . He knows my faults in honest detail ; Father told him in advance . I 'm giving it for three very simple reasons that are both entirely scary and the sole consolation I have found to date  --  he 's asked , I wanted him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us both  --  or him or me or some unborn , unthought-of , consequence  --  but so might the beefsteak we ate for supper , the breath I 'm drawing as I write this line . I asked you to bless us as my Maid of Honor , and I ask you again . If you wish us well , can stand there behind us and watch the joining and wish it well , come . I say well in every sense  --  good luck , good healing , fresh water in our deeps . If you do n't , if anything in you says stay , then for God 's sake stay . Whichever you choose , be always certain that my present hard feelings will in no way cancel my grateful memory of the strong warm care you offered me before when I was prone to die . My memory has always been my perfect trait . Till I hear then , Love fromRachelp245NOVEMBER 1925MR . Hutchins rose at the head of the table , leaned far forward , and turned up the wick of the hanging brass lamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ; so now the whole room was brighter than warm ( the iron stove beside him was stoked but barely drawing , and the evening was cold ) . Then he stood in his own place and thumped his waterglass for attention . It rang , high and pure , and everyone turned . He said , " As the proud host of all of this , I get the first word . But since I 'm a mountaineer and paying for the oil "  --  he gestured to the five lamps  --  " I ' 11 make it just a word ; everybody please copy . The word is glad . I am yielding a daughter that I love like myself to a boy that I trust will know her needs and struggle to tend them . He 's a worker ; the Robertses can swear to that , their job being finished here a week ahead of schedule  --  " The two Roberts boys , twelve feet away toward the foot of the table , nodded smiling . They were too dark to see. "  --  She also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother 's and all her strong ancestors ' ) , has big gifts to give . A feeling heart . Miss Kendal , Mr. Mayfield , I think I can say with no fear of lying , and no intention surely , that all our families have made a good swap and stand to show a profit from what we 're here to do . " Mr. Hutchins stopped , thought a moment , had said his full say . " Mr. Mayfield , " he said , " the boy 's proud father  --  I take it you 're proud  --  your good word please . " Also dark at the far end , at Rachel 's mother 's right , Forrest half-rose long enough to say , " Mr. Chairman , yes , proud . I defer to Miss Rena . She has done all the work . " He looked up to Rena , met her firm clear eyes . Neither of them smiled but they both nodded grave and mutual acknowledgmentof parts played , honors earned . Rena kept her seat but took a long drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she spoke of course to Rob . " Thank you , " she said . Rob was opposite her , four feet away . Ile kissed the back of his ownp246right hand and turned it to her slowly . Another gift . Everyone sat in silence till she took it  --  the gift not his hand . She threw her head back and laughed a high short cry ; it came down smiling and everybody clapped . Mr. Hutchins said , " Are you done , Miss Kendal ? " " I 've said my word . " " You can have several more since you 've come such a way . " Rena shook her head , then thought , then looked to Mr. Hutchins . " I 'll speak for his mother . " " Please do . " She looked to Rob . " Eva sends you a world of luck and her love . " Rob said , " She could have brought it . " His voice sounded happy but he 'd said it all the same . " But she did n't , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Please say a little more . " Rachel sat in front of Forrest , so he said it to Rachel . " You know this boy at least as well as I do  --  this man , he is . You 've really known him longer , though I saw him for a while at the very beginning of his life . Yesterday ! It has brought me tremendous happiness since summer , that he hunted me down and offered me a bond where I had no right to expect anything but continuous parting . He has also found you . From your eyes and joy , I can guess you believe you have found him too . I am trusting you have , and I 'll offer such prayers as I pray to that end . It would be a great victory , for our family at least and  --  and if I might have your permission , Miss Rena  --  for his mother 's as well . " Rena 's eyes never flickered off Forrest 's face , however far away ; but she gave no sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You will have the harder job . He 's halfMayfieldand will not like pain . But he 's also half-Kendal ; and as all here can see at this table tonight in good lamplight , the Kendals are lovely and invite us to follow . " He nodded toward Rena . " The Watsons , " Rena said . She smiled at Rob , then returned to Forrest . " My mother was a Watson ; it was them that people followed  --  my father , you . I 'm a Kendal . Kendals follow ; here I am today . " Forrest laughed  --  all did  --  and concluded for Rachel , " There 's part of your job  --  sort out who he is . And you 'll likely find he 's many . Then love all you find . " He found his eyes were filling and turned to Rachel 's father . " If this were drinking country , we could drink to their health . " Mr. Hutchins said " We can . " He looked to his wife . " We are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Kendal , would you drink a glass of old mountain brandy ? " " Very gladly , " Rena said . Mr. Hutchins nodded to his wife , who rang a bell . Everybody sat silently as if on a train and heard steps come quickly toward them from the kitchen  --  Grainger at the door , smiling like a guest . Mr. Hutchins said ,  |p247'Go  down in the cellar past all the preserves . You 'll find a gray jug that says Raven in blue  --  my given name , my father 's before me " ( that was offered to Rena ) . " Bring me that and ten glasses . " Grainger said " Yes sir . Everything else fine ? " " Very nice , yes thank you . " " Mr. Rob , you holding up ? " Grainger pointed to Rob . " Sinking fast , " Rob laughed . " Bring the jug here quick . " Grainger said " On the way " and turned to go . Mrs. Hutchins said , " Grainger , while you do that ask Gracie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And a pitcher of water , " Rob said . " From the spring . Could we please have that ? " Grainger looked to Mr. Hutchins . Mr. Hutchins laughed and nodded . But Rachel said , " Do n't . Well-water please . You 'd kill the guests . " Mr. Hutchins said , " Well-water then for all , but do your errand first . " Grainger said " A gray jug " and went to find it . Forrest watched him out of sight and listened to his steps ; then he turned to Alice by him and said , " I believe you have known Rob awhile ? " Alice said , " Since summer . Just three , four months . " Forrest said , " As I told you , that 's longer than I. " Alice said , " Then you have a lot to look forward to . " Forrest said , " I hope I do . You really think I do ? " Alice sat on his right ; he had spoken to her softly , requesting an answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond Wirt Roberts , who was still eating loudly . " They 'll be living near you . I meant you 'd be close and would have time to know him . " " Would you trust him ? " Forrest said . " With what ? " " Your life , something serious as that . " Alice said , " I am trusting him with Rachel 's at least . " " That 's easy , " Forrest said . Alice said , " I doubt that . I 'm her Maid of Honor . I will march down tomorrow in the presence of the Lord and say I approve what the Lord is asked to bless . " Forrest shook his head . " You wo n't have to speak a word . " " I will be there though ; speech enough for me . " A tall dark girl had entered during that and came first to Forrest 's left and stood  --  the plate of ham . All the previous serving had been done by Grainger ; and since Forrest had got here only an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had not had a chance to visit the kitchen . He looked up at the girl now and said " You 're Grainger 's Gracie . " " Gracie , " she said and shook the dish slightly , a final offer . He served himself a slice . " We 'll be seeing you in Richmond . "  | " If you seeing quick , " she said . Forrest tried to search her face , as fine as a hand in its power and concealment , the eyes huge but narrowed , the mouth smiling inward . " Serve Miss Alice , Gracie . " Mrs. Hutchins moved her on . Then Grainger was back with a large round tray , the jug and the glasses . He set it on the sideboard behind Mr. Hutchins and said , " You going to pour it or me ? " Mr. Hutchins said " You " and went on talking to Rena and Rob . Only the two Roberts boys were silent and Forrest who had pushed his chair back a little to watch Grainger work , five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as carefully as if he had transmuted water itself for these guests ( empowered by the day , his part in its slow and happy unfolding ) , these few strangers held by a brief common purpose in their contrary lives , and would offer it now with grace sufficient to the night , the coming day . Mrs. Hutchins asked a question . But Grainger held Forrest ; he did not even face her . Then half his job done , Grainger lifted his tray again and went straight to Rena , who accepted her glass and smiled and told him " Thank you , " her only words to Grainger . Grainger chose to answer , whispered in the midst of six conversations ; but Forrest heard him clearly . He said " I 'm glad " and moved on to Niles Fitzhugh beyond Rena , Rob 's best man tomorrow . Forrest stood where he was and said , " My heart is very full . Mr. Hutchins , before I drink your brandy , may I say a word more while my head is still clear ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . This stuff looks mighty . " Rachel said , " Very mighty . Mr. Mayfield , speak . " Mr. Hutchins said " Quick . " Rena clapped ; the others followed . Grainger rounded the table . Forrest said , " I am fifty-five years old this month . Never say Time flies ' ; it has seemed like forever . But things have come at intervals to lure me on , make me still yearn to last ; things I now trust were sent , not accidents of time . This evening and the morning that awaits us are such things  --  of a beauty and hope which nobody present ( this is bald presumptionbut I 'll wager its truth ) had any right to plan for , dream for , expect . Not Miss Rena , if I may , whose own good home has been troubled for decades by onslaughts of anguish as hard as any on mine or me . Not Robinson my son or Rachel his bride , whose beauty of form and spirit and laughter were no guarantee that life would prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often drawn nothing but the envy of fate , its sour grim grin . If I were the genius I once pined to be , I could paint you in words the face of my father , of Miss Rena 's mother ( Rob 's Kendal grandmother ) , both lovely as daylight , both wrecked by time  --  "  |p249Through  that , Grainger quietly served all the others ; then came back and stood five feet behind Forrest with the one last glass . In the pause he offered the tray , not looking at Forrest 's eyes ( because of Forrest 's lateness , they had still said no more than ten words of greeting over platters of food ; their first real meeting in twenty whole years was before them , if ever  --  the drawn scars of love and rupture untested ) . Forrest reached for the full glass , let Grainger step back and turn toward the door ; then continued , "  --  Not Grainger who has been with my people , been one of my people , since his early boyhood : since before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced him at last . " You did not plan this , did not even dream it , that first day in June twenty-one years ago when you brought me good news of Rob and his mother that proved bitter lies  --  surely not . Am I right ? " Grainger said , " No sir . I thought it would end some way like this . " " You were twelve years old  --  " Grainger laughed . " N'mind . I still wanted things . Course , I doubted them since . No more . Not tonight . " He stood quiet a moment , then knew he must go . He reached for the gray jug and set it on the floor by Mr. Hutchins ' feet . Mr. Hutchins said , " Go back , get three more glasses , and come in here with Della and Gracie . " Grainger said " Yes sir . " As he went , Forrest sat and , after brief silence , talk began again  --  the hum of waiting . Rachel leaned toward Forrest . " I 'm on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God knows , I did n't ; did n't know day from night for weeks on end . But I always hoped . I 've thought just lately that hope was my trouble . I wanted all this , all Rob is giving ; and I strained so hard to hope it into being that I almost ruined it . I thought I could n't wait . Most children are hopeless ; they think they are trapped and will always live in whatever misery they feel that instant . I was living for this . " She smiled a little fiercely and looked to Alice . " Tell Mr. Mayfield I 'm really not lying . " Alice said " No she 's not . " Forrest said , " I believe you . The failure was mine . " Mrs. Hutchins touched Rachel on the back of her long hand . " Eat your supper , darling . What you still need is strength . " Rachel said , " I am stronger than anybody here . I 've lived through my life . " " It 's not over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate  --  chicken , ham , corn pudding , green beans , stewed tomatoes , chow-chow , a buttered roll . Grainger entered again with the same large tray  --  three glasses , the same kind  --  and Della and Gracie . Della still gave off the heat of cooking ;
