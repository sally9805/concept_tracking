txt " Only a few cities - Chicago , Philadeldelphia , New Yolk , Boston ? have kept the structures built by immigration , have retained the real ethnic blocs that support the whole fabric of those communities . Boston 's strengths come from those neighborhoods with roots , tradition and history . They are also enclaves that resist change . " His eyes reddened with fatigue , Mayor K2 ' ' n H. White was talking of the neighborhoods , the sources of " both the strengths and weaknesses " of this tense and troubled city . The Mayor was in the sofabed-equipped hideaway behind , his deskless City Hall office , ( necktie loosened under his J. Press pinstripe suit . Far off , on the neighborhood streets , there were feelings of anger , fear and resentment . In tough , largely Irish bluecollar South Boston , the mood was summed up in the word painted in large neat letters on one of the neighborhood 's clubhouses : " Resist . " In black Roxbury , where the boarded-up stores and abandoned buildings stretching along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that community 's poverty , powerlessness and problems , there was fear among black parents who want troops to protect their children . And there was anger in the crowds of black youths stoning and beating passing white motorists from the drab housing projects ? in revenge , they said , for a white mob 's attack on a black man in South Boston . For four weeks now , haggard city officials , community workers and the police have been trying to cope with the racial tensions that have flared into scattered violence under a Federal court-ordered plan of busing to achieve school integration . The tensions are the product of years of history and politics . In 1965 , when , at the height of the Southern civil rights movement , a local minister was slain in Alabama , the state legislature passed the Racial Imbalance Act , mandating that no school could be more than halfblack . Antibusing Platform In Boston , the law gave rise to what is called " School Committee politics . " Candidates runfling for the School Committee , which is independent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , won their posts ) by appealing to the white , neighborhoods on an antibusing platform . It was on the School ! Committee that Mrs. Louise Day Hicks , now a City Council ; member , first became prominent . The current chairman , the ; salty-tongued John J. Kerrigan , , is an outspoken foe of busing . Each year , state legislators ; from South Boston led the fight for repeal of the law , , which was supported by suburban liberals . This spring , Gov. , Francis W. Sargent declined to veto the repeal bill . But Federal District Judge : W. Arthur Garrity , ruling last June , on a longstanding sui brought by blacks , ordered th plan put into effect . He foun that the School Committee , had fostered segregation by such , devices as " tracking " blac and white students into separate schools . The plan was drawn up by , the state education authorities after the School Committee declined to draw up its own plan or provide information . Plan Called ' Terrible ' At the time , Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state plan , and many of those most actively involved now in trying to implement it describe it privately  --  and some publicly  --  with such words as " terrible . " The most controversial part , of the plan links South Boston , and Roxbury in a sprawling school district whose high school has one building in Roxbury and three in South Boston. , The black leadership in the city , trying to hold itself together publicly , is reluctant to back down from its commitment to integration . Many or the leaders , such as Paul Parks , the Model Cities director , andl Mrs. Ellen Jackson , who organized a program called " Exodus " in the nineteen-sixties in which the community raised money to hire its own buses to take children to better , white schools , have been fighting for integrated quality education for a decade . And , for many of the black leaders , the bottom line is simply " green follows white " ? the feeling that money and good teaching will come only into schools where there are whites . The blacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given new equipment this fall before the white students arrived . But many black parents have simply been afraid to send their children into hostile South Boston , where the buses have been met with stones and jeers , and the black attendance there has been low . Even in the Roxbury building of the high school , the black attendance has been about half that expected and less on many days . Many of the meetings that Mayor White and other city officials have held with black parents and leaders have been marked by cries of fear for the safety of the children and demands for troops for protection . But for many younger blacks the tensions inside and outside the school in resentment over the stoning of their buses spilled over into the widespread stonethrowing street battles of the last two days . " They say they want revenge , " observed Isaac Graves , the lean , black Little City Hall manager in Roxbury who has been working the streets to restore calm . " I tell them do n't go down there , the police are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you wo n't pick up a rock , get out . " To the blacks , the School Committee is a major symbol of what they see as a city machinery dominated by the Irish , leaving them with little room for advancement . " Village School Downtown , " a book by Peter Schrag on the Boston school in the mid-sixties that portrays an intransigent , Irishdominated , highly politicized system , reads as if it was written yesterday . Patronage Positions The unpaid school committee is a product of a turn-of-thecentury " Yankee reform " designed to keep the schools out of politics and the Irish out of power . Teachers buy tickets to the committee members ' fundraising dinners , and jobs for janitors and truant officers , along with equipment contracts , are patronage plums . A post on the committee is often a stepping stone to other political offices . In white South Boston , the busing plan is viewed as a plot , fostered by suburbanites , the news media and elected officials who send their children . to private schools , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voluntarily . In a sense , it is seen almost as a renewal of the struggle between the Protestant Brahmins and the Irish that has marked much of the history of Boston politics . There is a feeling among the Irish that the Yankees have done them in again and are shoving the blacks down their throats . Isolated Neighborhoods The neighborhoods here are highly isolated . Several blacks who moved here from other cities recalled being told by black friends not to go at night into the North End , an Italian area , and never to go to " Southie . " For whites , the isolation has meant that blacks are viewed primarily in terms of crime and deterioration of the neighborhoods . Now , the sense of " turf " of the ethnic neighborhoods is being challenged by the school busing problem . The other night , State Representative Bill Ownes , who is black , was on television with other members of the Black Caucus appealing for troops , and at one point he said , " We will walk in Southie , we will work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When I heard that , " one of the women in the South Boston information center was saying the other day , " I wanted to jump right into the television set and grab him by the throat . " In South Boston there is what has come to be called the " Belfast mentality , " the feeling that the community is under occupation by the police . And , in South Boston , too , the local politicians are maintaining their opposition to busing , with many elected officials leading last week a parade there at which State Senator William M. Bulger drew cheers when he cried , " This is not a battle for the faint of heart ? and the enemy can go straight to hell ! " Much of the hostility in South Boston has been directed at the presence of the Police Tactical - Patrol Force , which smashed up a bar and beat patrons on Saturday night . Three members of the force were beaten outside the bar the previous night , and many sources , familiar with both South Boston and the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retaliation . The Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into the incident . superintendent Joseph Jordan , the ranking officer on the police force , played football at " Southie High , " and many of the men on the tactical force and other units are from SOoth Boston or have relatives there . On Monday , when Deputy Superintendent Charles V. Barry saved a black man from an angry mob , his cousin , a patron of the bar , was arrested fight-. ing with the police . And as the police cleared the street that day , a man on the sidewalk said , " There 's Tommy Sullivan . He used to play ball here , " and then began picking out other men . On the first day that the black students at South Boston High came running and shouting out of the building , like students everywhere , the jaw , of the district police commander directing the ? bus loading dropped . " My God ! " gasped Capt . Arthur Kattigan , " I went to that school ! "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
