During the fuel shortage four years ago , the federal energy boss , John Sawhill , tried to persuade men to take off their neckties : it would cool them down a degree or two and save on power for air conditioners . The Sawhill movement , intelligent for reasons besides conservation , vanished faster than a Nehru suit . The men 's neckwear lobby protested , and Sawhill backed down . Well , fellas , he said , just loosen your ties . But the look he proposed was wrong anyhow . When a businessman in full regalia removes only his tie ( retaining the dark shoes , the suit , the shirt buttoned at the wrists ) , then he looks like a sharecropper-or an executive being held by terrorists . Something is missing . <P> Still , Sawhill was thinking in the right direction . The necktie-that vestigial bib , that morning noose-is a strange and sinister article of clothing . When a man feels ill , the first thing to do is loosen his tie ; it is , after all , pressing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brain . Practically , the necktie is as supererogatory as those little belts and buckles that used to adorn the backs of men 's trousers . The tie has no function except to clean eyeglasses , and even that it does badly . It makes as much sense as the grenade loops on a trench coat , or perhaps even less , since the man in the trench coat can at least carry grenades if he wishes . <P> But it would be wrong to say that the tie is useless or pointless . Dress is language . The tie has many meanings , many symbolic and psychological uses . It is an inverted exclamation mark hanging from the throat . It subtly directs attention away from the wearer 's physicality . Worn with full business suit , it can be a form of armoring , a defense and an assertion of power . It can also be a gesture of compliance . White House Aide Hamilton Jordan , tieless and amiably scruffy for years , has started dressing ( almost contritely ) in suit and tie in the wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tie is a uniform signaling solidarity among certain kinds of men , a semaphore announcing that " we all speak the language . " It gives men a feeling of security , a certain formality , a necessary distance . Although the tie may be physically uncomfortable , they take psychic comfort from it . <P> Ties differentiate social classes , kinds of jobs . They can be flags of social ordering . The difference between blue collar and white collar has almost always meant the difference between no tie and tie on the job . While some men in , say , the professorial classes go tieless , wearing blue work shirts under their tweed jackets , plenty of factory workers aspire to jobs that involve ties . In William Inge 's Picnic , Hal Carter speaks wistfully of a job " in a nice office where I can wear a tie and have a sweet little secretary . " When dressing up , blue collar workers often like a loud yell of garish color , while upper middle class men tend toward more discretion .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
