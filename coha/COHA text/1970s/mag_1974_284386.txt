From the beginning , last week 's Common Market summit was called the " summit of modest expectations . " Faced with the most severe complex of crises since the European Community was set up 17 years ago , the heads of the nine countries would succeed in Paris , according to one rather gloomy line of reasoning , if they did nothing more than agree to stay together . In the end , they did just that - and a little bit more-in what might be described as a summit of modest results . <P> The main question on the agenda was what the French like to call le problme Britannique . Since Harold Wilson 's Labor government was elected last February , the British have warned that they would not stay in the Market unless the terms of membership were revised to give them a better break on Community finances . ( Britain claims that by 1980 it will pay 24% of the Market 's budget , while it will have only 14% of the total EEC G.N.P. ) <P> Campaign Pledge . The uncertainty as to whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would stay or go has stymied all major Market decisions ever since , as well as causing considerable confusion in Britain 's own business affairs . Though Wilson and a majority of his Cabinet now seem convinced that Britain can not risk the cost of leaving the Common Market , they must stick by their campaign pledge to put the issue to a national referendum , and they desperately need at least concessions from the other eight to convince the British electorate . <P> After patient prodding by West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt , who within the past month seems to have emerged as West Europe 's leader , seven of the eight were willing to give Wilson the talisman he needs to wave in front of the voters . France , which had called the summit , was less willing , and for a few hours , President Valry Giscard d'Estaing ( see page 37 ) sounded more Gaullist than le grand Charles . " There can be nothing of this kind , " Giscard acidly said about Wilson 's demands at one heated bargaining session . " Conceding what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kingdom will remain in the Community . However , almost nothing will remain of that Community . " Replied Wilson : " If what you say , Mr. President , is to be the definitive view of the Community , then I see no hope whatever of successful negotiations . " <P> Ever the pragmatist , Giscard knew that he was isolated , and he accepted a Belgian-Italian compromise . While it gave Wilson essentially what he wanted , the compromise was described in opaque bureaucratese that cleverly disguised its real meaning . According to the protocol , the EEC will " create a correcting mechanism that could prevent during the period of convergence of the economies of the member states the possible development of situations unacceptable for a member state . " Translation : if a country 's economy goes sour , its budget contribution may be reduced . That ambiguous phraseology protected delicate French sensibilities but , at the same time , allowed the British press to claim a famous victory .                  @ @ @
