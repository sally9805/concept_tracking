txt MAYOR BILANDIC exhorted Democratic precinct captains Wednesday to get out and work for his re-election , likening criticism of his administration to the crucifixion of Jesus , the mass murders of Jews , and the recent collapses of foreign governments . His voice frequently cracking with emotion , Bilandic warned 500 payrollers attending the precinct captains luncheon in the Bismarck Hotel that his critics were out to destroy the Democratic party here . " We 've withstood challenges in the past , " he said . " They 've tried to take it away from us before , but they could n't . " BILANDIC THEN compared the criticism of him and the party organization with the persecution of Jesus and his disciples . " In the early history of Christianity , you see a leader , starting with 12 disciples . They crucify the leader and made martyrs of the others . " And what was the result ? " Christianity is bigger and stronger than it was before .

" IT 'S OUR TURN to be in the trenches to see if We are made of the same stuff as the early Christians , the persecuted Jews , the proud Poles , the blacks , and latinos . " Bilandic told the captains ' that his reelection was not so important to him personally as it was for the Democratic Party to keep control of city government . He then pledged his allegiance to the machine : " I 'm proud to be your friend . I 'll stand side by side with you , shoulder to shoulder and face any task , fight any foe , solve any problems . I 'll go from here to hell and back for you . That 's what we 're going to do . And we 're going to do it together .

" The people of Chicago are too smart to let it happen . They wo n't let it happen . I wo n't let it happen . " As he made that final vow , Bilandic 's voice cracked to a ' falsetto .

At those dinners , however , the captains remained seated until the mayor completed his speech . At Wednesday 's meeting , more than 30 persons seated in the back of the room left early . That may not have been Bilandic 's fault ; the public address system was poor , and the start of the film had been delayed several minutes because there was no audio . . ALTHOUGH BILANDIC did not mention the cause for the criticism of his administration , the city 's chaotic snag ' removal effort was clearly on the minds of the ward committeemen present . United States Rep. Dan Rostenkowski D. , Chicago , who is the 32d Ward committeeman , attempted to give the precinct workers some courage to face voters .
