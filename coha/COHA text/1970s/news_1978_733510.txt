txt WASHINGTON  --  What may he man 's oldest footprints in the sands of time  --  a series of tracks 3'z million years old found embossed on the bottom of an ancient African watering hole  --  were unveiled Friday by their discoverer , Mary Leakey . The British anthropologist said she is " 75 per cent sure " the prints are of a hominid , a man-like creature that is our ancestor , but that further laboratory examinations of the depressions will be needed to confirm her belief . The fossilized footprints were found in Tanzania two years ago in a series of layers of volcanic ash . The ash had been covered by a layer of lava so that the outlines were preserved from normal erosion . Minerals in the lava also served to date their deposits . THE . ANTHROPOLOGIST told a press conference at the National Geographic Society that 50 experts also have observed the prints and agree that they were made by a hominid . The creature would have been about 4 feet tall , judging by his gait , but little else has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Laetolil , about 30 miles from the Oftfuvei Gorge where Mrs. Leakey and her late husband , Louis Leakey . found In // Oldest ' human ' footprints are unveiled by scientist // 1959 what are regarded as the oldest ? human fossils , about 2 million years old . Also found in the ash ere prints of all manner of animal and bird life , including those of a monster elephant and a knuckle-walking primate about the size of a small chimpanzee . MRS . LEAKEY said she was being " a little bit careful " before making final judgments about the origins of the prints because there are so many fossilized animal footprints in the area . She said there is an outside chance that the prints might have been made by another knuckle-walking primate . Each of the prints is about 6 inches long and 41/2 inches wide . From the arrangement it is probable that the creature , unlike modern humans , moved very slowly and took extremely short steps , probably no longer than the length of his foot . Another oddity is the broadness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are extremely wide , she said . SHE SAID it was probable that the area , today the bed of a small stream that is dry ft : much of the year , was a watering hole at ft. - time prints were made . If confirmed , the discovery will push back by more than 3 million years the oldest human footprint . Human footprints made by Neanderthal man have been found in caves in Italy and been dated at 80,000 years old .
