York Review of Books does Vogelgesang provide any sustained analysis to support her argument . At this point , a less hardy thesismonger might have paused and reconnoitered . But there are ways to patch over the cracks . One can cite Theodore Roszak as a representative intellectual ; one can denature statements by others , asserting meanings that appear supported neither by the contexts nor even by the words quoted ; one can shift back and forth from discussing the counterculture or the New Left or the antiwar movement in general to the intellectuals in particular ; one can lean heavily on passages from a few very interesting but rather idiosyncratic writers like Norman Mailer and Susan Sontag . There is a principle behind these procedures . It is simply that in the heavens there exists a Platonic idea of the way political intellectuals carry on ( " fulminate , " Miss Vogelgesang might say ) . Whatever fits this idea counts as evidence ; whatever does not fit it can be set aside . Most revealing are the author 's evasions on the war itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's blind perseverance ? What was the proper role of the intellectuals in " speaking truth to power " ? Her critical tone implies a position from which the criticism is mounted , but that position is never revealed . This ultimate evasion allows her to play on every team at once . She joins with Chomsky in excoriating intellectuals like Schlesinger who were close to power ; she joins with Schlesinger in excoriating intellectuals like Chomsky who were systematically distrustful of power . She hints ( 1 ) that intellectuals failed to understand that LBJ continued the war under pressure from public opinion ; ( 2 ) that they failed to act effectively by shaping public opinion ; and ( 3 ) that public opinion was powerless to stop the war in any case . At regular intervals she tosses a bone to the intellectuals . They are " moralists " ; they are " naysayers . " Which is pretty much to say , " Do n't worry about their carrying on so ; the poor things ca n't help themselves . " When she sums up the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " a commend-able whimper , " I consider COM-mendable " only a hedging of bets , a 82 guilty afterthought . " Whimper " is the operative word in that phrase , and condescension is the operative attitude , here and throughout The Long Dark Night ol the Soul . The author 's stance is one of smug superiority toward people who on page after page of her own account turn out to have been precisely right . The problem , however , is not Miss Vogelgesang 's alone . Just as evidence about the behavior of political intellectuals is , more often than not , trimmed to fit the Platonic idea , or , rather , the Procrustean bed , which we have inherited from a long line of conservative thinkers since Edmund Burke , so the attitude toward intellectuals informing our discussions of them is commonly that of condescension . It is really more than any self-respecting ethnic group should put up with . A L THIS IS BY WAY of demonstrat- ing why a hook like The American Intellectual Elite , whatever its shortcomings , is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the state of intellectuals ; it establishes some standards for deuce . I must add , however , that image Kadushin 's book conveys the intellectual elite is someth less than enthralling . Many of transcribed comments from lengthy interviews are so wanting any special insight , originality , wit , that I suspect a full revelat of the Kadushin tapes might do the intellectual elite what the Wa gate tapes did for the Nixon WI House . If Kadushin is right , An ica 's intellectual elite has almost new ideas about the major prohlc facing the society ? and little will generate them . It prefers to re : not initiate ; to play the gatckeep examining , evaluating , advocating opposing new ideas that origin elsewhere . This pattern was alret true in the Sixties ; it is truer tod Indeed , many leading intellectu sense themselves less gatekeep than sentries . The war in Vietn and their exclusion from the ci rights movement has left them radicalized but shell-shocked .

The events of the Sixties not only alienated them from the dominant culture and its political leadership but from their natural constituency among the young as well . Instead of the gradual emergence of successors there is a " lost generation . " Of course , there may not he any successors ; the growing importance of the universities , the foundations , and the media , along with the tight financial restraints on intellectual journals , may so alter the structure of intellectual life that Kadushin 's study will look like a last anthropological foray into a disappearing culture . But if there are successors , they will be like the " melted " ethnics in the melting pot ? speaking a different language , unknowing and unappreciative of the experience of their forerunners . I can see little gain in that . ? THE MYSTERY OF MY BIRTH umorrunarery , nowcver , 1 1 ( 11C97M-Fl Anthony West , a novelist and biographer , is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given one side of a correspondence without the other that would make sense of it ; as custodian of Wells 's papers at the University of Illinois , he had learned that all my mother 's letters to my father were missing . The great glittering nugget that had been put into his hands would be no more than unpublishable dross unless he could somehow reconstruct the missing counterpart . " Then came a great piece of good fortune . During visits which I paid to London in the summers of 1971 , 1972 , and 1973 ... Dame Rebecca read the successive drafts of my story with the most scrupulous care . She corrected errors of fact , filled in the inevitable omissions of a narrative based on fragmentary materials , and set down with her accustomed force and wit how she herself regarded this part of her life . " Having admitted die enforced adoption of an approach that rules out any pretension to objectivity , Professor Ray goes on to compare the present work with his biography of Thackeray : " In dealing with Wells and Dame Rebecca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare opportunity of submitting my story to the scrutiny of one of its principals . The resulting narrative , whatever its other deficiencies , has an authority not to he attained by one based on documents alone . " I wish that defects could be so easily turned into virtues , but the " authority " Professor Ray lays claim to has produced little more than a partisan statement extending he running fight between my mother and father that should properly have been ended with his death . A PROFESSOR RAY has elected to tell it , the relationship between my parents was a progressive accumulation of wrongs done to a young and inexperienced girl by an older man who was losing touch with reality . One of the alleged wrongs involves the question of how I came to be born . The first time he mentions this topic Professor Ray clearly believes that a mistake was made : " None of Wells ' earlier love affairs had endured for more than a year or two . Anthony 's existence counted for more than any other factor in keeping Wells and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really viable . His birth was not , as has sometimes been suggested , a cal culated experiment in eugenics by two of the great intelligences of the age , but rather an inadvertence . " Yet , only thirty-two pages after committing himself to the mistake thesis , Professor Ray states its antithesis : " In an angry moment , when he feared that Rebecca might leave him , Wells intentionally omitted his usual precautions in the hope that pregnancy might bind her to him . " The idea that my father might have played this particularly dirty trick on anyone is wholly inconsistent with my knowledge of his character , requiring him to be a colder , nastier , and more unpleasantly calculating man than I ever knew him to be . This may mean no more than that I am still too fond of him to believe him capable of such a thing , but I think I have other , more substantial , grounds for arguing that he was most unlikely to have had recourse to such a tawdry trick , even in desperation , at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left out of his narrative of my parents ' relationship the rather significant figure of my half-sister , the child who was born just two years before I was , to a woman called Amber Reeves . To be sure , Professor Ray mentions Amber Reeves three times , but in such cursory and innocuous terms that no ordinary reader would know that my father 's affair with this lady had been the prelude to the ugliest episode in his career . There was nothing , I hasten to add , inherently ugly in the affair itself , but it became very ugly indeed when Beatrice and Sydney Webb decided to exploit their knowledge of it for their own ends . The Webbs were at this time engaged in a power struggle with my father over the leadership of the Fabian Society , and as he had a considerable following among its younger members the Webbs felt that he posed a real threat . When they found that he was vulnerable in his private life they had no hesitation in sending a letter to all the Fabians with teen-age daughters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . The Webbs subsequently justified their action to those who challenged its propriety by putting forward the sanctimonious plea that the Society could be endangered if its leadership was thought to support any father 's view on what was then called free love . The scandal thus provoked could not he kept within the Society , and no efforts were made to contain it . Before long my father found that he was being ostracized by a disagreeably large number of the people who made up his social and professional worlds , and he was presently forced to resign from his London club . These sanctions may seem piffling today , but they really meant something in their Edwardian English context . My father came from the servant class of a very class-conscious society , one in which the hierarchies of privilege were threatened by the forces of social change . As a jumped-up person from belowstairs who had achieved some prominence , he was made to pay a heavy price for having dared to lay his hands on the daughter of upstairs people . The viciously unpleasant way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken to in those years is hard to believe , and would be quite incredible if we did n't still have Malcolm Muggeridge around to keep the old line of venomous slander going . In any event , the tension and anxi-BOOKS ety generated in Wells by the constant harassment he was subjected to all through 1911 and 1912 had a disintegrating effect on the quality of both his fiction and his journalism , so that financial troubles were soon added to his other worries . It seems highly improbable , then , that with this miserable row still dragging on , as it was in the winter of 1913-14 , my father should have deliberately set out to repeat the social offense that had got him into so much hot water . The Amber Reeves affair is important not for the light it sheds on how I came to exist , interested though I am in that matter . It is important because the whole pattern of my father 's behavior in his relationship with my mother is made inexplicable by Professor Ray 's decision to leave out the antecedent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even paranoid in Professor Ray 's account take on another complexion altogether when they are seen to be those of a man who knows that the irresistible attraction of a very gifted woman is drawing him into a precise repetition of the greatest mistake of his life . ROFF.SSOR RAY MAKES another diUastrous omission when he describes my mother 's family background and says nothing about that of my father . A great deal of fresh information about my father 's parents , however , can be found in the MacKenzies'massive biography ; and what interests me about it is that the structures of the two families are shown to be essentially the same . In both there was an easygoing , charming , irresponsible , arid largely absentee father , and in both there was a dutiful , much put-upon , and visibly wronged mother who devoted herself to the task of raising her children in the face of the difficulties created by the father 's fecklessness . As an adult , by the time my mother arrived on the scene , my father had achieved an outstanding success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its physical setting . Easton Gleve , his pleasant eighteenth-century house set in a decaying park near Dunmow in Essex , was a small-scale reproduction of Uppark , the country house in Sussex in which his mother was working as housekeeper at the crucial period in which Wells formed his impression 84 of her relationship with his father . In this model of the original setting my father installed his wife . Jane , to enact the role of the much put-upon mother . Initially she was not asked to do more than tolerate my father 's absences from home ; then she was required to tolerate the absences knowing what they meant ; and finally she accepted full knowledge and even a degree of complicity . Jane Wells seems to have been a gentle , agreeable , and kindly woman who won the affection of a great many people , Arnold Bennett among them ; but whatever else she may have been , she was for half my father 's lifetime the perfect answer to his psychological necessities , as he evidently was to hers . She was also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my mother 's more pressing psychological necessities . To understand this , the reader must make a connection , as Professor Ray does not , between his account of my parents ' financial relationship and his account of the wrongs inflicted on my mother 's family by her father . The book suggests that my mother was always , while the relationship with Wells lasted , hard pressed for money and sometimes in serious difficulties , because my father was financially irresponsible , wildly extravagant in his personal expenditures , and compulsively mean when it came to providing for her immediate needs . My father 's accounts , which were scrupulously kept from a very early stage in his career , show conclusively that this was not so . But even if Professor Ray has not seen these accounts he should have noticed that the story of my mother 's hardship that he puts forward is difficult to reconcile with information that was in his possession . Toward the end of 1914 , for instance , my mother was having trouble with a housekeeper who was dishonest and a cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in the winter of 1915-16 she was again in difficulties because her two maids were quarreling with the nurse and her housekeeper-companion . It is fairly clear that this was not poverty as most people who have had experience of that state know it . Nor was it an ordinary sort of hardship that she had to endure while she was growing up . In spite of her husband 's fecklessness , my grandmother , Mrs. Fairfield , was always able to keep up a genteel middle-class establishment , to employ ser vants , to send her children to good private schools , and to put her eldest daughter through medical school . When she died she was living in a pleasant house in the Hampstead Garden Suburb , a locale impossible to associate with penury , and she was able to leave her youngest daughter a legacy of . ? 5.000 --  -- at a time when the pound was worth nearly $5 and had six to eight times its present purchasing power . This " virtual penury , " as Professor Ray chooses to call it , can only have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection that the absentee father had failed to meet . I any convinced that my father 's alleged meanness toward my mother was a phenomenon of the same kind ; the real problem was not that he gave her inadequate support , but that he was spending too large a part of his time and income on his wife and her children . By overlooking this dimension of my parents ' financial relationship , Professor Ray gives an account of my mother 's grievances as of late 1917 that must appear very odd indeed . The most terrible war in the history of Europe up to that time was in its third awful year ; hundreds of thousands of men had been killed and horribly maimed ; food was running short as the country began to feel the success of Germany 's U-boat campaign and the way immediately ahead seemed dark . At this juncture , my mother is portrayed by Professor Ray as " brooding over what she had to endure and what she had given up . Instead of the full and exciting life in the center of English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending her youth virtually in hiding , always in a false position , always having to act a part . " And that was only half the story . " The picture offered by Wells ' other life at Easton Gleve could not but present itself to her mind 's eye ks a socialist writer she disapproved of conspicuous consumption . Yet the contrast between Wells ' large and comfortable house at Easton with its staff of loyal and well-trained servants , its lively and open family life , and its flow of interesting guests ... and the domestic discomfort and humiliation made inevitable by her own irregular situation was not lost upon her . " But that was not all . Jane Wells , who had initially licensed my father 's ask too much . There is no difference between myself and Odette , and Willie Maugham living with Gerald Baxton at Cap Ferrat . We both demand the surrender of the loved one . " It obviously bothers the MacKenzies no end that the man they have so many rational grounds for admiring can not have anything but infantile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Common sense insists that if you know a thing like that , you must be able to do something about it , but here was my father knowing it , and not doing anything about it ? he never achieved an adult relationship , one between equals , in the whole course of his life . This realization seems to have torpedoed the MacKenzies ' confidence in their project when they were about two-thirds of the way through it . The book is pretty good , though flatly written , up to that point . From then on , it is a mechanical performance , a matter of piling up the facts in the hope that the central problem will go away . It does n't . But the facts in this case are facts , which is something to be thankful for . A LIFE ON FILM by Rhoda Koenig My Life and My Films , by Jean Renoir . Translated by Norman Denny . Atheneum , $10 .

" That people do not learn from experience , that age embitters more often than it mellows , is a truism well known to Jean Renoir , who places " the good old man " on his list of detested cliches , along with " southerners dressed in gay colors " and " love which conquers all . " And yet Renoir , arguably the greatest director of sound films , is himself the embodiment of " the good old man . " His movies had always made us suspect this ; his autobiography confirms it . The good old man Renoir portrays here is , however , not a simple old man ; it is inconceivable that he could be anyone 's pet . He tells how , as a child , he came across a couple making love in the gardener 's shed , became frightened , and ran away . Then his comment , a deadpan parody of the pompous , **33;3065;TOOLONG type of writing : " It was my first glimpse of the hollowness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more interesting fellow than the notary , and the pastrycook or farmer as deserving as the Impressionist painter of the title " artist . " Yet he wastes no sentimentality on the happy , anti-intellectual peasant . He quotes his beloved father as saying , " The whole lot of it spiritualism is n't worth a well-shaped bottom , " but then points out : " It may be added that this reaction did not represent my father at his most profound . " Renoir has had ample reason to feel embittered about the tyranny of the peasant over the artist . He has been the most beleaguered of filmmakers , failing time and again to wheedle money from the studios or to please the public . Three years were spent looking for the money to make La Grande Illusion . The River was financed by a Beverly Hills florist named Mehldowney with a passionate desire to film an elephant hunt . La Regie du feu , which regularly turns up on ten-best lists , was hissed in 1939 by audiences who found it nasty and subversive . Renoir despairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve-year-old mind , but he comes to much the same conclusion : if you want to make money , he warns , never surprise the public . Do n't confront them with any kind of problem , do n't challenge the childhood myths that constrict their thinking . And , above all , do n't show them any unpleasant truths . " So many humiliating concessions and wasted smiles , " he recalls . " So many denials and , above all , so much lost time ! " ( For all that , Renoir never suffered the brutal , complete rejection that was the fate of such directors as D. W. Griffith and Erich von Stroheim . Renoir describes a banquet held in Griffith 's honor by the men he had made rich and who would not permit him to make any more films . " At the end of the meal he was invited in the traditional manner to make a short speech . He stood up and , contemplating the assembled ty coons , he spoke as follows : ' Can anyone here lend me five dollars ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into light music . " ) " I have spent my life experimenting with different styles , " Renoir writes , " but it all comes down to this : my different attempts to arrive at the inward truth , which for me is the only one that matters . " This search has led Renoir to try artificiality , romanticism , realism , none of which he finds any more ' ' real " or " truthful " than the others . He recalls with great affection the melodramas of the Boulevard du Crime and laments their replacement by " the so-called realistic theatre . " Realism , for Renoir , is merely " the realism of appearances . " The ideal member of his audience might be Saint-Exupery 's little prince , for whom the most satisfactory picture of a sheep was a drawing of a box with a few holes in it ( the sheep was inside ) . His objective and his triumph have been to use a visual medium to make us see the invisible .
