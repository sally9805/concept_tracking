" Organization is policy , " says Roy Ash , former president of Litton Industries and new director of the Office of Management and Budget . Apparently Richard Nixon agrees . He has taken the advice of Ash and a council he headed that the Government should be reorganized to make it more responsive to presidential command . Though Congress failed to act on Nixon 's larger plans-to merge six Cabinet departments into four-the President has gone right ahead and created a super-Cabinet by Executive order . The effort is receiving mixed reviews-as a laudable effort to streamline Government , or as a worrisome presidential grab for ever-stronger authority . <P> Most Presidents have complained about their Cabinets , but Nixon is the first to alter the structure significantly . He has promoted three Cabinet members to the rank of Presidential Counsellor , with broadened responsibility for handling interdepartmental programs . Health , Education and Welfare Secretary-designate Caspar Weinberger will become Counsellor for Human Resources , Housing and Urban Development Secretary-designate James Lynn will be Counsellor for Community Development , and Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz will oversee Natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departments . The shift is sensible , but it has been accomplished at the expense of the other Cabinet officers , who have clearly suffered a demotion . From now on , for example , if Interior Secretary Rogers Morton wants to get a decision on the use of park land , he will have to go , hat in hand , to Earl Butz , whereas formerly he could go directly to the White House . In turn , Butz will pass along his decision to John Ehrlichman , Domestic Affairs chief in the White House . " I will be considerably less involved in the actual policy promulgation , " Ehrlichman explains , " and my role will be increasingly ministerial , as literally a conduit for passing along messages and documents and things of that kind . " <P> The point of the change is to bridge the gap between the White House and the bureaucracy . The Counsellors will have a foot in each establishment - doubtless a stretching experience . Supposedly , the new setup will permit the President to cut back his Executive Office staff from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took office . He will then have to deal with fewer people , as he prefers . When he gives an order , it will glide more swiftly down the chain of command . <P> The task of making the reorganization work falls , appropriately , on Roy Ash , who will manage not only the federal budget but the entire Executive Branch . In this post , he ranks with the other big four of the super-Cabinet : H.R. Haldeman , White House chief of staff ; Ehrlichman ; Henry Kissinger ; and George Shultz , Adviser for Economic Affairs . Whether Ash is the man to fill this awesome job has become a matter of debate . At issue in the first place is his management of Litton , whose profits fell from a lackluster $50 million in fiscal 1971 to only $1.1 million last year .
