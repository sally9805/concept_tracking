Well-dressed and attractive , the woman looked just right behind the wheel of her expensive , well-kept Mercedes-Benz . But when she pulled into the Baltex Garage in Boston the other day , she was as angry as she was chic . " Do you know how much the Mercedes people want to tune this car ? " she asked rhetorically . " They want $100 for an ordinary tune-up . Ridiculous ! I 'll do it myself . " She reserved a stall , returned the next day in blue jeans and sweatshirt , and made good her promise-at a cost of only $20 . Says Baltex Partner John Price : " She did a pretty good job . " <P> Price and his newest customer have plenty of company . With more than 96 million cars on American roads , with queues and prices growing at conventional service stations , with competent and honest mechanics scarcer than ever , the fix-it-yourself garage is a popular new feature in several cities . Saving money is the prime attraction . Stalls rent for $2 to $3.50 an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free or at nominal charge , and parts are sold at a discount . <P> Like a Clock . Convenience is an important factor . The garages are open evenings and weekends , when most regular service centers do no major repair work . Know-how , of course , is a problem . While a few centers have staff mechanics on hand to help when serious difficulties crop up , insurance laws in some states prohibit such assistance . Some garages offer expert advice and collections of fix-it literature . They also attract car buffs who are willing to share their knowledge with beginners . Baltex is even organizing a five-session course for customers-tuition : $25 . At the Van Nuys , Calif. , Auto Hobby Center , Actor Bob Purvey recently rebuilt the engine of his 1959 Jaguar . That intricate operation would have cost $2,600 if done commercially ; Purvey spent only $1,000 . " I hope I never have to do it again , " he says , " but now I know just how it works . No garage is ever going to put anything over on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock . " <P> Other converts to self-service , including many women , have become addicted to tinkering , viewing it as a challenging hobby as well as a way of beating inflation . Sol Dolgin , a Jaguar enthusiast who opened the Van Nuys garage 14 months ago , says : " We thought that a large part of our business would be motor tune-ups and brakes . Instead , people are putting in transmissions , brakes and rear ends . They are n't afraid to try anything . We 've had 8,000 customers in the past year , and they get a great feeling of accomplishment . " <P> Joe Russo , a Los Angeles architect who drives a 1964 MGB , agrees . " I 've learned all I know about cars here at the center , " he says . " I got a manual , read it , and started doing a little bit at a time . " As his confidence grew , he went into more complex tasks , such as rebuilding his engine . Says Russo : " The mystery of mechanics is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his wife 's old Buick , Law Student Ernest Burger remarks : " I 'm actually acting out a childhood fantasy . " Many people have always itched to play mechanic , but lacked encouragement until the new garages came along .
