THE ADMINISTRATION/COVER STORY <P> THE denials , the evasions , the secretiveness and , yes , the lies-all had failed . The Watergate case was breaking wide open . A ten-month campaign by some of the highest past and present officials of the Nixon Administration to cover up their involvement was crumbling . Stripped of its protective shrouds , the scandal was rapidly emerging as probably the most pervasive instance of top-level misconduct in the nation 's history . <P> Incredibly , a former Attorney General was cited repeatedly by White House and Justice Department sources as almost certain to be indicted by a federal grand jury . So , too , was Nixon 's chief legal counsel , as well as the second-ranking official in his successful re-election campaign and several former White House aides . A second former Cabinet member and campaign fund raiser seemed only a shade less likely to be indicted . There was a very real possibility that some of these and other officials might be convicted of crimes and sent to jail .

The suspect officials hired attorneys to defend them , held furtive conferences with federal prosecutors and shuttled in and out of a Washington grand jury room , dodging newsmen . In the White House , handsome young presidential aides , selected for their team loyalty and their vaunted proficiency in public relations , turned bitterly on each other , contacting newsmen in order to leak their suspicions about their colleagues . No one could be certain that his office neighbor might not be in the headlines next morning . <P> At the epicenter stood a somber and shaken Richard Nixon , facing one of his gravest crises . Forced by events to concede that his earlier blanket denials of White House involvement had been wrong , he finally dropped the pretense of being untouched by it all . Either he had been inexcusably remiss in not pressing an earlier , deeper investigation of the matter , or he had been amazingly naive in trusting his aides ' protestations of innocence-despite repeated evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing party to their deception . Either way , he could not escape heavy responsibility . Despite his plans for returning " power to the people , " a major thrust of his Administration has been to centralize the vast responsibilities of the Executive Branch to an unprecedented degree into the hands of a relatively small circle of these overly trusted White House aides . <P> The spreading scandal created for the nation a crisis of confidence in its Government . An overwhelming majority of Americans re-elected Nixon in large part because he spoke so often of the need to regain respect for law , sternly administered and applied with equal severity to all . He assailed soft judges and Supreme Court decisions that enable criminals to go free on technicalities . Now his closest official associates are suspected of not only violating federal laws but also trying to subvert the judicial system to conceal their wrongdoing . One high Administration official was moved to an exaggerated lament : " I do n't know why any citizen should ever again believe anything a Government official says .
