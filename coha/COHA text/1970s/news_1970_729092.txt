txt Here is the text of a statement by President Nixon early today in connection with legislation to halt a nationwide rail strike : To stop a crippling national railroad strike , which would work severe hardship on millions of Americans and impede an orderly economic expansion , I am signing this bill . I expect , and the nation will expect , that those who may have left their jobs prior to tonight 's congressional enactment will immediately return to work and their leaders return to the bargaining table . Goes Beyond Request Monday evening I proposed legislation intended to continue operation of the r ailr o a d s while the free collective bargaining process went on . But Congress went beyond my request , and imposed a settlement . It selected one portion of the emergency board 's recommendations , raising wages , without adopting a balancing portion that would increase productivity and cut back the inflationary effect of the pay increase . Productivity improvements such as those contained in the board ' s report are absolutely essential to combat the rise in prices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress of the need to persuade business and labor to curb inflation , when the chips were down , a majority of the Congress voted to increase wages sharply without increasing productivity ? in plain words , to speed up the rise in costs and prices . This kind of action , under the pressure of a strike deadline which was not met , would not have been necessary if Congress had passed the reform of the Railway Labor Act that I proposed 10 months ago . Congress has not held a single day of hearings on the proposed Emergency Public Interest Protection Act . With the results of this neglect again apparent , I again urge the Congress to make the reforms so badly needed .
