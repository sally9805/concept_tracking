Baseball is holding its second reentry draft this week , and we want a graduation picture of the first class of free agents . Taller players , stand in the back ; you shorter guys , stand in the front . No , Reggie , you ca n't stand on your wallet . Always causing trouble . Hey , somebody wheel Rudi and Grich into place . Poor guys . Tenace , you showed a lot of guts coming here after the season you had . We appreciate it . C'm on , Fuentes , take the hot dog out of your mouth . Incidentally , fellows , Dick Allen has n't come out of the shower yet , so he wo n't be joining us . Look this way now , and everybody say , ' Greenbacks . ' " Click . // And what a handsome photograph they would make , those 24 men who signed with 15 teams for $24.57 million in long-term contracts and bonuses . When representatives of the 26 major league clubs gather at the Plaza Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mental picture of this group and consider well the lessons it represents . Only then will they venture into the reentry market again , where about 85 more free agents are anxiously waiting to be drafted , courted and signed . // If the owners chase after them with less enthusiasm than they showed last year , it will be understandable . While , as a group , the first free agents played quite well , most of them did not bring the instant success and box-office riches that some club executives naively expected . National League champion Los Angeles and American League West winner Kansas City did well without any free agents . NL East leader Philadelphia had a free agent in First Baseman Richie Hebner , but he was not essential to the club 's success . On the other hand , the New York Yankees won the American League pennant and the World Series with major contributions from Reggie Jackson and Don Gullett . Among the free agents , Jackson was the most obstreperous personality and the most productive hitter ( .286 , 32 home runs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitcher ( 14-4 ) . // There were some other fine performers . The Fireman of the Year in both of the leagues  --  Bill Campbell of Boston and Rollie Fingers of San Diego  --  came out of the reentry draft . So did the two Comeback Players of the Year , Chicago 's Eric Soderholm , who did not play at all in 1976 , and San Francisco 's Willie McCovey , who did not play at all well . Meanwhile , hot-dogger Tito Fuentes batted .309 for Detroit , newcomer Paul Dade hit .291 for Cleveland , and Doyle Alexander was 17-11 for Texas . Others , like Montreal 's Dave Cash , Milwaukee 's Sal Bando , Texas ' Campy Campaneris and Atlanta 's Gary Matthews , played pretty much to form . In fact , only a few of the free agents fell far short of expectations , notably Gene Tenace of San Diego , who had a .233 batting average and was a disappointment behind the plate ; Pitcher Wayne Garland of Cleveland , who was 13-19 ; and Designated Hitter Don Baylor of California , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far out of the race that it did n't matter anymore . California also lost Joe Rudi and Bobby Grich in June to season-ending injuries . Oakland 's Dick Allen departed in June , too . He was permanently suspended by owner Charlie Finley after Finley discovered Allen taking a mid-game shower . // Critics of the reentry draft invariably cite fifth-place California as proof that the system does not work . " The draft is not the answer , " says Minnesota owner Calvin Griffith , whose team mounted a serious challenge without making use of it . " Look at Angel owner Gene Autry . He got taken . " Baltimore General Manager Hank Peters says , " I do n't like to name clubs , but California signed good players it did n't particularly need . " Angel GM Harry Dalton counters , " If you exercise good judgment , the draft can help , and I think we exercised good judgment . Before they got hurt , Grich and Rudi were doing a fine job , and Baylor finished close to his best performance in several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York and the improvement of Boston and Texas , which finished second in the two American League divisions , the free agents did not provide the overall competitive lift that teams were seeking . Clubs like the White Sox and the Orioles made unexpected pennant bids with economy-model free agents whom nobody else particularly wanted . And free-agent-laden teams like Cleveland , Texas , California and San Diego got off to such bad starts that their managers were fired . According to Milwaukee President Bud Selig , " It is clear that you ca n't build a team through the free-agent draft . You can add to a team , you can fill in , but if your club is lousy to begin with , it 's not going to make it great . " // No team understands the lessons of the system better than Cleveland , whose experiences with Garland and Dade provide the year 's most interesting case study . Last fall , following their first winning season in eight years , the Indians decided they were only a player or two away from being a contender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though Cleveland had not won the pennant since 1954 and was saddled with a $5.5 million debt , President Ted Bonda jumped into the free-agent pool . The Indians signed Garland , a 27-year-old righthander who had just won 20 games for Baltimore , and then added Dade , a 25-year-old infielder-outfielder who had been the Pacific Coast League 's batting champion with a .363 average . Cleveland gave Garland an unprecedented ( some said foolish ) 10-year , $2.3 million contract and Dade a two-year deal for $93,000 . Early in the ' 76 season the Orioles had rebuffed Garland 's request for a $30,000 salary  --  he was then making $23,000  --  while all Dade had wanted from the California organization was the $19,000 big league minimum . They held out , and it paid off . // Bonda admits that Cleveland was " shooting craps , " but he insists , " We had to make it this year to be economically viable . The fans were getting disgruntled and discouraged , and we wanted to tell them we were doing everything we possibly could to make us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment aimed at a short-term gain . I thought we already had the nucleus of a good team and that Garland and Dade would be the frosting we needed . We figured that if we stayed in the race we would draw 1.4 to 1.5 million spectators , and we would make money . " // It did not work out that way . The Indians got off to a slow start , fired Manager Frank Robinson and did not improve under his replacement , Jeff Torborg . They finished fifth , 28 ? games behind the Yankees , and their attendance fell from 948,776 to 900,365 , the lowest in Cleveland since 1973 and among the worst in baseball . The dice had come up snake eyes . // Much of the blame for the team 's failure has been directed at Garland . He had been the Indians ' first selection in the reentry draft , and the contract they gave him was second in total value only to the $2.9 million for which George Steinbrenner signed Jackson . Cleveland General Manager Phil Seghi considered Garland a " career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indians the nucleus of a strong staff for perhaps a decade to come . // Cleveland had not been Garland 's first choice , or his second , or even his third . He had hoped to get a five-year , $1 million contract to play in Boston , California , Texas or New York , but none of those franchises showed much interest in him . When his agent , Jerry Kapstein , told him that Cleveland was offering more than twice what he had hoped for , Garland was flabbergasted . In fact , it was so much money that for tax purposes he declined to take a $300,000 signing bonus and told the Indians to dole out the amount piecemeal in his salary checks . Instead , he took only enough cash up front to make a down payment on a 12-room , $150,000 home in a Cleveland suburb . He was now making $230,000 a season ( 10 times his Baltimore salary ) , and he would continue to make it unless he did something crazy , like injure himself skiing , skydiving or performing some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembers that soon after he signed , " I called my mother and told her , ' Mom , I did n't get my million . ' And she said , ' Well , son , money is n't everything . ' Then I said , ' No , I got two million ! ' " // After just three major league seasons  --  only one of them with a winning record  --  Garland had struck it rich . Now all he needed to do was deliver his sinker and slider in the same smooth , compact motion and with the same stunning success he had achieved with the Orioles in ' 76. // Garland could not do it . In spring training he developed a sore arm and spent 2 ? weeks throwing at a picture of a truck tire on the outfield wall of Tucson 's Hi Corbett Field to get back into shape . When the season began , he says , " I wanted to impress people too quickly , and I tried to rush my development . " Instead , all he did was pitch terribly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man from Warren , Ohio who wrote the pitcher a letter in mid-June that said , " Your performance for our team is a disgrace , to say the least . I am sure your teammates must feel an equal degree of disgust with your pitching to date . They , however , are not free to say what others say . Only you know how you rest with your conscience after pulling this dirty trick on Cleveland . " // And there were the taunts from the stands . Garland heard one kid say . " I do n't want that guy 's autograph . He ai n't worth a damn . " One man called him a bum for an entire game , and Garland says he would have gone into the stands after him had Torborg not talked him out of it . // Garland realizes that he was not the pitcher he should have been . " There were one or two times that I thought maybe I was lousy , " he says , " that maybe last year had been a fluke . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his contract . " Everywhere I went , everyone I saw talked about the money . People must think they dropped it all on a table and said , ' Have fun , do n't spend it all in one place . ' What they do n't realize is , with the way things are going in baseball , I could be underpaid in 10 years . And if this club folds , I wonder if I 'll be left out in the cold . " // For a while , Garland seemed to be overpaid . Four times teams rallied to beat him in the last three innings . And he beat himself , too , losing one game on a wild pitch in the ninth and another on a wild pitch and a home run in the last inning . But as the season progressed he began to pitch better . Although he won only six of his last 15 decisions , his ERA in his last 16 starts was 2.63 . He finished the year among the league 's top five pitchers in starts , innings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckoning , he had done his job . // " All I wanted to do was be recognized as a consistent pitcher , " Garland says , " and I feel I was that . There is no doubt in my mind that my record should have been a lot better than it was . In the second half of the season I pitched as well as , or perhaps better than , I did last year . Maybe now people can say I 'm not such a bad pitcher after all . " Did the money make the abuse more tolerable ? " Even though I feel I did the right thing for me and my family , I 'd like to forget this year , " says Garland . " But I know I never will . " // Paul Dade will remember 1977 , too , but for very different reasons . In seven previous professional seasons he had consistently pounded minor league pitching for high averages , but in 24 major league games he had batted an unprepossessing .179 . Although he was California 's first-round draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing him up to the majors in ' 77 . And when his name was put before the other 23 teams in last year 's reentry draft , the Indians were the lone club to select him and make a serious bid for his services . Oakland also drafted Dade , but the A 's were not really interested in signing him . Under the reentry rules , which are designed to ensure competitive bidding for all free agents , Oakland 's lack of fervor once again made Dade available to all teams . The White Sox offered a one-year contract and bonus of $40,000 , but they gave no guarantee that he would make the club . Only the Indians agreed not to send him back to the minors without his consent . // Teams were unwilling to commit themselves to Dade because he was thought to be a disciplinary problem . He came by the reputation early , drawing two fines in his very first week as a professional with Idaho Falls  --  one for missing the bus on a road trip , the other ( shades of Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . There were also his bad credit rating and his penchant for speaking loudly in his own behalf , even if no one particularly cared to listen . He might have been considered a smaller risk if he had had some major league success and , as one Indian official suggests privately , if he had not been black . // Dade himself wonders why it took so long for him to get his chance . He figured he was ready for the big leagues as soon as he completed high school in Seattle . Before the Angels drafted him , they tested their prospect by making him bat against a 6 ' 5 " pitcher from their Triple A team . According to Dade , " I took him out of the yard to all fields . " So when he failed to reach the majors , he decided , " Somebody in California must have said something against me . But it was n't right . I busted my butt in this game . I always knew I could do the job , and the setbacks just put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being brought up , and I 'd say , ' What 's going on here ? ' When the Angels sent me down in 1976 , I cried . And when that season ended I cried again  --  from happiness  --  because I knew that now somebody had to give me my chance . " // The man who did was Seghi . " Dade can throw , run and hit , " the general manager says . " When he became available , I was interested . I felt strongly that he had not been given the opportunity he deserved . I can relate to a player sitting on the bench , making big noises . He can get a reputation . " // When Dade signed , he celebrated at his home in Renton , Wash . by drinking a lot of Michelob and promising his wife that this time he was definitely going to make it . Now he admits that " maybe the beer made me boast , " but he kept his word . He emphatically fulfilled the pledge he made to himself that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a month of coming off the Cleveland bench , he was promoted to regular status on May 11 . At the end of June he was batting .350 , second in the league to Rod Carew . He ended the season with a .291 average , third highest on the team , and he proved himself remarkably versatile , starting at all three outfield positions , at third base and as the designated hitter . He batted everywhere in the order except ninth . A severely bruised thigh muscle prematurely ended his season on Sept. 25 , but when he returns next year , Torborg hopes to play him in right field and bat him second . // In keeping with his personality , Dade managed to draw attention to himself in other respects than his fine play . He chose his uniform number , 00 , he says , to represent his anonymity when compared to most of the free agents . He was also frequently found guilty by the Indians ' Kangaroo Kourt for hot-dogging and fraternizing with the opposition . " I guess Paul is what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It just took a while for everybody to understand him . " // In fact , Dade is quite easy to understand once his insecurity is recognized . It is as obvious as the number on his back . Even now he says , " I 'm scared . They might not want me after next year . " Dade will probably worry about that all winter , at least when he is not sitting in his new reclining chair in his new house , watching football games on his new 25-inch color television set . Now that Dade has made the big leagues and paid his bills , he figures he can start to enjoy life a little . " I 've finally come through the door , " he says . // Bonda claims he does not regret signing either of the two free agents . " Absolutely , I 'd do it again , " he says . " Dade had a fine season , and Garland was the backbone of the staff , even if he did n't have the won-lost record to show for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we become a contender any time in the next five years , it will still be worthwhile . " // Despite Bonda 's optimism , Cleveland 's experience with Garland and Dade will not be lost on the other 25 clubs in this week 's draft . Some will be hesitant because they fear they could be squandering their investment on a 19-game loser . Others will be bold because .291 hitters are hard to come by at any price these days . And a large number will not sign anybody because they think there are better uses for their money . Prominent in this group are the two expansion teams , Seattle and Toronto . Lou Gorman , the Mariners ' director of baseball operations , says , " Rather than sign one guy for a million and a half dollars , we would prefer to sink the money into a farm and scouting system and perhaps develop two or three star-class players of our own for the same amount of money . " // Surprisingly , one of the teams that will be active is Kansas City , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft and repeated as division champions . Owner Ewing Kauffman says it will be different this season because , " Last year we took care of our own . George Brett and Hal McRae , for example , both signed multi-year contracts valued at more than $1 million . Now I believe our guys realize that the players becoming free agents have taken a risk . So I do n't think they will be concerned if we have to pay a free agent slightly more than they are receiving . We want to keep improving our club . We 'll be bidding . " // Kauffman will be glad to hear that the bidding will probably not be as high this year . At least , it will not be if the owners stick to their intention of being more astute about whom they go after and how much they offer . " Much of last year 's bidding was created by the impression that if you did n't bid , you were a cheap bum , " says White Sox President Bill Veeck . " Now fans have seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't going to exert the same kind of public-opinion pressure . " // Another reason for moderation is expressed by San Diego GM Bob Fontaine . " Last year a lot of glamorous players were available , " he says . " Now there are a few quality players , but they do n't have the known appeal of a Reggie Jackson , Joe Rudi or Rollie Fingers . " // Nevertheless , it still takes only two teams to make a bidding war . And as a result , a few players are going to get most of the money , while others will be virtually ignored . // Most of the heavy action will involve the outfielders and pitchers . Among the few catchers available are journeymen like George Mitterwald , who played for the Cubs this season , and the best-known infielder is light-hitting Cleveland Shortstop Frank Duffy . The outfield offers some particularly attractive possibilities : Larry Hisle and Lyman Bostock of Minnesota ; Richie Zisk , Oscar Gamble and Ralph Garr of the White Sox ; and Dave Kingman of wherever he happens to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who hit .301 for the Indians , and Rick Miller and Elliott Maddox , whose talents were hidden on the Boston and Baltimore benches . // There is no Gullett or Fingers among the pitchers , but there are the Yankees ' Mike Torrez and Pittsburgh Reliever Rich Gossage . Those two , along with Hisle , Bostock and Zisk , should be the biggest gainers of all , but no owner , not even Atlanta 's Ted Turner , is saying out loud what player interests him most . When Turner tampered with Matthews before last year 's draft , Commissioner Bowie Kuhn fined him $10,000 . Now acts of loud-mouthed indiscretion could cost $250,000 . Better to keep quiet and save it for your No. 1 draft choice .
