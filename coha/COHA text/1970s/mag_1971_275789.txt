One of the shrillest cries of the disaffected young has revolved around a lack of legal avenues to change the System . No more . Last Wednesday in an extraordinary evening session , the Ohio house of representatives , by a vote of 81 to 9 , made Ohio the 38th state to approve the 26th Amendment to the Constitution . That was sufficient for ratification , which means that 18-to 20-year-olds will be able to vote in all elections , local and state as well as federal . <P> The states moved with astonishing alacrity , taking only three months and seven days from the time the amendment was first sent out for ratification . Said President Nixon : " Some 11 million young men and women who have participated in the life of our nation through their work , their studies and their sacrifices for its defense are now fully included in the electoral process of our country . I urge them to honor this right by exercising it . " <P> Just how widely-and wisely-they will exercise their vote is a subject under close scrutiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Democrats should benefit by a 3-to-l margin from the youth vote . Admits one G.O.P. leader : " Privately , most Republicans would just as soon not have seen this happen . " But no one is going to benefit much until the critical question of whether students may register and vote from their campus addresses is resolved in state and federal courts .
