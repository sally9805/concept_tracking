It was the windup of the most costly , complicated and exhausting round of presidential primaries the U.S. had ever put on . Between 6 a.m. last Feb. 24 in New Hampshire and 8 p.m. last Tuesday in California , some 25 million Americans had voted in 31 primaries-the most ever . By direct vote they chose about 75%-also the most ever-of all the Democratic and Republican delegates who will sit in the nominating conventions this summer . The marathon had cost the candidates and the taxpayers at least $65 million . The process had left many a numb politician and citizen wondering if there is not a better way to choose the people who will run for President . <P> There is , in fact , a lot to be said for the U.S. primary system , especially if a little more system could be put into it . In 1976 it has clearly designated the Democratic nominee , Jimmy Carter . It swiftly screened out the least serious Democratic candidates ( Shriver , Shapp , Harris , Bentsen ) . It told two aging warriors ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It gave some national exposure to three interesting Westerners ( Brown , Udall , Church ) . It ended the influence of George Wallace as a national political figure . A very respectable hundred days ' work . <P> On the Republican side , the primaries could not produce a clear-cut winner , and this was a significant result in itself . The primary process made it possible for an ex-Governor who had never held national office to mount a formidable campaign against a sitting President . Whatever the merits and flaws of Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan , it is bracing in a democracy to see the powers of incumbency so effectively challenged . Only yesterday Richard Nixon , John Dean , etc. , were dreaming up schemes to " maximize the incumbency . " <P> The 31 state primaries put a premium on at least five qualities that are pertinent to the presidency : <P> &gt; Physical stamina . <P> &gt; Organizing ability . The deployment of money , staff and the candidate 's own precious time through a 31-primary season is a real test of planning skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The capacity to recover from a gaffe , react calmly to a reverse , adjust to the unexpected . <P> &gt; The ability to explain , project , sell : by TV , in print , in person ; to factory workers , suburbanites , blacks , students , farmers , Southerners , Yankees . Also known as the quality of leadership . <P> &gt; A sense of humor . <P> In the last category the hands-down winner among the Democrats was Mo Udall . In all the other categories Jimmy Carter swept the field . <P> Nobody would claim that the primary process illuminates all the major presidential attributes in character and intellect . It does not tell much about the all-important ability to select and attract talent ; primary campaigns can go a long way ( Carter , Reagan ) with surprisingly small staffs of home-state intimates.
