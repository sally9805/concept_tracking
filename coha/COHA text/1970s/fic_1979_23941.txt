RENDEZVOUS WITH MARGRET OR : HAPPY ENDING by Heinrich Boll HE JOURNEY THERE was pleasant : the Rhine still under early-morning mist ; weeping willows , barges , sirens , the trip taking precisely as long as I needed for my breakfast . Coffee and rolls acceptable , eggs fried ; no baggage , just cigarettes , newspaper , matches , return ticket , ballpoint pen , wallet , and handkerchief , and the certainty of seeing Margret again . After so many years , after several abortive meetings , after knowing her for more than forty years , I had been surprised and stirred by something I had never seen before : her handwriting , strong yet graceful , and the words , written on the death announcement with surprising firmness : " do come  --  it would give me so much pleasure to see you again . " The small d in do made me suspect that she had never come to terms with the capital D ; we all have a letter or two that we stumble over . On arrival I got rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left it behind in the dining car and reached the cemetery in good time after my own fashion : too late for the Largo , the Dc Profundis , and the incense in the chapel , too late also to join the cortege . I was just in time to see the acolytes taking off their vestments and bundling them under their arms as they walked away . The taller one unscrewed the processional cross into three sections , packing it away in a case obviously designed for that purpose , and as they got into the waiting taxi they all lighted cigarettes : priest , driver , and acolytes . The driver offered the priest a light , the younger acolyte did the same for the older one , and at that point one of them must have made a joke : I saw them all laugh , saw the older acolyte coughing with laughter and cigarette smoke , and I had to laugh , too , when I thought of the sacristy cupboards where in another five minutes they would be putting away their paraphernalia : oak , baroque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Saint Francis Xavier , which in 1925 had been renamed Saint Peter Canisius ; and it was n't I , it was the deceased who had just been buried , on whose coffin clods of earth were still falling , he who had saved the day in 1945 by his inspired recollection of the depth of those cupboards where , behind the neat piles of altar linen and various sacred utensils , we had hidden cigarettes and coffee stolen from the Americans when they left their Jeeps unattended or invited us in groups to a kind of werewolf-reeducation . It was he , not I , who , with the corrupt cunning of the European , had correctly sized up the Americans ' naive awe of ecclesiastical institutions , and for years I had wondered why instead of claiming credit for this inspiration he had always ascribed it to me . Much later , long after I had left home , it dawned on me that a story of that kind would have done no service to his respectability , whereas it " fitted " me , although I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ APPROACHED the Zerhoff family grave with circumspection , avoiding the paths on which I would have encountered men with and without top hats , ladies with and without Persian lamb coats , former schoolmates and knights of Catholic orders , schoolmates as knights of Catholic orders . I walked along the familiar path between the rows of graves to our own family grave , where the last burial ? my father 's  --  had taken place five years ago ; it had been insinuated that he had died brokenhearted because neither of his two sons had begotten a male heir in any woman 's womb ; well , he had no female heir either . The burial plot was well cared for , the lease paid ; the gravel was truly snow-white , the beds of pansies heart-shaped , the pansies in turn  --  nine or eleven to a bed  --  planted in the shape of a heart . The names of Mother , Father , and Josef on the lectern-shaped marble gravestones ; above Josef 's name , the inevitable Iron Cross ; the gravestones of long-dead ancestors overgrown with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple , classicistic , vaguely Puritan cross , to which had later been added a scroll proclaiming in neo-Cothic script : LOVE NEVER ENDETH . A gravestone was ready for me , too , the last bearer of the name ; the dash after my name and birth date , that graphic " to , " had something ominous about it . Who would continue to pay the ( not inconsiderable ) lease when my earthly days were done ? Margret , probably . She was a woman in good health , well off , childless , a tea drinker , a moderate smoker , and in the melody of her handwriting , particularly in the small d , I could perceive a long life for her . I stood behind the tamarisk hedge , now grown quite dense , that separated the Zerhoff burial plot from ours , and then I saw her : she seemed more attractive than ever , more so than the girl of fifteen with whom I had lain in the grass , more so than the woman of twenty , thirty , and thirty-five with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last one fifteen years ago in Sinzig when she turned on her heel outside the hotel room and drove away ; she had n't even allowed me to take her to the station . She must be close to fifty now , her thick , rather coarse blond hair had turned an attractive gray , and black suited her . As children we had often had to come out here on summer evenings to water the flowers : my brother Josef , Margret , myself , and her brother Franzi , into whose grave the last members of the cortege where just then throwing their flowers or their shovelfuls of earth ; the familiar drumming of earth on wood , the impact of the bunches of mimosa like the alighting of a bird . Often we had spent our streetcar money on ice cream , setting out on the tong homeward journey on foot and , in the summer heat , soon regretting our recklessness , but invariably Josef had produced some hidden " reserves " and paid our fareshome , and on the streetcar , relieved and tired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice cream or our fares . I still had to fight hack my tears when I thought of Josef , and I still did n't know , after thirty-four years I did n't know , whether it was his death or his last wish that brought tears to my eyes . At the very end of the platform , beyond the station roof , before the arrival of the leave train , we had once again discussed ways and means of not returning to the front , fever , accident , medical certificates and in the end it was Margret who broke the taboo and spoke of  --  what do they call it ? ? " desertion , " and Father had stamped his foot in rage and said : " There is no such thing as desertion in our family ! " and Josef had laughed and said : " Where to ? Am I supposed to swim across the Channel or to Sweden , or across Lakc Constance to Switzerland  --  and Vladivostok , you know , is a pretty long way off , " and he was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistle , when he leaned down once more and said clearly , more to me than to my father : " Please , no priests at my grave , no mumbo jumbo at any memorial service . " He was nineteen , had given up the study of theology , and Margret was at that time considered almost his fiancee . We never saw him again . We winced , I more than my father , Margret less , as if whipped by his last words ; and of course , when the news of his death arrived , I reminded Father of Josef 's last wish , not repeating his words , I was too scared to do that , but simply saying : " You know what he asked for , what his last wish was . " But Father had waved me away and , I need hardly say , not done as Josef had asked . They had indeed had their memorial service , with incense , Latin , and catafalque ; in solemn pomp they had executed their precise choreography , in their black , gold-embroidered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choir of theology students who sang something in Greek . The Eastern Churches were already becoming very fashionable . I have never entered a church since , except as an acolyte and in my later capacity as salesman of devotional supplies ; and when Franzi Zerhoff and I had assisted at solemn requiems , they had sometimes reminded me , in their heavy , gold-embroidered brocade robes , of Soviet marshals with their bulky gold shoulder pieces and their chests covered with about a hundred and fifty decorations . Always plenty of Latin , male choir in red-and-white sashes , top hats trem-Ming in their hands , and the air trembling with the vehemence of their chest tones . ARGRET 'S MOUTH was surprisingly small and still not hard under her austere nose ; she was slimmer , only her wrists revealed traces of plumpness . There she stood , dignified , erect , shaking hands , nodding , yet she had kept that swift , ephemeral , springy quality . The gray around her head reminded me of the whitish gray dust in her hair when we staggered out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grass , came together on that June night after saying goodbye to Josef , when so many values and so much that was valuable had been destroyed ; and I thought of the dust in her kisses , in her tears , of our irresponsible laughter when Father also came staggering out of the house and saw us lying there , and how our dust-powdered faces screwed up with laughter when he twisted the key to his safe in the air as if it , the air , contained his securities and all that notarized stuff ; and of course he did n't know , none of us knew , that in this so charmingly conventional war degrees of heat would build up that venerable safes could not withstand . And in the end , when later they were poking through the debris , he had found nothing but ashes in his molten safe , and it had been Margret , not I ( who was of course familiar with such sayings ) , who told him : " Memento , quia pulvis es et ... , " but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were inseparable , but we never came together again , not even with a kiss , not even with a handclasp . Margret turned toward me and , in a kind of bitter joy , her woman 's face changed to the face of that girl who , with me , had scorned accepted values on that June night  --  or had I then embraced the Margret of today , had I at last caught up with her , she with me ? Had Josef 's curse at last truly united us ? I thought of him , of the whiplash with which he had changed the course of my life , and I realized here , at last . that that was what he had wanted : to change the course of my life , away from gold brocade , male choirs , family graves , real and potential knights of Catholic orders . Perhaps that was the only thing he had learned in that gloriously conventional war , and today , here , facing Margret , I had no reason to bear a grudge against him on that score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against my father , who later becamevery silent , almost humble , and who always looked so expectantly at me when Margret came over from next door . We used to go to the movies , to the theater , for walks , we had long discussions  --  but we never got as far as even a handclasp , even a flicker of memory . I carried on as an acolyte , regarding it as a job ( tips and free meals ) ; I got into the black market , finished high school , left home , and , via the black market , ended up in the devotional-supplies business when I was asked to get hold of a Leonardo da Vinci print for a Moselle vintner 's first communion in exchange for butter , and did so . I had a few affairs , and I imagine Margret did , too . I WAS STANDING close enough to be able to read the word " Blackbird " from Margret 's lips . I nodded , withdrew , and headed for the " Blackbird , " where funeral receptions have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back to the exit , cross the street , and walk for five minutes through Douglas hrs . At the " Blackbird " they were already busy cutting up limp rolls , spreading them with butter , adding slices of sausage or cheese , and decorating them with mayonnaise . I wondered whether Aunt Marga was still alive , she had always insisted on having blood sausage with onion rings , as greedily as if she were starving , although everyone knew that not even she had any idea of the extent of her fortune . The coffee machine was steaming , brandy snifters were being placed on trays , freshly opened bottles beside them ( Margret was sure to have firmly insisted on a price " by the bottle " ) , bottles of mineral water were being snapped open , flowers stuck in little vases . Still the same old , old-fashioned routine . I recognized the priest , who had arrived without the acolytes and was sitting in a corner smoking a cigar with a contented , off-duty expression . He nodded at me . Not because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like a nice fellow , I sat down at his table and asked him about the special carrying case for the collapsible cross : in my days as an acolyte we used to have to lug the whole cross around , and it had always been a problem getting it into a car without smashing a window or knocking top hats off heads . And I knew of a few rural communities where the old processional cross was still in use . lie told me the name of the company , I jotted it down on my return ticket , then we both speculated as to why people continued to put up with those limp rolls . I told him that even as children we had called those sandwiches " Blackbird pasteboard with mayonnaise , " whether we were present as mourners or acolytes or  --  as frequently happened  --  as mourning acolytes . They were behind the times , there should be " Hawaiian Toast " or something , and sherry , not brandy , and not Persian lamb coats but mink , and instead of the lousy coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everywhere ? ? they should have ordered mocha , which did sometimes turn out like reasonably good coffee . I glanced at my return ticket , where I had noted the trains : 14:22 , 15:17 , then none till 17:03 ; it was now just on eleven , and if I wanted to take Margret along , if I wanted , after thirty-four years , to touch her hair that evening , I supposed I would have to stay on a while and run the risk of encountering a former schoolmate or two among the red-andwhite sashes , maybe even among the Catholic knights : one of them was sure to shout the opening lines of The Odyssey  --  in Greek , of course  --  into my ear , to prove that his classical education had not failed to leave its mark on him . Another , although we had graduated from high school more than thirty years ago and not seen each other since , taking it for granted that I would fully agree , would start moaning about modern times , about his spoiled brats , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was working himself to death in his practice while his third or fourth apartment building was costing him more and more due to this damned inflation . I was prepared to endure this ; I knew this kind of talk from funerals I had attended not as a mourner but professionally : I also have an agency for gravestones , and my top hat counts as professional clothing and is tax-deductible . It could n't take all that long : if we missed the 2:22 we would certainly catch the 3:17 . I WAS IN LUCK , it was Bertholdi who sat down beside me . I recalled that in eight years of school I had n't exchanged so much as forty words with him . There had been simply no occasion to do so , and I had reason to regret this now . He was a very nice fellow , without that bitter-sour expression that seems inevitable with successful as well as unsuccessful men at the start of the last third of their lives . Bertholdi asked how my business was going , and when I told him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he remarked that it must be hard going in this post  --  Vatican Council era . I agreed that business had taken a beating , but I could also report a certain upswing , and when he mentioned " Lefebvre ? " I nodded but also shook my head . His shrewd question could be answered only partially in the affirmative : there was also , I said , independently of the person he had named , a return to the traditional that expressed itself in top hats , bridal trains , elaborate celebrations of first communions , confirmations , and weddings , and in its wake helped the sale of modern devotional supplies , well-crafted icon copies , for instance , in fact anything smacking of the Eastern Churches . Because he spoke so nicely about his wife and children , I volunteered the information that , together with some business associates , I was engaged in opening up a new market for good icon reproductions : the Soviet Union , which we were supplying  --  illegally , of course  --  with excellent reproductions that were mounted over there on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by skilled craftsmen , and for which there was a good demand . Since artists , craftsmen , and dealers naturally preferred foreign currency , quite a few of these reproductions were finding their way back via the tourist black market . Not exactly sharing in the profits , but doing its best to help , was an organization calling itself " Pictures for the Eastern Churches " ; too many Soviet citizens in all the republics had sold off their family icons and now , caught up in the religious wave , found themselves without pictures . And , inwardly uneasy because Margret was still moving around and had not yet sat down , I went on to tell Bertholdi the trade 's classic story of that long-dead colleague who , putting his trust in the religious currents prevalent during World War I , found himself stuck with some 10.000 portraits of Pope Benedict XV and lacked the financial and mental resources to save his business by profiting from the long reigns of the two Piuses . When asked by Bertholdi whether I would still invest much in Paul VI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; as a dealer in devotional supplies , no , " adding that the only pope who had remained in demand after his death was John XXIII . Bertholdi thanked me for this insight into the " subtleties " of my business and returned the compliment with an autobiographical sketch : he was a senior official in the ethic ?

At last Margret came and sat down beside me , beckoned to a waitress to bring me a little pot of mocha , placed her hand on my arm , and said : " I remember how you hate bad coffee , and " ? she did n't take away her hand ? " just now , when I saw you standing there , it occurred to me , after all these years it occurred to me , that he did n't curse God at all . " " No , " I said , " it was only those cursed by God whom he cursed . And that curse was the blessing that he gave us . " Willi Offermann , seated across from us next to the priest , tried to bait me by speaking of Jerusalem and the Holy Sepulchre , and of people who had no religion yet lived very well off it . Did he mean me , or the dealers in devotional supplies in Jerusalem ? Do I have no religion and live very well off it ? Roth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live off it , but not as well as he seemed to believe , not even my gravestone agency brought in much , although I can offer the latest designs and good African stones ; and sometimes when I was checking a new shipment of rosaries for which there was no longer much demand , at least not at the moment , in spite of Lefebvre ) , I would grasp one and recite the entire rosary . So as not to be looking constantly at Margret , who had got up again to tell a waiter carrying a plate of onion rings and slices of blood sausage to take it over to where Aunt Marga was indeed sitting , I looked at Offermann 's wife : she was next to the priest and leaning across him in an effort to calm down her husband on the other side when Offermann suddenly raised his voice and started abusing the " Red scum ! " ? which was nonsense , because he had n't seen me for thirty-one years and could have no idea whether I was red or green ; besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sensible dealer in devotional supplies  --  and that 's what I was  --  would ever vote for any party without the prefix " Christian . " This was so obvious that he could have saved himself Iris uninformed provocation ; I behaved as if he certainly could n't mean me and smiled at his wife , who looked so nice that he could n't possibly have deserved her . T HEN MARGRET was beside me again , pouring mocha and remembering that I took whipped cream with it ; she had brought over a little dish of it . She smelled of soap , toilet water , and perspiration , a smell that I perceived as familiar  --  yet it could n't possibly be familiar to me . It was as if we had spent these thirty-four years together , her years becoming mine , a common tally of the years : some things neglected but nothing missed . I found her much more beautiful than on that June night ; actually she had never been a beauty , she had always seemed like a girl who had been bicycling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never been on a bicycle . As I looked at her she became younger and younger , until I could see her playing ball on the path between our two houses , flushed , eager , yet quiet , and she was , after all , the first and only woman from whose lips I had heard the word desertion . She kept her hand on my arm , and Offermann grew even angrier , prophesying doom , and seeming to hold me , me personally , responsible for the simultaneous decline in morals and faith ; and not even when he spoke of my brother Josef ( " Of course , if your brother Josef were still alive , but then the best always get killed ! " ) did I allow myself to he provoked into saying something like : You did n't get killed either , nor did Margret ? who turned pale and whose hand on my arm was trembling . Finally Offermann attacked the priest , whom he accused of being too passive , and it was I who , in order to calm him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him across the table . That actually had an effect : his face relaxed , and his wife smiled at me gratefully ; the priest was relieved . I had looked at the time and found it was only twelve o'clock and that we would be able to catch the 2:22 , and during my Homer recitation I thought of coffee and cakes on the train , thought of the crowded dining car , which was now moving beside the Rhine toward the Lorelei rock , and that prob . ably they still served nothing but that seer rake that was enough to choke a person . Bul it was a long time since I had last ridden it the dining car in the afternoon , I merely re membered that Margret liked that damn cake Once , on the train to Sinzig , she had told rm it reminded her of a deceased aunt of whom she had been very fond . I beckoned to fir waitress and asked her to order me a taxi In a quarter to two . C         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
