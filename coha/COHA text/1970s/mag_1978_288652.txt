THE NEW INDIA by Ved Mehta Viking ; 174 pages ; $10 <P> The remarkably high quality of India 's first generation of leadership long obscured a simple fact : the nature of that nation 's democracy depends largely on what the leadership cares to impose . It has the power to foster democratic institutions ; it also has the capacity for tyranny . <P> India 's reputation as " the world 's largest democracy " perished abruptly on June 26 , 1975 , when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi , the imperious daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru , imposed a " state of emergency , " curtailed civil liberties and imprisoned tens of thousands of people , including hundreds of her political opponents . But if Indian democracy had been destroyed in a single night , it was miraculously reborn only 21 months later when Mrs. Gandhi and her Congress Party were overwhelmingly defeated at the polls . <P> In The New India , a collection of articles he wrote for The New Yorker , Ved Mehta traces the corrosive effect of unchallenged political power during what he calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was born in India but has lived in the U.S. for many years , recognized from the beginning how dangerous a path Mrs. Gandhi had chosen . By her action , he wrote , " she risked making it possible for politicians , much more ruthless and power-hungry than she , one day to dislodge her and perpetrate abuses of power previously unimagined . " <P> From the start she confounded her enemies , a group that included " some of the wisest old tortoises of Indian politics . " Her lieutenants grew fond of saying , " India is Indira and Indira is India . " It is clear that she came to believe it too . But as a dictator she was hopelessly flawed , a lonely woman who turned more and more to her own family , particularly her zealous younger son Sanjay . " She could not escape her Nehru heritage , " writes Mehta , " including her Nehru conscience . " Incredibly , she did not realize , or perhaps refused to believe , the extent to which the enforced sterilization campaign and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so she made the political mistake of her life , calling the elections that summoned her defeat . Had she not done so , the fate of Indian democracy might have been far different . <P> If , as Mehta has observed , " anything would be better than the dictatorship of the emergency , " it does not follow that India 's problems have been solved with the election of Morarji Desai as Prime Minister . Mrs. Gandhi 's family-planning program was often harshly applied . But the sterilizations ( 8 million in her last year of power ) were a human effort to deal with crushing statistics : India 's population ( now over 620 million ) will reach 1 billion by the year 2000 . During Desai 's first nine months in office , on the other hand , there were only 636,000 sterilizations , the lowest rate in a decade . The threat of dictatorship has receded , but the conflict between traditional democracy and the things India must do to save itself remains unresolved . <P> - William E.
