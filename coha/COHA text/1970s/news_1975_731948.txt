txt THERE IS A lunch stand called Rico 's at 1655 W. Roosevelt Rd. built to the specifications of a currency exchange . It is tacos and refried beans , however , that are exchanged thru the , 10-gauge steel wall separating cook from patron . The hungry customer tells Rico what he wants thru a thick pane of bulletproof glass and drops his money in a tray beneath . Moments later he gets his food via a revolving shelf . Should the customer demand dinero ( money ) instead of taco , Rico can push a button locking the front door until police arrive . Cost of Rico 's fortress : $5,000 . A SUBURBAN BUSINESS tycoon with a mortal fear of kidnaping recently built a new Wine . There are no door keys . Instead , one punches a preset code on a Touch-Tone dial in the door frame . The entrances are further guarded by closed circuit TV and intercoms . Rooms are guarded by photoelectric cells disguised as electrical outlets which at night transmit invisible light beams to detect the motion of Intruders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silently from his bedside with a hand-held device resembling a garage door activator . Cost of the system : $10,000 . SECURITY has become an acute concern of millions of Americans . It also has become big business for scads of manufacturing , distribution , and consulting firms scrambling to capture a share of the booming home and commercial market . The art of protecting life and property has come a long way from the drowsy night watchman making his rounds between peanut butter sandwiches . Brochures and catalogs offer a variety of space-age equipment , drawing on such things as infrared , solid state , microwave , and computer technology . But the experts point out there 's a need for sophisticated equipment . Professional thieves are more sophisticated , keeping pace technologically in order to thwart systems . And , as crime statistics indicate , there are more thieves . THERE ARE TWO basic kinds of security systems . The first is " perimeter " defense , or covering-the exterior of a facility to guard against entry . The second is " volume , " or spatial intrusion defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The options in these categories are almost endless . Sensor Systems , Inc. , of 2 N. Riverside Plaza , which designs and markets security systems for some of Chicago 's largest commercial and institutional clients , specializes in sophisticated gadgetry . It recently helped design a nearly foolproof perimeter system for a Chicago area plant handling nuclear materials . An impenetrable " wall " 20 feet high was created around the plant thru a series of posts , spread 500 feet apart which throw and receive infrared beams . Any large object passing thru ( a man , rather than a bird sets off the alarm . So does any attempt to tamper with the posts . THE SYSTEM is combined with a stiles of cloied circuit TV cameras , with " zoom " lensesithat can focus on a suspected intruder . Sensor also has provided many local banks , research houses , and federal offices With an " access control . " Such a system is designed to protect certain " sensitive " offices in large physical plants with many employes . Doors may be opened only with cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Touch-Tone dial . The code that will open one door will not open another . THERE ARE some other unusual security systems available to businesses , particularly for off-hour use . Take the " audio security " plan they 're eating each other . Delicious irony . Sensitive microphones , capable of picking up the sound of a pencil dropping on shag carpeting , are strategically placed and linked to a central control board in Sonic Alarm offices . A man monitors the board 24 hours a day . " We can hear a break-in . We can hear if someone hid in a closet at closing time and emerged afterwards . We can hear someone drilling thru a wall . And we can interrogate the premises , " said Charles Kiefer , the firm 's sales representative . It costs much less than paying a watchman for 16 hours a day and 48 hours over a weekend . At $5 an hour , that is about $33,000 a year . Kiefer 's service averages $1,000 a year . CHEAPER , TOO , are dogs ? fierce , trained shepherds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the foremost suppliers and trainers in the Chicago area is William Taylor of National K-9 Security in Northbrook . Taylor will come around at closing time each night and let his dogs out in your work-yard , showroom , or whatever . He picks them up again in the morning . The dogs are so mean only he and his employes can handle them , but they are not killers . They are trained to bite and hold . He puts out 47 a night , at the moment , for such customers as Hines Lumber , GrandSpanling Dodge , and Z Frank Chevrolet . Cost : about $1 an hour per dog . And Taylor asserts his canine sentinels have a " 100 per cent batting average right now . They 've caught two thieves . " Residential security Is keeping pace with commercial . Many of the new condominiums have elaborate apartment alarm systems . They also have installed closed circuit television , such as marketed by Norman Industries of Chicago , which cah provide a doorman with views of corridors , storage rooms and parking garages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These include ultrasonic devices , which work on the sonar principle , microwave and others which work on the radar principle , and various forms of light beam " electric eyes . " All have some flaws . Ultrasonic , for instance , ca n't be used in homes with a cat or dog . A ringing phone , or even the air motion of a furnace clicking on can set off false alarms with some systems . But the units are often self-contained and need no wires . Thus they are portable and can be disguised as books , wall sockets , hi-ft speakers , and lamps . They will frequently detect a slick thief who may have neutralized the perimeter system . A homeowner who decides he needs greater protection than a State Farm plan and a prayer , but does n't trust himself , can call in a consultant , such as Sentry Systems Corp. , 3829 W. Devon Av . SENTRY WILL VISIT a home and plan a custom system , using components it manufactures . It will install the gear , and if the customer wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system can be wired to a police station , orsimply touch off an unearthly noise to scare the intruder away . Arnold E. Miller , Sentry vice president , said his chief clients are the very wealthy ? as expected ? and ghetto residents , who are so fearful of break-ins they will use a time payment plan to have a good system installed . What about the working or middle-class homeowners ? You 'd think they 'd want to make their homes impregnable . " Not so , " Miller said . The Archie Bunker type keeps a gun under his pillow . He says , Let ' em come . I want to catch ' em myself . ' " MILLER 'S CLIENTS include some of Chicago 's ritziest people . One , for example , has a set of Chagall originals , so Miller wired each painting to trigger an alarm if it is lifted from the wall . In several cases , he not only monitors a family 's Winnelka home , but also its Florida winter house , and Acapulco condo . He does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at about $800 and soar from there . The main cost in home security is installation , with labor charges far exceeding the cost of parts . One company helping homeowners get around this is GC Electronics , of Rockford , which markets a line of do-it-yourself security products . These are solid-state devices ? long-lasting battery powered units about the size of transistor radios ? that hook up easily by doors and windows with few wires . " We want to sell simple , straightforward stuff , " said EA Crockett , GC vice president . FOR THE absolutely nonhandy , or simply lazy , Crockett recommends GC 's portable ultrasonic gizmo disguised as a stereo speaker , which emits inaudible sound waves that pick up motion , a la sonar . It requires no wiring and can be used in conjunction with satellite transmitters to cover other rooms . Cost : $129 . If you have no money , but still quiver in fear , Maj. George Nonte Jr . U.S. Army , ret.1 has some Rube Goldberg-style advice . In his book , " To Stop a Thief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I once rigged for a friend a holder for a can of Mace on the inside of an apartment door , combined with a simple plywood bell-crank . . . . If the door was opened with the trip wire connected , a spray of Mace was I discharged thru a small plastic tube passing thru the door . . . . The same belicrank also turned on a floodlight outside the door , and at the same time activated a simple doorbell in the bedroom . . . . Any intruder attempting to force that door would be simultaneously Maced and illuminated , and the alarm buzzer would alert the occupant . . . . "
