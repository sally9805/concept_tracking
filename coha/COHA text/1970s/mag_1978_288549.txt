One of the great dramas of history was enacted between the 3rd and 7th centuries A.D. : the slow collapse of Rome , the fading of its empire and , with it , the death of the classical world . The age of Christianity was officially brought to term when the Emperor Constantine formally embraced the new faith and in A.D. 324-330 moved the capital of the Roman Empire from Rome to Constantinople . But across the still vast spread of the imperial territories , which ran from the Euphrates to Gibraltar , there was no clean break with the old religions . For 400 years , the remnants of the pagan gods contended against Christianity and with the various mystery faiths of Egypt and Asia Minor . <P> The eddies set up by the gradual transference of power from Olympus to Golgotha were reflected in art . Some of the complexity of late classical and early Christian centuries can be sampled in a huge exhibition , which opened last month at New York 's Metropolitan Museum of Art . " Age of Spirituality , " assembled under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificent compendium of some 450 works in every medium known to the ancient world-marble carvings , glass , gold , jewelry , silver , paint , cameos , cloth , mosaic , ivory , bronze . <P> No religion ever started with a full-blown iconography . The earliest Christian work was crude and secretive , a code of graffiti-crosses and fish scratched on walls . To enrich that , to give its visual discourse a dignity to match imperial power , Christian art needed pagan symbolism . Once its early frenzies over idolatry had been resolved , the new religion picked over the bones of antiquity , preserving many of its forms in doctrinal art but switching their meaning . <P> The classical figure of the philosopher , Plato or Seneca , among his students was pressed into service as Christ teaching.The gestures of Ciceronian rhetoric lent authority to the poses of carved apostles ; Orpheus with a ram on his shoulders was transformed into Christ the good shep herd . Winged victories became angels . Bacchus turned into the drunken Noah ; a late 3rd century carving of Jonah resting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image of Endymion asleep . The more refined an early Christian work was , the more subtly it might display its classical affiliations .
