Economics + Computers = $$$ for Eckstein <P> " Let 's see , " says Otto Eckstein entrepreneurial economist , " how many clients are speaking with our computer at this moment . " The good doctor presses a shiny gray key of a Burroughs 7700 computer , and out whirs the answer : 113 . Then he touches another key , and the computer spits the names of those 113 paying customers . Among them are the departments of State , Treasury , Commerce and Justice and two dozen other federal agencies . Then there are Morgan Guaranty , Bank of America , Citibank and a score more banks , and American Can , Dow Chemical , Exxon , Shell , among many other industrial giants . <P> In scarcely eight years in business , Eckstein has recruited 520 such clients , including two-thirds of the 100 largest U.S. manufacturers , most of the big banks , and plenty of brokerages , utilities , state agencies and , increasingly , foreign governments and corporations . At any time of day , 70 to 120 of them are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer at Data Resources , Inc. , of Lexington , Mass. , of which Eckstein is cofounder , president and largest shareholder . <P> The questions put to DRI 's computer range from economic esoterica ( " What is the price of strawberries in Manitoba ? " ) to the effects of broad economic trends on specific products ( " How will the change in personal income for August alter the price of chlorine ? " ) . Eckstein , a member of TIME 'S Board of Economists , has the answers because he has built by far the world 's largest bank of economic statistics-more than 3.5 million series of figures about the U.S. and 127 other countries . These data are constantly updated by his staff of 250 economists and analysts from the huge mass of numbers put out free by governments , associations and corporations . Then the figures are fed into the most capacious computer that Burroughs has ever sold . Eckstein 's econometric models , based on thousands of mathematical equations , produce not only forecasts of growth , inflation , interest rates and the like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and products . The predictions change as new indicators are reported or major political developments occur . For example , 72 hours after the Arab oil embargo struck in 1973 , Data Resources forecast just how much insurance companies ' profits would surge because driving-and accidents - would decline . <P> With fees from these prophecies , personal consulting and other services , DRI 's revenues rose 35% last year , to just over $17 million , and profits climbed 70% , to $1,502,000 ; they are growing somewhat faster this year . That has made Eckstein , at 50 , probably the richest American economist . Since DRI went public last November , the shares have bucked the bear market and risen from $11.50 to $18 bid , giving Eckstein and his family a stake of more than $4 million .
