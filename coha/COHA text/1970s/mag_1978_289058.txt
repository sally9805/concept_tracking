A trend worrying doctors <P> In the 3rd century B.C. , the Greek anatomist Erasistratus noticed that the liver of a man dead of dropsy was as hard as stone but that of a man who had died of snakebite was soft . So physicians have long known that examining the dead could provide valuable information for the living . By the 20th century , the post-mortem examination , or autopsy ( from the Greek for seeing with one 's own eyes ) , had become a routine medical procedure . Yet since the end of World War II there has been a sharp reversal , and the autopsy itself appears to be dying . In 1950 nearly half of all patients who died in hospitals were autopsied . Now the figure has dropped to about 20% . <P> The autopsy is not performed merely to establish the cause of death . It is also of enormous importance in helping define the course of diseases and in evaluating the effectiveness of new therapies . Not the least of its benefits , especially if a child has died , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing that the family was in no way responsible . <P> If autopsies are so valuable , why are they being abandoned ? For one thing , they cost from $500 to $1,200 , which is usually borne by the hospital itself . For another , there is not much pressure to do them . In 1971 the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals dropped its recommendation that hospitals autopsy at least 20% to 25% of their deaths . Also , fewer families seem to be giving their consent , partly on the advice of morticians who see autopsies as a delay and hindrance to embalming . <P> Physicians too have become autopsy-shy . As Dr. William Masters , chief of anatomic pathology at Atlanta 's Emory University Hospital , points out : " Medicine in general is more interested in the living , for whom it can perhaps still do something . " And in an age of malpractice suits , doctors may also fear what an autopsy will reveal about their skills and judgment . <P> Some argue that because of new diagnostic tools like computerized X-ray scanners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death . Says Ralph Greene , pathologist at Chicago 's Portes Cancer Prevention Center : " Most autopsies these days are useless . " <P> Many pathologists disagree . Says Dr. Nancy Warner of Los Angeles County-Southern California Medical Center : " Everyone is dead certain they know what a patient has , and on autopsy it turns out to be something else . " Several studies have shown that in about 25% of autopsied cases , the post-mortem findings do not agree with the major clinical diagnoses made while the patient was alive . That does not necessarily mean that the doctor was careless , only that certain ailments , like cancer of the pancreas or bacterial infections in heart valves , are extremely difficult to diagnose . Thus , without verification by autopsy , the information on the death certificate-and , consequently , national disease statistics-are only informed guesses . <P> Beyond all this , the autopsy is a benchmark for medical performance . As Pathology Chief Dante Scarpelli of Chicago 's Northwestern Memorial Hospital explains : " A careful autopsy is the very best quality control instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor from quietly burying his mistakes .
