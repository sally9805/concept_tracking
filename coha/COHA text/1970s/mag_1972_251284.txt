THE angry fates attending Northern Ireland conspired again last week to plunge that unhappy province back over the brink of violence . For nearly a month since Britain 's takeover of direct rule , Ulster 's Catholics had wavered between supporting the outlawed Irish Republican Army and coming to terms with the British . But the nascent good will toward London for replacing the hated Protestant-dominated Parliament at Stormont was clearly a fragile feeling . Almost any incident could spark a renewed flare-up of hatred in the Catholic community-and last week , with a certain inevitability , that flare-up was touched off . By a single death , the I.R.A . gained a martyr , and the British were put on the verge of losing their latest bid to bring peace to bloody Ulster . <P> The dead man was Joseph McCann , 25 , commander of the first battalion of the I.R.A . ' s Marxist-leaning Official wing in Belfast . A semilegendary hero to the I.R.A . gunmen , he had eluded capture by the British for more than two years-a fact that spawned his nickname @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had shot as many as 15 British soldiers . McCann 's luck ran out when police plainclothesmen spotted him in a narrow Belfast thoroughfare called Joy Street . As he tried to run , he was shot and killed by soldiers . <P> Catholic eyewitnesses contended that McCann-who was unarmed at the time-was first shot in the legs and then murdered , with at least ten shots pumped into his body . The British army declined comment , pending an inquest . <P> Public Drama . The I.R.A . extracted a maximum of public drama from his funeral . Gunmen patrolled the Turf Lodge area of West Belfast where McCann 's body lay in state in an apartment . The Irish News ran an entire page of messages of sympathy , many from interned I.R.A . fighters . An estimated 2,000 mourners-including black-bereted I.R.A . fighters and uniformed girls of the Fianna na Eireann , a sort of junior I.R.A.-marched in the funeral cortege , while another 3,000 watched from the sidewalks . Civil Rights Firebrand Bernadette Devlin , who had been sentenced in absentia the day before to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march in February ( but still had 14 days to appeal ) , turned up to march in the procession . <P> McCann was buried in an I.R.A . plot in Belfast 's big Catholic cemetery , next to the graves of two teen-agers who were killed when a bomb they were making exploded last year . Around the grave was a huge pile of flowers , and all 21 I.R.A . companies stood silently at attention as a bugler sounded the Last Post . Cathal Goulding , the Dublin-based chief of staff of the I.R.A . Officials , delivered the funeral oration . Clad in a red sweater , his long hair blowing in the breeze , Goulding declaimed that McCann had been " shot like a dog by the agents of imperialism . "
