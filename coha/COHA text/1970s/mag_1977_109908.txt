The night brought back memories . The 19,694 in Madison Square Garden , the first capacity crowd since the Knicks ' championship year of 1973 , worked itself into a lather as the game seesawed through the fourth quarter and into overtime . Then , right on cue , Walt Frazier  --  " Clyde "  --  did his patented last-minute clutch number , just as he so often had . When his team 's six-point lead suddenly shrank to three with 1:50 left , Frazier took the ball upcourt and went straight for the basket , spinning in a layup , drawing a foul and coverting the free throw for a three-point play . Then , just to make certain , he leaped up on defense and deflected a pass to a teammate , and as the final seconds ticked away , raised his fists in triumph and grinned broadly . The crowd went wild . Another classic Frazier finish . // Except that for the first time in 11 seasons at the Garden , Frazier was dressed in an enemy uniform , and his vintage game  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assists  --  produced a 117-112 victory for his new team , the Cleveland Cavaliers , over the New York Knicks , whom he had helped win NBA championships in 1970 and 1973 . Seventeen days earlier the Knicks had sent the quintessential New Yorker off to Cleveland as compensation for signing 28-year-old free-agent Guard Jim Cleamons. // Before the game Frazier admitted having butterflies  --  uncharacteristic for the original Mr. Cool . " I never thought to check when I 'd be coming back to play in New York , " he said . " I had no idea it would be this soon until I got a letter from a friend that said ' See you next week . ' I thought , ' Wow , I 'm not ready for that yet . ' " The seven-time All-Star , once the cynosure of all New York , or so it seemed , had heard boos in the Garden in the past two non-winning , non-playoff seasons , and he was not sure how the crowd would greet him . But even before his name was called in the introductions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frazier got a three-minute standing ovation . The cheers , the attention and then the game left Frazier ecstatic . // " I thought the ovation would go on all night , " he said afterward . " Tonight I was the greatest . They still love me. " // After the game Clyde 's fans and friends filled his old haunts  --  Harry M 's , P. J. Clarke 's , Maxwell 's Plum  --  waiting for Clyde to come celebrating , as he always had after a triumphant night . But this night Frazier was no more than a visitor to the city . After talking to reporters for nearly two hours he went straight to the apartment he still keeps on East 57th Street and  --  exhausted and alone  --  went to bed . // The next morning , as he was sauntering through LaGuardia Airport to catch the plane back to Cleveland , a man approached him and asked facetiously . " Are n't you Reggie Jackson ? " // Frazier laughed . " Today I am . " Then he caught himself . " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // He had with him half a dozen pieces of luggage , filled with whatever items from his legendary wardrobe he had been able to stuff into them . " Just casual things , " he said . " Leathers , slacks , shirts , some shoes . No suits . And two furs , for when it snows . I want to be ready . " // Left behind in New York : the burgundy-and-beige 1965 Rolls-Royce , which was being overhauled ( " I was n't sure how good the service would be out there , " he said ) , the famous round bed with the $3,500 mink spread , the pool table , the closetsful of clothes , not to mention the $150,000 seven-room , five-bath 45th-floor co-op apartment . // Until he finds something to replace that layout , Frazier is living with Cavalier Center Jim Chones , his wife Elores and their 16-month-old daughter Kareeda in a four-bedroom split level in suburban Beachwood , 25 minutes from the Coliseum , which itself is some 25 miles southeast of Cleveland in the town of Richfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after three nights in a Holiday Inn . // Such gestures , plus the respect shown him by the young Cavaliers and Coach Bill Fitch , have made Frazier feel wanted for the first time in two years . Relaxing at the Choneses a couple of days after the game against the Knicks , he talked about his circumstances , accepting them without complaint but still not understanding the Garden boos or why the New York press had made him the whipping boy for the Knicks ' failures . // " I guess the cool image started working against me , " he finally said . " When we won , people said , " Frazier 's cool , he never shows emotion . ' When we lost , they said , ' Look at Frazier , he does n't care . ' The whole team changed into a group of individuals . I was the star , so I got the blame . " Frazier laughed . " I was damned if I did and damned if I didn't. " // The problems began two seasons ago when Frazier missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blowing , " he said . " I was down and out and every time I picked up the paper I saw ' The Knicks are 4-1 without Clyde . ' " Upon his return Frazier became almost reclusive , practicing yoga at home , changing his diet to include predominantly fruits and salads laced with wheat germ oil and powdered calcium , eating meat only on game days . Since then , he maintains , his mind and body have never been better conditioned . // But his once idyllic relationship with the press began to deteriorate . Last February he lost his starting job temporarily . then resigned the team captaincy . Reporters , fans , even his own teammates felt that he was sulking . " The way I play , it sometimes looks like I 'm loafing , " said Frazier , " but I want to win . I was unhappy , but it was because I was forced into keeping quiet . That 's not me. " // In training camp this season with the Knicks , Frazier was in shape and performing well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to Cleveland , his backcourt mate Earl Monroe acknowledged that it was probably best for the team . " Maybe it is n't good for the rookies to have him around , " said Monroe . " Maybe they should get rid of me , too . " // There is no lingering bitterness on Frazier 's part . " It was a perfect marriage , " he says . " They got two championships and I got fame and fortune . What more could I do in New York ? " // A senior team official did not feel so bad either . " We should have gotten rid of Frazier two years ago , " he said . " If we still had him , we 'd be the same team we were last year . " The Knicks wanted to move Frazier badly enough to agree to assist Cleveland in paying his $400,000 annual salary for the next three years  --  that in addition to paying Cleamons $275,000 a year . // The way things have worked out delights Fitch . " In my opinion Frazier is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , " he says . " The worst that can happen is that Frazier will never beat me again . He is perfect for our game , which is a setup offense and team defense , the way the Knicks were . I have no doubts about him . You look at a classic Rolls-Royce with lots of miles on it and you know it does n't want to be put away in a garage . He 's my Rolls-Royce , and I think you 'll see him rolling with the best for a longtime yet . " // Fitch says the first time Frazier practiced with the team " my assistant and I walked away feeling like we 'd been to a coaching clinic . He showed everything he can do . Everything . " Frazier 's role is to steady the young Cavs and take charge in crucial spots , just as he did in the game at New York . Fourth-year Guard Foots Walker is the ball handler  --  " I like that , " says Frazier , " anybody gives me the ball I give it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shoots off picks set by Forwards Campy Russell and Jim Brewer , using his classic haaang-in-the-air pullup jumpers. // He hit 19 points a game in the Cavs ' first six games , right around his career average , playing just under 38 minutes . He will take points away from veteran shooting Guard Austin Carr and swingman Bingo Smith but his passing will probably mean more points for Russell , now hitting at a 22.3 clip . So far everyone is glad to have Frazier , and Fitch is convinced that he , Fitch , is a genius . // Not that the way has been totally smooth . " I hope I prove Fitch right , " Frazier said before Thursday 's game against Kansas City . But that night he made Fitch look like a dunce as the Cavs staggered through a 119-104 whipping by the Kings . Frazier 's shooting was off in the first half , and in one 17-second stretch he committed two sloppy fouls . Fitch had to sit him down . In the second half Frazier scored 11 points but was repeatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death tonight , " said Fitch . " If he went out tonight he 'd get mugged . By a one-armed cripple . " But two nights later against Boston he was the old Clyde again , giving the Coliseum folks a 22-point show as the Cavs knocked off the Celtics 103-98. // By week 's end Frazier still had hardly seen anything of Ohio except for the Coliseum , the airport and Chones ' house . He had not been anywhere near a nightspot or downtown Cleveland . Such time as he had , he spent house hunting . " People in New York make Cleveland out to be Siberia , " he was saying , " but I 'm going to like it here . When I think about it , what is there in New York to miss ? The traffic ? The concrete ? The hassles ? The cost of living and the taxes are lower here . I 'll save money . And I 'm a different Clyde now . I 'm not the guy who 's into nightclubs every night . I like being by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An attractive real-estate agent took him on a dizzying tour of houses and condominiums in suburbs like Beachwood , Shaker Heights , Lyndhurst and Pepper Pike , all of which are at least 25 minutes from the Coliseum and 45 from the airport . " But right near the freeway , " she kept saying . " I can see I 'm going to have to get me a chauffeur , " said Frazier . She showed him a $150,000 ranch house . " Could n't get half my furniture in there , " he said . Then another , on a one-acre tract . " I thought I 'd be able to get some land , have some room . Man , 150 grand in Cleveland and this is all you get ? " She suggested he might want to look at Senator Howard Metzenbaum 's palatial home , a steal at $550,000 . " Three years . That 's how long I plan to be here . Not a lifetime , " said Frazier . Finally he looked at one of the area 's plushest condominiums . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a dozen closets . Could n't get the round bed through the door . " He was still smiling . // " Ah , but look at the view , " she said , ushering him to a window overlooking magnificent red-and golden-hued rolling woods . // " You call that a view ? " said Frazier . " I 'm used to looking out on the greatest city in the world . " // " Wa-alt , " said the woman a trifle impatiently . " This is not New York . " // " I 'm hip , " said Clyde .
