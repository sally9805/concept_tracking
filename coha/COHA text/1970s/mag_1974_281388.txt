Males do not represent two discrete populations , heterosexual and homosexual . Not all things are black nor all things white . The living world is a continuum in each and every one of its aspects . The sooner we learn this concerning human sexual behavior the sooner we shall reach a sound understanding of the realities of sex . <P> So in his famous book , Sexual Behavior in the Human Male , Alfred Kinsey explained why it is that some men - perhaps 18% of them-engage about equally in homosexual and heterosexual activities for at least three years during their adult lives . Women , he later explained , could also be rated on a scale from exclusively heterosexual to exclusively homosexual . To people in the middle of the scale , however , Kinsey disliked applying the term bisexual . Biologically , he noted , it refers to organisms that include the anatomy of both sexes . <P> Today the word is commonly used to describe adults who have sexual relations with both males and females . And it is increasingly heard , for though there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the late ' 40s , bisexuals , like homosexuals before them , are boldly coming out of their closets , forming clubs , having parties and staking out discotheques . <P> " Very Fashionable . " When Kate Millett , author of the bestselling Sexual Politics , acknowledged to a meeting of feminists and Gay Liberationists in 1970 that although married , she also enjoyed lesbian relationships , the news caused a sensation both within and without the women 's movement . Millett 's latest book , Flying , to be published in June , will tell all about her bisex life to an audience not so shockable . They have by now seen movies like Sunday , Bloody Sunday , in which a male lover is shared by Glenda Jackson and Peter Finch . They have read books like the bestseller . Portrait of a Marriage , in which Nigel Nicolson tells about the affairs that his happily married mother , Poet Vita Sackville-West , had with Novelists Violet Trefusis and Virginia Woolf . Other women , living and dead , whose bisexuality has recently been made known include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bankhead and Maria ( Last Tango ) Schneider . " It has become very fashionable in elite and artistically creative subgroups to be intrigued by the notion of bisexuality , " says Psychiatrist Norman Fisk of the Gender Dysphoria Program at Stanford University Medical School . It may very well be , he added , " a sociopolitical phenomenon as much as it is a real psychiatric one . "
