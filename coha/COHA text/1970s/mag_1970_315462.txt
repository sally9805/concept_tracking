Violence is no stranger to Lawrence , a community of 40,000 in Kansas ' eastern-border country . A century ago , m the bitter Border War over whether Kansas and Nebraska would be slave or free , guerrilla bands moved back and forth across the Kansas-Missouri line , pillaging at will. * <P> Lawrence , now the home of the University of Kansas , was once more churning with violence last week . Flames lit the sky over the town , gunshots crackled in the night air . Police and National Guardsmen patrolled the streets , and nervous citizens , fearful of the new outlaws in their midst , could only watch and wonder why " Bleeding Kansas " was being bled once again . <P> Fire Bombs . The first indication that not even the conservative University of Kansas could escape the violence that has wracked other U.S. college campuses came early this month . Arsonists attempted to fire Haworth Hall , an abandoned classroom building , and threw a bomb , which failed to explode , into a bank near the university . A week later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Last week a blaze believed to be set by arsonists swept through the student union building , causing $2,000,000 in damages despite the efforts of students who helped firemen carry out art objects and furnishings . Nor did the terrorists confine their activities to arson . Snipers shot at firemen who came to fight a fire in an off-campus building , drilled three holes in a fire engine . <P> Trouble also erupted at Lawrence High School . Earlier in the month , black students aided by members of the university 's Black Student Union seized administrative offices . Among their demands were the election of two black cheerleaders , hiring of more black teachers and teachers ' aides , selection of a black homecoming queen and the addition of black studies courses . Last week their fellow students voted 924 to 167 not to accept the blacks ' demand for cheerleaders , and resentment quickly boiled over into violence . About 150 black youths , some armed with clubs and chains , gathered in a park across the street from the school , then rushed the building , breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove them back with Mace and tear gas . <P> No Explanations . State officials moved quickly to restore order . Kansas Governor Robert Docking declared a " state of public emergency " and dispatched 242 National Guardsmen and 25 state troopers to help fatigued local police enforce a dusk-to-dawn curfew . Police arrested 68 students and youths , three of them for possession of an incendiary device . Some 350 white businessmen formed an organization for better law enforcement to protect their property . <P> <P> Neither school nor law-enforcement officials were able to explain the sudden outbreak of violence . Kansas has had no recent history of radical activity ; blacks are so outnumbered that there has been little serious racial trouble . University Chancellor Laurence Chalmers , 42 , praised the students who had helped fight campus fires and denied that there was any racial organization behind the disorder . Instead , he blamed the firebombings on " pyromaniacs , " and attributed the high school disturbances to a small group of " sick if not insane people who use the cover of student unrest and political tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
