txt  | throughout succeeding centuries . They are still held up as examples of perfection . More about them later . Changes in style are imperceptible rather than abrupt . They are transitory from one reign or period into the succeeding one , as the influences of the time , the ruling class , and its designers wax and wane . After the marriage of Louis XIV to Mme. de Maintenon , the easing of severe formality and the trend toward comfort and convenience was in evidence . The heavy , fussy , pompous lines were giving way in small differences . The court was discovering that protocol could still be served with an easing in the height of chair arms and backs . The arms were set back instead of rising directly over legs , so that one need n't sit up quite so straight and rigid . The legs were beginning to have slight curves , as was the exposed woodwork of the frame under the seat . The shell motif was much in evidence along with other naturalistic designs . This phase of French design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although the style started before and continued for a time after the Duke of Orleans ' period of Regency for the young Louis XV , from 1715 to 1723 , it took its name from this short interval . The grandiose formality of the baroque was giving way to the frivolous , asymmetrical quality of the rococo . In addition to the changes already mentioned , foliage and ribbon ornamentation was used as further embellishment along with gentle curves in place of the angular lines used earlier . Wood on backs of chairs was exposed in place of the completely upholstered backs . The curve in the leg increased and feet terminated in scrolls , under which were small hexagonal bases . Around 1720 , the chairs became lighter , and the need for the X-shaped stretcher bars ceased . Upholstered arm pads appeared after the Regency , as did deep , closed arm chairs of more comfortable mien . These are called " bergeres , " and variations are produced presently to continue a very popular style .

The style was called " rococo , " from the French word " rocaille , " meaning fancy-work in rocks and shells . It was used some in the motifs of late Louis XIV ; but during the 18th century all art media embodied something of the shell design , from sculptors and painters to lamp and candlestick makers . The lavish use of C and S scrolls , slathered over ceilings , walls , picture frames , and furniture shapes , gave a look of fantasy to much of the room design of the day . As always , when the use of curvilinear lines is overdone , it departed from form , reason , and order , to become distracting and theatrical .

For many years following the French Revolution of 1789 , this conglomeration of artifice and gilt was soundly rejected , but as always in history , some of the good of the period lingered and was incorporated into contemporary design in more discreet amounts . The Hogarth curve , England 's contribution to rococo , is a major design in floral arrangements ; and even the asymmetrical design of the conch and cowrie shells finds its way back into our accessory picture today . . . pure charm in restrained usage . As glassmakers acquired the ability to make mirrors of large dimensions , these became important decorative adjuncts , and were incorporated into many designs for wall paneling . Gilt bronze chandeliers and girandoles were hung with rock crystals or glass drops so that their facets would reflect light and produce as brilliant an effect as possible . While gilded furniture remained the ultimate in luxury  | and the correct mode for state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vogue for all other rooms . Polychrome means multi-colored technique of painting , and it has been used on ceilings , ship figureheads , and panels , as well as on pieces of furniture , since the early English Renaissance . Some examples can be seen in museums today . However , the most outstanding and enduring pieces of furniture of this period known today are the great inlay works of the ebenistes ( cabinet makers ) and menuisiers ( workers in solid wood ) of the 18th century . The list of the most famous is too long to incorporate into this brief history , but they were artisans the like of which has not been surpassed since . The strong reds , yellows , and sapphire blues of the late Louis XIV period gave way as time went on to colors more delicate , and planned to harmonize with the upholstery silks used with them . Even on the gilded chairs , garlands of flowers were painted in naturalistic colors designed to bring out the carving . Around 1755-1760 , white paint without the addition of any other color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although still completely made in the Louis XV style , were painted lead white . This is the same color which after use , dust , and the patina of time became known as gray Trianon . We try to emulate it today with modern glazes . Oriental forms and lacquered surfaces became very fashionable , and commodes of this material were , and still are , considered the height of elegance and beauty . They were shortly converted by the ebenistes of France into a more popular adaptation suitable to their required sizes and color schemes . Hence you may sometime see a French piece with Chinoiserie decoration . . . a gay and charming version of the Chinese original . Although he hired many professionals to make the furniture , porcelains , etc. , of the period , Louis XV himself created a number of pieces , including the table volante ( similar to the servante mentioned earlier ) . He built with  | a passion of an extent that the treasury was seriously threatened , but unlike Louis XIV , who liked to decorate palaces , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smaller apartments of the palace , where he could entertain informally as well as devote some of his spare time to scientific research , mechanical inventions , and to his hobby of lathe turning . Country French , or French Provincial , we should mention , is the term for furniture made in the provinces of France during the various periods of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , beginning during the reign of Louis XIV . All of this extensive group was less heavily decorated and more simplified than that produced in Paris and for members of the court , but it more or less followed the lines of each representational period on through Louis XVI . The basic furniture for a French home has always been the armoire ( clothes cupboard ) , table , bed , and chair . Tabourets ( stools ) , too , continued to be popular long after chairs were common . A few of the provincial cabinet makers turned out such elegantly simple pieces that their names are still known . Others , being carpenters instead of cabinet makers , turned out cruder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of provincial veneered , inlaid , or decorated with marquetry or ornate carving . Provincial workmen used woods of the region in which they lived , hence a large variety of woods were put to use , giving a nice assortment of tones from light to dark brown in natural finishes , plus those painted a soft gray , green , or blue . To arrive at colors which pleased them , they often resorted to interesting materials to achieve them . Some of the lovely colors we admire in those antiques were made from fresh manure . Upholstery fabrics were quite likely to be gay with naturalistic flowers . Chairs often had rush seats , and incorporated the ladderback , much like the American version . Back at court , a bit of royal nepotism led eventually to another change of style . Mme. de Pompadour 's brother ,  | through her influence with the king , was appointed Director of Buildings ; and to prepare himself for this exalted post , traveled abroad with an artist of fame . This artist , Charles Cochin , later published his observations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neo-Classic style among the avant garde which eventually became the Louis XVI period . The designers at the end of the Louis XV period had begun to use the classic forms of the Grecian antiques found in the newly discovered ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum ( and reported in Cochin 's book ) . . . and here we find an overlapping of the Louis XV and XVI periods , as many " transitional " pieces had some characteristics of both . Those of late Louis XV had relatively simple marquetry bodies with bronzes decorating only the outlines and functional use of the piece , and pictorial marquetry of a semiclassical character which forecast the Louis XVI style to come . The most conspicuous changes in a Transition commode , for instance , were the rectangular carcass ( top ) , the cut corners or stiles , and the legs , which describe a more gentle curve than formerly . In fact , legs became almost straight on the inside , and showed only a very slight curve on the outside . Chairs sometimes had curved Louis XV backs and arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time , and in the early Louis XVI period , new items of furniture began to appear . One , a small upright desk , was elaborately inlaid and supplied with a cupboard or bookshelf at the back . Quantities of game tables were produced , with removable tops and storage for games beneath . A lamp was designed especially for these tables with candlesticks for the base , a metal shade , and the demiarrow finial . You will recognize this style in a present day popular desk lamp . Mahogany was the favorite wood , with brass galleries and trim . Marble tops were also much in use . All sorts of mechanical devices were invented to lift table and roll-top desk tops . The semainier was developed into the chiffonier in sizes from large to small . Round tables  | were made in every size , from the tiny candlestand type with a rachet system in the support of the bronze-galleried top , to oversize game tables , and three-tiered servantes . The oval back appeared on chairs . Chair legs , which at first had remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower motifs in the carving were replaced by pearls and ribbons . Some had lyre backs , as did some of the table bases . The arms of the straight-legged chairs were again brought forward as they had been before the Regence and Louis XV period , but often the arms themselves receded and curved between the starting point and their joining at the back . Legs were usually fluted , and terminated in small square blocks decorated with a carved rosette . Dining tables appeared in this period , and were as well-engineered for adding leaves and under support as ours today , almost 200 years later . Precious woods , straighter forms , and marquetry were some of the salient characteristics of the period . Handles were fashioned in the form of rings with beaded edges ( pearling ) , and ram 's heads and hoofs were much in evidence . Inset porcelain plaques , lacquer , and much bronze were used , as well as the unusual grain effects of inlaid mahogany . Chairs and beds were painted Trianon gray or white , sometimes with touches of green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also painted , and color prints decorated the walls for the first time . Draperies were full and luxurious ; upholstery was opulent . Alcoves were built for beds and daybeds ; their canopies sculptured in doves , arrows , and similar symbols of love which was the vogue . Some of the Egyptian inspiration , usually associated with the Empire period yet to come , appeared . Sphinxes and caryatides , as well as women 's busts , were used at the corners . From the historical point of view , the various French periods we have just reviewed have become so bound up with the reigns of the three kings of France : Louis XIV , XV , and XVI , that it is frequently difficult to realize that  | these styles and fashions often began long before , and ended long after , the rather arbitrary dates connected with them . This method only serves to approximate the style and period in which a piece of furniture may have been produced , as those pieces which have been preserved are difficult sometimes to document precisely . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to remember the century instead of exact dates . It is a curious fact worthy of note , that although a large percentage of furniture from the Louis XV and XVI periods is still intact in either museums or private collections ; that of the Louis XIV period has all but disappeared . This is because the English , after the French Revolution , bought large quantities of art works and furnishings from the Palais de Versailles , and had them shipped home . Much of the rest was destroyed in the Revolution or shortly thereafter , where rages against anything " Establishment " were rampant . Thus we move on to the Napoleonic Era and the Bourbon Restoration . The first of two periods when Napoleon was pre-eminent is distinguished by striking changes in the decoration of furniture more than over-all design . The brief Directoire period , from 1795-1804 , was a continuation of the work that went on during the Louis ' . However , it was a picturesque expression of Napoleon 's glory , and especially of his trip to Egypt . Although it lasted only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revolution , and is actually the transition between the Greek styles of late Louis XVI and the Egyptian style of the Empire periods . Wood was still mahogany , and designs had minor changes from the preceding period with added elements such as griffins , sphinxes , tripods , palmettos , fasces , and cockades used as part of the arms or legs . The tops of chairs curled backwards , sometimes with a Greek key or lyre in the back , with Egyptian goddesses supporting the arms ; all with a heavy , masculine feeling . They rather remind one of souvenirs collected from the little general 's wars . Striped silk  | upholstery was very fashionable , with the stripes much smaller than those of the preceding period , more closely spaced , and no longer interspersed with flowers . Pastel shades were replaced with bottle green , bright yellow , mulberry , and aubergine . Wallpaper came into widespread use , and incorporated the above designs and colors . When Napoleon Bonaparte ascended the throne in 1804 , the style known as Empire was born . His craving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which the greatest luxury and richness imaginable were fundamental . Massive mahogany was embellished with elaborate gilt bronzes having geometric lines ; and in order to glorify and remind his public of his Egyptian exploits , all the designs mentioned earlier were incorporated into impressive decorations . The solid mahogany pedestal base was a conspicuous new feature of the time , as was the massive mahogany bed in the form of a sleigh . While statuary marble had been the favorite during the past two periods , the taste now changed to colored marble . Heavy satins decorated with bees and stars were favorite fabrics . Empire is immediately recognizable from any other period of furniture . There is no niggardly adaptation of a swag here and some fluting there . It is out-spokenly , grandly itself . Whether you like it or not , it was a new start , made by a new society created in revolution , and inspired by a man who could bend his world to his own ideas . The following Restoration and Charles X styles , as that of Louis Phillipe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bourgeosie did ban the elegant woods after a time , and resorted to local oak , beech , olive , and boxwood . The fine cabinet makers were gone , and the guilds destroyed , so quality fell to a low level . Well , we have swept on past the ages of oak , which stopped roughly with Louis XIV in Europe , and have found  | ourselves well into the age of mahogany . Before going on with this and further periods , let 's review the basic styles in the European period of oak , which has , you recall , extended roughly from the 15th through the 17th centuries . In England , the Tudor , Elizabethean , Jacobean , and William and Mary styles show us the transition from the heaviness of late Gothic with its architectural-like pieces , to the more refined adaptations of the late Renaissance , employing an exchange of culture with Flemish , German , and Italian influences . Carving was deep and rather geometric in design , with little softness or curves present . It would fall into our category @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier refinements through a borrowing of highly developed ideas from Greek and Roman sources , and even from Egyptian craftsmen and ruins . Early pieces were heavy , ornately carved , and fussy in detail . They were massive in proportion because of the tremendously scaled rooms of the day . One can maintain a key to the Renaissance and Louis XIV styles by remembering the popular motifs of the day were the acanthus leaf , sunburst , bird , and mask carvings . The chairs of this period , both Louis XIII and XIV , had curved stretcher bars placed rather close to the floor . You will notice that Louis XV and XVI do not use them . With the birth of the English Empire , along came the Queen Anne and Georgian styles during the years 1702-1714 , and 1714-1811 respectively . Some believe this began the golden age of furniture styles , although no one is quite sure how the Queen Anne style evolved from the hodgepodge of Renaissance influence on Gothic and medieval forms . It might be called a fundamental style created by a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first growth of cities in Great Britain as England thrived on trade from its colonies . This produced a new merchant class that represented a fresh and monied market for the cabinet makers . These fellows soon stopped being traditional crafts- men and organized shops employing as many as a hundred men , rather than maintaining the small family shops of artisans . One made legs all day , one made arms , and so forth , and thus the factory idea came to furniture-making as well as to other trades . In other words , their product was far from being the furniture of the nobility . These consumers already had theirs . . . and serfs to make more when it wore out . This was furniture to cater to the popular taste of the newly rich merchant class . Queen Anne was the first really simplified , functional , and original design concept since the Middle Ages . . . and there were to be many copies , as we shall see . For the first time in England , the slender cabriole leg was used ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . Along with an overlapping with mahogany , here also began the English age of walnut , with some coming from Europe , and much of our own Virginian walnut shipped over . ( Some uncertainty exists about the exact date that walnut was first used , as a little was used in the Tudor period . However , as it was not the chief wood in fashion , we can say its popular use started about 1660 , and became the rage in the early 1700 's . ) Its advantage over oak , besides its finer grain , is its ease in carving , and the fact that it does n't shrink or swell as oak does . During the Georgian period , some of the simple grace of Queen Anne was lost . Pieces tended to become heavier and more squat . The splat ( center portion of a chair back rising from the seat to the top rail ) was not left plain as in Queen Anne , but was carved and later pierced with strapwork designs . Tallboys and chests of these periods were outstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top of another larger chest ; these setting on high , graceful legs . Gate-leg tables , inherited from the oak period , continued their popularity , with modifications due to the new timber and the sizes of homes . Occasional tables and multi-purpose tables were the new feature of the period .  | To sum up the Queen Anne style : suddenly here were gracefully sculptured pieces of wood , as opposed to the previously decorated posts and panels . With no decoration at all , the leg of a pure Queen Anne chair is a thing of beauty , and also a practical improvement over the straight leg , giving extra bracing at the top where it is needed , and extra wood at the bottom where the most wear occurs . The same gentle curves of the typical legs are then carried through the rest of the parts . . . still without frivolity , and at the first of their period , with little or no carvings . Of course , there were those who could n't resist the temptation to gussy things up , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as George I was now reigning . The age of mahogany now began , and would last until about 1760 . Many of these typical pieces were made by the first of the three Chippendales , Thomas I. It is a transitional style which was really used to financial advantage by the cabinet maker who gave his name to the beginning of the era of English cabinet-making that depended on Greek and Roman designs for its motif . His son , Thomas Chippendale II ( 1749-1779 ) , was the most famous of the three . In him , we see embodied the coincidental meeting of a man and his career opportunity . The man was , a master carver ; his opportunity was the demand for ornate furniture by the newly rich , just as mahogany was arriving in full force ready to be carved . The style and the wood were well-adapted to the large-scale living of the " gentleman " class . Early Chippendale furniture has been described as being rococo Queen Anne ( an ornate , Baroque feature designating a style whose most important design is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Here came the claw and ball foot , ribbon carving , and the intricate pierced carving . Added to the legs of a Queen Anne chair , these give an Oriental effect ; in backs they give a somewhat structural weakness . This lack of strength does not occur in the tables  | and chests of the period , but they are called over-decorated Queen Anne because of these motifs . Thomas II refined the style and added a variety of others , including Chinese , Rococo French , and Gothic . He was noted for his chairs , as well for his girandoles , mirror frames , and assorted beds ( canopy , Chinese , dome Gothic , field , and tent ) . He also designed many stands , side and serving tables . His son later designed furniture in the Regency style which followed . When we think of 18th century furnishings in the great mansions of our country , it is more often than not that of the Chippendale period . Overlapping the last two Chippendales and coinciding with them in their various times as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard of . They brought a refinement and grace to their pieces , as well as a smaller scale . With Robert Adam ( 1758-1792 ) and his brother , James , came the influence of Greek and Roman design nearly undiluted to English design . While Chippendale seemed to have tried many adaptations of exotic ideas , Adam unabashedly wanted his furniture to look like a Greek temple in miniature . His most typical detail is the fluted-column leg ; sometimes with a block foot that looks like the base of a Greek column . Other typical details are the draped garlands on the fronts of drawers , use of light wood inlays ( especially satinwood ) , and sometimes the use of paint in white . His pervasive method of work probably stemmed from his early career as an architect . As a matter of fact , he was the King 's architect when he turned to designing furniture . His contemporary , George Hepplewhite ( 1750-1790 ) , retained a basically Grecian look , but as a competitor he had to have something new , so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight-tapered leg ending in the spade foot or tipped in brass . His other most typical development was the shieldback chair , which was beautiful to look at , but delicate and rather uncomfortable . He also used a heart-shaped design in his chair backs , but his most  | practical and simple design was the arm chair and the so-called Martha Washington chair . He used wheat ears , fern leaves , honeysuckle , swags , and feather motifs . His work is characterized by lightness of construction , elegant curvilinear forms , and perfection or workmanship . His credo was to " unite elegance and utility , and blend the useful with the agreeable . " Following on his heels came Thomas Sheraton . With him , we see a melding , blending of the immediately preceding styles , plus the great influence of the Louis XVI design . You see , these masters of their craft were not above copying . . . any of them . He did , however , keep his types simple and classic , with that little touch of French for spice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but making them round and fluted , somewhat reminiscent of the Adam leg . He used satinwood veneers , straight lines , inlays rather than painted decorations , and he imparted an over-all elegance , grace , and refinement in his early and middle years . In his later and less known works he tried to introduce an aggravated version of the French Empire style , with urns , rosettes , festoons , scrolls , and pendant flowers as decorative motifs , which rather over-did his work . With these English cabinet makers , we must include Duncan Phyfe , for although he worked in America , it is hard to classify him as anything but an English cabinet maker . His work seemed to be a continuation of Sheraton 's , although he added to this the curved chair leg with a line similar to the Greek Ionic column , plus eagles and other Federal motifs . In his New York factory he employed up to a hundred men , and there copied all of his contemporaries plus the newly emerging French Empire style . Thus it is hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one could say he personified the American Regency period . His Federal pieces displayed good proportions , good lines , and a high quality of mahogany . Most typical of his motifs are the lyre and plume , the column supports with flaring  | legs on tables ( some with lyre pedestals ; some with acanthus leaf carving ) . He created the first mechanical card table with its movable support for the unfolding leaf which flipped over to double the size . It is best to digress somewhat again , in order to mention the introduction and the historical influences of furniture in the United States . From the arrival of the original Pilgrims in 1620 , down to the opening of the Revolutionary War in 1775 , most of the early settlers were British , isolated from their former circumstances by distance , climate , and requirements of the new life , such as survival , social , moral , intellectual , and economic factors . They are thrown on their own resources , and even if they had wanted to model their designs on English examples of furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each furniture maker had to rely on himself , his own sometimes crude tools , and half-forgotten patterns from the old country for the development of a design . His result was variation , individuality , and function . The chief periods and styles which they emulated consisted of three we have previously studied . The first was Jacobean , based on household pieces the Pilgrims brought over , but made from American oak , pine , and maple . Then evolved adaptations from William and Mary , which was better suited to their smaller homes than the heavier Jacobean . Queen Anne was also copied in its fundamental lines , but rather inferior in woods and workmanship . American designs of New England Colonial ( 1630-1725 ) had dignity , character , and purely functional design . It embodied the idea that if something was made from a purely practical point of view , it would be beautiful , utilizing the material and the design in the way which gained the most strength and function from it . This concept evolved into Colonial furniture , made through trial and error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all they could from the pine wood and crude tools of their time . Later , better tools and harder  | woods of cherry and maple were found or made , and incorporated into the work . The tavern table , the sawbuck table , the hutch cabinet , the settle chair , and the Windsor chair were some of those pieces built to do a good service to their users . We know of the beauty which shows in their lasting design and function as we see them yet today . Special attention is focused on the Windsor chairs as an important feature of Colonial design . They are so light in weight , simple in design , but the strongest in use of any furniture we know . Many already over two hundred years old are still in daily use , and perfect condition . They were made of various woods combined ; seats being poplar or pine ; spokes and curved backs of springy ash and hickory , and the legs of hard rock maple . No glue was used . They were fitted together with wgoden wedges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came through the arms or curved back sections . Sometimes the ends of the spindles that fit into the seat were carved to a small ball . This was naturally called a ballsocket joint , and the result of using it was that even when one of these chairs has dried out , it may rattle when it is shaken , but it will never come apart . Windsor chairs were most always painted green , red , black , yellow , or white . Do you think that Danish Modern is the last word in modern design ? Better take a look at the Shaker period ( 1760-1800 ) . Here is a case of an isolated society which produced something totally new and different . They believed in absolutely no frills , and in their efforts toward simplicity and function , came up with many designs we call " Contemporary " today . This furniture was designed in the community 's own shops for their own communal use only , because of their religious belief in seclusion . It looks twentieth-century modern . Really , there is nothing new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America began to furnish their homes in a manner reflecting their pride in their new and growing nation . As a result , the words , " Federal  | Period , " refer to the furniture and decorative pieces that were made during the years when the United States government was being established . The eagle dominant in the Great Seal , adopted by Congress in 1782 , was carved in wood , etched in glass , painted on pottery , and stitched into needlework . It was the most popular decorative motif of the Federal years . This period , with its many quality pieces of furniture and accessories , was actually a remake of Hepplewhite , Sheraton , and Phyfe . Most notable was the convex mirror framed in gold leaf , bearing the eagle at the top and having a pendent finial of foliage . Many have thirteen buttons or knobs placed equidistant around the frame , designating the thirteen states . Brass fireplace fixtures on the hearths of most homes , floor clocks , and great breakfronts were much in evidence . It was a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; all having a bearing on the styles of the time . In the years before the arrival of Victorian furniture , many American factories sprang up to manufacture what were called " fancy chairs " by the thousands . Lambert Hitchcock was the first real mass-producer of furniture in this country , and is still in production . We recognize Boston rockers of this period , as well as the lovely spool furniture . This was invented by some enterprising brain in a spool factory . He looked at the long wooden poles which turned into many consecutive spools ( to be later cut apart and used for thread ) , and saw the possibilities for furniture . As these turnings were made of whatever wood was handy , it had to be painted and decorated for the sake of unity . When we see " spoolings " on our Early American pieces , it is interesting to know that some of the originals were turned out on a lathe in the corner of grist mills . . . the first power tool in the country . This American Fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rugged individualism , the inspirations of our New England and Southern highland forebears . They and their reproduc- tions possess a decorative personality that will stand out with special charm when combined with other periods . Although often of cherry , they harmoniously complement pieces of mahogany , walnut , or maple . Furniture of the Victorian era to follow was as sturdy as the virtues of those who made and bought it both in America and England ; for it is as much of America as it was of England , in spite of its being named for the enduring Queen during her rule of the mother country . It has its devotees who love its gaudily ornate style and feel that it reflects the diverse vigorous individuality and experimentation characteristic of nineteenth-century America . There are those detractors who call it a " goulash " of everything that had been made before in furniture history , plus the influence of the Germanic ancestry of the Queen and Prince Consort . Both are partially right , and because of its popularity in any case , it is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish influence on American furniture design today is so tremendous , we should know a bit of the cultural history of Spain . Through many invasive pressures on the country , it has learned and adapted from other lands the nuances of design we have for so long attributed to Spain itself . Much of the old designs of architecture and furniture equated bulk with grandeur . It had an occasional elegance , along with an unnatural sedateness ; probably because of their innate sense of defeatism , melodrama , and preoccupation with death , due to the influence of their early history . A typical architecture will combine Roman columns , capitals , and pediments holding up Arabic arches . Arabic mosaics and wood paneling surround Spanish baroque inscriptions , Moorish tiles are everywhere . . . yet these elements have perfect coherence in their usage . The eternal Spanish battle with intense sun and heavy shadows has influenced the deep carvings and textural fabrics . This gives their design an interplay of airy lightness and deep shadows , resulting in dramatic overtones.  | There is so much similarity between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and England , that they are difficult to tell apart . For this reason , of course , they are very compatible used together . Mexico was a colony of Spain , just as we were a colony of England , and their adaptations of the mother country 's designs in furniture were modified to their own usage just as our was . Most of it was scaled down to fit more modest surroundings . This refinement of Spanish design by Mexican colonists resulted in superior modern pieces , partly because the light-hearted Mexican approach to everything has lightened the more somber Spanish feeling of old . Spanish-Mexican influence has resulted in magnificent furniture sturdy enough for the most virile man and yet so beautifully proportioned that women love it , too . It fits into many backgrounds with charming ease . It can dress up provincial architecture , has the required dignity for Traditional , and its mellowness lends character to otherwise stark Contemporary . . . depending on its modifications in reproduction . The far Western , and particularly Californian heritage reflects the true charm of Spain , Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region 's informal living embodies the carefree attitudes of festive Spain , enhanced by their Mexican descendants . . . so it is only natural that this part of the country will particularly favor this style . Did you ever consider how our architectural and furniture styles have been influenced by the economic system of our country , and why styles were adapted in the locations where they were first built ? For instance , there are several distinct forms of the Colonial we call Early American . Dutch Colonial was Holland-inspired , and showed the tastes and practices of long-established civilization modified by the compulsion of new conditions and local necessity . These homes were built thriftily with the stone and wood which were plentiful . They developed the overhanging eave , often sheltering a lean-to across the rear  | of the house , and the neat grouping of buildings for increased usage during the long winters . They used no excess ornamentation other than the small designs cut into their shutters , and the distinctive bell-shaped roof . The shutters were used for additional insulation against the cold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time was not durable here in the cold season . The New England style called Cape Cod also usually had an unbroken northern slope well-suited to the cold New England climate . Its central fireplace helped support the structure from strong winds , and the pine paneling on the walls was livened by gay colors in fabrics . The exterior , like the furniture , was sturdy and functional like that of the Dutch neighbors , and had a charm characteristic of honest design . In Pennsylvania , New Jersey , and Delaware , the German influence on homes and furnishings was very strongly felt . The over-hanging eave was used in barns and houses alike to shelter stock and humans . Their durable designs solved a need in a most direct and uncompromising way . The modern-minded need not feel they have invented functionalism . Here it was the by-word . Changes in our economic system in the late 18th century modified our country 's house plans along with its furniture , as did the influx of population from Europe . When labor was cheap , many dormer windows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were featured . During this era , servants could be had for low wages and long hours , so no plan for convenience or compactness was considered . Rather , the typical style was ornate ; mansions were large with long hallways and oversized rooms . Many rooms were added for show rather than utility . During these days of our young country , the interiors of the homes were influenced by the popular cabinet makers of the day , and the decor was gracious and rich . Its requirements had a specific objective . . . the aura of the " cultured gentleman . " Home designs were transplanted directly from England ,  | preserving exact likenesses , with richly ornamented doorways , porticoes , and an ordered array of line , surface , mass , and space . Take a drive around your own city , and notice the details of any old homes still standing . They conjure up thoughts of wonder about the names and nationalities of the architects . . . what influenced their particular design . . . how a veritable history of our country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In some , we note the beginnings of a conservative trend of the American builder , but feel originality in the choice of details was not the aim . Rather , a young nation 's unsureness is reflected by the great dominance of European design . In a community founded by people from France , a predominance of Norman-type towers is noted . Lovely details from the Italian Renaissance furnished inspiration on roofs and porches on others . The formal Georgian style , still considered to be the perfect form , was used on many . These two-storied mansions are as lovely today as when new , with their distinguished exteriors of perfect proportions , refinement , and contrast of plain areas with conservative detail in window treatment , doors , and pillars . The same style is modified and condensed into smaller cottages of great charm . Here and there on other streets , you will find a touch of English Victorian , Gothic , Napoleonic Renaissance , and other marvelous inspirations from antiquity , including the presently popular Spanish or Mediterranean mode . Young designers in a young Republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many towns in the United States have a good selection by apparently good architects for discerning citizens . What a shame they can not be preserved , renovated , and cherished along with our care and love for antique furniture ! Whether you believe it fun and interesting to trace these architectural histories or not . . . you should , at any rate ,  | become aware of their differences . The exterior and interior of a home should have some compatibility in design and function . Our history of furniture , to be complete , should include some information about the woods , lamps , fabrics , and classic decorative motifs of the past . . . for they , too are part of the mosaic of history , as well as a part of our furnishing scene . Have you ever considered that one of earth 's most dependable bounties . . . other than food . . . is wood ? Man has depended on wood for fuel , dwellings , ships , vehicles , and many other employments in daily life . Not the least of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times of earliest tools it has been so . Because hardwoods are used almost exclusively in furniture , we shall review a few interesting facts about them . There are about 99,000 species of hardwoods known to botanists , of which only about 250 are available for commercial use . Only about 50 hardwoods are used extensively for furniture , and the most popular of these are oak , maple , birch , cherry , red mahogany , walnut , teak , ebony , rosewood , prima vera ( a white mahogany ) , myrtlewood , and Carpathian elm . It is thought that Columbus first found and brought pieces of mahogany to his King and Queen , but it was n't appreciatively used until much later . Queen Victoria favored rosewood , probably because she was involved in the economic development of India where it grew . Now most of this comes from Brazil , because its darker color and richer veinings are more popular . Chippendale , as we have already noted , made mahogany fashionable back in the 18th century . Its strength and grain is well-suited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maroon finish provided the rich luster his clients wanted . Presently , the wish is for a browner stain , but it is still a very beautiful and enduring wood in either tone . Walnut has had its ups and downs from Colonial times  | to the present , and at one time , it , like cherry , was so wantonly destroyed that only recent conservation practices have restored it in any quantity for our uses . Now these two beautiful woods are used in their full glory , and their finishing is so handsome as to deserve their continuing popularity . Cherry wood comes from the wild cherry tree , not those grown for edible fruit , and incidentally , is the only true fruitwood used in the American furniture industry . Napoleon preferred the dark richness of ebony , possibly as a foil for his ostentatious clothing and furnishings . Only recently has another exotic wood been in popular use for furniture . That is teak , which used to be used only for ship decks and floors in any place except the Orient . The history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A sort of romantic necessity of life , would n't you say ? The history of fabrics is another exciting tale , with the influences of each succeeding era developing them along with the magnificent march of Time . We sha n't concern ourselves now with the mundane fabrics of necessity , but rather with those of decorative and art forms . There is a legend that French tapestry weaving in Aubusson started in 711 A.D. , having been brought by the conquering Saracens ; but the oldest existing tapestries date from the 14th century . These Gothic pieces , although of rudimentary techniques , are astonishingly handsome in their use of few colors , absence of perspective and tonal shadings , and the use of wool adding texture and surface interest . Their theme , inspired by their usage in cathedrals , had deep spiritual overtones . In 1514 , Raphael did a series of designs for tapestries for the looms in Brussels , applying his own painting techniques to this new art form , and thereby innovating a sensational new process of incorporating light , air , and perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " decorator , " Charles le  | Brun , to consolidate the Gobelin and Beauvais tapestry works for the glory of France , giving him the best painters in the kingdom , and eighty weavers . They reproduced magnificent paintings on their tapestries , by " painting " with their bobbins in silks and wools , and this continued on through the next kingly reign or two to give us gorgeous tapestries which are still hanging today . There are contemporary artists in France today who design for tapestries of great value . The art of weaving is left in the hands of master craftsmen , who do nothing else . Apprentice weavers spend years in school , working under masters of , perhaps , forty years of experience . The artist knows weaving techniques a11d use of material , but does not do the active weaving after he draws the " cartoon . " The weaver closely follows the full-scale design of the artist , changing nothing , and following the color swatches and materials exactly as shown him . Average production is one square yard per month per weaver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still regal . Did you know that Louis Pasteur of anti-rabies fame , was the first to start research on silkworm blight , which led to the making of man-made fabrics ? A half-century ago , America had only four fibers , all natural , for their textile needs . These were cotton , silk , wool , and linen . Today we may select fabrics from more than twenty fibers , sixteen of which are products of the laboratory . . . the results of research by such scientists as Pasteur . . . and the list grows longer each year . The origin of classic decorative motifs through the ages has nearly always stemmed from nature . . . and the legends surrounding its beginning are as charming as the designs themselves . One of the many inspirations of well-known motifs is the acanthus leaf . About 2000 years ago a workman saw a struggling acanthus which had forced its way through a hole in an abandoned basket ; its leaves bent back in its  | progress to form a curiously beautiful design . He sketched it into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , friezes on temples , churches , and homes . The same basic design was used much later in Baroque carvings of the 17th century . The long golden tassels of the winter-flowering quince bush were the direct inspiration for the Adam brothers ' most exquisite designs of the 18th century . These are found in swags and festoons above mirrors , down the plinths of chests , and even on the front of modern-day television sets . Among the most famous motifs is the fleur-de-lis of France . When you see it charmingly repeated on brocades , wall papers , and furniture moldings , you are looking at several centuries of French history . . . and at a misnomer . The symbol is really an iris , not a lily . It was probably called " Fleur de Louis " during the crusades of the 12th century , when it was emblazoned on the shields of Louis XII . After him , it became fleur-de-luce , and finally fleurde-lis , after many mistaken pronunciations through the years . Another important design used over the centuries and throughout our present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek mythology and on ancient Persian tiles , it somehow was decided as early as the 13th century that the rose had British blood in its veins . It has been used ever since in various forms as a heraldic symbol of British royalty . The rose of Edward I was golden , that of Henry IV was red , and Edward IV had white ; but the most famous as a decorative concept is the Tudor Rose . It is used in carvings in churches , on cabinetry , fabrics , and dishes , ancient and modern , naturalized and abstracted . The rose is revered in literature from Shakespeare to Gertrude Stein , and what Victorian carpet could be worthy of the name unless it was lavished with them ?  | Down to the present day , nature has been the continuing inspiration of decorative design . . . for although the modernist school of art shuns the naturalistic in art forms , the people still love the beautiful sources of decorative inspiration around them . Skipping from the purely decorative to the purely functional , at least in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without light throughout the ages man could not see the surroundings he had made for himself past the daylight hours . Approximately 15,000 years before Christ , the first lamps of which we have any record , were used by Stone Age man . These were six inches in length , the shape of a shell-like bowl , and of a pottery-type material . Sometimes they were engraved on the bottom with clearly defined animal figures ( some of these were excavated in Monrovia ) . Dried moss formed wicks , with animal fat for fuel . Our own Eskimos used similar ones . In Hawaii , early lamp fuel was made from candlenuts crushed for their oil , and bark cloth ( tapa ) was used for the wick . Pottery lamps were used by many cultures , shaped to suit their concepts of life ; therefore combining art , religion , and utility . For example , lamps made by Egyptian Coptic Christians symbolized the resurrection . From the Island of Rhodes , crusader lamps of Maltese cross design were prominent . Rome used many fish forms with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to be sure , gave off more smoke than light . Lighting was very dim and inadequate - yet in the 17th and 18th centuries , although lamps did become more functional around that time . Wax candles cost so dearly that only the very rich could afford them . Others had to make do with evil-smelling tallow , which had been used for centuries . Italian titled families had palace lamps of ornately designed brass . One example featured two spouts for flames ;  | with a shade , flame snuffer , wick pick and trimmer ; all combined in an artistic arrangement of brass with the family crest on the side of the oil tank . Some museums have lamps from Algeria used for marriage ceremonies ; 19th century Jewish dedication lamps ; Javanese temple lamps of 1650 A.D. ; ritualistic lamps used by Balinese priests ; ornately-decorated tiny Nepalese pieces from the 17th century ; and temple lamps of Hindu origin , among the more prosaic examples of past cultures . As with most reviews of history , these examples show us how far we have progressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Have you ever considered the importance and excitement of something so prosaic as a nail ? They , too , have an interesting history . It is often thought that nails were not used on antique furniture ; but actually some form of nail was used first functionally , then decoratively in the Middle Ages . They became larger and more ornate , and then a sort of repetitive embellishment . This decorative use of nails was introduced in Spain , Portugal , and Italy in the Gothic period and then used in England and France in the 17th century . They have been used from early times in our country , and are found on many of the earliest pieces . Before 1790 , nails were made only by hand , and hence a test for examining antiques for age will determine whether a piece was made prior to that date based on the type of nails . These early nails were of iron and were strong and durable ( although easily bent and quick to rust ) . Being hand wrought , no two were ever exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mount and frame them for a grand wall piece ! ) Nails were expensive , therefore , because of the tedious procedure involved in making them . Metal plates had to be cut into small thin rods , then heated in a forge and hammered into shape on an anvil . The heads were then shaped in a vise , and these were either flat or rounded and show- ing the marks of the hammer . Most nail bodies were square , although I 've seen a few primitive ones which were more or less rounded . Names like Flat Point Rose and Rose Sharp sound like elegant silverware or fine china designs , do n't they ? Actually , they 're the names of some of the decorative 18th century nails . Ornamental nails with large round heads are seen on the upholstery of various chairs and sofas of the period . These were used with even greater frequency after 1790 , when machines could make them for about onethird the price . Today , modern machines turn out nails at the rate of 10 to 1,000 a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have hundreds of them in many different lengths and head designs appropriate for every use . . . and although they are stronger , uniform of size and shape , they are still exciting when one looks at them and imagines what of many purposes they can be serving in their useful lifetime . Doors , too , have an interesting history of design . When we know the meaning behind their styling , modern adaptations take on more meaning along with their preservativetreatment for longer life , and precision in easy-to-use stock sizes . Using the proper motif gives a dramatic custom look to both exterior and interior doors . A change of doors to one of these designs is an easy way to improve a plain or uninteresting home , and give it a more fashionable look . Some of these charming and still high-fashion designs include , among the Colonial stylings : The six-panel , or Cross and Bible , door . The upper four panels form a cross , and the two lower panels represent the open pages of a bible . These are of solid wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top wood panels . The eight-panel door has two groupings of panels , each representing a cross . There is a panel door with fan lights . This has an insert of glass on top that represents an open fan .  | Another panel door has cathedral lights . In this , shaped lights set in the top of the door look like church windows , after the Gothic fashion . The Dutch door consists of two independently operating halves , the top half being either wood panels or having glass lights ; the bottom half can have one of several designs . Different effects are achieved by combining a wide variety of styles . It is said that this practical door came about through the necessity of letting in light and air while keeping out the livestock which was usually close by on the Dutch family farms . European styles have a reflection of the Tudor tradition , with fifteen panels of either glass or wood . There is the Florentine door with its eight-panels representing a series of arches supported by intersecting columns . Mediterranean and Spanish style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open grillwork panels in a number of motifs , including the Moorish openwork . This chapter has taken the reader on a fast tour through nearly five hundred years of Western furnishings . To condense this history into a certain number of pages and still comment on important features was a difficult task . Several interesting , but less important adjacent periods had to be omitted . Since I could n't detail the history of all of them , I have concentrated only on those more widely recognized in our daily contacts . On your next shopping trip , take a look at some of our reproductions . . . go out and examine the originals in museums . You 'll find graceful furniture with a timeless quality of design and rugged appearance ( in all but a few ) , that will take the onslaught of growing families while beautifying your home . At any rate , you 'll enjoy noticing modern adaptations ; and by your knowledge of a little of the history of furniture , you will be helped in the choice of furnishings for your home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard ) Arabesque ?

You 've admired furniture pieces in museums and home shows and in window displays . You have definite likes and dislikes for what you have seen . . . but can you place what you like in a room setting as a result of your own self-expression ? Viewing furniture in these well-decorated and designed public settings is great for stimulating ideas , but there are few of them which one will want to copy literally . Rather , there should be an adaptation of ideas which you have gathered up for use in your own setting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the various regions of the United States vary from place to place , as well as from family to family . Although each section will have some individual devotees of every style ; each region will have a dominant habit of design indigenous to that area . For instance , the main emphasis is on Colonial in New England , and Contemporary in the Southwest . In the Far West , Oriental is prevalent , especially around San Francisco . Mediterranean is very popular throughout the country , but an enduring part of the " Early California " mood favored by Westeners . On the east coast , a more traditional , formal style with a European influence is used . Windows are smaller , as needed for privacy and heat control , and are more elaborately dressed . Architectural interest is employed in rooms seeking more centers of interest within themselves . . . these rooms are often filled with furnishings which often fall just short of the cluttered look .  | In the West , emphasis is on architectural texture and design , and wide-open vistas through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a need , therefore , for open spaces within rooms and room arrangements to care for this necessary indoor-outdoor circulation . The patio is considered as a necessary additional room adjunct in many areas , and much function is oriented to its convenient access . Bright , bold colors started in California and the Southwest , but are now replacing some of the subdued , understated colors in the East , where soft , neutralized colors have long been de rigueur . In the South , the traditional ante-bellum opulence is still prominent . The foreign influence here is still mainly English with Colonial overtones . Awnings inside and out , shutters , canopies , and elaborate window coverings are used in keeping with the architectural design . The Midwest uses a lot of traditional , but with more dramatic use of bright colors than farther east , and favoring a little less formality . Modern is preferred by many homeowners throughout the country for its clean , uncluttered lines and the spacious feeling it can give to a small home or apartment . The Scandinavian styling introduced a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many pieces can be used later in combination with other periods if your preference changes . Most interior designers add a Contemporary piece , anyway , to their traditional decors ( and vice versa ) for a change of pace . This idea added to a Contemporary room , may be a Bentwood rocker , an old campaign chest , one of several types of Oriental tables , desks , screens , or a Spanish chest . Their simplicity of line lends them to the scale of a Contemporary room and makes it possible to use rich color hues in the fabrics . These fabric designs are therefore also changing from delicate scale to bolder , more colorful florals , stripes , geometric designs , and the like . Modern is most popular with young couples ; perhaps because of the gay and unusual things one can do around it .  | With the jet age and shifting population carrying regional ideas back and forth , each area melds more closely into the patterns of the other . Only varied climatic conditions and privacy needs bring a necessary modification to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decorating a home today can be a very personal expression of the tastes , interests , heritage , and way of life of a family . Wherever you live , you have sources for furniture of every style and period , faithfully reproduced or modified to a more eclectic look ; but in any case , scaled suitably for your home and pocketbook . Available also , are the accessories , lighting fixtures , clocks , mirrors , hardware , carpeting , paneling , floor coverings , and fabrics which are suitable for use with them . All one needs to know is how to choose . . . that makes the difference between poor and inspired decorating . The best beginning is to start with a style you know and like . If you are not sure what you like and why , it will take a little study and search to determine this . You need to know something about the background of the period , if you choose a period style , plus the furniture , fabrics , and accessories customarily used with it . Even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this knowledge will help you to judge both good antiques and their reproductions , and train your eye to distinguish between good and bad design in furnishings both old and new . This type of research is a good way to develop your taste . A love of beauty will be a great help , plus an eye for color , a love of comfort , and a care for the well-being of your family . Attractive rooms just do n't " happen . " Whether the product of trained knowledge or natural good taste , such rooms are the result of furnishings which have character , harmonious color , and correct scale . It is no secret that buying furniture is a major event . . . the after-effects of which continue to live with one for years to come . Unlike the purchase of a new car or wardrobe , this is not a temporary matter , but something permanent . Fine furnishings are built to last  | for many years , and therefore , are deserving of more than ordinary consideration if you are to fully enjoy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion , picking up pieces when you run into them at sales without a definite plan . Needless to say , then , the furniture you select should not only be fitting for the architecture and climatic conditions of your house , but complementary to the lives of you and your family , and contingent on your budget . We have been talking so much about periods in furniture , our attitude must n't seem dogmatic about the subject of " period styles . " We do n't want to place too much emphasis upon furniture styles and confuse you as to " which goes with what . " We have just read and considered the many exciting historical periods , designs , and styles , in order to gain the inspiration to decorate our homes in a different mode ; but this does not mean , of course , that every room must be of the same period , or that it all must be of the exact period of the external architecture . A blending of styles is very desirable , but it can all meld into a goulash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome and distinctive decor you had hoped for , without a bit of " know-how " so you can plan with care . First of all , what is style ? It is the characteristics of a design . It is the personal element that distinguishes one period or designer 's work from another 's , and gives expression through line and form to individuality . It may be bad or good ; it may be old or new ; it may be lively or dull ; it may be elegantly formal or warm and casual ; and its acceptance is often dominated by the " mass " rather than the " class " of an era . Actually , there are two different kinds of style . . . true style and passing trends ( call it fancies , frills , or fads , if you will ) . True style has the deep impact of a truly creative designer , while fads are whimsical and transitory . The former changes lines , form , and sizes of the mode , while the latter is concerned primarily with surface ornamentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , for it marks an entire epoch . In order that you achieve a lasting satisfaction in your choice , you must make a wise selection from the many of both offered you . How does one do this ? Whether your taste and circumstances dictate simple comfort , formal elegance , or gay sophistication , the architecture of your house and its furnishings should be in harmony to such an extent as is reasonably possible . For example , do n't purchase elaborate French furniture for a Cape Cod cottage . There is an ample choice of delightful New England pieces in just the right character . However , a blending of styles is very desirable . For instance , if you have a house of simple Georgian or Colonial character , you can create pleasant contrast by using French Provincial in some of the rooms . Certain Early English pieces are ambient with the Cape Cod , providing they are those of the simplified country style . Naturally , it is wise to choose styles from the same general epoch . It is seldom possible to get satisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Georgian period of late 18th century . Or take the current feeling for Mediterranean . It 's a theme composed of various southern European backgrounds . . . Spanish , Portuguese , Italian , and French , with a dash of Mexican ( Spanish Colonial ) , and a goodly helping of English tossed in . It is really a mood , not a definite style . It can be picturesque and informal , with sunkissed colors and rough-hewn surfaces , with more than a touch of Moorish design . It can be elegant and formal , with overtones of Louis XV and Queen Anne . During the reign of Spain 's Philippe V , Queen Anne was reigning in England , with a vigorous influence upon the trend of furniture lines throughout Europe . Each country modified the scale , proportions , and colorations to their own tastes , but with the outstanding lines still clearly identifiable and therefore interchangeable in our home today with pieces of like relationship . It is much safer to confine yourselves to related styles .  | However , it is the scale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to worry too much about whether it was designed by Mr. Chippendale or by Thomas Sheraton . Certainly , you do not want your selections to be stereotyped in any event , so a good mixture of occasional pieces lend themselves particularly well to leavening an otherwise ordinary room . The grace of Sheraton is so ambient with Italian Court ; the distinctive Chinese Chippendale is " made " for Oriental Modern ; while the more rococo Chippendale blends with Louis XIV . Danish Modern is nearly identical to American Shaker primitives or to the austere Mexican Colonial pieces . The list goes on and on , with the same adaptations and blending being possible with many other periods , as long as one remembers to mix " fine with fine , " and " coarse with coarse " . . . or if you 'd rather , formal with formal , informal with informal , rustic with other primitive motifs . Do n't be afraid to innovate within the scope of what is possible and practical . Along with our esthetic desires in furniture selection , it is advisable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the furnishings themselves and to their relation to the house in which they are to be used . The majority of us must plan to purchase furniture over a period of time and budget its acquisition closely in order to have what we want . It is only sensible , then , to consider far in advance how much can and should be spent on furnishings . A longstanding rule of thumb is to provide about twenty-five percent of the value of the house for an over-all furnishing budget . This has been established as an average amount of total evaluation . Each room should be considered according to its relative importance in the home activities , and naturally this will vary with a family 's needs and desires . For the sake of simplicity in a sample figuring , let us take an average-priced house ( this figure will certainly vary from one part of the country to another , so our example  | will be based on Western California averages , which are admittedly higher than in many parts of the country . ) We shall consider a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our figuring of furnishings , since it 's largely built in ) at a cost of $16,000 . This gives us six rooms , if we have to furnish the kitchen with appliances . If part or all of these are built in , as they often are nowadays , this cost can be reapportioned to other furnishings , such as carpet in the bedrooms . If the house has a family room with dining area instead of the separate dining room , this also would be adjusted accordingly . This chart breaks down the average percentage of costs allowed for furnishing each room , and we base the totals on the 25 percent of our total house cost , which will be $4,000 : Before we itemize the proposed expenditures room by room , we must devise a system for the evaluation of furniture pieces . Each piece is relatively evaluated according to its comparable use and size in the room. * For example , we usually consider a sofa as having a unit value of 3 , a lounge chair 1 unit , and end table 112 unit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnishings we believe a family will need ; establish their apparent room value , and figure the amount we may reasonably spend on each . You may work out your own list with these as guidelines . Let 's start with the living room : ( 40% of budget ; estimated need 12 ? units. )  | These amounts are within reason for a house of this value at current prices of good quality furnishings . One should figure each room in the same way , using the unit system , and basing the total units on the needs of each room . For instance , a total of 7 units would be average for a bedroom , with 2 ? units for the bed , mattress , and box springs ; 21/ units for the dresser ; 314 unit for draperies ; lh unit each for 2 night tables ; and 1/4 unit each for 2 lamps . Divide the $600.00 designated for the master bedroom budget by the 7 ( units ) , and you will get the suggested cost per unit . Multiply the unit cost by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be within a few cents of $600.00 . If carpeting is very important to the family at the outset , there would be an automatic lowering of all unit costs in order to work that cost in . As you can see , it would be difficult to do this without seriously cutting the quality of either the furniture or the carpeting , so it is not recommended .  | The value of such a budget plan keeps the furnishings and house within a logical relationship . It will prevent putting more money than is necessary into one or two pieces of furniture and then having to skimp on the rest . It allows the purchase of permanent pieces of furniture at any convenient time ( few budgets can stand the total outlay at one time ) , but establishes the approximate amount that may be spent on the other pieces whenever one is ready to add them . Temporary pieces of furniture such as good used ones may cost much less and will be replaced as time and income allow . You will notice that varying budgets and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection of furniture at various prices . This means there is a probability that we shall also have a variance of quality along with price ; and we must give special thought to the matter of quality . Certain things might be taken for granted in all supposedly good furniture , as for instance , sound cabinet work and fine materials . Since these are essential to substantial construction you must look not only for them , but beyond them , if you care for things of permanent value and want to have lasting pleasure from them . How do you judge ? Upon observation of two pieces of furniture of comparable design , but of an apparent difference in price , it is often impossible to ascertain where the difference lies between the two pieces . This is because much of the quality of furniture lies beneath the covering as well as in the covering itself , in both the surface as well as hidden construction within . Let 's think about some of the requirements of wellconstructed pieces , because there are often vast differences not apparent to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our outlay of money . Among the dictionary definitions of the world " value , " are the two words " worth " and " desirability , " and it might be argued that the worth of an article or a commodity lies only in its desirability . One often hears such a phrase as , " I did n't really want it , but it was so cheap that I could n't  | resist it . In these circumstances , nothing is cheap , even if the actual price paid for it was very small . Conversely , a relatively worthless article may be so tricked out into desirability , that no matter what the price , it will find a purchaser , because its instrinsic worthlessness is hidden in shine and glitter . This is nowhere more true than in furniture , so we must look deeper for value . To a large extent you must rely upon the reputation of the maker of a piece and of the store where it is displayed . The quality which determines permanent value includes a fineness of design execution and patina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the main requirements when the question of choice is involved is the usefulness of the item to you . It is unwise to fill your space with something unless it adds esthetically to the room or serves a specific , useful purpose . Usefulness will not be adequate unless its finish can be easily cared for and will stand up under the wear expected of it . Each type of furnishing and each maker of that type varies in finish and finishing , and each must be treated carefully and correctly accordingly . It is wise to question the sales person about the proper care of a new piece before buying it . In the case of antiques , or reproductions using the traditional finishes , these must be also understood in order to preserve their original beauty . Many good manufacturers will enclose information about treatment of finishes , along with their label designating the type of finish and wood used . One misleading terminology the uninformed buyer should be on the watch for is on the sales tag denoting wood or finish . Some will say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can imply only that a mahogany finish has been applied to some other kind of wood , such as alder or beech ( woods much softer and less expensive ) . If it says " solid mahogany " or " mahogany veneer , " it has to mean just what it says , by Federal Trade Commission standards , and actual mahogany or veneer must have been used in the construction of all exposed parts of the furniture so labeled . This type of label- ing can designate the difference of cost between comparable-looking pieces . These labels are not too informative , but are perfectly legal , and the burden is upon the shopper to distinguish the difference . Learn more about the differences in woods so that you can more readily determine quality . Bear in mind that furniture is made of wood , and therefore has inconsistencies of color and grain in its inherent nature . There are no two pieces of wood alike ( nor two pieces of marble for that matter ) , so if you like a solid wood top , you must expect each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varying with the individual boards which are splined and glued together before finishing . This method of manufacturing a table top of solid wood is widely used instead of a slab type of construction because it will warp less and often takes a better polish . Veneer is a term of uncertain quality to the uninformed , and perhaps rightly so , for there are bad veneers as well as those excellent enough to be considered in the same class of quality as solid woods . Again , its worth is determined by its maker . In a good veneer , the first step is the lamination of the " core " . . . that is , building a " solid " piece of wood by joining seasoned layers in upright position under such pressure and with such permanence that it can never warp , crack , shrink , or expand . Wood must be kiln dried to the proper moisture content . The glue used must be waterproof and the glue bond used in joining the sections actually stronger than the wood . This laminated core is usually strengthened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardwood with the wood grain running in the opposite direction from that of the core wood . The top layer is beautifully grained hardwood . Where swirl or crotch mahogany is used , the face is usually backed by another piece of hardwood and the two joined under more heat and pressure with the waterproof glue , so as to prevent checking or cracking of the highly figured wood . Ve- neers enhance many fine pieces of furniture today , making them even lovelier than is possible with the limitations of a solid piece of wood , for a more uniform pattern can be had in the veneer process of peeling a log around its circumference . Because , also , many more layers of beautiful grains can be taken from our increasingly limited supplies of hardwoods , costs are less . We think of veneer as a modern technique . . . only the newer and better glues are different . Inlaid caskets of the Pharoahs : the great banquet tables of the Caesars , cabinets for Bourbon kings , the field desk of Napoleon , George Washington 's desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was available only to the famous and the wealthy . In your further search for quality , examine surface joints and mitred corners . These should be smooth and tight . Remember that an opaque finish can hide many defects and uneven cuts . That does not mean an opaque finish is necessarily faulty in itself . There are fine ones on the market . When you buy a piece with a clear finish , you should expect smooth workmanship , and it is easier . to judge quality on these . At least , quality , good or bad , is easily seen on them . No putty filling of the corners or excess glue left around the joints is acceptable . These will discolor any finish that is applied over them , and may eventually dry and crack . Look within the drawers to check the care with which they have been made . Are the joints smoothly dovetailed ? Or are they only nailed and glued ? Are the joints doweled or pegged ? This is the ultimate of strength and beauty ; although the speedier and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear , especially if used in combination with other joints such as the butt and mitre . The fragile mitre joints on narrow curved pieces , such as mirrors , are made exceedingly strong by the use of hardwood dowels , and , therefore , will not separate . Check the solidity of leg joints and the over-all weight of the piece . The frame or " skeleton " offers the real test of good , solid  | chests , desks , and bureaus , yet it is seldom examined by the casual purchaser . Here one notes how the different sections are joined . Pegging is important , as is the mortise and tenon . Beware of nailed or even screwed posts and rails . Do the drawers open and close smoothly and evenly ? Are they smoothly finished within ? Is there a dust panel between drawers ? What quality of wood is used for these interior surfaces ? Some thinly made drawers and dust panels will warp exceedingly . Finishes also vary widely in quality within the opaque and clear types we mentioned earlier . The usual commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spray and then rubbed . This quicker method is widely used and can be lovely . Only the most expensive piece nowadays are completely hand-applied , and of course they are superlative The few craftsmen still doing this apply the finish ( oil , shellac , varnish , or lacquer ) and color much as a painter works with palefte and canvas , working it into the wood with a small pad and the skill derived only from long training . He must have the ability of developing the soft , glowing effect called patine , which is the most difficult of all finishes to simulate . Even in the less expensive pieces which most of us have to buy , there are signs of differing quality . . . smoothness of surface , clearness of finish , and resistance to heat , moisture , and daily use . The commercial hand finishes , because they , much like the traditional ones , become a part of the wood itself , resist chipping and crazing . They can usually be identified by their clear but low-lustre ( satin ) look . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will chip and craze much more easily . Bar finish in modern terminology denotes the use of a surface lacquer . We are not speaking of the old linseed oil method of rubbing down a surface with many succeeding coats of the oil only , as was done originally on the ancient bars in a pub . This method gives a murky look to the wood , albeit  | a waterproof surface that is only enhanced by each dent given its sturdy surface . Many oil finishes by modern high-speed processes , other than the oil polymer technique , are suspect in my personal experience . Found on new pieces of walnut or teak , they are handsome . However , there is a limitation to their durability , no matter what they cost . Some will sun-fade , or stain with water from sweating vases , alcohol , or fruit acids . This has been overcome with the use of the synthetic , lowlustre oil polymer finish , but although it is a lovely finish in its own right , it does not exactly duplicate the original , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clear knowledge and understanding of the type of oil finish you are thinking of buying , along with a guarantee of what can be expected of it . The really old , slow method of applying an oil finish is something else again . Boiled linseed oil must be used ( we were speaking of raw linseed oil on the bar finish ) . To oversimplify the process , the boiled linseed oil must be applied sparingly , again and again , and rubbed in thoroughly after each application . Once a week for six months is not too much . A truly fine , deep finish for a beautifully grained piece of wood ( which will give a depth as though it were colored glass ) will evolve . It is resistant to the factors of use named in connection with the other oil finishes , and its upkeep is simply polishing with an oil-base furniture polish . It will darken with age and the dirt which ca n't help but cling to the oil . Some people will like this and others wo n't . A word about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and various qualities and imitations ) used widely . Once used only in palaces and temples , marble now performs for all of us when fashioned into tables , wall shelves , counter tops , and flooring . The steady , increasing growth of the marble industry over the last 15 to 20 years has brought back a flourishing trade almost extinct in this country . Before this past few years , there were only one or  | two marble workshops in our larger cities , manned by elder craftsmen of the old European school , whose prices were nearly prohibitive because of the customized service . Although increased production has cut costs considerably , there have been very few new innovations in the last quarter of a century in marble refinishing . The " rubbing bed " machines still level a sheet of marble to proper thickness . . . rubbing dish is iron , and water and sand are kept flowing across the rubbing bed to reduce the heat and smooth the marble . Although one new machine was tried for finishing the narrow edges , some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man does it better and quicker by hand than mechancially . Huge cutting wheels slice the slabs as easily as if they were butter , and there are machines to shape molded or beveled edges with a metal template slipped into the cutter to determine how the wheel cuts the marble . Naturally the use of machines will cut the cost of the product . Most of our marbles come from abroad , although we do have some American marble . Foreign marble is more heavily patterned and therefore more popular for decorative use . American marble , although plainer , has fewer flaws . The cost is about the same . As in woods , no two pieces of marble look alike , and they , too , have fissure , grains , and striations inherent in any product of nature . These are often the very qualities which contribute to the beauty of a piece . Imitations are very authentic on the part of a good manufacturer . Others are too slick and shiny with a glossy surface that has no depth . Cultured marble , like terrazzo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground under pressure . It has the look of solid marble , and its care is much the same , although it will be less expensive . Many potential buyers of furniture wonder how to tell a real bargain when they see so many sale advertisements in the daily papers . Most stores have pre-inventory sales of regular floor stock . These are usually legitimate bargains offered because they may be slightly shop-worn floor sam- pies , or the need is great for a stock reduction at tax time or just before much new merchandise is due to arrive . If certain pieces fit your needs and decorative scheme , they would be considered bargains . However , beware of special lots of furniture brought in for special sales . It often can not be called a bargain at any price , as the price asked is most likely only what an item of this type is worth . Its purpose is to attract prospective buyers to the store in hopes they will see other items more to their liking . There is a type of furniture called " Borax " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better furniture stores . It is hastily assembled of cheap materials and sold by disreputable stores at " bait " bargain prices . " Borax " is derived from borgen , to borrow , in German , and these stores usually sell on contract with high interest rates . It is almost impossible to break these contracts , even though the furniture falls apart , because of the legal phraseology involved . Such stores operate by means of an elaborate code worked out by consummate " gyp artists . " Since it is difficult to determine this type of store from a legitimate store , many people are duped , causing ill feeling against all furniture manufacturers . Unfortunately , the people taken in by this type of store and its advertising are those most unable to afford the replacement of their bad buys . The selection of upholstered furniture has its own considerations ; for we must know the great amount of unexposed parts of the piece , such as the frame construction , type of springs , the materials used for filling and stuffing , as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the surface upholstery . The frame in a good sofa or chair is constructed much the same as the case goods described earlier ; with joints doweled , corner blocks screwed and glued ( not nailed ) , hardwood throughout , and a feeling of solidity . Ideally , springs should be hand-tied to webbing and frame , be of quality steel , and with an adequate number of coils . In this  | day of high labor costs and fewer craftsmen , many reputable makers are using a hydracoil unit which is made of pre-fastened springs made all of a piece of high tension steel , and the whole unit attached to the frame with special clips replacing the traditional cord method . Its springs are all individually pocketed and wrapped in their own soft , man-made fiber for resilient , super-soft comfort , giving much the same appearance as the custom method at less cost . On some even less expensive sofas and chairs , a dropin unit is used , in which the springs are also made into a unit large enough to fit into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , using fewer coils in the springs , and the whole piece fastened to the frame with an over-size staple . The chances of this type of unit coming loose with use is very high . Often the wood used in its frame is so soft the staple will tear part of the frame loose when it gives way , making repair difficult . The webbing used should be of wide strips , closely interwoven , and securely fastened to the frame with large tacks . High quality webbing has red lines near the selvage edge , while poor quality has blue or black lines interwoven in or near the selvage , and its strips are narrower . Nearly every state requires a tag on each upholstered piece stating the type of material used in both filling and surface fabric , and also stating that all new material has been used . These are usually sewed into the decking under a loose cushion style , or on the dust cover fastened underneath the piece in a tight cushion style . This provides the buyer protection against paying for a better type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality fillings include horsehair , down , pin core foam of four or five inches in depth . Kapok , allcotton linters , thin foam with large cores ( holes ) are among the less durable materials . Coverings , as a rule , are graded and priced accordingly . Many upholstered pieces are offered with a choice of customized covers , with the price varying with the grade of fabric . It can be marked as grades 1 through 30 , or as grades  | A through Z , with the first several grades being the cheapest ( and of poorer quality ) , the middle grades average to excellent quality ( with a gradual increase in price ) , and the higher grades at the other end of the scale having superior quality , luxurious " hand " ( texture and feel ) , and highest price . Type of yarn , thread count , and weave enter into the determination of durability and value . Expert and reputable help can be valuable in making your choice . It is an unfortunate fact that most women buy first by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you will evaluate your choice somewhat more definitively , so that you will have a more satisfying purchase . Our predecessors would be astonished with the manmade materials , synthetic fibers , and mar-resistant finishes that were unknown before our time . Much of today 's traditional furniture is not too authentic . . . and it 's just as well ! When you curl up on a brand-new sofa in Colonial or French or Italian , you are often really lounging around on space-age materials , no matter how closely they look like the real thing . Fabrics of nylon can look like silk or velvet , those of acrylic can look like wool , and we 've already mentioned the vinyls , foam rubber , and others . With these innovations , plus many more , our ancestors never had it so good . To be completely accurate about it , the historically authentic chair of , say , Colonial days , was most likely to be a wooden captain 's chair or a deacon 's bench . Upholstery did not begin to emerge until close to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing chairs , sofas , and the like had only an excruciatingly thin layer of padding between our founding fathers and their furniture . No wonder the Colonists were restlessly moving to new territories for settlement ! They did n't have a comfortable chair to relax in at home ! For years we used Spanish moss to pad the springs , with cotton linters over the surface . This was adequate , but in time would mat so thoroughly  | the springs made themselves painfully known to the unwary sitter . Although the difference between Contemporary and present-day Traditional is " only skin deep " . . . that 's a good thing , comfort and quality-wise for all of us . Therefore , do n't be too die-hard traditional when you are buying good reproductions and find some of their make-up is different from its counterpart of museum quality . Since your sofa is the most prominent single piece of furniture in the living room ( and often the family room as well ) , its shape is very important . Because the creation of an all-upholstered piece is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sizable portion of your furnishing budget . Naturally you want and expect both comfort and good lines for your money . Do n't make the mistake of thinking that deep comfort is synonymous with bulging cushions , fat squishy arms , and a bulky overstuffed look . Real comfort and quality come in tidier packages , with perfect proportions and a neat appearance at all times . A slightly firm feel in new cushions will often denote better wearing propensities than those that sink in too readily . Your own inclinations will help you decide whether you want the loose cushion effect on seat and back , or attached ( tight ) cushioning on either or both places . The former is more casual and comfortable , but apt to look disarrayed easily . As for styles , there are five basic styles today from which most variations are made . Each of these classic designs has its own excellent silhouette . Within this shape it is often slightly modified for a versatile change , without a loss of identity . The Lawson style is always pleasing and the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " new look " of Contemporary . Slight modifications of arms from narrow , slightly sloping , to rounded ; subtle differences in the over-all basically square shape and its upholstery , infinite styles in the skirting , or no skirt at all . . . change it chameleon-like to fit any room decor . It is the most corn- monly displayed sofa on the scene today . The slim arm , whether curved or straight , and the moderately low straight back define its style no matter whether it is 2 , 3 , or 4-cushioned , loose or tight back . The graceful Chippendale shape has gently curving lines along its back with a sort of camel 's hump in the center . It has an elegant , delicate air , more conducive to formal living than feet-up lounging . Its gently curving back and high rolled arms have changed little from 18th century drawing rooms . It is not suited to skirts , for its legs add to its light , up-off-the-ground look . The sturdy wing-back rolled arm sofa is derived from a combination of Lawson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also variable to a degree , as backs can be high or low , skirts pleated or ruffled or boxed , buttoning on cushions is changed decoratively but purposefully to keep the back in place , as most of them have tight back or semi-attached cushions . Most sofas of this design are not adaptable to use with other styles , but they are charming in the Early American room . The All-American 20th century Tuxedo style is usually sophisticated and dressy . . . designed to give a townhouse air to any room . Its high back and arms usually maintain the same level within a rectilinear silhouette . It can have loose cushions , but often has biscuit tufting on sides and back , which supports the upholstery and adds a feeling of formality to the style . The crisp lines of Contemporary reflect a no-nonsense mood in its tidy tailoring and floating legs . It always has the continuous line of the arms flowing into the base , creating the effect of a cradle supporting the body of the sofa . Good construction is vitally important here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it vulnerable to poor workmanship . These basic styles are the one most frequently adapted to modern designing . There are other distinctive styles of  | past periods which we do n't see so often out of their own settings , and so we 'll not discuss them as part of average home furnishings . However , furniture designs have scarcely changed over the centuries . They have only been modified and adapted to the usage of the times . One gets the impression , from viewing many present day furnishings , that suddenly the very old is very new . In our headlong rush into tomorrow , lots of us are just discovering yesterday . We are having an open love affair with such things as country stores , antiques , vintage autos , old clothes , and old time movies . Is n't it then inevitable that sooner or later the romance would get around to the decor of our homes ? Good reproductions of periods past mingle with the functional efforts of modern living . Victorian consoles grace our halls , classic Italian Provincial lends its transitional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century Italian is reflected in Early Tudor ( English ) of the 16th century with its stretchered legs and simple adornments . It appears that the pendulum of style has swung back again to those earlier times with the heavier look of oak and pecan , beautifully fumed and distressed , and so handsomely practical for the lived-in room . Fruitwood is still magnificent and so popular for the opulent look in smaller-scaled pieces , both formal and country casual . The grace and charm of French Provincial can lean toward formality or informality depending on whether we use " city " ( court style ) or " country " French , and both are in excellent taste . In turn , country French is marvelously ambient with the less formal Queen Anne styles of rural England or even with some Colonial . Currently , the neoclassic Modern look of the thirties is making a revival , with metals and glass giving a see-through look to tables and chairs . The coldness and glisten of these is relieved with the use of lots of color surrounding them . Second only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decor , are chairs . Have you ever considered how important chairs are in your life ? Look around you .  | Every home contains several chairs to each sofa . They are used more frequently , and are replaced more often than other types of furniture . Although individually a smaller investment than a sofa , they help represent the style of the room , set the mood of a setting , whether it be a conversational grouping , a relaxing comfort area , or merely to point up a dramatic focal point . They should be chosen with the same care as to workmanship as the other pieces . Examine them in the same way you did the sofa . Fortunately , designing trends indicate a growing desire for higher quality in chairs of occasional or accent pieces , and the soft plush loungers for comfort . The answer to this desire is present in the ornamental treatment of exposed woods and richer fabrics on even the smaller chairs . This attention by designers gives the buyer a plus advantage in styling and value . In these days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popularity . We want our chairs to " do something " . . . rock , swivel , recline , vibrate , or whatever . We also want style , design , and comfort , as well as function in them . Witness , for example , the changes in recliners and club chairs , from heavy , hulking blobs of plastic to streamlined pieces of great elegance and lighter weight . . . handsome enough for the most formal living room , but still retaining maximum comfort . New developments in mechanisms and better construction plus highstyling , increases the acceptance of these and other mobiletype chairs in our decorating scene . ( Check mechanisms carefully ) . However , they are not new historically . We recall seeing museum prints of a " shoe-fly " chair with its foot treadle to keep the fly-switch moving over the sitter 's head ! Also shown was a lovely " modern " chair with a swivel mechanism which had been presented by a compatriot to George Washington and later owned by Andrew Jackson . Yet this is Contemporary enough for any setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the upholstered pieces , and this choice will be influenced by several factors . Entering into the selection will be the period of your furniture and the character of the room , formal or informal . Fabrics , in their many variations of surface treatment , have wonderful tactile qualities and esthetic appeal . They may be very smooth , shiny , rich , plain , or figured . They may be rough , coarse , and unevenly woven . All have variables which give them the power to attract or repulse or produce a different reaction in their surroundings , according to their characteristics . An appropriate mixture of balanced textures must be suitable to the style of furniture and the use of the room . Here again , scale , our measure of good taste and fitness , is paramount . One knows instinctively not to use fine satin with massive oak or ' pecan and such unlikely combinations , so we wo n't dwell on this aspect . Rather , let us think of fabrics as they would be properly used with certain periods . The traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ styles , and these give us a good gauge for our choosing . Classic fabric designs repeat the motifs of the representative periods , so they , too , enter into the choice . For example , crewel embroidery of 17th and 18th century England ( which was a local copying of East Indian print patterns with fine English wool on linen backgrounds ) was also the pride of Colonial households , and is now wonderfully reproduced on transitional sofas we use with so many informal periods . The classical artichoke or pineapple patterns of the Italian Renaissance are exuberently developed on cut velvet for a luxurious yet practical fabric much used today . These designs are also repeated in many accessories and lamp bases . The fine silk damask of the Louis XIV period was made possible after the influx of oriental silk into Europe with the opening of the Suez Canal . It was strengthened and redesigned into French Empire brocades with Napoleonic  | designs later . Art Noveau of the late Victorian period , with its natural forms of stems , leaves and florals , and Colonial flame-stitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flamboyant foil to the severe lines of Contemporary . With 18th century , or formal American Colonial , one can use chintzes , lighter weight brocades , antique satins , damasks , moires , reps , and velvets . . . all types of printing or weaving . In less formal Early American rooms chintzes , linens , and more simply woven fabrics are most appropriate . Early English and Spanish rooms , with their heavier treatments of architectural detail and furniture , call for coarsely-woven fabrics , brocatelles , heavy brocades , linens , crewel work , richly-piled velvet , and the like . The various Louis periods , the Directoire , and latter-day Italian express the formal style and keep company with fabrics of like character . These include satins , finely woven brocades , velvets , reps , toiles , and damasks , of the right motif . In the modern setting , all manner of interesting textures and weaves are available and appropriate . Rough textures in all types of fabrics , cottons , chenilles , linens , as well as hammered satins , failles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mood of the setting . Color combinations are now much more varied in modern textiles , and modern dyes are brilliant and long-lasting . These , in combination with the development of synthetic yarns , give us reproductions often much more functional than the originals . However , the methods of weaving today are fundamentally unchanged from the original methods used , other than that the looms are now power-operated . The main difference is in the variety of combinations of yarns and colors , and the mass production which makes them available to the average pocketbook as well as to kingly eschequers . We will discuss more about qualities and wearability in the drapery chapter .  | Color is the magic timepiece in the choice of a room setting . Nothing links a room to its time so precisely as color . The colors we use today give the unmistakable stamp of the present , even to a room filled with antiques . If we want to recreate the exact aura of the past , we have to search out and match the colors of history . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , decade by decade , without our being wholly aware of it . The change is far more subtle and comes about more slowly than a quick switch from a red to a green ( which is more apt to be a switch of personal taste ) . Subconsciously , we are drawn to a different kind of red , or a different kind of green . . . or we are prompted to put red and green together in a totally different way . Even if we repeat a basic color formula that worked well for us ten years ago , we are almost certain to arrive at a different look today . That 's all for the good , for this type of change is enrichment to our decor and exciting to our senses . . . but let 's identify the traditional colors used in some period interiors for the sake of authenticity , should we ever want to emulate them . The English room of the 18th century , influenced by Chippendale , Hepplewhite , Sheraton , and Adams , used wallpaper with grayed or neutralized background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream , delphinium blue , French blue , sage green , white , or pearl gray . Designs on them and fabrics of similar backgrounds were somewhat brighter , with small floral patterns , landscapes , Toiles , and classic motifs . The Spanish interior was greatly influenced by Italian and French styles , and their textiles incorporated luxurious and heavily embroidered effects in deep rich colors , used as a contrast to softly textured plastered surfaces of walls . We recall the tapestries and flocked wallpapers of the Louis XIV period mentioned in the history chapter , do n't we ? These were used against rich , deep colors of red and  | gold and blue , while Louis XV and XVI used more delicate colors with the tones of blues , rose , and soft green predominating . Then back to brilliant colors with Napoleonic rooms , which had deep , intense , sensuous tones . With New England Colonial , bright gay colors were used , with background tones of yellow , red , white , green , blue , or gray . Patterns were rather small and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal colors were pure colors of oyster white , gray , Pompeiian red , dark blue , dark green , and chocolate brown . Color makes tradition come alive . The color palette of early periods consisted of dyes and pigments available to the time and country . Most were made of native vegetable matter , or from the earth itself , and therefore each family of colors was characteristic of a particular epoch and country , just as ours are representative of the influences of modern technology . We can not live the lives of past generations , but we still want to have our comfortable ties with the past without turning our homes into inert period pieces . We shall live more richly in our own times if we learn how to take the best of the past and merge it with the best of the present . The real good of any era has an abiding vitality , a timelessness that makes it enduringly appealing , enough that we may even accept it as new . There is room for the past in the present ! An individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a mingling of periods and cultures from around the world . By their very nature , period pieces have a natural place in the gracious scheme with no sacrifice of comfort for beauty in their modern adaptations . With all the talk about reproductions , there are also many questions to be answered about antiques and the identification of old pieces found or inherited . This is a fascinating study and so involved most of us do not claim to be experts on the subject . However , it is a pursuit of great interest and intriguing possibilities , and half the fun of looking for a  | " find " is that ever-present chance of owning a priceless piece . We are always sure we 'll find it around the next bend at that out-of-the-way shop . Do n't discount the possibility of finding something of interest while you 're snooping around , but just because things are old does not necessarily mean they are good , let alone valuable . The average person should rely on his fancy , imagination and well-developed taste in selecting old pieces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or without modifications of style in order to adapt them to home needs . These old finds , with a little work , will add greatly to a room and a budget regardless of their actual value on the antique market . It is n't prudent for anyone except an expert in the trade to advise a customer which antiques will appreciate in value . . . and the very restorative measures the layman will often take will spoil the museum quality of a valuable piece . For official purposes , the U. S. Customs Office has set the date of 1830 as the dividing line of antiquity , but as a rule most collectors consider an item an antique if it was produced over 100 years ago . Some period pieces date so far back that even some later reproductions of these are now regarded as antiques . This development evolved the use of the term " of the period , " which applies only to authentic pieces made during the actual period and not to later copies . No period or style was absolutely perfect , and there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is mere age . Rather than rely on our own inexperienced judgment or spend a small fortune on a piece which may or may not be of museum quality , most of us vent our creative urges on unusual old articles we can restore and remake into interesting pieces for our own homes . The results are rewarding , and the costs are small . We shall discuss some of the ways of simple restoration in a later chapter .  | It is hoped that by now you are beginning to feel that you can decorate your home in the way you 've always wanted .

You will perhaps wonder why the seemingly simple process of placing furniture in a room is left until so late in the book . It was because you needed first to give careful consideration to the subjects embodying the other art elements and principles of design before you could apply them in a well-organized composition . A well-arranged room is just that . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which embodies care in selection , and is covered with textiles properly scaled to the furnishings and to the room . The arrangement of furniture means more than the consideration of the furniture pieces and where they will be placed , however . First consider the architectural background of the room . Few of us design the shapes of our rooms , and therefore we must work within the designs and proportions given us by the architect . Here is a sample of an actual small living room and adjoining all-purpose room which I decorated for a bachelor client . ( See floor plan 1 . ) His needs included as much seating as possible , because of his love of entertaining . The floor plan shows on wall A , a rather large Spanishstyle fireplace symmetrically placed between two high windows . Wall B has a door and wall heater at one end which produces an asymmetrical arrangement and a loss of usable space . Wall D also has a door at one end and one window which is nicely situated . Wall C has a more awkward arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an arch on the right , with the remaining space to its right having to be left for the entry door to swing back . No entry hall is provided . This is not such an unusual type  | of room plan in a small home , but it does present several features worth considering . The main center of interest is obviously the fireplace wall . Because of its dominance , the other walls having no interesting details as yet , plus a lack of space for good furniture placement , we are presented a problem . We must offset some of these disadvantages with the use of small-scale furniture , color , texture , and unusual accessories in combination with these architectural elements ; as well as the function the young client wants from his room . Perhaps you will want to turn back to Chapter Two and check the elements or principles of design that will make this room a success . Primarily review ideas of symmetrical and occult balance at this point . You will note that a minor center of interest can be provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireplace unit . Here ( on wall C ) was the right place for the long stereo which was requested as a must in the home . Over if , we placed a fairly large painting to add to the balance and interest . This wall would not have been good for a seating arrangement of any kind because the traffic flow to all rooms has to pass here . One minor grouping was placed on Wall D , with the pair of small upholstered swivel chairs flanking an appropriate table . This group was , in turn , balanced by the short ( 78 " ) sofa on the opposite side of the fireplace , with its table and tall slender lamp " anchoring " it to the wall . These groups are well-related to the fireplace and to an additional conversation-oriented fireside bench facing a man 's high back chair . This chair is not only a part of the grouping , but defines the traffic behind it to the bedroom wing . The fireside bench is also well-related to the pair of chairs as another conversation grouping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet of one another , and these are within that . To form a feeling of a set-apart entry , albeit small , a decorative screen simulating wrought iron was added floor  | to ceiling , beside the front door . It added little apparent weight with its open spaces , but its feeling of Spanish design added a nice accent . Through the arch to the right of the entry , we added a multi-purpose room of great charm . Although the archway is small , the view between the two rooms means there must be a balanced correlation of color areas . These will be mentioned later . In this small former dining room there had to be a number of variable objects felt necessary to the function asked of the room . The request was for a combination game and dining table with adequate lighting over it ; a place for books and closed storage space for cards , etc. ; plus a television set and seating . As you can see , there is a bad traffic lane through the room , and one wall ( E @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swinging back against the low window . To relieve the awkward corner between walls E and F , we draped it along with the windows for an unbroken line not distracting to our vision , and placed the television in front of it . A comfortable ottoman sits to its left . With its casters it provides easily-movable extra seating for either room . On the right of the window on Wall F , we added a small free-standing bookstack with cupboards beneath . In the same corner in front of the bookstack was placed the game table and chairs . Over it a hanging lamp was added , the chain of which arched gracefully over to the walls and down it to a plug-in . This added a decorative transitional effect and eliminated the need for a change of wiring , ( as this type of lamp is self-contained with a set of brass hooks included for attaching to the ceiling . A switch is either in the cord which is enclosed in the decorative chain , or a pull-type in the lamp itself . ) On the wall left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small Tuxedo style chairs with a table between for snacks and coffee items , convenient for watching television or kitbitzing on the game in progress in the other corner . In the two rooms , we  | accomplished both good arrangement and function and a maximum of seating without overcrowding . Let 's think about the rules of arrangement which made it possible . Consistent with space limitations , objects should be arranged according to balance , rhythm ( repetition ) for movement , and emphasis for interest . Consistency of shape and line requires that all major cabinet ( case ) pieces of furniture be placed parallel or at right angles to the walls of a room ( a television set is the only exception , of necessity ; and because of this and the necessity of major seating orientation to it , is nearly impossible in a living room that is going to have any semblance of balance . ) Frame pieces of furniture such as chairs and tables may be placed in any desired angle for comfort and convenience . One exception is the sofa , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls ( while not necessarily right against them , however ) , or at right angles to them . This rule is made necessary by its size ; as it will fit the room and look better , while wasting less space than it would cocked at any angle . There are times when it sets out in the room , as for instance , when one or two of them flank a fireplace in a large room , or one is used facing a center of interest with its back forming a nice room-divider . . . but it is always parallel or at right angles with the walls . When possible , when using it on a wall area , a sofa should be placed against the largest wall available , and at the same time balancing a large decorative unit on the opposite side of the room , such as a view window , a fireplace , or a grouping of furniture . The back of a sofa should never be seen through a window from the outside . Here 's the spot for a " see-through " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a table , a desk , or game table and chairs . . . and please , not the largest lamp you own plunked in the center ! When coming in from the entry , one should be attracted by one of the centers of interest , and see open spaces for easy and hospitable access into the room . It is forbidding to see  | the back of a sofa or a very large chair . . . it gives one a mental block about entering . If a low table with attractive accessories can be placed behind the sofa , then this is fine , as you feel a part of this type of arrangement . . . a twoway view , so to speak . Passage lanes should be allowed around major furniture groupings , or between corners of furniture and built-ins . If it is a regular traffic way , then at least three feet should be allowed . The barest minimum would be 2 ' 6 " , and this around minor groupings only . Speaking of easy access , one must also think of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables we place in front of sofas . For ease of entry to the area as well as use of the table surface while sitting , we must allow a certain amount of space for both functions . This is usually about thirteen to fifteen inches . Furniture should be placed in a room according to its various uses . A house which is disarranged after use by the family or visitors shows poor judgment in furniture arrangement . Chairs and sofas should be grouped for conversation , with large pieces following the lines of the room and balancing one another . Entertainment , rest , music , or reading centers form their own groups as needed . Most furniture is wastefully arranged when it is isolated into individual placings , or if lighting is inadequate . Lamps must be placed where they are convenient and useful for the type of use they are to be put ( reading , writing , sewing , television , game playing . ) Lighting flexibility incorporates a general illumination which fills the room evenly and adequately , showing up the texture of fabrics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with no glare or contrast of light and dark areas , where eye fatigue might result . ( We shall go into lighting function in detail later . ) As you noted on the sketch , I used a scale drawing incorporating 1/4 inch to one foot . This is an easy size to use , and it is possible to make or buy furniture cut-outs on the same  | scale so that you can shift your own pieces around on paper and derive the maximum pre-planning benefit according to your personal needs . So far , we have dealt solely with the aspect of arrangement of the furniture , the amount of space each piece demands in a room , and its relationship with the other pieces , but now we must think also about its vertical composition as well . One must be careful to avoid monotonous arrangements and groupings of nearly the same height . Referring back to our sample room , you will note that the strong vertical of the fireplace and its flanking draped windows , was balanced by the large vertical of the painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hung off center to the right , to balance the bedroom door on the left ; with an art object of intermediate height placed on the left of the stereo . The low chairs on Wall D were opposed by the draped window behind them as well as the hanging lamp with its chain following a transitional line to the corner and on down the wall . The lamp to the right of the fireplace in turn balanced that wall and gave a graceful flowing movement between the low sofa and the drapery height . These various heights , as those in the adjoining room as well , are the elements of variety that are necessary to the over-all composition of the " skyline " in a room . In arranging furniture , always mix the upholstered and wood pieces in each area . Too much wood gives a cold , hard effect , and too much upholstery used together gives an overbalanced , stuffy effect . Light colors , floor-to-ceiling draperies blended with the wall tone , wall-to-wall carpeting , all give an aura of spaciousness . See-through furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to take up less room than they really do . A blending of carpet and upholstery fabric will further the illusion . This does not mean they are a perfect match , but that their tone transition is gradual , and their patterns are somewhat muted with closely related harmonies .  | Textures and patterns are important in any room . The secret of using textures well lies in varying them . " Something rough , something smooth , something in between , " is a good rule to apply to your decorating scheme . A combination of diversified textures and patterns should be included in any room ; and of course , these should complement each other . If textural effects are planned well , your decorating is raised above the ordinary level . When we mention something smooth and something rough we were talking about something different than " coarse and fine . " We mean a depth of texture . . . it can be a casual rough tweed or a more formal deep pile velvet . Smooth can mean satin or it can mean leather or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of texture to its use and surroundings . Texture can mean bulk or airy space ; it can reflect light or absorb it . . . each having its impact in scale and affecting proportion . Patterns have the same impact as texture does on surroundings . Their scale , based on whether they are large or small , loose or tight in design , has its own bearing in the room . Patterns can be used together with other patterns , or with varying degrees of textures in plain colors . Again , it is all a matter of scale and balance . Any room will be overdone with too much texture or pattern of the same or nearly the same type if it 's heavy . . . or dull , with a never-ending continuity of the same type of fine ones . Variety is the important answer . You do realize that we are not just talking about fabrics , although they are very important . We mean also all other surfaces of the room . Brick is a rough texture , plaster can be both , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textures of furniture woods enter in . Do n't be too obvious in your choice of these textural balances nor in your furniture arrangements . You do n't want them to look stilt-ed or self-conscious . Interior decoration is the art of taking available space and making it work better , look better . Let 's take the interior of any home , room by room , idea by idea , and share some plan- ning thoughts as we go . In this way we shall develop this art . Almost everyone would like to have a warm , hospitable home . . . one that invites you to enter and enjoy yourself . Start with the entry hall . It can be made to reveal the character or mood of your home . It serves as your background as you greet friends at the door and bid them welcome or farewell . It is their first and last impression of your home . It is usually too small for furniture , so wall accessories of the proper scale will relieve its monotony . In a small hall , they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is important . It should , however , be eye-catching , so that the transitory view one has of it on the way past will be interesting . This can be the sparkle of a brass branch or wall sconce ( candelabra ) , or a group of small paintings . If there is room for a console table , small shelf , or antique chest , you have the start of a good point of emphasis , and you are on the way to an unusual vignette . Hang a mirror over it to further the illusion of space and so milady can have a quick peek at her hairdo and a place to lay gloves and purse . If there is very little wall area , consider treating the doors with a contrasting color ( if they are well-placed ) and add a plaque to one of them for an unusual effect . Or paper them with the same striped wallpaper as you might choose for the walls , which would nearly hide them and create more space . This is especially good with several doors which would otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall . To add light , use built-in lighting in the ceiling or lighted panels on the wall . This latter is very dramatic seen behind potted plants where space is too limited for any furniture unit . It is easy and inexpensive to do . Any good lumber yard or building supply company carries translucent acrylic panels in many design motifs , already framed if you wish . Plug in a small light behind it , and it looks built-in with only a simple attaching of the frame to the wall with screws . Of course you will have added enough depth to the back of the frame to provide space for a small light . This is done by  | " framing " it again on the back side with a 2-or-3 inch board , or to the depth necessary to enclose the light bulb without crowding it . This is painted either the wall or the frame color . It is so practical to add easy-care tile to the floor in one of the many new shapes and shades . Some can be laid over existing floors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , use a decorative screen such as was mentioned in the sample room already discussed . These come in a high impact plastic which looks like wrought iron , and are sturdy enough for the addition of a small painting if desired . Their floor-to-ceiling frame includes a spring-tension device which anchors them firmly . Make a small curved area of tile about the scope of the opening door . This will define the area and most practically catch the first footprints before they reach the carpet or floor beyond . Even if you have only a small corner , do something with it to soften its bleakness and make it pretty . It is usually wise to treat a hall that is visible from an adjoining room as a continuation of that room , as to the color and furnishing mode . The same idea holds true for stairways and gallery halls frequently found in split-level homes . Visually , these are a part of the room which they overlook and therefore a compatibility of decor must be used . Shorten a long hall with a splash of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A good painting , bright wall hanging , or wallpaper will do the trick . If a door or window are at the far end , they would be treated the same way ; the window having its frame the same color as its walls and the window covering in a matching fabric . The side walls along the passage would be kept light , and the ceiling , too , as a rule . If the height of the ceiling seems high in proportion to the width of the hall , treat the ceiling with a deeper color in paint or wallpaper , perhaps bringing a border of the paper down in a cornice effect . If you would like the softness of wallpaper on the walls and they are too close together for a  | pattern , use one of the many grass cloth textures , and then add your " rogues 's gallery " of family photographs or silhouettes , a collection of antique plates , or small prints hung gallery style . Lengthen the effect of a short hall with a " fool-the-eye " wallpaper at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " into a scene of three-dimensional perspective . Adding a paper with a dado effect about three feet from the floor will continue to widen the vista . Do n't use patterns on the side walls which would be so wild as to close you in , nor colors in paints that are too advancing . Be certain that any doors that you color blend with the room which they happen to open into . You can change the illusion of a square hall , or lengthen that short hall a different way again with a large mirror or an entire wall of mirror tile ( these come in do-ityourself units with self-adhesive on the back , either in plain or antique glass ) . The working hallway , or one that can do multi-purpose duty is a gem found only in spacious old homes ( or new ones if you can work it into the plans ) . It can be more than a passage way . Taking off old wardrobe or closet doors and removing a few shelves opens up new areas for use as desk space , laundry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . Hinged shutter doors replace the old ones where enclosure is needed for hidden storage . The room most often seen from the entry is the living room . Here is where you like to put your best decorating foot forward , so let 's analyze it carefully . Study the orientation of the room . This will predetermine , to a large extent , what centers of interest you will play to , and whether warm or cool colors will prevail , according to the direction it faces . If the view is outstanding , the room colors and furnishings will be subordinated to it . These will be determined largely on whether the view will feature cool green woods or magnificent sunsets ( to start with decorating extremes ) and blended to the corresponding degree of similar views and directional orientation . This concept of planning is more important  | than some beginning home decorators would consider , so it needs explaining . A cartoon I recently viewed puts it rather succinctly . Seated in front of a large picture window , one lady is saying to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All that pink and purple clash so dreadfully with the draperies . " Funny , yes ; but sad in reality , that the view was ignored in the planning of a room . A decorator always gives a view primary consideration . Not all of us in towns and cities are faced with this charming dilemma , so if you have no view nor other major inside center of interest either ( a fireplace for instance ) make your own with a spotlighted scenic mural on a strategic wall . It also might seem unimportant that a living room is on the cool or warm side of the house , and in a very moderate year-round climate it is not as important as it would be in one of greater extremes of heat and cold . When these factors are present , however , treating the room colors in those opposite outside conditions will make a great deal of difference in comfort . Next to be considered is to what use will the room be put for family living , consistent with the space available ? Will it be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas of traffic between ? Will you need reading nooks or places for quiet listening to music ? Are you the type of active young modern who likes activity throughout the home ( or do you have no choice because of the size of your home ? ) Are you one of more elegant persuasion who might choose a traditionally formal living room , and relegate the activity to the family room ?  | PARLORS ARE FOR PRETTY ! Just as the Victorian family had two parlors ; one in the front for show , the other in the back for family living , so today many of us have two rooms . . . one for formal entertaining , the other for everyday family use . With the one for family habits and pastimes , turning at will into a hobby shop , sewing room , or teen-age party room , the other can be as formal as the older generation of the household prefers . Its character can be correct and elegant with no wear and tear of multi-purpose use . . . and is n't it nice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any time of day ? No need for a misplaced sneaker or left-over bowl of peanuts lurking around to shatter the illusion of your perfect housekeeping ! Here is where one can achieve the longed-for decor of her dreams in perfect taste , and yet not feel guilty that she is disrupting the informality of everyday family living and relaxation in the " lived-in " parlor , or family room ; where functional materials of wood , brick , plastic , tweedy or plaid materials take the hard wear a family gives . Having the two " parlors " serves a dual purpose when parents are entertaining simultaneously with the younger set . The formal room , with its arrangement of conversational groups , warmth , and beauty of a more classic decor sets the stage for memorable occasions or a quiet retreat from the activity area . Formality need not be cold and uninviting . Many of the wonderful reproductions and other things we can buy today we could n't buy yesterday ( considering yesterday as a decade or so ago ) , unless we plunked. down a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get in the same time period because they were not being made yet . . ? . all the wonderful acrylics which can look like stained glass in panels or super plush but highly wearable in carpets , vinyls for tops of counters , tables , or in floor tiles or as a coating on washable wall coverings . This is only a start on the many other new arrivals on the decorating scene in recent years . The best of today 's houses and furnishings harness quali- ties which were once thought hard to join . They blend elegance with easy maintenance . . . combine good design with true comfort without a loss of either . Furniture of the coming years will be more practical , easier to care for , and still more comfortable . The past decade saw more diversity in design than any previous recent decade , made possible by advancing technology . One can truly have any decor one wants whether it 's traditional or contemporary , old or new . New ideas , like the sturdy oak , spring from tiny acorns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active , disciplined thought rather than a do-or-die pursuit of the new for newness ' sake , they will quietly grow in acceptance . Soon they gain in popularity and set a precedent for future growth . This has happened to several styles in home furnishings . The one really new one was the blown-up plastic throw-away chair designed as a part of our plastic-covered , disposable way of life in the sixties . Time will show us whether this idea catches on for the majority . For most of our " silent majority " of homemakers , there has been a recent return to the warmth and beauty of a more classic decor . . . but elegance is not allied with any one period . It is at home among contemporary furnishings , antiques , or anywhere between . It can be achieved , with no sacrifice of solid comfort , and that 's what most of us want . Today 's interior tends to be plain , encouraging the use of furniture which contributes a strong ornamental accent or look of architectural importance . This look , embodied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well to the larger space . For the gay , active family , the giddy fusion of exuberant shapes and lavish color handed to us from Old World Spain and Morocco generates as much excitement in a room as anyone could ask for . Against background less quiet than the stark neutral walls of its original home , this brilliance could be overpowering . Conversely , it is a wonderful way of enlivening the box-like  | rooms of tract homes and apartments ( used size-wise in its modified , Americanized scale ) . The hand-hewed look of the wood and the deep colors and textures of the upholstery are marvelous choices for a growing family , while not losing its possibilities of drama in any lively decor . While some of the finishes in this style are refined and formal adaptations , others have finishes so primitive that all the care they need is an occasional brushing with a shoe brush and polish . Its Italian neighbor , either classic or contemporary , is setting a precedent for the continuing love of traditional blended with modern living tastes . Graceful lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant , rather elegant room of uncluttered mien . Another popular look , designed as classic modern , has a simplicity of line that makes the larger pieces such , as book stacks or credenzas , look as though they were part of the structure of the room . These components are designed for your individual needs of arrangement in various widths called modular units . They could be obtained only a few years ago on a made-to-order basis through a decorator , or by having them built in as a part of the architectural structure . Some are special designs for special purposes which could very well be your own , because they do take on an architectural-like detail while being less expensive than a remodel job that would give the same effect and function . ' I chose a combination of Contemporary and modified , modernized Spanish of small scale for the bachelor 's home , with woods of dark pecan and walnut , set on wall-to-wall shag carpeting of bronze green ( medium dark green and gold ) . This blended with the upholstered pieces in variations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a textured rep blending soft striations of bronze green and turquoise which correlated with the patterned sofa in a small geometrically designed Mediterranean motif of the same bronze green and turquoise . The high back chair was  | in a lighter shade of bronze green leaning more to the antique gold . The painting frame and lamp bases were dark , with lamp shades off-white . All of this was set against Spanish off-white walls and draperies . ( Perhaps you would like to check these color balances against the room layout as we go along ) . The fireplace , because of its size , was painted the same color as the walls in order to minimize its proportions . A smaller abstract oil with horizontal outline was hung over the sofa . . . the major painting being over the stereo , and also abstract . These correlated colorwise with the room , and introduced the combination of modern design along with the continuation of the Mediterranean theme in the adjoining all-purpose room . Walnut and pecan were the woods , again . The upholstery colors in here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporating a mediumsize floral on the pair of chairs , emboldened by the use of black leather on the game table chairs . The ottoman picked up an orange tone from the floral , and added a complementary harmony to the turquoise notes in the living room ( seen , as you recall , through the arch ) . Harmony of colors and woods served to pull the two rooms together in a separate , but well-coordinated atmosphere designed to give an illusion of more space , while meeting personal needs . These materials and this color scheme worked out most successfully for a particular individual . This does not mean they were the only choice available ( although they were the first choice of this decorator and client ) . Three or four other sofa fabrics and as many correlating chair and carpet fabrics could have been correlated suitably and effectively . There is no such thing as the one rug color , or anything else that is right for a particular scheme . Several can be right ; hundreds can be wrong . It is the personal , definitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , which settle the final decision . If you have to make compromises for reasons of availability , budget , or the like , keep an open mind . Here  | is where your attention to the elements and principles of decoration will be invaluable in correlating a room from choices which are available to you . The perfectly proportioned room is rare , yet with careful planning the worst room can achieve a feeling of charm and distinction . . . or just plain comfort , if that is all one seeks ( although it is hoped that you will aspire to more ) . Among the more common shapes is the long narrow room . This type of room can be made to seem wider with light walls and furniture that blends rather than contrasts . Softer upholstery colors are better , with the larger wood pieces painted andlor glazed rather than dark-toned woods . Avoid wide coffee tables in front of the sofa , and use some round tables here and there to relieve the angular look of the room- . Pedestal tables will help , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Foreshorten the length with a color accent on , or in front of , whichever narrow end wall commands the most interest . The arrangement of a conversation group in a circle , accented by an area rug , adds interest and breaks up the length ( a semi-circle is all right if space is severely limited . ) If a fireplace happens to be on one of the long walls , it must be painted the same color as the walls . This will widen the apparent width of the room by two or three feet . If you feel the bricks are too handsome to be painted , all the more reason they should be . . . as it is obvious they are attracting too much attention and thereby narrowing the room too much . You will forget the initial shock you feel at this suggestion when you see the results . The L-shaped room ( aside from being an interesting movie of some time back ) is an architectural invention of this century . It satisfies a growing need for light and space in a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , must perform many duties . The missing dining room often shows up in one of the ells , or it may It may combine both . It may convert into a study area or  | music corner , leaving the rest of the room free for more general activities . In any event , the decoration of it should set it apart from the rest of the room without making it distinctly different . Wall-to-wall carpeting can be used in one area , hard tile in the other , or the whole room unified with carpeting plus an area rug to define the dining area or the living room grouping . Screens , wall dividers , draperies , or a tall piece of furniture may separate the various areas . In all instances , the furniture in the two areas blends , but does not necessarily match . A correlation of color area is very important to maintain a unity of thought . Let 's take some typical house plans having the L-shaped room , with their very real problem spots , and solve them realistically for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All plans are drawn on scale , 1/4 ' to a foot ) . Plan A : This layout embodies the most common use of the L shape . . . that with a dining room at one end . This plan has the entry door in a rather poor place ; a very awkward window in the corner of wall B ; a large sliding window wall on wall G with access to the patio ; and a nearly direct traffic pattern between the kitchen and bedroom wing . This house plan is widely used in some parts of the country in tract homes . It does not leave much leeway in the placement of furnishings ; but as you can see , careful planning can give much function to the home . Draping the corner , and creating the illusion of another window on wall C the same width as the real one on wall B gives a balance here plus a nice background for the lamp and table necessary in the corner . Two matching sofas , one somewhat smaller of necessity , will add less rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unity . If one did not feel the need for the two , or is restricted too much by budget ; one sofa and a club chair matching both in style and color , on wall C will be a satisfactory substitution . Because the fireplace is in a restricted area space-wise , and because of the need for access to the sliding window  | ( door ) on the right of wall G , a pair of chairs is a good choice in this area . A television set could be placed in the corner to the left of the fireplace instead of a chair and thus receive maximum viewing precedence . The desk serves to gently divide the two different areas without an addition of vertical weight . The free form outline of the carpet further divides the two rooms , and the use of a correlating tile in the dining area is handsome and practical . Plan B : This floor plan is that of a typical city apartment designed for a single occupant , still using the L shape . The built-in bed-couch on wall C has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fourth , or room side , to give it a pullman effect . This can be further enhanced with the addition of tie-back draperies and a valance within the frame . We have added a small china cupboard on its right for storage of dining implements . The large case piece to the left of the entry could be a stereo , television , piano , or parson 's table . A hanging lamp serves the reading chair ; the small table serves the chair and the bed as well . Two decorative free-standing screens ( or the floor-to-ceiling type ) provide an inexpensive but charming division between the kitchen and dining area . Should there be no built-in bed ; one of the good-looking " hide-a-beds " ( combination sofa and pull-out bed ) would be used in its place . One could use the draped pullman effect by attaching a bend rod for the valance and draperies to the ceiling and tying them back in the same fashion . If this was not used , the tall china cupboard could be better placed on wall F , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A small table could then be used at the right of the sofa with an additional lamp on it . In most apartments there is no view to consider , but instead , cold uninteresting inner walls and a lack of space . We must create interest when it 's not there . . . set our own stage for drama , with special lighting effects and color as a background for an interesting and unusual treatment of some part of the room .  | Plan C : This plan has the same dimensions as the others , but with no fireplace and a change of windows . It has been designed for the use of a music-oriented family who also love to entertain . We have centered the organ on wall B , and then surrounded it with floor-to-ceiling book shelves with storage beneath , and high shelves over the instrument itself . Under the last shelf above it , we have added a tube fluorescent light . Nestled in the shelves are the stereo components and speakers , racks for music and records , and a slanted shelf for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available in linear foot-lengths in many woods , both stain and paint-grade , plus brackets for wall-mounting or free-standing frames . The shelf brackets simply hook into either one with the slots for them neatly provided . This is an inexpensive way to a custom look and much function . The two sofas on the opposite wall balance the other arrangements and provide seating for a number of people . The use of a scenic mural on wall E will give a feeling of space . If it is lighted with a ceiling spot or lighted cornice , the illusion will be greatly enhanced . Plan D : Here is our same plan again , but with a corner window and the fireplace moved over a bit . ( Such variation is often found in tract homes ) . This family pursues the quiet life , with reading and card playing their main interests . The interesting addition to this room is the built-in bookcase on wall D , further dramatized by the raising of the floor at this end of the room ( up to 18 inches in a room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risers , up 12 inches with two such steps in a room with an 8-foot ceiling . ) The raised area is defined with an interesting railing attached to the wall at either end and about 32 inches in width . This leaves an entrance opening of 42 inches in the center . There is room for a server on wheels at the left , convenient to the kitchen and useful for carrying meals and snacks to the dining-game table . A small stool on the right provides another casual seat . . . neither piece of furniture will hide the  | decorative effect of the railing . A simulated window of acrylic with a light behind gives an aura of light in the reading corner , giving one the feeling of the charming old bay window nook . Further functional lighting is added with an overhead " eyeball " spot , or a wall lamp on one of the decorative brackets in a style to suit the room image . This entire room would be cozier carpeted , including the small stairs . For a young , active modern family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but with a brightly patterned carpet to define it as a special , separate area . With a number of cushions thrown about for seating , this makes a great conversation place . Modern ball ( globe ) lights hung low on brass rods are very effective , and how about hanging some free-form ashtrays on chains to add to the fun ? By eliminating the book-case wall until tastes and budget change , and adding a wall-to-wall mirror instead , the room will seem twice again as large and gay . Another common room with many problems is the small rectangular one with off-center doors and fireplace ( or a corner fireplace ) . ( See sketch of actual room ? plan E ) . This room is further limited by a lower wall heating unit , #11 on drawing . We must consider balance , arrangement , lighting , traffic , and storage for extra ashtrays , vases , etc. , within these limits of space . The request for a stereo space must also be met . The only place for the sofa is below the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this window was 32 inches from the floor , so the sofa was hidden from the outside view . Because there was no other means of achieving a symmetrical balance in the room and the need for lighting was paramount , a pair of matching tables and lamps was used ( #2 ) . The tall slender lamp bases along with the vertical movement of the draperies gave a nice balance to the fireplace on the opposite wall . A decorative bombe chest in an antiqued colored glaze completed the fireplace wall to the left of the door . A long mirror with frame matching the chest gave it importance , and its reflectance of the opposite outdoor view widened the room 's vista . The stereo  | ( #9 ) was placed on the wall near the door , with a wall lamp on its bracket serving it and the nearby chair . A small decorative floor-to-ceiling screen added our small entry feeling once again beside the door . Small stools were placed in front of the fireside for extra seating . These are but a few of the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs within space limitations . ( We shall discuss rooms later which will be too large or boxy , and how to make an integrated setting out of barn-like interiors . This will continue the illusions of space with which one is concerned , whatever the size of the room . ) Some of the special considerations to be given the smaller room include scale , which is important in accessories as well as in the major pieces of furniture . A small room is often ruined with the addition of a massive lamp , chunky piece of statuary , or over-sized picture in an otherwise harmonious setting . The " cult of clutter " is all about us presently , but simplified color areas are easier to live with . For smaller rooms , a two-color plan is practical and inviting , but always make sure one is a warm color . Many city apartments and small tract homes can use a smooth flow of color to make them seem larger and more invitingly cozy at the same time . Usually a soft gold leaning to the paler hue will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all walls , upholstery can blend or contrast in the second color , which might be turquoise or orange . Another example would be walls of soft green with a red chair and red in small accessories , with the addition of white in other articles . The warmth of a metallic gold in some of the accessories adds a lot to this scheme . A soft transition from a two-color to a three-color using adjacents would be : Off-white walls and sofa with a shag carpet and one or two chairs in soft warm tones of gold , apricot , and melon ( yellow , yellow-orange , and orange families ) . In this scheme the chairs might be either a plaid or pattern in these colors , the carpet in a tweedy mixture or wide striations of the same colors.  | If you like a definite three-color plan , two of the colors may be cools , with the one warm color brought out in accessories . This thinking will further implement the illusion of space . This scheme invites the outdoors in , and is especially good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greens in walls , draperies , and carpeting . This will make the outer atmosphere flow right in unimpeded . Accent this serenity with a nice contrast in bright flower tones in accessories . If you prefer paneling on the walls in place of paint , any of the handsome wood tones underscore the same mood , with the rest of the room 's components staying the same . In an intermediate , warm-cool three-color scheme , one could use all relatively cool tones such as soft lime-green ( yellow green on the warm side ) in both sofa and walls ( or in the sofa against a warm walnut wall paneling ) , with adjacent cool colors of purple , green , and blue in an area rug , pillows , vases , and other accessories . Before we leave the living room , we must give special thought to the fireplace , which has been made the center of interest in many rooms . A fireplace adds distinction to a home . It increases livability , doubles the house 's charm , helps to sustain its value over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new home , or adding to an older one , you can be certain that your architect incorporates your ideas into a fire-place of undeniable good looks and convenience to your room . The small , poorly designed ones in many existing homes may be given added importance with very little cost and imagination . This can be accomplished in many ways . Bookcases and storage can be added around it , whether it is centered to its wall area or not ( and often serve to bring an unbalanced wall into focus ) . If you wish to eliminate the mantel entirely and modernize the look , you can face the entire wall with stone , or add paneling about it flush with the old mantel , starting at the ceiling and continuing down the sides . . . making a handsome background for an important accessory . We can also add an  | exciting focal point by placing a few well-spaced strips of wood , fitted a few inches away from the wall between the ceiling and mantel and incorporating a picture or wall plaque in its design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or adding an inset shelf for a sculptured piece . With a hidden back light , the impact is stunning . If you are traditionally inclined , and your fireplace is not , add a more important mantelpiece supported by well-designed corbels . ( It 's an easy do-it-yourself project with ready-made units ) . This will give you a stage ideal for showcasing a few of your treasured heirlooms . Although we talked earlier of " pushing the proportions " of a fireplace back into the wall with paint when necessary , we did n't eliminate its importance as a focal point in the room . Actually , its merging color-wise with the walls will serve to accent any wall or mantel accessory used over it , and they will look fresher and more outstanding as a result . An inglenook is a modest home improvement which adds a decorative flair to an ordinary fireplace , and the style can be ultra-modern or New England cozy . The idea is to build a storage bench with a hinged lid on either side of the fireplace for three or four feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's built on the narrow end of a room . Padded cushions make comfortable seating , and shelves can be added above for books and art objects . Within the bench will be lots of added storage for wood , old magazines , or toys . There are several twists possible in design changes to suit your own needs . One may also keep on building out at right angles to form fireside settles facing one another , if the design of the room allows . This would eliminate permanently the need for upholstered pieces in the area . The fireside has for centuries served as a focal point of domestic living . There is n't a better place in the world to sit and dream or spend the evening with a good book or congenial friends . . . but make sure you are n't sitting on those cold nights before a " poorly dressed " fireplace . There is an art to decorating and to screening a fireplace beauti- fully . First you must select the proper type of screen for the best function of your fireplace . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireplace is built of heavy , uneven stones , it is difficult to get a good fit with an attached screen because of the varying measurements the stones will give within the opening . If the opening is of smooth brick , but rather small , an attached screen seems to be of better proportions , for it calls less attention to the area . Next , one should select the style of screen one likes and that will best fit the room and other furnishings . Along with the style comes the proper finish to correlate with it . Decide on the frame or top bar finish and select the curtains to match or contrast . They come in either black or brass . The brass curtain will darken and discolor if a burning log rolls against it , so the black is most practical in any but the most formal setting . The top bar comes in many finishes in either formal or informal styles , and a custom look is inexpensively achieved with the proper choice . Handsome fenders are also a nice addition for in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area without impeding the heat , while " fencing out " pets or children . Woodholders beside the hearth are convenient for fuel carriers in the winter and handsome holders of greenery which you will place within the firepit in the summer , with the curtains drawn to the side . They come in the same finishes as the screen and fenders , along with matching toolsets . Those of recent design are heirlooms in the making , they are so attractive . Consider how the fireplace looks both in use and not in use , for this is just as important . A handmade fan of metallic covered paper makes a handsome shield against that old black pit on summer days , too . Do you want a fireplace , but do n't want to have the expense of tearing up your home for an involved and messy installation ? Well , you can have one installed that is so easy to do it is called a " plug in " fireplace ! There are a number of designs available , from the old Franklin stove  | type to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are marvelously practical in any empty spot that is calling for a cheery fireplace . Even if you are inexperienced builder , you can install one of these easily in about eight man-hours . Directions come with them , but Ill mention a few details for starters . After you 've measured your space for the hearth and base ( an average of four feet square for a corner ) , remove this amount of vinyl or wood flooring to the sub-floor . Terrazzo concrete tiles cemented to the subfloor make a beautiful fireproof and easy-care hearth . There are other tiles which can be cemented right to a hardwood floor without cutting down to the sub-floor , if you wish . No joists , concrete base , or other method of under-the-house support is needed , because the free-standing fireplace is not heavy . The walls around it need not be changed , because the heat from behind the fireplace wo n't even warm them . A metal frame covers a square hole you 've cut in the ceiling . You frame the hole with a ceiling joist blocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimney . Then the fireplace is simply set in place like an appliance , to give you carefree hours of actual wood-burning , old-time fireside enjoyment , for a cost of a fraction of a built-in one . The fireplace is a natural center of interest , but care must be taken to avoid shutting out the rest of the room . Do n't let the ends of the room be meaningless appendages to your fireplace grouping . These can be made interesting in many ways by a desk and chair , a card table and chairs ready for use , a decorative console and mirror , or in a large room by a tea table and chairs for a tete-a-tete . The size and architecture of your room will govern the grouping of furniture . Whatever the requirements , however , be careful to make the arrangement natural and logical . Where convenience receives due consideration , beauty will more easily be achieved .  | " Deliver us from a clinical kitchen , " is the cry of the homemaker . And , thank goodness , fashions in home furnishings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stark , cold kitchen of the past into the more colorful surroundings of the rest of the home has made great strides with the additional colors being added to all of the functional components of this much-used room . We all love a warm , colorful , inviting , eat-in , live-in kitchen that 's pretty as well as practical . Surely , we do want rugged walls , floors , and work surfaces that will stand up with a minimum of care . . . and we can have them in a dazzling array of colorful materials . Appliances are no longer stark and sterile looking . They fit right in in a variety of soft colors , with warm gold and luscious avocado green added most recently to the copper and pastel tones first introduced on complete lines of major appliances from stove to washer . . . giving an excitement and warmth to the most streamlined room . Not to be outdone , dinette makers have designed many new styles , including ranch oak , perky modern , elegant traditionals , and Early American ; all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you are planning to change your cabinets , investigate the new ones , in which styling is available in Provincial white or fruitwood , oak , pecan , or walnut , which will provide a look of country charm or city sophistication , all in a plastic finish for easy upkeep . The pre-built ones are readily available and usually less expensive than custom-made ones . They come in many modular sizes which make it easy to install them without much , if any , adjustment for a tight fit in a given wall area . Matching wood paneling carries the idea along , with plastic or tile counter tops and flooring to blend or contrast in exciting hues and patterns .  | Wallpapers are more durable and their designs and colors more imaginative than ever , no matter what your decor preference . In fact , some designers refuse to call them wallpaper any more because they are much more permanent than our original concept of the term . Many of them are a boon to the novice hanger , with pre-pasted backing that makes hanging a cinch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entire cover-up or cut out and applied in a pattern of your own choosing on just a few of the door fronts . This will also minimize poorly arranged cabinetry in the older home . Clever ways of using wallpaper and paint will create decorative interest in the older kitchen if the time is not right for a complete structural change . Ideas run the gamut of creativity from traditional to high camp modern , so it 's no trick to change the character of your kitchen easily . Correcting problems by artful camouflage often creates a setting unmatched in those bought at much dearer cost . Spray your old metal or wood cabinets and enlarge a special motif taken from the wallpaper design for a carryover effect on the upper cabinet doors . Make a patterned valance over the windows and stencil the repeated pattern around the wall close to the ceiling for a coordinated look . Hand-painted window shades in the same or companionable design motif will carry the gay mood further . If you are not a free-hand artist , make a stencil of the design you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with little upkeep , while disguising the antiquated look you wish to eliminate . If you are the self-sufficient streamlined type , keep your motif geometric or cubistic . If you like a country kitchen look , use herbs or florals for the design and continue it with hanging pots and pans plus a string or two of the very realistic-looking onions available at the florist 's . Add a bouquet of flowers in your beanpot or soup tureen , using garden herbs for greenery . Sounds deliciously pretty , does n't it ?  | As we all know , the kitchen ( bathroom , too ) is the most difficult and costly room in your home to re-arrange , because , obviously , of the built-ins . The older ones , with their vast spaces and fewer wall-hung cabinets , can more easily be renovated charmingly than some only a few years of age . ( That is , other than antiquated plumbing and wiring , which is the province of the professional plumber and electrician . ) The kitchen that is poorly lighted is likely to give you one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working in your own shadow is to add pin-up lamps on either side of the sink to the protruding cabinets . If you can stretch the budget , you can eliminate glare completely all over the kitchen with a ceiling of luminous lighting panels . Adaptable to any ceiling , they throw soft light wherever needed , and are not too hard to install . One of the combinations I like best is the pebble white washable vinyl and fiberglas ceiling that includes a white steel grid that you can install within two inches from your present ceiling . It comes in easy-to-handle 2 ' by 4 ' multiples . You add panels for lighting on some of the grids and solid panels on others . Above them are fluorescent tubes in the required lengths . Another advantage of this type of ceiling is that it absorbs up to 60% of noise . When you are fortunate enough to be able to re-design your present kitchen , plan the new arrangement in a way to streamline it as much as possible . You should apply the same rules of arrangement as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns in mind . Route through-kitchen traffic away from the work centers . As for the routes you walk as you do your work , make them as short as possible between the most-used points . Plan enough counter and cabinet space ; with baking centers , salad and vegetable preparation spots , with chopping block counter tops convenient to the area of their next stage of preparation or use . Haphazard kitchens are physically exhausting . It is best  | to plan your new kitchen on paper first , with a floor plan drawn to scale , and cut-outs to represent appliances and tables and chairs , if these are to be utilized . The success of a kitchen depends on its cabinets , cupboards , drawers , and working surfaces , and their arrangement . If you would like to keep an image of the comfortable old-fashioned family kitchen but need extra storage and work areas , there are many free-standing china hutches and storage cabinets in a variety of sizes and finishes . Also , armoires originally designed for clothes can be converted into handsome china cupboards by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided below . If you are fortunate enough to find an old butcher 's table , it makes a grand chopping block and preparation table , centered under a hanging array of pots and pans . If one 's not available , many old oak tables are . Paint their legs in a gay color , and use the top in its natural unstained state ( taking off the old finish is easy , and then staining it with salad oil ) . Or you can tile it easily with mosaic tiles from your hobby shop or the four-inch ones from the building supplier . Updating the interiors of cupboards will make handier storage , and it does n't take too much ingenuity to do it . Heavy articles will be within easy reach on revolving shelves added in a corner cupboard . There are two-shelf units made for this , or you can make one yourself for single-layer tall things by using an old but sturdy lazy susan base . Root vegetables are safe and accessible in ventilated pull-out shelf bins . Pull-out utensil racks are available , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few screws . If you have a large , deep cupboard , take off its door and relocate the hinge placement at the bottom instead of at the sides , so it drops down like a front-loading dishwasher . ( Better use special heavy-duty hinges , usually called piano hinges . ) Then you can add baskets on little rollers to slide out your entire cache of supplies therein . If the space is high enough , you can make a double-decker by adding a length  | of curved molding the width of your rollers and about half way up . This serves as a track for them to move on . Vertical racks make handy storage for trays , platters , baking sheets , and cooling racks , utilizing a long narrow cupboard space often found next to a built-in oven . The divisions are made of V8-inch plywood . It is practical to curve the front of each division if you have a coping or saber-saw , just enough to give you knuckle room when you reach in for a utensil . Get rid of unneeded partitions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use as a bar , serving area , or stove or sink combination . Taking out part of a wall over a counter will often provide a passthrough to the next room for serving to a dining or family room area , or even outdoors to the patio . Sliding glass windows or folding shutter doors provide the enclosure when needed . If you have a narrow space between a new appliance and an old cupboard , even as small as four to six inches , you can make a sliding towel rack or knife holder for the larger cutlery items . A blank wall too small for a regular table can be made into a snack bar with a plank and heavy-duty wall brackets to support it . Keeps a lot of crumbs away from the rest of the house . On a wall even tinier , provide a gossip corner with a small shelf for the phone and a notepad . Use an old revolving piano stool for your seat . If you long for a separate eating area in the kitchen and have a breezeway between the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide an ideal space for serving breakfast , snacks , or tea . Floor-to-ceiling glass and a vinyl tile floor designed to look like pebbles combine to give you the feeling of indoor-outdoor decor . You can make it seem like a formal garden with a re-circulating fountain in one corner enhanced with a small statue . It can look like an informal flower bower with wrought iron plant stands in tiers to hold small pots of your favorite flower or herb . Cast iron or wrought aluminum furnishings complete the garden theme .  | The kitchen is the heart of the home . With the character of our kitchens changing from the cold , sterile , utilitarian room of old to one designed often without a wall to conceal it from the living and dining areas , it should be as bright , glamorous , and pretty as you can make it . Shall we dine ? If you 've tried to manage gracious entertaining from a kitchen or living room . If your children do n't consider meals as a very special time because that special place has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to bring the dining room back . Though it is set off from the living room by nothing more than a tall folding screen or movable room divider , dining deserves a real place of its own . A small dining room , or dining space , can perform like a big one when you include an extension table or a drop-leaf model . These can seat two or four for intimate dining , or up to 10 or 12 for a holiday feast . Or have you considered a fliptop permanent game table for that very tiny space ? They are only 32 inches closed , but flip open to 64 inches and are at home in any corner of a room . ( The top folds in half on concealed hinges . When you flip it open , it will slide to the center of its base as you lay it down flat ) . Larger stationarytopped game tables are also extremely fine for the larger room . They go up to 50 inches in diameter . No place for a library ? Using a hutch for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ambient solution to the " where to put it " problem , and makes for a warm friendly mealtime atmosphere among things you love . We know that a dining spot must often serve a different purpose at different times of the day , so the materials that are used form its character of formality or informality . Combining two activities in the room , such as part-time use for meals , and a study or game room at other times will justify its existence , if necessary , without a sacrifice of mood . Here one will feel the need of one of the wood-tone formica tops for hard wear , but which will be pretty enough for entertaining .  | Wall treatments contribute a great deal to the air of a room . Murals , moldings , lights , window treatments , floor coverings , and upholstery all set the style of the room . Table settings with an attractive cloth , plus good accessories on the table and any shelves , add the final touches of beauty . Color-scheme it for candlelight . . . even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room is probably most often seen under artificial light . Therefore , select colors under the kind of light most often used . Eating is a necessity , but dining is an art which deserves an attractive setting , whether served with formality or with casualness . . . be as relaxed as you like , but never careless . Adequate lighting in any room is very necessary both visually and esthetically . The right lighting can be a key factor in your decor , so let 's interrupt our tour of rooms to think about it . Because it is a light-shedder , the wrong lamp acts like a beacon , directing the eye to your mistakes . Make sure each light or lamp is in the correct place and is the correct height and style for a room , and that it has the correct reflectance for the job it is to do . The knowledge of what is meant by proper lighting is hard to explain . Technically , light can be measured only with scientific instruments . For many years various illuminating engineers have studied light and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A small light meter was developed years ago which measures luminosity in terms of foot candles . A foot candle is the unit of light that a pure white field receives from one candle placed one foot from it . In terms of this unit , definite light specifications have been recommended in combinations for achieving optimum results in the elimination of eye fatigue and strain plus the other needs of general illumination . General Electric residential lighting engineers have worked out some easy lighting recipes for the home . They recommend that you think of a " serving " of average eye heights and eye positions of the family ; the addition of the dimensions of most-used fur- nishings and equipment ; types and sizes of bulbs for that equipment . You then select an appropriate combination of " recipes " that best serve your family ; and flavor according to taste ( selection of styles and materials in accordance with personal taste and income ) . We 'll consider some of them without becoming too technical . No need to fret over exact proportions in these recipes . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " fill-in " lighting for most housekeeping activities . . . light for moving about and for softening pools of local light . For this , you will need ceiling fixtures , indirect light sources under cornices or in wall bracket types of lamps . There should be shadows in a room to rest the eye , as well as over-all lighting to create mood , but no strong contrast between the two . Warm light is a stimulus , just as warm colors are . . . cold light can change the entire mood of a room . In addition to general lighting , you need local or functional lighting for visual tasks and specific needs . This will include reading , games , desks , dining areas , spotlighting paintings , and such . This is provided usually in living areas by portable lamps close to the user , and in utility areas by permanent fixtures . Whenever possible , the local source should also contribute to general lighting , so a combination of both is desirable in a room . If portable lamps have open-topped , white-lined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and general . Consider portable lighting as a tool . How should our lighting recipes function with them ? To protect your eyes from glare and to save you from slouching to get below the shade , these recipes will protect your eyes from lamps that are too small , glaring , and yet give you warmth and radiance of the light source . They are based on average eye heights . The eye height of the average woman is 40 inches seated in a chair and 61 inches standing , while that of a man is 42 inches seated and 64 inches standing . The bottom edge of the shade of a table lamp should be approximately eye level when you are seated in a favorite chair . The bottom of a floor  | lamp shade is a bit above eye level because it sits back about ten inches behind the shoulder , near the rear corner of a chair . Should you like the other features of a floor lamp , and the lamp is too low for this recipe ( and the lower edge is not lower than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved forward in a table lamp position . Some of the lower ones have a small tray table attached to the stem to make them even more useful . The same idea goes for the taller table lamp . Because of its height , it will usually be larger in other proportions and be used on a larger table . . . so just compensate for its reflectances by moving it farther back on the table . The larger lamps usually have well-diffused bulb placement so that you receive no glare as you look past it . Consider portable lighting as a decorative asset . A welldesigned lamp slights neither its functional or decorative roll . It should look as well lit as unlit . It should be proportioned to its table and to the function of the piece of furniture it is closest to . Lampshades of light colors provide the best functional lighting , unless the lamp is very tall and the shade proportionally wide enough so that the illumination spreads in a wide area . Pale-colored shades look best in rooms with light walls , and those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paneling . Bright lights will make an interior seem larger , but soft lights and soft colors minimize environments and attract attention to the detail within it . Lamps should be decorative and add their measure of charm to an interior . However , they should be at the same time useful and correlated to their surroundings . A handsome lamp adds much interest to its setting and should be as large as the situation allows . Skimpy lamps can spoil an entire room . An artist paints with lights and shadows . Follow his rules and design your lighting to create an artistic balance of lights and shadows , warms and cools , in your room setting . Diversity is featured in lighting collections in the home furnishing world . There are lamps for every space and taste . The old Sunday School hymn says , " Brighten the corner  | where you are " . . . and that is what you can do with the proper choices . With these lighting elements present , we need to consider an adequate number of convenience receptacles for them . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one outlet is necessary for every ten to twelve linear feet of wall space . To determine what you need , measure the distance around the room , eliminate all openings that come to the floor , such as doors , windows , or fireplaces . Divide this total by 10 . The result will be the number of outlets necessary to give the room adequate service . Their location is usually centralized or symmetrically grouped in a certain wall area . This places potential lighting sources throughout the room . Television and phone outlets are usually grouped with at least one of the outlets each , and it is convenient for the re-arrangement of the furniture to have at least two on opposite sides of the room . Your bedroom and its adjacent bathroom are rooms you should treat as the most highly individual areas of your home , using all the charm , personality , and ingenuity at your command . A bedroom in particular , unlike most rooms in a home , does not have to please everyone . It is the one area of retreat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnishings that are completely different from the rest of the home or other bedrooms . There was a time , not so long ago , when these rooms were so uninteresting , unpretty , and utilitarian that they were best shut off and forgotten during the day , along with the heat in them . ( Remember when that was done ? ) No longer . . . the public is demanding , and getting , the high-fashion look it now wishes in bedroom furnishings  | and is carrying the style and color it desires right into bath fixtures and accessories . Beside the conventional pieces that one thinks of using , beds , chest , nightstands , we use many other pieces rather unusual in a bedroom . A quiet corner may use a small desk , or a combination desk and poudre ( powder ) table with a lift-up lid hiding the grooming essentials beneath ( a mirror is usually in the lid ) . The surface is otherwise flat for a writing area . A tea cart with a drawer and drop leaves can serve several purposes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or under the window serves another dual purpose of seating and a place for laying out clothes or the bedspread . A picture or bay window just calls for a chair or two with a small table within reach . It does n't have to be a fancy one . A round piece of plywood attached to hardware store legs , or to the top of any old nightstand makes a fine little table when covered with a floor-length skirt of chintz or felt . This makes a personal spot out of the mainstream of family activities that will provide the precious moments of privacy most people cherish in today 's busy-ness . When you think of bedrooms from that point of view , a question asserts itself , " Why not style bedrooms to serve both waking and sleeping hours ? " This is easy to do in some of the large bedrooms found in both old and new homes , ( We 'll get to those of less generous proportions in a moment ) . . . and big bedrooms whenever possible are gaining favor with modern families . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing the size of them , in order to satisfy the urge for multi-purpose usage . They often incorporate space for a sitting room , sewing area , or den , with a spot for television viewing and maybe even a home office . Most often the extra size is needed to accommodate the luxurious comfort of oversize beds . In either the king or queen sizes , there is just no substitute for the extra measure of comfort one gets from the increased square footage of the oversize mattress . For tall people , there is , in addition , a  | " long boy " mattress in a single , or twin , size . Some of you may not be familiar with this trend of longer or wider ( or both ) sizes in mattresses . They started in the West Coast , and while available nationally , may not have caught on so widely elsewhere . Because the average increase in American height since 1900 is at two inches and still going up , sooner or later the interest in bigger beds will be stronger everywhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1/4 " to 1 ' order that you can try them on your bedroom layout . A kingsize bed removes the need of the aisle that would be needed between twin beds , but extra length has to be considered . A queen-size is only six inches wider and five inches longer than a double bed . While larger bedrooms and oversize bedding reflect increasing size , comfort , luxury , and general affluence , neither is new . Social historians say that in the 1800 's the master bedroom of a middle-class household was an office from which the home was run . The lady of the house established her headquarters there , and usually decorated it without considering even her husband 's preferences ! Oversize beds date back even earlier . England 's famous " Bed of Ware , " made for King Edward IV , measured 18 feet 6 inches by 12 feet . In the 12th century an enormous bed was a medieval status symbol , and anybody who was anybody had an enormous bedstead for man , wife , children , guests , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply wish for more space in all bedrooms , and especially in the master bedroom , where parents can have a private living area if need be . . . or simply the enjoyment of the increased size of the room . Well , you 've considered these new sizes , did n't have room for a change , but still want something different in your decor ? Take an old Victorian sofa and attach side and foot rails between the arms where the seat used to be . Either cut out the front of the frame of the sofa or use it for added  | support under the frame and mattress , if it is n't too high . Add a box spring and mattress for a charming and most clever headboard effect . Add a boxed style bedspread over a gathered dust ruffle , attached behind the rails if you used those of wood . Roll your pillows bolster fashion when you make up the bed . Carry out the Victorian idea with candle sconces on the wall over the new bed , flowery curtains at the window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add to the charm of the period effect . This idea can be used in a small , low-ceilinged room by using a smaller pattern in the paper and spread . An old-fashioned , hard-to-decorate bedroom , with its high ceilings and hard-to-hide woodwork and doors can become a lovely haven of peace when treated the same way . Accent the dignity of the high ceilings with a drapery-simulated half-canopy behind the bed ( instead of the Victorian sofa-headboard ) , using curtain rods attached to the ceiling to carry the canopy effect , and side draperies to tie the canopy in with the bed . These latter would be at right angles with the wall behind the bed , in a single width , pleated in the regular way , or gathered in half their width if you prefer . Use a rather large pattern on the canopy in keeping with the desired period , and repeat it in the draperies and on down in the bedspread ( or throw if you are using a dust ruffle . The latter would be in a correlating plain fabric , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed in , too , for a little contrast . ) The window draperies will be the same pattern , with a matching valance over the high windows . Repeat the same in wallpaper for an over-all continuity of pattern which will serve to diminish the apparent proportions of the room . Woodwork and doors will match the dust ruffle . When this much pattern is not appealing , break it up effectively by painting the wall behind the bed in the same companionable plain color you have used elsewhere , drape the sides of the bed with the same effect as mentioned above , and add a concealed lighting strip under the canopy . Add a group of small prints over the bed .  | If a slanting dormer window is your problem , you can frame it with a drapery and matching valance , caught back with tie-backs . You can also use a length of ruffled curtain the width of the window and double the length of one side of the window ( all of a piece ) and catch it back at both sides of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each side where the slant of the window meets the lower wall . The average or small contemporary bedroom acquires a feeling of spaciousness when furnishings are scaled down in a sleek walnut finish , with a bright stripe on the spread , a slender lamp on the night stand , and the dash of a bright wall accessory behind the bed . If you wish for a canopy effect , use one of the wicker semi-canopy frames available at any of the import shops . It is free-standing , with sides and top of about 12 to 15 inches in width , and has a trellis effect . Paint it a pretty color ; also a companion chair in the Victorian wicker for a mod look without bulk . Of course , you do not use fabric on the canopy . These wicker pieces are very inexpensive , but your handy craftsmen can make a similar trellis idea with strips of lathe for crosspieces for even less and have the same idea . Trellis the top and sides of the window , going to the floor , and use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the latter are in Chapter XI . ) Many comforts and conveniences can be built into a small bedroom for space-saving function . On one small , a builtin headboard , counter , and storage unit can run almost its entire length . You can include a flip-top vanity in this unit at one side of the bed , and outlets along the length of the one-piece counter you will have . It 's then an easy reach from the bed to the electrical conveniences one needs nearby ; telephone , electric blanket , clock , etc. , plus a switch for the lighting in the soffit overhead that provides illumination in place of portable lamps . Much the same idea can be built under windows as well . Sliding doors on closets save the space that hinged doors would need to swing in , and also make possible the opening  | of an entire half of a closet at a time . The use of plate glass mirrored doors will add an additional dimension of space illusion to the room , double the brightness , and give you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to install in the same way as are regular sliding doors . When there is a need for added ventilation in a closet , and to add a traditional design element to the room , folding shutter doors are the answer . They need the width of one section only to fold away from the opening into the room . The remaining sections will stack against the first in the same width of space . More about these later . Guest rooms can be provided in a number of ways . The simplest is created by using a hide-a-bed sofa in a den-like atmosphere of dual-purpose use , incorporated into a television , sewing , or library room . A little more elaborate bedsitting room can be charmingly created by placing a pair of twin-sized beds end to end , pullman style , within an alcove made by a single dropped cornice board ( using a 1 ' x 8 " board with a molding at the bottom , fastened to the ceiling from wall to wall , 42 inches out from the wall ) with draperies hanging from rods concealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end wall , the other half tied back in the middle between the meeting ends of the beds . A plywood wall 40 inches out from the back wall separates the beds . You then wallpaper the walls and ceiling in the same pattern , and repeat in matching draperies . Make bolster covers for the pillows to serve as daytime cushions . Paint the cornice the color of the background of the paper . This nook creates cozy sofas or reading niches by day , private single beds at night . It also makes way for a considerable amount of space in the remainder of the room for other activities . Teen-agers nearing maturity are a mixture of child and adult , with the adult feeling more paramount . They need privacy as much or more than adults do , plus a sense of permanence and security . . . of belonging to their environment . They respond quickly to attractive surround- ings , and yet need practical surfaces and furnishings . Decorative fabrics for spreads , windows , and floors should be able to take plenty of wear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and storage space , and surfaces to hold collections and hobbies , plus a desk and book area . Recently , manufacturers and designers , in answer to popular demand , have developed ideas for the teen 's room to answer these needs . Some of them are modular cabinetry , shelves , and desks to give the built-in look . They are made in rugged oak or maple for the boys or dainty white Provincial for the feminine teen , and either can have plastic tops with no loss of looks . Prices range from moderate to expensive , depending on quality and amount of detail . If these are out of the question , there are many homegrown ways to achieve a similar look . Fortunately , in the teen-ager 's room , individuality and personal preference should be allowed to reign , making the sky the limit in " fixings . " Watch for a tendency , however , to go overboard in unique or far-out wall treatments of a permanent nature for this group . They change their likes and dislikes so frequently and often so violently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a complete paint or paper change . Bulletin boards are the answer , and a must in every teen room . Their backgrounds can be painted a gay , wild color , preferably one that will be repeated elsewhere in the room and relieved in the over-all background surfaces with quieter tones , more conducive to rest and study than too much bold pattern or widely used color . The built-in headboard storage idea is a great space saver here , too . Then all one needs is a box spring and mattress that can serve as a bed or lounging area . If built-ins are too costly , or you are renting , use two 32-inch high filling cabinets placed as far apart as space allows ; paint a favorite color and place a plank on them measuring the full length necessary to cover the cabinets . This makes a desk-storage area most easily . Or , adjustable plank shelving is inexpensively and easily attached to the walls with a minimum of screws , or on free-standing  | shelving strips . All of this can be carted off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same room , a corner bed arrangement is practical and space-saving . A pair of single beds is placed in an L-shaped formation in a corner , with a corner desk-table built like a knee-hole desk dividing them ; so that one bed can partially slip under it in the daytime . It serves as a night table for the two beds as well . Rooms for pre-teens seem to be the most often neglected of the family . . . for although most parents delight in a pretty nursery and most teens demand decent decor , this large group of in-betweeners usually have to put up with the cast-offs . We often feel they are not ready to appreciate decent furnishings . Actually , youngsters are at their most impressionable at this age , and their surroundings may well influence their taste for a lifetime . True , children do simply live differently , and their needs change as they grow , so we want to be flexible in our planning . First of all , a child needs a place to put things . The bounty of doting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toys and clutter for which storage must be found . These must be easy for them to dive into and simple for them to replace toys at pick-up time . The best solution to this , if you 're on a shoe-string at this point , is to glean some sturdy cardboard boxes from a furniture store , remove the lids , and paint them in bright colors with a quick swish of a dimestore spray can . So that they are not too mobile , connect them with some furring strips made into a simple frame at the bottom . Well-planned storage is a major concern . Some open shelves are convenient , but doors to hide others are an asset , as it is too much to expect a growing youngsters to keep everything shipshape . If your young one is at the early stage of youth , but recently graduated from the crib , add a decorative safety device which looks like a rounded picket fence for a headboard on his youth bed ; extend it as a guard not quite halfway the length of the bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at and is grown-up enough that the little one will not feel like  | a baby . Further its decorative appeal by stenciling or drawing free-hand flowers on the wall behind it . . . or use wall paper with a floral motif that peeks over the edge for a little girl and a humpty-dumpty for that rugged little boy 's motif . Repeat the design of your choice on a machine oil quality window shade . Many houses are built with a double closet in each bedroom . Pre-teens do n't have enough clothes to fill both , so remove the doors from one side and use it as a play alcove with a small table and shelves within . Lower the clothes rod on the other side to a height more convenient for them , and add movable shelves above for increased storage . Paint a flat sliding closet door in a hard enamel so it is washable enough to allow a child to draw on . With this being permissible , he will not vent his budding artistic trends on wallpaper or other less hardy surfaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is best provided with a trundle bed ( it can be built in ) with a pullout bed beneath . This gives needed space in the room when it 's not needed for play activities that would be lost with a larger bed . A trundle bed with a storage drawer beneath in place of the extra bed is another answer to the problem of where to put things . Another is the toy box with a padded lid for lounging as its top . I recommend the use of bright pastels . . . a lot of them . Controlled variety is appealing to the developing child , and leaves him free to develop personal color preferences usually not yet established in this age group . The brighter tones also minimize maintenance . Rather strong light is also needed . This room , although usually small , is the center of many pastimes , so that 's a definite asset . Art can be utilized as it is elsewhere in the home . . . but not " cute " pictures of the kind adults think children like . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collages or stitchery with a humorous theme , educational scenes or maps of familiar places , or toy collections of dolls or flags of many nations .  | What do you call that most lived-in room in your home ? A " den , " " rec " room , " rumpus room , " " keeping kitchen , " or honestly , just a catch-all room for all the leftover furniture from the rest of the house ? Certainly , you want a room for the family to relax in and enjoy ; so you want it casual and completely comfortable . It is the center of all the daily activities ; from the creative ones to the restful sessions with a good book , music , or television watching . . . so it has to take rugged usage and hard wear . Fine . . . we 're in agreement here . But that 's no reason for letting the whole decor sag out of shape with hand-me-downs . After all , this important room is where most families spend nearly all of their waking hours at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area in the home . . . not the last half-mile to the discard heap . How many people do you know with a family room , who lead you right through the living room , beautiful as it may be , on to the family room . . . many times apologizing for its looks while saying , " This is where we always end up . Honestly , we intend to refurnish it nicely one of these days . Right now , we 're using the things we have had and do n't know what to do with , so excuse the mess . " So they continue to struggle unhappily along with things as they are . There 's no incentive to improve any of it . Are you guilty yourself ? Look around . Does it make you so sad the second cup of coffee does n't even help your flagging spirits this morning ? It is not unrealistic to plan a handsome , informal , livable room where everyone is nonetheless welcome , down to the family pet . Several factors are dominant when planning a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Needs and interests of the family should also be considered . Location of the room will be a determining factor , and , of  | course , fabrics and surface coverings are very important , as well as sturdy construction of major pieces of furniture . First-floor family rooms have many advantages , especially where there are months of outdoor living to be enjoyed , as this makes the patio and yard a natural extension of the interior living center . With this type of room , furniture has to be arranged with consideration for the outdoor area and its easy access , along with interior space and traffic patterns to and fro . This usually means the necessity of easy access to and from the kitchen as another extension of both the family room and the outside eating area . With all of this eating and traffic here and there , ease of maintenance of walls and floors is a major consideration , which will be discussed in their own chapters in more detail . It can be said without fear of contradiction that we are no longer eating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or patio . Therefore , we must have fabrics that are completely scrubbable while looking handsome all the while . Here is where the vinyls come into their own . They are designed to look like leather , velvet , linen , or any texture you can name . They are made to " breathe " so that one does not feel clammy and damp after having sat against them on a warm day . They are supported on the back so that they will no longer crack when cold , and can be sewn , molded , or otherwise used in any situation where a pliable fabric is needed . Table and desk surfaces have their own practical and pretty surfaces . Another kind of vinyl has been made to look like leather , and there are plastics made to look like cultured marble , both of which are easy to apply to old surfaces . Slate , real and man-made , is impervious to stains . Glass . . . clear , sparkling glass helps to play space-making tricks in a small room when used alone as table tops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to protect and not hide . Be sure to get plate glass when possible , or at least some 1/-inch thick , minimum . It 's your best insurance against easy breakage .  | To add extra seating to a room , yet not let it seem filled up , include low stools in your furniture arrangement . They can be easily shifted about , as can ottomans and stack cushions . Coffee tables with pull-out snack tables or stools from beneath expand serving or seating arrangements to party size . An adjustable light pulled low over a coffee table provides dramatic lighting for things on the table , but leaves faces in restful shadows . It operates on a pulley so that it can be pushed high for general lighting or moved out of the way while dancing or playing games . Space is a precious commodity and rooms that can function for more than one purpose without overcrowding make sense . Leisure furniture should be simple . Concentrate on color , texture , and a few good accessories , and give special attention to sound construction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used for 90% of a family 's life at home should actually be of better construction than that even of the living room . Sagging springs or lumpy depressed foam cushions and tables bow-legged from hard use are not functional , comfortable , or presentable . You usually get what you pay for in inner construction , and will have a longer-lasting unit which can be recovered or refinished for many added years of use , if you choose wisely . Many of the cheaper varieties of advertised family-room furniture are not worth redoing , and one really loses money in total replacement . It is rather interesting to know that it was in the 1930 's that entertaining moved to the " rumpus room , " as it was first called ; and bright , even gaudy colors emphasized the atmosphere of gaiety going on there . The excitement of exotic , make-believe decorative accessories was used lavishly . Some are returning to this style presently and feeling it is very avant garde . However , there are many , who while sharing the family room with the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading , prefer somewhat muted wall colors or paneling , spiced with lively accents in smaller items that can be re-arranged for a change .  | One of the greatest changes in our way of living our leisure hours has been through the advent of what is best called " home entertainment sound equipment , and as spectators at the variety of offerings on the television tube . These have become such an important part of our life , we have had to incorporate them into our decorating scheme , and this has n't always been easy . Fortunately , the original bulk of these units has been reduced , and the cabinetry itself has been refined to the point that it is now a handsome piece of furniture with fewer limitations of placement . It is often difficult to maintain a center of interest in this all-purpose room . We have perhaps , the picture window or window-wall to the patio to consider . There may be a fireplace in the room ( what nicer place for it to be ? ) , and the ever-present TV set . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a common focal point , requiring only slight movement to shift attention or seating . Combination of two centers of interest makes it easier to plan seating , or comfortable , workable furniture arrangements . A built-in television is just about the most convenient idea I know . It can be placed in the corner of a group of low-hung wall cabinets ( always allowing for air space around it . . . over-heating can cause a fire ) , or it can be used in high wallhung cabinets for viewing from farther across the room . It can be placed next to the fireplace and worked into the book shelves there . If your most pleasant viewing wall happens to be on the same wall as a closet , pantry , or the garage , it is easy to cut a hole into the wall and build a supported shelf behind the wall to hold the set , where easy removal for maintenance is a cinch . Often it can permit a change of tubes from behind without moving at all . If you wish to hide it when not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the wall or cabinets will do the trick . If your set shares a common viewing area between two rooms , you can get casters or swivels  | to add to its feet , or on a lazy susan-type tray under it if it 's a table model . It 's easier to swing it on these than to shift the rest of the furniture . More Americans are reading . They like to spend this leisure time listening to music as well . Music is also high on the required list for enjoyment at parties . This means we acquire more records and demand more complex sound systems . . . but we do not forget good room design . Therefore , stereo turntables , tape decks , recording equipment have to be housed in good-looking units in styles to blend with the rest of the room . They are available in lowboy credenzas of various lengths , small console cabinets of handsome mien . Old country desks and massive armoires conceal sound equipment , and there are wall-hung units which serve to keep music high and handsome in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a swing-out turntable and tuner in elegant styling , and serve a dual purpose for a small room . There is even an old harpsichord replica which contains radio and stereo equipment . All these , plus the built-in ideas already mentioned , plan on no real limits in the well-dressed , musically-oriented home ; and the family room or living room do not always have to be the location for them . A small stereo console in the entry hall serves another dual purpose for us . If your family room is upstairs , and you therefore have no choice about sharing the indoor-outdoor scene , your center of interest will lie in some other aspect . You are fortunate indeed if that is a fireplace . You can change its cozy winter-time view to that of a spring grotto by adding a rock garden effect with various sizes of rocks and potted plants setting inside the firepit . Add one fairly tall one on the hearth too , to bring it gently into focus with the room . No family room , but you have a basement ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prime space that can be developed into any kind of room you want , from rough-and-tumble play areas for the kids to a room for visitors . This is a great place for . a  | hobby center , music corner , book nook , or an all-around rec room for all the family . This idea is not new , of course . Back in the forties , this was the site of many of the original family rooms . Developing the area successfully takes a bit of doing , however . The secret of this is to design it to look as un-basement-like as possible . No one wants to feel like a mushroom . The ceiling and the lighting are usually the important features to consider , assuming that the place is waterproof ( a major consideration best left to local experts who know what conditions they are dealing with ) . Warmth , texture , and light-reflecting capability are three more important factors . Since they are often low in these below-grade rooms , pattern or texture overhead should be minimized , but a warm color in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grid system of lighting is practical if the ceilings are high enough . If they are 16w , use indirect lighting under valance boards around the room . Placed on a rheostat , it can be turned high or low in intensity . Paneling is the quickest way to cover walls handsomely , and is carried around to any partitions that need be added . Make your own windows unless you have a daylight basement . If you are artistic , paint trompe l'oeil ( deceive the eye ) scenes and surround them with a regular window frame . Use mural wallpaper if you doubt your own artistry , or large posters of foreign scenes . Or put up a curtain and valance rod and make draperies which are always pulled shut just as though they were covering a real window . Brightly painted sliding doors conceal any built-in you may have thought of ( washer , etc . ) Hard floor surfaces will depend on the amount of dampness present . Better check with your local experts on this , as some flooring materials stick better to cement than others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapter IX . ) The use of artificial plants in pots will add a touch of needed outdoors greenery , but real ones will not grow well in total artificial light . You could even paint a tree on one wall and attach artificial flowers or fruit to it , with a bird or two .  | Whether you have a daylight basement or a first-floor family room that opens outdoors , the garden becomes a part of the house , so furnishing the patio or porch ( or atrium , if you have one of those within your walls ) becomes an important part of the interior concept of the home in areas where weather permits . There are hosts of new " indoor-outdoor " floor coverings , handsomely styled " leaveout " furniture , dramatic garden lighting , gas heaters , and barbeques to make the garden part of the house . . . and a view from your picture window when wide-open vistas of mountain or shore are not present . If you are not fortunate enough to live in this type of climate , doublepaned glass windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or floor furnaces in an enclosed garden room will give you nearly the same effect year around , and total control of your living environment . The construction of such a room often costs little more than a good vacation away from home ; and money spent in this way can give you a restful feeling all year without traveling a mile . If you have a summer retreat , you may want to brighten it up with a few simple decorating ideas . Veterans of vacations spent in second homes near beach or mountain can testify to the need for some decorative ingenuity in them . A few bright and inexpensive household touches will give your place a new lease on the good summer life . Dish gardens of easily grown green plants will help bring some of that glorious outdoors indoors . Place them in a planting medium in an old salad bowl or bean pot . Plant some herbs if you are an inveterate gourmet cook . Their fragrance is worth a thoughtful watering now and then . Some of the sedum family , like the " hen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few wet pebbles in a dish , and a sweet potato makes the loveliest vine in a pitcher or vase , with just part of it resting in water . You need the brightest colors possible for accents against the green of the forest or blue of the lake or ocean , so throw  | lots of pillows on the lounge , perhaps to emphasize the color you 've added to the front door . Add some fluffy giant ball fringe to the lamp shades ( if they are tired looking hand-me-downs from your town house , they may also need a burlap slipcover . ) Repeat the fringe on the table cloth or window coverings . I hope you have lots of giant floor pillows for extra guests to sit on , and the " regulars " to sprawl on . Sleeper-sofas , bunks , or trundle beds are the answer to comfort in both day and night accommodations . Choose colors different from those you use at home , so you wo n't tire of either one . This is a good time to try out a color you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , summer is a time for adventure !  | Space is always a large consideration in any home . You pay for space whether you have a house or an apartment , and whatever you pay , you seldom seem to have enough roomy return for your dollar . Many people express the wistful desire for very large rooms . . . others are lost in a great space . Lack of space can be a real decorating problem , and too much space can be equally as challenging . Somewhere between too much and too little there is a solution , and there are fascinating ways to solve the problem . The question of " what to do with a bare spot in a room " continually arises between client and interior designer . In many instances , the answer is " nothing " . . . the space may be necessary to balance busy areas elsewhere in the room . If there is a void which is dull and uncalled for , then something must be added . It is for this reason that we shall consider occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . The term " occasional piece " is a general term for a small item of furniture that may have one or several purposes , adding to the comfort and convenience of a room in small spaces . It is usually functional as well as decorative ; therefore set apart from a mere accessory . Space is incorporated in the over-all design of a room . It is inherent in the composition ( arrangement ) we have organized from the variety of shapes and sizes of things we have used ; their area , form , and distribution . In creating a work of art , we would say it means weighing the masses and spaces and arranging and balancing them into a pattern that would be interesting and beautiful because of these varieties ( area , form , etc . ) . It is the same with a room . We have considered in previous chapters how to choose  | and to arrange some of our room components into an orderly result . Space is such a vital part of the decorating elements of arrangement , balance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it separately in order to give it its proper due . It would be valuable for you to return to Chapter II and review that part on apparent proportions and the illusions of space relationships . The element of extremes should not be present in a room . That is , very narrow spaces should not be used with broad or wide spaces . The area of an item of furniture should be in relation to the area of space on either side of it . Duplication of the amount of space allowed is equally as bad as the extremes because it creates a monotonous effect . Good proportion of space , as good proportion within the furniture pieces themselves , means the happy medium that will make them acceptable to your view . Some space should accent dynamic design for interest . There should be static areas to lend a sense of rest and quiet , and to refresh our eye before it travels on to the next area of interest . Color has its part in space , as it creates form . It also creates the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors we use , their transitions , hue , and harmonies , can make space relationships ( such as furniture against walls , walls against an exterior view through a window , draperies against walls , walls against ceilings , carpet against furnishings and walls , etc. ) pleasing or discordant . Transitions that are harmonious and well-balanced are like music or poetry . They are intangible in their reaction on us , whether it will be a sensuous appeal or an instinctive rejection because they offend . Color , therefore , is an all-powerful tool in creating space , form , and the illusion of space relationships . It can " make or break " a setting . It has been said that nothing depresses the soul so much as perfect symmetry . Symmetry is static , variety is dynamic . Usually , an asymmetrical arrangement of objects incorpo- rates a balance between the object , or objects , used , on the one hand and a varying amount of space on the other . Without this space , the arrangement could not be accomplished . It could not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architecture and art . If we can view the decorative composition of our room as a study in proportion , we shall have gained the insights we need to complete it properly . And we shall see the need for both empty spaces here and there , and the best use of the rest of spaces we shall fill elsewhere . Interior design is the expressive putting together of parts into a beautiful , functional whole , and not just the individual parts or pieces of a room themselves . Space is included here as a part of it , along with the solid masses or areas ( furnishings , fireplaces , etc . ) . There are special considerations of space in the small room . We have discussed a few of them previously . Let 's think of others . One can provide both comfort and convenience in small areas if one can restrain oneself from overdecorating the under-designed room . To make a tiny room look larger is a big order . To make it live larger is an even bigger one . We must really juggle our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fit them into a smaller one . High on the benefit list are built-ins and storage units , if we are to make every inch count . We must be becoming better organized homemakers , acquiring more possessions , and yet making better use of the allotted and limited amount of space we 're obliged to utilize . One of the reasons is that designers of furniture storage pieces are making them more beautiful , more functional , and more readily available for every room in the home . We need storage for books , linens , dinnerware , and clothing , plus the endless list of accessories and household items dear to our hearts and essential to today 's homemaking . Many of us are rigidly limited by lack of storage in the proper places , and if we have storage a-plenty , it is often too far away from the spot where it can be conveniently used .  | Sure , we have cupboards in kitchens , a linen closet in the hall , bedroom closets for hanging clothing , but we often find these bursting at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . and especially so when you have perhaps moved from a well-designed home to one with less space and minuscule built-ins . Two-way furniture pieces are really space stretchers . These are single pieces of furniture which perform one or more functions within a limited area . The list is long and easily adaptable to the individual need . There are space-organizing chests for every room and purpose , and some of them are interchangeable between entirely different rooms . These are sublime when they eliminate hunting for things in a jammedup place and trotting them many steps away to the place of their use . Cunningly designed storage units of table height can be found in handsome chests used in bedrooms for shirts , sweaters , purses , etc. ( and particularly dual-functional between twin beds ) ; or in the dining area for table linens , aprons , and such . They can double as an end table beside a sofa or chair in the living room and hold games , stamp collections , or extra ashtrays . Credenzas with drawers in the center , often having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shelf storage for large objects such as tureens , vases , and centerpieces , make setting the table easy . They are just as handsome in the living room and can house stereo components with aplomb . When there is need for a lamp table between two chairs but an ordinary one will overcrowd the situation , a wall console with the front slanted forward in a triangular design will be just right . They are built as small as 30 inches wide and with a depth of only 12 inches deep at the center , tapering to as little as 5 inches at each end . They have a nice amount of storage space within and room on top for a torchere lamp or hurricane style with glass globe and base . The shape of the piece lets one slant the chairs a bit toward each other , further conserving traffic space around them .  | The list of space organizers is endless , and since our philosophy seems to be that of making every inch count , the functional ones can be built in or set on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you when you move ) . . . but each one can do double duty if we wish it to . There are decorative chests that open to reveal bottle and glass storage where you have no room for a bar . There 's even a small refrigerator with an exterior of plasticized walnut veneer which looks like a small chest or filing cabinet . The interesting molding on one style of buffet is actually a drawer for leaf storage ( there 's never the right place for storing these , it seems ) . If the space under a window is your problem , few things are more dramatic than a lowboy with drawers , and some of them are beautiful . Place a tall lamp or vase on one end and a cushion or low accessory on the other . . . or a portable TV if need be . An entirely new area of use will be added , and yet the room will not be overcrowded . You will have the plus value of storage in these pieces plus a decorative addition of light proportions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very blank wall right where traffic flow eliminates large furniture , add a low bench or a coffee table. * Then hang a large mirror above it and coming down close to it ( no more than 10 to 12 inches above ) , with the most interesting frame you can find . Place a tall vase of greenery or flowering branches in season on one end , with magazines on the other . This creates a lot of interest in the erstwhile blank space , and the mirror will serve to enlarge the apparent space illusion of the room . In a space as narrow as 18 inches deep and any amount long up to about 40 inches , a teacart of modest size can serve as a console . Wheels give it mobility , and storage beneath is usually generous . An added value on some is the end pieces which open up on sturdy supports to make a larger buffet serving area .  | If the space you have is too small for an occasional piece or a chair , and yet needs something to soften the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a draping plant on it . Hang a group of small prints vertically and place them from very low to just above eye level . ( This is good in an area where room behind an opening door has to be dealt with , or between two doors where a narrow space is found . ) The use of a pedestal has long been favored for any object which is loved or valued . The ancients started the whole idea off by raising anything to be given respect . We have carried this out over the centuries by placing speakers , music conductors , and performers on a stage . Then it was decided that objects of art deserve the same treatment , so that every line of their form could be seen easily and therefore appreciated more . The Greek column was cut down to a pedestal for showing fine pieces of sculpture . The Romans thought the idea fine enough to use also . We can find copies of these in smaller scale in decorator and garden shops for just the right spot in the home . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Japanese have their " tokonoma . " This is a platform alcove in which they elevate a choice art object , a special flower arrangement , a scroll , or a bonzai tree , to lift it from the place of the ordinary to that of the special . Usually the custom is to display one featured item at a time in this place of honor so that it may be enjoyed to the fullest extent of the senses with no distraction from other focal points in the room . With the proper back-lighting and the subordination of other elements , this becomes a space of great beauty and tranquility in a room . The Chinese feel that the taller the elevation of an art object , the greater the homage , and so they use pedestals , tables , or platforms in varying degrees . They also raise most of their centerpieces , no matter how small , a trifle , to give a three-dimensional feeling to an otherwise flat plane . All of  | this must be in proper scale . . . the scale of stand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place on which they are setting and to the rest of the room . We would do well to observe that in all Oriental art , the stand or pedestal never distracts ; the color is never brighter ; nor the finish more interesting than that which it supports . They believe so strongly in harmony and unity that many stands are made to match or enhance individual pieces by the repeat of a motif or a curved line so that the two parts blend as one complete unit of artistic design . And as well , if a scroll with a chrysanthemum drawn on it is used , they would place a live chrysanthemum below it in a vase set in a position to enhance both . If a sculpture is used which has carving on it somewhere in a naturalistic motif , they would set a plant with the same curving lines below it , and let some of the branches flow up to reach for the sculpture , but not to intrude upon nor overpower it . It is said that Chinese humility also bows to the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lesser to the more important , but always working in harmony . Space in Oriental design is never over-full . Where it is empty , there is a reason . In our homes , a colorful mat may easily substitute for the emphasis rather than a pedestal . . . or a piece of glass , a chunk of polished wood or cork , or even a piece of decorative paper . There are no limits to the possibilities you can think up from simple materials around you . Even using a group of differently shaped pedestals themselves ( or candlesticks or vases ) , arranged in a given space , makes an interesting harmony , and looks so much more important than one alone . This is decorative organization of space ! Do think about the principles of design which the Orientals use , and use them also in your total room design . No matter what style of furnishings you use , these concepts will handle them pleasantly . Do n't let a little lack of wall space keep you from enjoying function and interesting additions to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or at least the illusion of a  | wall , by dividers of many types as well as with pieces of furniture . Do you want to escape from too much " togetherness ? " Retreat to your own private spot behind a wall created by folding wood doors . These can separate a bedroom into two separate study areas for the children . They can shut off the bustle of dinner preparation or clean-up between the kitchen and family room , or between the dining end and activity area of the family room . These can be solid or louvred . You can create a foyer with only four inches of space , or less . If your entry door opens right into the living room , construct a waist-high counter of glass or screen block as a buffer for wintry breezes without loss of light . Add space for decorative use by running shelves for plants and art objects to the ceiling above it . Even less space is used with the many designs of hardboard panels cut in varying patterns . These are easily installed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add a distinctive entry hall feeling without any loss of space , provided they are painted in a value not too much deeper than the room . You want the transition to be gentle , not abrupt , or the apparent space will be cut , not enhanced . A see-through concept having no weight at all can be achieved by the use of decorative glass or wooden beads of various colors and designs . These hang from their own small brass rod which is attached to the ceiling with a couple of screws . Exciting variations of color and design can be accomplished with these and have the plus value of no upkeep . The same idea can be worked out with wooden poles , plain or turned to many styles , but these are a more permanent installation again , and more costly . If you are a connoisseur of tropical fish , you have the makings of the most individual divider of all . A solid base of wood supporting the tank and holding the wall switch and plug in for heaters and light puts a living wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fullest while serving its function well . If a less permanent division of space is desired , there are the several styles of room-dividing screens stabilized with movable extension poles from floor to ceiling . . . very sturdy , but easily moved if desired , and much less costly . You will recall I mentioned them in an earlier chapter . You do n't need a solid wall for a piano or organ , and one of these can serve as a room divider in a large room , or create an entry hall feeling when placed at right angles to the wall next to the front door . Many decorative backs are available for them at music stores which sell the instruments . Others can be added in a variety of materials , as long as you leave some ventilation space at the tops of organs . Shutters work well , and can be stained to match the wood of the instrument , or painted a color to contrast or blend with the room . If the room is very long , you can add a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to the back of the organ only , giving a wider wall area at the side of the organ or piano large enough for a music storage chest , or a " listening " chair . If the room is wide enough to handle it , one can add book shelves back to back with the instrument as storage space for books , objet d'art , and hobbies . Just be sure the bookcase back ( if you use a backing ) is of pegboard to allow a smooth flow of air to the electronic system it 's attached to . Brightly colored burlap attached to the back with picture frame molding or decorative upholstery tacks can hold lightweight accessories . In a large area , you may want to place it at right angles to the wall for the purpose of breaking a traffic pattern , and to divide the room to break up furniture placements . In this case , use a love seat or refectory table back to back with it . There are many portable folding screens for use in as many different places . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blank corner , block off an unused door , old radiator , or to break up two diverse room settings ; such as a dining room group at the end of a living room setting . A versatile home- made screen can be constructed from 314 " fir plywood and double-acting hinges . Finish the edges with a flat banding , and then add designs to suit its setting . Use it plain for displaying small prints or cut out paper appliques , with only a coat of paint to provide a nice background color . Paint one side dark and the other side a lighter contrasting color , adding a studding of brass nailheads to simulate a paneled door . Use on either side of a too-narrow window instead of drapery panels ( with sheer curtains on the window itself ) ; and paint it a handsome coordinating color to show it off . Blend it with the wall by adding a criss-cross design of small half-round molding and paint this the color of the wall as a contrast to its main background color . Panel it with wallpaper outlined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for a traditional decor . Establish an Oriental mood by painting the panels in a subtle range of earth colors from dark to light then back to medium dark . ( For instance , dark warm brown , medium earthy beige , light bamboo , a warm gold , then burnt sienna ) . Once you have the screen made , you can change it whenever the newest idea hits you , with very little ado . Aside from " creating walls , " space can also be utilized on existing walls where a narrow unused spatial area is involved . If you have a wall only 40 inches wide between a door and a corner , and there is at least 12 inches depth available , a compact storage area can be built . Shutter doors from floor to ceiling may cover the shelves for a closed multipurpose cabinet in any room where the space and storage is available and needed . If you have an empty corner in a bedroom , large bath , or an entry hall , but lack closet space ; do a gay modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaster of parisfilled wicker , urn-shaped basket ( or any old high urn or Mexican water jug that will support the height and weight of the branch ) . Paint it a bright color and hang your hats , scarves , chain belts , and such on the branches . It 's stunning . Your small fry may want smaller copies for hanging up their coats and scarves , too .  | Some houses have a gem of a spatial area to decorate . The bay window , once a charming aspect of old houses , was very nearly lost in the evolution of compact home design . It is now being re-incorporated in modified scale to some lovely contemporary plans , and its uses are still as varied and practical as ever . For one thing , it adds an architectural interest outside , and increased floor space within . Here we find a space for a sofa , or perhaps two extra chairs with a lovely low table between . If the chairs are on castors or swivels , so much the better for an inside-outside orientation . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window-wall idea halfway . . . it projects you beyond the other walls for a feeling of being part of the outside , while keeping the furnishings within it from view . It is also a prime spot for a built-in window seating arrangement to augment your seating capacity elsewhere . This is especially fine where a view window is opposite the fireplace . . . for it can provide seating in touch with the outdoors without having to turn its back on the fireplace ; thereby destroying one good focus for arranging furniture in the room . A corner window can be treated with the same built-in seating to create a similar niche with no loss of space such as one would have from conventional furniture in the same setting . Some rooms , unfortunately , have no structural elements to work with in creating a pleasant and livable space . . . and no room to add any structural innovations without over-crowding the room even more . Decorative restraint and placement of emphasis where it is needed is even more valuable in this type of room . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trapped feeling if you must dodge pieces of furniture or built-ins during the normal course of your day . You must streamline your decor in every way possible if you are to function happily in it . Space must also be controlled in a large room , but in dif- ferent ways . Since people tend to congregate into groups anyway , it is foolish to think that a large room should be treated as one area . It is much better to organize space into furniture groupings . Place large items away from the walls , and add floor-to-ceiling bookcases behind them . Divide the very large room into more intimate centers of interest with a room dividing device of some sort . You can add a screen or a planter if you like , but you do n't need a regular divider to separate different-purpose parts of a room . Furniture will do the trick . Start your definition with a sofa as the main anchor for the grouping , frame it with two chairs ; all placed on a thick area rug . Balance the colors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you have a large window-wall that opens a great part of the way , you wo n't want to place furniture close to it , so use the same placement as was suggested for the bookcase behind the sofa . If you have beautiful floors in this room , an area rug will emphasis them while containing the grouping it frames . Group seating pieces around the heart of a room , no matter what its size . This is often the hearth . Place sofas or chairs at right angles to the fireplace . Directly opposite , place another sofa grouping . If your room is too narrow for such a second hearth oriented group , substitute a shallow bench , a chest , television , or breakfront . Extra seating can be placed in the corners behind the first pair of sofas for reading or chatting . If the room does not have an architectural focal point such as the fireplace , view-window , a wood-paneled or brick wall , create one of your own . . . a personal interest wall . On stained wood boards ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keyhole strips and brackets , display your books , small paintings , sculpture , handicrafts , or a collection of decorative glass , maps , or plants . Add a radio , phonograph , or television . Then arrange your seating around them for listening or viewing pleasure . The secret of success is the controlled organization of diverse settings . If you do n't have it , the room will be a  | hodge-podge of unrelated furniture pieces , not the attractive , livable setting you want . Lucky the homeowner whose living room has two architectural features . . . a fireplace and a view-window . You can take advantage of both by changing the furniture placement with the seasons . For spring and summer , set the sofas at right angles to the window to soak up the verdant view . Service them with one ample coffee table . Come fall and winter , turn to the fireside , with the sofas at right angles to the hearth wall again , a chair for reading beside the lamp table , and a low piece for storage in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the coffee table , if you prefer not to have it in front of the hearth . It should be large enough to hold its own here . Remember that wall-clinging seats can spell death to good talk . Seating pieces placed away from walls and toward one another make for easy conversation , uninterrupted by passers-by . You are also erasing that " meeting room " look of lined-up seating pieces ; another advantage of a larger room . If your personality resents a room that 's ordinary , or you want to relieve the overwhelming space of a very large room , try different changes of furniture placement . It 's not what you have , but how you use it that makes the difference . Place a long table or desk back to back with the sofa . Put a handsome high-back chair on its long side . Place magazines and a handsome vase , figurine , or lamp on the surface , thus creating a three-dimensional aspect which looks good from any angle . If you have an unbroken bookcase or window wall , extend a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , add an easy chair to the side opposite that of the desk chair . The desk lamp will be useful to both . Sometimes we have to create the illusion of width when a single item looks out of place and the scale is wrong . This can happen when a fireplace has been built too small and narrow for its wall length and you ca n't afford to reconstruct it . It may be that you have a lovely old antique cabinet , ser- ver , tier table , or some other unusual small chest that 's not antique , but very handsome , that you want to use , but its weight and size make it seem out of place in a large wall space . Do n't despair ! A composition can come to your rescue , and a few tricks will make the piece look more important . In the case of a server or tier table or any piece that 's somewhat low , you may use a pair of small arm chairs to flank it , with pictures hung in horizontal rows above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly scaled in subject matter and in frames . A collection of prints based on a simple theme and framed in uniform matting and frames works best . Over average-sized pieces of furniture in this category , two 9 x 12 " ( over-all size , including frame ) prints would be placed just above the furniture Item , with two more of identical size placed directly above , with a space of about two inches between the top of one series of frames and the bottom of those above . The outside of the frames should be set in from the edge of the server or whatever it is , about 1% to 2 " . Center two more in the same vertical placement above each chair , at the same height top and bottom . A small china-cabinet or any other piece of furniture that is rather tall , but narrow in width , would inhibit conversation from a pair of easy chairs as used above , although a pair of dining chairs could be set in their place if the item happens to be near the dining area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) would be a pair of plant stands placed on either side of it . If it is an antique cabinet where you display old plates and such , you may carry some of them up on the wall over it in the brackets made for plate display , making a very meaningful setting . If the furniture piece is Modern or Old World , t here are other floor-standing pieces you could substitute in the style they demand . . . tall , heavy candlesticks from Spain , statuary on Italian pedestals , or wrought iron or ' See sketch
