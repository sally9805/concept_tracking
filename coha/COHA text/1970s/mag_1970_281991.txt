TO one of its early foreign admirers , Brasilia was " madness-but heroic madness . " For most of its short history , the ultramodern inland capital has lived up to only the first part of that billing . When it was inaugurated in 1960 , after four years of feverish effort and the expenditure of some $600 million , Brasilia 's malls were pools of red mud , its streets were unpaved , and its new Senate did not even have seats . Only 20 of the country 's 326 federal Deputies took up residence , and no sooner had the dedication ceremonies ended than virtually every official with the price of a plane ticket flew right back to the familiar comforts of Rio , 600 miles away . <P> Ten years later , the capital in the wilderness still needs a heroic effort to become a success . A respectable 60% of the federal Deputies now live in town , and Brasilia 's population of 500,000 makes it Brazil 's tenth-largest city . But many recalcitrant bureaucrats continue to ignore the lofty imperative of former President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We must march to the west , turn our backs to the sea , and stop staring at the ocean - as if thinking of departing . " <P> Frontier Flavor . What Kubitschek could not achieve by evangelism , Brazil 's military regime seems determined to accomplish by edict . In marking the tenth anniversary of the capital last month , President Emilio Garrastazu Medici decreed that Cabinet Ministers must henceforth conduct their business only in Brasilia . The Rio-based foreign diplomatic colony will have to follow suit by 1972 . The move does offer one compensation to diplomats , though : Brasilia , with its limited escape routes , should discourage political kidnapings . <P> The youngest of a mere handful of world capitals that have been designed and built from scratch ( Pakistan 's Islamabad is still unfinished ) , Brasilia was intended to be much more than Brazil 's seat of government . Kubitschek envisioned it as the hub of a 5,000-mile highway network that would open the vast interior and draw people away from the coastal cities where , he complained , Brazilians " cling like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stripped of his political rights after a military junta seized control in 1964 , but his visionary aims are taking shape . Thousands of peasants have flocked to the " satellite cities " that spread out from Brasilia to a distance of 25 miles . Trucks rumble along the 1,350-mile Belem-Brasilia highway , spawning hundreds of roadside settlements , some of them with a distinct frontier flavor . At one hamlet , appropriately called Piza no Freio ( Hit the Brake ) , the only permanent residents are a madam and her four girls .
