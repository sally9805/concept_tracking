DEAR SIRS : George Woodcock 's " The Evergreen Maple Leaf " ( The Nation , Oct. 1 ) may have been disappointing only because I expect , Canadians to have a better grasp 01 the concept of being citizens of the world . What does it matter what one calls Who 's Who ? . . . The important thing is not that Americans are exploiting Canada 's resources4 So are rich Canadians . And rich Americans are exploiting the States . If it were not for greedy Canadians willing to sell their beautiful country to the highest bidder there would be no problem . Witness : the Montana rancher who refuses to sell his land to exploiters of any nationality . After serving in both the Canadian and American Armies , I can assure Mr. Woodcock there is no real difference between , us . Any one who tries to puff up nationalism for any nation is planting a seed of destruction , as the new African and Asian nations are proving so tragically . The difference is not between Canadian and American but between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . William M. Wilkerson prophet 's honor Los Angeles , Calif . DEAR SIRS : Edward McConville 's " The Prophetic Voice of C.P. Ellis " ( The Nation , Oct. 15 ) is a deeply moving biographical article of a man enduring the torments of socio-economic changes which portends the possibility of grass-roots black and white unity in the Smith . . . . The article also reveals the sensitive insight of the author . I hope he has a book forthcoming on C.P. Ellis and Ann Atwater . We need such positive publications on social change in face of the Nixon-Agnew-Watergate morbid effect on our democratic processes . Mark Keats Roslyn Heights N.Y . DEAR SIRS : In thirty-five years of regularly reading The Nation , I rank Edward McConville 's article as one of the most remarkable pieces you have ever published . Ellis gives hope that a recognition of mutual economic interests between the races may break barriers that neither the Bill of Rights nor ) ordinary human decency has been able to eliminate . K.J. Rawson still flourishing New York City DEAR SIRS : When in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trials against politicians , soldiers , journalists , writers , et al. , indicted for war crimes and crimes against humanity , I did my work , though I knew death sentences are inhuman , because I believed that the horrors of the Nazi era were unprecedented in history and I hoped , after the culprits got their punishment , that legal executions could be outlawed everywhere . Since those years I have written much about the crimes of fascism , Nazism , anti-Semitism , but I am not sure any more that those crimes were unique . Genocide was and is still flourishing ? Indochina , Indonesia , Algeria , Madagascar , Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia , Brazil  --  and the many dictatorships in four continents are , though not yet as efficient yet morally no better , than was national socialism . In one respect  --  as I wrote once in The New York Times  --  most of them are perhaps even worse : Hitler was more frank ; he did not pretend to defend the " free world " and serve peace . And now when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paraguay , I must say that Nazi politicians and propagandists were less hypocritical than those in the United States . The latter and their journals are so preoccupied with the fate of Soviet dissidents ( who are not killed any more ) that they have no time to deplore and decry the massacres in Chile , Paraguay , Guatemala , Brazil and elsewhere . . . . Robert Major EDITORIALS Nixon 's Wheel Horse Once again President Nixon has placed his immediate personal political interests above the welfare of the nation . Aside from experience in the House as a Republican wheel horse , Gerald Ford has none of the qualifications which the people have a right to look for in a man who just might succeed to the Presidency . The name of Gerald Ford is not a household word , nor was that of Spiro T. Agnew . Both were selected by Nixon for the second highest office in the land for reasons wholly unrelated to their qualifications to hold it . But Agnew was at least elected and then re-elected . Ford is an unelected Vice President who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have moved the President to choose a man known to the public and possessing qualifications that would have inspired their confidence . Like Agnew , Ford is a mediocrity . Agnew turned out to be fairly bright , but the same is unlikely to happen with Ford . He is ' a partisan politician whose lack of intellectual distinction worries even some of his GOP colleagues . " Jerry 's a great guy , " a House Republican told The Wall Street Journal , " but he 's no intellectual heavyweight . " Not only does he think in clich  --  s , he believes them . He is a loyal , plodding type of whom the late Lyndon Johnson once said that he could n't chew gum and walk at the same time and , on another occasion , sadly observed that Ford had played football at Michigan in the days before players wore , padded helmets . Unkind comments , but they vividly suggest Ford 's lack of distinction . He will be readily confirmed ; ' he is personally well ' liked in Congress ; he is obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not seek the Presidency in 1976 ) ; and his selection lessens the chances that Congress might be drawn into the ordeal of impeachment proceedings against the President . For Nixon , Ford was an easy selection . He is loyal to the President . He will not make Nixon feel uneasy nor , will he overshadow him , as Connally or Rockefeller might have done . The President always likes to keep possible rivals at a comfortable distance . Ford stands well with both parties in Congress and his selection will not kick up any feuding in the Republican Party . Reagan , Connally and Rockefeller may be disappointed , but they must endorse Ford 's nomination . And , like Congress , the President doubtless hoped that the thought of Ford succeeding him would silence any talk of impeachment . But it does not follow that the President is now home free . A few hours before his grotesque efforts to make a festive occasion of the announcement and thereby turn , the public 's mind from the " obsessions of the past " ( read : Watergate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a restrained but firm reminder that , while he was re-elected by a national ballot , he does not embody the nation 's sovereignty . So the issue of the tapes hangs over him . Also his personal finances , his handling of unspent 1968 campaign contributions , his curious tax returns , the activities of Bebe Rebozo and other pending anxieties , will keep a shadow on the White House . Archibald Cox has a staff of ninety which includes some bright and energetic young lawyers , a budget of $2.8 million and , so far , a ' free hand to pursue Watergate crooks and creeps . At intervals , Mr. Cox and staff will have unpleasant tidings for the President . We now know  --  from the Kiogh indictment  --  that the Ellsberg raid , justified in the name of " national security , " was financed by funds which Charles Colson gOt from the milk and dairy industry . We know , too , that Mr. Nixon spoke to " the milk crowd " on September 3 , 1971 , the same night that Dr. Fielding 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also know that John Ehrlichman told a Los Angeles grand jury that the President knew about this secret mission . The President doubtless thought that easing Agnew out would shore up his own defenses . It would , for example , remove the possibility that a court decision on the Vice President 's immunity might have some bearing on the President 's . And it would give Nixon an opportunity to remove some of the grime from his image by naming John Connally , or Nelson Rockefeller as Agnew 's successor : But he had to settle , as it turned out , for , a colorless care- , taker , and while first Congressional reactions , were pre- , dictably favorable , it is unlikely that liberal Republicans really approve the selection and it is certain that conservatives resent the way Agnew was shoehorned out of office . Thus , for all his scheming , the President has not cut himself free of the Agnew scandal . Naming Ford took care of the immediate political problem but , like ' Agnew 's uuster , it is another count against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he holds the American people . Indeed , if the Democrats were not so painfully deficient in wit and courage , they would refuse to confirm Ford until Nixon releases the tapes , pays whatever taxes he owes the government on the tangled San Clemente transaction , answers some questions about Bebe Rebozo and satisfies Congress on a number of other issues . They might even take the extreme position that Mr. Nixon should nominate a Vice President qualified to succeed to the Presidency . But the sad fact is , , as Max , Lerner noted in a recent column , that we are being " nibbled to death by the mice of narrow partisan thinking , by President and Congress alike , by both parties . " The crisis in the Middle East will divert attention momentarily from the President 's problems but eventually it could con-tribute to them . The President may b'e counting on the " mandate " he won at the polls last year , but , as Max Frankel notes in The NeW York Times , " the magic in the mandate wafted away long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agnew 's Apologia The least convincing speech Spiro T. Agnew ever made was his televised " farewell " address . Taking a charitable view , it can be dismissed as dishonest , nonresponsive , self-serving , rambling and churlish . Agnew was at some pains to downgrade the media and government officials as villains , perhaps because the two networks had given him prime time to deliver his apologia while government spokesmen maintained a discreet silence . He is , he tells us , really the victim of " bribe-brokers , extortionists and conspirators , " , i.e. , his intimate political associates of many years , , in Maryland politics who were encouraged to reduce their , possible punishment by accusing him . That hardly disposes of their charges . Yet with the exception of that one unfortunate $29,500 gratuity of 1967 , he insists he is innocent of any wrongdoing despite massive detailed documentation in the government 's report that he accepted at least $100,000 in bribes and perhaps more . True , the report does not constitute proof of guilt , but by copping a ' plea on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government to prove his guilt on the others . With this assurance he can afford to be bold and emphatic in his denials . If innocent of these other charges , he should have resigned and contested them in the courts . Granted that Maryland politics has a stench all its own , still Agnew did not take money to pay campaign expenses , but for his personal use . All he did , by his account , was to permit his " fund-raising activities " and " contract-dispensing activities " to overlap ! But even candidates " who do not possess large personal fortunes " are not entitled to enhance their net worth by accepting cash and not reporting it in their income tax returns . Coming in the wake of a story in the Nashville Banner in which Agnew appeared to be convinced that Nixon had forced him out of office , his fulsome praise of the President was hypocritical and a cowardly bid for continued protection . James Thompson , the U.S. Attorney in Cook County , summed up the government 's case against Agnew as " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Labeling Agnew " a crook , " he added : " the country is well rid of him . " And so it is , but it got rid of him by dubious means . The President initiated the plea-bargaining sessions . The President 's counsel ' met with Agnew 's lawyers in a Miami hotel room to work out the final details . These arrangements were then confirmed in a secret meeting in a motel and with Judge Walter E. Hoffman present . ( Whatever happened to the notion that judges were supposed to listen to counsel in open court or , on some matters , in chambers ? ) Of course , the removal of Agnew was essentially a political task and the judicial process had to be tactfully adjusted to carry it out as quickly and quietly as possible . But this consideration should , blind no one to the fact that seldom has a crook been treated with such deference . The fact that he occupied the office of Vice President does not justify the special treatment he received . If only to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handcuffed and carted off to serve , say , a day in jail . In a perceptive comment in Newsweek , , Stewart Alsop foresaw that , once Agnew had copped his plea , there would be " much buttery rhetoric applied-to his crockery . " Early in his career , Westbrook Pegler applied the term " bleeding hearts " to misguided liberals and others who opposed child labor , capital punishment , colonial wars , flogging , child abuse and mandatory life sentences for pickpockets . Since " bleeding hearts " can be applied only to liberals , another term , say , " bleeding ulcers , " must be used to describe those who bemoan Agnew 's downfall . The President calls for compassion . Editorial writers tell us that it is " tragic " that Agnew should leave office under a cloud and facing " a financial crisis . " ( Should we perhaps chip in to buy him an annuity , , since he , will notbe receiving a pension ? ) Senator Goldwater is outraged at the way Agnew was treated ; in Sacramento , Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cohn can not understand how a man " who made courage a household word " could act in such a craven manner . The chairman and vice chairman of the Conservative Party in New York are all shook up . To the first of these , Agnew " went out with dignity " ; to the second " the whole damn thing is tragic . " Tragic it might have been if Agnew had ' taken a leaf from the Greeks and acted like a tragic hero . But it is difficult to cast a plea-copper as a tragic hero . It would be easier to feel compassion for him if , in his farewell , he had said that he was guilty as charged and then expressed regret for what he had done . He might at least have offered his apologies to those loyal Republican ladies in Los Angeles to whom he had offered his " tormented verbal assertion " of total innocence . But he seems to be quite free of remorse . Instead of candor , there was evasiveness ; in place of regrets , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is right : the country is well rid of Spiro Agnew . About the kindest thing " bleeding hearts " can say of him is that he was not involved in Watergate and leaves office less responsible for the depressing at- , mosphere that prevails in Washington than the man who tapped him for the Vice Presidency , used him when needed , and then eased him out . Layers of Ugliness ' Richard R. Fagen is a professor , of political science at Stanford University , and vice president of the Latin American , Studies Association . His wife , Pat Fagen , is an assistant professor , at New College of San Jose State University . ' Both recently spent eighteen months in Chile ( February 1972-July 1973 ) . Fagen was in Santiago as a full-time social science consultant to the Ford Foundation ; he also taught as a visiting professor at the Latin American Faculty of the Social Sciences , a graduate training institution specializing in sociology and political science . Pat Fagen taught as an instructor at the university dUring the couple 's stay in Santiago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the degree of CIA involvement in the coup , because " the Nixon Administration and some large corporate interests began laying the groundwork , for the coup from the moment Allende assumed power three years ago . Chile 's credit was cut , its imports were banned , and its copper embargoed . While the government was without the foreign exchange to carry out its social objectives and productive goals , the military received more aid from the United States than any other government in Latin America . " That is one layer of ugliness , and quite to be expected . But it is only a beginning . Richard Fagen has uncovered a whole series of outrages , some involving arrests of American citizens , the murder of one and probably two , and the indifference of both American Embassy personnel on the ground and high-ranking State Department officials in Washington . While he was in Santiago , Fagen met a number of young Americans , graduate students and others who were , in varying degrees , sympathetic to the Allende experiment . These included three men in their 20s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terrugi is dead , Horman is missing and probably dead , Hathaway is safe home . Fagen knew all three well ; he employed , Horman and Hathaway as translators . ( Horman contributed articles to The Nation in 1968 and 1969 . ) Richard Fagen 's charges are contained in a 91/2-page letter , single-spaced , to Sen. J. William Fulbright , with copies to Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and others . He heard reports of the hostility of American Embassy personnel toward Americans in Chile ' who were sympathetic , or even " neutral , " toward the Allende regime . These Americans ' were referred to as " traitorous , " " commies , " " fellow travelers , " etc . It was as if the Embassy considered ' it the duty of Americans to be hostile to the Allende regime , and the , duty of Embassy personnel to be hostile toward ' those Americans who felt otherwise , even though their activities were in every respect legal and proper . Fagen says that the effective head of the Embassy throughout much of 1972 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now back in Washington as a top aide to Jack Kubisch , Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs . Shlaudeman " was often cited by persons who knew him as the high Embassy official most single-mindedly hostile to the positions and the activities of those Americans in Santiago who were supportive of the government . " In the course of a conversation with Fagen , a career U.S. Foreign Service officer volunteered the information that Frederick Purdy , Chief Consul of the U.S. Embassy in Santiago , was in fact a CIA agent . Fagen has no concrete proof of Purdy 's alleged dual role , but apparently other consular personnel were uneasy about the situation . At the end of July Fagen returned to ' the United States and , when the Chilean military rose against Allende , made a trip to Washington with three other officers of the Latin American Studies Association , acting as individuals . This group met for an hour with Kubisch on September 18 , and were told that there was no real reason to doubt the junta 's reports of the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered the military leaders to be basically " honest " and " good . " When on September 23 Fagen read in The New York Times of Horman 's arrest , he called Kubisch 's office and was told they would check on it . Through a Stanford graduate student , Fagen found that Terrugi and Hathaway had also been arrested . The Fagens then began a search for relatives of the arrested Americans and located them ; this was the first word the relatives had had of the young men 's plight . They had heard nothing from the State Department . Fagen , in almost daily telephonic contact with Kubisch 's office regarding the Horman , Hathaway and Terrugi cases , never received any information that he had not already read in a newspaper , heard on the radio , or received first-hand in telephone calls to Santiago . Terrugi was kept in the National Stadium , led away , and later found in the morgue , dead of multiple gunshot wounds . Horman was arrested on September 17 and on October 8 , when Fagen wrote his 6,000-word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from again . Hathaway was released by the Chilean military on " September 26 and Purdy got him out of the ' country . A puzzling sidelight on American EmbasiST procedure in Santiago : when Joyce Harman went to ' the Embassy to inquire about her husband , she was told by some functionary that " probably he just wanted to get away from you . " ' , A clarifying sidelight on Kubisch : at the September 18th meeting he said before four witnesses ( Fagen 's paraphrase ) : It was not in our interest to have the military take over in Chile . It would have been better had Allende served his entire term , taking the nation and the Chilean people into complete and total ruin . Only then would the full discrediting of socialism have taken place . Only then would people have gotten the message that socialism does n't work . What has happened the military takeover and bloodshed has confused this lesson . The press has not paid a great deal of attention to these " layers of ugliness , " but the Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sen. Adlai Stevenson is calling for an investigation of the ' State ' Department 's handling of the matter . Secretary Kissinger is having his troubles in the Middle East , ' but his action on this outrageous sequence will give us some indication of what to expect from him in the future . ' The immediate question for him to consider is whether American citizens are to receive equal protection when they go about their lawful occasions abroad ; or whether , if ' their views do not coincide with those of State Department personnel , they venture abroad at their own risk . Fagin 's Children Writing of delinquent children in this issue ( p. 426 ) , Larry Schultz says , " Juvenile court judges have no more answers than does anyone else . " The failure of judges and the public in general to come up with such answers may be traced , at least in part , to the fact that they operate on a series of false assumptions . Bill Haney and Martin Gold , both members of the University of Michigan Institute for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Psychology Today an article in which they offer evidence that the " typical juvenile delinquent " who is now the object of so much popular and official concern is largely a myth . All of us can draw a mental picture of this malignant youth : child of a fatherless home , member of a racial minority , hostile to school , if not a dropout , he belongs to a gang whose lair is in the ghetto and whose activities threaten the lives and property - of the law-abiding citizenry . But , say Haney and Gold , data compiled by their institute 's National ' Survey of Youth and other studies show that delinquency is not confined to lower-class youth , black or white . " It is just that middle-class kids are more likely to be overlooked , ' or that their parents can afford to buy them out of trouble , or ' that their actions are interpreted as hijinks ' rather than offenses . " Aside from the injustice implicit in the stereotype of the ' delinquent , what troubles these investigators is that the false assumptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , their research does not confirm the supposed strong relationship between delinquent behaidor and low social status ; indeed they find that white boys of higher status engage in somewhat more serious crimes than do their lower-status contemporaries . Nor do broken homes seem to produce more anti-social youngsters than do intact homes ( though it does seem that stepfathers are worse than no fathers at all ) . As of now , the authors conclude , " the delinvencyprevention industry " is stultified by its stereotype of the youthful offender . When it catches one that fits the image , the wheels of " justice " and " reform " operate with the implacability of any other conditioned reflex . Meanwhile , no one notices that only a tiny fraction of all delinquent acts are ever discovered , or that the energy of society is being spent to erase an image of wrongdoing not to discover the path of its cause and effect . It goes without saying that there are far too many juvenile offenders ( for that matter , what percentage of them would be considered satisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say Haney and Gold , ' and despite good Intentions and admirable dedication , no success is being achieved in seeing beyond The Delinquent to " a person with a real problem that is both his and ours . " The Black Dot System RaCial discrimination may prove expensive for , corporations and labor unions if a recent decision by federal Judge Damon Keith holds up on appeal . After a three-month trial , the judge ordered the Detroit Edison Company , the largest utility in Michigan , to pay $4 million to black workers who , he found , had suffered discrimination . He also ordered the company to bring its work force up to 30 per cent black and make sweeping changes in its hiring and promotion practices , e.g. , to promote one black for every white promoted , and to hire blacks for high-level and craftsman 's jobs until 25 per cent of the workers in these categories are black . Another part of the decision orders Local 223 of the Utility Workers of America to pay $250,000 in damages because , according to Judge Keith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stanford Univers'ity Law Prof. William Gould served without pay as chief counsel for the three plaintiffs in the case . Professor Gould has written for The Nation and is the author of a forthcoming book , Black Workers in White Unions . He got into this litigation , which has been in progress for three years , when he was a Wayne State law professor . When black workers came to see him , he says , " I just could n't turn them away . They began to describe a situation in Detroit that I 'd been writing about in other parts of the country . Here it was , right at home . " Professor Gould points out that if ' the utility appeals it may face final costs " of $10 million or more , since " the clock keeps ticking on back pay " and attorneys ' fees keep on increasing , although Professor Gould will still receive ' only out-of-pocket expenses . While Judge Keith 's decision is appealable , even as the case stands it should have a salutary , effect on employers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ) discrimination , which has a long history at Detroit Edison . According to a story in the Detroit Star , in the mid-1950s job interviewers for the company resorted to placing black dots on the application forms of black applicants . " The black dot system was used to perpetuate and maintain blacks in low-paying positions , " the judge found . An unusual finding is the award of damages to unknown persons who were deterred from trying for a job with Detroit Edison because of the company 's reputed prejudice against blacks . " It 's a monumental decision , " says U.S. Attorney Ralph Guy , who joined the suit against the company under a provision of the 1964 Civil Rights Act . " If a black man who , say , wanted to work as an Edison ' lineman did n't apply for a job because he had heard the company did n't hire blacks , he is entitled to back pay for the job he did n't even go after . " This part of the decision may be modified on appeal , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrimination . Never hesitate to apply for a job because you feel you have no chance because of color , sex , age , etc . If you refrain , you are not only passing up a chance to collect personal damages but you are in effect acquiescing in the mistreatment of the group to which you belong , and in social injustice generally .
