CLE L 163 DOLLEE COLT All animals are God 's creatures , and I would be the first to speak for those who can not speak for themselves . But to me rodeo is a great and exciting sport , a genuinely American festival with more deep-down meaning than a symphony or a ballet . The central figure in any rodeo is , of course  --  tall , swift , a thing of beauty  --  the horse . It is his nature to run , and it is his fate to be ridden . These two things alone have altered the history of the world perhaps more than anything else right up to our own time . The conquering Assyrians , the hordes of Genghis Kahn , the Crusaders , the famous charge that failed at Waterloo , Sheridan 's pursuit of Lee 's shattered infantry right up to the farmhouse at Appomattox  --  the sweep of cavalry was always the deciding element in war ever since civilization itself began in Asia Minor , until the first decade of this century . The horse has altered the map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , old Equus was performing even more valuable tasks  --  not always pulling the plow , either . On the vastness of America 's plains country where cattle came to be king , the cowboy and his horse were the working team that in one way made the greatness of this country possible , as huge areas were traversed by big mounted men and were made habitable . This is the heritage I see today in rodeo which I believe must be preserved . A heritage of skills and hardihood , of outdoor living and courage ready to be tested almost any and every minute ; a performance of man and mount that becomes a ballet in itself because the minds and muscles of both have learned how to work together in an admirable partnership . Feeling this way , I find working with animals and on worthwhile animal projects one of my favorite and most rewarding activities . I am a commissioner of the Detroit Zoo , a director of the Michigan Humane Society , and a member of the Animal Advisory Board of Oakland County in Michigan . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneak in a ride or two as a cowgirl . In this way , I encounter the deep and sometimesvicious opposition to the very thought of rodeo that exists in the minds of many otherwise well-balanced people . Now I do not expect them to change their thoughts because of mine . But I believe that many of them are misguided and uninformed . They tend to overreact to the sights of rodeo , because of overemotionalism about animals . In modern life , many people have no contact with animals except as household pets  --  birds , dogs , cats , or perhaps even smaller fry . They learn to be kind and protective . Sometimes overprotective . And they begin to confuse a horse with a kitten , a steer with a poodle . They even go out and raise money to fight the " barbarians " who are allegedly exploiting animals . And so , in the last few years there has been a concerted attack on the cowboys ' world of rodeos . I think it is they who are wrong , usually  --  let me put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are talking about . Let me tell you why : My interest in animals began when I was a youngster in Kingsville , Texas . I spent my summers on the world-famous King Ranch camping with , and faithfully tracking on the heels of , Doctor Northway , head veterinarian for the Ranch . I called him Uncle Doc and his wife Gertnide was simply , to me , Aunt Gertrude . Until 1 was ten years old I actually thought they were blood relatives . A typical day with Doc might include an inspection and work stop at the stall and paddock of Kentucky Derby winner , Assault , or some cowboying and vigorous work with Santa Gertrudis cattle , a great breed developed by the King Ranch . Always one of my favorite events was a bull sale . VIP 's from all over the country would gather to down a little branch water ( that 's liquor to you city folk ) and not bat an eye when a single bull would sell for $50,000 or more . While growing up , I worked day and night with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you have had some steady work in your lifetime , try living and working on a real ranch during lambing ( no ewe ever had a lamb on dry ground  --  always in mud and rain  --  and 2 a.m. seemed to be the chosen hour ) or during calving time when you are on twenty-four-hour call as a midwife . Or try working those fourteen-hour , seven-day weeks out in the field following the roundup wagon on an endless cycle of riding , roping , branding , dehorning , worming and vaccinating . This background furnished me with some of the best years of my life and an education with animals that ca n't be gleaned from books , lectures or the mere raising of a house pet . When you work with animals that sometimes live in a semiwild statein pastures that may range for miles before you hit a fence line , you learn that animals are a Iot like people . They have many of the same feelings and they will often react the same way to a similar situation . You learn that all animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals you learn early that there are unwritten rules you have to follow or you are going to get hurt . For example , when you pen a ton of bull " on the prod " ( that 's a sexy bull ) , you do not naively walk into the pen with some goody in your hand and say , " Here nice bully , come over to the chute and let the good doctor give you your brucellosis test . " No sir , you have to be a cowboy ( or cowgirl ) to handle that and thousands of other large-animal situations that come up daily in regular ranch work , from roping cattle in the big pasture to doctoring them for screw worms ( we had a terrible outbreak in the southwest with screw worms this past year ) or the breaking of a cantankerous colt that is feeling more than his share of oats . That 's why when some wild and ridiculous claims about rodeo were made by individuals and organizations , I thought it time to tell it like it is . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucking broncos but , rather , domesticated horses . Well , just what is a domesticated horse and what is a bucking bronco ? Without going to a dictionary , my belief is that all horses are domesticated , except for the few thousand mustangs we still have roaming some of our national preserves , and they for the most part are no longer the mustangs of 100 years ago . They have been crossbred with so many ranch mares they have stolen from cow outfits that the mustang as a breed is generally mixed up . Some blood lines run back to Spain ; others just to a kid 's backyard when his horse jumped the fence and headed for the hills . In my opinion , a bronco , or brone as cowboys call them , is a bad horse that does not want to be ridden . I 've seen them on the King Ranch , other ranches and in my own pasture . I have a gelding named Sunny who proves it to me at least ten times a year . Sunny is a bad actor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rodeos may be domesticated horses , but they are also broncs , and , unfortunately , they are getting scarcer every year . The popularity of rodeos has grown in America fantastically ( over 3,000 individual rodeos in the country this year ) , and with ranches raising fewer horses the supply is not as plentiful as it needs to be . Because of the demand for bucking horses it is impossible to purchase a good one for less than $300 and prices often run into four figures . Another wild claim is that the bucking of rodeo horses is an unnatural action . Hogwash ! Bucking is one of the most natural movements horses make and every horse does it from the time he can walk . Anytime a horse is cooped up in a stable , as tens of thousands of them are in America , when he is turned out into a pen or pasture , the first thing he is going to do is jump up , buck and run to get the kinks out . The same is true of cows . It is also claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At first these experts charged that the strap was cutting into the genitals of the horse . . until they learned that 99 percent of all bucking horses used in rodeos were mares or geldings ! The fact is that even a stallion is constructed so that a strap can not touch the genital area . The flank strap is simply a piece of foreign equipment the Nine wants to jump out of , and in the process he will kick higher in the back end ? ( we call the rear the business end of a horse ) ? and probably throw the cowboy off over his head . ( Another fact about the flank strap is that in veterinary work the vet will often flank a bull to lay him down . If the flank strap is pulled snugly the bull will lie down like a trained dog . ) It is charged that a piece of equipment invented by a veterinarian for the humane movement of livestock , the hot shot or cattle prod , is used brutally to assault animals in rodeos . Some have even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jammed up the rectum of broncs or bulls to make them buck . Nonsense ! Pure nonsense ! The way bucking chutes are constructed there is absolutely no way any electric charge can be placed in the rectum of a horse or bull , to say nothing of the danger involved in dealing like that with these big , powerful animals . On the other hand , hot shots ( using batteries similar to flashlight batteries ) are sparingly used in rodeos for the purpose for which they were created  --  to move livestock that have frozen in position and will not untrack . ( Prods are used for the same purpose by large animal veterinarians , livestock haulers and stockyards ' handlers across the country . ) The hot shots are used sparingly at rodeos , not because of the danger to livestock , but because after a couple of months most rodeo animals become showmen and learn where to go and what to do . Quite simply , rodeo rules forbid the use of hot shots on bucking horses and bulls unless the animal freezes and the contestantrequests the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal the minor shock and surprise make him jump and forget about freezing in position . The shock has no lasting affect and causes no injury to the animal . One " humane " group has charged that rodeo cowboys use twisted wire snaffle bits to cut horses ' tongues in two . This gtoup actually used a false photograph to illustrate its point . Well , I have never met a cowboy who knows what a twisted wire snaffle bit is and I do n't know either . The fact is that no bits at all are used in bronc riding , whether for regular ranch work in breaking colts the first few ridings or for rodeo competition . A hackamore is used , which is really just a cotton rope halter with nothing inserted into the mouth . It has been said that the spurs used by cowboys are used to viciously cut horses and bulls . In answer to this , it should be stated that the modern American cowboy 's spurs are probably the most humane used by any horseman in the world today or at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cowboy 's spurs must be blunt and can not cut an animal or the rider is subject to disqualification and a heavy fine . The rowel of such a spur is like a quarter or nickel that must revolve freely so it can not jab into a horse to give the cowboy an anchor . It is the same kind of spur I 've owned for twenty-five years . One brochure that attacked rodeo and asked readers for monetary contributions charged that one out of every fifteen steers used in rodeos was crippled or killed . The truth is that the American Humane Association , the largest humane organization in the United States ( affiliated with over 700 local humane societies ) , has kept diligent records about injury rates for rodeo animals . According to AHA figures , less than one-tenth of one percent are injured . They are actually safer in the rodeo arena than on a farm or ranch where according to AHA figures the injury rates run higher . The fact is that professional rodeo has the smallest injury rate of any animal event in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Convention and In-ternational Finals Rodeo in Tulsa , Okla-homa , officials of AHA sit down with ro-deo officials and take a close look at the hu-mane rules of rodeo competition . There are forty-two such rules in the IRA professional rodeo rule book . According to Milton Searle , Director of Animal Protection Services for AHA , the rodeo people have never turned down a reasonable request concern-Mg the treatment of rodeo animals . Now , let 's look at what rodeo really does for animals . fit were not for rodeo , thousands of outlaw horses ( animals that can not be broken or trusted for regular ranch or pleasure riding ) would become dog food each year . Nobody has a useful purpose for these horses and there is n't anyone I know of who can afford to feed them just to look at them . It costs a minimum of $150 a month to-house and feed and medically care for a horse . Some cowboys say that a good bucking horse is really the aristocrat of the horse world . He has learned that if he can dump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work eight or ten seconds about thirty times a year , and the rest of the time languish in green pastures or eat the finest of scientifically rationed grains to keep him in peak physical condition . After attempting to break and ride some of these horses in my younger days , I am inclined to agree . Many bucking horses in rodeos are twenty or twenty-five or more years of age and still doing their regular work in fine shape . There is no other horse activity that can make that kind of claim for its animals . Rodeo bulls are generally crossbred animals that would not be used by beef ' men for reproductive purposes . A good bucking bull can live a dozen or so years in a rodeo string of livestock , rather than head to the bologna factory at a young age . .13 The Mexican longhorn steers used in steer wrestling , or bulldogging . as cowboys say it , are rough , tough animals . Although the bulldogging event , when done by professionals , looks simple , a novice jumping off the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a steer can very easily be impaled by the horns or even crippled for life -- not the steer , the cowboy . While these Mexican cute . " And the choice is rodeo or veal Parmesan . And what about the riding horses used in rodeos  --  the quarter horse , the most popular of all breeds in the U.S. today ? If it were n't for the rodeo-roping cowboy , the quarter horse might still be running in the country , straightaway dust tracks of south Texas . It was the rodeo roper who took the fledgling new quarter horse from the July /August ' 73 ranches of the West and put him in rodeo arenas across the country twenty-five and thirty years ago . He exposed the quarter horse , with his early speed and good-natured disposition , to millions and millions of rodeo fans who liked what they saw and bought these animals by the tens of thousands . And today , the richest horse race in the world is no longer the Kentucky Derby , the Preakness or the Belmont Stakes , but rather the giant Quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one race pays a bigger purse than the above named three thoroughbred races put together ! The Ruidoso race pays $1 million , but in my opinion , if it had not been for the rodeo-roping cowboy , the quarter horse would still be a minor-league animal . In almost every single western community , there is an annual rodeo . And chances are very good that that one rodeo is the biggest single event in the entire year . People will come for a hundred miles around to see not only the big-league pros in action but also their favorite local cowboy , who may get thrown on his head or who may win more prize money in a few seconds than he could earn punching cows on the ranch for a month or more . In many western and southwestern towns rodeo makes possible the " best " retail-sales week of the entire year , and I do n't mean just the little towns . I 'm also including such metropolitan giants as San Antonio , Houston and Denver . Rodeo is moving eastward and towns like Monroe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This early fall rodeo , too , creates the best sales week of the year for merchants , but more than that , it has welded true community spirit into both Monroe and its immediate neighbor , West Monroe . This year Monroe 's Mayor Troy challenged West Monroe 's Mayor Hatten to a drawing contest in the middle of the rodeo arena on opening night . It looked mighty serious , and you could hear a pin drop as the mayors paced it off with hands on six guns each under a spotlight in a darkened arena . Then the lights came on and each sat down to a milk stool for a cow milking contest that drew belly laughs and let the local citizenry know that their mayors were both sporty parts of the celebration . In Monroe and hundreds of other western towns there is much more to the rodeo than the actual rough-and-tumble arena competition . There 's a big downtown parade , chuckwagon breakfasts , lunches and dinners on shopping-center parking lots , sponsored by the centers or various civic groups ; cowboy history , western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine festive flavor involves young and old alike , some of them riding their favorite saddle horses in the parade or rodeo grand entry . Rodeo is a wholesome sport for youth as well as adults , and it teaches rural youngsters , who fortunately can become involved , the real value of animals ; not monetarily , but rather what those animals can do for man in working and performing with him , which is more important than the cold , hard facts of simply raising cattle for slaughter . Today , youngsters get involved in rodeo competition at a very young age . Little Britches and Miniature rodeo competition feature youngsters fourteen years of age and under . The annual Little Britches Championship at Littleton , Colorado , last year drew over 1,000 cowboys and cowgirls of this age . High school rodeo , too , has become a highly organized event with well over twenty different states coming up with finalist teams that compete for a national championship . Intercollegiate rodeo now ineludes 112 schools that enter teams for intercollegiate competition . Collegiate rodeo is where I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is nothing like regularly jockeying a well-tuned barrel horse to keep a girl in shape and to help her remain in close contact with some of the last of the real individualists in this country , the American cowboys . Cowboys may down a beer or two , but narcotics and hard booze are not on their menu , as rodeoing requires top physical and mental conditions . Well , I 've said my piece . Rodeo is an exciting , humanely run sport . It is part of our heritage and it deserves to be preserved . So long , pardner.
