txt A basic misunderstanding was involved in the chain of events culminating in American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. ' s astonishing withdrawal of its record $600 million securities offering . Some top Justice Department officials mistakenly believed that the sale already had been completed when they filed sweeping antitrust charges against the telecommunications giant last Wednesday . In fact , the offering would n't have ended until tomorrow , when investors would have paid for their purchases and underwriters would have delivered a $800 million check to AT &T.; Now , of course , none of that money will change hands ; AT &T; decided early Friday This article was compiled front reports by Wall Street Journal stall reporters Mitchell C. Lynch in Washington and Phil Hawkins , Lindley B , Richert and Sanford L. Jacobs in New York . to cancel its issue of new 81/8% notes and 8%% debentures because of unsettled market conditions resulting from the antitrust suit . " We want investors to have sufficient time to consider fully this new development , " Charles L. Brown , the company 's executive vice president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering , the Justice Department insisted that it could n't have delayed filing the antitrust suit even if all its officials had been aware that the AT &T; offering still was in progress . To have delayed the filing would have exposed the department itself to criminal and civil prosecution . Its filing took place when it did because " the investigation had been completed , the case had been prepared , and the suit had been approved " by Attorney General William B. Saxbe , a department spokesman said . A Surprise in the Paper Nevertheless , ' several officials conceded that " we almost fell out of our chairs when we read Thursday morning in The Wall Street Journal that the offering had been put in jeopardy because of the antitrust suit . We thought the sale had been completed . " They contend , however , that such knowledge would have been irrelevant as far as filing the suit goes . The confusion undoubtedly stemmed from earlier reports of heavy investment demand in the new notes and debentures , which represented the largest public sale ever by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the New York Stock Exchange , although transactions were on a conditional when-issued basis . Both AT &T; and its chief underwriter , Salomon Brothers , scrambled frantically in the immediate aftermath of the Justice Department suit to prevent the offering from being scuttled . Their lawyers flew to Wash ? ington on Thursday in an effort to gain Securities and Exchange Commission clearance of the changes in the official offering prospectus necessitated by the antitrust action . The SEC on Disclosure That agency was adamant on two points . It wanted to ensure that the suit be adequately disclosed through an amendment or revision in AT &T's; registration statement and that buyers who had already committed themselves be given " a reasonable period of time  --  overnight would be enough " ? to consider the information and decide whether they wanted to carry out their purchase commitment , an SEC spokesman disclosed , Stanley Sporkin , director of the agency 's enforcement division , said that all the details had been worked out so the offering could be completed and that the SEC was waiting for AT &T; to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was surprised by the cancel . lation , although I realized that was a possibility , " he added . Many others were startled by AT &T's; decision Friday . The day before , Salomon Brothers opened a campaign designed to shore up sagging interest in the two-part issue . Disaffection clearly was spreading among the prospective customers , including Irwin Smith , the Connecticut deputy treasurer for investment , who tentatively had ordered about $3 million of the debentures , " We had n't made up our minds whether to accept or refuse these securities , " he said . An Offer by Salomon To counter this growing apprehension , Salomon purportedly told brokers to pass the word that it would be willing to repurchase an unspecified amount of the notes and debentures from registered dealers . Its openness in the trade was sharp contrast to the usual practice ; generally , a supporting firm insists that its identity be keep secret by the intermediary broker . One market source estimated that Salomon was deluged when dealers asked it to repurchase 805 million to $70 million of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledge to outsiders that it had initiated a buy-back operation . John H. Gutfreund , a partner at Salo ? mon , did express disappointment Friday over the withdrawal of a seemingly successful offering in midstream . " If the suit had come a week earlier or a week later , this would n't have happened , " he assorted . Prior to the filing of the suit , it was believed that purchase orders had already accounted ' for all but a small portion of the AT &T; offering , ( For the reaction cf the bond market Friday to the AT &T; withdrawal , see story on page 27 . ) James J. Needham , chairman of the Big Board , also criticized the timing of the antitrust move . " Leaving aside any consideraLion of the merits of the suit , the Justice Department 's action comes at a time when fresh infusions of investment capital are desperately needed , not only by the nation 's public utilities but throughout American business and industry , and the suit has quickly triggered some very undesirable consequences . With public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business being called on to raise greater amounts of investment capital than ever before to fill expanding national needs and create new jobs , the timing of this action raises some very basic questions about our national priorities , " Mr. Needham said . Another government agency apparently was drawn into the picture as a result of the confusion among many investors after AT &T's; withdrawal . The Federal Reserve System pumped millions of dollars into the market Friday , almost certainly in part to stabilize price and trading conditions . " The Fed 's purchase of Treasury securities undoubtedly was aimed at putting additional money into circulation for the year-end holiday period , but I suspect it also wanted to offset the market jitters triggered by the AT &T; cancellation , " one dealer remarked . Certain large investors also would have been spared some knotty problems if the offering had gone ahead . These institutions liquidated old bonds from their portfolios to raise cash for AT &T's; fresh debt obligations . They , now must decide whether to reinvest in other securities , to wait for a substitute AT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds they have just sold to dealers . " Unraveling all of these complex swap transactions could present Wall Street with another back-office crisis , " one brokerage official suggested . A substitute AT &T; offering is expected , but the timing is n't known . AT &T; indeed " will be back for the $600 million , " John D. deButts , its chairman , said on CBS 's " Face the Nation " yesterday . He would n't give any details of the revised offering , however . In recent years , the concern has tapped public investors for about $4 billion to help meet the $10 billion annual construction budget by its Bell System operating subsidiaries . Ironically , AT &T; eventurally might be able to offer alternative securities yielding less than the 81A3% and 8518% on its canceled issues if the recent downtrend in general interest rates continues , market analysts speculated . " The company conceivably could benefit from this withdrawal by getting a lower actual cost in the future , " one specialist commented . Several AT &T; executives met all day Friday to discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the executive vice president , said that " we obviously need the money , but the world is n't coming to an end . Bell is n't out of cash . I do n't think we 'll have to increase bank borrowings . We have various sources of financing . " Because of the depressed state of the economy , AT &T; is considering a reduction to its projected $10.5 billion building program for next year , Mr. Brown disclosed . He quickly added that the contemplated cost , cutting was n't in any way related to the Justice Department suit . While the government case " is going to make it more difficult and possibly more costly to finance , we certainly are n't going out of business , " he said . Nor does that appear to be the department 's intention , although its action is the largest antitrust suit ever filed , based on the assets of the company involved . Essentially , the suit seeks the divestiture of Western Electric Co. , the Bell System 's manufacturing arm , and the splitting up of Western Electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to split off AT &T's; Long Lines Department , which handles long-distance calls , from the corporation 's local operating companies , either by divestiture of the Long Lines unit or by sales of some or all of the operating companies . The suit leaves the door open for the Justice Department to seek the divestiture of Bell Telephone Laboratories Inc. , the company 's research arm , from AT &T.; AT &T's; decision to withdraw its offering while in progress was unusual though not unique . A similar step was taken last month by another utility , Florida Power &; Light Co . Salomon also was senior manager in that $125 million bond sale , which was withdrawn because of a legal controversy over Florida Power 's right to continue collecting additional revenue through its fuel-adjustment clause .
