txt We and others have occasionally toyed with the idea of a national service corps that would alleviate such domestic ills as teen-age unemployment , young people 's disaffection , the decline of community services and the lack of Army volunteers . Now the idea has been endorsed by a diligent study committee , led by Jacqueline Wexler , the outgoing president of Hunter College , and Harris Wofford , former president of Bryn Mawr . The panel proposes a corps of a million young volunteers aged 16 to 25 that would cost $8 billion a year . The idea is still appealing but it does not seem practical in the foreseeable future . The committee envisions recruits coming from well-to-do families as well as from the hard-core unemployed . It expects some to choose military service , thus producing a better mix of volunteers for the Army , which is running short of suitable recruits . Most volunteers would be assigned to community and government agencies to perform such tasks as tutoring , manning day-care centers and renovating abandoned housing . What would entice them to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minimum wage . The committee thinks , rather , that many young people are awaiting a call to public service , while others want either to do something meaningful with their lives or else to train for later jobs . It says the corps would not only perform useful services but also help to overcome the anxieties of joblessness , idleness and alienation . ? We are not persuaded , however , that a national service corps can help the volunteer Army . Why , for instance , would a desirable college graduate be more likely to join the Army through the corps than to join directly ? The remedy for the military 's manpower problems will have to be found instead in more attractive inducements ? or perhaps in restoration of the standby draft . More important , we doubt that civilian community service would do much for chronically unemployed teen-agers . It might well enrich the lives of some aimless middle-class youngsters . Through chores like rehabilitating housing , it might also give some poor youths marketable skills . But we ca n't see how a factory owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in caring for the elderly or tending public playgrounds . The case for the corps would be much more compelling if its program were primarily concerned not with any psychic rewards but with the young people 's future employability . There are other difficulties as well . Proponents of the corps expect community agencies to find useful work for the million members . But we doubt that many agencies will want to bother each year with training a new wave of raw recruits . More likely , the corps would have to be run from Washington . As for the huge cost of the project , there seems little chance that it could ever get through a Congress that is already unwilling , or unable , to pay for national health insurance and welfare reform , and is cutting back on CETA 's public jobs . The nation is still stumped by the puzzle of unemployment among teen-aged blacks . Now is not the time to divert to already privileged youth even one dollar of the dwindling funds earmarked for their underprivileged peers . Nor should we lure poor youngsters into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prepare them for , their entry into the world of work .
