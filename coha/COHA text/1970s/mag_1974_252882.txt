San Francisco Educator Edward Kloster estimates that more than half the students in his institution need help with their reading . He is particularly concerned about the 250 or 300 who can not even decipher words . Kloster is not , as one might suppose , a teacher in an elementary school . He is chairman of the reading department at City College of San Francisco , and his nonreading students are graduates of San Francisco 's public high schools . They are just one reason why many San Franciscans agree with the county grand jury , which last month declared : " The most serious problem facing the city is the deterioration of its public school system . " <P> In the past , the grand jury-selected annually to investigate the city government-has praised the schools . This year 's blistering indictment is just one of many attacks on a school system that is becoming increasingly beset by troubles as pervasive as the city 's fogs . Since 1969 , reading and math scores for San Francisco students have been dropping steadily ; they are now well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by noisy , contentious community factions attacking each other , the board and Board President Eugene S. Hopp . At a recent meeting , police had to quell a minor riot that erupted when spectators attacked 13 uniformed American Nazi Party members , who were present to protest school integration plans . The board has already missed an HEW-imposed January deadline for approving an integration plan for secondary schools . <P> The Supreme Court has added to the board 's difficulties by requiring it to set up special English courses for the sizable minority of students who speak only Chinese ( TIME , Feb. 4 ) . On another front , attorneys are preparing to defend the city against a $500,000 suit filed on behalf of a boy who claims that he was allowed to graduate from Galileo High School with only fifth-grade reading skills . As a result , he is unqualified for any job " other than the most demeaning , unskilled , low-paid labor . " <P> One of the major problems for the board has been the accelerating flight of white children from the public schools - aggravated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the drop in total enrollment from 90,600 in 1968 to 77,000 last fall . Although San Francisco 's population is 57% white , only 27% of public school pupils are white ( v. 40% in 1968 ) ; some 28,000 white children now attend private and parochial schools in the city . The remaining public school pupils are a polyglot collection who speak 33 different native tongues . The 73% from nonwhite minority groups include blacks ( 30% ) , Chinese ( 16% ) , Mexican and Latin Americans ( 14% ) and Filipinos ( 7% ) .
