txt HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS , Prince Charles . heir to the British throne , successor to William the Conqueror , Henry VIII , Elizabeth I , and Victoria , kissed a girl on Washington Street Wednesday . " She gave him a flower and he kissed her on both cheeks , " an observer said . And then there were a lot of squeals . There were squeals and sighs and even tears just about everywhere Charles went during his day-long tour of Chicago . It was . . . well , it was rather amazing , really . It was amazing to see a young man , who may one day be the king of England , whose ancestors darn near ruled the world , whose roots go back to the kings and queens who shaped history for a thousand years , work the crowds with down-home touch that would be envied by any American man of the people . IT WAS equally amazing to see the citizens of a country who just celebrated the 200th anniversary of independence from the British crown treating the heir to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter and Robert Redford . Close-up with Dorothy Collin The sun may now set on the British Empire , but it was high noon for Prince Charles as he made his Nay around the city . During his La Salle Street " walkabout , " people crushed toward him , scaring the hell out of a small army of security men and women . " This is madness , " shouted one of the prince 's aides as Charles and Mayor Bilandic were engulfed somewhere near the curb at La Salle and Randolph . " Hi , Prince , " men yelled , seemingly standing on each other 's shoulders and reaching over heads for the prince 's hand . " I touched him , I , tourned him . I 'm never going to wash my hand , " said Charles  --  city gets new ' voter , ' page 3 More photos are on the Back Page women who ordinarily do n't fall apart at the sight of a handsome face framed I ; big ears .

" Boy , he sure has a grip , " Ann said . " He was so friendly , the smile on his face , his eyes are so nice , " said Carol . " Oh . . . I just ca n't BELII:VE I shook his hand , " they both said . Bill Maroney , a travel consultant , was // Prince touches Chicago and vice versa // a bit more restrained . He even had the presence of mind to discuss business with the prince . " I told him I was a travel consultant and that we were having a lot of trouble finding hotel space for tours over there , " Maroney said . " He said , ' Oh , yes , everyone 's going over . ' " But Charles did not offer to put up the tours at Buckingham Palace . MAHONEY SAID business was n't the only reason he wanted to meet Charles . " It was because of curiosity and because of the admiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I admire the tradition of the English people . " At one La Salle Street intersection , a man held up his son and announced to him : " It 's a Prince , " as though he were pointing out a wonder , something on the order of Mt . Everest or the Grand Canyon . Even some mild-mannered protesters at the University of Chicago were somewhat cowed by a real , live , big-time prince right there at Ida Noyes Hall . " We want to make sure people know what 's been going on in Northern Ireland , " said Roger Horowitz of New York , explaining why he and several other students held up signs protesting the British role in Ulster . " But we did n't want to make a big protest . We did n't want to disrupt anything . " HOROWITZ DID GET a little fiery when he accused the U. of C. , which seemed to fancy itself Oxford-onthe-Midway most of the day , of spending too much money to remove leaves from the grass . But he would .

Needless to say , a prince telling such stories brought down the house . He also talked about money , his education , Britain 's race problems , and Northern Ireland and Rhodesia . He did n't say anything earth-shaking but , as one student said later , " he was quite impressive , " Perhaps more than anything he showed Chicagoans that he has been superbly trained for his job as prince , goodwill ambassador , and symbol of Britain . He also showed them that princes can be human . At the Museum of Science and Industry , where he viewed the famed hatching-chicks exhibit , the U-505 , and a giant washing machine , he stopped at an exhibit of nutritional foods called " Food for Life . " Observing a display of waxed fruit , he turned to museum guide Jane Baum and remarked with a smile : " That 's the biggest pear I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a button , " Close-up seemed to understand the crowd that had gathered . " They are ' curious , " he said . " There are not many princes left in the world . " Actually , the prince 's visit to the University of Chicago was even more amazing than his La Salle Street jaunt . At one point , when the prism took a stroll around campus , he was like the Pied Piper . An ever-growing crowd of students and faculty followed him across lawns , into buildings , back out of buildings , across more lawns , into the street , anywhere he went , except to tea . Then they waited outside . And Charles would stop every few moments and talk with students , asking what their majors were , dropping witty comments , dispensing vast quantities of royal charm . HIS CONVERSATION with Thomas Heineman , of Ft . Wayne , Ind. , and Kathi Martell , of Boonton , N.J. , left them " flabbergasted . " It also left Kathi sighing in shock In Thomas ' arms . And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home of wild-eyed radicals , where students used to hold a protest every 30 seconds , and anarchy instead of monarchy was king . Prince Charles was especially charming and quick . on his verbal feet during a question-and-answer session with students who live in the Burton-Judson Courts . He began ' ' by ' talking about his ancestor , George III , whom he defended as " a product of the period in which he lived " and as a good king in many ways , though " self-righteous " and a " bit of a prig . " AFTER ' A COUPLE of questions about George , a student asked whether the prince thought the monarchy was anachronistic . " It 's easy to think it is an anachronistic institution , " Prince Charles said . " I went through a phase , when I was younger , when I thought it was a bit of relic . " But I see now it is not necessarily an anachronism . In a way it fulfills a certain need or desire some people have in that a constitutional monarchy does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above it all . " It 's great advantage is Its human aspect . It still has a role , to perform . It depends on what you make of it . " In answering another question , the prince discussed countries such as France and Germany that once had absolute monarchs , got rid of them , but now are fascinated by royal personages . " What people have n't got , they miss , " Charles said . " On the continent they are fascinated by monarchy . But if they had it , they would get rid of it ? like you qwq
