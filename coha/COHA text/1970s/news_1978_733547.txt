txt TOE YOUNG men peered blearily at the group of women and men marching down State street in the St. Patrick 's Day Parade . They listened to the marchers chant and looked at the buttons they wore . Then they raised their beer cans high and bellowed : " Rah . Rah . IRA " . The marchers waved and yelled and everyone was happy , caught in the spirit of a fine St. Paddy 's Day . The only problem was that the chants and buttons actually said " ERA . " Not everyone along the parade route was quite so befogged as the young men . but it 's doubtful that many recognized the small , smiling tray-haired woman in the front row of the Chicago Irish Feminists . She was Betty Friedan , author of the " The Feminine Mystique , " one Of the founders of the National Organization for Women , and the woman who began the modern women 's movement . SHE . IIAD COME to Chicago , ' a town where the Irish Republican Army is of-Close-up with Dorothy Collin ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to convince people that the constitutional amendment insuring equal rights for women will die in Illinois if they do n't do something fast to save it : She had marched in the parade as one of many appearances to raise support and money for her Emergency Project for Equal Rights , " I thought it had a nice spirit to it , " she said a few hours later at a fund-raising reception high - above Chicago 's Gold Coast , She ' Was sitting on a leather sofa , surrounded by a dozen or so women and two men , They seemed . a little awed , . // Friedan fears parade will pass by ERA // with having an authentic , historic gorseage to chat with , ONE WOMAN asked how her recent book , " It Changed My Life , " was doing . Betty talked about her daughter , a student at Harvard Medical School . " My daughter , the doctor , " she said to pleased laughter . Then another woman asked how ERA backers can cope with the " apathy and fear " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question . She thinks arguing witlk the opposition to the ERA about unisex washrooms only plays into the skillful hands of Phyllis Schiafiy , leader of the antiERA forces . What Betty is concerned with is political organizing and pressure , the kind that might convince some legislators to switch their votes , the kind that might defeat legislators who do n't switch their votes . " THE PRESSURES the legislators have been listening to are from the right-wing , " she said . " The only evidence of urgency , of hysteria , of passion has been from women whipped up by the opposition , The crux of it here is whether people of real political power will do something to countervail that pressure . " I know Gov . Thompson says he is for it . And so does the Democratic leadership . But if they think they can get away with saying they are for it , but not Close-up lift a finger to put their political weight behind it , they are contemptuous of women and the issue . " The real opposition Is from rightwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been threatened by the victories women have won in many areas . ERA Is where they chose to fight . " The ERA wo n't do anything very much , really . It 's the constitutional underpinning for the gains we have already won , But they want to take those gains away . " THE WOMEN and men listened attentively , sipping wine and nibbling on canapes . Betty dabbed at her nose , her 1 o n g - running cold apparently made worse by her march down State Street . " Well , are you hopeful about the ERA ? " a woman asked . " I think we are more grimly aware of the emergency this year , " Betty said . " What I sense here and around the country is that people are becoming aware there is a real danger the ERA will not pass . " And so she and other NOW leaders and other women 's rights activists and just plain women are taking time from their jobs and families and other projectq to concentrate on passing the ERA , she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illinois , for years . And as Betty talked so earnestly and so intelligently about why and how the amendment should be passed , I thought of a conversation I had with a leader of the Illinois legislature at another party a few weeks ago . HE SAID THE ERA would not pass in the current legislature . He said legislators were either afraid of the anti 's or so tired of the whole thing they wanted it to just disappear , He said they were sick of it . Ironically , Freidan told the people gathered around her that she was " sick of fighting for it . But if it goes down , you can forget about going ahead with child care , and flexible hours for working mothers , and other legislation . " A woman said , " Good Luck , " Freidan . replied : " It 's more than good luck we need , We want you people to help . That 's what this is all about , " ' It was time for the money pitch . A couple of the women wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I already sent you a check . " THEN BETTY had to leave for a reception at the Belmont Harbor Yacht Club sponsored by the Chicago chapter of NOW . As she arrived and was swept up the stairs by NOW members and friends , a middle-aged male employe of the Yacht Club looked after her with an expression of distaste mixed with fear . He actually curled his lip , Upstairs , speakers talked to the enthusiastic crowd while Betty sat at a table , nervously fiddling with toothpicks , looking very , very tired . When it was her turn , she began by - reminiscing about the early days of the women 's movement . " We were not empresses or queens or Marie Curie , " she said . " We were from Peoria Betty is originally from Peoria ) . " We realized we had to create the movement . out of our own experience . We did n't have the corporate or athletic experience that men do . But we spoke the truth of the condition of women . And we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakthrough toward human equality . We made it so people have to confront their destinies , not just as mothers and fathers , but as people in a society . " But now there is this terrible sense of emergency . And we must all pay our dues . If we do n't , what we worked for will be taken away from us . If the ERA is blocked , it will be the end of the dream for equality in this century . " After her speech , she sat at a table in the back of the room , her face heavy with fatigue . Women came to ask for her autograph , They told her over and over , " You changed my life . " One woman said , " You 've inspired me more than anyone to do something for myself . " Betty thanked her and told her she must work to bring political pressure to help pass the ERA . " Well , I would , " the woman said , " but I 'm not a registered voter . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
