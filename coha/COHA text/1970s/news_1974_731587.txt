txt FIDEL CASTRO has been a persona non grata to the official faction of the United States for more than a decade . But the 12-year tiff may be easing and Americans once again will grow to know the bearded Cuban leader who has done for combat fatigues what Churchill did for cigars . One glimpse we may get of Fidel may arrive by courtesy of Italian actress Gina Lollobrigida , who made a film with Fidel as the star during a recent visit to Cuba . The hour-long flick , " A Portrait of Fidel , " is to be shown on television abroad and in the United States . At least , that 's what Gina hopes , The film was her first attempt at directing and it got rather complicated because she also interviewed Fidel in the film . " I was in front and in back of the camera at the same time , " Gina said . The actress said she would like to pursue directing and also photography , ' which , at 47 , she has turned into a second career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the most interesting men in the world , " among them Henry Kissinger , Salvador Dalt , and Aristotle Onassis . " I prefer photography or directing ? with them it 's more complete than just Jack Mabley 's column is on page J. being an actor , " Gina said . But she wo n't be missing from the screen entirely . " Unfortunately , I accepted some film propositions , " she said . Last week 's conviction of Aldermen Thomas Keane and Paul Illgoda , powerful Democratic princelings who got caught with their hands out , ' .. ould n't seem to be a joking matter for fellow Democrats . But Secretary of State Michael Howlett , a more ebullient type tha , , some of his fellow party leaders , gave it the old try at a birthday dinner for Sen. Stevenson last Thursday night . " If you pay attention , we 'll get out of here fast , " Howlett told the crowd . " If you do not pay- attention , you will not be eligible for a pardon . " The response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly safer subjects . After one speaker suggested that Stevenson might one day be President , Howlett turned to Gov . Walker , who also was at the speaker 's table , and said : " Now that we 've elected Stevenson President , Dan , it looks like you 're going to have to be Pope . " That one cheered things up a little bit . Antiwar celebrities Jane Fonda and Daniel Ellsberg. traveling together on a national speaking tour opposing American aid to Indochina , stopped briefly in Detroit and talked about something else . Noting that her husband Toni Hayden was born in nearby Huntington Woods , Ms. Fonda remarked that he had stayed in Santa Monica , Cal. , to care for their is-month-old son Trot , whose name means Heaven in Vietnamese . " He 's a great father , " she said . " He loves baseball and spends hours trying to teach Trol to throw the ball . " Said Ellsberg : " I was n't allowed to touch a baseball .

Now that he he s more time on his hands , daughter Julie Eisenhower said , he has begun watching more television . Appearing as cohost of the Mike Douglas Show , Julie reported that Ralph Keyes . a former writer for Laugh-In , prepared a list of the best shows for Nixon to watch . His favorite , she added , is the law and order series Kojak . If President Nixon seems to have more time on his hands , Rep. Peter J. Rodin of New Jersey certainly has less . Today he is no longer just another face in the political crowd , and invitations  --  such as the one he accepted to participate in Chicago 's Columbus Day Monday  --  are pouring into his office . " Face it , I 'm a human being , " he said of public reaction to his chairmanship of the House Judiciary Committee impeachment hearings . " These plaudits are satisfying .
