The Palestinians , Poet Mahmoud Darweesh once wrote , are a people who have " no homeland , no flag and no address . " But they do have a strong sense of nationhood . Even children who have never been there talk vividly about life in the Old City of Jerusalem or the beauty of Mount Carmel and the orange groves of Jaffa . In part , the Palestinians ' collective memory of homeland and the dream of return are kept alive by a large body of nostalgic Arabic poetry , written by angry young lyricists who know both the harshness of Israeli prisons and the despair of life in refugee camps . Some of these Palestinian " songs of liberation " : <P> THE IMPOSSIBLE <P> It is much easier for you To pass an elephant through a needle 's eye , Or catch fried fish in a galaxy , Plough the sea , Force a crocodile to speak Than to destroy by persecution The shimmering glow of a belief , Or check our march , One single step . <P> As if we were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Galilee ... Here we shall stay , A wall upon your breast , And in your throat we shall stay , A piece of glass , a cactus thorn , And in your eyes , A blazing fire . - Tawfiq Zayad <P> <P> LOVER FROM PALESTINE <P> I saw you on thorny hills A sheepless shepherd-chased I saw you on the ruins and once You were a green orchard I stood a stranger Knocking at your door The doors , the windows , the cemented stone Vibrated . <P> I saw your face in the wells In the granaries-torn I saw you a waitress in the night cafes I saw through the tears and wounds And you are the words on my lips You are the fire- And the water . <P> I saw you at the mouth of a cave Hanging your orphan 's rags I saw you in the stalls , in the streets Warming your self by the fire I saw you in the lamentations of misery In blood dripping from the sun In the salt of the sea and the sand and yet You were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From my eyelashes I shall weave you A kerchief With words sweeter than honey And kisses I shall write : Palestinian you were And so you will remain . - Mahmoud Darweesh <P> <P> LETTER FROM PRISON <P> Mother , It pains me , mother , That you burst in tears When friends knock , Asking about me . <P> But I believe , Mother , That the splendor of life Is born in my prison ; And I believe that My final visitor Will not be an eyeless bat . <P> It shall be the day . It shall be the day . - Sameeh al-Qassem <P> <P> AN ADDRESS <P> She asked : " Where lives the ' Prince ' ? " Then , I stood silenced For I had no address , l am a man in transit , Twenty years in transit A man who was even deprived The right of having an address . - Rashid Hussein
