txt President Carter 's inner circle of advisers has gone on the offensive to convey the hard news to the Federal bureaucracy and major Democratic Party constituencies that Mr. Carter 's commitment to a tighter 1980 budget will mean not only delaying new programs but also cutting back on existing ones . High-level Administration officials report that , while no final decisions have been made , Cabinet departments have already been ordered to cut about $15 billion out of the normal growth of a range of programs , including Social Security disability insurance , Medicare , Medicaid , the water and sewer program of the Environmental Protection Agency , the Labor Department 's public service jobs programs , and even some of the automatic cost-ofliving increases for the Federal employ . ees ' retirement programs . These cuts will be necessary to hold the budget deficit to $30 billion for the fiscal year beginning next Oct. 1 . A number of officials expect sharp battles when some of the necessary legislation hits Congress next year . But Hamilton Jordan , Mr. Carter 's unofficial chief of staff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision in making inflation his top target , knowing full well that it would bring protests from various groups within his own party . Aware of Consequences " I do n't think anybody is more award than the President of the political consequences of the course he 's chosen to take , " Mr. Jordan told reporters at a breakfast meeting . " The best answer , maybe the only answer , is that he 's willing to pay the price along the way . Somebody 's got to say No , and the President 's going to do It . You ca n't have it both ways . You ca n't please all these people and still fight inflation . " Both Mr. Jordan and Stuart Eizenstat , i the President 's top staff adviser on domestic policy who spoke today at the National Press Club , acknowledged that the anti-inflation campaign had altered the Administration 's priorities and that even some of its own favored programs would be affected . " As compared to a year ago , it 's a new ball game , " Mr. Jordan declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be reviewed under the new constraints , even things we have come up with before . We have to slide some dates back and put together a more modest legislative agenda . " Other officials said they expected the President 's welfare program , originally // scheduled to come into operation in the fiscal year 1982 at a cost of $20 billion , to be cut back to less than $10 billion , even though it would not directly affect the 1980 budget . Another forecast was for a sharp cut in the $1 billion labor intensive public works program that was part of the Administration 's urban plan and failed to win Congressional passage this year . On national health insurance , some officials said they expected that the Administration 's program might be'limited to aid to the elderly , to children and to those needing care for catastrophic illness . At present , roughly one-third of the $15 billion cutback is slated to come out of programs run by the Department of Health , Education and Welfare , including Medicaid and Medicare and the Social Security disability insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Administration is hopeful that H.E.W . can realize significant savings on Medicaid and Medicare if hospital cost increases can be held below the recent 15 percent rate of inflation . The message of austerity was conveyed by the President himself yesterday in a speech to several hundred top subCabinet officials , and by Anne Wexler , a White House aide , who warned a gathering of 1,300 top city officials and planners from across the country of the " scarce resources " in the upcoming Federal budget . Mr. Carter minced few words in telling the Federal agency managers that he wanted the 1980 budget " stripped of every degree of waste and inefficiency possible to detect . " He urged them not to let their narrow agency responsibilities induce them to put the special interests of their own programs above the general interest of fighting inflation . Despite the expected unpopularity of cutbacks in existing programs , Mr. ' Jordan suggested that fiscal austerity was a " politically wise " strategy with the country now in a conservative mood on government spending . " If there 's any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1976 Presidential election , it is that the American people do n't want more government , " Mr. Jordan asserted . " They want better government . " Strength of Protests Unknown But other officials are fearful that too little is known about the impending cutbacks to gauge how strong the protests will be . " Everybody realizes there 's going to be a crunch , but people have n't focused in on how real a crunch it 's going to be , " said a ranking official in one domestic agency . " You have n't seen the reaction of constituent groups yet . This approach does really raise profound questions about how the President is , going to run for re-election . I do n't have the feeling yet that the White House has calculated where the counterpressures are going to come , where the yells and screams are going to come , when people begin to see cuts in benefits that they expect . " A number of ranking officials believe that Mr. Carter is likely to compound his political problems , particularly with liberal Democrats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal of the Atlantic alliance to increase the defense budget by 3 percent above inflation . Much of the Administration 's sense of tension over the budget arises from the fact that at least three-quarters of the Federal expenditures are known as " uncontrollables " ? programs fixed in law with expenditures rising each year with inflation . To cut them requires changing the laws that govern their benefits and operations . Without cutbacks , Administration experts expect that the cost of " current services " ? simply continuing existing programs ? will rise to $546 billion in the 1980 fiscal year that starts next Oct. 1 . Revenues are estimated at just over WO billion , meaning a projected deficit of about $-15 billion unless cutbacks are made . Thus , Mr. Carter 's declared intention to hold the deficit down to $30 billion requires cutbacks of roughly $15 billion .
