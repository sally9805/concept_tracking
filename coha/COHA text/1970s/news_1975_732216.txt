txt " Cut , cut ! " moaned the director of a museum that receives substantial city funds . " We ca n't cut back any more . If we lose a few more guards , we 'll have to go to a no-day week . " As with other city agencies , the crisis that has brought New York to the brink of bankruptcy is deeply affecting its cultural institutions and their services to the public . Within the last year , members of the Cultural Institutions Group , 18 of the 26 facilities that get significant financing from the city , have had their budgets cut by an average of 10 per cent . The resulting loss of personnel has forced them to close exhibition halls , keep shorter public hours , curtail sanitation procedures and further expose their holdings to theft and vandalism . Concern Over Closing Now there is more grim news : a further cut of 8.5 per cent to take effect Friday , compounded by the prospect of default , with an attendant personnel cutback that could force many institutions to close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconceivable that some cultural institutions will leave the city . It is , in fact , reported that other cities have indicated interest in acquiring both performing arts organizations and museum collections . Most of New York City 's contribution to the budgets of these institutions is allotted for guards and maintenance , and in taking the cuts the institutions are continually having to redeploy their thinning ranks of service employes . From the $1.82 million in support given the Brooklyn Museum for fiscal // Last October , a Committee on Cultural Policy headed by Mr. Segal made a report to the , Mayor indicating that cultural , and artistic activities in the ; city generated over $3 billion a , year in receipts and expenditures , and contributed $102 million in tax revenues . Mr. Segal and members of the Cultural Institutions group have also castigated the New York State Council on the Arts for its delay in restoring a portion of the more than $1.6 million cut it made this year in its appropriation for city-supported institutions . " Every day that goes by without restoration of these cuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating budget of $21 million to the brink of incredible probis resulting in cuts in " people , lems , " says Mr. Segal . hours , and the closing of some Joan K.

" We have been suffering with attrition for four years , " he continued , " but within these last four months , 200 people were laid off in the branch libraries . " Federal funds from the Comprehensive Employment Training Act allowed the library to hire back 58 employes several weeks later , but the Nov. 7 cuts will bring to 10 percent the total reduction of the library staff of some 3,000 employes . Cuts have also been made in the city money that goes to the Department of Cultural Affairs of the Parks , Recreation and Culture Administration to finance summer programs in the parks and boroughs by such organizations as the Metropolitan Opera Company , the New York Philharmonic , Jazzmobile , the New York Shakespeare Fes- , tival and a large number of tiny groups to whom city financing means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without closing to the public , " says Joseph Veach Noble , the museum 's director . " Our cleaning and maintenance personnel normally did work on Mondays when the museum is closed . Now , we 've let six go and the others , numbering about 30 , have to do the cleaning on mornings and weekends , when the attendance is heaviest . " Desperate Plight A much smaller facility , the Wave Hill Center for Environmental Studies in the Riverdale section of the Bronx , finds itself in a more desperate plight . A former estate recently reopened to the public after extensive renovation , Wave Hill runs an " environmental awareness program " on its 28-acre grounds for schoolchildren and the general public . Its cultivated gardens and nature trails have been maintained by seven gardeners , but a cut in city funds from $170,000 in fiscal 1974-75 to $150,000 in fiscal 1975-76 has reduced the number to five .

" The council has repeatedly expressed its distress and concern over the plight of the cultural institutions , " he said . " The zoos , the botanical gardens and the museums know that more money is coming to them from the council and reasonably soon , because we most likely will have resolved the per capita obligation within the next few weeks . " early this spring a cut of $40 , - 000 reduced the sum for fiscal 1975-76 to $3,162,500 . So far , the $200,000 allotted for the 80
