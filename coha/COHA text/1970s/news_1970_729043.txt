txt In his 26 years on the bench , Justice Mitchell D. Schweitzer of the State Supreme Court has set records for the swift disposition of cases . Because of his efficiency , seniority and reputation for having a keen legal mind , he is widely regarded as one of the most influential judges in New York State . But whether Justice Schweitzer has always acted with propriety and in conformity with the Canons of Judicial Ethics has been under investigation by Federal and state officials ever since they learned last year that he was a close friend of Nathan Voloshen . Volo ? =1 , , n Ity last June to conspiracy to defraud Federal agencies and is to be sentenced Nov. 24 . During the last two months , an independent investigation by The New York Times explored several cases involving Justice Schweitzer , which also are under study by ' Whitney North Seymour Jr. , United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York , and the State Joint Legislative Committee on Crime . Neither Mr. Seymour nor Senator John Hughes , chairman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee felt that issues raised in its investigation were serious enough to turn its records over to Presiding Justice Harold A. Stevens , of the Appellate Division , First Department , for possible action , although Justice Schweitzer has not been accused of any crime . Justice Stevens declined to comment on the case . Information emerging from the investigations focuses on the following : ' Justice Schweitzer 's relaC , ntintied on Page 51 , Colonin 2 Justice Schweitzer Under Inquiry by State Legislative Committee and U.S. time in mid-1967 Justice Schweitzer met privately with William Jaffe , a prominent lawyer who is Robert Friede 's stepfather , to discuss the young addict . In a chauffeured Rolls-Royce , Mr. Jaffe drove from New York at the invitation of Justice Schweitzer to the justice 's home , which was then at 101 Catherine Avenue , Scarsdale , and talked for more than an hour with him . Shortly afterward the late Harris Steinberg , the lawyer who represented Friede , wrote a letter to State Parole Commissioner Russell G. Oswald . He said in the letter that Justice ' Schweitzer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented a good risk for parole as soon as he became eligible . Friede was paroled on Nov. 13 , 1967 , and is now living in the State of Washington . A Prison Transfer Asked on the telephone about his visit to Justice Schweitzer 's home , Mr. Jaffe said that do n't have time for such things " and hung up . Justice Schweitzer figures in several other Cases under official investigation . One concerns a young man named Corey Feldman , who was sentenced in Nassau County to up to five years at the Elmira reformatory in November , 1969 , for robbing a drugstore . " Only this time , " the magazine said , " the judge sentenced Bello to a shorter term , which made him eligible for immediate release . Bello thereupon walked out of the courtroom a free man .

After serving , the sentence for unlawful entry , Freda , moved through Mr. Reiben for resentencing on the two remaining counts . On April 11 , 1969 , the case appeared on Justice Schweitzer 's calendar and he ordered a stay on .

In one of these cases Justice Schweitzer reversed his own ruling . CHis role in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another . The first investigation into the conduct of Justice Schweitzer was started in the fall of 1969 by Robert M. Morgenthau , then the United States Attorney for the Southern District , and it was continued by his successor , Mr. Seymour . A separate inquiry started later by the State Joint Legislative Committee on Crime questioned Justice Schweitzer , and several persons linked to him , in closed hearings last June . Justice Schweitzer 's lawyer , Bernard Botein , a retired presiding justice of the Appellate Division , said in a reply to a written request to the justice for an interview to discuss the cases under investigation : " We are of the opinion that under the circumstances , the participation in such an interview of Justice Schweitzer would be highly improper at Ice Schweitzer met with him at least five times . The meetings took place in the apartment of Harvey and Shirley Axelrod at 1160 Third Avenue . Mr. and Mrs. Axelrod are old friends of Voloshen . After Voloshen 's dealings were disclosed last year , he abandoned his office at 5 West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's place of business , Carlson Originals , 512 Seventh Avenue , to receive and make calls . Mr. Axelrod refused to discuss any aspect of his contacts with Justice Schweitzer or Voloshen. more pleasant surroundings of Green Haven . This was unusual because transfers from reformatories to prisons are not a matter of course , according to officials . Furthermore , Feldman 's father , Morton , says he got in touch with Justice Schweitzer , and the judge has acknowledged that he took some action in the case . The contact between Morton Feldman and Justice Schweitzer was made early in 1968 . Shortly afterward Justice Schweitzer phoned State Correction Commissioner Paul D. and asked him to give favorable consideration to a transfer for young Feldman . Mr. says he has no record of a call from Justice Schweitzer , but adds that he does not keep a record of all calls he receives on behalf of inmates . Justice Schweitzer , however , has told investigators that he did call Mr. . It is not unusual for prisoners ' relatives to seek ' help from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the vast majority " go to the judge who sentenced the defendants in the first place , not to a different judge in a different county . Another Discrepancy There is a final mystery about the Feldman case . Morton Feldman and Justice Schweitzer tell different stories about how the father contacted the judge . Mr. Feldman has told investigators he never met Justice Schweitzer but merely wrote him asking for help for his son . The justice , on the other hand , has told investigators he had dinner with Morton Feldman and his wife . Justice Schweitzer often meets friends and colleagues for dinner at expensive restaurants . One of his many wealthy friends is Louis Seeman , president of an umbrella manufacturing company in Man hattan , who has maintained an apartment at the Drake Hotel since 1965 at an annual rental or more than $10,000 . Justice Schweitzer has used the apartment often , entertain'ing friends there and paying for drinks and dinner by signing Mr. Seeman 's name , apparently with Mr. Seeman 's knowledge . As far as is known , Mr. Seeman has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , major dealings with the law at all . When he testified before a Federal grand ) jury last year and was questioned about his friendship with Justice Schweitzer , he refused to answer on the grounds of possible self-incrimination . Justice Schweitzer lives in a cooperative apartment at 785 Fifth Avenue . As a State . Supreme Court justice his salary is $39,100 a year , and he is said to earn about an equal amount from his investments . He is 65 and married to the former Sylvia Brandt , and they have three sons , all in their twenties . He was graduated from Columbia Law School and maintained a private practice until 1944 , when he was elected a Municipal Court justice . In 1954 , with the backing of both the Democratic and Liberal parties , he was elected to General Sessions Court , which was later merged into State Supreme Court . His power comes from his seniority . Although judges theoretically are supposed to rotate assignments , in practice those with the most seniority have been allowed to pick their own spots . Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are heard , where defendants who plead guilty are sentenced and where lawyers are assigned to represent indigent defendants at the state 's expense . On at least two occasions Justice Schweitzer met with lawyers of clients who later came before him and won releases from prison . The cases of the inmates were discussed at both meetings , although the prosecution was not represented . Voloshen was present , however . One meeting was held at the Orangerie restaurant in Manhattan and included a lawyer named Henry Blumenthal in addition to Justice Schweitzer and Voloshen . Mr. Blumenthal was then representing Manuel Bello , a gangster linked by Federal officials to the Mafia . Bello was serving 15 to 30 months in prison for trying to dispose of $100,000 in stolen securities . Life magazine reported last mean to kill Miss Crenshaw and pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter , possession of narcotics and , violation of probation . Second-degree manslaughter is punishable by up to 15 years , but Friede had a previous felony conviction and faced a sentence of up to 30 years .

Nineteen months later Friede was out on parole . Justice Schweitzer 's sentencing of Friede did not end his involvement in the case .
