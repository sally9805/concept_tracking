txt In the pink-walled main foyer of the Kiev Palace of Weddings a dense crowd has gathered , including three brides in white dresses , three bridegrooms in dark suits , and an assortment of witnesses , parents , and best men . They jostle impatiently until a woman 's voice over a loudspeaker says : " The Scherbakov party shall proceed to the Hall of Weddings . " Part of the group surges to the stairway as the loudspeaker blares forth with a painfully tired , scratchy recording of Mendelssohn 's Wedding March . Upstairs , meanwhile , another party is moving from the waiting room to the Hall of Weddings , a third party is being hustled from the Hall of Weddings to a small room where a waiter is pouring champagne , and yet a fourth party is hurrying downstairs to jump into one of the white rented Volga sedans lined up at the curb . " GREAT IlEAVENS , " murmurs an American guest as he surveys the scene . " They run it like a car wash . " Perhaps so , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremony by which the state gives its proletarian blessing to the cohabitation of men and women . The Scherbakovs , Yuri and Tanya , both 24 and both graduate engineers , were one couple Newlyweds Yuri and Tanya Scherbakov of several dozen who were wed in such circumstances recently in the Ukrainian capital . And they were one couple of about two million who embark on the thorny path of marriage each year in the Soviet Union . TIIERE IS A GOOD chance the marriage will be shorter than the courtship . Among the problems they may face are early divorce , no place to live . fights with in-laws , job conflicts , and hard feelings over housework . The most recent figures put the divorce rate at one for every 3.5 marriages , and everybody has his opinion on why it is so high . One cause commonly cited is the fact that a divorce in the Soviet Union Is ridiculously easy to get . Judges may accept any reasonable grounds , from adultery to simple boredom , and legal costs are nominal . Judges usually make some effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they routinely grant the divorce . A SECOND MAJOR cause Is the severe housing shortage that often leaves couples living with one set of parents or even sleeping in separate apartments . The tensions and frictions of living apart , or living with in-laws , can easily kill a young marriage . If a couple are lucky enough to get a private apartment for themselves , they still must face a myriad of forces that tend to push them apart . In the Soviet Union nearly all women work , and their career ambitions can take their lives in a direction different from that of their husbands . And more and more Soviet wives are becoming impatient with their halfliberated situation , in which they work alongside men but still are expected to do the housework that was the lot of their mothers . Finally , should the marriage survive all the early blows aimed at It , it may well turn out to be a childless union . With husband and wife working , couples find children to be a hardship and they strive to limit family size . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have only one or two children , or none at all . FAMILY PLANNING is Incredibly simple in the Soviet Union . There is virtually no stigma associated with contraceptives or aborLion , both of which are extremely inexpensive , so couples have no difficulty in keeping ' the family small . So why get married at all ? Many Soviet citizens do not . One man in four between the ages of 25 and 30 is a bachelor , and if a girl does not find a mate before ago 30 she has a 00 per cent probability of remaining a spinster for life . So when the worn-out Mendelssohn recording sounds in the Palace of Weddings it signals the start of a gamble . But Tanya and Yuri are not thinking of that as they are summoned to the tall white doorway of the Hall of Weddings . They hold hands , and whisper nervously as the door opens . INSIDE , A deputy of tho Kiev Soviet , a short , heavy-breasted woman wearing a ceremonial red sash over her skirt and sweater outfit , waits at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to one side stands an enormous , white bust of Vladimir I. Lenin whose , stone gaze is directed at the spot where the wedding couple takes its place . The lady deputy greets them with , " Dear Comrades , " and she delivers a brief speech about the duties of marriage in a Socialist society , and the need for love between men and women . Then Tanya and Yuri sign the registry on the deputy 's desk , and the witnesses sign too . The couple exchange gold rings , and the lady deputy , smiling , proclaims : " BY VIE authority of the Kiev Soviet of Workers ' Deputies , I now pronounce you man and wife . " Yuri and Tanya kiss , their friends present them with flowers and more kisses , and they are shown out of the room while the tired old Mendelssohn recording scratches its way once more thru the Wedding March . The Scherbakovs may be standing before a divorce judge in a year 's time , and they may be quarreling over In-laws sooner that that , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place to sleep together for the next week . BUT THEY are not worried about that now . After all , the bride is lovely , and the bridegroom is handsome . The ladles cry , the young men kiss the bride . And , the Mendelssohn recording aside , it is a beautiful wedding .
