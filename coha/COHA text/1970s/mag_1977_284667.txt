The Phil Woods Six ( RCA , 2 LPs ) . <P> In addition to being the sweetest saxophone player ( soprano and alto ) this side of Stan Getz , Phil Woods is one of the toughest , most durable jazz masters . Originally a follower of Charlie ( " Bird " ) Parker , Woods has survived the ups and downs of decades of jazz with a personal style that has never lost its passion or ingenuity . In this extended set , recorded during performance last November at the Showboat Lounge , Silver Spring . Md. , he fronts a six-man combo working the mainstream of jazz today . Standard tunes are blended enticingly with originals by Pianist Mike Melillo , Guitarist Harry Leahey and Woods himself , and there is even a breathtaking moto perpetuo treatment of I 'm Late from the Disney Alice in Wonderland . How that rabbit runs ! <P> Dickey Betts &; Great Southern ( Arista ) . The Allman Brothers Band may have broken up , mostly over the drug and marital problems of Lead Vocalist Gregg Allman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betts &; Co . Betts , whose song writing and soaring guitar solos helped gun the Allman band 's engine , keeps his foot to the floor with his new group 's debut album . The music moves from hard shakers like Run Gypsy Run to tender love songs like Bougainvillea . <P> Jesse Winchester : Nothing but a Breeze ( Bearsville ) . " Me , I want to live with my feet in Dixie/ And my head in the cool blue North , " sings Jesse Winchester on the title cut of his fifth album . Although he is now a Canadian citizen , having gone north to avoid the draft a decade ago , Winchester has never forsaken his Tennessee roots . His folkish simplicity and Southern warmth go down like good country cider-easily , and with an occasional gentle kick . <P> Van Morrison : A Period of Transition ( Warner Bros . ) . On his first album in three years , Morrison is neither the rock ' n ' roller of his early Belfast days , nor the melismatic improviser he has been through much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streetgritty rhythm and blues , and Morrison is backed up by New Orleans Gumbo Rocker Mac ( " Dr. John " ) Rebennack , who is the album 's keyboard player and coproducer . Somewhat weakened by repetitiveness ( one bit of business is repeated 38 times ) , the record has little meat but plenty of motion . <P> Chick Corea : My Spanish Heart ( Polydor , 2 LPs ) . Armando Anthony ( " Chick " ) Corea ranks among the most adventurous and dexterous jazz pianist-composers . Since parting with Miles Davis in 1970 , Corea has built an ever-increasing following , largely through the rock-oriented stylings of his group , Return to Forever . Here , Corea steps adroitly through an assortment of Spanish dance rhythms and folk tunes ( with some Latin and African thrown in ) and produces a tour de force that the pop-music lover should enjoy as much as the jazz buff .
