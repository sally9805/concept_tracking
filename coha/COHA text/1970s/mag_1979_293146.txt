The day began with strawberry tarts , fresh orange juice and a Dixieland band . Fine priming for the nearly 1,200 people , most of whom had paid $250 ( applicable to any later purchase ) to attend a three-day auction billed as " the greatest collection of architectural antiques ever offered for sale by anyone-anywhere-at any time . " Assembled under six tents and a former Two Guys store in a remote corner of Los Angeles were , roughly counting , 4,000 windows , doors , ceilings , entryways and greenhouses of stained , beveled and etched glass , 200 paneled rooms , bars , pubs and shop interiors , and more than 100 mantels , inglenooksand " other miscellany . " <P> It was the ninth auction put on by John P. Wilson , 40 , a former precision-instruments salesman who switched to the nostalgia industry nine years ago , when he turned an unexpectedly tidy profit on a surplus lot of 1,000 old pull-chain toilets -a $100,000 windfall now memorialized in the name of his company : Golden Movement Emporium . <P> The crowd around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old railroad baggage carts-admiringly described Wilson as " the P.T. Barnum of the auction business . " Barnum , it will be remembered , held it true that " there is a sucker born every minute . " To encourage five-figure bids , Wilson provided shuttle buses , disposable toothbrushes in rest rooms , free phones , simultaneous translation for a group of 25 Japanese , and $300,000 worth of frankly fabulous food catered by Los Angeles Restaurateur Robert J. Morris . The wine flowed like water , and so did the Perrier . " I think it 's a goddam hoot , " grinned a Texan , as a forklift truck rolled past bearing 1,200 live Maine lobsters . <P> It was part circus , part revival meeting , part convention . Most of the paying guests , according to Wilson , were hotel and shopping-center people and " the Who 's Who of the theme-restaurant business . " Theme restaurants have nothing to do with Ye Olde Tea Shoppes . These days quaint is a growth industry . Houlihan 's Old Place , for example , has grown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a national chain of 18 restaurants , featuring stained glass , antique kitsch and rock music . Recently bought by W.R. Grace , Houlihan 's will open ten new restaurants this year at a cost of $1 million each . Part of Houlihan 's decorating inventory , two warehouses full , came from Wilson 's earlier auctions .
