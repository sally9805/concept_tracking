HAMM ARSKJOLD <P> by BRIAN URQUHART 597 pages . Knopf. $12.50 . <P> <P> Brian Urquhart is not the first to make the point that the United Nations did not work out as originally planned . But in this book , a comprehensive political analysis of Dag Hammarskjld 's seven years as the U.N . ' s Secretary-General , Urquhart for the first time chronicles in precise detail how close one man often came to making the curious organization do what it was supposed to . The author has worked for the U.N . since its inception and is now an Assistant Secretary-General . He is also the first man to be given access to Hammarskjld 's private papers . He sees the former Secretary-General as a man supremely equipped with the inner resources , courage , stamina and imperturbable tact to make the U.N . work . The book uses considerable inside knowledge as it follows Hammarskjld through every major crisis of his day : McCarthyism , the aftermath ot Korea , Suez , Hungary , Lebanon , Algeria , the Congo . <P> In each the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pope , " was quick to assert the authority of the world organization . At the height of the Suez crisis in ' 56 , he dictated the first three pages of a plan for a special emergency force during lunch , had it completed before dinner . Over British and French vetoes in the Security Council and a Soviet offer to deploy its own troops , he managed to get it ratified by a majority of the General Assembly . U.N.E.F. was his most successful innovation . It served as the model for international forces in the Congo and Cyprus . It also more or less kept the lid on the Middle East for ten years . <P> Hammarskjld did not often get his way , of course . There was little the U.N . could do about Khrushchev 's brutal repression of the Hungarian uprising . <P> Even in such a relatively benign matter as the release of eleven U.S. flyers shot down over China during the Korean War , John Foster Dulles first urged Hammarskjld to intervene , then refused to allow their families to travel to Peking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flyers ' release was delayed eight months .

Because the theme of the book is Hammarskjld in action , the forces that so often frustrated him do not receive enough analysis . <P> Nor does the fundamental dilemma from which the U.N . and its Secretary-General have increasingly suffered : <P> how to create from the original consensus by the nations of the world that the U.N . should exist , a power strong enough to constrain the power of any one of them . <P> Friedel Ungeheuer
