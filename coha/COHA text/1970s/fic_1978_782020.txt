 | ( which opens , then , into long fingers of roads out into the woods , the meadows , up those hills impossible in winter ) . Hallie and Jon call out at every landmark they remember , as though they 've expected it all to have vanished since summer : the bank , the town hall with its green screen door , summer and winter , the little pillared library with a fresh sign listing its hours ; these are silent as murals or backless movie sets , the whole length of Main Street swept by some giant machinery . The sky is just darkening at the flute end . Dan feels as if they are stealing back home . He turns up the hill towards their house . The trees are not quite in bud , the best of spring still coiled , waiting , and they will have it . Mill Road winds through that barrenness that lies between New England seasons , in which only a primitive trust leads from day to day into a lusher season . All the houses need paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter , lawns barely beginning to push up green out of their pallor ; the blacktop is wavy as surf with frost heaves . But the car makes its way as automatically as any horse that smells home . " Lorelei , " he says , turning his head an instant , " almost . " " Fedders got a goat ! " Jon cries as they come up the final turn . " Look what 's eating out there . " The neighbors do have a small grey goat who stands with his delicate head down facing their house from across the road , half on lawn , half on pasture . He does not look up as they slow . " One bump , hon , " Dan calls out cheerfully in warning . " Driveway 's never going to grow back , is it ? " Which was once a joke about the scourged surface of the little incline whose broken tar and stones , gravel and grass could make one seasick . Laura grunts in the back of the car at what is no longer funny : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Dan thinks it either appealing or therapeutic not to  | indulge such delicacy . He does not believe that she ought to be hurt by remarks . " Hurt is hurt enough , I 'd think . " And then says what he pleases . The car stops in the gravel with a lurch of finality . He opens the door for the kids and they scamper out , fly up like birds and are gone around behind the house : they have their hundred secret places to check out . He squats down at the doorway to the back seat and smiles . " Okay . " She makes no sound or movement where she sits propped between pillows like a Russian princess in a carriage ; absence is one of her only remaining defenses . He understands it , has no right to an opinion of it , deplores it , mocks it , and is angry . " Alone " was one of the first words that had come back to her . Whichever it was , complaint or plea , it left him out . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her children darting like barn swallows all around their house , yipping giddily , reporting , too far away to be understood , on the state of the rabbit warren and the chicken coop , the fallen clematis vine and the hole in the tree that 's full up with starling babies  --  she stares straight ahead and gives no evidence of knowing or caring where she is. - " I 'm going in , " he tells her , more sharply than he 'd intended . " Do you want to stay here while I have a look around ? " She has the capacity not to blink . Sometimes it is clear to him that it is easier for her not to give a sign of life than to give any at all . That giving anything is what she resolutely will not do . Her small head with its raggedy boy 's haircut ? nurses ' convenience , one more retribution  --  stays inclined precisely where it is . " Well , all right , " he says to her , and stands . " Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He goes down the walk briskly , half for spite , half excited by the feel of the blue-  | grey-pink flagstones and the little rise of the doorstep . He wants to shout like the children , one huge whoop of greeting . For Laura he is quiet . Then how peculiar and painful , to walk across the threshold of his own house and to reclaim it from the anonymous care of strangers . The kitchen has a faintly unfamiliar feel to it  --  not a feel , a smell , an odd tinge of apples and fresh paint that lodges far back in his nose , bitter and flat with an overlay of sweetness . And light . Laura 's white curtains are tied back to let in what dim late afternoon brightness can penetrate the lilac bush , even out of bloom . The floor 's not buffed , there is a great expanse of dulled tile linoleum lying under a scum of grey soapiness . It 's all right , though : not abused , he can see at the door that the couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did their best , and a decent best , to keep things in shape . He 'd have to write and thank them , back in Maryland or wherever it is they come from . But they were not Dan and Laura , Jon and Hallie Lavender , who had spent the worst year of anybody 's life , just now , in New York City , and so the house looks distant , untouchable , separate from him . He remembers all of it , knows every corner , but still it floats just out of reach , like a friend who has been changed by a year of unshared experience . The long wooden living room must always have been this dark . The fireplace is so empty of ashes he winces . Nobody cleans a fireplace like that  --  maybe they lived in a " garden apartment " ( he 'd discovered the genre just this year ) or the kind with an elevator . Had they done all the good things on the hearth that made it so valuable ? Bingo with the kids , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Love , one side of you tanning against the fire , after the kids were in bed ; then love again , spectacular comfort in the warm hollow of light with the room chilly outside it , because there was that extra  | excitement , waiting to get caught by Jon or Hallie tiptoeing down , and you two naked on the wide granite gravestone . Hearthstone . Jesus . Every other word is crooked these days , as if he were Laura whose prepositions were blasted to hell the first few months . ( Who could believe they lived in a place in your brain  --  at , to , in , out  --  like pollen in flowers , ants on sugar ; could be scooped , tweezed , scratched , stolen ? And then grow back ? They had met a man , in the hospital , who had lost the number 6 . ) He had brought her flowers yesterday when he came to tell her they were going home . On the card he had meant to write Bon Voyage but it was twisted too : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His brain in sympathy with hers . But she had laughed for the first time in a long time at that . Upstairs the bedrooms are so clean , the effort that has gone into leaving the house in good condition is so palpable it hangs in the air in place of the banished dust . They are very young , if he recalls right ( friends of friends of his sister ) , and they are free of children , of responsibilities , of endless obligation  --  why did they feel bound to be so meticulous ? Pity , probably , pity the great universal , the best and worst that strangers have to offer . Look , let 's make it as decent as possible so those poor people wo n't have to come back and begin cleaning up . The kind care taken : he could see the girl , she 'd be standing in the doorway with a broom , slender in her dungarees , and when she 'd bend down to sweep the dust into the pan her boyfriend ( or was he her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the front of her shirt ;  | he 'd say " Come on , leave all that " and she 'd poke the broom into his hands and say " You finish it , I 've got to pack . " Dan would have gone on spinning out the scene , he is dizzy with lust , with need , with broken energy , but he makes himself quit ; Laura is captive in the car and it is getting dark . On his way out , through the kitchen , he sees they 've left a note , one corner held under the vase of paper flowers on the table . It is a welter of small details and apology , the kinked washing machine hose and the cracked upstairs window ; it ends : Good luck , our prayers are with you and we know it will all work out . The Lallys . They are married then ; still he wo n't revise his imaginings , what would n't he give , twelve years married , to peer down the neck of Laura 's blouse right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurses had told him , shocked , when she overheard him whispering lewd daydreams in Laura 's ear . Undignified or impossible ? he asked her , furious . Does it make any difference ? she answered , fixing him with a narrow satisfied smile . And still he does n't know . ) As for the prayers part of the Lallys ' message .... His own friends , too , will congratulate him ( for returning ? surviving ? ) and be wary , both , and they will come as fast as they can to see Laura for themselves ; their eyes will hurt her , however kind . The more kind the more humiliating . No win , no win . How , Dan thinks , eager to sit down  --  he feels the way he does in the eighth inning of a double-header on a steamy August Sunday  --  how would it be if you 'd just come back from the war slightly wounded but decorated nonetheless , wearing the Purple Heart : dishonor , would you call it ? Honor by accident ? Relief , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , survival as the best you could make of bad news ? He is a man who has very nearly killed his wife , though that  | may not have been the story his friends had heard . He is a young , dark-haired , good-looking man who had taken the tiller of a boat he could n't manage , far from home , and had cut his wife in two . Somehow , somewhere . She was swimming over the starboard side . Shreds , one could say , absolute bloody spaghetti , his brother John had told them with a mean angry eye . Though his brother did n't like him , that old Courser clinch of love-hate , and they knew it . Still .. . The men will ask a lot of questions about the how and where of the winter and he 'll tell them about his job , they 'll laugh about taxi-driving in the jungle , how he 'd never even heard of Staten Island when he started . He 'll feed them bits and pieces of horror turned slightly comic , by time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in school , P.S. 197 , imagine 196 others just like it , not to mention four other boroughs ' worth which were like separate cities ten times the size of Manchester . And he 'd wonder what they are thinking , which would be just what everyone up to now had thought : Danny , Danny , good she was in a top-notch hospital , dedicated doctors , good , good , but who do you fuck ? How do you stand it ? And does she blame you , pretty Laura with her long brown hair and her dancer 's arches ? Not a single moving finger , can it be ? Cat-got-her-tongue-Laura , will she live , back in Hyland with her bedsores and her hospital fat , or will she die ? Or will she neither ? And then what ? He walks out through the clean , caretaken rooms , through late-afternoon light that makes tan squares on the kitchen floor like foursquare boxes to bounce a ball in . There are tissue-thin copies of oil bills , bills for propane and for the snow plow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a clothespin and suspended near the door : the heart of the house has gone on beating steadily without them , thriving on any life that came in off the flagstone path and claimed it . It  | measures its vitality by comings and goings , by feet crossing thresholds , water faucets turned on and off , left running nights , a charm against freezing ; by calls up the stairwells and out the upstairs windows over the apple trees . It does n't care whose voices they are , only life matters , human movement , warmth . This house is going to recoil from Laura 's presence now like some animal that can tell who intends to feed it , because she will never be able to touch it , to use and replenish it . The house is going to shrink around her . He opens the car door , pushes the front seat forward and discovers his wife in her very special state of tears ; she hunches there silent , a photograph of herself as a small boy , poised apparently forever , unmoving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . Louise , rolls of her , is a rose of a woman , she appears to have bloomed , opening outward , all her busy petals flopping around a lovely surprisingly small face , the flower 's pink heart . She is wearing a blue Peter Pan blouse and brown Bermuda shorts and apparently does not intend to stop smiling . Her husband has his new summer crewcut . He never smiles , it would violate his hidden flamboyance and theatricality to do anything so ordinary and undramatic . Louise is carrying a pot of forced daffodils of an unreal uniformity , fussing at the ruffle of gold foil paper in which they sit . Billy is bringing a six-pack , just in case Dan has n't had a chance to do the shopping yet . Louise talks a solid five minutes in the first minute , Billy says nothing but looks gravely around the room like a detective on duty . The Shurrocks are there ; they are Laura 's parents . The incomparable car sits out front with two wheels on the lawn . The Bickfords , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone home , but when cars drive up to the Coursers ' they are always heard , grinding on gravel . The dog barks . Dan knows everyone who goes past , his peculiar concentration allows him to see through walls out to the road . So , exchanging fatalistic looks , they have come in , trying to look eager . Eva Shurrock is seated at the table . Louise knows , from having " run into her " often , that Mrs. Shurrock tends to lag half a season behind in her dress , as if the effort it takes to be stylish exhausts her until well after it 's time to change again . It is a mild spring day  --  does n't Billy have his summer haircut already ? ? but she is wearing boots , elaborately laced , and she is chain smoking . She is one of those anxious total smokers who infects the entire area around herself with smoke and spilled tobacco and half-crushed butts with lipstick on them : very old-fashioned , Billy says . Probably her mother never let her smoke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies ' faces . Louise and Billy huddle in the doorway , watching the smoke from Eva Shurrock 's cigarette , which does not come and go but hangs there like fog in the riverbed on a warm morning . DeWitt Shurrock sits next to her , stealing surreptitious glances at the folded newspaper on the chair beside him . Dan appears to be trying to make the kind of cocktails they like ; he is failing . He pours more gin , and then more , into a glass full of tonic till it runs over the top of the glass . He tries to pour some into another glass but by now his hands are unsteady and there is a widening pool of gin on the sinktop that drips very slowly but noisily onto the linoleum and rolls down the slight slope of the old floor . The first flies of the season have begun to write their unreadable messages on the ceiling , loop over slow loop . They buzz him and stick their feet into the puddle of gin and tonic . They shake their  | frail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the glasses with the dishrag . " Oh , do n't use that on the floor , Daniel , is n't that what you use on your dishes ? " Your dishes , they are . Louise , sensitive to the evasions and direct hits of mothers-in-law , takes notice . Not Laura 's now but yours . She has never seen Dan looking helpless before , she values him for his unflappable assurance , which she trusts more than Billy 's unflappable incompetence . Dan is  --  was  --  chief of the village emergency rescue squad and she was always sure people slept sounder nights , knowing that ; at least she did . ( Though there were plenty of terrible jokes after the accident , and Billy kept talking about the fire chief , years back , who got caught setting his own fires because he liked to put them out . That kind of disloyalty made her heartsick . ) Dan is wringing the dishcloth into the sink as though he never wants to stop ; maybe he 's pretending it 's his mother-in-law 's stringy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a silver totem pole . Louise is a woman of few but passionate loyalties : she is ready to divide the world into villains and heroes if it will make her friend one bit more comfortable . What can she do for him now ? The situation is n't clear enough yet to know if she can , they can , step in and do what friends are for . She will be uncomfortable until she sees how they fit here now . " Danny , let me go see Laura , what do you think we came for ? We can see you any old time . " The brusqueness of this approach falls flat , it sounds absurdly tough . She is flushed with her defensiveness against these people who dislike Danny with severe bigshot bigcity meanness of spirit , and who are capable of sitting there this whole time without feeling the need to say a single word . They nod their heads when they 're introduced and then they make no effort at all to help out in  | a tough moment like this . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . ) She walks across the room feeling the way she did once in a high school fashion show  --  punished for the vanity that encouraged her to show herself in public when she 'd neglected , in private , to keep herself presentable . Her sandals flap . Mrs. Shurrock is watching her intently , puffing . Louise has never seen anyone hold a cigarette quite that way , her arm is inside out somehow , elbow forward , the butt hangs down as though it 's in a long black cigarette holder . The arm position alone is worth $50,000 a year . Billy stomps on through the kitchen behind her , head down as though there 's snow flying ; where she gets flustered , he gets angry . When they 're safely in the living room on the way to the sunporch , Louise snorts heavily and says , " Danny , how do you stand it ? They 're so nasty to you ? " She has her warm hand on Dan 's arm . But he looks at her , meeting her eyes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees such weariness and a kind of helpless wonder in them , that she knows she 's said the wrong thing . " Lou ? " He is shaking his vigorous head at her , at Billy , at himself and whatever ghosts haunt at large in his house . " Look , do n't forget , they 're her parents . Whatever I think about them . I do n't  --  what would you be like if somebody ? " and he gestures vaguely towards the sunporch . " I know but they never ? " " They never thought I should have got the time of day from her , right , but look what I got . And then look what I did with it . " b " Danny . " Louise is touched ; her blue eyes brim . She thinks how Dan always sees wider , farther than she or Billy , how his sympathy bobs to the surface and pulls him , like a child you 'd like to have  --  that is always her touchstone ,  | would I like to feel this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person who needs help most just then . She does n't know that , these days , there 's a ritual that Dan is faithful to , of announcing the most terrible possibilities concerning himself , before anyone else can . However effective it is , it happens that this is no ploy : he fears they are true , and he needs to keep hearing that . He has gotten to the point where repentance is the only position in which his mind , like a twisted limb , can rest . He holds Louise at arm 's length , far off in her own familiar world , and still shaking his head , he leads them in to see Laura . Louise sees Laura and falls on her knees . Needless to say she regrets this the instant it happens , she is mortified and frightened that she has offended everyone in sight , but she is a loving woman , not well defended , and she is helpless against this . Laura is her good friend . Was . They had shared a number of things  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laura 's oldest of two and Louise 's youngest of five ) , duties at the bimonthly blood drawing down at the church , hard-bottomed bleachers or side-by-side seats on the grass of the hillock at ball games , and not least in a place like Hyland , a strong antagonism to joiners ' groups like the Rebekahs and the Eastern Star . ( Louise comes fortified with reasons that camouflage her basic terror of being talked about  --  there is less possibility of being dissected if you rarely pass within their line of vision ; it is only reasonable . Her weight problem , as she earnestly calls it ? " her little pudge " to Billy , who does n't mind  --  has determined more in her life than Louise can say . Laura 's reasons had to do with being too smart and well educated to waste time sitting around exchanging recipes and gossip ; she ought to join the chapter of 15 1  | the university women that met to discuss books and the world 's affairs . But once Laura had said she did n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said that Dan probably would n't like it , though she had n't said why , and then tried to take it back with a shrug . ) But now Louise hangs on , desperate not to cry or cry out . She stands and smooths her blouse , the rolled hems of her shorts . Laura is lying on the couch the way one of those old stone queens would lie , arranged on top of her tomb ( she had seen one once in the Boston Museum on a high school field trip ; it was beautiful and awful at the same time ) . Her ankles , no , her feet , seem to be at an odd angle , disconnected , dangling . Her arms are at her sides ; they look relaxed . Her hair is short and ragged , has it been chewed out in her grief ? All that luscious heavy hair gone down the drain somewhere . She has always been jealous of that hair ; it 's never occurred to her that Laura might look different . " Lor , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen her friend just yesterday . " You cut your hair . " Laura answers by smiling . " Why , " Louise will ask Billy later , buckling her seat belt in the car , " why is it I saw so much  --  I do n't know , pity ? in her smiling . I mean , pity for me ? Did I seem so stupid or what standing up there on my two feet ? Should n't I have stood there like that ? Billy ? " Billy ? Louise ? There are days I dream in such gusts they would take me away except for the weight of the skin on my bones . I feel the flesh , it is smeared and heavy like a double coat of paint . A double coat of pain . I 'd like to be taken away . But we huddle under the locked dark , it and I , flattened as a can under such a weight of empty air . You  | want to know why they did n't cut the killed part off , I know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Works double time . I would like you to visit my head , I 'd keep the cancelled body out of sight . Next time you come I 'll have it closed in a box , all right ? With a padlock under my chin like a silver bow . I have no hands but the inward . They do not reach for you . Billy and Louise and the Shurrocks have left . At the door each became subdued , as if distant matters had suddenly flooded in to preoccupy them and keep them from saying some final dumb comforting word . Dan had never given much thought to it but he is beginning to see how much of what passes for conversation is the simplest filler ; like the down in a huge quilt , it shifts and settles and warms . But Laura 's accident has gripped it like a giant hand and squeezed ; there is no movement , no easing . He stands on one side of the obstruction and they on the other , fluttering absently , their words , their feathers confused , insubstantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cans for dinner . She can come to him if she wants to , she has attachments on the rims of her wheelchair like hard tumorous growths , like small fruits , that she can grasp , insofar as she can grasp anything . Her progress is slow . By a fortunate coincidence , because the whole room is an afterthought , a bastard sired on an elegant Colonial dam by an oblivious Victorian father , the door to the sunporch is unusually wide ; her chair can get through , although there is a nasty threshold that will take some seeing to . ( The other doorways in the house present problems . Whether they are insurmountable  | or not is far from clear . ) As to the front door : Dan carried Laura in from the car without her chair , carried her like a bride across the threshold of her first home ; Laura suppressed a bitter comment and gave her eyes that locked blind look that conveyed anger and the unwillingness to see more than she absolutely had to . Once inside , having thought this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he looked around wildly for a place to put her down . In all the months she 's spent at the Rehabilitation Institute he has never picked her up . She is heavy in a way he had n't anticipated  --  no arms around the neck , no upward thrust , only that cruel downward pull of dead weight , all of it falling in different directions . He stumbled to the couch and nearly dropped her , nearly fell on her , crushed her as the forward momentum of her inert body dragged him down . " Thanks , " Laura said . He removed his knees from her side : what gouges they must have made in her passive flesh . He muttered his apology , straightened her legs untenderly and went to get her chair . To do things ineptly , to stagger or falter , made him furious , his ears flushed red defensively , ears and neck and invisible chest ; he came apart . All the scoldings of his chaotic boyhood broke upon him and made him want to be childish again , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheelchair in one hand , as casual as he could be , trying to make it seem light although it was n't , she was flat on the floor . " Dan , " his wife said in a voice that worked approximately like her fingers when she deboned a fish , removed all together its delicate feathers of spine . " Will you please remember that I have no balance . No way to correct the position you choose to put me in . " " I did n't choose ! " he flared , as if in self-defense . " Then you 'd better learn to choose . If I break a bone  | you do n't know what it would mean to break a bone . " She could shake her head ; she did it now , hopelessly , long , even swings like those of a steeple bell heavy on its rope . " What do I have to do ? Tell me . " He was humbled . His heart pounded as if he 'd been chased , at the sight of her in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What do you have to do ? What do you have to do ? " She only shook her head ; she looked as if she could let it swivel there forever , without will . " How can I say this , it sounds so stupid . You have to be my body . All right ? You have to guess for me , feel where I am for me . Why did n't they tell you these things ? Why did you steal me away from there before they could teach you how to handle me ? This is no joke ! " At least this was her own voice , only more desperate , close to cracking . He felt reprieved and rebuked in the same moment . Did she really believe he thought this was a joke ? " I 'm a baby , Danny , you did n't want any more babies but here I am , only I 'm worse than any little squirming infant , do n't you know that ? Babies learn things , they get to be able to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not real , that 's what I am . I 'm your unreal wife who sleeps in a crib and has to be turned over and needs her diapers changed . " Dan said nothing . He shoved the cobbler 's bench coffee table aside and went to his knees and lifted her carefully , digging his fingers into her sides because she was not unreal , she had give and depth and vitality , and he had been kept from her for so long . When he laid her down it was carefully , leg against leg like a corpse arranged once and only once for burial . He chose from her speech the only part he dared acknowledge . ( Was he about to enter upon a life of cringing , skulking around corners hoping not to be seen ? ) " They were never going to teach me a single goddamn thing they did n't have time for all those months , babe . Could n't they have  | shown me something about what kind of balance you do and do n't have ? " " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she spoke to the ceiling . " Well , what does it feel like ? How the hell can you blame me for not knowing ? All they ever did was talk a lot . " She snorted at his injured innocence . " Well , sit there , then . Get in that chair and just flop forward  --  let go , just ? limp as you can get , like a Raggedy Ann or something . " He tried to , sitting forward on the footrest of the big blue chair . He poised like a diver on the board thinking whatever it is divers think , he wriggled his neck and let go . The floor came up at him , he looked into the dust between the widespaced old boards . There was a hairpin down there . The quick dive made him dizzy . " That does n't feel too good . " He forced a smile though only a frog could have seen him from where she lay . " You still have about ten times more control than I have . All those trunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if she had won a point , forced a wedge , and it made her forgiving . " Honey ? " " I guess it 's like a gym exercise , though . You stand up when you 're done . " " Honey . " She did n't ask him what he wanted , she would not hear it but turned her head away at the end of a wide swing and left it there facing the wall . What he thought he wanted to say , a broad gesture to sweep all the irrelevant details away , was " Honey , I love you . " He looked at the back of her head , where the tough little points of reddish hair lay their serrated edge against her collar . What would she do with his love , his greeting card , where she lay without balance ? It was like  | talking into a heavy wind , all his words blew back at him , broke up emptied , milkweed pods split and shaken out . " I need my leg bag drained . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grit your teeth . " " Stop . " He had learned this , it was lesson #1 , only he was n't sure he was going to be able to bear it . People do this , was all he could tell himself , and continued to sit still . People all over have to do this , there are so many messed-up people , and they all do . But he felt unreal . The two people this was happening to right now he did n't know ; he did n't even want to know them . At the Institute , in bright impersonal light , the nurse , Mrs. Toko , had shown him how ; called it her Procedure , stressed words like regularity , sterility , turgidity , flexibility ? it was easy , it all reminded him of high school chemistry ( though he concentrated harder this time ) , the endless opening of clamps and flanges , and twice a day the sterile solution in and out , the syringe like a turkey baster . She tried to frighten him into not forgetting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might be , how damn near impossible . " It 's all mechanical . Do n't expect her to feel it . She drinks eight times a day , you do this eight times . She cuts down , you cut down . Do n't expect her to feel it , just keep your eye on the clock now , " she had told him as if he were a child who tended to forget to stop playing and come home on time for dinner . " Remember the body goes into severe shock when there 's any blockage and the bladder is overloaded . You think it 's only the bladder but if you forget she 'll feel like she 's got a bomb in her head , her eyes will pop , you 'll see . The sweats , the shrieks . Some of them " ? and she 'd lowered her voice at the word " them " ? " some have told me they 'd rather die , after all they 've been through , than have  | another bladder crisis . You never want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling about a catastrophe she 's seen on her corner . " You 're exaggerating , " he 'd said , hoping . Eyes wide , shaking her head mournfully , she denied it . " Dear , you never want to see it . " He decided you 'd have to be crazy to doubt her . " Shall we do it here ? " he asked Laura . Laura laughed . " You sound like you 've got something really terrific in mind . " ( The hearthstone , that unyielding winter bed ; under the half-dead tree in the upper meadow , far from the house , both of them so white in the sight of the sun , with their clothes dropped all around like deciduous leaves ? " Here ? " she would always ask , skeptical . " You want to do it here ? " ) " You might as well stop thinking of this as private , pal .

They 'll love it anyway , the smell , the wonderful squoosh under your fingers , right , all that yummy plastic to keep the waterworks going . " " Stop . I asked you . " He was about to lecture her on taste , on decency ; instead he ran out and brought back a pot from the kitchen , and fast , as though the ceiling were leaking . " My good soup pot ? " " Look , it 's all in the family , is n't it ? I 'll get all the equipment together , do n't worry . " He smiled ; it was a funny line , was n't it ? " Your good soup pot . " He fussed with the clasp ; the more agitated he became , the more inefficient . It was worse than undoing a bra . " Frostbite , " he mumbled but she said nothing to encourage him . He felt punished . This was all to rebuke him . The warm bag that lay against her leg strained , softened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , warmed him . " Does that feel better ? "  | She did that shrug that seemed so normal . ( Remember the kids when they were brand-new babies , he thought . How remarkable that they could sneeze and yawn and hiccup . ) " It did n't feel bad . It did n't feel . " She shrugged a few more times , eager , maybe , to use her one natural movement . He tugged and straightened the bag , the tubing , and then paused , caught in a flash of perspective . His concentration had blacked out everything but the two of them sparring nastily as though on an ordinary day . There were no more ordinary days , though ; the weight of unsaid words , the old ones , the casual ones , lay on his body like the lap blanket across Laura 's legs when she sat up in her wheelchair . They would never be said , the ordinary fights would never be fought : why has n't the garbage gone to the dump yet , how can it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your kids ... . There was only this hideous ganging up , a bully against an unarmed girl . Unarmed , oh yes . . . . Her thigh , nearly bare to his sight now , was thin but he would recognize it if it 'd turned transparent . He ran his hand along the outside of her leg up and back , gently . The skin was warm , still pliant , the bones so long and familiar . As he moved his fingers , pressing down towards shadow , he imagined the tube that lay flaccid across her knee stiffening , behind its opaque smoothness turning golden with urine the color of cheap sauterne ; as soon as the bag was empty it would tense and flutter and begin , slowly , endlessly , to refill . Dan 's eyes opened wide and his lips flattened in an agony of effort . He was going to vomit , and if he vomited now , like this , at the sight of Laura 's body , the robbed husk of her body , he was going to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an axe ; there were rafters and good solid rope . He has thought of this before , of course , he has almost domesticated the idea , the ultimate painkiller and no exaggeration : a violent bloody grateful nearly companionable  | death : to ease his pain and to show her , show himself , he has wanted to feel her pain and then double it , triple it , till he has paid in full . What he made himself swallow back was sharper than a stone ; it hurt his chest . There will be a scar inside . She can wheel herself in to him if she wants to . It may take an hour . He turns on the radio for company . Hallie and Jon burst into the kitchen the way they always do ; the loose pane in the storm door rattles dangerously when they let it slam . Dan 's usual irritation rises in him , he opens his mouth to tell them to slow down , cool it . He stops , the paring knife clenched in his hand just as everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands are bizarrely tangled , it 's 6:29 , one of them is about to disappear . ) He realizes that the children are themselves again . The spell is broken , they have emerged from the bewitching terror of New York , where they were struck still and dumb as trees , stones ; they are fluid again . He has a distinct feeling , all through his hands , his arms , of ice thawing : how , in the lock of hard winter , the faucets finally trickle open , or the pump kicks on , warmed , like a mechanical horse , by a heating blanket . This instant , his children flowing past him in their natural rhythm , shouting , he holds in his body , the first relief he 's felt in days . Then it seeps back on him , the endless sadness and the shame , which is like a color , a smell , an exhaustion of his muscles , the one ice-lock that will not thaw . This time he feels his children allied with him in their conspiracy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turns away from : Thank God it was Laura because she can live in her head and I ca n't . He would take speechlessness , take stone silence , maybe even  | blindness , but not to feel : he knows his life only by the taste of it , the way he turns it under his hands , feels the drill bit bite , the pieces mesh , runs his finger over an edge to see if it wants sanding . His wife he knows by smell and touch , not by anything she thinks or says ; his children by the tension of their arms and legs bending , opposing , relaxing , in his grasp . He touches them greedily , endlessly , with something that is not sentiment but need . From the neck up , he thinks , has always thought , he 's a goner . Dan looks straight at the thought , which appears to loom and hover somewhere on the wall above the sink , where the tea strainer hangs on pegboard : Better that it was Laura . He ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or is simply , not dishonorably , true . Hallie and Jon have run in to Laura and are back in half a minute . They stand before him out of breath , arms dangling . " What is your mother doing ? " Hallie giggles . She has recently turned eight ; relaxed or nervous she giggles a large percentage of her waking hours and even , occasionally , in her sleep ( and they stand transfixed , wherever they are , straining to hear that unlikely nicker ) . When she is laughing she does n't need to talk , commit herself , make demands , be anybody in particular . She succeeds , too , in hiding a nearly adult seriousness from everybody except Laura and Dan . Her brother , for example , is endlessly irritated with her . This time when she gives her characteristic irresponsible hiccup of laughter , Jon gives her a shove he does n't try to hide . " Hey !  | " Hey yourself . Do n't laugh . " " I 'm not laughing . " She nurses the arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggrieved eyes on her father . " You do n't even know what you 're doing then . " Jon looks disgusted . From the first silent reunion with her at the Institute , Jon has been desperately trying not to be embarrassed by his mother , and the more he fears he 's failing , the more his embarrassment shows . " What do you mean , what 's she doing ? " he asks Dan . " She is n't exactly dancing . " " Do n't be fresh , " his father warns . ( That was his mother 's continuous warning , appropriate or not . Half the time it meant , I ca n't cope with you this minute . Do me a favor and cooperate . ) He is lining up carrots side by side , jabbing at them with his knife , to see how many slices he can cut at a blow ; the sort of playing at work that infuriates Laura , who can be grim before dinner . " She 's not helpless , she can move her chair , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in here ? " " I did n't think of it , " Jon says dismally , looking at the linoleum . " Should I go back and ask her ? " Dan brings the knife down on the carrots : seven at a blow ! " Just get me a saucepan , please . Hallie , set the table . " Dinnertime . The liberated woman considers her freedom . She does not want to be here , or anywhere she can imagine . She tries to see horses with their necks bent , how they are growing out of the grass , their ankles narrow as stalks . Searches out , in her memory , Danielli 's greenhouse : row on row of the same flower forced for Easter , something lush and lurid , purple on pink , sharp little varicose veins . She tries to smell the flowers although they are not there .  | What she smells is dinner . I am trying to be somewhere else and failing . Laura 's chair does not fit under the kitchen table . " It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerily , in the gruff wavering voice of a little girl about to cry , " but I think I 'm going to lounge around here a few feet back . " Laboriously she wheels herself into the corner . They stand and watch . " I 'll need my tray , Dan . " " We could eat in the dining room , it would be like a welcome home celebration ! " Hallie suggests , making her eyes go bright . Laura 's face softens with gratitude ; that smile , at least , is still available for the children . Dan knows , though , that all the tables are standard height , and the standard is off a mean fraction by Laura 's standards . The machine she sits in is hulking ; it gleams , in fact , like the motorcycle of his dreams . The ironies are merciless , he never knew there could be so many practical jokes set out like snares to catch the innocent : all that Harley-Davidson dreaming gone soft in the cheek , the ass , turned into a Moto-Skil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She ca n't even get through the dining room door on that goddamn throne . He wonders if she knows that . He will dream tonight of taking a nail file to the doorway , and when that fails , using his nose which resembles a vole 's , sharper and sharper , and making a neat pile of sawdust , like ashes . The life 's work of a carpenter ant . Winking to sleep in my chair here , my head bucking , a subway sleep , sometimes I think of my sister 's friend Theodore 's children . I am no longer to think of Theodore : forbid as best I can . ( My sister told me never to remember ,  | she spends her time forgetting . ) . . .

Poor Theodore is all my body All in the under dark . Ah do n't She had been wheeled up to him the first time too , in a manner of speaking : her parents were responsible for deliver-  | ing her . She made the long walk from their side to his through a glade of pines , scuffing through needles the color of her own hair as if she had been constructed purely out of the forest . It was the summer his Uncle John had rented out the little lucky Courser space they 'd always owned ( when they owned nothing else ) on Pottery Lake , for campers and tourists and other no-goods . ( John never took a vacation because he never worked ; he held it against those who did as a sign of the weakness engendered by ambition . ) Together they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ docks , that took too much wood  --  and scuffed out some unevenly cleared lots between the pines and scraggly bushes . " They 'll come and take ' em , " John promised , " do n't forget where they 'll be coming up from  --  Boston , Hartford , New York , all they got to do is see some green stuff you ca n't put in the bank or flatten down with a mower and they 'll buy , you mark me well . " That strange courtly language of John 's that got mixed in with the pig farmer 's . He painted a little sign , so unevenly lettered it seemed quaint and fake , that said " Pottery Lake Camp Sites . Private , by WEEK or MONTH , Get away from IT ALL ! " and hung it on the main highway that went through Hyland , right above a sign pointing towards a motel with TV in every room , as though to make a comment on civilization . John 's arrow pointed east and led to another sign and still another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The more remote the destination , John said , the better they 'd like it . A cheap week 's vacation in a leaky tent , for supper charred hot dogs and beans in a black pot , a long drive down for a movie on Saturday night : he had a poor man 's contempt for self-imposed poverty . But the lake ! The half mile of pebbles and soft dirt John owned , the only thing he 'd ever gotten from his family that was worth a damn , fronted on such cool  | transparent water that entering it was like holding a magnifying glass , for no reason but pure pleasure 's , to your feet . The white feet buckled and swam , seemed to move when they stood still , held fast in the pebbles . Dan could stare for half an hour trying to recognize his own white-green ankles . It was a pity these people had to pay $30 a week for the chance to lose apparent possession of their feet and see them crisscrossed with minnows quick as the sperm that made them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shoulder on haunch on calf , it would be a good deal . He helped John clear trees that spring , rode around on a borrowed bush hog devouring the underbrush like William Holden in a tank , and they built a couple of long tall outhouses side by side the size of telephone booths . Inside their doors John tacked up maps with giant stars on all the restaurants and antique shops in Hampshire County , or very nearly . " When I think of some of them so-called antiques , seems the proper place to advertise , " he told him , screwing in the hook and eye lock tight for the ladies . " Least we can hope the men'lI learn to use the trees like nature intended . " People came . There were dozens of Massachusetts license plates , the same people who drove up to drink beer in hunting season and shoot their toes off , or their best friend 's toes . Uncle John hunkered down his shoulders and set his lean face slightly crooked ; his wrinkles deepened . He came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his version of what he thought they expected a backwoods New Hampshire man to be . ( He might have been wrong . ) If he could have swung a maple syrup can in one hand and a bottle of dandelion wine in the other he 'd have done it ; he seemed to alternate cursing and silence ; tried to glower from under his bushy unkempt eyebrows ; Dan even caught him ruffling them one time , running his finger through them the wrong way .  | John Courser was a man who liked a laugh ; sometimes he laughed so hard , beginning with a high trickling giggle , he had to lean against a building or he 'd stagger down . But he seemed to think these campers wanted a New Englander to be a cigar store Indian . If they came to ask him for something ? a can to pick blueberries in , advice about where to go in Hyland to buy a tarpaulin  --  he studied the situation for a few interminable minutes , pulling on an old pipe he 'd resuscitated from somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . Inside his shed he 'd slap his knee and bellow with pleasure . In real life John could talk you into a stupor . Dan guessed that given half a chance  --  he 'd been given none at all  --  his uncle might have liked to have been an actor . The Shurrocks pulled up one morning very early . It was n't a time for campers to be doing anything but starting their fires : soft curses rose as the sun warmed the tops of the trees , fathers lit and lost fourteen matches for each damp pile of sticks , they wished they were home in their wallpapered breakfast nooks with their electric stoves glowing pink . The Shurrocks came to a grinding halt as though pursued . Dan opened an eye to the sight and sound of a car door slamming . He 'd been asleep in a pile of pine needles , all beer and sweat and a complicated misery . His mother was dead that spring , he was a month out of vocational college and eager for nothing , he could hardly remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck it through ; there were no jobs and he was stupefied by idleness except when he was working for his uncle , who let him wrestle with tree stumps and spread sand with a roller . There was a girl in Denham , the next town over , who claimed she was having his baby ; maybe his was the only name she could remember . The town 's youngest  | lawyer , who lost everything he touched  --  surprised he still has his collar buttons , John said  --  was trying to get his suspended license back ( " DWI : dimwitted imbecile , " said the lawyer , who knew at least a little bit ) . He picked his head up to see who had driven through the half-lit forest at eight in the morning sounding like ambush and saw an older woman and a young one stepping legs first out of a sharp and shiny dark brown car ; it was surely the kind that had no dealership in the state of New Hampshire . Laura Shurrock , in a short rumpled blue workday skirt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her dimples , stood and stretched , sticking her chest way out like a little girl about to do a backbend , collapse at the knees and touch ground with the part in her hair . Dan sat up in his pine needle bed . She was n't beautiful ; he could n't have named her specialness then , nor could he ever . But he had very little in his life that summer and , worse , wanted even less than he had . A single blurry look at Laura Shurrock restored his hunger and his thirst , pained him for his lost time , and made him greedy . Mrs. Shurrock had come towards him with the stride of a fourth-grade teacher whose students were overturning their chairs . DeWitt Shurrock sat , sane enough to be embarrassed for his wife , trying to look like a fine presence , an eminence beyond speech . He was at the steering wheel , though : he was the one who drove like a maniac . The good car subsided in the pale morning sun , settling the color of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get involved with : the kind of situation Dan liked and appeared , recently , to have run out of . There had never been much space in him , much he would tolerate , between wanting and having . His will had been a miraculous instrument , like a lamp he kept in his pocket and rubbed , when he needed it , with  | fierce concentration : it gave forth wonders . He would be cut to ribbons , Dan thought , sooner than he 'd learn these people 's names . The girl stood still for a long minute with her thin arms raised , tight fists at the ends , listening to the starlings squabble as though they were the well-advertised beautiful birds of the wild north wood . Dan rolled some warm beer around in his mouth and spat it into the rust-red pine needles , fouling his nest . He stood up , brushed himself clean , straightened his dungaree legs , raked his dusty hair with his fingers , and went out to claim Laura . He 'd prided himself that no girl was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too good ? He rarely got close enough to see but his philosophy ( to honor it with a name ) was that all girls wanted the one thing he wanted , only some priced themselves out of the market . Their loss . He made his girls say " please " and " thank you , " he gave them orders and would not negotiate ; he had the reputation of a hawk among mice ; a jailor who did favors for those who did n't plead . But there was no place to go with that authority : he never even got to see a girl with all her clothes off . The back seat of his car was like a gym : the place where you went for exercise , or to win the game . But half the time he could n't remember the difference between winning and losing . He never expected beauty ; he never got it . It did n't take long to move in on Laura . ( The phrase had begun to repulse him . Later , when she was pregnant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was  | growing inside and it changed one 's tolerance for harsh stimulants . ) But Dan moved fast , he circled and teased and got himself chased all over the court like a limber basketball player . In fact it was his hands that were limber : Laura said gravely that they were magician 's hands , not because they performed miracles but because of the way they sliced and folded and arranged things with such clean practiced movements ; they went right to the spot , they rarely had to look for it . It was the first of the things that impressed her , his plain and fancy professional hands . She watched him build a rain shelter . " No big thing , " he said ; he felt bare in the rawness of his words . " Nobody 's ever very impressed with his own best points , " she told him . ( As soon as a girl was eager to be impressed , it was all over ; she could put up with anything . ) " That 's good , too . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making fun of . He thought he 'd have to hide her from his friends . " All the people I grew up with live in their heads . My father does n't know what a ? " ( she flung her hands around helplessly ; he wanted to take them ) " ? a tongue in groove ? tongue and groove ? ? are ? is ? Which is it ? " " Tongue in , " he told her ; then , his mouth already open on the words , suppressed the obvious next line which would have been sufficiently clever for the kind of girl he knew , like the pregnant cow in Denham : something about his tongue , her groove . He was appalled ; he smiled at Laura and gratefully made himself quiet . He began , in fact , to discover the virtues of quietness , the bottomless depths you could suggest for yourself without quite lying . He surprised himself : what was lying and what was n't ? The question opened wide for him , like arms he did n't exactly deserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | signs of her uniqueness : less rather than more , gentleness rather than power ; keeping quiet , just reaching out for her , but not demanding . Her hand , barely touching . The long crevice where her bathing suit tucked between her legs when she bent over . The distance between their bare arms so infinitesimal it drew the small hairs up like electricity . Admiring without touching  --  it was an exquisite challenge . He was sharpening his appetite , he told his uncle ; getting the juices flowing . Any other girl did that to you , John said , you 'd call it starving . He had not come , after all , from a family of gentle men and it took a painful chastening of his impulses to learn subtlety where braggadocio came naturally . ( Braggadocio was his high school English teacher 's favorite word ; she had beat him over the head with it . He loved it , that anything so flamboyant and mysterious and foreign-sounding could be called his natural style ; it sounded like a compliment . ) It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on twelve mattresses and a pea . But her father did n't , summer or winter , piss against a maple in the yard , swat his children from one wall to the other , and die of drink or malnutrition or fury or one snow too many ; whichever it was . She had n't such a father but she was touched and not repulsed that Dan did . Thank God Kenton Courser did n't have to be coped with in the flesh anymore , she did n't have to be insulted by him : lacy drawers , narrow nookie , flat titty schoolmarm , he could imagine his father 's booze-heavy Saturday night voice , call it up as a gutcrunching echo every day of his life if he let himself . Telling Laura about his father a little at a time , letting the old terrors leak out , the facts or the fear that lay just beyond the facts , straining to see him as a boy who must have planned , like he did , to have sons and must never have thought to abuse them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | brought him to such emotion ? He 'd never dared show a girl anything besides bare skin , hipbone , anklebone  --  was it his father who made him want to cry , or Laura who sat gravely listening , with her legs slightly parted ? r She was wearing blue jean shorts ; the half-invisible hairs on her thighs , like lights on the water , were silver . That was n't the way the girls he knew allowed themselves to sit , they were preoccupied , all the time , with the arrangement of their bodies . Even when they were n't " sitting decent " ( his mother to his sister Fran : " Never with your legs open , unless you 're asking for id " ) they were always aware , then , of their indecency : it was one or the other . They chose . With this quiet girl from Boston it seemed to be neither , her mind was on something else : ( Her mind ; he tried to imagine it and could n't . What did it do out here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on gears and rocker panels and wood sealer ? ) She had a slightly flushed , substantial look , he thought ; not heavy at all but something weighted nearer the bone ; maybe she was one of those people who could n't float . Her thick reddish hair rode all around her neck like a mane , unruly . She kept it in a rubber band but it fanned out anyway . He guessed she 'd never been to a beauty shop and what she had for it was lush and inviting , not like his old girls with those thinned-out greased-up goldstreaked piled-on wedding cakes they wore for special occasions and then , when you wanted to most , would n't let you mess . There was delicacy and force in her , and that serious listening quality , so that she was very quiet while he talked , she asked him questions and answered his meticulously , just as she sat in her own straightforward way , without coyness . She did n't seem to know or care how the Hyland girls pumped to keep a conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their desperate background music endlessly like human jukeboxes . Those were the girls his friends had begun to  | marry and to run from ; after a few months they came and stood around with him and the other survivors and holdouts , staring at the floor , trying to be alone in their old familiar company . By her listening Laura taught him to talk with the expectation that he would be heard . The first time he kissed her ( terrified that she 'd be terrified , or feel herself used or ordinary ) he felt how tightly she held herself : stiff , without breathing , she clenched her eyes shut and seemed to work at the kiss . But it was concentration ; it was trying to do it perfectly and feel it perfectly ; she was only as serious about kissing as she was about listening . He tried to step backwards to see himself whole , but that was n't a direction he was used to ; there was nothing to do but bungle straight ahead and hope . He did n't ask himself what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a college called Wellesley that sounded like a country club with a library instead of a bar : it was hard to imagine the campus she walked on , deep ridges overwhelmed with lush trees in purple flower ; the galleries of paintings , the linen-covered tables with gold samovars , behind them , bowing , silent servants in tuxedos . She had fallen in love with her philosophy instructor , she told him in that same measured voice in which nothing sounded as stupid as she said it did , certainly not that . This little deepwoods vacation with her parents seemed like a wise cooling-off from what she called , chillingly , " an unwise relationship . " " Who called it that ? " he asked her . " Well . I 'm nineteen . " She smiled wanly at him . " So ? Up here nineteen 's getting to be an old lady . " " Really ? " " Really . " Up here , though , were a lot of things she would n't necessarily approve of : there was Lake Regions State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gym instead of a library . He never could believe it was a real college ; that was the only way he could get himself to go . His teachers were frauds , coaches with fancy letters after their names , and as for the flowers she thought a college needed , the only kind anybody managed to plant were stunted little marigolds and the kind of petunias you see in front of Hyland Exxon . He saw Laura walking with her philosophy professor under the purple trees ; he saw them pass out of his sight into shadow . He was , in fact , a young man of ordinary tastes and it seemed hopeless to try to dissimulate with her ; she would have found him out . Her philosophy man liked Heidegger , she told him , and he nodded bleakly , wondering if that was a place or a beer or a sport . What did he like ? Tearing up trees on the bush hog . Swimming in heartstopping water . Bobsledding . He liked dogs , all his life he 'd put a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him away . He liked wellshined shoes ; football that 's more brains than shoulders ; hot pepper sauce ; cheeses that do n't smell like someone 's been sick in the room ; all four-wheel-drive vehicles . He had never eaten an artichoke , nor heard a dulcimer . He fell asleep on uplifting music , though he liked to sing , and thought cars should be fast , not solid . The flag of the state of New Hampshire made his stomach sink with a churning excitement , almost a kind of pain , which must have to do with something he 'd done as a child : carried the flag ? damaged it accidentally and been punished for it ? seen it in the V.A . Hospital where his father was dying ? He was n't patriotic , the word would never have occurred to him ; why did he feel so unsettled when he saw the high-masted sailing ship against the sun ? Once he blew his nose into a silk handkerchief and then and there decided that he would become rich , or wished he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , of a  | private sweetness , meant more than the drape of any suit or even the chrome on a car . He hid this petty preference from his friends who would have thought him a pansy for it . And getting rich was never the point ; getting halfway decent might be , if he ever got good and ready for it . He had always thought of himself as someone who got what he wanted : he thought Laura needed to know this , his honor demanded that he warn her so that she might defend herself if she wanted to . As a young boy , the youngest , he could charm his mother , whose experience of grown men had been nothing but mutilating . She would have given him permission to take the world but all she had of it was what he could find in her worn brown change purse , which reminded him of a tongue , of all her hidden places , limp and cracked . She worked nights at the paper mill all his life , all hers ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a balance of terror , benign but effective : the annual lecture to the Society of Future Felons of N.H. was directed at his truculent head by Mrs. Hurley , principal . One day , to prove he deserved it , he had stood behind her while she reviled him , making motions first of picking her up off the ground , easy , and when that failed to get a sufficient laugh , of buggering her , with his eyes cast to heaven . He was smarter than his friends , played the odds , used his smooth face and eager goodboy looks , the persistent near-smile , the reassuring firm jaw , something clean about him that had to do with a soul that was subsisting on hope faintly warmed by his mother 's love , and not with fastidiousness  --  something of this combination got him behind closed doors , dispersed his enemies , helped him to escape continuous punishment . There had been plenty of need for absolution and escape : he was n't mean but he 'd always been sloppy , had had a childhood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bicycles , and  | once the top drawer of the only decent piece of furniture they owned ; finally , of breaking girls , snapping their flesh like some cellophane wrapper to get at the sweets inside ; and breaking hearts , that too . But there was some glamor in him , some obscure enviable energy that made his arrogance only appropriate ; did n't he deserve , by taking them , the things he got ? At the worst his friends and he were vandals , irritating as the black flies that came in their season . What trouble and confusion they made was never intolerable . Hyland bored them ; they had known each other , known the two main streets that met at a T and the leafy roads and old wooden stores forever : in another life . To keep their hands busy , their adrenalin in working order , they broke into summer homes and hunting camps . Once inside , the conversation was always the same : " Hey look at this ! " to signify the discovery of anything worth ten dollars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got another whole set of this stuff back home , right ? " Dan 's resentment was real ; he never stopped being angry at the summer people and their endless duplications : his mother had patched together a set of china with one representative of every species of flower around the border . Even if the chipped plates in these strangers ' kitchens came from the Ladies Auxiliary Thrift Shop he was angry ; it was excessive . He and his friends would leave by the windows , would take the highways at unconscionable speed , occasionally in someone else 's car . ( " Danny 's gon na jump-start his hearse , " somebody once said . ) They were all known to the cops , as the cops , and the cops ' imperfect pasts , were known to them . But they were amateurs , every one of them ; in spite of their noise and their showy toughness , small-town punks who did n't need were n't desperate . This was all braggadocio , that ticklish word : blood made the difference . But they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet .  | Laura took him to Cambridge . One day near the end of her three-week vacation , his license still impounded , he borrowed John 's abominable car and drove it well below the speed limit ; his hands clenched and unclenched on the steering wheel . Within ten minutes of their arrival in a dark and noisy restaurant in Harvard Square that smelled of deep fat fried again and again , Dan felt himself growing critical , growing complicated . A darkness stole across his vision the way a fever dimly announces itself behind the eyes . He sat discovering that disappointment and relief could live side by side , could tease and be painful , and that he could watch them from some small remove . He moved a step back into himself , brooding . Finally he brought out his disappointment to look at it . " Half the girls in Cambridge look like you , Laura . " But that made her laugh . " Is that an accusation ? " She was astonished : he was serious . " I never said I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you look so hurt ? " He could n't say why . It was taxing to wonder . For one thing he found himself at a disadvantage : a question of turf . He was as territorial as a cat , but he had never known it . Across the room sat another girl , darker , but with Laura 's approximate profile : same bright scarf knotted under her hair that added color to her face while it took away softness . The gold hoops wobbled in her ears as she spoke , and spoke with an identical earnestness  --  that well-fed , wellread upperclass peasant look . She probably sat with lips and thighs parted boyishly , like Laura . " Is it what that makes you think about me and how boring I am , or , somehow that I do n't understand , what you think about you ? " When she leaned across the table the edge bit into her breasts and left an indented line when she sat back  | again . That must have hurt ; he felt protective of her body . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wished he had some beer . Probably these people did n't think it was proper to drink beer . He took a bite of a very bad muffin that disintegrated when he touched it . " Home cooking . " He wet his index finger and picked the crumbs up with it ; disgusted , he poked a clean circle all around his plate . " Like sometimes when I 'm shopping I think I 've found a sweater or something that 's really unique , you know ? " She was eager to help . They all said " you know " the same way , he could even hear it as he sat here , the deep pleased voices of these Harvard people assuring each other that they knew , they knew , of course they understood , on all sides . " And then I find a whole tableful of the same sweater and ? " " Shut up , " he told her with a new and desperate confidence , surprised at how trivial she sounded . " You 're making it worse . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee stains . " Well , tell me what you 're thinking then , will you , if you do n't like my analogies . " " Your analogies . " " My analogies . Stop that , that 's a word I use . Do n't be lazy . " That was her force , to counter his : she could command him , and sternly . She was soft and hard , like those breasts she had leaned across the table , and not particularly conscious of being either . Probably the rest of these girls were too : it came with the green bookbag , the good teeth , large and white and stony . They all played instruments , these hard soft girls , and sports he barely knew the names of  --  were n't these the kinds of people who fenced and played lacrosse ? " Shit , " he said to himself . The word was comforting . " I 'm thinking I do n't know a single goddamn thing , that 's all , and I do n't know why you 're sitting here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own kind . But I 'm not sure I even knew I had a kind . " She drank some cold coffee . " Oh yes you did , that 's silly . You do n't have to leave Hyland to know there are all kinds of people up there . You think you 've got to call it sociology to know who your friends are ? " " Maybe . " He put his head against his hand , meekly , and closed his eyes , a little sick . " I thought you were this miracle that walked out of the woods , I do n't know , Sleeping Beauty or somebody . Unbelievable . This mermaid that got washed up a hundred miles out of the sea . " She smiled sadly but said nothing . " But see , if you 're not ? " He shrugged , meaning the end of something she could n't see . " Well , " she asked when he did n't go on . " Then what am I ? I 'm sorry to disappoint you so . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what it , it 's what you can slip back into , this whole scene I did n't know existed . You just walk through the door ? " He could see the woods slamming shut behind her , like the huge freezer door at the meat market where he worked one summer a thousand years ago , all the warmth outside with her . " Danny . " She took his rough hand this time and spread the fingers very slowly , causing a terrible consternation in his body and his soul . She closed and opened them like a fan , she was playing with him . " I think I 've seen this in the movies . You think you 're some kind of summer thrill for a nice sweet little professor 's daughter . Do you ? A little bit soiled around the edges maybe , just a wee little bit nasty , you know , rank and dangerous ? Maybe to scare mama and papa into appreciating the philosophy professor ? " Jesus , he thought , and pulled his hand away . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never even  | occurred to him . He had never been hurt , he realized , plummeting backward , falling into a darkness in which there were no walls decorated with swords and lances , there were no dozens of people sitting all around him . He let his head fall into his open hand , trying to keep his cool by main force . " I 'm no stud , Laura . Jesus Christ . " " Dan , I do n't like to disappoint you but there must be , oh , maybe fifteen kinds of dangerous men in this city , I 'd say . It 's a small town too , even if it 's bigger than Hyland . I 'm not counting Boston . Dangerous boys , too . " Her voice was mellow with mock patience . " But I do n't know if you could even get into the heats . Is that the phrase ? In sports . The final competition ? So there 's got to be something else . " He wanted to go home to the girls he scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like so much good china and then walk around the table getting all the edges lined up . " Danny , do n't sulk , please ? Can I take you home and show you our house ? You 'll never get to see it if we do n't . " He looked at her , stricken blank with hope . This was unfair . " I like pine needles and nice warm Chevrolets but a room with a view of Brattle Street ? " " You wo n't need a view . " He clutched her hand with a ferocity he failed to notice and she did n't break from . He was dizzy with the alternations in his , in their , possibilities ; so that , leading him up Brattle , shouldering through the summer school crowds of women she nearly resembled , she felt as if she had a docile child by the hand . It took him an hour to get over her house . The glare of it blinded him . Most of it was glass and polished chrome , but then there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library , he guessed . " Inherited , " Laura told him . " My Victorian grandma . Mother has gone modern even though she ca n't stand the stuff , but she had to move out of her mother 's house , sort of . " The force of it rolled over him ; he stayed close to Laura 's side for fear the distance , the sheer empty space and all it represented , would come between them just when he could n't let it . It was not for nothing that his parents had protected him against the rich by teaching him to despise them . All she could find in the refrigerator was white wine , mayonnaise , a jar of wheat germ that looked like a pound of sawdust , and a can of guava shells . " Is n't guava bird crap ? " Dan asked . He was just getting the chill out of his voice . When she looked at him disapprovingly she was her mother 's daughter . " Guano , you mean . " There was no sense making conversation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight down . " That was no shot glass , showoff . " He held up the glass for more . " I 'm drinking to my mother 's ghost . Once when she got laid off at the paper mill she cleaned up a house like this but the old lady died and they auctioned everything off . She went and watched them knocking down the stuff she dusted for thousands of bucks . Every piece cost thousands . " " Are you rubbing my face in this , as if I can help it ? " He was startled . " I 'm not rubbing your face into anything . We keep getting confused about who I 'm talking about when I get depressed . " She poured him another glass . " My refrigerator always had a pitcher of dry milk in it . It used to separate into the water half and the milk half , you know ? And a pack of baloney getting dried up at the edges because I was always stealing a piece and forgetting to wrap it up again . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very subtle , " Laura said . He finished the wine and rang the rim of the glass with his fingernail . The sound was high and pure , the voice of a young girl . She took him to her room , which was pink because it had n't been painted since she was eleven , and busy with posters of the kind of paintings people said their cats could do by walking through wet paint . Once he had taken a girl to bed in her own bedroom , in her trailer ; another time he had snuck into a dormitory at college and hidden under the covers while his girl tried to get rid of her roommate . When the roommate would n't budge , she climbed back under the covers and kept her hand over his mouth . Girls ' bedrooms gave him the same fearful feeling as churches ; to desecrate them was a special thrill . ' ? Laura made getting undressed take twenty minutes because , she said , she had all that woods to get over , those animals cracking twigs behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd be more scared of your mother , " Dan said . " It 's all the same , they 'd mutter it all out and take me before the family tribunal . " " Are you serious ? " He was n't sure what a tribunal was but it sounded daunting . " Did they haul up your philosophy professor like that ? " " Ssh , " she whispered . " You do n't talk about other men at a time like this . " " But maybe you think about them . " If she did n't , he did . " At a time like this , " though : what a signal of arrival . She pulled off his last sock and dropped it precisely on its  | mate . When she bent there , in midafternoon light , her breast rippled like the whole summer 's lake water , shimmering . He wanted to walk away so he could just watch her move through the room , he needed an hour , a week of unabashed staring . He did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was such a good girl ; now she seemed to him endless , round and womanly , pleased with herself and a little bit frightened , nowhere knobby or sinewy like the half-glimpsed chickens he dragged across the upholstery of his Vega ; she was a new species , and she knew it . " You see the disadvantages of a sneaking-around life . " She did n't even have to whisper ; her parents were reading The New York Times , sitting in beach chairs with their feet in Pottery Lake , they always did that as though they 'd walked around the city all day and needed soothing . " Laura . " His voice was strangled with the effort at control . " I do n't think I ever stood still with a girl like this . " She volunteered no history of her own . " You 're growing up , child . " She was stronger and weaker than he in such perfect proportion he wanted to roar with frustration and pleasure . When he touched her left breast with the palm of his hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuddered . Would he learn gentleness from her as well as silence ? And the trust to hold on ? He was not going to fall upon her , this torture was his pact with her and sex did n't even seem to be what it was about . He would learn from her , God only knew what he could gladly humble himself to learn . To begin with , there was this most staggering opulent unstolen pleasure in a life of small change . In the bold light of her bedroom window that opened onto plush well-tended city trees , he looked at Laura Shurrock 's face , which was as new to him as the leisure to study her body ; looked at her green eyes compli-  | cated with islands of brown ; at the flush of her fair skin as she strained away from him , and she seemed to be telling him this was no ending . If he meant no danger to her , could he somehow mean safety ? He was awed at her and at himself with her . She was coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would put the seal of their bodies on this quilt-covered bed in her parents ' house . She seemed to be saying the stain , the seal , would not easily come out . " Laura ? " He calls her quietly because he thinks she may be asleep . The television set is droning just below the level of sense ; it was Jon 's gift , before his bedtime , to set her up in her chair in front of a show she had never in her real life dreamed of watching : con men chased cops chased women into all the dark corners of the picture . " Okay ? " Jon asked , delighted at his thoughtfulness . Laura looked at him as if he had already died , or gone away from her . Her long locked gaze , Dan is learning , they are all learning , is a form of hypnosis . The helpless are given a few nearly occult powers , as reparation . This penetrating glance is hers : she can get anything with it but what she wants . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands  --  an adult gesture , Dan thinks  --  a lover 's or a parent 's gesture ! ? and kneels down in front of her . He puts his head on her knees . Dan trembles on behalf of the indwelling catheter but Laura seems not to worry . He will try not to worry ; it is her body . ( Or is it , if she does n't feel it ? Is it anybody 's , then ? Is it no one 's ? ) " Mommy , " Jon says without looking up at her . " Mommy , I love you so much . " As if it were in dispute ; he does n't know what he gives away by his declaration . Jon has never said any such thing before , not since he was very little , though he 's a  | warm permeable boy who has n't ever cared for the tradition of hell-raising that made his father a determined bum his first twenty years . He is on the firm side of frailty , of studiousness , he introduces a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but safe and good . Still he would never tell his mother what he is telling her except for the grief in her eyes . " Are you trying to make me cry ? " Laura asks him , trying for jauntiness ; it is her most futile emotion . ( Perhaps one needs to be free to jump up and demonstrate jauntiness to be convincing about it . ) She manages to touch his head with the bent back of her hand . He nuzzles against that pressure , pushes back . They remind Dan of young animals butting for greeting . " No , I do n't want you to cry , " he tells her with great composure . " I 'm trying to make you happy . Mom ? " " Mmm . " " I never liked the way you made my bed , you know . " " What ? " She strains to hear him . " So please do n't do it anymore . I will . " He laughs out loud , nervously , glancing at his father quickly , checking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Is that a joke ? " his little sister asks in a sharp appalled voice , clapping her hand over her mouth . She too is guarding her mother . " Is that a joke ? ' " Jon echoes , his only nastiness saved , always , for Hallie . Laura begins to cry , suddenly , silent , not for show . Her emotions these days change at the touch of a hair . The tears must run down inside her when she cries like that ; they must puddle there and never dry . " Are we going to have to live like thieves ? "  | Her son hugs her knees desperately , needing comfort . " I was trying to be funny , Mommy , I did n't ? " " I know you were , " she says gently , sniffling . Who will wipe her nose ? It barely pays to cry . " Only you know I ca n't stand it when you children go at each other that way . You know ? " " Oh that . " Jon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up someday . " He shoots her a look that promises : Later . Later you 're getting it . " All right . To bed , " Dan says . " I 'll come up and kiss you . " Set free , relieved , they run off into their ancient routine : wash , bed , kiss , book , nightlight . ( He does n't know if they need the muffled light anymore ; but habits are needs , are n't they ? Are real . ) . Dan leans over Laura . " There 's a tear on the end of your nose , madam . Is there anything you 'd like me to do about it ? " She closes her eyes against him : Laura whose fine face is imprinted on the inside of his eyelids ; her wide-apart eyes under such precise arches of brow ; her firm , no-gosh no-golly nose ( that 's what he calls it ) . She does not have the face of a cheerleader . It can absorb a good deal of pain with dignity , or pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not petty . " We will not live like thieves , lady . Ever . " He sucks up the tear into a kiss . " What do we have here that does n't belong to us , please tell me that . " Silence from Laura , the set jaw , the locked teeth . It is already beginning to bore him , this listless abdicating silence . " Do you know how happy your children are ? " " At what ? " " At having you home . " " No I do n't know . I do n't intend to lie to myself any more than I need to . "  | Her feet are flat on their foot pedal ledge , her hands arranged on the cool arms of the chair . He thinks , how strange to stay in the same position for laughing and for crying . " Goddamn it , neither do I. " " Dan , do n't badger me . " " I 'll badger you if I want to . I do n't want to but I will . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little . " " Dan , " she says wearily . " Please . This is your firm , macho approach , I can see that , but it 's transparent . I have n't become an imbecile , you know . " " You know what we 're doing ? " " I 'm sleepy . I need a lot of sleep . " She turns her head vaguely towards the door , in the general direction of sleep . " Do you know ? " He is jubilant , he pulls her head back by her short hairs till she cries out . " We 're having our first good old fight , hey . That was fast . " " You sound like you 're on a situation comedy , do you know that ? You sound like Dick Van Dyke . " " Well , is n't that what this is ? I thought that 's what this was all about , is n't this ? " He looks all around him as though he 's just discovered he 's in the wrong room . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard or is she impatient with his usual volubility ? She has been known to love him for this , which is foreign to her and which she calls gaiety ; there is even a particular spot , the hollow in his neck above the collarbone , that she has made it her habit to kiss when he clowns for her . He heads for the door . " All right , toots , watch your cops and robbers . " He tells her this in someone else 's voice . " See you around . "  | Hallie is pretending to be asleep when he comes to tuck her in . No sense of how well grownups know the possibilities ; she thinks she 's convincing , an animal playing dead . Jon , though , knows very well what he can fake and what he ca n't . He is lying stiff in his bed . Dan wants to sit down and comfort him , wants to tell him he knows it 's hard , it 's going to be harder still . He puts his hands down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult , father , composed and thoughtful . Up close , he 's no better off than Jon but will not frighten him by saying so . And more : the first word he really learned from Laura , that summer in the woods , was platitude . She drew a little picture for him of a paunchy flat-footed bird she called the Duck-billed Platitude . To judge from the frilled candy papers all around , it had gorged on a hundred sweets ; it was an appealing bird from a distance but if you looked hard it had menacing teeth and wavy lines around it , to indicate , she said , the smell of rotten eggs . He sat for a minute or two looking hard into his son 's earnest face . Let him try to learn words-without-words , let him master them early : another gift from Laura . Jon gave him the upper edge of a buried smile . It was embedded in the boy 's face like a rock and Dan had to pull hard to get it out . There is a bag of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in his hands ; his anger nearly chokes him . He is sure he does n't know an uglier word in the English language than prosthesis . His first , inadvertent imagining when he heard it was of an artificial penis , something pink and rubbery , held on by straps attached by tubing to the hidden glands . He could n't imagine Laura and the word at the same time without gagging . The catalog of inventions ! What  | was worth it ? The Queen Mary Tub Seat , the Swedish Grip Tong , the Bac-a-rac Bedboard . Less than ten ounces , made of sections riveted together in the center with a washer applied for smooth operation . The cock-up splint and the rotary splint , the flexor hinge hand-splint that lifts your wrist with a whiff of CO2 , kids love it , they 'll come from miles around to see : if you ca n't order a normal parent , order one whose wrist lifts at the flick of a switch , like Howdy Doody . And oh , the toggle switch , piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flange with variable-width tubing , the duralumin reaching tongs .. . ( She said to Jon and Hallie in this very place at the counter , " Chocolate milk in your thermoses okay ? " her head cocked for an answer . Flat feet she had trained to high steely arches from running on sand , from dancing . Arches off the cool brick-red linoleum . " I do n't think there 's such a word , ' thermoses , ' " Hallie said , looking up from her embroidery hoop . " Is there , Daddy ? " Daddy did n't know or very much care ; he let it be . Laura shrugged and poured milk into the Quik , humming something with a thousand notes . The spoon hit the sides of the plastic glass , a dull click . She snapped the locks on their lunchboxes and moved her head in a satisfied nod , like a pat on the flank of some live thing . ) Prosthesis lived in a crack in the dictionary between prosthenic ( stronger in the foreparts ) and prostibulous ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she is n't in need of a prosthesis , " Mrs. Toko kept assuring him , irritated . " Why have you fixed on that ? Prostheses take the place of missing limbs . Your wife ? " Is only disconnected , he thought . The plugs pulled , the current shorted . " Your wife will have other systems of support . " " Like a man in space , " he said , imagining commands from Houston coming in to her , those crewcut  | midwest voices telling her when to move , to laugh , to pee . " Affirmative , " she 'd say and move not a single finger . He had practically stolen her from the Rehabilitation Institute where she was not being rehabilitated . For one thing she never cried there , he was n't sure she breathed or sweated . They pushed food into her and pulled it out . She sat like someone in a ward of what the children sweetly called " mentals " and studied the wall behind his head . He could n't blame her : this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take heart , to learn to crawl and walk and jump ( oh , to make leatherette purses and be proud of them , and birdhouses and pen wipers : she would love to make the least of them . And then there were the traitors who learned to drive ) . She was not going to learn . Not a single trick ; only the movement of the plastic and metal and awardwinning-design lightweight aluminum : her surrogate limbs were going to school here , in fact had graduated . There was nothing more . Some of the moving parts belonged to the house , like chained-down ashtrays he 'd met up with in New York , some of them he bought from the Institute PX when they left , they 'd been made expressly for her and they were not cheap , and they did not even necessarily work , and some he 'd have to find in Boston however he could . He thought , her own , her very own plastic prick to have and to hold , they 'd take it home in a doggy bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , an onflight underseat limb carrier , her very very own and his . See her learn to write her name in the air with the all-purpose patent-pending pseudo-dong : LAURA COURSER . GONE FISHIN . She was sitting in an electric wheelchair in the lounge watching him argue with her doctor . Her neck was stiff and her body in its tight steel-backed corset was pliable as an old churchgoing Hyland widow 's . She looked mildly curious as though she did n't know this man . Cowlick , clean collar , vitu-  | peration . Did he have a wife ? A job ? A subway token ? What did he want with her ? " Before you go , Mr. Courser , " said the very even-tempered doctor , as young as he and cool as a thug . His goldrimmed glasses flickered . They were opposed to his dragging Laura home , they referred to it as theft , they did not like impulsive or passionate outbursts , they were an Institution , had schedules and plans and he was not humble in the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being thanked . They saw nothing beyond their patients , who dropped out of nowhere , broken or bent . They pretended to have a deep concern for families but Dan felt untouched by it ; felt invisible ; did not , like so many others , " attend the patient , " nor even borrow her weekends because they lived a hundred flights of stairs uP and he 'd have a heart attack just getting her into the apartment . " I want to say  --  quietly , here please , let 's not involve Laura if that 's all right ? " and they moved aside . " That I would worry a little ? " pause because he was going to say something difficult and perhaps insulting ? " that you appear to be as angry at Laura as you are at anybody else right now . " " Who ? " He nearly stamped , knew he was being petulant , could n't control it better than this since what he really wanted to do was roll on the tile floor and beat his head , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who should I be angry at then ? Who ? " His voice like a thirteenyear-old 's , ripped down the middle , jagged on both sides . If he were n't such a child , Laura would say . ( " Whom ? " Hallie would say , her mother 's daughter , the village grammarian . ) " No one , " the doctor admitted , and smiled . " Well . Some people turn their attention to , unh , God at times like these , I suppose , but " ( he looked around like a conspirator to see if he was being overheard ) , " but if that were your preference I trust you could have thought that out for yourself . " His  | bought sigh . " No one then . But Mr. Courser , your wife has been here for months now , it 's safe to suggest that it 's time , you know , to start adjusting . She has her ups and downs , certainly , but she 's trying . She does n't say much , tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works out hard and makes a real effort , so I 'd take that as a sign . A vital sign , you might call it . And so  --  you see , this marching off with her like this  --  this unprecedented instant removal from a safe and supportive environment . We like to get our patients and their families ready , you know . We have an entire department that is devoted to nothing but discharge planning , with all its little ins and outs , a thousand little details to make home adjustment more comfortable . We have a whole trained staff . " He was being cheated , his forehead wrinkled like a small boy 's , aggrieved . " And now , your anger appears to be  --  if I may  --  irrelevant . Do you know what I 'm saying ? Counterproductive . " He looked down humbly . " Unkind , even . As if it were a punishment . " But she dreams about crowds , Dan wanted to say , when she closes her eyes ! They flow back and forth like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words exactly because they were so strange , this testimony she brought him from a foreign land . ) People come to see her and they stand in the doorway a hundred deep . Would that make sense to the doctor , did he have a trained staff to see such dreams ? All of them walking , moving , flexing muscles she remembered before the root rot got them . The cutworms . The slugs . Before her hospital gown , her angel robe , her shroud , her gunnysack . He wanted to take her away from the crowds , that was all . He was ready to take her back . They could n't keep her . Before and after is all life is : that was the only lesson they 'd learned together . B.C. Before Catastrophe . Or Before Courser . Before the Crusher . A.D. After Decapitation . The shop teacher learns a little philosophy between semesters of shellac and mitre boxes : Laura  | before and Laura ever after . Unkindness to himself , to her ? that was the least of his offenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Up with me . " " Okay . " " Do you trust yourself in bed with a horny man ? " She could still shudder , though her anger and disgust were identical . A wave passed through her like wind over rippling water . He could not apologize . " We 'll work on a real bed for you starting tomorrow . " " What about my air mattress ? " " I 'll plug it in . " Circulating air repelled bedsores ; bedsores were something no one took seriously . You could work up a real sense of righteous indignation against the spared , the healthy . You could put up a flag and give lectures in the street . In two hours her flesh would eat a hole in itself ; could n't be simpler . It digested its surface as though anger did it , hot acid pooling . Each bedsore meant a month , three months , of healing . A permanent dent , a scar from the core out . " Thousands of dollars if you can believe it , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . He could n't believe it , of course not ; she only told him improbable things , she liked to enlist what sounded like reason against the unfairness of injury . It made her feel good : virtuous , superior to both of them . Well , they were only free of her , not of what she warned against : how every inch that presses down without movement begins to die . Air , then , or water below her pressure points , those weighty bones , her shoulders , spine and  | buttocks , that was all . " No one is light enough . If she had wings they 'd rot , " said Mrs. Toko smiling . Air , water and constant turning , chicken on a spit . The price of weighing more than dust is pain . He wished Mrs. Toko only the worst . Now he puts his arms under Laura , ready this time for her uneven weight . They stagger on the dark steps , plunge towards the bedroom . He feels like a bear on his hind legs dragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll kill him later . They bump through the doorways , her shoulder against the jamb , taking his fingers along . His wedding ring slashes a long comet-arc in the paint . He tries to sit her on their bed ; she could just as easily flap her wings and fly . " How do we do this , honey ? What should I do ? " He is frightened , humble . Here they are again . " I could fall on the floor for an encore . " " Laura ? " " Well , I do n't know . Lay me down , I guess . You ca n't expect me to sit on the edge like a good little girl . Why do n't you think about it next time ? " It occurs to him as he moves his hands to grasp her for pulling  --  he has shut it out but with this single action it 's clear there will be no choice  --  that they will have to get out of this house . The house is so much his beloved place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air goes out of his body ; he 's fallen on his stomach into that old winded numbness of his childhood . He looks at his wife appalled , as though she 's asked for something he can not give her . Her head is on the pillow , not a good angle for it . It gives her pain . Before she can ask him to remove it , he has lain down beside her , both of them still in their buckles and shoes and belts and sweaters , like teenagers hoping to neck . She realizes after a while that he 's begun to weep . As suddenly as  | Laura folds into tears these days , it has caught him unprepared . His tears feel dry and rusty , it takes a long time for him to pump them up from the well they 've gathered in while he 's watched her cry and cry , with pity and disgust watched the skin soften around her eyes as if she 'd stayed in the bath too long . His tears are stored very far down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; like making love with a stranger , it has its symmetries if one is patient . Soon he is sobbing like a small boy , shoulders , hips , he is bent at the knees with unbudgeable pain ; he moves . He thinks if he stays here forever , breathing out tears , he will never have to face his life . Long after he feels nothing at all the tears go on , the circuit jammed open , comfortable . He understands how Laura finds them useful , how the shifting weathers that sweep violently over her are really a kind of movement , close to the center and far far back ; she has nowhere else to go . She ca n't put her arms around him but , eyes nearly dry , she murmurs , " That 's better , Dan , that 's good . That 's very very good . " Hallie on the potty , Jon on his first bike . He feels slightly sullied , as though he 's masturbated while she lay beside him sleeping . And wo n't it come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Then he gets up and prepares them both , blindly , for sleep . He thought he 'd been catching up with his wife through the years of their marriage . She was patient most of the time and he was hurrying . He was hurrying the day they were sailing up under the flat face of the Palisades in Laura 's cousin Natty Riggs 's boat , his twenty-footer ( the children in love with the bunks and the  | depth sounder , how effortlessly its green numbers flew past as though they did n't really exist ) . They ate hardboiled eggs dark with French mustard and pate , and drank beer out of Natty 's own barrel with its drippy spigot . When Laura and Janet Riggs went down the ladder and horsed in the water their voices were high and adolescent , Janet 's because it always was , she was serving a life sentence as the last debutante in her family , Laura 's because she was happy to be far from Hyland for a while . New York had made her walk swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but like a workingwoman 's , and this kind of swim was one of the things she saw she missed ? not a lake in New Hampshire with passive trees all around , so postcard-beautiful you ought to feel you were on vacation all the time and therefore never did . But that cliff of city down there just out of sight , that furious busyness , that endlessness .. . Because Natty made the mistake of asking , Dan assured him he could steer the boat , who could n't steer , anyone who could drive , he could handle a caterpillar or a Maserati  --  he was hurrying then too , eager to prove a dozen and a half things to this stockbroker cousin of Laura 's , when he grabbed the wheel and danced a little  --  was it a sailor 's hornpipe ? He remembers kicking up , feeling limber . He remembers the wheel was cumbersome , slow to respond . Whatever you did with it , you overdid . ( Why were n't they anchored ? Why was the motor on when there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ) But he was the one who forgot the swimmers , who grabbed the wheel and gave the boat its rush , thinking the surge sounded  --  vroom vroom  --  like the fake sounds he made as a little boy playing power . He will not remember Laura 's voice from beside , from under the boat , in the rotors , nor any of the next few hours . None of it , none of  | it at all , it is buried , he would choose to cover it with his own body if he has to , like a soldier falling on a grenade ; only not to have to think about it , or see it , or hear it , again . Laura knows a thousand things he does n't now and he 'll never catch up . A lot of them hurt , some of them hinge on a strength no one discovers unless the alternative is nothing ; it is not transferable . Dan looks at her as if she 's grown a new set of muscles stronger than the first . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He knows a few things , though , himself , that he is n't telling her . For most of her stay in the hospital she asked no questions , she seemed to need all her energy to breathe . Then her words came back to her one at a time , holey , as if some grid laid over her brain let one word out of every five or ten slip through ; he had to work to hear them . When he talked to her it was n't to impart information so much as warmth , to massage her senses , to get her to reattach herself to him ; no , at first to the life she 'd nearly abandoned and only after that seemed sure , to him . The doctor told him he was her lifeline . He felt incidental , or worse : an irritant , a sty in her one unbandaged eye . No , said the doctor , even anger will do her good , even hate , recrimination , blame . They 'll get her circulation up . So he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when so was she ? ) She was a patchwork of bandages at first . It looked as though they had plans to electrocute her : the Crutchfield tongs held her head in place , massive and loaded with lead weights , stuck tight in holes in her skull . Had they drilled the holes with a squeaky drill , by hand ? The frame of her bed was met with an identical frame and she inside like a sandwich filling . Every few hours the whole thing was turned over and she lay on her stomach looking at the floor . " You could read , " he 'd offered shyly . ( " Danny , who are the people who  | do all that vacation reading you hear about ? " And the children tugged and nattered . ) " I 'll turn the pages . " Her laugh was as thick with bile as a belch . It came from under the bed . Among the things he was n't telling her was where they were living . Natty , in spite of his blazer and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boast and a fraud , was warmer and kinder than his wife , who would n't talk to him . " That could have been me too , you stupid murderer , " she hissed , and he saw that debutantes could turn as ugly as the next one ; nor could she curse as inventively as the least thug in Hyland . " If I had n't been swimming around the other side you could have gotten us both , you fucking ignorant showoff ! " She poured drinks for herself . Was she the only adult in the room ? Natty poured them for Dan and himself and apologized for Janet who , he said , was understandably upset : Laura was one of the few women she liked ; she had a hundred friends she despised . For a week Dan and Jon and Hallie stayed with the Riggses in Oyster Bay , where they lived in a house that was all striped carpeting , hypnotic , orange and yellow like a bathrobe . Janet circled him at a distance as though he might still be dangerous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hated the apartment but thanked Natty nonetheless , he had done the best he could , called everyone he knew and turned up this set of barren rooms only three long blocks crosstown from the hospital . It was n't worth moving , once they were there . Dan had neither the cunning to find anything better nor the energy to care . The front entrance to their building felt like a darkroom . The switchplate they grappled for just inside the door was crusted with fingerprints , three-dimensional with dirt ; they  | were n't allowed to leave the light on . Dan watched the spark jump inside the cracked case each time he turned it on ; it was live as a trapped firefly . The toilet was mossy , the paint on every wall looked like a map revised with a hundred new discoveries . Someone had pencilled the names of states on the bathroom wall . Jon added New Hampshire in a jagged square twice the size of Texas . It  --  that was how they referred to the place , reluctant to speak of " home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children for a month . ( They 'd been hoping for an elevator ? the only one in Hyland was at the hospital , but if you were their age you had to be a patient to get into it . ) Dan had always meant to sit down with pencil and paper and figure out how the steps could go straight up like that without turning ? the building did n't seem deep enough . It was some kind of magic he did n't want to investigate , but he would n't have been much surprised if the steel basement door led through walls and caves into some infinite hollow place at the center of the city . On Sundays all eight million people could come out there and mug one another , or play ball . Where the stair landing had its little plateau deep enough to stand on to catch your breath before you took the next flight , Hallie would sit down defeated . It seemed to be where she went to visit her mother ; she would pull her knees up and stare angrily at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step , at the top of the risers . She would run a finger along the edge till she got to a raised screw , then circle it a few times methodically and go on ; then she would do it again . The first month or so Dan would carry her up the rest of the way . In the vague twilight under the bulb her eyes dilated , they were a witchy black he did n't recognize , empty screwholes bored between herself and everything outside .  | When her leg muscles got strong enough to get her upstairs without exhaustion , still he would find her there . He began to see it was her one sweet hideout , her treehouse , her boulder . School was a torment , half in Spanish , half in a language she was presumed to know but seemed never to have heard before . ( " What does it mean , I was eight before I was seven ' ? " she asked Dan . " A girl , Bunny , in my class says that all the time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys . " ) She had no friends , no bike , no sled , no garden . The trees at home must have begun to turn , she told Dan once when he found her on her step . For her it was sufficient explanation of her presence there in the dark : that her home friends were in the playground standing on their heads , playing poly hockey . They were picking goldenrod and Vermont asters . Did they ever think of her ? Her mother was down the block held captive by spikes in her head , turned with a wheel . Why did he tell her what Laura looked like ? Dan thought it was just as well she could n't go see for herself , it was a mercy , but he told her anyway , blurted it out . Why ? he asked himself . ( Blurt was the word for him , what he said and what he did . Courser the Blurt , king of the smalltown fuckups . ) Hallie woke at night screaming her mother 's scream . Dan sat up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lay warm hands on him before he 'd realize it was not his nightmare he was hearing . Then , barefooted , he would run into the bedroom to comfort her , lay her down beside him , give her body warmth at least . At most . So it seemed as kind as anything else to leave Hallie stretched out in the dark of the stairwell , her back to one wall , feet extended to the other , sneaker tips straight up the bleary green that was black as exhaust with unchallenged shadow . Hallie Lavender was what they called her when she  | was a baby because the name was sweet , old-fashioned , smelled good . Music . Now he left her alone like one more drunk in a doorway . Why not ? They had insurance for Laura , at least so far ; his teacher 's insurance , a bad-luck lottery they 'd won . Flushed with sympathy , the school district was giving him the year on leave . But he needed a job for the rest of them : they were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could steer , who could n't steer , anyone who could drive ( and his little hornpipe ) : he drove a cab , numb enough to do it well . Every morning before work he went to see Laura . For months she pretended to be asleep . It was easy to seem so when nothing moved , awake . When they took the bandages off her face he sat at the edge of her peculiar bed , or the edge of a Jell-Ogreen plastic chair , and touched her with his fingertips . If she was upside down when he came he found some other place where skin could be arrived at simply . Usually she wore no clothes under the sheet . Her shoulders were stitched and scarred in fewer places than he dared believe from the beating of the rotors . He traced a finger across her bare skin ; she could flinch . Still those shoulders made him weak in the solar plexus . He talked to her about Hallie and Jon but censored their misery ; told her about his fares , about events he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News , knowing she 'd rather he read the Times . When it was time to go he bent , careful to put no weight on her delicately restrung bones , and kissed her lips . The mummies at the Metropolitan Museum , to which he 'd dutifully taken the kids  --  the mummies , he thought , would have kissed him back more warmly . " You 've  | got more flinch to the inch , " he said to Laura . " Are n't you jealous ? ? the mummies love me . " He 'd walk back to get his cab , pull a ticket off the windshield wherever he was parked , rip it down the middle , drop it in the nearest can or shove it in the glove compartment . Sometimes he made a plane out of it and flew it nose-first into the gutter . Then he would drive into the New York day , trembling until the violence of the traffic pacified him . t Spring came to New York earlier than to home . It was open season for suicides ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own hands in their own way , in jail cells and double-locked apartments , in penthous " s and garaged automobiles . He had become a student of annihilation , a remote nonpracticing member of a brotherhood . Anyone with a real taste for despair , he decided , had to make it to the city ; Hyland just could n't support a habit like the ones he saw around him . Laura had moved next door , to the Rehabilitation Institute that was an arm ( the immovable arm ! ) of the hospital . Sometimes the kids came , but there was n't much to do once they 'd had their tour of the therapy rooms . They got jumpy and Laura got depressed ; they sat and looked at each other blankly , their children 's lives elsewhere , Laura 's right here . The day before Dan went and told them she was leaving in the morning  --  he issued the news like a holdup threat , there was no appeal but to hand her over  --  he had two encounters in his cab that made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathe deeply enough to hurt , and breathe again . And hurt again . A child of about eight rode with him crosstown , Seventy-  | sixth and Third to Forty-sixth and Eighth : she was on her way , she said , to acting class . She reminded him of Hallie , mostly in the hair but something , too , about the intelligent ready way she held her head , her small pointed chin . Except that she had a voice he 'd never have tolerated in a woman five times her age  --  fake innocent , as if she 'd learned to play a little girl , shrewish and nippy underneath . She earned enough money from one TV commercial , she told him , not even proudly , to buy his taxi out from under him . " It 's not mine to sell , honey , or I 'd give you a good price . " " Tant pis , " she said , tucking her legs up under her like a real child . " You know , you 're not very good at timing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And just at 4:30 , at turn-in time , an elegant old woman pleaded with him to take her to La Guardia . She had stood on the corner of Twenty-ninth and Fifth with her matched bags way out in the street undecided whether to be angry or humble , arguing in a voice worn clear through with age or drink , or both , that she would miss her plane now , that this was the impersonal cruelty , the very cruelty , that had destroyed the city she knew . " You 're right , you 're right , but I got my troubles too , " Dan had called out to her . All he did all day was hear voices , words , the up-and-down of disembodied argument , and now when he worked he sounded like a lifetime New Yorker . How much convenient inflection he had borrowed from his fellow cabbies , the real ones , not the tender visitors  --  that shruggy , combative , casually suffering style , for which he had to open his mouth wide . The old woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was exorbitant . Even with Blue Shield . He could n't tell if it was higher for an amateur like himself or if he only bruised easily . " I go to La Guardia now , my friend ,  | I 'll be home at midnight " was what he told her , enjoying the alien sound of his inflection that protected him at work like a uniform . " No way . You ever see the cabbies lined up out there ? I got kids at home , they need their dinner too . " He did , as he 'd threatened the woman , go home and cook dinner . It was 6:30 , then it was 7:0o and Hallie was n't home . Jonathan had been with her at the skating rink in Central Park . There were a few places they would go , routes they trusted on the subway . They ventured forth carefully like Hansel and Gretel through the dark part of the forest , though never holding hands . The rink , they had told him , was the only place that seemed even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hallie insisted protectively ) , only the crowds were sickening , you could get knocked down , hit and run , and the ice never felt right , it was n't cold enough and it was shredded by too many blades . Still it was made of more familiar stuff than anything else in sight ; they had had their own skates shipped to them , like a letter from home . They 'd wanted one last run , Jon said , before it closed for the season . And Hallie had gone off  --  he 'd met some kids from school who actually seemed glad to see him , they pooled their money and bought hot dogs and one bag of chestnuts between them . He had seen her talking with a youngish-oldish woman , nobody familiar . The woman was sharing a bag of something with her , he could n't tell what it was from the other side of the rink . She looked okay , he said . They were looking at Hallie 's skates . He was happy to see her occupied or she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giggling between him and his  --  friends . She was cool , he said . No sweat . Dan wanted to throttle him .  | " Did she have any money to get home ? " Jon shrugged . His eyes were darkening a shade with the beginnings of concern . " Did she know how to get home , for godsake , does she know where she 's going ? She 's a little girl , Jon . " " I know she 's a little girl . " He gave up his vague defiance . " I was talking to my friends . " He thought hard . " You told us if we ever got lost we could go up to a cop . " Dan did n't say anything about the hundred circumstances that could prevent an eight-year-old girl from finding a cop . But Jon could n't describe the woman . She was n't young , she was n't old . She was wearing a sweatshirt or something like that , with printing across the front , but he could n't read it . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , was she transparent ? Jesus ! " None of it was the kind of thing Jon noticed  --  if she 'd been a car , he 'd have known her blindfolded . Dan felt himself break into a fever ; not sweat , nothing he could wipe away . It was an inner burning , a terror for Hallie and an embarrassment for himself : what will I say , what will I tell them ? Another mortification . Nobody 's allowed two catastrophes . Only a demon would ask such a question , he thought , put it first , worry about it now . He ran downstairs , through the steep dark right over Hallie 's place in the middle of the stairway . Halfway down the block he realized Jon was running behind him , crying out to wait . Could n't he keep his mind on two children at once ? Laura was the one who was good at coping with emergencies , he was master only of the emergencies of others , of the whole damn town of Hyland . The Rescue Squad squawker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambulance calls , sometimes it roused him out of bed , but they were impersonal , those crises , not of his own making . He loved fire calls at two in the morning at 200 below ; the howling of  | the whistle sounded like a faraway train . And he could help grandly , it was his only philanthropy . His own emergencies reduced him  --  what was the word they used for Laura 's spine ? ? comminuted  --  reduced him to fine powders .. . He hailed a cab . It looked just like his own , his company 's . He probably knew the driver . But he was lying low . He slumped in back , his arm around Jon , clenched , making deals with himself that he knew were juvenile and all one-sided : if I find her , if she 's still there . Then what ? Would he never leave them again ? Could he forbid them to go out and live their lives ? There were Puerto Rican kids in their classes who were imprisoned after school , Hallie told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets , nobody home to take care of them . Stealing hubcaps , purses . Whatever moved . " No , " said Hallie with a little stamp of her foot , " those are different kids , these kids sit and watch television all afternoon in the dark . They look out the window . There 's one on our block , Enery , sometimes I wave to her up in the window . She 's in fourth grade . Probably that 's what makes some of them terrible the rest of the time . " Probably . Smart girl . He held his breath the way he still did when he passed the graveyard on Route 8 , his childhood habit : Nothing bad will happen if I hold it to the corner . Help me , help me , he pleaded to no one but himself . Help Hallie . Last time he tried this  --  Help Laura  --  it had n't worked . They got off on the Fifth Avenue side and ran through the park . " Maybe they 'll knife us and finish us off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by looking up all the time as if for protection . Courser the Crusher here , kid , do n't look up at me . The rink was deserted . Its ruined ice gleamed dull and bluish under the streetlamps , scarred everywhere with shadows . It felt like a fairground after the fair 's moved on .  | " Jon , I could kill you for this , " Dan said without looking at his son . He was scouring the horizon : blue-black trees , blue-black sky . The ESSEX HOUSE lights glittering out of nowhere . " Why is it my fault , I only ? " " You only ? " But then , " Sssh , " he told him , finger to his lips so as not to disturb someone . Something . He did n't know what . " Never mind . Jesus , do n't cry , what good is that going to do . " He held his son against him , tight . He was not the one to throw stones these days . Would n't Laura laugh . As dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aglare with light , all its bulbs naked . There was an endless clatter and dull commotion , metal chairs on wooden floors and heavy feet in official black shoes , all of it amplified by Dan 's desperation . The desperation made him strangely quiet , though ; he must seem cool , even indifferent . He watched himself being inspected , saw the questions revolving in the bleak routineglazed eyes of the interrogating cop , whose name tag said O'Heare . Drugs ? he was silently asking himself , riffling his little deck of nasty possibilities . Foul play ? Dan 's open shirt collar was being assessed , his grey slipover under his parka . Money here ? Kidnapping ? O'Heare inquired after his wife . " In the hospital , " Dan said . " That 's why we 're here , we really live in New Hampshire . " Country cousin , O'Heare must have been thinking . Poor bastards do n't know what 's out there . Who do you think gets raped , gets taken for a ride , gets rolled ? ' fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the window , she knows . " In the hospital , " said O'Heare and wrote it down slowly , dutifully , pressing hard to get it through all his copies . " Sick ? " Dan looked away . " Accident . She 's crippled . " " Un huh , " O'Heare said and took another quick look at him .  | " What was she wearing ? " Laura ? A sheet . The cop looked so weary , Dan asked him , " This kind of thing happens a lot , hunh  --  kids disappear-ing ? ? " " Coat ? Dress , slacks ? " He raised his hands in despair . " I do n't know , they get dressed themselves , I 'm already  --  I go to visit my wife in the morning " Her blue jacket , " Jon offered , standing on his toes in front of the high desk . " She did n't have her hat , she left it in school . " " What else ? " Jon hung back . " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice . " He put his heels down on the floor again , defeated . O'Heare made slash marks on his multicopy sheet . He looked exasperated . " Well , Jesus , would you know ? " Dan asked him . He had n't planned to defend himself . " Do you know what in the hell your kids wear in the morning ? If I asked you right now , would you know ? " It may have been a fair question but the policeman would never acknowledge it . It did n't take very many words to turn relations gritty in this place . He would not like to have seen what O'Heare was thinking about him ; he and Janet Riggs and Laura would all agree he was a dangerous man , to be watched . Count the accidents , do n't count the good ordinary days of his life , they would whisper . Something 's the matter with a man things happen to . If they did n't find Hallie he could imagine O'Heare going to his house and giving orders to search the apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the locked steel basement door he pretended held back the other eight million who knew how to take care of themselves .  | They rode home in silence . Jon went to sleep in Dan 's bed , looking for comfort . Dan drank two six-packs in very little time and fell asleep in his least comfortable chair . He woke up so engorged with beer he almost did n't make it to the bathroom . But there was that single blessed minute of reprieve between waking and flinging back the toilet seat , letting go , before he remembered Hallie was gone . Everything was before and after , okay , it was true but he thought he 'd already learned that lesson . His life was becoming one long catastrophic event punctuated only by numb forgetting while he slept or dealt with his brainless body . The sound of the beer hitting the side of the bowl was like a hiss of disapproval . He made Jon go to school ; he was too sore for company . Skinless , he sat beside the phone . He called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a bad cold . He called the police who told him they had found a girl aged approximately eight  --  found how ? alive ? whole ? ? but it did n't seem to be a good match . He had n't had a picture to show them , how did they know what would make a good match ? He was about to be belligerent . " Does your daughter have a gold front tooth ? " He breathed again . " You do n't have to call us , Mr. Courser , " they said . He did n't tell them he had no trust in them . He stood at the window looking down on the street , its many shades of grey , real and accumulated . Which building held the captive child after school ? Could she see him from where she was kept packed away like a precious stone ? He was touched , thinking Enery , Energy , Enery , seeing her pacing in her cage . Who in the world , except her parents , would think of that kid , whoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he volunteered , deep in his stricken parts , robbed and helpless , to stand watch with them over their child .  | He slept , woke with his teeth clenched so hard his whole jaw hurt , slept again , going off in a sickening etherish wave of excess sleep that was useful only for forgetting . At one o'clock , after a good deal of fumbling , a key turned in the lock and Hallie walked in looking at the floor . She was wrapped in a faded blue and white Fordham sweatshirt , her jacket gone . ( So was her undershirt ; it was a blessed while till he discovered that . ) She answered him in monosyllables that had the quality of shock to them , or extreme guilty sullenness , how could he tell ? She was as uninformative as an adolescent girl when her father provokes her with questions that are n't his business ; or that she wishes were n't . Hallie who was no hider . He wanted to examine her , to run his fingers all around and in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baby 's nor a teenager 's . As gently as he could , trying to suppress his anxiety , he asked , " Hal , will you come see a doctor with me ? Please ? " He got the response the doctors down the block had hoped for when Laura was in her twilight state  --  anger , at least , made her quicken . " Daddy , what 's the matter with you ? There 's nothing wrong with me except I 'm sleepy . That 's all . " " Did n't you sleep last night ? Did n't they let you get any rest ? " His jaws ached with anger . " They , ' what They ' ? I do n't know why you 're flapping around like that . " He was n't flapping but he made himself sit down and be quiet . But waiting did n't help . She lay down on the couch , turned to the side so that her back was to him , her face hidden in the crook of her arm , and was instantly asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small , cozily rounded woman . From where he watched , in fact , everything was floating off , just out of reach . His friends were a lifetime away ; after today it was more than one lifetime . How could it be they 'd  | been part of him forever ? It was easy to forget why they were here : a day without his visit to Laura and even she drifted off to the corners of his memory . Before she died his mother had complained of " bits and pieces " floating around in her eyes ; they were n't anything , she said , just rods and circles and dark shapes splitting off everything she looked at . It was her sight that was disintegrating , that was all . When he closed his eyes , faces , whole moving bodies , and Laura unmoving , shifted nervously behind them , cruising like fish in a tank . It was no dance , he knew ; it was his life disintegrating . He had to go to Laura and plead with her to tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her sweet lap  --  hers and his mother 's were equally beyond him now , foreclosed , untouchable in their various grown-over graves . Was she going to live in public forever ? That was the question . They did n't allow laps over there . Deltoid muscles , biceps , triceps , laterals and pectorals , but nothing so intimate and undiscussable as a lap ; nor anything so demanding of care or openness or ordinary affection as a husband . No one was allowed to need but the patient , why could he not understand that ? Why did he fight them ? They invited him to nurse her like the martyred mothers who lived in , or just about . Thank God he had a living to make . Her lap ? " Her lap is functional as a shelf now , you see , where she may rest her hands and her devices . " She was theirs . No one 's first and after that theirs . When Hallie woke it was getting dark , the room seemed to be sinking into a vat of blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slammed doors in the kitchen , Jon was watching a screen devoted to Martians and cows who seemed to be sniffing each other with equal suspicion , and no wonder . Hallie walked into the kitchen in her stocking feet . She had no air of mystery about her , only a vaguely chastised quietness .  | Dan put a pot of water on the narrow stove , for the endless spaghetti , and took her gently by the shoulders . There was some authority he could still muster , though he was down to the dregs . " Hallie Lavender , if you 'll look right at me I 'll tell you something good . " She thought about it , afraid , leaning her forehead into his buttons . " Hal ? ? " She squinted at him , trying not to look straight into his eyes . Now she had her portion of guilt , he thought . The year the Daniel Courser family of Hyland , New Hampshire , giving each other a shove where they could , learned to grovel . And God knows what else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you think I know that ? So we 're going to go get her tomorrow . And then what do you think ? " Before her next of kin disintegrates . Let her doctor and her therapist join hands and howl ! Before we all turn into Missing Persons . " And then we 're going home . " He never broke promises . Now they would have to . The sun does not come into the kitchen in the morning ; winter at the breakfast table . Dan nurses his coffee mug , hands splayed around it to get some warmth . Shadowy as it is , it 's better than East Twenty-second Street . It is eight o'clock ; he is exhausted . The alarm has ripped through him three times since midnight , once when he was swimming in an endless pool , losing a race to a girl he 'd known in high school who was built like a boy and in the dream swam naked , as the boys did . As she passed him , flooding his face with water , her breasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said a word to him but he did n't hear it . " What ? " he called out . " What did you  | say ? " but the alarm was dragging him up out of the water , dry . I am dreaming : Riding to the funeral parlor together , a family-full . I almost knew their faces . The car thick , muffled in silence . That blank echo of snow just stopped falling . Mother was going with us , we would wait for her to finish her dying when we got there . She did not complain . They met her at the open door and took her away gently into a room as though she were the mother of herself , who needed comforting . We in the lobby , then in one of the chapels , an aimless animal milling , rehearsing the funeral before her death . They , helping her across the last single minutes of her death expertly and discreetly behind the door . A man came walking across the endless carpet to us all . He took my hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in front . The back door , a screen-slam . The coffin door . Somebody says they built these houses with an eye to everything . There was no surprise in it . We had brought her here . The graveyard was the lovely shadowy old Tremont Street burying ground I 've walked through a hundred times , thick with the dark and modest stones of Boston 's famous families , Adams and Hopkins and Chauncy . Endless roar of cars gunning at the stoplight . A net of exhaust fell across us as we walked , we were greying everywhere . My deepest mourning that she would be buried here in a wind of candy wrappers . She lay on top of the coffin , tilted , on a mound of grey  | carved flowers , but on her side , curled almost , comfortable , a hand under her cheek . The sight of the arms , familiar , still vibrating warm in old blue blouse-sleeves with cuffs I remember turning twenty years ago and I heard a cry from my own throat : No , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent the whole of my sight looking down at them , their shape , the way the little hairs lie . And it was real , I was here , my arms bent sleeping . They were stiffer . Heavier . My wrists were hardening to stone . Someone , weeping suddenly , made a widow-sound , a move like lunging to throw herself in the gravehole , and I blinked my heavy eyes open to see who had ever loved me so . The cool air hurt my face . Are there embalmer 's holes where the blood 's sucked out ? I know there was only a cold space for a nose . Then that voice crying out , running forward . Rough arms around me , small , raising me from my hard bank of flowers . My lids blinking against the cold . My pained face forward to see . " You 're alive ! " Shaking me . " Mommy ? " Sitting up slowly there , all ruined holes , seeing the streaky red then green of the streetlight at the corner , I sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no cold shiny eternal equipment umbilical to keep me up . I could sit and sit unencumbered , I only had to die first for a while . Waking among the stones free , my bare arms poked pale out of the rolled sleeves . The wind , finger by finger , was playing my face like a wooden flute . Laura lay beside him with a pillow behind her , a pillow between her knees , her ankles . She was awake , staring into the dark . He turned her to her other side , rearranged her legs and put the pillow back beneath the pointy bones . In the  | watery light just showing around the edges of the window , this was no more real or unreal than anything else in the world . If he bore down and thought about where he was , how Laura slept beside him , pieces of a jigsaw puzzle dropped and carefully put back together , a few small pieces lost ; how if he lay up against her clenched in the good old way , melting back to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Mrs. Toko would shake her finger and scold . ) Well , it had already begun to come loose anyway , when his mother died . How could he live in a world that she was not awake in ? It unravelled , row after row of certainties , expectations , assumptions of how things should be ; the threads came loose and dangled , connecting nothing . Nothing , apparently , had to be . His mother , Harriet Wardwell Courser , small and a little round , not the dieting kind , short-haired , nervous , kinder to her children than to herself , was and then was not . The world rushed on either way . Now he thought of her mostly at night ; hauntings like that must become the ghosts grownups believe in . A chill sun is going to crack through any moment ; it will wash the yard with light . The children will get their bowls of Cheerios and go watch a cartoon . The world does not consult you to . find out if you think it 's real . Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; when , that is , she acknowledges that her eyes are open , the morning ritual will begin : swipe of the washcloth , teeth done with an electric toothbrush , basin held under her chin ; two kinds of elimination , one coerced , the other accomplished in a dozen separate steps , a matter of purging and making pure , of tinkering . He boils water in the biggest pot , to sterilize the irrigation equipment . He suspects it is no longer sterile when he gets it to her : does n't air contaminate ? Then there is the  | business of dressing . She can help by flinging her shoulder about like the jib of a sailboat , can facilitate the matter of pushing her arms into an orange and brown blouse she has directed him to pull out of her valise , which is still packed as if she is only stopping over . This time he thinks it out first , carries her chair into the kitchen , picks her up knowing enough to dread the walk down the narrow stairs . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder against the inner wall , panting . " What would happen if you weighed twenty pounds more ? " ( Watching her at the pond with the other women : how compact she is , no stomach kneaded out of shape by the babies , no veiny pulpy thighs . Bending over Billy 's rowboat , looking for Jon 's sneaker , the perfect arc she makes . " A dancer 's responsible for every part of herself , " she had told him early on , " no outlying provinces unaccounted for . " She 'd wiggled her fingers and toes . Billy sits holding an oar across his lap . Dan gets the back view , tight and smooth , and Billy takes in the deep shadow between her breasts . He is too proud of her to mind ; in real life poor Billy has Louise . After he 's had enough of a look , Billy pulls Jon 's sneaker out from under the seat and hands it to her , barely smiling . ) Dan makes breakfast silently , concentrating . There is toast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she raises her hand precisely . Everything depends on flexors and extensors . Without them , he thinks , vaguely amused , what would there be ? No wars , no bowling . Her hands are better than some because she wears a strip of plastic for a brace  --  color of old-fashioned eyeglasses , color of his mother 's , in fact , never exactly the shade of anyone 's flesh ; when they rest on the arms of the chair they appear to be at peace , waiting , not heavy with immobility ; that brokenwinged crippled look shows only in movement . She manages  | to get the toast up , though she makes angles Dan would rather not have to look at . She manages a certain neatness he can barely aspire to , though , with all his limbs flexing and extending . She pats her mouth with her napkin ; approximately her mouth . A few crumbs remain , and a gloss of butter on one cheek . He has seen her do all this before , silently , sullenly , at the Institute ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression that might be seen on some captive 's face when her master stops by to see how the stone-chipping goes . Now the first square patch of sunlight passes into the kitchen just beyond the foot pedals of her wheelchair . The children have gone out to play on the lawn . They seem to go out a lot . He should take them into town today to see their friends . ( It is a school day , he remembers . Later then . ) It takes her fifteen minutes to eat her piece of toast and wipe her cheek . She sips her coffee lukewarm through a very long straw . Once , at the Institute , when she picked up a glass  --  however she managed to , in her paws  --  the weight of it tipped her over . " I 'll give you your choice , Dan , " she says to him now , looking at the sun patch that 's about to arrive at her feet like a spotlight . " Laugh or congratulate me , either one . Nothing you can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast this way . " These words are the most inviting she has said to him in months . Every part of him lurches as if the kitchen floor has become a deck in rough weather . There is a cold wind blowing on his feet . " Goddamn kids left the front door open , " he says and rushes to close it . When he comes back he tries to do the last half hour over again , this time without the awkwardness . He would say he knows the risk ; nonetheless he tells Laura , " Well , you always wanted to slow down , honey . Second cup of coffee , a  | little music . You want some music ? " He makes for the radio , smiling . She will know bitterness when she sees it . But she is looking at him as if she may or may not know him , though he is standing in her kitchen , leaning his elbows on the counter and twisting the dial of the radio , stopping at the overexcited voices of disk jockeys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise , moving off , then , into a long spill of Muzak . " Lousy , " he mutters and turns it off . " Save you the trouble of objecting . " His face is redder than she has ever seen it . He looks straight at her . " Damned if I do and damned if I do n't , right ? " Laura 's eyes narrow a little . She knows him . " Get a taste of it , " she says . Secretly I breathe in , hold , breathe out , hold , breathe in . Dan 's head darkens for me . Fading color , a nimbus around his shoulders , light withdrawing . Stipple and shadow , black against white , flashing . White against black . Goddamn him , I will not faint in my own kitchen . I will not faint . When I was two or three or four years old , I would hold my breath . Everything darkened . The way the movies go dim before the curtains open : light sucked away . I would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? maybe it was only a minute  --  but I 'd be safe , on the other side of whatever made me angry . It was a going blind . My body going blind . Even if the sun barely penetrates the kitchen Dan loves the room ; he loves every room in the house and , after a boyhood of wardrobes and boxes and piles of clothes against the  | wall , loves every one of its numerous closets . Every time he has stashed something in one of them or in the basement or the high solid attic , he 's said the same thing : " They 'll never get us out of this place alive . With a crowbar , in a coffin , but not walking . " Could this be the same man who came through the jimmied windows of those camps and exclaimed over the opulence of those second sets of dishes ? Everything he had he stole into then ; now  --  before the qualification of the present ? he has had Laura , has had a job going into its seventh year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadiness ; he has a house that still astounds him . His wife and his house , in fact , seem to him to have come on the same lucky gene : given more than earned , though not entirely given . Good luck is as perplexing as bad , he is willing to consider that  --  responsibility may be braided somewhere into it , obscurely ; or may not be . ( Laura has told him that an ability to think two things at once is a form of higher thought , intellectual capability . Some of his Neanderthal friends , she says , can barely handle one . Does she respect confusion and uncertainty ? She uses the word " ambivalence , " or " ambiguity , " the word " complexity " : it is apparently the highest compliment she can pay anything , that it is forked , divided , irresolute . That it is debatable . Dan has lived two-thirds of his life among emphatic men ; maybe the women are always something else but the men , right or wrong , meant what they meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half-assed , some physical mockery of men . They stepped hard and frequently smashed what they stepped on . ) The house was in the family ; the family , like most , had branches so unlike one another it seemed inconceivable they shared the same roots . Many by now were total strangers . Dan knows there is a Courser in the legislature ; there is a genteel painter of great local fame , Queen of the Gift Shoppes , named  | Aimee Courser de la Petre , which gets the Courser pronounced Coor-say . Then there was Kenton Courser , long gone , and Uncle John who had an automobile seat for a couch and pigs living under his trailer . Dan lived , he guessed , somewhere near the exact middle of the spread of the Courser fortunes . ( What was his work , seven years in the shop department at the Hampshire River High School ? Neither white nor exactly blue , he called his job grey-collar . ) The year of their marriage , his Aunt Jemmie had taken a cursory look at Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , Laura complained , like those of a horse ; had identified , or so she thought , an ally against the more wretched , if democratic , tendencies of the Working Coursers , the nonworking Coursers , the farm and mill Coursers ; had rewritten her will to bequeath her house to the newlyweds on condition that they make no significant changes beyond what was minimally necessary to secure their comfort . Then , rather than put herself to the trouble of dying , she removed herself to an alternative home in Palm Beach , where the winters were more considerate of the limitations of age . To Dan and Laura in the vigor of their youth and health she left the boorish New Hampshire weather and the house . Once in a while she wrote them cheerful postcards , Mediterranean blue shoreline and unreal Everglades birds hanging out their wings to dry in the perpetual sunlight ; she inquired after the health of the house as if it were some dear chronic invalid relative entrusted to their care . They wrote back in more detail than she hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only the children , sitting on the rim of the well or balanced too precariously on the stone wall on one foot apiece , were allowed to change : they were true to her will . Aunt Jemmie 's house was very old  --  only 120 years older than she , not so very impossible to imagine , really  --  and it  | must have been elegant from the start , must have belonged to a family with pretensions , otherwise it would never have had such high ceilings or been set so far back from the road . It was still and always would be referred to as the General Bolt house by the Friends of the Hyland Historical Society . It might be a Courser place forever , Dan could remake it into an igloo or a hacienda ; still it would revert  --  snobbery , pride , he could n't say which but it redounded to his credit one way or the other and delighted him . General Jonas Bolt had ridden out to a single battle in the War of 1812 and then , for obscure reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back again without having dirtied his uniform . Possibly he did n't deserve to be remembered as a general , but as a builder he had accomplished a work of such nobility of lines ( " like a horse ? " suggested Laura again ) that there were times , angles , from which Dan saw the house  --  say , from the garden , looking up from the turned row that was receiving a handful of carrot seeds  --  that made him stop and stare , humbled . It was no cottage but a monument . A fine , ample , unpretentious , unadorned , thoroughly conventional monument of its time , probably , but anyone who 'd built as much as Dan knew true proportion when he saw it , and grace , and permanence . General Bolt had seen to the raising of the giant summer beam and the laying of the fireplace arch in the basement that looked like a quarter of a Roman aqueduct . He had buried his two wives in the back pasture under what was now a crude tractor shed , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had rarely been troubled by concerns with history and the ironies of time passing , but the house and his rightful , legal , documented ownership of it were enough to impress and incite him to learn what his history teachers had despaired of teaching him .  | He could see the general , who was really a farmer , bending over his own row of carrots , of feed corn , broom corn for his wife and daughters to gather together to sweep the hearth with . He could see the wagon parked in the shed , and the same mountain , unmoving , teased by clouds , out the twelveon-twelve side windows . Somewhere along the line the Bolt and Courser families joined ; eventually there were a dozen Courser houses and this was only one . It had got away from the family for a while and was brought back into the fold around the turn of the century . Widowed Aunt Jemmie closed off half the house and raised two daughters in the rest , and they went west with husbands . ( She 'd had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who held on to land . ) So the dark horse got it , the youngest nephew , the one who had married class back into the family . ( Clearly Aunt Jemmie thought Laura was insane for marrying a Courser , but that madness was the only shortcoming Aunt could see . ) John , his brother , fumed and kicked stones , but it was John 's misfortune , perpetually , that for every stone he brutalized he had only a bruised toe to show for it . He inherited the smallest of the Courser houses , a straightforward little Cape with no charm and no elbow room . Dan installed a dozen lightning rods , rewired , replumbed , painted the whole huge hulk with forty gallons of primer and good barn-red paint , reaching from a terrifying ladder ; sanded the floors ; polished the innards of its central chimney till the old handmade bricks gleamed . He listened for voices in the walls , discovered an 185o newspaper stuck sideways to the back of a closet and read it off with something like pride , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boutelle , dentist of Concord , was discovered mortally wounded at the side of the Manchester and Lawrence Railroad Co. tracks approaching his  | native town , on the north side . CHOLERA INFANTUM  --  No mother need ever mourn the death of her child by that infantdestroying complaint when TEETHING in warm weather ! There was a choice of rooms for everything . He felt like Goldilocks , deciding all the time . The first few times he and Laura made love there , he speculated , filled with a wonderfully augmented , magnified , strangely anonymous ardor , on the sexual habits of General Bolt and his first consort Molly , the wife of his youth . " They must have slept up here , it 's the logical room for the Parents of the House , is n't it ? Even then ? " A shrug from Laura . " Eight kids , cold winters , all that nursing , all those clothes  --  in and out , before she knew it , I 'll bet . Consider yourself lucky , woman . " Laura seemed to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor woman died at forty-one , honey , ca n't you let her old ghost rest ? " " She 's had a hundred and seventy-five years to rest . " " But she never thought the kind of thoughts you 're thinking , you terrible man . You 're part of the Licentious Generation , do n't you know that ? Women like Molly Bolt , Beloved Consort , were n't allowed ? " But Dan said " Bullshit " to that . " You think we discovered laughing in the dark ? " It was the only instance he knew where he opted for complexity and shading and Laura , strangely modest and unmoved , let things be : maybe because they were his people ? The secret lives of his relatives , the passions beneath the nightcaps and flannel gowns , the stirrings of dream and feeling in those suppressed hardworking dutiful people who were also  --  elegant ? ambitious ? " Human , " he said to Laura , disturbed and stimulated , profoundly so . " Human . " Laura was amused . She thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was making up for it with cliches . Kenton Courser was not an ancestor worth speculating  | on ; he was more like a derelict son . But Dan said no , that was n't it . The house had spirits in it , the residue of all the love and work of two hundred years . The candles dipped , wicks trimmed , tomatoes canned , turnips buried for the winter . Thousands of everything , year in , year out , everything chafing : feet on the doorstep that had still not begun to wear it down ; feet on the hearth , the thresholds . The size and shape of the rooms memorized , moved through . The black wrought-iron brace on the front of the fireplace would never buckle . Never : if the house fell in around it , it would hold . The cellar stairs , those half-logs , pegged , still spiny with splinters . Maybe it had to do with working with your hands , Dan said , with tools , with all the stubborn materials you had to prod and make into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building to last . If every movement or passion evaporated in its instant .... He thought of his mother who ate dinner in her apron , whose red hands never healed . " I think I hear religion nudging the old Courser atheism somewhere , " Laura teased him . " Do n't tell me your Daddy went to hell for nothing . " " Not religion but , I do n't know . " Some kind of memory ? " Listen , why are you laughing , that 's not fair . Here I am trying to be serious , but you only like it when I 'm serious about your subjects . Jesus , Castro . Ingmar Bergman ! Why are you making me defend myself ? " So he was left alone with the extra dimension of his love for the house . Laura appreciated its size , certainly , its appointments , the fine presence of it , turned towards the sun on its small knoll above the road , so that it was easy to drive past and never see it . At night , lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves , a ship on which a party was always raging in full light . But she seemed purposely unsentimental about its history . She had the house off Brattle Street , maybe  | one house was all you reasonably had the energy to love ? Dan fingered the forged iron , the door hasps , tried to date the feathering on the living room walls ( made with a cross-cut saw , which means renovation after 185o ? ) and went on meditating on the imagined personalities and faces of his ancestors , dozens of Bolts and Coursers , Voigts and Conners , with a fierce pride . He shared the house with them . He was their loving tenant . Amputation : to cut away the thresholds . To hack at the doorways . The front step ? The stairs ( there are four stairways in the General Bolt house , two steep , two gentle ) . The kitchen doorway is like the neck of an hourglass , wide at both ends , pinched in the middle . The house is on a hill , a curve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and curve just severe enough so the town has placed a sand barrel on its side on the margin of the uphill lane . When there 's enough snow down to need it , it ca n't be found under the drifts the plow has made . He sees Laura rolling down the hill in the barrel ; at the foot of the hill , the cars stop at the blinking light to let her through . " Oh it 's only Laura Courser going shopping , " they say . " Look how she gets around . Is n't it wicked ? " ) They would do better in Uncle John 's trailer , pigs and all . Dan looks out the window at the dwindled woodpile . One of the early Coursers ( when this , where he 's sitting , was the summer kitchen , the keeping room ) was blind . He had knelt in the soil and fingered his way down the furrows , trying to get his crops in straight . He sang in public with two blind brothers , his first wife left him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he killed himself ; it is unclear , shadowed , in the box marked COURSER in the temperature-controlled records room at the Historical Society . Laura has sharp eyes  | for him , but look , he had her fingers ! Collaboration over time . What a match . In the long history of the world they 've only missed each other by a blink . Unfair ! She will wheel herself down the long living room soon and come to the kitchen door , between cabinets , the neck of the hourglass , and she will want to pass through . He drove a truck one summer and got it caught in an overpass . How they cursed him . He skinned the whole top of the truck off , peeled it back and left it naked . Jesum Crow , said John , next time want us to lift the bridge ? Rich Laura  --  but this is cruel and he chases after it to throttle it down  --  will get stuck in the eye of the needle . He chases the thought ( which comes with a flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not catch it . I sent Jon to the basement to look for the blacksnake family that comes with spring . " Too late , " he said , more or less , " or too early or moved or died . " I 'd have gone down to visit the snake mother , shiny as water , and her long babies . Shown her myself on my stomach , how close we 've come . She always liked to stay near the wall but it was n't enough , Jon . Nothing is . John Courser is taller , thinner , more pallid than his brother . He has a high narrow forehead and a worried manner . To Dan he has always looked like an unhappy intellectual . In fact he is a severe and nervous man as he was a severe and nervous boy , not much fun , prone to secrecy , headaches and an improbable morality . He is no intellectual . As it happens , though , his frown impresses employers , bank managers , all  | those bureaucrats whose job it is to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The consensus seems to be that anyone who looks so burdened must be tending to his business . He has not done badly ; in fact , having convinced these people to give him mortgages , loans , credit ratings , John has begun to have some confidence in his powers . Most of his life it has been his clown brother who has charmed himself behind locked doors . John owns the gas station at the foot of Route 8 and Mill Circuit Road where he is reported to be able to fix anything on wheels , cheap , honest , fast . The station has John 's cheerless look , though . Laura hates it and insists it is n't snobbery : the place , she says , is blighted by its earnestness , as if adornment were cheating . For all its business , it looks abandoned . John has the unfrivolous zeal of a fundamentalist , but no religion and not much holy joy . This morning he is at Dan 's door . He has not bothered himself to distinguish between concern and curiosity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Laura 's sake . " Hey Buz , " his brother says , the door half open . " How 'd you know we were home ? " ( Buz is short for Buzzard , the name John gave to himself as a child because he had no hunting luck , never caught anything , never even got anything to slow down . ) " Danny , " John says , getting right to it . " How 's your wife ? " John is embarrassed to say Laura 's name and always has been , so that Dan has sometimes wondered if what ties him up right there is a little charge of feeling , like a shot of scotch , warm , sudden and over with . " She 's fine . " He shrugs . " Considering . " They are standing at the threshold . " Ca n't I come in and say hello ? " Dan makes a small uncontrollable movement of defense .  | " She 's  --  not altogether up yet , I would n't  --  it 's quite a production . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait till a decent hour . " " What if I call you . Maybe you and Donna . " " I 'll be at work . " " Well , later . Tonight . " John takes a long look at his brother , trying to imagine how wrecked Laura could be that he needs to be so pathetic and evasive and insulting . The idea of Dan 's guilt arouses strong feelings in him which make him sigh , a long irritated exhalation , like that of a horse . It is more complicated than comforting to have your worst fears confirmed . " Dan , look , let me say hello to her . I 've got to see her sometime . " He forces through his clenched reticence as simple a smile as he can manage . " Does n't she need some cheering up ? " " Why in the hell are you so eager to see her ? " John realizes now how tense he is , how every part of him is a fist . He is shocked at the bareness of the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fella , do I have to have some special reason to want to see how she is ? " " I just told you how she is . " Dan wants to say " Off limits to you now , is n't she , baby . " He wants to say " Do n't gloat in my doorway , Buzzard . Are n't you glad I finally got mine . " It occurs to him , though , that John will not gloat in Laura 's presence . He is not that unkind . " All right , come say hello . Maybe she 'd like that , she does n't have much to do . " " Thanks , " John says , but he 's not adept at sarcasm and sounds grateful . He follows his brother in . Dan wants to inflict what pain he can ; he says nothing to prepare John . Laura is on the sunporch facing the windows that are silvery with light . Her idleness is like an occupation , it takes her full attention . Dan watches his brother stiffen at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once : that he manage not to make her unhappy and that he say some outrageous thing that will earn him the right to be k.o. ' d right there , bloodily , arm pinned , knee in his gut . When they were teenagers John broke his collarbone and would not be sorry . They 'll settle up someday . John and Laura are talking . Although there is a chair to sit in , John is squatting in front of her , holding her hand quite casually ; as if it is n't hard to touch her . Laura 's face is pink and mobile , it makes the face she shows Dan look like a putty mask . She seems to be telling his brother , quietly , there were a thousand more things she could have learned if she 'd stayed in New York . John is a mechanic ; he is asking mechanical questions . Then he says something Dan ca n't hear . From the back his head bobs as if he 's nodding . " Well , he did a real Dan , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The characteristics of a " Dan " appear to be familiar , ridiculous , a matter of public history . He feels as if he 's eavesdropping . John gives him the big brother 's eye . John would frown if he were feather-tickled on the soles of his feet . " Sounds like somebody told you to get out of town by sundown . " " You could say that . " But he is going to hold his ground . He has swallowed the evidence : Hallie 's defection , his helplessness . " I did what was best for all of us . " But this has no conviction in the absence of the facts . They have closed ranks . John kisses the top of Laura 's cropped head ( though he has never before ventured near her ) and raps her shoulder reassuringly as if she were a pitcher in the middle of a bad inning , but one to whom he 's just given the advice and the spirit to get out of it alive . He walks to the  | door without a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You seem to know each other pretty well . " " This is really the time for your routine jealousies , " Laura says without much passion . " You still sound like you 've borrowed a television script , a really rotten lousy one , from some kind of show we never watch . You seem to know each other pretty well . ' Why do n't you leer at me when you say that ? Imagine our secret passion , all these years . " She hangs her head , chin on her chest , a massive movement in her rapt unmoving . " All this thing is proving to me is that you do n't have any style . No style at all . " " I did n't know you married me for my style . " He offers his weak defense stiffly . " But if you want to talk about style , I always thought my brother was n't one of your favorite people . " He is feeling more and more exposed : why is he standing on this ledge , caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were . And now that you 're not ? " What ? he thinks . And now what ? Who finishes that sentence , and how ? He stands beside her , facing the same window through which a bleached sun sends its harshest light . He watches , weary , as she tries to do her little dance , the closest she 'll come to one , her weight shift to relieve one sitting cheek and then the other . She straightens her arms to their full length , elbows locked , and leans forward on them , hangs there . Air , nothing , half an inch of cool relief against her flank . The stomach muscles she does n't have must quiver ; the memory of them . She is gasping with the effort . " Do you want some help ? " " I do n't want anything , thank you . " Her dignity has no dignity in it , it is mere blunt courage :  | stepping down hard on sharp splintered bone . Something is stalled but is going to begin . His impatience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make it happen . Even endings begin . He knows she would leave him if she could . He knows it 's supposed to be the other way around . Why did I have to survive myself ? Let me be one of the casualties no one would dare call " courageous " and " noble . " Courageous and noble hurt too much . . . . Let them put me away somewhere and mourn me and be done . I could rest , he could rest , someone would turn the key and separate us once and for all and then I would be his late Laura . Non compos mentis . Non compos corpus . Fondly remembered . Everyone needs to know where the escape door is . Short of starving , I could n't kill myself if I wanted to . Short of anything I could n't kill him . The house , lit , does appear to be the scene of an endless party . Tonight there are a dozen and a half visitors warm inside ; the driveway is as packed as a parking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon the children ca n't wait to be alone with their mother . Partly to oblige them , partly to regain his breath , Dan goes out after lunch to do some shopping , to buy the paper whose typeface has been replaced in his memory by the agitated style of the New York Daily News . The children have insisted they can take care of Laura ; she is their new project . Hallie is planning entertainment for her , Jon refreshment . They go at their responsibility with the intensity of rookie babysitters . To start it off precisely right Jon walks his father to the door , the  | host of the house . " Do n't worry , nothing can happen , " he assures his father . " Just do n't stay away too long . " " Gotcha . " Dan rumples his hair , which is not his gesture but the kind that belongs to fathers who wink , who are called " Pop " by wide-eyed apple-cheeked children on soundstages . " Hold the fort . " " Dad ? " ( But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidentially . " Can you get us something ? " " What do you need , Jonathan ? Shaving cream ? Playboy ? " " No , I mean  --  you know , something  --  good . " " You 're talking about a payoff . Listen , pal ? " Jon is caught somewhere between fear and embarrassment . " You expect me to pay a tax every time you do something considerate for your mother ? I do n't know which 'll happen first , I 'll go broke or all your teeth 'll fall out . " " No , not for that . " Jonathan , behind the storm door , is suddenly shy . He shrugs . " Just  --  because . " " Oh , your charming smile , your honesty . You highway robber . " You earnest eager honey-flavored boy , you hybrid winner . Why not ? What the hell . " A Milky Way for you and an Almond Joy for Hallie . Will that hold you ? " Jon , who knows he and his sister deserve something they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees are in bud , lime-green : it happens all in a day . Everything will fall into place now . New York is a feeble dream , a distant memory he can easily convince himself never happened . ( The day before yesterday , no , three days ago , when Hallie was gone , he could n't remember Laura 's face . ) Anything can be beaten down with enough attention to the path of blacktop just ahead . Provided you stay awake , you do n't crack up first . And keep in shape . When your guard goes down , everything competes to be called real . Me , me , no , me . He sees the kids at school breaking their i  | arms to be called on ? 000h , 000h , Mr. Courser ! imitating real pain . But reality does n't have to be picked out of the class , there it is suddenly ... . On Main Street he makes his habitual U turn into the angled parking bays in front of Hatfield 's Books &; Stationery . There is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , anxious , flat-up like a child 's at the bakery . He rolls the window down ? " Not one but three signs up there and they all say ' No U turn ' " ? and round-bellied Benny Sheehan in his worn blue uniform stops midsentence . " Danny ! When 'd you get back ? Jesus ! " So it begins . Benny walks him in to see Jay Hatfield as he would escort an apprehended thief across the street and into the police station . He does not know how to walk any more without hovering . Jay Hatfield , with a new mustache , is stacking boxes out back but comes to him so quickly Dan thinks he must have left them hanging in midair like the Road Runner in his cartoon . He talks quietly to Jay and Benny , who are outraged that the Bickfords got to Dan and Laura before they did ? how did they do it , that 's the mystery and it 's worth a good deal of speculation . Dan feels himself waiting . He has a net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are . Well , he 's the only show in town . Imagine New York . He sees Second Avenue , his least favorite place to drive , all the Bumper Cars hightailing it downtown , rolling , free falling from left to right and back again , lane to lane , braiding traffic , the fire lane clogged ( Hallie and Jon worried a lot about the fire lane , they put a lot of energy into praying it clear and open just in case . He wondered if all children were as sensitive to the imminence of disaster . ) But even there  --  a month ago he was walking the kids on Fifty-ninth Street , they were standing in front of a vendor who had a car-trunkful of  | stolen meat , and was selling it faster than radios and leather belts , before the cops could discover him  --  holding up each great red rack of it like a newborn baby by the heels  --  and there were Natty and Janet Riggs , pretending not to see them , turned to look into the window of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dan saw their faces in the window , muffled but undeniably theirs . He smiled and hoped they saw his reflection smiling , turning away . In Hyland , the rate at which they swim up is daunting . Or it 's because he knows them all : Miralee Guyette throws her arms around him with an emotion he finds half touching , half absurd . She rests her head on his shoulder . He reassures her : " Miralee , hey , it 's okay . Nobody died , you know . " He has tried , his whole life long , to get close to that chestful she 's lugged from the seventh grade on ; she with her tiny innocent face that seems not to acknowledge herself from the neck down . Her hair is an artificial grey  --  strange . It 's impossible to get close to her across that fortress of bosom , he would n't have guessed . Chet Guyette comes in behind her ; the door swings mightily . He raises a hand as if to say " There you are ! " puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way he must his wife for comfort , large , commanding , forgiving . There is emotion in the air , a fierce charged elation . He 's back , Danny 's back  --  but the faces cave , one by one , after the easy moment of greeting . They are so glad to see him , sincerely , and so surprised , that they forget why he 's been gone . Then they remember . After a while it looks as if Jay Hatfield is giving a party . Dan stands beside the counter holding a newspaper which Jay wo n't let him pay for . ( How insulting good people 's good will can be . One needs a home-grown ingratitude to understand how it 's going to make its victims feel . ) There is an air space , eye space , in the middle of the crowd which is the place  | he stands in . He is relieved to learn he can breathe in it , at least . They ask such kind and timid questions , but thank God they are still here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they still love him . He watches the love hang from a distance , crystals of it , hard , permanent , apparently unkillable . He wonders if it has anything to do with him or only with the space he has always stood in , Danny Courser 's place . Or is that him , all there really is of him ? He did n't fare so well out of it in New York , he did n't cast a shadow . It is his gratitude : in response , before he can stop himself he has called out " Listen ! Everybody ! Laura wants me to invite you all over to the house tonight . She said if I saw anybody . . . . Come on and see she 's not so bad off as you think . " They demur . He insists . They are relieved , delighted . He tries not to think about what he 's done , he is like someone overspending at the store , running up such debts anyone with sense should stop him , ask if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bartender should have ejected . Jay is the bartender , but he is rubbing his hands together ; for a quiet man he ca n't get enough of parties , he drinks himself into total silence , smiling , shyly touching the women , nodding at their husbands as if he 's only doing his duty . " Call Sandy Mead . And Roger . Call Gordy , huh ? Is Annette around , that whole crew out there ? " Miralee promises they will bring food at least . " Dips ' n ' desserts . " " Like a wake , " Dan says , coming back down . " Silly , like a picnic . " She is laughing , backing away to get started in the kitchen . " And some cakes , cookies , petitfores . For Laura , petit-fores . " Her husband gives her a pursed look . " Miralee . " Let them check out Laura and back away some more .  | " We 'll bring the beer . And remember . Do n't fuss , Danny , we know you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us and then relax . " " Laura will be tickled , " he says and leans against the swinging door with his shoulder . ( Look Laura , no hands ! ) " Thanks , Jay , " he calls back , tipping the paper beside his head like a hat . He has left them in there to talk about him . He takes a long time shopping : the children will be upset . But he 's afraid to go home and tell Laura what he 's done . Instead he invites a few more people at the A &; P. They ca n't wait to come , ca n't wait . He stops off at his brother 's station and invites him too . John , at least his white eyes , gives him an incredulous look from beneath his chimney-sweep 's dirty face . " Did Laura really say ? " but then he stops . " Donna 's got bowling but she 'll break it , " he says and goes back under the grease rack . Hallie and Jon meet him at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candy . Standing in the center of the kitchen , imagining himself in the space again with all their friends  --  his friends  --  around ( " For Laura , petit-fores , " that bitch ) he lets it become a surprise party . She 's never had one before . Sitting still has nothing to do with resting . They are at odds . I am at odds . Trucks change gear passing the house , just at the mailbox they do it , grinding and gasping , the only thing I hear facing back towards the garden is the sound of huge animals climbing out of breath . I see my husband then running around the side of the house that muffled way I remember , sitting a little on his heels , that crouch that feels noiseless . He is holding a twoby-two in his hands in front of him , cradled , a scepter . His  | shadow runs out ahead , swings sharply as he turns and stops . The woodchuck , brown and still as a stump , is busy fattening on last year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever became of last year 's garden ? The season drowned with me and all that green . ) This one is pudgy and its back is turned . Dan moves up a foot a minute , he never ripples the grass . I do n't know about his face , from behind he all flows into the club . He raises his arms as slowly as I do . Holds and holds and I know the animal will feel him , smell him , stop , turn , run , but it does n't . It crouches like something small at prayer ; it will die gorging . Dan makes a noise like a Samurai , I can hear it through the glass , and ( I close my eyes ) bashes the bent head . ( It squeals . I open them . ) And bashes and batters it  --  his heels come right off the ground  --  until the squealing stops . The two-by-two is bloody halfway up . He kicks the carcass with his toe and then turns and is angry , his face is angry at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is walking back carefully now , picking his way through the unplanted garden , its muddy rows , putting his feet , his sneakers , down precisely as a horse 's hooves , for the sake of their whiteness . I have to recognize this man . He has killed woodchucks before . " It 's us or the woodchucks , " he says each year and I agree , their blood baptizes the peas , the carrots . He does it with a gun like game , stands behind the broadest apple tree to hide and fire , more cowardly than clubbing . But I look hard at his angry face , angry myself . He drops the square club in the barbecue pit , without looking lets it go and comes on walking . He disappears around the side of the house . One day he will never come around into my sight again . pI101 Their house has no doorbell . You do not even enter at the formal center door ; maybe you did in 1790 but now there is n't so much as a path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mudroom alongside the kitchen , which used to be the wagon shed . ( It 's one thing to own a beautiful house , another to put on airs ; they would all have to be different people to want to come in by the grand entrance , looking for a place to lean a baseball bat or put down a bottleful of insects . ) As to the doorbell , Dan has always thought ( he 's impressed by Aunt Jemmie 's purity in the matter ) doorbells are so  --  anachronistic , Laura ventures . Just out of place , he answers , whatever else . Of course he could install one , Jon could install one , but imagine General Bolt with a little canned " bing bong . " ( " Oh , imagine your General Bolt with a dishwasher , honey , a shower , a dryer , a blender . Do you think he blew up his hair like whipping cream every morning the way you do ? " But she kisses him as she says this , just at the bottom edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , she condescends to it whenever she can . ) Instead of anything electric there is a long string of golden sheepbells Laura bought in Greece one summer . They hang by a ribbon on the heavy mudroom door , a mild affront to the portion of the Hyland populace that has reason to call on the Coursers . Inside , the house is lively and foreign , as the bells warn it may be : a rug from Chile and one of those strange stringy hangings with knots in it from somewhere . Colombia ? It is all Laura , the interesting unmatched furniture , the hanging pots that look like they 've been dug up in the yard . There are no ruffles and there is little shine on the surfaces . It is not taste to be proud of , their friends think , nor to make the house proud , but they seem happy enough with it ; even Dan who grew up with scuffs and unmatched furniture of no particular period seems happy enough . He has a collec-  | tion of stolen road signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walpole jail . For an hour , from 7:30 to 8:30 , the sheepbells have been jingling , the door opening on another and another . Billy Bickford and Louise , proprietary , are leading the guided tours . After the first few arrivals Dan decides to be in any room but the one in which her friends first confront Laura . He has seen Miralee come laughing in  --  she seems to fan the air into action around herself  --  and turn before his eyes , before Laura 's , to a pillar of sugar . Dan would have preferred salt but she was not consulting him : on her own she oozed hope and delight so strenuously that Dan wanted to put her out of the house . Had Laura become Miss America ? Dougie MacDermott appears , breathless , all angel blond curls . He has tried to become a musical comedy star and has gotten as far as the Laconia Summer Theatre ( going to Broadway , his friends say , by the North Pole route ) ; has grudgingly taken on the role of Hyland 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's the difference between Dougie and Harpo Marx ? " Dan : " Dougie 's sexier ? I do n't know  --  what ? " Laura : " Dougie ca n't play the harp . " ) Dougie goes down on one knee , arms spread , in full theatrical cry . He seizes one of Laura 's hands from its limp curve on the arm of her chair and tries to kiss it . Noble try , Dan thinks , the ass . They are astounded , call out , come running : she is falling forward . She lands with her head tucked to her knees , tucked to Dougie 's lap like a woman overcome with an unseemly passion . " Is she fainting ? " cries Miralee , leaping backward as though she 's seen a mouse . " Help ! " Dougie 's cheeks turn tomato red . Dan has never seen skin color so spectacularly ; it 's awesome . ( Surely they could find a use for such a skill in the movies ? If they filmed him in black and white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries to help Laura up but he is awkward , his eyes are fevered with embarrassment . He is afraid to touch her now . " Here , " Dan says , gathering up his wife . For the first time there is some comfort in her half-familiar body . He lifts her in a kind of hug , knee to knee , and settles her back in her chair . Her shoulders are shaking . But that 's laughter , as it happens ; she is going to keep him off balance one way or the other . " You ca n't jerk me around like that , Dougie , I ca n't defend myself the way I used to ! " She tells him this cheerfully , without malice . " Of course it 's the thought that counts , right ? So thanks . Nobody 's tried to kiss my hand in a while . " Dougie goes on blushing , his cheeks look painted . " Come on now , do I have to cheer you up ? " A wan smile goes around the circle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directs , and with a massive effort of shoulder raises her whole arm off the arm of the chair . At the end of it her fingers are locked in a gentle curve . " Five poor parsnips hanging in the weather . " " What ? " Dougie continues to look as if he 's been struck a hard blow between the ears . " Oh , some poet who did n't like his hands anymore . I think they were getting old . " She would never have invoked a poet before , not in this group . Well , they can all walk ; let her have her advantage . Dougie , alarmed , grasps her hand lightly , holds it now like glass . " Listen , if nobody 's going to laugh with me , I 'm going to get very lonely . " It 's the cajoling voice she uses to jolly up the children . " I told Dan we 'd better learn to laugh because ? ! " She is also , he supposes , entitled to her bit of makebelieve , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she does not look at him .  | " Here , now , look ! " She demonstrates her ability to drink from a long straw , to move her chair an inch a minute , to write her shaky name four inches high , splayed like a daddylong-legs across the page , with the aid of her metal-rubberplastic do-hickey , which she straps on herself , slowly , slowly , using her teeth . Her cheeks are pink with a low-burning excitement . It is unlike her , the whole show is , she seems to careen , a little drunk on something , only in slow motion . Anyone who entered the room as Dan picked up the dropped paper the second time and , expressionless , replaced it on her tray would think the people in the silent circle were watching a magic show , or a high-wire act . They are skeptical and hopeful and eager to be convinced . Laura smiles straight ahead and Dan sees that she has n't been proving her triumph with this show of expertise , but her failure . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , there ai n't no more , " she declares in a small voice , smiling , sweating hard from the exertion . They argue her down , assure her that it is remarkable , this repertoire of tricks a monkey can do , and swing by its tail to boot . Her eyes are shiny as , relieved and appalled , her friends pour their admiration down on her . Oh friends , let me explain myself . I do n't know what you see . I am the same woman but for small differences . For one thing I complain constantly , it gives me something to do . My voice raises reassuring welts on my husband 's skin , otherwise he might forget me . ( I will try not to complain to you . ) For another I have no IUD or anything like it and another I never had dandruff before but they give it out in the hospital so I got some . For one more where you ca n't see I am falling for-  | ward almost always falling forward though what meets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time every day remembering how , disgusted , I watched my grandfather without his glasses groping , twitching his hands over surfaces like a blind man looking for clues , working his tongue on " Help " in case he needed it , his eye sockets mulched pale by the heavy hornrims . He would stuff the folded glasses in a beach shoe and deflate like the beachball at my feet . I 'd lead him to the water , in to his waist . He 'd flap his white arms then , wings of an oversized barnyard bird put upon by something smaller , quicker , that bit at his feet . Then he 'd raise his face to the sun because he did n't have to see it to know it was there . Whether you want to know or not , my whole blind body is nowhere that way , hanging withered in space , and now when I close my eyes it is falling forward , weightless but somehow somehow falling and if my house began to burn , General Bolt 's beloved pile of ancient tinder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling pitching down Would I have to hear them catch and burn ? There is a corner of the living room where Laura has perpetual lights that make her plants flower . Violets thrive there , coleus comes up garishly bright , the mottled green of leaves is exaggerated , unreal . Dan thinks it 's obscene , city folk 's impatience : things ought to grow when they grow , flower when they flower , die at the end of their season . But she is always dragging in weeds from the garden , in the short voluminous months when they outdo their more modest , permanent houseplant cousins ; she pulls things out of the woods and watches the collapse , the wilt , the seedtime and  | browning . Nature is not your enemy is what he has tried to teach her , but it is n't your patsy either and it will not be pushed around . But she has grown up with flower shops and out-of-season vegetables at shameful prices , why should she believe in such limits ? The argument , at this point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy ? The lights are on and he will tend the plants as he tends her . Let the flowers burgeon for their mother who loves them but who has no hands . Dougie MacDermott is standing in the dark corner far from the center of the party , with his hands splayed out in the fluorescence as if it were a faucet letting down warm water . Dan feels as if he is talking to the hands , which crumple to fists and open , crumple and open . " You look like you could break something , Doug , " he says kindly , and leans an arm on the awning that hides the lights . Doug keeps his hands open in the wash of light . They are unexpectedly wrinkled , their furrows dark with shadow . Dan thinks of two young sisters whose deaths he read about one time , whose hearts , the doctors had found , were ancient : the gnarled hearts of old women , and no one knew why . Why are your hands so old ? he wants to ask Dougie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Laura 's tears and his own . You do n't do any dirty work , you move dressers and click lamps on and off for your customers , and write out receipts on carbon sets , why do you have grandfathers ' hands ? But it 's the light , this ghastly illumination seeping like a gas . He stretches his own hands out beside Dougie 's , they stand side by side like men at adjoining urinals . " Jesus , Danny , " Doug says bitterly , and points with his chin in Laura 's direction , out in the light . " Is n't it all broken already ? What 's left to break ? "  | Dan moves closer . Dougie 's life has never particularly interested him ; he 's lived with his pretty , funny face turned elsewhere , he can tap-dance , he can juggle and recite Shakespeare in a thin voice , he reads Variety in public . He has no wife . Dan does n't even remember inviting him to the party . Where does this sudden feeling come from ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want this to feel like a funeral ? " " My grandmother had a stroke , " Doug says . " This was so long ago  --  but she was an old woman , there never seemed to be much sense pushing her very hard , you know ? I mean , for what ? She knew she did n't have long anyway . But Laura ? " " Well , Laura 's pushing . She 's had plenty of therapy and she 'll be having plenty more I guess . And a nurse , she 'll have to have somebody in with her , I 'll be back at work sometime . I 'm trying to get something to tide me over till the school year starts . " Dougie nods absently . Then he straightens his shoulders , pulls his hands out of the light and says abruptly , " Do you know I 've always been in love with her ? " Dan can feel him smiling into the dark . " Laura ? You serious ? " He feels an odd pride as if she were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time she came into the store and took one look at the trash in there and I thought she was going to be sick . And , see , I agreed with her but nobody was supposed to know that . I mean , you know , it 's an appalling bunch of . . . well , anyway , ever since then I 've had a real thing about Laura . You can tell her if you want to . " Dan stands in the half darkness , bemused by this confession . " Why should I tell her ? Would n't you be embar-rassed ? " But Dougie shuffles his feet and says , with the conviction  | of a child , " Why should you be embarrassed about loving somebody ? It is n't shameful , is it ? " He shuffles some more . " I 'll tell you , she 's always popping up in my dreams . " " I think I ought to be jealous . " How Laura would laugh . " No , nothing like that , they 're really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether too decent . Once she was teaching me how to climb a mountain , we were both wearing these ridiculous knickers and goggles , we looked like Lindbergh and  --  I do n't know , Amelia Earhart . Listen , Dan ? " Dan listens . Dougie 's real voice , animated , is much more commanding than his stage voice which sounds like it comes out of a kit ; he wishes he could tell him that . " Danny , can I come over sometime , maybe , and sort of ? just sit around and be with her , do you think ? If she wants company ? I mean , would that bother you ? " What a strange blend , he thinks , of old-time shut-in visit and new-time horny neediness . Do n't you have any kids your own size to play with ? he wants to ask Dougie . But a part of him is touched , is trying to be touched , instead of pitying . Behind that  --  his head is like a railroad flat , room upon room of feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't consult somebody 's husband , no matter what kind of time you want to make with her , innocent or not . There is no innocent time . How in the hell can he ask permission ? " Look , you do n't have to ask me , Dougie . She can have her own friends and they do n't all have to be women , I mean , Jesus , if you want to come . If you have time . . . " But look , he wants to add , no soothing the sweated brow with lavender and bringing little bed robes and custard . And likewise , no touching the goods . Dougie shakes his hand fervently . They have agreed to some kind of deal on good terms . What bizarre comfort the invalids can give each other . If he is jealous it is for the rough  | piece of his own pride Dougie has torn off in his smooth hands without even suspecting . " Holly baked them for you , " Marian Hatfield tells Laura , offering a heaped plate of cookies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through . She will tell her daughter Holly that Laura looks as if she 's under water . She moves like the doctor in that movie they saw about the new way to give birth to a baby , all gentle , all slow , and then they bathed the baby endlessly , remember , breath by breath . How she brought her cupped hand over , lowered it deliberately as a crane , fell on the cookie , grasped three or four times with thumb and forefinger until she hooked a firm edge , brought it up so carefully and , leading with the top side of her hand , by the time she got it above her mouth and down and in , she looked like she had no appetite . Her eyes were full of tears . So were mine , Marian said , but I thought , We do what we must and what we can and God only measures how much we care . " Oh God , " Holly will say , " God gets into everything . You should n't have to care that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Marian will ask , not because she is pious but because she is practical . " What difference does it make . Care is care . " What 's been lost ? He has no right to an opinion . He can feel his little toe , he can pick lint off Marian Hatfield 's shoulder , casually , a long pink thread . He can feel a fullness at the crotch at the sight of Laura 's profile , her sweet unchanged breasts that must be warm under her blouse , above the armor of her corset ; something like orphans they are , abandoned . He is entitled  | to an opinion nonetheless . What are these wives , he thinks . What are they for ? To wax the kitchen floor , then strip the wax , then wax again ? To lie on their backs ( or otherwise ) and make the lights go out ? Is she for standing on her thin crosscountry skis , smiling , with snow on her blue hat , salted across the front where her hair sticks out ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the belt pulls a little low across her backbone ? Something tough about that ; she likes to think it , once he caught her posing in the dresser mirror , thumbs in the loops , dragging on them . Buttoning the kids up and down  --  they manage that now . Sitting in the big chair reading , her feet in the speckled wool socks , legs slung over the side like a sixteen-year-old on the phone . Is it her pinescented ammonia he loves , her dustcloth ? She 's a lousy skier , he looks for excuses to go without her . Is it her piccalilli , her frozen squash ? She heckles him for the basketball he watches , but likes it , likes the heckling , sometimes they end up scrapping and fooling around and finally warming up a little in the breaks between quarters . Her father does n't know a backboard from a backgammon board . Well , she can still heckle . Her fingers on the holes of her recorder , flattening down ; she makes a double chin and cross-eyes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing . He hates that dinky sound , he calls her Little Toot . Her fingers playing him , certainly , but even that is no sum of Laura . Wife ? As wife ? The room is thick with wives . What are they ? What is she to him that she can no longer be ? Only the losses to herself . . . . Her self flies up in front of him where he ca n't catch it . Who cries when she cries , who feels nothing ? Feels the perpetual dull ache of skin against bone ? Grey . White . Black space . She 's always had a passion for saying about husbands that they see their wives only as wives ; appurtenances . Moving parts and a motor called duty .  | Not what are wives , my husband : who are these women ? These people . Now he feels this detaching : stands in the doorway running his index finger round and round the triangular churchkey hole in his beer can , winding himself up like a spring watching her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you forget it , " his mother had said one day , viciously , squeezing cold water out of a rag to put over the eye Kenton Courser had bashed . " For better , for worse , but I do n't know who was ever really sorry to lose the company they married . " He does n't really remember these words , not exactly , but he remembers his confusion about how this had happened , this blue eye socket , purpling fast , and what she meant ; remembers the grey outside the window , late fall surely , around 4:30 , 5:00 , dishwater dark . That was the worst time of day for him and his brother  --  the time they came into the low tight house and stepped on each other 's feet , breathed the same air  --  Fran doing her homework , good girl , he and John snarling in the corners .. . He goes across the sunporch to Laura , very purposefully , she sees him coming and he knows she stiffens . But he stands behind her chair , lays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her hair , smooths it . He feels her straighten her shoulders as if bracing for something . I smell it , I can spend hours only smelling it : spring coming up on summer like last year , all the last years . Sweet , ripe , what is it ? Smell old melting snow still , just the way my fingertips still feel . Lodged in the brain cells whole , all of it is . If Dan with his stiff neck , stiff back , ever touched me above my breasts where I edge towards feelings like ice thinning out , do you know I would feel it everywhere . Memory is not only unkind . Memory is a muscle too if you  | work it . It still bends and straightens though not always at command . That seems to be my secret . Will he ever go out of himself and his mourning , his loss , to guess it : I am still here . Louise , still sitting knee to knee with Laura , is suspicious of the young teacher who thinks electricity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So then he held up a lightbulb and said Tell me , does this say boy on it anywhere ? ' " She laughs meaningfully . Laura smiles . ( Every one of Dan 's students is a boy . ) " But I told Pammie if she really does n't want to make a motor I 'll go talk to him and see if he ca n't find something a little more useful for her to do . What 's she going to do knowing how to make a motor , will you tell me ? I think the truth of the matter is , a man teacher does n't know what kinds of things little girls do . " " Well , not only that , " says Marian Hatfield , dragging a frayed string of connection as far as she can and discreetly dropping it , " they care so little these days , do you know they told Jamie , not outright but in so many words , that even if he keeps up his grades , it does n't matter how high they might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new quarterback who just happens to be the son of the assistant principal , you know , that took Ed Brandt 's place when he moved over to Keene . " Dan rubs the back of Laura 's neck ; she moves her shoulders comfortably in spite of herself . This whole long year he has learned a new kind of thinking , or had it forced on him , his mind is loose and busy with random firings . Was it the busyness out there , the unpredictability of the city ? He 's seen more moving images in a year than he 'd see in a lifetime in Hyland . Now he finds himself somewhere in the middle of a  | memory of a movie he saw in New York that was a " glimpse " of a Hollywood that might or might not exist but that Louise and Marian and even he like to imagine : everyone bouncing from big pill to little pill to bed to sanitarium , and then to Forest Lawn , or whatever it 's called , before their time . Mourned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to make you feel a little safe and boring but very virtuous , contented , close to the warm center of the good earth : your death will be ordinary , shovelling snow , pushing back your chair from a Thanksgiving meal in the bosom of your family , yessir . Imagine Laura whipping him with a belt , needing to slam his flesh into wan excitement ; imagine the things he ca n't even imagine . He curls her hair around his finger . He feels hard and clean with gratitude and garden-variety lust . Clear water . Her voice , telling a story about a practical joke somebody played on a nurse and the way the nurse lost her temper , breaks his heart . He is sure that is what it feels like , a real spilling over inside his chest , the way an egg , sunnyside up , runs down when it 's pierced , warm and thick . It is only her voice  --  not what it accomplishes , not even the stories it tells ? that makes him feel like himself . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words like " bahthroom " and " hahf . " To this day he is unprepared for it , that fake classiness that 's frozen closed by the time it gets into the mouth of New Hampshire  --  it is a condition he lives in . Familiarity , love , voice music , they are conditions , like the temperature of air , the barometric pressure . He would like to wrap himself in her voice the way he wrapped himself in her robe , one time , where it hung in the closet on East Twentysecond Street , its sleeves buttoned around air , and pressed hard to absorb whatever it might still hold of her . He felt like a teenager with a crush and at the same time like a pervert  | with a secret fetish : both . Both sides of innocence , and in the middle nothing . " Laura , I think maybe we 've got to go in the other room for a couple of minutes , " he whispers . She 's been putting away as much beer as Louise , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fast as it goes in . " Where are we going ? " " You know , come on . " " No , I mean where , not why . " The old sticker . He feels as if he 's dropped her again . The chair does n't fit into the narrow downstairs bathroom . There are people in all these rooms . Either he lugs her upstairs or ? " Come , let 's go outside ! " he says and pushes her chair to the kitchen door , scoops her up ( the laborious careful scoop that puts him off balance ) and , leaning her whole weight against the storm door , unlatches it and moves down the few back steps with her towards the garden . " You want to fertilize a little patch out here ? " Now what ? Will he trip in a woodchuck hole , fall into the compost pile , pitching her forward onto the coffee grounds like a banana skin ? He sits , trusting , on the small stone wall that separates the upper from the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , and pulls her down with him . Unbalanced for a second , he rights himself ; she 's not the only one who 's off center . ( Well , she is his center of gravity . Is it any wonder ? ) She is bulky as a grainsack on his lap . " Now , m'love , if you 'll just let me get up under here . " He holds her back straight , thrusts a hand up her pants leg to throw the switch , nearly capsizes more than once but holds her , holds the damn hose , twists it open . Half a six-pack sizzles out onto the grass . He can see the bubbles standing on the grass , little fish eyes . " Are n't you high from all that ? Jesus . " " Mmm hmp . Do n't stand in it . "  | " I 'm not . " Doing all this with one hand while he supports her weight with the other is exhausting . He moves her on his lap and she sits hard on the tenderest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and centered to be eased off . " Laura . " She does n't answer . " Laura , laugh with me a little , huh ? Here we are , two adults . " " Is that what we are ? I thought we were one infant with a woman 's brain and one stalled child ? " He is holding her in his lap : Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy . What was his name , Jerry Something and Farfel , the big dolls always a little irritable , being misunderstood all the time , or misunderstanding , which was it ? Somebody always saying " No , no " but which one did the contradicting , the man or the dummy ? They seemed more alive than half his friends . His brother called him Mortimer for years , Mortimer Sherd the stoop . The feeble-minded noisy one . She seems to shift in his lap . Possibly he relaxes a little and she sways . Her face stays tense , absorbed ; whenever her body is in a new place she concentrates like a cat , learns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra . Body , body , body . The dinosaur was all body , no brain ; at least she sees herself as woman brain , infant body . " Listen , this is not the time or the place but I want to tell you  --  if we 're going to go on ? " If she turns her head she will have to speak into his forehead . She chooses to look straight ahead . " Go on how ? " " Go on . Like before . Like we 've always gone on . " " I 've never thought of us , before , as going on , we were just ? " " Oh , forget that . That is n't what I 'm talking about . I have got to have ? " He stops . It is too unreal , too grotesque , he ca n't speak . There are real people inside his house , eating  | date nut cookies , looking for napkins in the kitchen drawers , turning on the bathroom light . " You 've got to have some respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She sings that , a frail-voiced Aretha . " No , you do n't have to respect me . Only I do n't understand how we 're supposed to go on living under the same roof with you despising me every minute , day and night . Again and again  --  I mean , I know I 'm not in a position to ask you for anything , except you 've got to tell me how  --  Laura ? ? how in the hell I 'm supposed to get from minute to minute of the day with you treating me like that . This does n't have anything to do with forgiving me or approving of me but does it ever occur to you , in the middle of everything you 're going through , that maybe I 'm in some kind of pain too ? Does any of that ? " She manages , with the closest thing to no movement at all , to indicate impatience : a matter of breath . " Do we really have to straighten all this out right now , while I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is that thing firmly closed ? " He tugs at the tubing . " It 's closed . " " You know , sometimes I think the worst thing about this  --  being a crip , ' did you ever hear them call us crips , ' that was really lovely  --  is that I ca n't get up and walk out on silly conversations like this one . It is just getting to be so damned hard to say no and have anyone listen . " She is bearing down hard inside , he can tell , and he is sorry to have pushed her to it : her right knee , suddenly , goes into a spasm , bounces the way a whole child bounces when she desperately needs the bathroom . Slowly like a dancer making a grave movement she raises her arms and puts her hands on her knee and tries to press ; most of her weight does not apply . He puts one hand on hers and closes his eyes and pushes downward the way you would hold something under  | water , leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinct to rise . It is more than a flutter they have to kill , it 's a hard wild knocking , it is something other than Laura ; it is Laura . The tighter she holds herself , the more in control , the more she is liable to flow over . Her energy froths and spills , and feeds nothing . " The clonus kid , " Laura says bitterly , meekly . She is going to cry , her whole face blurs even before the tears . " Do n't , you do n't have to be embarrassed , it 's no shame . Laura ? My lovely Laura ? " " Lovely . " But for a moment she relaxes against him . The twitching subsides and she falls back from it , triumphant to be returned to immobility . " Danny , " she says against his temple in some small person 's voice . He takes a breath so deep it seems to scrape along the pickets of his ribs . Then he carries her into the house , a man flying through clear air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said to him , in her desperation , " maybe " ? The pressure of the roomful of people , making a constant noise like water . He needs to be alone with her to get on with this beginning . He lowers her into the chair as gently as he can ; it will always be awkward . He can not see her face as he wheels her back , parting small tides of friends . This is tantalizing , harder than courtship . No , your friends can not contain you . I always knew . Their intentions are so good , I am embarrassed for them , touched . They hold my corners in their hands , my most visible edges , the loose eyelashes of my experience , a circle cut out of my belly like an old Bavarian peasant-clock . Dougie  | holds three fingers between his , and tight , as though that were all of me worth keeping . The three small squarenailed fingers of my left hand . The frail bread of my body I try to break and share with these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crumbs , not very filling . They want to see me dance . What my friends know is probably a metaphor naming something I resemble . News drifts up like snow against the house . Freddie and Annette are not here ; they have had their last fight . ( They like to do it in public , they 've always instructed their friends to laugh and their friends have been obedient . ) Freddie is the size of a jockey , which makes him a bantam cock , nervous and jealous , the leader of the laughter at himself ; Annette is so perfect she is not quite real , every feature drawn with a delicate brush . No one quite takes her seriously . ( She is the girl Dan went to in her trailer  --  they were sixteen  --  and found her so frail , so narrow , she was like a child with a lurid heart . Who was corrupting whom ? ) But they 've had a soft accepting spot for each other ever since , a brother/sister conspiratorial warmth . Freddie is anxious with Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , in trouble together , had to walk the line for the Hyland police again and again , touch their noses . " Friends I trust the least , " Freddie would say . General Tom Thumb and his lady . She 's filed for divorce , Freddie is gone , no one knows where . One of the kids went out on the highway , walking east , to look for him . And Roger Mead has bought a used Mercedes . Georgia , his wife , has opened a Carvel stand ; Roger 's waiting to catch the pieces when it falls . " The zoning board gave her a hard  | time on the store . I said , do n't worry , it 's only gon na be a temporary nuisance . " Jay Hatfield 's daughter Martha , at college , is going out with a congressman 's know-it-all son . " Yeah , I keep telling Marian , he 's like Georgia 's Carvel , only a temporary nuisance too . " They are solicitous of Laura , who is in turn solicitously grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She eats them and then closes her eyes , letting them puddle in her lap . Miralee has a friend whose cousin is a nurse who works with  --  pause  --  does therapy . Marian Hatfield 's mother does too , but she 's probably too old if there 's lifting involved . There 's lifting . Louise looks like she 's guarding Laura and her chair against further harm ; she is not a grandmother yet , she has not had a chance to use this particular look of happy busy power since she had a child in a baby carriage . Paraphernalia , Dan sings to himself , par-a-pha-nail-ya . He feels mellow ; almost normal . All his instincts are not so base : the party is right , it 's what she needs . For what it 's worth . What he needs . " You know what I really wanted to be , do n't you ? " Jay is asking Dougie MacDermott . " A minister . I do n't remember why , to tell you the truth . But anyway my father kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' He said Why do n't they let the ladies do it , I never understood why they do n't do that , and we 'll do men 's business . ' " Dan listens to the laughter , men against women like voices in a dishevelled chorus , but neatly divided . Laura used to wander over to the men , she made everybody nervous . If they were telling blue jokes they stopped and looked like their mother had caught them at something . Whether she wanted to make them itch or not he never could guess . Some part of him enjoyed her daring , she was provocative the way  | these other wives would never be , these boiled potatoes , sufficient , tasteless . His friends expected him to prevent her , though ? the part he could have done without . There was n't much he was going to prevent her from doing . ( The only resemblance he 'd ever found between himself and DeWitt Shurrock was that neither of them dared ride their wives when they did n't want riding . ) When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or hung in the doorway listening , pretending to dry a dish , pretending nothing , commenting quietly but firmly , he ignored her . He only half-hoped she 'd go away but meanwhile he pretended she was n't there . " And the dreamy things they were wearing , it was like a fairy book , all laced ? " " Say the tax goes up another eight cents a thousand , all right , just say for argument ? " " They ca n't use the phone book , they do n't know how to make change of a dime , I swear to you , I 'm not exagger-ating " Marshall 's has them . Not in every size but they 're always reduced , it 's a permanent sale so what do you call it ? " If he closes his eyes , it 's Before . Then will it all have to happen again 0 Lord to bring them to this day ? He aims an empty beer can at the wicker trash basket and heads for the kitchen to get another . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patriots ' season , and the Red Sox 's coming up . But they will not let him . Jay Hatfield is not smiling and patting the women ; not drunk , that is . He is in one of his vigorous argumentative moods , not precisely in disagreement with anyone but so much more vehement than his friends that  | he sounds thoroughly , endlessly , fed up . He is wearing his incessant grey unbuttoned sweater and sits very straight with his hands on his parted knees , licking his pepper and salt mustache , which hangs over his mouth like bangs . He looks like a man hard at work . " Are they making you pay taxes on all that money , Danny ? That 's what we 're wondering . " " All that  --  you mean the money you folks raised . " Dan colors to his hairline . The HELP LAURA ! dances , bake sales , the raffle of the patchwork quilt , initials sewn in every square . The Saturday matinee of The Gnomemobile whose profits went to the HELP LAURA ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covers his face in mock horror , " I never even thanked you , all you incredible ? " " Nonsense , " Jay snaps out , businesslike . He is such an old schoolmarm , sweet and sour by turns . " You wrote us and we put your letter up on the post in the store , you do n't have to roll around on the floor to make your gratitude felt , you know . That 's an insult to the dignity . People understand , your friends are prepared to understand a lot more than ever you may imagine . " " Well , but still . " " But now , Laura , she must have been pleased , you never told us what she had to say about the way all her friends came out for her . " Dan sighs . You will always be caught , always , and no matter what your intentions someone will be hurt . The secret that charmed his growing-up was that he never knew that when it might still have hobbled him . " Jay , listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , I know you 're going to be hurt , but  --  look , I guess I never did actually tell Laura . " Good try , he thinks , but saying it is not so disarming that it keeps Jay from pain . " Oh , Danny , " his friend exclaims with-  | out reserve , and raises empty hands from the business of his knees . Jay runs his store , but his biggest sideline is being good in public . " Danny . " " I could n't , I could n't . You can  --  you said people can understand all kinds of the damnedest things . I know how much love and kindness and generosity went into all that effort , believe me , I can remember some of those times . When the Sharps got burned out , I remember what we got together for them . And the Madigans . You know me , you know how it made me feel to get all this help . But Laura  --  look , do n't blame her , I just thought she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But Danny , " Mick Tobler says ( Round Mick the Mad Plumber , wide as a barrel , his cowboy belt a single stave , who douses for water with a plastic stick and plays music on the job to draw the water through clogged pipes by " Hydronomic phono-attraction " ) , " this was n't just money like some insurance policy paying up , you know . " " Look , do n't you think I know , Jesus . How could I not know every one of you ? " " Do n't argue with him , Michael , you do n't argue some things , " Jay tells him , his judgment made and filed , secure . " Jay . " He is going to keep his temper , he will not stamp his foot like a petulant boy . " Jay , did you ever think how sometimes when you deal with some kind of problem with Marian it 's sort of more like politics than anything else ? You know ? Nobody ever says it 'll be like this but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not lying exactly but you 're telling her only so much , or you 're waiting with the whole story ? " He subsides , out of energy . " Still , Dan . " " Still nothing . You do n't know . You do n't know . And do n't ask me to explain what you 're not going to understand  | either . You saw the little signature trick  --  if you could tell it was her signature  --  and the straw , the way she gets the chair to do ten inches an hour in there , and she 's smiling and she deserves to be proud of all that , but you 've got to trust I was trying to deal with a psychological state . Here 's a woman who 's so reduced ? " He lowers his voice , as though it 's a secret . " So reduced she ca n't ? " He sees them huddle in that tense edgy elation , the same breathless attention he saw when they watched Laura do her tricks . It 's the tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It does n't make them any less decent , they are outsiders , that 's all . He 's in and they 're out . ( Jay used to tell him that about the war : you 've either been there or you have n't . " Do n't even try , if you never saw the floor of a foxhole . Did you know it looks just like a goddamn grave inside ? " ) Their wives do n't have their asses hooked to their elbows by clasps and plastic tubing like a Rube Goldberg invention . It 's true he does remember his emergency crew leading the fundraising drives after every calamity , what a fine pleasure it was : you set a goal , $2,000 , say , and then you compete with it , like a kid trying to outrun his shadow . What a simple contest , a noble game , and everybody the winner . Charity the cornerstone , the bottom rung , the layer of straw to keep the cold away ; it gives you a couple more of the easiest inches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact : little Sean Madigan , Sean a second grader with Jon , a lip reader , a showoff , a hanger from trees and gooser of girls , a pest ( like Dan at eight ) : Sean thrown in a watery ditch , his undug grave ; his sister wandering in a daze looking for help on a rainy night , and Skimmer Joe Madigan pickled as a fish , pinned in his pickup off the road on a mild curve , his neck twisted in a hangman 's fracture . So Hyland discovered the Madigans : made piles of canned  | goods and brought them over in Jay 's station wagon while Joe lay in his hospital bed ; exclaimed in horror over their shack that had been there through a hundred winters with nobody ever exclaiming before . Dan and his men had gone to insulate the walls , a gift of the town ( making a connection , not necessarily the right one , between the family 's poverty and Joe 's bad steering ) , and the day Skimmer Joe came home from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room with his wife ( Roger festooned with rolls of donated cabbage roses , a pot of glue on his arm , trying vainly to match up the unmatchable flower petals ) , Joe chased him halfway to Route 8 with a brick in his hand . He should have been grateful , they all intoned , the loyal ladies and debentured gentlemen ; even the ordinary onlookers shook their heads . Skimmer Joe was n't made for gratitude , though , nor for looking like a damn fool in the first or second place : bad enough to have broken his neck . Dan remembers being angry , wanting his pound of repentance , if not precisely gratitude . Half a dozen family men had spent their weekends out here unrolling asbestos batting for this joker , laying rat poison , closing the hole in the porch floor so the kids would n't break their damn necks falling in . He is more civilized than Skimmer Joe : they are waiting for their thankyou note , co-signed ; it 's not a lot to ask . All he can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not coy this time . " Someday she 'll thank you , Jay , you 'll get your thanks . Someday there wo n't be so much shame in it for her . " " Danny , I 'm sorry , " Jay says sharply , irritated at the sound of Dan 's irritation . He is remembering the round collection box that stood , steadily filling , on his counter . His daughter Holly handlettered HELP LAURA ! in poster paint with small blue flowers twined around it . Maybe he is sorry , though . " We  | were n't trying to put any kind of pressure on you . I was just surprised is all . Because I 'd have thought it would be good for Laura to see we care about her . That can sometimes be better than any medicine . But you know best , Dan , no doubt about that . You 're in the only position to know these things . " Still he wears his affronted look , a certain stiffness in his long body that he does n't know is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is not reduced by having to be grateful  --  Dan knows Jay would feel that way . But the problem is that it 's Laura they 're talking about , and who knows how to measure the requisite space gratitude ought to take up in her hollowed-out body ? Who dares approach her to take the measurement ? He is always underestimating Miralee . She wears that bright inviting expression that was intended , in high school , to make people want to confide in her . She was proud of the number of friends she had , but even Dan knew nobody had that many , not friends . The word was never meant to encompass a whole football team . ( " Carry a Reader 's Digest with you at all times , " Miralee 's mother had told her , " and you will never have to search far for conversation . " ) But she has had her reverses : her three or four lost babies , the Korean child , surely a gain , not a loss , but slight and withdrawn , on whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit . Oh , that plush maternal bosom that will never nurse a child , what an irony : for touching only . She 's sobering fast ; maybe that 's what the bottled grey hair is about . A sign . The flag grief left on her pillow , ordered her to fly ... . " Danny , " she says to him at the bottom of the stairs . " Let me talk to you a minute . " " Yes , dear . " But he regrets that false solicitous voice ; she is serious . " Yes . "  | " Is it going to be all right ? " She leans close to him so that she does n't have to whisper . He sighs then . " That depends on what ' it ' means . You know ? " " Yeah . Or what all right ' means , oh I guess I know plenty . But not this . I just mean  --  does n't she get too terribly depressed ? And you too ? " " You 'd better believe it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as grave as she , not make the quick dismissing answer : honor the effort , this is no high school senior . " Miralee , I would n't know where to begin with the problems . Hers , mine , ours . " " The kids ' . " " The kids ' . You name it , it pinches . Or aches . She 's very brave , though . She should n't have to be so brave . " " Well , she 's got no choice . Why do people think it 's so damn wonderful to be brave ? " Miralee says this very coolly , stiffly . Dan can sense a shadow of resentment in her , something just grudging . Did they not take her seriously , give her sufficient sympathy in her cruellest days ? The last baby tore loose and bled away after six or seven months . She was at a wedding and the baby stopped , like a clock , she said . It moved and then it did n't move any more , it only bled . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of her house for a month . She was home , Dan supposes , learning about the differences between choice and no choice : facts , not opinions . Not hopes but actualities . Two points on a line , but the line is broken . Dan takes his friends for a tour of the bearing walls . They study posts , the cabinets , the lintels . He knows more than they do about the way the house is supported , what is dispensable ,  | what is not , but he is a doctor who wants another opinion ; it is n't tonsils they 're talking about . Roger Mead , Sandy 's brother , round-faced , a weight lifter , hard as a boulder , works for a construction company that has built two houses whose roofs have collapsed under snow . ( And not much either . Ice and snow , all right . But those are the expected conditions , the starting line up here : you do n't build for 365 days of continuous sunshine ! ) Roger shakes his head as they make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still shows the marks of the adze , the honorable traces of a workman dead two centuries . " Goddamn , houses like this make me want to hide my head , " he says , again and again with slight variation . " Jesus , what they knew . " " You know it too , " Dan tells him , leaning on the post , " and a hell of a lot more . They just wo n't let you do it . These guys were n't trying to make a bundle , they were only building houses . This place got built for somebody 's son . " " Comes to the same thing . You know their axes never rusted ? " But the men agree . There are some walls that could go , a few . Doorways widened . Some rooms that will be off limits forever , immovable objects on all sides : fireplace , stairs . " They showed us these movies at the Rehabilitation Institute about how well all these graduates of theirs managed , but Christ , they all lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posh flat-out ranch houses with glass doors you could open with a fucking push button ! " Here there are nothing but stairs : the kitchen could be rearranged but what about a bathroom on this floor ? She ca n't go outside every time they have company and she has to pee . The house has become an endless maze , every turned corner leads to a wall . " All right , do n't blush about the toilet , " Jay says , " these are facts . Everybody needs a bowl to piss in , Liz Taylor , Raquel  | Welch , everybody . You think they do it in thin air ? Their hairdresser takes care of it ? " Dan blushes anyway , if only because he brings out the father in Jay . But what a subject for friendly masculine discussion . ( He is fastidious ; half his best qualities , says Laura , are undiscussable . ) " Hopeless , you think ? " " Dan  --  lookit . How do I say this . " Jay is the spokesman . He stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chain . When he speaks his nose lengthens . " The question is how much can Laura do ? That 's all . Even if you rearrange the kitchen , you build a lot of new cabinets , all right  --  can she use them , will she want to ? You 've got to be sure you 've got a woman here who wants to do dishes , okay ? And chop onions . I mean  --  do you know these things before you start hammering and sawing away ? Have you asked her ? I 'm sorry but I have to say this . Do you know what you 're doing or are you just hot to get your hands on some wood so you can feel like you 're doing something . Because we all know you can do that . " Dan stands looking away , listening . His jaw is tight , his teeth are locked on anger and humiliation , he is doing the hornpipe again , kicking his heels , gunning the motor , tearing Laura to scraps , feeding her backbone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine years old . The others jump in , glad they did n't have to say it first . Mick the plumber says authoritatively , bringing up the rear , " You find out every Christmas there 's some gifts nobody needs . " " What the fuck do you know about it , " Dan whispers and then touches Mick 's shoulder in shame , knowing the anger was meant for Jay whose eyes would not have widened , then narrowed , as Mick 's do , to take in the pain .  | Laura whispers , " Dan , I 'm very tired all of a sudden . " He has to ask them to leave . They apologize for staying too long . " No , I 'm glad you stayed , it meant you  --  maybe you had a good time . Only she 's got special needs , that 's all , she gets tired like a little kid all of a sudden . " It 's all right , it 's all right , do n't all fall down . He wheels her as close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't wave except with an awkwardness she will spare them , but she smiles a great deal , and nods . Things become formal , they all become anonymous : Visitors Departing . Paintings have been made of the scene : lamplight inside , snow out , a sleigh pulled up and waiting . One horse paw : , the ground . Cheeks are dutifully pecked , a few emotional hugs of the sort people execute at funerals : Here , they say , let me press some strength into you ; I know it 's futile , it 's comfort , not a cure , it changes nothing . But let me do something before I escape . Laura 's knee begins to bounce again . They stop and regard it . No one says a word . Laura looks at it as if it were a fish flopping in the bottom of a rowboat ; she thinks it 's as nasty as the next one . She gives Dan a desperate look . " Watch this , Magic Dan goes into action ! " he cries out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubs his hands together and pushes down , feet aligned , both hands tight . If she could pound that knee to bits , punish it , disconnect it . Betrayer . His face red he bears down with all his weight and it fights back . He feels as if he 's suffocating it under the pillow of his hands ; an extra shake to make sure it 's dead . " When I get tense , " she says in a sweet false voice to her astonished friends . " See  --  I 'm so glad you came that I guess I get upset that you 're all leaving . "  | The rest of their lives , the rest of Dan and Laura 's , seem to loom at the door . This is the sickroom after all . His brother looks as if he 's swallowed something rancid . Go , go , Dan thinks . Dismissed , good people , thank you . We are alone here one way or the other . Good night , good night , Dan says , God bless . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stands stricken , his face in his hands in spite of himself . He hates her , hates her , he wants one of them to die . Escape is not enough , is not possible , he would have to leave her behind watching him go . " If you ever divorce me , " she used to say , " please take me with you . " The logic was perfect for its moment . They will make a pact , stop breathing one after the other , scribble a note : Dear People , good people . It is not enough . You are not enough . What do you think we want , why do we want it ? Before is all that 's left and there is no more of it . He wheels her to the center of the room and with a small hard breath of desperation , as if he 's boosted her up to safety on a high rock , he leaves her there . She ca n't get out of the kitchen to look for him , the cabinets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He very nearly runs . For six months after Jon was born she could get no more than an hour away , an hour back : no one else could feed him . Dan remembers trying , the baby rejecting him fiercely , spitting the bottle back with amazing vehemence . He waited for her breast , shrieking till he was blue . He took it back into himself when she finally brought it ; one of his limbs that had tried to get away . Jonathan Michael the hairless tyrant , the more he needed her the greater his power . Tethered , she 'd say , the year I learned to walk bent at the waist for speed . But she would smile when she said it .  | He turns on the television set and resolutely watches I Love Lucy , which he has always despised for trying so hard to make him laugh and failing . The show is as old as television . Its tape is full of static , a snowy haze lies over the clown faces , softening them to something less seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many befores , and Desi who is no longer her husband . This actress sidekick dead and that funny man a wizened beast now , well pensioned in some Beverly Hills nursing home . Lucy knocks down a whole bookcase searching for a dime for the parking meter ( who would trust her with a car ? ) . She raises her head from the rubble with that familiar round-eyed stare , somewhere between blank terror and blank stupidity , Henny Penny 's face under a dandelion mane . The audience laughs on its tape , in its box , echo of real laughter on another day , brought on by something funnier . Brainsleep . He warms his hand between his legs . He comes back from nowhere , rested . The test pattern holds , flatter than flat , humming to madden a dog . Muscles that flex need release ; he has been clenched for hours . Hate does n't enter in , strain is the toxin . Why ca n't he remember ? Laura is asleep , one arm over her chair , chest open as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away he can hardly see her . She has left her body on the shore of the long evening , cast it off like resistant clothing and is swimming free . Float-  | ing . She must be as buoyant in sleep as she once was walking , dancing , in her obedient bones . He wonders what she dreams . Instead of terrors  --  all the things that could happen have already happened  --  maybe she dreams she 's dancing . Tumbling . Diving . Tying French knots , three times around the needle . Plucking the tangles out of Hallie 's hair . Dreaming backward , the way dogs dream when you see them kick in their sleep . What a curse , to float into the backwaters where you can never go again . Like dreaming of someone you loved so much who 's dead  --  reaching , trying to touch . His mother slowly dissolving under the hill . All you have is the lifeless body , and the body is your own . He aches for her , her losses , a dark slow red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ca n't put his hand over it , any more than she can put her hand on anything . There is the slightest burnt-sweet smell around her , a nimbus . Old friend catheter , her chaperone , her limb , her root . If he were Laura he would never go to sleep . Two o'clock he turns me away from the moon Move it for me Danny if you love me Ca n't I take anything with me onto the dark side ? Get this straight , kid ( like a man with a wet cigar he would say it ) The moon keeps moving Any way you face you 're going to lose it Jon is getting pubic hair now What do you think of that ? He turns her over , this time facing away from him . So familiar that precise length of spine . Whatever its incapacities , its failures now , they are secret and subtle and it is dark . He  | arranges her pillows at the chafing points , but when it is time to replace the one at her back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and places his hands gently not hungrily over her breasts . He waits for her stiffening but she is pretending sleep . She is wearing a flannel nightgown which took him ten minutes to struggle her into because she is always cold , mortally cold , she says it almost with satisfaction . Some quads ' thermostats get stuck on one side of normal , some on the other . If she were always too hot , what would she do ? Sit on an ice cube ? " How in the hell could we really live in New Hampshire ? Oh , winter 's going to be a real circus . " He thinks again of the films they showed at the Institute about Adjustment in Albuquerque , Phoenix , Tucson , where maybe the sand shifts but the wind does n't blow . The worst thing , that widens the rift , is that there are so many things he can not tell her ; or thinks he ca n't . Ca n't tell her , Lor , I feel like a kid at the movies , the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder , sort of sneaking , a little at a time , and we 'd both pretend nothing was happening . Victory as a vise grip ; arm as C-clamp . So ( can he say it ? ) we 're back to about fourteen . He tightens his hands on her warm breasts ( one of his arms , the under one , will surely fall asleep ) but they will never rouse themselves for him . Missed by an inch or two , the fatal line , the snow line . ( Cold from the feet up , Dan , she told him . The hemlock seeps that high and no higher . But no lower either . ) " One of these days , " he does half-whisper , undecided between threat and seductiveness , " I 'm going to turn you over , Laura , and show you how much of you is left . " There is a pause in which Dan hears the charged silence of a blank spool on a tape recorder ratcheting round and round : the sound of empty air on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins . " Listen , you can do  | whatever you want to with me , we both know that . There 's nothing I can do about it . " Her steadily bled voice . It is white . " That 's not what I mean , my dearly beloved wife . " He drops his hands , his body softens . His knee is tight against her air mattress , which yields like flesh . " You 're talking about legal rape . That 's not what I 'm talking about . " If this woman was a miracle the first time she came to him , yielding , the next time will need another name . Salvation , maybe . Absolution . He holds on , though , he is going to be her pillow , like it or not . He curves to her from behind , a question mark . She ca n't feel him there against her , except for his breathing in her hair , his shoulders bent towards hers ; she feels , he supposes , what the table would feel if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So they say . No one will make him believe it , though , unless there 's no difference between living and dead ; nothing alive is that simple . She turns her chair from time to time when she sits downstairs because the changes of direction , the movement , are good for her . If she sits perfectly still for too long her energy sparks over , it seizes her and shakes this hand or that leg . Matters of nerve endings and blood pressure , chemistries too complicated for him to know , but he trusts them and their sovereignty . He will lie against her , warm no matter what , and someday she will melt . I only want to be warm , 1 said . ( Bring this lady a tea cozy , slip it over her head the way you do her blouses and let her ears stick out . ) If we needed ecstasy to live , would n't the streets be clogged with corpses as if the plague had come ?  | Meanwhile his dreams embarrass him . In this dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is ashamed , sneaking , hoping not to be seen . His X-rated movie : he has brought a huge crowd into the bed with them , familiar and unfamiliar faces , but mostly limbs and naked anonymous parts , superb , athletic . There is a cat sitting on Laura 's face when he turns to her , the cat is opening and closing her paws , the way theirs did when she nursed her litter , an ecstasy of feeling , almost a moaning without sound , paws opening , closing , opening , closing , the nails lengthening for an instant as the skin draws back . They are in the middle of a river , on a stony spit of land , making signs to the shore . He and the cat are there , lying together on stones ; where is Laura ? Grass grows between the stones . He stands entirely naked , smooth as a small marble statue , a miniature with the modest genitals of a young boy . He bends and picks up the cat , which leans against his chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the hairs are grass . The cat begins to pull them out in clumps like sod , with a great effort , arching its back , sinking its claws in his skin for purchase . His feet are in the river ; naked he worries about his cuffs . As the hairs pull loose , his chest glowing a marble white , he feels , surprised , the long familiar rising begin , from the scrotum up , irreversibly . Which one of them is melting ? But the feeling is on the opposite shore , he ca n't reach it . He is in the middle still , wet to the ankles , and the tidal swell is somewhere else , coming towards him . Asleep , drowning , he ca n't pull back from her in time , and when he wakes with a gasp he is too late . No joke , Dan thinks , lying in the mess he 's made , the back of Laura 's gown sticky , Laura making angry noises , no joke , I 'm fourteen . A year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it in your sleep anymore . And what does that make Laura , his dirty dream ? His pinup , impossible , looming , used ? No matter what it makes her , he is her husband ( he thinks this amid a dozen conflicting angers that tug at him like currents ) and he 'll be damned if he 'll apologize . Someone was chasing me through my sleep with a butterfly net . The rim of the net was falling , the shadow coming down cool , but I turned without warning and flew out from under it . Rising against the depthless blue I clapped my hands and they rang blue and purple , shimmering like moire , like cymbals . I shuddered in flight and looked down into the iridescence . Some kind of good news in that flight , but I had to wake up . Oh so many ways to be helpless in your body , Danny , so many ways . Look . Both of us are subject to fits and spasms . Just like that . Irresponsible riot , trunk and limb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you or without you . " Range of motion . " In the morning she lies back on the bed ( he has placed a towel over his gluey adolescent stain the way the children used to when they wet their beds : dry till morning , then , only the stubble of terrycloth for punishment ) . He is showered , extra clean , in his chinos and a T-shirt . His body is supple , contained , lightly muscled ; he is not as small as the marble boy in his dream . Although he might go  | about his business half-dressed any morning of his life , there is something just possibly self-conscious about Dan 's bare arms and flat solar plexus this morning . He feels himself to be in costume , or almost so . Flaunting , or merely free of constraint . He is not trying to be cruel , only he has to know that he is strong , surely not needy . Could this vigorous young man , taking long strides from here to there ( he asks this vaguely , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife 's turned back ? Would any circumstances forgive him if he were ? This morning it seems damned unlikely ; so says his firm walk from bathroom to bedroom and back again . She is cold again , so cold , she has demanded that he put two thermal shirts on her . " You 'll sweat , " he says , " exercising . It 's warm in here . " " Good , " she says . " I 'd like to be too hot for a change . " He lifts her leg . " Farther , " she instructs him . " How do you know ? You ca n't feel if I 'm doing damage . " " No , but you 've got to push as hard as you can . You 're supposed to be stretching muscles that want to contract . So you 've got to find the last point I can go to and then push against it . " " Okay . " He holds her at the ankle , gingerly . The hair on her legs is soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too far . " " Okay , I 'm trying . Jesus . I wish ? " He pushes , feels the spring of resistance before her leg is straight up . Like thwanging a guitar string , a vibration , a tremor of distress . " You wish ? " He shakes his head , runs for cover : he wishes he 'd had time to learn more about this at the Institute . She said she did n't want them to live like thieves ; every time he sup-  | presses a thought , a word he ca n't say , he steals from them and puts back nothing . He pushes vigorously now , invited ; perhaps too hard . " How will I know if I rip something ? " She smiles her new smile of self-loathing , self-satisfaction . ( Was it always a possible smile for her , under the surface of her sensible kindliness ? A superior smile ? Was it , he asks himself but he ca n't answer . ) " I guess you wo n't . " " Terrific . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does it matter if you rip something ? " " Well ? " He lays her heel carefully on the sheet and takes her hand , coloring from the neck up , trying to be matter-of-fact as though he had n't said that , or meant what he said . The catheter runs out to the edge of the bed , the bag dangles over the back of Aunt Jemmie 's antique parlor chair , a vivid yellow against faded brocade flowers . He and John used to bend each other 's fingers back like this till they got a satisfying shout of outrage . He tugs . What would make her shout ? He does n't want to be here when her fingers turn to claws . He uncurls them and pushes , trying to impress them , to make a difference . When he pushes her fingers back to the shouting point , they go white at the joints , thank God , like anyone 's . Hallie is playing jacks on the kitchen floor . All she learned about being alone in New York she has brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rink with the odd friendly woman was as much a night alone as any other ( or so she has reported , mildly , in her own good time ) : she had a meal , she had a bath but made the woman stay in the living room , she tried on some other girl 's clothes  --  they were too small , except for the shoes which she could not keep . She used a sweatshirt for a robe and wore it home ; even over her blouse  | it felt good inside , soft and worn as fur . There was n't much talk , only a lot of looking ; the woman smoked and stared and once in a while she stroked Hallie 's hair . All this fed her nothing , only made her miss her mother . She told herself that when she opened the door to the apartment her mother would be there . The woman said she could make it happen if she believed it hard enough . She has made something happen , something like it ( though she was probably dreaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ought to feel good about it , Dan says : They are here , first thing , for her . Now she seems a nearly sufficient companion to herself , calmly going about her games , playing both sides . " How about calling up Cara when she comes home from school , or Wendy or somebody ? " Laura asks her at lunch . Hallie has finished and has turned back to her ball and jacks . Laura holds a large slice of apple firmly like a child who 's just learned how , the whole fist committed , and watches Hallie at her feet , a woman in a rocking chair regarding her crawling baby . " Not yet , " her daughter says , " I just like being here with you . " If she were n't smiling that particular smile  --  a good deal of sweet indulgence and a tiny fear of being caught at it , her eyes , as in bad books , bad movies , very nearly shifty  --  Laura would not pick up her intention , she would be pleased at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , awkward dissimulator ( silence and absence are all she practiced on her father , she got no experience at lying ) , and Laura puts her apple down and sighs . Her daughter looks up , sees she has been caught , smiles again , this time apologetically : this time a saddened smile , no teeth . She throws the ball up again and it gets away under the refrigerator , to which she can turn her face .  | I used to rollerskate with Hallie , strap the wheels to my shoes with the metal wings that only the key could move . We 'd hotfoot it downtown over the cracks in the sidewalk bumping , regular , like a train , thwack and the whish of open space and tha-wack again over the cuts in the concrete . Hills on two feet , bent at the knees like crosscountry skiers . Bent at the waist uphill against the incline . Once I was a Pied Piper with half a dozen hooting kids behind . Dan hid his head when we went out , imagine , concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't any reputation to undo , I told him and you  --  little thug of the Hampshire County District Court , vandal graduate , o cop 's hot dinner gone watery and cold  --  you are so good I do n't know who you are . Where is my pushy boy ? Step on a crack break your mother 's back Hallie would sing . I hear the echo now . She cornered well , stopped on a dime , turning in a tight circle , her calves snapping stiff . Was somebody listening who heard the dare ? Did Dan step hard on the crack to keep me home ? There are a few transactions Dan misses by virtue of absence , weariness , inattention , even indifference . This one appears to be lost to the sports page , which is open on the table beside his plate , but in fact he is thinking about the baseball season , the relief it will be to run , to sweat , to get out on the field where the only horizon is the fence , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny at the time , only later , over beer , those basketball scores : seven innings , 26 runs ! ) . He hopes it 's not too late to sign  | on with the Hatfield team , they usually get set in late winter . It comes as a shock , sickening and reassuring both , to realize they could never deny him his place on the team now . If he showed on the Fourth of July they 'd shake up the lineup to fit him in ; if he made an error an inning they 'd forgive him . Compensation for being pathetic , like a free pass to the poorest kid in town . They wo n't even have to discuss it among themselves  --  outrage is rising in him , adrenalin courses around his body these days at random , looking for a fight . His uniform will glow under the lights with the phosphorescence of specialness , of exemption . Probably they 'll resent him too , this stranger they 've silently agreed to coddle . Like a stain of darkness and not light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children will have it too , and cruelty at the bloody edges . The girl from the newspaper is such easy prey . She is the niece of the editor , which makes her combative , tense , unduly independent . Or perhaps she has grown up on Brenda Starr and , latterly , Ralph Nader . Either way , she comes uninvited to do her interview with the Coursers as if there were some muck to be raked . " This is not just going to be the usual pap you see in the old village paper , " she assures Dan , coming in at the door fast , a quarter of a step behind him . " Sometimes you can barely walk around the office for all the goo in the aisles . " She is on his heels . When he turns to look at her for that remark they nearly collide . Her eyes widen with possibility when she sees Laura . Laura in turn looks her over slowly from head to toe ( dungarees and a mussed pinkish Indian shirt , high wedged sandals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of im-  | pulses ) . The girl ; , who will not smile , clearly does not like to be studied . She is here to do the studying . " How did this happen ? " she demands , more brusque than a doctor new to the case . Laura laughs at that . " Well , now , I do n't think I caught your name . Or which of the papers you 're from ? " ( Whoever has come has scooped their competitor ; that 's laughable enough . ) There is the exasperated sigh of a dedicated worker slowed down by someone 's rank inefficiency . " Phoebe Landgraf , " she concedes . " For the Bulletin . Now ? " " Why do n't you sit down , Phoebe Landgraf , " Dan suggests , smiling behind his eyes to Laura who almost invisibly smiles back . " Thank you . " Not grateful , she sits in the wicker chair , very still . It is a creaky chair that likes to relax and give its opinion of the sitter in little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Landgraf . " New on the paper , " Dan says neutrally . " Yes , rather new . Now Mrs. Courser , you were going to tell me how this happened . " " Was I ? All right . Very simple . An accident , a boating accident . I got caught in the motor and it broke my neck . " " Among other things , " Dan offers . This is the first time any of this has seemed remotely laughable , a weapon , a shaggy dog story , a toy mouse , anything but what it is . " Among other things , " Laura agrees . " Too many to mention . " " How ghoulish . " The girl wrinkles her nose in fastidious distaste . " Well  --  ghoulish . I 've heard it called a lot of things but never precisely that . You never , uh , tend to look at yourself in terms quite like that , do you think ? "  | Phoebe Landgraf sits still , pondering . " I only meant the event , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling . " I wish I could make such a nice distinction between myself and the event . " " Mrs. Courser , will you ever walk again ? To be perfectly honest ? " Laura looks at her as though from a great height , squinting . " The essence of hard-nosed journalism appears to be short sentences , " she says coolly . " In one short sentence then , no , I will not . " " Well , what makes you so sure of that ? " Dan is fighting very hard to overcome his desire to show this young woman to the door . He has a better idea . " Stand up , " he says to her , " and put your damn notebook down . " Obediently she does so and stands , a little anxiously , before him . He takes her right forearm then ; reaches around to the back of her and , leaning hard ( resolute , angry , and shocked at the closeness of her thin body in its cotton shirt ; she is one of those concave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only as rich , as if the rich had enough without needing bodies ) , he turns her arm in a wrestling hold that he remembers from the high school lightweight team . It does n't hurt to have your arm pinned that way but you ca n't move your hand at all . The poison dart , they used to call it : soundless , odorless , painless , deadly . He rarely found the right place on a moving target . " Okay , now move your fingers . " She takes in a sharp bewildered breath . " I ca n't . " " Sure ? " She twists away awkwardly , and uncrumples her blouse . Her cheeks are red and she is staring at him . " Yes , sure . " " Okay then . There are some things you know , that 's all . " He sits down again innocently . Arrogant little bitch . But the feeling of her drawn-back body , tensing at his  | sudden attack , his warmed him dangerously . Laura is studying her blue polyester knees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of  --  I 'm really very curious  --  have you always been sure it was worth going on in this state ? " Laura opens her mouth and closes it again . She leans back and stretches , her best movement , casual-looking . It is the energy of her anger that makes her move . Dan can feel it sparking , blocked . Her arms rise as if she has surrendered . " To be perfectly honest again . " Dan the Defender . " That 's a hell of a question , do you know that ? " " No , look , I 'm not trying to be offensive or prying or anything . But the alternative to this kind of question is Toni Sargent comes up here , right ? ? the Comings and Goings in Town lady with her glasses pinned to her good old pink sweater , and she writes Mrs. Daniel Courser is home with us from the hospital again up on the Mill Road , looking rested and rarin ' to go . She thanks all the residents of Hyland for their bouquets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is sitting up straight , flushed angrily , happy in defense of her defects . " Yeah , as a matter of fact , " Dan says , " you make Toni 's column sound better than it ever sounded , if you want to know the truth . Listen , it 's a good thing to try to write a real article , you know , with real pain in it and real problems . But you 've got to get yourself a little finesse , I think you call it . You do n't just climb up into somebody 's bed of pain and start rolling around in it just like that . Jesus , you come in , we do n't even know your name , you start asking my wife if she ever thought about killing herself ? " " Would you like me to leave , " she asks , says , standing wearily . Her eyes are full . God , Dan thinks , they collapse like dandelions , even the toughies . He wonders if her pride can  | bend enough to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ? " She looks at Dan , confused . " Cripples , " Laura offers . " Or did you mean people ? " " And I did n't know you were going to be so defensive . " " Look , sit down , " Laura says bleakly . In spite of her sharpness she does not like to dislike anyone ; Dan has always thought  --  since she can entertain opposing thoughts at once ? that she 's the most generous critic he knows . " Let 's give you a little education in ghoulishness . " Uncertainly , Phoebe Landgraf sits . She has the grace not to pick up her spiral notebook and her pen . " You want to know what it 's like I 'll tell you . A little monologue . After an accident like this , first all you want is light . And breath , nothing else . And then noises all around to make you believe you 're still alive because you doubt it , but that comes later , when you 're already coming out of yourself a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds like a woman on stage , alone in a spotlight ; it is a pity she is embarrassed by the dramatic . " Okay ? You with me ? " She asks this softly ; the girl nods , perhaps forgiven . " Then the noises begin to make you crazy with nervousness . And you want the parts that still hurt to stop hurting , your head , your neck , your shoulders , but they 're all full of stitches so they smart and itch and then all they do is ache endlessly . Endlessly . A hundred degrees of pain , if you concentrate on it , it gets completely unreal  --  you just blank out on it as pain , it becomes something else , some  --  I do n't know , some uninvented new thing . I do n't know what . Nothing I would recognize from my other life . " She can scratch her nose ; she hits it with the side of her hand . " But you see , when that stops you want to know what about all the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flushed down the toilet . " She is almost merry with the animation of this guided tour . " When  | you 're alone you try to move , just a half an inch , maybe . You try to trick yourself into moving . Every twitch feels like it 's the beginning of something . It takes incredible concentration and energy , you want to go into a complete collapse every time you work on a finger . And meanwhile every ten minutes somebody 's in there poking or prodding or stretching ; they do n't even want you to sleep because your lungs fill up as soon as you stop concentrating on them , so you 're up all night and all day and you never know which is which  --  and then ? " Laura is watching Phoebe Landgraf listen . Can I expect to tell her how for months I thought I was asleep ? In every direction warm stone . Mountain and green growth of blanket . A hundred years , I thought , and I would stir , and the maids in the scullery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blink and wake . The doctor was the prince and he would kiss me up and out . But I almost died . They made such noise saving me . And they began to say You have to stay awake . Only a minute 's sleep . I remembered the lovely doze between contractions then but look what came of that , Hallie and Jon  --  sleep for strength , not each time a little nip of dying . The body , mine but not mine , breathed slowly , heavily , in its tunnel between sheet and sheet . Pores opened and would not close , closed and would not open . Someone tinkered all the time and after a long bleeding the surface looked whole . Anyone can see it went on being , it was only incapable . Warm tears , familiar blood . Blood felt the same finding its easiest course down everywhere , the new notches cut , a whole streetmap flayed from my face . Fontanel drip-  | ping the freshest tears . The nurse would come . " Tears ? Why tears ? My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be firm , not pitying . Firmness is support is improvement is unmaiming . The book says . Though in my case I think they closed the book early on . " Take out the death supports . Let her live . " I think that 's what they said . I never told the nurse my plan , my fear , my secret resolution : to lift this anchor , some particle of it , one day . A finger would do , just to begin . Today , I thought one ordinary morning , right now , after the breakfast tray had gone back on its little sneakered feet , and the nurse that came with it to tell me to open wide the way I told my babies . She would laugh , though she had orders to encourage ; she knew I had only that withered root she shook out every few hours , turning the soil , turning the whole bed over and over . It was not in the book that I would move the blasted root through which my life ran out the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white muslin ground . Words cost me too much , some unkind parts of words ran for a long time just beyond me . Mercury rolling always away . I never talked to Dan , I had nothing to tell him anyway so far on the other side of every real thing . " Please . " Just that exhausted me , the shadow across my tongue . My head , which moved , fell back damp , sweat cooling . Sweat in the alleyways where those tears rolled . She bent over me , warmth and blue shadow across me , eclipsing the fluorescence that made static in my head , and leaned , pulled down the sheet , and I watched  --  someone else , someone in Kalamazoo , no friend of mine  --  I watched me moved like a tree limb I once saw in a steam shovel 's mouth . Carefully raised in the clenched pickets , carefully lowered , branches up saying a dumb stiff goodbye to the  | head I came from . Bleeding sap without pain . She replaced one arm , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming down on me . Top of my ribs felt it from underneath , here but not here , precise . She left , packed up her stewardess smile with her blood pressure tubing and left my line of vision , which was fixed . Ready . I did n't know which finger . They had my wedding ring . I had no husband I ever wanted anymore but I thought , that finger of mine has no more distinction , it could be any one . Which was the quickest to move once in its life ? Thumb , fat housewife finger , cinched at the waist , built like my grandmother ? She did things . Would she flick her head just once for me ? Or quick wit , accusing finger , the sharp one who makes up for its shortness with precision ? Did . I put off a decision . Dozed , their breakfast fist in my stomach . This was November . I woke like a child about to make a journey , excited , afraid , Index finger was the quickest once , acute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not watch it . Turned . Lovely quiet swivel of my head , like pouring water from cup to cup . Arm lay hand palm down on the blanket looking emptied , innocent . Not as it is , stubborn . I thought the blood must have rotted black in the veins by then , I tried to think the rhythm , systole diastole thrust and withhold thrust and withhold . The only scars , they said , were going to be at the shoulder , a small straight line  --  quite handsome , healing a stern white like furious lips  --  behind the elbow , below the useless left nipple , just missing the heart . Like a mummy , whole outside and empty in : a taunt . Green blanket rising like water all around . If a fly landed on my knuckle he could eat it like a lollipop . But I  | told myself , I tried to call across the downed lines of my arm , Get ready . On your mark , the order 's coming . Remember the way a dance of fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the tension , the spring of gravity coiled down , always from this position it took a thrust . But the blunt point would feel the air lighten . Sorting the orders . finger on that side , that , the inner side , pull from under , tight underneath , the nail raised towards light . That much farther from the pull of this earthweight . I kissed myself goodbye , bon voyage , you shall fly ... . Flint-spark , command , panic . Tighten . Finger , if you live . Everything in me curled head to chest inside , eyes averted . Just up for a second , wag that blunt head , then have a good sleep . But there was space all around , the whole world of air began at the tips of the finger 's tip and continued up and all around . The empty space of the room , sixth floor , fourteenth floor , the empty sky outside the dusty window and down to the street , up over the fogged city , up and up , galaxies , infinities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on me . I gathered myself for a shout and pushed the current of all that wishing through my arm again , a second time . And no . I was too angry for pity . But no . So they were right , doctors not princes with their electric probes not kisses ; their cattle prods , their needles . They knew and made no secret of the vacuum inside me . I hid in the dim green blanket they call apple green . ( 1 will not blame it for sounding , in the mouth of the nurse , like hope : " The walls are butter yellow , we call them , and the blankets apple green and periwinkle . To give a little boost . " ) There was a kind of twanging I could n't hear , could n't see , almost could not feel but it rushed back : echo , afterimage  | of the impulse . Something rode back up the arm to the shoulder , fading like a twitch . The twitch that used to answer the doctor 's knock on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you come and talk sweetly about the Will . Or think it in your silence . I have none of those capital letters of yours in me , do n't you know that ? Only vagrant twitches widening , rippling in the wrong direction , electricity evaporating like water , mazes and tangled wires , small sparks misfiring , all of it covered perfectly , oppressed , by this weight of heavy skin . If I could scrape this putty off my bones would be so light ! Skin or no skin , though : I can not touch with myself . Talk about Will and Real Desire and Hope , suspect what you must about why ( what secrets why ) some people lie escaped in their apple green buntings while they are probed , lifted and dropped , and I say Young lady . This is no subtle refusal : not the sex of a sad man that will not , will not lift up to be , afraid to be seized and used . I tried to move it , one two-ounce finger , my old friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need the finger for my life . That and a few more things . I need . I will have to learn to do without , I told myself , simple as that . I was already learning .. Grow hands , grow legs inside . But which do you think I miss the more ? The lovely swing of my skin and wishbones up and around ( in spite of will ) or the safety  --  the old and sweet ? of thinking what wishes can do , wishes and princes . What honest wanting sees to . We know , my husband , my children and I , at last , and are relieved , after our fashion : not a goddamn thing .  | " I do n't want to go through this , " Laura says finally , blinking her way back as if the light had brightened . " I really do n't want to . It 's much too intimate to talk about , it does n't sound real enough when I tell it . It was a month before I could say everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocked around . And six months before I could get the sleep out of my eye , okay ? And then people come along .. . see , everybody comes along after that , right , because you ca n't choose to go to them , so they keep happening to you . Accidents keep happening , idiots you have to talk to who wo n't go away . " She could look hard at the reporter now if she were vindictive ; if she were sensitive enough the girl would feel chastened even without the look . " I had a nurse once who said to me , ' Boy , I 'm glad I 'm not you . ' " Phoebe Landgraf blinks expectantly . " So you know what I said to her , do n't you ? I said , If there 's anybody I 'm glad I 'm not it 's you . ' " The reporter smiles a wan smile of polite disagreement . " But what 's really wrong with being honest ? What will hypocrisy get you ? Or sentimentality ? I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry to say it but you have to know they are . If I were in your place ? " " But you 're not , " Dan snorts , impatient . " Lucky you . " " Have you always defended your wife or did that come with the accident ? " He is going to give this child one more question ; then he 's going to grab her by the elbow and heave . " Mrs. Courser , may I ask you , were you doing anything before your accident ? " " You mean working ? Anything ' would mean working ? No . Just a housewife . Smelling the flowers , killing flies  --  your ordinary sort of contemptible housewife . " " So this change is n't actually keeping you from ? "  | " Well , I have n't killed any flies for a while . I get lots of flowers to smell if I can get somebody to hold them up for me . And I can still yell at my kids . I can scratch my nose now , you saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Miss Landgraf says , " I am sensitive enough to know where I 'm not being tolerated , even if you do n't give me that much credit . Thank you for your time . " Stiffly she gathers her things and gets ready for flight . Her ankles shake on her high sandals . When she is halfway out the door , cheeks pink again in her flounce of embarrassment , Laura calls out , " Miss Landgraf , I 'll give you one hard thing , one quote , for yourself , not for your paper . If there 's anything you can do with it . I do n't like to be pompous and I do n't for a second believe that what happened to me makes me wise or anything like that . But listen , there 's one thing you 've got to learn about your life , everybody 's got to learn , my husband had to learn and my kids , and I have a feeling you do n't know it . Maybe you 're too young , maybe it 's just not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh I love things that begin that way . " Miss Landgraf makes that same fastidious face standing in the doorway holding her notebook before her for protection . She looks the way Hallie will one of these days when her passivity turns on them . " My great pronouncement . " Laura is embarrassed at where she 's gotten herself . " Is that nothing is promised . Do you know what I mean ? Approximately ? Nobody ever wrote a contract with you about the way your life is going to be . This is n't the only way it could be turning out , either , you know ? Believe it or not , there are worse things . And when you realize that you stop a lot of the fighting against it . It 's like when my kids think they 've been promised something and they do n't get it  --  fury , you know ? But really , the truth is , 153  | every second it 's up for grabs . Everything is . " She smiles a little : this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a long empty silence . Miss Landgraf stands twisting her limber ankle around and around . " And that 's the profound truth you 've learned ? That everything 's up for grabs ? " Laura gives her a bitter half-laugh . " As far as I 've gotten that 's it . Do you want to hear something more Eastern than that ? More Freshman-philosophical ? You like fancy packages ? " " Well , I guess that just does n't seem to be much to show for all this . Somehow . Maybe nothing would sound like enough , I do n't know . " Dan wants to announce that Laura went to Wellesley . He keeps his teeth clenched . Laura 's lips are pale but she continues to smile ; it is her authority that smiles , while her weakness lets the blood run out . " Goodbye , Miss Landgraf . Do n't fall into the printing press , it 'll shred you up finer than you 'd believe . " " Wow , " Miss Landgraf says , retreating . She stops , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She beats her notebook angrily against her knuckles . " I did n't come over here to hurt anybody 's feelings and if I did I 'm sorry . But I do n't think you people know how you come on ? " " Come on ? " asks Laura fiercely . " I did n't know we came on at all , I thought that was the problem . " The women regard each other dryly . Phoebe Landgraf shrugs finally , giving up her side as if it did n't matter . When the sheepbells have tittered against the front door , Dan says gently , " I 'm sorry . That was a joke , Lor . I do n't think she was real . " Laura stretches again , restless . " I bring out the best in people . "  | " Well , I think she was scared of you , that can make people say things they 're not responsible for , you know . But Jesus , I like that kind of honesty , it 's like a howitzer division . Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people . " " If I let that get to me , " Laura says , and lets it rest . ' When she is exhausted , her eyes sink into a dangerous greyness . " Well , I guess we are a kind of people . I guess we 've got to think about that a little . " Hope leaps in Dan , one small sharp fragment of it ; it is more than she 's given him before , that " we . " They sit together in a pall like falling evening . This is what it would be like to be old anyway , ordinary and old , and sit here rocking , Dan thinks , looking back at all the untouchable memories they share . No one else can do a thing but bruise them ; honor them a little , for all that 's worth , but mostly step among them handling them , knocking them down . That 's what makes a kind of people out of anyone , no matter what they 're joined by , love or habit , murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say Life is life is n't . I never was ambitious . But the other thing , after-the-fact , the sometime thing : the side of " specialness " that is no euphemism . That  --  very hard to say , I tiptoe through the words and wo n't hear them out loud  --  I 've been saved from the ordinary ? There is no one life , standard , parts interchangeable , but it does seem we expect it , the props we dream of pushed into their places . I know I married Dan to jog all that . To pull the rug out . My thorough boy , you did bring the whole house down around the little Oriental ! Now I will not be interrupted every three minutes : I can steep myself in time and feel my colors change . The 155  | dark is an impasto , thick and full of unexpected reds and purples , did you know that ? Laura ? Begin there . Two o'clock : They look at each other through an imagined twilight . Guilty in the face of Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised him . Billy Bickford came to take Dan fishing . Go , I did n't say , I do n't want to be hated the way your eyes are . Your damn fingers drumming . So I had grilled cheese with the children who burnt their fingers twice but were afraid to howl , and they did what I told them and Hallie stared into the urine pool . " Kadota figs have that exact same color , " she told me and I said we could buy some and compare . She combed my hair so she could put her green bow in it . " You 're sure you ca n't comb hair , " she said to me squinting . " Because I see you raise your arms . " Malingerer , her mother ! " Good , Halliburton , you hold me to things like that . " She needs approving though no more than ever . I need to approve . " But it 's the brush , holding the brush , and all that raising and lowering so fast and pushing hard . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dug the bow on a bobby pin into my hair but short hair has no catch to it . The bow fell into the seat behind me and she wriggled her fingers in to get it and I laughed though there was no tickle . But there is more to me than ever she thought and it 's going to sit a while and make a knick in my skin , a wrinkle . It 's easier to be alone with her but shame still makes her timid , she is without energy like someone else 's child . She  | left the top off the milk and the milk on the counter and the counter under crumbs and I yelled the way I always did and the air broke open a little and out shook a few tears . But she was smiling too , I think , to hear me nattering so she could be mad and safe at the same time and blame me for it . Old times . Ric Frede turns up into the driveway just before dinner . He is a writer who lives around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If it is n't the roof falling in , " he says cheerfully to Dan , " it 's piles of books . I had a stack so high it fell over the edge of the loft and nearly got my kids down at the bottom . Hardcovers . So I figured I 'd better get on it . " " What a way to go , " Dan says noncommittally . He is assessing the nature of the request : charity ? A little makework at generous prices ? He plays poker with Ric in one season , baseball in another . Sometimes they watch the Superbowl together , each a little bit flattered at the other 's unlikely company . The man is compact , contained ; behind his mustache he may be smiling , but then he may not . Whatever Dan does n't understand of him he has always assumed to be a function of professional mysteriousness . " If you 're too busy with Laura I can take them someplace else , " he is saying now in the kitchen doorway , making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a favor or a  --  you know , a blight  --  to bring you work . " Dan makes plans to come to do the measuring . When he walks Ric to his car , Ric stops . " I had a funny experience last night , Danny , I hope this wo n't seem impertinent . I fell asleep , it was late and I was up working ? The stuff puts me out sometimes , it really does . Fifth rewrite . Can you imagine 157  | tearing the nails out five times ? Anyway , I just put my head down on my arm at the desk for a minute and when I woke up , I do n't know how much later , my whole arm was gone . Asleep , I mean . Incredible ! " " Why was it incredible ? Ric is getting into the car . He goes on talking through the open window . " I just mean I had no feeling in the whole arm , shoulder to fingers , and it was terrifying , that 's all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flop the whole thing around like a ? I do n't know , it felt like a tree limb or something . And ? do n't be offended , I hope this is n't awful to say  --  I just thought , Laura Courser , Jesus , poor Laura , is that what she goes around feeling ? ' I kept looking down at it and there was no damn connection . Like somebody else 's except it was there and I had to move it . I kept knocking over the stuff on my desk , my coffee cup and stacks of paper , and sort of banging it around at odd angles . I really clipped myself . " Ric shows him a scraped knuckle . He shakes his head but does n't take his eyes off Dan , as if Dan were telling him the story . " I only wanted to tell you , I just thought for a minute I could really feel for her . Petty as it was . That 's all . " " That 's plenty , " Dan says , flushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's about as close as we 're gon na get , is n't it ? " The man 's effort touches him . Why must a Phoebe Landgraf 's fear for herself make Laura into a damn fool when there are so many kinds of curiosity possible  --  a thousand shades of it like samples of paint in fine gradations  --  to be given like small gifts that take nothing from the giver ? I 'm bleeding . It is n't fair so much goes on so unimpeded . ( The doctor said good , good . ) Call the neighborwomen , I want to say . Danny , go out and play . Gently he binds  | the wound of my health . If the pad chafes at my thighs I 'll never know . He keeps watch , comes to check , arrange , ask coolly how I feel . Forgive me , please forgive me . I tell him , angry , Fine , fine . The blood cakes between my legs but it keeps coming . Days of it . I want to touch his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wood . He has applied for four construction jobs but has heard from none . Now he is trying to design a frame that will help her get out of bed herself . Laura complains that it looks like a gallows . She has taken to reading a book a day ; she has asked him to send for a college catalog : his own flowerless college with its buildings that feel like airplane hangars . Sometimes she sits in the small room that has his construction table in it , turning pages with her wrist , cursing when the book goes over the edge of her lap table , watching him , moving her head to the rhythm of his sanding as if it were a primitive music . There is a fine small breeze that they share ; it comes in at the window behind Dan 's head and raises a few of his cowlick hairs , which makes him look like Jon . He can almost forget what he is building . I want a book and a hard one . I do n't know anything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject . And the less I am the harder to master . This is a sensory deprivation too . So I want to study untouchable matters : the stone formations of Crete , learn about Ramadan and Lupercal , get enough Spanish to dream in . I shove the pages over with my whole hand , a fist like 159  | a bear tipping a honey pot , but when I turn them they stay turned . Fallen from Dan 's pocket . Hallie hands the slip of paper to me , smooths it carefully like a treasure map . ( My friend Noreen at the Institute found a note one weekend home that told her why her husband smiled at her so much . Enough to burn holes in her eyeballs , the details , she said , signed with her neighbor 's name . ) WHEELCHAIR PUSH-UP BLOCKS is what it says . ?

If it is raised over % " the dowel should be longer than the original 2 1/2 " . A love letter . Good God , she has her gentleman callers : Dougie brings a book , just drops it into Jon 's hands and vanishes . ( " He 's weird , " Jon says but he ca n't give reasons . Well , everyone is weird , to kids ; imagine what they 'd say about their mother if she were n't theirs . ) But Dan , not a child , thinks the same and can give reasons . He sees Dougie trailing a black cape , twirling a cane or a whip . Right , a whip . Fwht , fwht : a giant z flayed in the khaki front lawn , the mark of Zorro MacD , heroic impostor . " Is there a note ? " he asks Jon , shaking the book open . All the worse  --  she 's expected to know who it 's  | from and probably why . The book is something called A Rebours by A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a family resemblance to Zorro MacD . Is he sending a code message , from Weird to Weird ? Dan sees Dougie stretching a pink towel over the telltale spot in his bed . She has the power to make men as helpless as she is . And John comes , looking humbler still . Gentle and only a tinge abashed ; some kind of smile leaks around the edges of his brusqueness . Making a salad , complaining to himself about his brother 's inexplicable presence , Dan cuts his finger on the long tomato knife that has a blade so slender it 's nearly invisible . He watches the blood stand in a thick drop on the side of his finger , piled like mercury , unmoving . What do they talk about in there ? The pain in his finger is disembodied , it makes him uncomfortable everywhere and nowhere ; his chest flutters the way it does when he 's played ball too long in noonday sun . He sucks on it , comfort in the moist warm care of mouth against open flesh , self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that is not guaranteed is that you will ever see your wound ; that you will ever feel it . He is sure he could never be secretly injured like Laura . He would bleed and howl , would drip and stain . Hallie has been sent to help with supper . She is setting up a cookiemaking operation silently , with a poise that is almost effrontery ; she struggles with the ten-pound bag of flour but does not ask for help . Dan keeps his finger in his mouth , teasing the sharp flap of skin while he stirs up meat for the hamburgers . But Hallie is of the internal bleeding school herself nowadays and , though she keeps her eyes on him while she feels around blindly in the closet for the crackling bag of chocolate bits , she does n't notice him at all . I w 161  | Why did n't I teach them a thousand things  --  how to get the bottle caps off , all about bleach , dry ingredients in one bowl , wet ones in the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stripe  --  as if I were going away any minute ? Everyone ought to expect to be gone any minute . But they are kitchen-illiterate and it is my fault only . I do n't care about the shiny floors any more than I care about anything but inertia carries you somewhere if not forward , gives the illusion of movement and now I know how it is for so many , inertia is what powers everything : the forward action once begun is all there is and if you stop " High arches , " Laura says . " Sweet voice , " says Dan . " Clean uniform . " " Strong hands . " " Independent income . " " Unflappable  --  when things start flying around here ? " " Not too pretty , huh ? " She makes a face . " Is n't that supposed to be my line ? " " Where in the hell do we find such a creature , " Dan muses , ignoring her . " Mother told me she knows somebody very good who she thinks would be willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? In the house ? Somebody your mother knows ? Why does n't she just bug the rooms herself the way she 's always wanted to ? " " Listen , I 'm not sure you 're going to get as much veto power as you want , you know . " " Because ? " " Because they 're paying . " " Thanks for reminding me . " " A fact , that 's all . Nothing personal . "  | " I know , nothing personal . But you know they play it for all it 's worth . I 'd rather pay interest . " " Oh , be grateful , Dan . Do you know what you 'd have to do if it were n't for their help ? " He knows , he knows all too well he 'd have to hold a different job with each hand ; he 'd end up envying her for getting to sit down all day . A little fortune has gone into Laura and barely left a mark . An inheritance . " They ought to call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " It makes him impatient to think the luck of having Laura extends into her parents ' safe-deposit vault . " Do you think they owe you a medal ? " " Shit . " " What does that mean ? That expression is so precise . " " I do n't know . It means  --  did you know Hyland raised about three , four thousand dollars for you ? My family ? " Her face hardens . The smile lines down the sides of her nose tense , the shine rises along their ridges . " What do you mean ? " " I mean what I said . They did everything in the book for you , boy , they called out the heavy equipment . Dances , a penny sale , a magic show . Maestro D and his Disappearing Dog , Binky . Collection boxes .

I guess it 's still there , I have n't really looked for so long  --  and it had a telephone pole right through the middle of it . And I used to climb all the way up and just sit there looking down on the yard and the roof and my bike and all . But the best part was , from the street nobody could tell how I got up there . Just sat on the lilacs , it looked like . Like a lavender bubble bath .

Electric chairs are for murderers , they ought to be buying it for me . " " Oh such self-pity , pity , pity . You are shameless . " " You know you can say facts ' like that to me like some hard-assed businesswoman but underneath you see how sentimental you are with your lilac bush . You think you can con me with your flowers and your little bike lying in the driveway ? " " What am I trying to con you about ? I do n't understand this argument , what are we doing ?

Where is your asshole , darling ? It 's got to be here somewhere . Does them gently but as a stranger hurrying through , whisking the washcloth like a pro in all the places he knows by heart all eyes closed except the inner . Hums . Talks to me his statue . The VFW monument lies in his bed , wants its shoes of , its neck rubbed . He is like a whore dealing sex without kissing : the job gets done . I am the job . If someone else does me , will he talk to me again ? The first woman who came had retired from the hospital though she still wore white stockings and shoes and a snood . A snood ! " Put to pasture , " Dan said . " Laura could have lifted her . " The second was dismissed by Laura . " Peremptory chal-165  | lenge . You want to know why ? She smiled too much . Anybody who sees me and goes on smiling without missing a beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fair , " John objects when she tells him . He is visiting again on the way home from work . He sits in his grease-dipped longies and lets the day wash off ; drinks beer and smiles enigmatically with his mouth closed , which Dan thinks makes him look as if he 's suppressing an endless belch . " Of course it 's not fair , " says Laura . " What 's fair ? But it 's true . " John shakes his beer to see if it 's empty . When he tips to drink the last of it , the back of his head touches the chair . He will go home and tell Donna he caught Big Dan in an apron . Donna will say " It would n't do you any harm once in a while ? " but John will walk out of the room thinking less of Dan than ever for being used against him . Laura looks at his lean bony neck , all Adam 's apple under a day 's good growth of beard . He is one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he is with women , and proud of it . She is intent on bringing the two together a fraction ; on teaching John a thing or two , for her own sake , about the limits of sweetness . " The fact is , we do n't , I do n't , need a nurse actually . I need a human being of some sort , I 'm not quite sure which , who is n't squeamish , and who 'll be decent to have to wake up to every day . " " Sunny face . " " No , not a sunny face , heaven forbid . That 's what I 'm telling you , I ca n't stand sunny faces . Smiling through . Those old wartime nurses the soldiers fell in love with . Just somebody with the wit to be ? " She shakes her head . " Forget it , John , you 've read too many get-well cards . " Dan sees how John lets her hurt him .

" She likes that ; cocks her head , smiling ; no one smiles back . But John looks at her quietly , at how she is like a woman posing a hundred years ago for a glass plate portrait , sitting still for the camera , suppressing her motion . It is her weightlessness , maybe , the way her feet never move on their metal rests . You could call it repose if you do n't like to think of it as helplessness . John 's wife never stops twitching  --  even in her lethargies , which are frequent and which lay her out on the flowered couch , she seems to be vibrating , twanging .

" But nice , I guess " ) . " Well , nice enough . She sort of looks like Julia Child , actually . " " Julia Child does n't look like Frankenstein . " " You 're right , " Laura concedes . " How odd . " She frowns . " She seems a little timid in spite of her size . And why would somebody let her certificate run out ? " " Well , the stuff you asked if she could do , I 'd have been timid .

Everywhere there is one tree that thrives on neglect . ) He is used to paring back trees to make them thrive . Today he wishes he could sow the ground with poison . Some of the branches are so lithe he ca n't clip them , he holds them with difficulty and mutilates their skin , tears down to the unripe white pith , but they still snap back . Stripping the bark , flaying the little ones , he feels vaguely sick to his stomach . It would take nothing at all ? only someone , maybe one of the children watching him from the border of the scruffy grass , saying not a single word  --  to  | make him see how he is hurting them , how they must feel their skin being ripped off . He is holding out his own hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his fierce dammed anger flows through them gratefully . There is a part of him that expects to hear the torn branches cry out to stop . If there is , that is the part that will refuse . See him loving his house , this burgher pleasing his mother 's hungry memory . His eyes stroke its solid , its vintage , its decent frame . It is his modest woman of good carriage . Some men have pointy cars to make them men . I loved him first for his refusals I remember for giving the finger to all that , slipping my hand where he did in the same room as my parents with a straight face , so suddenly earnest why did n't they wonder ? Laura Jane Shurrock was not much of a good girl ever in spite of , because of , dancing lessons , piano , braces , silk and once a champagne rinse in my endless hair , and thought she was marrying beautifully badly a hood with potential , charm , bad grammar , sweet knees , a kiss that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom was the best question , and he lay down like a docile cat under kindness , more naked of pretense than anyone . His only vanity is body love and I have always taken what I could of that coming on our knees to each other . I saw him standing among his weedy friends , intense , separated by his intensity , then mine , as he raised his leg and stepped out of the circle . And now cat 's got his cream and he loves the woodwork . August before last ( now I remember ) he traded me for a set of new gutters , I heard him talk like a lover to the brand-new flashing . He 'd rather have reconstructed  | a lintel or gone on his knees searching for ancient squarehead nails . Fell into bed like Jon when he 's played too hard . I had to pull his workboots off , sat back on my heels studying the design of mud caked into the tread . That would have been our next fight , I was angry and amused and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other woman taking him away . And he 's still loyal to her . And the house still hates me . The morning Jenny the nurse is to come Dan awakens depressed . He lies still , prods himself to see what hurts . They have missed each other , that 's all . They have moved all around a tiny room , feeling their way , she with no touch , he with no vision , and between them they have managed to reach right past one another without ever laying a hand on . Now that this other face is going to come to hang there between them like a bare bulb in a socket , there will always be a stranger to keep them half-satisfied , civil and unrelated . Could that be ? He touches her shoulder gently and her arm , touches her hip and her leg , up on the platform of her air mattress ; it 's time to roll her , in her cage , towards her new keeper . He is feeling her skin as if it were braille , his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dan ? " " Oh honey , " he says , " I 'm saying goodbye , that 's all . I feel like I 'm giving you away to a stranger . " He dares to turn her over , which is done with an effort . She is looking at him wide-eyed . He does surprise her sometimes . " See , I had my time alone with you but it did n't come to what I expected . "  | " What do you mean ? Whatever did you expect ? " Lying down she is stiller than ever . If her arms are raised they will stay where they are forever , looking for gravity , abandoned . If she wanted to put them around him he would never know . He does n't answer her . Does n't she know how he 's failed ? She looks alarmed . He only pins her eyes with his and holds them . Ten count . One fall . Then the day begins to come towards them out of the distance , borne forward on the children 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shattered queen lies on the pantry floor dropped from the highest shelf . Pennies have poured out of her eyes , her broken side , and every porcelain fingertip rolled into a different corner . Who comes to tidy up ? Is it the new queen in a skirt round as a barrel , impenetrable , her wrists shining , her shoes pointy , or is that the servant hired by the queen who will put the woman together with the saliva of her own devotion and graft her fingers to the queen 's , hold them so tight ( the queen feels nothing ) that they will grow together , and the queen will have a hand ? But Jenny lasts thirty-six hours . Laura says , " Oh God , I can see it , it 's the old Servant thing . " " What does that mean , the old Servant thing ' ? " Jenny is safely upstairs trying to make the children 's beds . Dan is cutting lunch meat for her , he looks like a patient young father assisting his child , so clean-shaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washer a lot to keep his undershirts
