txt Letters Inflation : ' Nobody Wants to Stop Being Greedy ' To the Editor : Excessive profit margins are the culprits in inflation today. ? But nobody wants to stop being greedy . Instead , blame it on " inflation . " Over four years ago I wrote to you on the subject of " Sacred Profits " ( March 16. 1974 ) regarding a G.M. price increase following a period of record profits . Prices and profits continue to escalate . What " goes back into the economy " is not counted as inflationary by most of our economic experts . My guess is that most wages do . But a lot of the excessive markups do not . And this applies to our multinational conglomerate friends too . However , we are getting smarter with Carter . Our steel producers are going to moderate the announced $10 increase ? maybe to $9.98 ? We have been having a trade deficit . Because our products are not good or because we have been blithely pricing ourselves out of the foreign markets ? Oil imports can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glut on the West Coast from Alaskan oil is announced after about a decade of planning , as if the West Coast were not part of the U.S.  --  and after 800 miles of steel pipe for the Alaska oil line was bought from Japan . Who 's kidding whom ? Of course there 's an oil " shortage , " for as long as oil companies demand excessive profits . When my furnace fuel oil goes from 19 cents to 51 cents a gallon the percentage increase is very large indeed  --  quite a markup . But to get a cost breakdown on various consumer items is abcut impossible . But add all costs , including a fair profit for each item , then subtract this amount from the selling price . This will be the excess profit margin , the major cause of inflation today . Senator Truman before World War II had the guts to reduce profiteering by big business and big unions alike . His investigations applied mostly to war production then . We might use similar procedures to cut profit margins now with the emphasis on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts . A. H. WHITELAW North Stonington , Conn. , April 3 , 1978 The Reluctant Refineries To the Editor : The April 3 issue of The Times carried articles that are more than mildly thought-provoking . One cites the problems of Alaskan crude oil on the Vest Coast . Elsewhere , you note President Carter 's threat to impose an import fee of $5 per barrel on all imported crude if his energy proposal is defeated . It would appear that much of the problem centers on the obvious reluctance of major West Coast refineries to utilize Alaskan crude . Properly handled , the Alaskan supply could conceivably make the current importation of 700,000 barrels per day of Indonesian crude unnecessary . True , certain adjustments to California 's economy would have to be made . However , the whole purpose of the North Slope and the Alaskan pipeline is to increase self-sufficiency . This seems to have been neatly negated by the self-interests of a handful of refiners whose obvious concern is the bottom line . Was not the problem of distribution and refining of Alaskan crude foreseen ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a long-range selfsufficiency plan , what business have we in discussing significant goals a decade hence ? One wonders at the strength of the oil lobby if the Oval Office is unable to deal effectively with the comparatively small problem of an excess of only a million barrels a day . Somewhere in the equation , the concept of the greatest good for the greatest number has a place  --  perhaps not in the minds of the refiners , but , one hopes , on Pennsylvania Avenue . RICHARD R. HILL Sherburne , N.Y. , April 5 , 1978 Charity 's Gain To the Editor : Your editorial of April 5 ( " Let the Charity Fit the Crime ? " ) is imprecise in stating the Federal Treasury will lose $510,000 as a result of Judge Zampano 's order requiring the Olin Corporation to make a " charitable contribution " in lieu of paying a fine . More likely , his decision will cost the Government $765,000 . The corporation will probably be able to deduct the " charitable contribution " from income and reduce its tax liability ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A fine , by contrast , is not deductible . After tax , a $510,000 contribution costs Olin $255,000 ; so the Treasury loses $510,000 plus $255,000 in taxes . Thus , while it may seem that Judge Zampano was ordering a peculiar sanction against Olin , in fact he was only performing his duty and imposing sentence of an appropriate magnitude under the circumstances . He held that Olin should suffer a net loss of $255,000 , but he arranged for a net social benefit of $510,000 . How can you criticize such a decision ? Condemn the lawmakers who write the tax code , but spare the judge . JONATHAN D. Kauatir New York , April 6 , 1978 Of Realty and Taxes To the Editor : A factual difference between my letter and the letter of Carl G. Dincesen Jr . ( both published on April 8 ) requires clarification . Mr. Dincesen would make it seem that the current city real property tax levy ( levied in July , 1977 , for the 1978 fiscal year ) was at 99.9 percent of the operating limit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levied in July of 1976 ) . The current tax levy was $97.4 million less than the legal limit , according to New York City 's submission to the State Department of Audit and Control dated July I , 1977 , It might also be pointed out that the tax limit is applied to average full value . RICHARD HARTMAN Counsel N.Y.C. Patrolmen 's Benevolent Assn . New York , April 8 , 1978 To the Editor : The discussion in your letters column regarding the international status of Tibet strikes very close to home . I wrote the first draft of the legal analysis part of the 1959 report of the International Commission of Jurists on the status of Tibet and published what seems to have become the definitive article on the subject in China Quarterly No. 35 , 1968 , supplemented by a series of short articles and book reviews in the American Journal of International Law , Citations of the 1960 International Commission of Jurists report to support an Indian or exiled Tibetan position , and of some very selected facts to support a Chinese position , reiterate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But neither a useful statement of facts nor a comprehensible legal argument can be compressed into a letter . My own conclusion is that the political society of Tibet was incorporated into the Chinese empire in the early 18th century , much as the political societies of the princely states of India and the unfederated Malay states were made British protectorates in the late 19th and early 20th ; that the dominant groups in Tibet progressively asserted a degree of independence from 1912 to 1951 which , although usually stopping short of anything properly called a declaration of independence , might he viewed as cumulatively and increasingly evidencing a self-confidence inconsistent with continued Chinese claims to authority ; that Sino-Tibetan negotiations culminating in the agreement of 1951 are legally tainted in some ways , but in practice did form Monolingual Welcome To the Editor : I had occasion recently to revisit the Statue of Liberty after an absence of many years . Her majestic yet beckoning stance in the harbor rekindled in me feelings of old that ours is still a land in which newcomers of myriad nations can indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The on-premises Immigration Museum bore witness to the fact that America had in the past been settled by those of diverse nationalities , and the manytongued voices of those around me gave testimony that the great lady and the great land were still attracting . in large numbers those from foreign shores . Only one thing puzzles and confuses me . Wherever one goes in Europe , especially to tourist attractions , one hears announcements of events in three , four and sometimes even five languages to assure that those in attendance can fully understand and appreciate what is taking place , Why , then , at a monument to freedom and liberty to which we invite the entire world , are we so shortsighted and narrow-minded as to restrict our announcements to the English language ? Could we not at least accommodate via foreign-language recordings a few of the other tongues represented , so that our visitors might feel as warmly welcomed in words as in images ? It seems such a small gesture that might well make quite a difference to so many . ELAINE BERMAN Port Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese authority in Tibet , much as British treaties with Indian princes and Malay sultans had done a half century before and , indeed , Indian political and military action in Hyderabad , Kashmir and Goa were doing at the same time , and that the effective Chinese control in Tibet for the past 27 years ends the legal questions . Of course , Chinese legal rights can not extend to insuring Tibet either politically or legally against revolution . Thus the legal questions as argued in your letters column seem irrelevant to any real issues ALFRED P. RUBIN Professor of International Law Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy Tufts University Medford , Mass. , March 31 , 1978 How Japanese Wives Adjust to New York To the Editor : The news article about the strain Japanese wives experience living in New York ( March 14 ) points to a real problem , but it presents a one-sided picture . The wives coming to the United States today are increasingly self-confident and eager to practice their English . Moreover , the communications network for Japanese residents in the New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better information about local activities available in newsletters and on television ( channel 47 ) . In 1975 , the Japanese School of New York opened for children destined to cope with entrance exams when they return to Japan . A group known as Hiroba ( Forum ) meets regularly at the Japan Society to share ideas and experiences about living in the U.S. This group is open to all Japanese women living in the area , and members deliberately avoid talking about their husbands so as not to fall into the habit of ranking themselves according to their husbands ' positions . Hiroba has produced a useful guide to the practical problems of living in the New York area . The Japanese booklet is now in its second edition and has sold more than 8,000 copies .

TATSURO GOTO Chairman , Mitsui &; Co . ( U.S.A. ) , Inc . New York , March 24 , 1973 Wasted Billions To the Editor : In your issue of April 4 you report on $6 billion misspent by H.E.W . The loss is actually twofold : First , it is money which could otherwise have reduced the Federal debt , and second , as it actually increased the debt , compound interest will mount on it indefinitely or as long as the Federal Government has a deficit . Estimating each cost . at 6 percent interest , this $6 billion drain will reach S15.3 billion in 10 years , almost $40 pillion in 20 , and about $85 billion in 30 years . This last total is more than 10 percent of our present Federal deficit .
