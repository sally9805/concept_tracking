 | EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT : WHAT 'S IT ALL ABOUT ? @# RARELY has a proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution caused such an uproar . Seldom have battle lines been so tightly drawn and emotions so highly charged ? and rarely has misinformation been so widespread . A Constitutional issue has never dragged on for so long without being resolved . At issue : the Equal Rights Amendment ( ERA ) ? a 24-word statement in standard Constitutional language : " Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex . " Endorsed by both major political parties , by all Presidents since Dwight Eisenhower , by organized labor , and by more than loo business , professional , religious and public organizations , ERA was overwhelmingly passed by Congress and sent to the states for ratification on March 22 , 1972 . Today , almost five years later , that " Magna Carta " for women remains more elusive than anyone could have suspected . For something funny happened on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the states must give their approval before the measure becomes law . At the end of 1976 , ERA was still four states short of the magic number . If it remains unratified for two more years ? until March 1979 ? it automatically becomes extinct . The strength of the growing opposition became dramatically apparent in November 1975 , when the voters in New York and New Jersey went to the polls to decide whether to accept separate ERAS on the state level . Both states had ratified the federal measure and an easy victory was predicted ; yet the resolutions were unexpectedly defeated . Suddenly , ERA was headline news . Built-In Bias . What had happened ? " Lack of real understanding of what ERA was about , plus the stridency of some of the more militant proponents , caused the defeat in New York and New Jersey , " ex- plains Rep. Edward Koch ( D. , N.Y. ) , a supporter of the amendment . " Many women began to think they were being pushed into something they did n't want and did n't understand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to be equal with a man . I just want to be a woman . " Moreover , half of all married women in the United States are full-time homemakers ; most say they are content with marriage , home and family . So why the need for change ? Because , answer proponents , ERA is a matter of simple justice which should have been part of the law all the time . Women make up more than half the U.S. population , and nine out of ten of them will work at some point in their lives . Indeed , they are entering the labor force at a pace that Eli Ginzberg , chairman of the National Commission for Manpower Policy , calls " the single most outstanding employment phenomenon of our century " ? 35 million strong , 40 percent of all working people . Yet a recent study showed that , for identical work , men earn at least 20 percent more than women . Women are often last to be hired , first to be fired . Pension , retirement rates and insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bias are reflected throughout the laws of our society . In Louisiana , for example , a husband can sell family property without his wife 's permission , but she can not do the opposite . Women students are denied equal opportunity for scholarships . And property laws in most states give no weight to the non-financial contributions of a housewife ? if the husband pays for things with his earnings , they belong to him . Proponents say that ERA will unify this dual system of justice , wiping from the books those federal , state and local laws that treat men and women differently . It will be , they say , a human-rights bill for women . " Nonsense ! " says Phyllis Schlafly , national chairman of STOP ERA , the main opposition force , with chapters . in 45 states . She says flatly : " ERA is the greatest ripoff of the homemaker ever conceived . Current state laws require husbands to provide their wives with a home and to support them and their minor children . Women already enjoy superior rights . " Pandora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? There are no hard and fast answers . ERA is not , however , just a zany " women 's lib " idea . First introduced to Congress in 1923 , it has been around for 54 years ; and most of its backers are concerned , thoughtful men and women who believe the time has come for an equal working partnership between the sexes . Nonetheless , serious doubts persist over the full ramifications of ERA . Opponents say they are not against abolishing sex discrimination , but ask if a Constitutional amendment is the wisest way to do it . Ex-Sen . Sam Ervin , for instance ,  | has compared the amendment to the use of " an atomic bomb to exterminate a few mice , " pointing out that c legislation already on the books can accomplish many of ERA 's goals : Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act , which bars sex discrimination in employment ; the Equal Pay Act of 1963 ; the 1972 Education Amendments ? and the 14th Amendment , which guarantees " any person . . the equal protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women are indeed seeking and obtaining relief under existing laws , but the case-by-case burden to prove discrimination is too time-consuming and costs more than many can afford . Enforcement of the statutes is often lax , and in some areas the case load is overwhelming . The Equal Employment Opportunities Commission , for example , has a backlog of more than oo , 000 discrimination charges . As for the 14th Amendment , although the Supreme Court has consistently used it as a check against discrimination directed at racial , religious and ethnic groups , as well as to ensure the legal rights of juveniles and even criminals , the Court has been slow to apply it to women . Not until 1971 did the Court decide a case in favor of a woman under the " equal protection " clause of the Constitution ? and then only in the shadow of ERA 's imminent passage . But the Court still refuses to make a blanket ruling that sex discrimination , like racial discrimination , is fundamentally wrong . Says Prof. Thomas I. Emerson , a respected Constitutional authority at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ERA might not have been necessary . " Few experts deny that granting full legal rights to women is fraught with uncertainty , no matter how well deserved those rights are . Opponents believe that ERA could open a Pandora 's box of litigation . It would almost certainly result in changes throughout society ? some subtle , others perhaps painful . Still , ERA is not flying as blind as some fear . As Professor Emerson points out , " The Constitution is neither framed nor interpreted in a vacuum . The legislators develop extensive guidelines to help the courts later decide the shape of just what it was that Congress had in mind . " These guidelines consist mainly of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees Reports , statements of sponsors of the legislation involved , testimony of committee members who back the measure , and supporting documentation . All of this makes up what is termed " legislative history , " which represents the true intent of Congress . " It is to legislative history ? the spirit of the law , " explains Emerson , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the law . " Another useful tool is the experience of states that have instituted their own ERA S. So far , not one reports problems ? a hopeful sign for the impact of the federal amendment . Far-Reaching Effects . Exactly what would ERA mean in some  | major areas ? Essentially , the concept of equal rights for men and women means equal legal responsibilities as , well . Thus , no longer would the husband alone be legally bound to contribute to family welfare , but the wife , too . This does not mean she has to go out and find a job . Rather , ERA would recognize the non-financial contributions of the housewife and count them as her fair share of family support . Because a homemaker 's contributions would be given legal weight , under ERA , each partner would be considered to have an interest in family property . This means that , in the event of divorce , part of the household assets would go uncontested to the wife . And , in the event of widowhood , the inheritance-tax burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extend rights to either partner according to need , something already being done in 33 states . Child custody , too , would be determined according to whichever partner can best meet the children 's needs , both emotionally and financially . This , too , is being it require him to stop being one . " done in a number of states . ? ERA will not lead to coed ERA would , however , have far- public rest rooms or sex-integrated reaching effects in such public areas dormitories in public institutions . A as labor , education and sports . In . Constitutionally established " right some states , laws restrict working. of privacy " will prevail , guaranteehours for women , set weight-lifting ; . ing separation of the sexes for " dislimitations , mandate rest areas and robing , sleeping and personal bodily meal breaks . Although Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act covers this territory , if the amendment is ratified these restrictive laws would have to be struck down , or extended to include men . All publicly funded schools and universities would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private schools ' would probably remain unaffected . Sports programs in publicly ' ) . funded institutions would be open to ' both sexes , too . The most controversial issue of the entire ERA debate is the draft . There is no compulsory military service in this country today ; but if it should be needed again , women will unquestionably be drafted , under ERA , and on the same basis as men . If inducted , some would most certainly see combat . Crucial Year . As important as what the proposed 27th Amendment would do is what it is not meant to do : ? ERA will not meddle in private lives ? it applies only to governmental action . If a woman likes to have doors held open for her , she will not lose that privilege . " The passage of this amendment , " said one Senator during the debate , " will neither make a man a gentleman , nor will functions . " None of the states with ERA has had any problems with this widely publicized fear . ? It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for- 1 O !  | bid such marriages will rest , as it does now , with each state . ? It will not invalidate rape laws . The Senate Judiciary Report points out that " such laws are designed to protect women in a way that they are uniformly distinct from men . " ? ERA will not abrogate states ' rights . Each state will have two years to bring its laws into conformity with the basic concept of sex neutrality in the eyes of the law . No one , of course , can know what will happen for sure should ERA be passed . The courts will undoubtedly be called on to decide many issues , one by one in 50 states , and from that body of decisions will emerge the true shape of ERA . Whether those courts will follow the intent of Congress , as set forth in the legislative history , is a worry in some people 's minds . But the Supreme Court is the final arbiter , an institution that has served us for 200 years and is likely to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent Gallup poll showed the country behind ERA , 57 percent to 24 percent ( the rest were undecided ) . Last November , Massachusetts became the 16th state to adopt its own ERA , and Colorado 's citizens soundly defeated a proposal to repeal theirs . Both sides agree that 1977 is a crucial year , with many key state legislatures meeting to ponder the issue. * Meanwhile , two states have had a change of heart and have rescinded their original ratification ( Nebraska and Tennessee ) and , if the race is close , Congress must ultimately decide whether or not to accept those reversals . Whatever happens , legal experts on both sides of the issue agree that ERA wo n't mean dramatic changes overnight . The amendment will not provide " magic wand " equality for women any more than the 14th Amendment meant full equality for blacks more than too years ago . Attitudes run deep and take time to change . Nor will the women's-rights issue disappear if ERA goes down to defeat , for it is the crystallization of forces that began 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept that all of us are created equal . @#
