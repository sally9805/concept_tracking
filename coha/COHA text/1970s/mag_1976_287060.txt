A Washington , D.C. , plainclothes policewoman contended that Louisiana Democratic Congressman Joe Waggon-ner Jr . drove up in his car and offered to pay her $50 for an oral sex act . Utah Democratic Congressman Allan Howe allegedly approached two Salt Lake City police decoy prostitutes and promised them $20 if they would show him " a little fun " at their place . Former Judge ( and failed Nixon Supreme Court nominee ) G. Harrold Carswell has been indicted on charges of making advances to a vice-squad policeman in Tallahassee , Fla . Dallas police have accused ex-Army Major General ( and right-wing activist ) Edwin Walker of public lewdness after he allegedly " fondled " an undercover policeman in a rest room . <P> One after another , those scandalous stories have made recent headlines . Carswell and Walker have yet to reply formally to the charges other than to indicate their innocence . But both Wag-gonner and Howe have raised a troubling issue by making a counterallega-tion against the police . They claim they did nothing wrong and were subjected to attempted entrapment-the legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incited or enticed an individual to commit a crime . <P> Trap for Whom ? Today there seems to be a rise in the number of such claims , but in fact the concept has never enjoyed much judicial support . In 1864 a Judge Bacon of New York remembered that the plea was " first interposed in Paradise : ' The serpent beguiled me , and I did eat . ' That defense was overruled by the great Lawgiver , and it has never since availed . " Well , hardly ever . The defense was recognized for the first time in a federal court in 1915 . In two later cases-involving a police agent in 1932 who begged an acquaintance for some bootleg liquor and a paid informer in 1958 who led a reformed addict back to drugs and then got him arrested for dealing-the Supreme Court drew a line " between the trap for the unwary innocent and the trap for the unwary criminal . " <P> While the rule was not exactly defined , it suggested that providing a passive opportunity for crime was O.K. , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line between catching criminals and provoking crime was a simple principle , " says University of Chicago Law Dean Norval Morris . " Now it has been blurred . " Three months ago , the Burger court held by a 5-to-3 vote that if a person has a " predisposition " to commit a crime , it will be almost impossible for him to claim entrapment successfully , no matter how much inducement to the crime the Government has provided . Under the ruling , says Aryeh Neier , director of the American Civil Liberties Union , " if anyone does anything , you can say there must have been predisposition. "
