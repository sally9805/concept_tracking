SPEARPOINT by SYLVIA ASHTON-WARNER 224 pages . Knopf. $5.95 . <P> <P> " What about picking up your blocks , Henry ? " <P> " I dowanna ... and I do n't have to . " <P> " Well , who else is to pick them up ? " <P> " Not me , you dum-dum ! " <P> Once upon a time into the country of the doubly young-five-year-olds , American five-year-olds , living like some future race at an experimental school in the Rockies-there came an elderly stranger . She was doubly alien , a grandmother and a New Zealander . Yet Sylvia Ashton-Warner had her visas in order , even her special credentials . Or so she thought . Had she not written a book called Teacher ( 1963 ) expounding her progressive principle of " organic teaching " ? " Release the native imagery of our child , " she preached , " and use it for working material . " Was not her proudest boast that she was still very much a child herself ? As a lifelong dreamer , why was she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfect open school , providing both learning and freedom " ? <P> The admirable Mrs. Ashton-Warner worked on for seven months , until money for the open-school project ran out . In rhetoric favored by educational revolutionaries , she still insists that " spiritually speaking , millions of children are murdered annually " by conventional teachers who stuff their innocent minds with adult " imagery " instead of appreciating that the point of education is to keep a child " as interesting as he was when he was born . " <P> A certain carefree brio has gone out of her ideological flights these days . The " perfect open school " turned out to be as tooth-shivering a case of reality as fingernails scraping against a blackboard . As far as " learning and freedom " went , Mrs. Ashton-Warner may well have learned more than her rather frightening charges ( " the advance guard of technology , with their long legs , proud faces " ) . And what she learned was mostly about the nature of freedom . Spearpoint is the often oblique but always fascinating account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between " the ruling ogres : Authority and Equality . " <P> New Hope . Authority , the spirit of do it my way , is the clearly identified villain of education ( and everything else ) nowadays . On the other hand , Equality - the attractive notion of teachers and students becoming full partners in the educational process-is all the new hope . But Mrs. Ashton-Warner 's trials among the sandboxes of the Rockies , where even " coax " is a dirty word , taught her that Equality can lead to a subtler , more dangerous tyranny than Authority . <P> " The collective energy in a group of children , " she writes , may be " at its best , sympathy " but " at its worst , mob rule . " Her " wanna-dowanna " Montys , Rockys , Odiles and Candys thump the piano , whack the guitar and slam down their Cuisenaire rods with sublime disregard . There are days of disaster in the clay room . Attacked by American central heating and the tribal chant , " I wan my snack , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : order , privacy , silence , a decent cup of tea .
