When Morton Halperin first went to court three years ago , he had no idea that he would eventually accomplish what no private citizen ever had-a successful suit for damages caused by the official acts of a U.S. President . But Halperin , then 35 , a Yale-trained former staffer on the National Security Council , was furious at learning that the FBI had tapped his telephone . He filed suit against the half-dozen top officials whom he felt had to be held responsible . He even sued the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Co . Last week Morton Halperin won a resounding victory that could cost his tappers , starting with President Nixon , nearly $1 million in damages . <P> The case started with Nixon 's own anger about foreign policy leaks to the press . On May 9 , 1969 , the New York Times reported the secret bombing of Cambodia . That same day the FBI started a series of wiretaps that ultimately monitored the telephones of 13 Government officials and four newsmen for various periods of time until February 1971 . Halperin , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those under suspicion . Within nine months , in fact , he decided to quit . But not until the Watergate disclosures came gushing forth in 1973 did he learn that for 21 months the FBI had eavesdropped on him , his wife and three young sons for " national security " reasons . He demanded $3 million in damages . <P> After three years of legal wrangling , during which the Justice Department took over the defense , Halperin won his basic points . In a 16-page opinion , U.S. District Court Judge John Lewis Smith Jr . ruled that Halperin 's Fourth Amendment rights to protection against unlawful search and seizure had been violated , the taps had uncovered no evidence of wrongdoing by Halperin , and Nixon , former Attorney General John Mitchell and former White House Aide H.R. Haldeman must pay damages <P> " Like any other citizen , " the judge said , " these officials are charged with the knowledge of established law and must be held accountable for personal misconduct . " Halperin 's suit was a civil action and therefore not covered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that occurred during his Administration . <P> Judge Smith found that Nixon was personally liable for damages because he had initiated and overseen the wiretap program without setting specific limits on it . Mitchell , the judge said , was in error because he had failed to review periodically the need for the taps . Haldeman was liable because he too did not put a stop to the monitoring , and in addition used bugs for political spying ( after leaving the NSC . Halperin served for a time as an adviser to Presidential Aspirant Edmund Muskie ) . The judge , however , dismissed charges against three other officials named in the suit , including Secretary of State Henry Kissinger , who had originally listed Halperin as a suspected leak but had played what the judge called an " inactive " role in the actual bugging . <P> Figuring Damages . Though it is still unclear just how the damages against Nixon and his co-defendants will be computed-the judge left that to a later hearing-Halperin 's lawyers want it figured according to the formula now in the federal wiretap law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five Halperins for 630 days would add up to $315,000 against each of the three defendants .
