Can you legislate equality ? One major attempt to do so began with the equal-opportunity hiring practices that business and labor were required to observe by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . <P> The Johnson Administration later extended these regulations to educational institutions . Since then , some 2,000 colleges and universities have been struggling both to come up with " affirmative action " employment programs* acceptable to Washington bureaucrats and to defend themselves against literally hundreds of discrimination suits , many of them brought by women 's rights organizations . Along the way , the 20 leading campuses have temporarily lost more than $28 million in federal research funds-withheld as a penalty for failure to satisfy Government equal-employment watchdogs . <P> Has it all been worth the effort ? In public , college administrators and faculty members ritually endorse affirmative action . But in private , they tell a different story . So says Richard A. Lester , a Princeton economist who visited 20 leading universities in preparing a study on the federal antibias program for the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education . Lester 's report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the drive for equal opportunity in faculties has been a worthwhile effort in theory , and in practice a " painful experience " that has accomplished little for minority groups while doing violence to a long tradition of academic independence and excellence . <P> Lester , 66 , a New Frontier liberal who was vice chairman of President Kennedy 's Commission on the Status of Women , does not quarrel with the argument that minorities and ( especially ) women are vastly underrepresented in higher education . After all , women hold less than 38% of the instructorships and just 5% of the full professorships in U.S. universities . But he does insist that federal efforts to deal with the situation are clumsy and misguided . <P> " Good Faith . " On philosophical grounds , Lester complains that the equal-opportunity program , which is policed by the Department of Health , Education and Welfare and several other agencies , represents a serious Government intrusion into the traditional freedom and independence of American campuses . Beyond that , he complains that Washington administrators are tinkering insensitively with the " highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professorships and the 30-to 35-year tenures that go with them . Universities that want to keep their federal funds are required to come up with " good faith " hiring targets ; Columbia University 's plan for the five years from 1972 to 1977 , for example , called for the hiring of 81 to 101 women faculty members , of whom eleven to 14 would be given tenure . While this may make sense in the case of " typists , bricklayers or punch-press operators , " Lester says , it is hardly appropriate when it comes to " choosing a medieval historian .
