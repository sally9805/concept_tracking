txt a // recognition which might greet a witticism such as Daniel Webster 's " Falsehoods not only disagree with truths , but usually quarrel among themselves . " This chapter takes up this task of reconciling all laughter-provoking incidents as compatible members of the same family . It shows how , starting with primordial man 's roar of triumph , explained in the last chapter , laughter became a civilized and civilizing activity . I agree with Rapp that the developmental process advanced in three " directions . " Thus , each of these directions are detailed , and support for each of these historical developments is offered . But first , a word on definitions ? definitions of those concepts , mentioned in Chapter 3 , which were the agents of the developments . An unfortunate fact of record is that there exists still today considerable numbers of people naive enough to believe that man was created from scratch as a blue-eyed , nearly hairless biped ; that he was imbued from the instant of his creation with a full vocabulary of some Near-Eastern language , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him a companion for conversation ( and for other , nonlinguistic activities ) , his mate was created out of his rib during a nap . In other words , there are still a lot of folks around who do not believe in evolution ( sometimes called " evilution " ) . Such ignorance and stubbornness should not surprise us , however , when one considers the fact , uncovered by both national surveys and sidewalk interviews on the main drag of Athens , Georgia , alike , that in 1974 just about one third of the American people still were not convinced that we have actually landed men on the moon . To such people this chapter , nay even this book , will not make sense . For those to whom sense can be made , I next take up the concept of Carl Jung 's " shadow archetype . " Jung knew that man developed from lower forms of life . He saw it everywhere he looked in the human soul and psyche . And he made it an integral part of his comprehensive theory of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a universal thought form ( idea ) which contains a large element of emotion . This // thought form creates images or visions that correspond in normal waking life to some aspect of the conscious situation . " 2 How does an archetype originate ? " It is a permanent deposit in the mind of an experience that has been constantly repeated for many generations . . . . for instance man has been exposed throughout his existence to innumerable instances of great natural forces ? earthquakes , waterfalls , flood , hurricanes , lightning , forest fires , and so forth . Out of these experiences there has developed an archetype of energy , a predisposition to perceive and be fascinated by power and a desire to create and control power . The child 's delight in firecrackers , the young person 's preoccupation with ' hot-rod ' cars , and the adult 's interest in releasing the hidden energies of atoms have their roots in the archetype of energy . Man is driven by this archetype to seek new sources of energies . " 3 This is how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race experience , over countless generations , the same phenomena with some regularity . This experience gradually " wears a groove " in the collective unconscious of the race , becoming almost like an instinctual part of the general human psychological makeup . I choose the analogy of " wearing a groove " deliberately , because Jung made much the same comparison : Archetypes are like riverbeds which dry up when the water deserts them , but which it can find again at any time . An archetype is like an old watercourse along which the water of life has flowed for centuries digging a deep channel for itself . The longer it has flowed in this channel the more likely it is that sooner or later the water will return to its old bed.4 Jung eloquently explains the strength of the basic animal heritage which each human being carries deep within his psyche ? and sometimes not so deep at all . His words : It is not only primitive man whose psychology is archaic . It is the psychology also of modern , civilized man , and not merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary , every civilized human being , however high his conscious development , is still an archaic man at the deeper levels of his psyche . Just as the human body connects us // with the mammals and displays numerous vestiges of earlier evolutionary stages going back even to the reptilian age , so the human psyche is a product of evolution which , when followed back to its origins , shows countless archaic traits . Just as a man has a body which is no different in principle from that of an animal , so also his psychology has a whole series of lower storeys in which the spectres from humanity 's past epochs still dwell , when the animal souls from the age of Pithecanthropus and the hominids , then the " psyche " of the coldblooded saurians , and , deepest down of all , the transcendental mystery and paradox of the sympathetic and parasympathetic psychoid systems.5 Of course the idea is not original nor unique to Jung , this idea that man is basically an animal who , because of a larger brain and the consequent ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animalism with a thin veneer of civilization . Lately , Walter Meyden , director of the Footlighters Child Guidance Clinic in Hollywood 's Presbyterian Hospital has put it this way : The veneer of civilization is at most 10,000 years . Behind that are a million years of jungle living lived pretty much on an animal level with an animal-type of social organization.6 My belief is that the many generations of men who responded to their sudden victories in violent encounters with roars of triumph , over hundreds of thousands of years , wore a groove , a riverbed , into the collective human unconscious . This tendency to pant and vocalize uproariously at perceptions of " sudden glory , " of victory , can be thought of as being part of what Jung called the " shadow archetype . " This archetype consists of the animal instincts which man inherited in his evolution from lower forms of life . Consequently , the shadow to begin with typifies the animal side of man 's nature. ? Thus man developed an inherent capacity for and tendency to laugh . Acceptance of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow archetype " is bolstered by evidence from child development studies . George Thompson has been led to conclude that , " It // would appear that smiling appears through maturation without special experience , but that many of the circumstances which elicit smiling are learned , even during the first year of life italics mine . " 8 Further , in " A Study of the Smiling and Laughing of Infants in the First Year of Life , " Ruth Washburn found that the number of laughter responses did not change during that first year while the number of smiling responses increased markedly . She concluded : " This , coupled with the fact that the laughing behavior pattern is more stereotyped , suggests that laughing remains a primitive form of behavior expressive of affective states , while smiling , in certain instances assumes the character of a communicative , adaptive response rather than a purely expressive one italics mine . " And so , both the testimony from that eminent scholar and thinker , Carl Jung , and the data of developmental psychologists support the idea that our capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn to laugh or smile , as we must learn to talk , to write , to drive an automobile . Also remember : as evidence cited in Chapter 1 attests , lower animals also possess these mechanisms and capacities . It can only make the finest of good sense , therefore , to assume that our base for laughter , the ancient roar of triumph , might very well have made its imprint upon the collective racial psyche of the higher primates , including man . At least I hope the reader will concede this point temporarily , so that we may look at some other wellestablished psychological concepts which will help explain how a combatant 's victory roar can be father to the chuckle over the cocktail party repartee . First , let us consider the psychological concept of " generalization . " Analytically speaking , there are two kinds of generalization : there is generalization through response substitution and generalization through stimulus substitution . Although we are more concerned with the stimulus substitution , let us exemplify response substitution . Generalization through response substitution occurs when a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulus , and that stimulus becomes effective in eliciting ' similar ' responses . " 9 For example , let 's say you try caviar but hate it ; but you persist , and finally " develop a taste " for it . But caviar is ex54 From Primordial Battle to Joke pensive , you learn ; so you do not buy it often , despite the fact that it tempts your palate . Now , each time you pass through the gourmet section of your food store and spy some caviar , you respond with a desire to buy and eat some . But other responses are likely to occur . You may wish you made more money ; you may wish your wife was less extravagant on clothes so that you could buy caviar more often ; you may feel anger at your boss for refusing your last request for a raise ( and thereby denying you caviar ) ; you may fantasy an instant daydream in which an attractive member of the opposite sex languorously feeds you mountains of caviar , etc . You may even resolve to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in order to be able to buy caviar more often . This is responsesubstitution . But in tracing the various paths from victory roar to snicker over the men 's room graffiti , we are concerned mostly with what is called generalization through stimulus substitution ; for we are interested in the question , " How did the stimulus of the modern joke or witticism come to elicit the ' same ' kind of response as did the sudden success in combat ? " Stimulus substitution is defined as what occurs when a person " learns to make a certain response to a certain stimulus and certain other previously ineffective stimuli will also elicit the conditioned response . " 10 The definition continues : If the stimuli are preceptually " similar , " it is said to be PRIMARY STIMULUS GENERALIZATION . The greater the similarity of the related stimulus to the conditioned stimulus , the more frequently it will elicit the response.11 Reread and remember the last sentence of the above quotation , for its importance will soon be noted . Can we exemplify generalization through stimulus response ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form our stereotypes . We become acquainted , let us say with a gentleman whose national origin is Outer Silurvian ; we react negatively to him because he demonstrates very miserly behavior . Sometime later we encounter an immigrant from Inner Silurvia . He too pinches pennies without mercy . We are apt to conclude that inhabitants of Silurvia and their descendants are an exceptionally thrifty lot ; we may even generalize that foreigners are stingy , and react to all accordingly . // Such stereotypy works favorably , of course , also . For instance , my wife and I have had many fine experiences through meeting , at universities where I have taught , military personnel assigned to ROTC units . We number among our best friends acquired at colleges several such military people ; we therefore expect pleasant social experiences when we meet new ROTC personnel . We must define two more concepts useful in the discussion to follow , " displacement " and " secondary reinforcement . " The definition from Horace B. English and Ava C. English which explains for us " displacement " is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different activity system , resorted to when the usual consummatory response to a situation is prevented.12 " Displacement " is aptly illustrated by the so-called Kick-theDog Psychology . The husband has a tough day at work with his boss , whom he can not tell off . So he comes home keyed up and angry , and blows his stack at his wife . The wife , angered yet afraid of the huffy husband , vents her spleen on six-year-old Johnny , their son . The upset child dares not " sass " his mom back , so he takes out his anger with a boot to the tail of Rover . " Secondary reinforcement " or " secondary reward " is defined as " a reward that has become a source of satisfaction through learning , usually ( perhaps always ) from association with another object or stimulus situation that is satisfactory . " 13 Eating a filet mignon in a nice restaurant will satisfy your primary drive for food ( primary reinforcement ) but may also give you a feeling of general well-being , will almost certainly please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich " or " extravagant " ( secondary reinforcements ) . Definitions are now finished and , there is hope the lesson is learned . Now , let us get back to that roar of triumph . A. The Ridicule Road In Chapter 1 we saw how Katharine Hull Kappas defined " ridicule . " Let us now look at a more common definition : ri-di-cule ( ridi-kul ) n F. , adj &; n. , fr . L. ridiculus ridiculous , neut. ridiculum a jest , fr. ridere to laugh. 1 . Act or practice of causing laughter by poking fun at another person ; remarks or actions intended to make people laugh at some // person . 2 . A laughingstock ; a butt of jokes . ? at . To laugh at or make fun of mockingly or contemptuously . Syn . Ridicule , deride , mock , taunt , quiz , chaff . As I have indicated earlier , especially in Chapter 2 , there is always some element of ridicule in a humorous situation . Sometimes the ridicule is highly recognizable as such . For instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's retort to noisy drunks , the hecklerism : Look buddy , everyone has the right to be stupid , but you abuse the privilege . Pal , after meeting you I can really see why a lot of people are in favor of birth control . But ridicule is also present in the silliest of whimsey stories : A drunk staggered into the street and was knocked down by a car driven by a woman . She stopped , leaned out the window , and said , " You 'd better watch out , young man . " The drunk propped himself up on one elbow and asked : " Why ? You gon na back up ? " And , subtly , women drivers of the world are held up to ridicule en masse . So how did this kind of thing , ridicule , evolve from our triumph roar ? Generalization through stimulus substitution . The way it must have come about is detailed in the next few paragraphs . In the first place , our earliest ancestors must certainly have come to recognize the roar of triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they heard someone else bellow it . They must have come to associate this bellow of victory with the picture of the loser , the other guy . For the loser of a physical battle will bear the signs of the vanquished : battered , bruised , hair and teeth perhaps missing ; maybe limping and/or nursing a painfully wrenched shoulder ; no doubt bleeding a bit here and there ; and quite likely weeping , perhaps in great , wracking sobs . Our progenitors must certainly have become conditioned to know what a defeated , thus inferior combatant looked like . For fighting in order to demonstrate dominance is a well-documented animal function . Thus our ancestors required only the slightest of generalization by way of stimulus substitution to accept the // mere sight of a battered , losing contestant for the actual battle itself . The psychological reaction ? immediate , sudden , and usually unconscious ? is a favorable comparison of one 's own safe , comfortable self with the low estate of the unfortunate loser . This we might call superiority laughter , plain and simple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of defeat and ignominy , this reaction only one small step from the roar of triumph in actual battle , can certainly be considered " cruel ; " it can be called " inhuman , " it can be termed " callous " or " uncivilized . " It is the kind of behavior we wish our " nice " children to extinguish as quickly as possible , at least in public , lest our friends and acquaintances determine for themselves that we are raising " little monsters . " And yet : is the laugh of derision not , at the same time , a more civilized , a more couth form of behavior than its progenitor ? Is not the exercising of the archetypical tendency to strive for superiority ( and its culminating , satisfying bellow ) through laughter at the less fortunate more civilized , more sophisticated , and less savage than its physical counterpart ? Remember that , as noted in the last chapter , our ancient forbears at some time found it more comfortable and economical to live and hunt in groups , with established pecking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time came after man invented sharp hunting tools and developed greatly in brain size , thus making cooperative group hunting efforts more feasible than " going it alone . " 14 With this pecking order of superiority established , the amount of fighting was reduced considerably . But the need-to-laugh groove was by this time well-worn into the " shadow archetype " of the collective human unconscious . So , just let a member of the village , tribe , or clan wind up with a black eye or a broken nose as a result of picking a fight with the wrong guy ? and he will wind up a laughingstock to his brethren , who will demonstrate their unbattered superiority with horselaughs . It is just one more small generalization through stimulus substitution from laughing at someone **37;0;TOOLONG to laughing at anyone , anywhere , who appears in any way inferior at all . Thus the tribe 's permanent cripple , or the vil58 From Primordial Battle to Joke lage idiot , or the inept spear thrower becomes the perfect object of laughter ; so does the female so ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavewife who can not cook filet of tapir without burning it ; and ditto for the male suitor spurned by all eligible maids . And woe be unto the unfortunate in the tribe born with nose too long , or eyes too crossed , with hands and feet too large or without the proper number of digits . Gradually , through generalization , man learned to exercise his laughter archetype any time he encountered anyone substantially different , and therefore " inferior , " to himself . It is not hard to imagine the reactions when a roving band of pygmies encounters a hunting party of Watusi-sized sevenfooters ; the pygmies would probably squeal with glee as they derisively point fingers of scorn and ridicule at the gangling string-beans . And the giants would loudly cackle at the shrimpish stature of the small-fry . And the groove would wear deeper in the archetype . If superiority laughter is an immediate and direct descendant of primordial man 's roar of triumph in battle , we should expect to find it around today ? and we can , quite easily . The tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inferior ) person is far too general to require much documentation . I simply ask you to recall how many times in the last week you have laughed at someone who made an error of judgment or speech , dropped food in his lap , or dribbled Coca Cola down his chin . How many antics of slapstick comedy have you enjoyed ? Have you perhaps gotten off a horselaugh at a team ( or player on a team ) just defeated by your own " home " team ? Did you perhaps guffaw at any mistakes made by your opponents in that game ? How many slurs demeaning a race or nationality have evoked chuckles from you ? Our natural tendency to laugh at the misfit , the inferior , is evident in the way entertainers capitalize upon it . Thus Martha Ray has made a good living off her larger-than-average mouth , Buster Keaton built a career on a frozen , bug-eyed face , Jimmy Durante made it on little more than a bulbous nose , and Roscoe Ates , comedian of another era , made his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our forebears generalized from victory roar to the superiority laughter of ridicule . Then what ? // Well , somewhere along the line , we are not sure when , man ( or what we think evolved into man ) developed language . We do n't know exactly how he developed language ? there are a dozen or so theories of that alone . But we can certainly figure out why he developed language , and we can be pretty sure of some of the consequences of his new ability to talk . He learned to talk , after sufficient brain development , because it was a more economical way to do a lot of things . And , as one result of his new symbol-using ability , he was able to timebind . That is , he became able to consider , not just the here and now , but also the past and the future , and the far away . And he could use this time-binding ability to diversify his ridicule immensely . Now he can dredge up to consciousness ridiculous events of the past , the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ridiculous to occur within his immediate range of perception . With language he can serve up ridicule on demand ; he can engage in direct ridicule . Let us exemplify : One day Snof sees Gligf drop his crude stone axe on his toes ; Snof giggles gleefully at the stream of epithets and oaths which erupt from the pained Gligf . Superiority laughter , pure and simple . But several days later , while the tribal males are enjoying an evening aperitif of basted bison blood or some such , around the communal campfire , Snof describes in detail Gligf 's accident and the welter of cussing he has sprayed upward to the Gods , all to the hearty amusement of the assemblage . Language made man able , not only to recall past events , but able to discuss and predict future events ? and to ridicule his fellow man for the what-can-be . " You 're gon na marry Gerta ? You 'll be sorry . Marriage is an investment , certainly , but you can be sure Gerta 's mother will put in her two cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were going to a bridal shower you 'd probably want to take the soap . " Lastly , language allows faults to be immensely magnified and intensified ; and the faults of those ridiculed need not be physically present , but can be geographically far removed , even abstract enough to be unnamed . He is so stupid he has to go out of his mind to get an idea . // She 's so fat you ca n't see her double chin because her lip hides it . Is she skinny ? I 've seen more meat on a butcher 's apron . He is such a grouch that even his shadow wo n't accompany him . She is so plain that she would have to go topless just to become a wallflower . The development of language ( and other symbol systems ) thus allows primeval man to engage in deliberate ridicule . He need not wait for the accident of fate to deliver to him some inferior , thus laughable , companion . He needs no jester , clown , or dwarf constantly present . He can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exaggerate , at any time , a peer 's shortcomings , injuries , mistakes , and peculiarities . He needs no longer to be in direct proximity , in time or space , to someone less fortunate than he . He can verbally call up an inferior at will . Or , if he is mentally unable to verbally produce his own objects of derision , he can seek out that man ( or , less often , woman ) who has the facility for doing so . And so we have a built-in cultural need for a tribe wit ; the role of the jester is born . Today we call him a comedian or a humorist or a satirist . Needing the medicine of laughter , wishing to bare our teeth and chuckle at the deliberate ridicule of others , we go to our newspaper , magazine , television set , or nightclub . And we find in these channels deliberate ridicule heaped upon a large nu nber of persons , places , actions , organizations , institutions , and so on . Of course , as mentioned earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitution . This activity is made possible by language , alone , too ? and results in a great deal of deliberate ridicule of one group by another . In one of his daily newspaper columns Sydney Harris15 points out that man has always , apparently , ridiculed his neighboring groups by using them as symbols for stupidity , laziness , guile , or dishonesty . He mentions that , where he vacations , Polish jokes existed long before they became popular nationwide ? but that up there in Wisconsin they were Belgian jokes " by virtue of a large immigrant Belgian community which provided the butt of this rustic humor . " He adds : Thus has it ever been . There is no record of any culture anywhere that did not release its hostilities and exhibit its // invincible sense of superiority by deriding or down-grading some convenient out-group . Harris cites many examples from the world 's languages , using as his source Mario Pei 's The Story of Language . Among them : The earliest Slays called the neighboring Germans " Nemets , " which means " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , the word " slaves " comes from Slays who were captured in battle . In France syphilis is called " the English disease ; " in England it is called " the French disease . " The English invented the term " to Welsh , " a term meaning to renege on an obligation and thus an insult to the Welsh people . The English expressions " Dutch treat " and " Dutch courage " suggest that the Hollanders are tight with money and fond of alcohol . The expression " to Jew down " favors Christian charity , at the expense of Jewish greed . Both the French and Italians call a " confidence game " " the American swindle . " The French call the driver of a getaway car l'Americain . In German , the term " Russian " also means " barbarous " ; " English education " means " flogging . " The supposition that deliberate ridicule must have occurred very early in the evolution of humor in the race of man is suggested by its place in the evolution of the child 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's developing sense of humor and presents a case for deliberate ridicule as a very early development in the child.lb The very first stage , in children up to about three , is not very important , according to Harms . It involves laughter " in direct response to any pleasing approach , " or " humor as pleasure . " This could be construed to mean something very akin to superiority laughter . But let us go on to the second stage found by Harms : Humor as Funniness or Curiosity . Harms ' basic method is to get the preschool ( age three to seven ) child to " draw something funny . " He reports that children this age eagerly fall to the task and draw what , to them , is funny . What is it they draw ? We frequently find it curious to see what is funny to the // child . Practically anything unusual has the effect of amusing him . What he calls a " funny face " or a " funny man " is often quite the opposite to us . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an old woman , the abnormal size of a nose or limb , or the grimace of pain ? cause for pity in adults ? are causes for merriment in the very young italics mine . Harms elaborates by giving some examples : From a study of a large number of such funny drawings made by the three-to-seven-year-old group , we learn that humor is aroused in them by practically anything strange and unusual . . . . There appears a picture of the maid who has a toothache , the mother who is " mad , " a man who has a nose " like an elephant , " . . . A child calls himself funny when he has a black eye or a bandage because of a sore on the head . A dog drawn with too long a neck is as funny as a bird with four legs . . . it is funny to take a penny from the mother 's purse , or to break a dinner plate because one does not want to eat the meal italics mine . And so , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the children three to seven almost invariably draw something that could be interpreted as deliberate ridicule . The tendency to deliberately ridicule must be an absolutely inherent factor in the makeup of small children . And one more of its symbolizations will be noted , one that will be instantly recognizable to any observant person who hF 3 spent any amount of time around small kids . I refer to a little song , nay , a chant , into which one or more children will burst the moment he or they perceive that one of their companions is in need of ridicule . There is a great deal of rancor in it , and it is often accompanied with facial grimaces , nods of the head , and appropriate gestures . It invariably is delivered in an unpleasant , nasal voice , and goes : figure One might be tempted to conclude that this derisive chant is native only to a particular area , such as the United States . But a friend of mine , a professor of Germanic and Slavic languages // and a native of Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ridiculing children in each of the large number of European countries he has visited . What about later developments ? Harms ' study of the humor in drawings of children after they mature to school age shows that their humor becomes more situation-bound . The dominant element is still deliberate ridicule , but it becomes situational instead of merely expressionistic . Our experiments confirm . . . that we may generalize and say that there is no longer any laughing about a fat woman as such ; it is rather about comical situations in which she may be involved , as in passing through a small gate or trying to protect herself with an umbrella too small for her . It is not so much a stupid expression on the face of a country boy that is laughed at , as some incongruous sight of him ? as seeing him in his farm clothes walking barefoot down Fifth Avenue in New York City . Or it is the father dressed up like a baby , an ugly man studying his own face in a mirror , a conventional waiter forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head leading on a leash a dog with her head . . . . Rarely do we find in this period traces of humor of verbal character italics mine . The last sentence above is deliberately italicized . It is to again remind that the expression of this preadolescent ridicule is pictorial and quite nonverbal . It is not until later , at the onset of adolescence , that Harms ' subjects still drew pictures of " funny " situations , but generally would add a line or two of caption to underline the ridiculous point . A few examples may be given . There is the usual family group of adults , pictured fighting like a wild gang , and a caption is added : " Children must play . " A frail little boy stands before the platform with an old-maid teacher asking him , " Johnny , what is your father ? " and Johnny answers , " He was a teacher , but now he works really . " Purely verbal humor develops later . With the middle of the second decade of life , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third- and fourth-year high-school students have developed intellectually to such an extent that they // prefer to read humorous stories and to tell instead of paint them . Let us pull together some strands of thought by way of a summary . It is hypothesized here that man 's many generations of enjoyment of victory roars wore into the collective unconscious of man an archetype , a groove predilecting him to seek feelings of superiority . This archetype led him to generalize from actual victory over an actual opponent to unconscious victory over any fellow defeated by anyone else . This unconscious feeling of victoriousness generalized to fruition in any perception of any kind of difference in others ( ugliness , lameness , stupidity , etc . ) . As man developed language and other forms of verbalizations , he found that he could deliberately ridicule his fellows . Such a progression can also be found in the child . He begins with only a built-in tendency ( the archetype ) to smile and laugh at physical pleasure ( superiority to a former , nonpleasure state ) from contacts and approaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ugly and unusual become funny ( inferior ) to him . He is able to deliberately pictorialize the abnormalities he finds " funny . " Later he prefers his ridicule in verbal form . It would seem that " ontogeny does recapitulate phylogeny , " 17 at least where the development of the sense of humor is concerned . Before we venture down ( The " What Is . . . " Way ) , two more steps must be covered down the Ridicule Road . The first of these is the development of " affectionate ridicule . " The child who chants our " Yah ya ya ya yah yah " at his playmate is not being very " affectionate . " He wants the butt of the chant to feel sorely the humiliation of defeat or defect . He , is taking his superiority feelings straight . He has not yet learned the more gentle , more civilized art of affectionate ridicule , of " kidding . " What is the trick of " kidding , " the technique , the rationale ? Really very simple . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , and to feel and enjoy it . But he wishes not to enrage or overly humiliate his object ; he wishes the butt of his jibes to remain in good spirits , to " brush off " the ridicule , to show he can " take it , " to be a " good sport . " It will // help the " kidder " to achieve his goal if he , himself , will good-naturedly smile . " Smile when you say that , Podner , " translated , means : " Prove with your face that you do n't really mean it . " Thus a black woman can smilingly admonish her husband , " You big black Nigger , " and get maybe a kiss from her spouse ; but Whitey undoubtedly would get an entirely different response from saying the same thing , especially if said with a straight face . Dick Gregory can jokingly claim that he chose the title of his book , Nigger , deliberately , since he could then send one to the President or-the United States and claim he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' in the White House ! " The fraternity man can have fun ( feel superiority ) by joshing his buddy about the homeliness of his latest blind date without losing that chum 's friendship . And what happens if the " kiddee " becomes angry at the " kidder " ? Kidding , after all , does backfire sometimes . Kidding can go too far , or can be misunderstood . What if the one being kidded explodes in anger ? Why , the " kidder " dons the mask of innocence , smiles , displays the openhanded gesture of helplessness , and replies , " Oh , come on , ca n't you see I 'm only kidding ? " He might add : " Ca n't you take a little joke ? " Or : " Come on ? I thought you were a better sport than that ! " So , most of us learn to kid and to be kidded . We recognize the smile of the kidder , we notice his playful demeanor as he warms up on us . And we know that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good sports , " to not take offense . We learn the social , playful , " harmless " nature of kidding . We learn the myriad lists of discrepancies and faults and faux pas that can cause us to get kidded , and we learn to try to avoid these . For , we may not mind being kidded occasionally , but a steady diet of it grows irksome . We thus learn the customs , mores , and taboos of our culture ? which is another way of saying that we become " civilized . " From the victorious bellow of superiority over zonking an opponent into unconsciousness to the polite kidding that goes on at bridge table and cocktail party is a very long road , indeed . For mankind it has been a road of many thousands of generations , and for an individual man it spans the immense physical and psychological distance from the cradle to social maturity . It is only natural , of course , for " kidding " to have become so // much a part of the short prose narrative we call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more folks huddle to " enjoy a good one " together , they take on the smile , the conspiratory playfulness , the friendly closeness of the kidder and the kiddee . The only difference is who it is that gets kidded ? for it is usually some third party not present . To illustrate : you walk up to your colleague while at work . " Did you hear the one about the guy who came home to his nagging wife after playing poker all night ? " you say . Your colleague smiles , glances quickly around , and perhaps leans slightly toward you in the classic pose of the coconspirator . His facial expression of playful eagerness to hear the joke plainly means he has not heard it . " Well , " you say , " the minute he walks in the door , she takes after him with the nagging . He holds up his hand , says , ' That 'll be enough of that . Pack your bags . I just lost you in a poker game . ' Stunned , she blurts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was n't easy , ' he replies . ' I had to fold with a royal flush ! ' " Shared laughter . But why the shared laughter ? The two of you laugh with the poker-playing husband ( the kidder ) and at the deflated wife ( the kiddee ) . In order to enjoy this little episode the mantle of reality must be suspended , temporarily . Men just do not put up their wives as stakes in poker games ; and , even if they did , what poker player would accept a nagging , unpleasant woman as stakes to play for ? Thus the conspiratorial playfulness is a prerequisite . The stereotypical " nagging housewife " has gotten her comeuppance within the socially acceptable framework of playful banter . How much more civilized than punching your own better half in the mouth ! So we have seen how our triumphal scream of victory in battle has evolved , phylogenetically as well as ontogenetically , to the " harmless " kidding of social repartee and the joke . Let us now turn to a second evolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What is . . . . " Way As the most primitive of human societies began to take shape , and the amount of " victory roaring " was decimated by the recognition by everyone of " his place " in the pyramidical // hierarchy based upon strength , the inherent need to exercise the " laughing groove " worn into the collective unconscious by generations of triumphant bellows was satisfied in a way significantly different from that of the Ridicule Road . Signs of apparent defeat and accident , and physical and social abnormalities continued to evoke laughter in the increasingly civilized creatures we assume were our ancestors . But another kind of laughter , one based upon actual conflict and its successful resolution , must surely have emerged as our bettle-browed ancestors grew larger and larger brain cavities , and filled them with larger and larger masses of cortical matter . It may not have happened just this way , but then again , it just might have . Two members of the tribe , a little brighter but considerably weaker physically ( and perhaps less brave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another , the one with the chance to win ( and therefore laugh in victory ) , and the other to taste the bitter dregs of defeat ( the penalty for grabbing for the brass ring of victory and missing ) . But : they do not intend to fight ; they will compete with their wits ! They will match intellects . As in the primordial physical battle , the basic pattern with the exact same factors prevails . Each contestant places great store on the contest and its outcome . Each strives mightily to win , for to lose is painful . Clock poses a question to Clunk . Clunk sweats and ponders in his attempt to come up with the answer to Clock 's question , while Clock anxiously hopes that his supposedly mental inferior has no chance to dredge up the answer . When he feels assured of victory , Clock perhaps even poses the inevitable , " Give up , do you Clunk ? " Clunk wearily nods , whereupon Clock triumphantly announces the answer and guffaws his superiority for anyone in earshot to perceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any cohorts of his hang their heads in sympathy at the defeat , but Clock 's friends join him in victorious laughter . Again , we have had , as with the roar of triumph in the actual , physical combat , the two factors : ( a ) an intense duel , with great tension developing in each combatant , and ( b ) a sudden victory of one over the other resulting in glee for the winner and gloom for the loser . // How can we be sure it happened this way , or even in some way remotely like this ? We can not , of course . But we can assume , from historical evidence , that men did take contests involving duels of wit quite seriously , and that these duels , in the form of the riddle , were quite ancient . As reported in Encyclopedia Britannica : Riddle stories too began in time out of mind , for the enjoyment of puzzles is as old as humanity itself . But there is a practical utility in puzzle solving , also , that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as necessary for the brain as for the body.18 The oldest known record of the riddle in literature comes to us from the Bible ( Judg 14 : 12-18 ) , in which Samson wagers thirty sheets and thirty changes of garments that the Philistines can not answer the riddle , " Out of the eater came forth meat , and out of the strong came forth sweetness . " When the Philistines were able to get Samson 's wife to wheedle from him the answer ( involving a swarm of bees and honey within the lion 's carcass ) , it so angered Samson to be so defeated that he slew thirty men to allay his anger ( and to secure thirty changes of clothing lost in the gambit ) . Although this riddle is the oldest extant , it is probably notthe oldest absolutely . The riddle of Samson , propounded in the Bible ( Judg. 14 : 12-18 ) , is the most famous early example ; but , although Samson has been called the father of riddles , it may be that older and better ones were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzling was a religious rite , and the Sphinx was their goddess . Such was the esoteric religion of the Egyptians that all the priests were riddlers and their religion one vast enigma . The classic riddle of the Sphinx , however , belongs to Grecian mythology . Its date is not authenticated , but it is of antiquity , for Sophocles wrote about it in the 4th century , B.C.19 This example of the Sphinx , incidentally , is the one which Rapp uses to substantiate the claim that the wit-duel inherent in the riddle was both taken as a very serious matter and that its history is ancient.20 In case you have forgotten , the Sphinx was // a legendary monster who sat upon a rock on the roadway to Thebes ; to every wayfarer she posed the riddle : It goes on four legs in the morning , two legs at noon , and three legs in the evening . What is it ? All contenders lost and were subsequently murdered by the Sphinx , until the famous King Oedipus correctly answered the riddle ( Man : he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upright in the noontime of life , and with the aid of a cane , or third leg in the evening time of life ) . Defeat at the hands of Oedipus so enraged the Sphinx that she committed suicide by hurling herself from the rock . Each of these most serious consequences of losing in a riddle contest ( murder and/or suicide ) , says Rapp , may be " indirect evidence of the day when these wit contests were taken as seriously as physical struggles . " 21 I must concur that such reactions to losing at riddling are somewhat extreme . It seems quite plausible and likely to me that duels of wits in ancient times probably were staged for audiences . I can conceive a situation in which the official top intellect of Tribe A challenges his like number from Tribe B to a contest of grey matter , the loser to forfeit , say , a pig or a goat . The time and place are set ; announcements are made throughout the ranks of both tribes ; perhaps even side bets are laid between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins , the fans from Tribe A sit on the side of their hero , while those of Tribe B glare across at them from behind their champion . As each combatant scores a " point , " his laughter is accompanied by that of his following . At the conclusion of the contest , the contestant with the most points walks off with his opponent 's pig , or goat , smiling and laughing , accepting the congratulatory whoops of his supporters . It is not even difficult to imagine one side 's becoming so bitter in defeat that they begin an actual knock-down , drag-out brawl in order to wipe the victorious smirks from the faces of their vanquishers . Well , then , let us agree that the riddle was ( and is , among the young ) a contest taken very seriously and one which probably sprang from the deep-seated yearning for combat in order to exercise the laughter response . Generations of such riddling and riddle contests must have preceded the next development ; // 1 but , as man developed a more and more complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually occur . One of our hoary ancestors must have combined the riddle form with a word with double meaning , thus inventing the conundrum or punning riddle . What 's the best way to keep a fish from smelling ? Cut off his nose ! Rapp suggests , and I concur , that the first wily riddler to crack a conundrum such as that above probably got a bust in the mouth from his defeated opponent . Why ? Because the victim of this " riddle " had not only been " defeated , " but he had been tricked and duped , as well . He thought he had been asked the question end of a " real " riddle . What is the best way to keep a fish from smelling , he ponders . He struggles at reviewing all he has learned about fish and their smells during his lifetime ; he considers various proposals , such as salting it , cooking it , soaking it in brine , and drying it in the sun . During the time allotted to his answering the " riddle " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are turned down by the " riddler . " Finally , he gives up . " What is the best way to keep a fish from smelling ? " he asks , realizing that , at least , if he has the answer , he can pull the riddle on his dumb cousin . The riddler bares his teeth , rises to his full height , and answers : " Cut off his nose ! " This answer does not immediately solve the problem for our puzzled loser of the riddle contest . For a brief instant he thinks , " cutting off a fish 's nose does not stop it from ? smelling ? Hmmmm . " Deep thought . " Smelling . Doing it , not causing it . By damn , I have been tricked ! " And the riddler gets a shot to the proboscis . ( Punch in the nose . ) But physical abuse could not stop the wave of potential conundrum artists . The desire to demonstrate man 's versatility with his more and more complicated linguistic repertoire had to outweigh the danger of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conundrumming . What linguistically gifted savage could resist the urge to demonstrate his verbal agility with a repertoire of conundrums as : How does a married man differ from a widower ? One kisses the Mrs. and the other misses the kisses . // How does a flea differ from an elephant ? An elephant can have fleas , but a flea can not have elephants . Who was the first man to bear arms ? Adam . What has four legs and flies ? A dead horse . When is a horse not a horse ? When he turns into a barn . Shortly after the conundrum appeared on the scene , however , its victims probably grew to recognize its relatively harmless nature . Certainly , there is still a protagonist ( the riddler ) and an antagonist ( the loser in the contest ) . But losing to a conundrum is not the same as losing to a straight riddle . To be sure , the loser has been outsmarted , but double meaning was used ! He could not really be expected to know that the riddler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a most important change in the evolution of human humor . There has been a great dampening of the direct animosity , the aggressive competition , between the protagonist and the antagonist . The contest nature of the riddle has been lessened , has become more indirect . The riddle has turned from a " real " contest of brains to a " play " contest more like a game than a fight . The " winner " is not the more wise and the " loser " the more dense ; it is simply that the " winner " was aware of the double meaning and the " loser " was not . The " duel " turns not upon wisdom and knowledge of the real world , but upon nonsensical symbolic manipulation of the " unreal . " We must note here three other highly important features of the conundrum which differentiate it from the " real " riddle ; these three features further detract from the " contest " nature of the riddle and add to the " game " nature of " adult " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening gambit of the conundrum usually identifies it immediately as a conundrum , that is , as a game and not a real contest of gray matter . The wording of the question end of the conundrum places a " play frame " around the wit-producing incident , which , human beings quickly learn , marks it as " harmless " conundrumming and not as a serious challenge to the intellect . Note the following examples : Why is a woman in the bathtub like a devout Christian ? // When is a cow not a cow ? What happens when you throw a rock into the Red Sea ? What is lonely , sexy , and hums ? How could any reasonably intelligent person mistake these questions as asking for anything but relatively nonsensical plays upon words ? Second , the antagonist becomes a willing " victim " of the conundrum when , recognizing the " play frame " of the opening question , he realizes that , once he has endured this minor and insignificant " defeat , " he can play the verbal superior over the next chum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . He hears his friend ask , " When is a cow not a cow ? " Aha ! A conundrum is coming , he perceives , and his interest perks . He asks , " When ? " , vaguely realizing but accepting the fact that he is going to suffer an infinitesimal loss of self-esteem but , at the same moment , realizing he may remember this " good one " to pull on the gang at the office later . The momentary and infinitesimal drop in self-esteem , upon hearing the punch line ( " When she 's turned into a pasture " ) is what produces his usual response to the conundrum : an audible groan , not a laugh , often accompanied by deprecatory facial expressions and gestures . But now he can hardly wait to find a colleague who has not heard " when a cow is not a cow . " The third feature differentiating the conundrum from the " real " riddle is the emotional reaction upon hearing and comprehending the answer . In the " real " riddle , the emotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of loss . But in the conundrum , the emotion is likely to be positive , one of success , or victory . There is a brief instant of incQmprehensibility , of mystery . There is the feeling that " that ca n't be right . " One must briefly mull over the answer , sorting through his verbal repertoire and his past experience to see how the answer " fits . " Then it dawns upon him ; he has " figured it out . " He has been able to " win " over himself while being mildly " defeated " by his protagonist . And if he can not " figure out " the conundrum , if he can not experience this " victory " over his original puzzlement , he is unable to appreciate the conundrum or to feel the slight // pang of momentary defeat which produces the " groan of recognition " which usually follows conundrums . To illustrate this last feature ( and the is a mirror like a philosopher ? " Immediately Mr. B recognizes some sort of figurative analogy based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can exist between . a flesh-and-blood person like a philosopher and a cold , hard glass object called a mirror ? " ) , and he gets set for " play . " Mr. B. , never having thought of such a comparison before , now perhaps considers these two objects briefly , trying to see if he can come up with an actual or nonsensically analogous similarity between them . He does not bother his head long , however , because he knows it is some sort of absurdity that is to be the answer . He " gives up , " now eager for the answer so that he can pull this one on his wife or on Uncle Charley . He gets the answer : " Because it reflects . " Almost immediately he recognizes the schizophrenic character of the word reflect ( 1 . To give back an image or likeness of ; mirror 2 . Careful thought ; deliberation ) . He recognizes that mirrors and philosophers reflect , each in an individual way . He groans at his small , absurd " defeat , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets home or to the office . Of course , if Mr. B does not experience his little victory , if he does not do the successful remembering and connecting of the two meanings of " reflect , " the humor of the situation is lost . He is likely to respond with , " What do you mean , A , that it reflects ? A mirror ca n't think at all , much less think carefully ! " From the conundrum , or punning riddle , of course , it is only the smallest of steps to the pun . For it is no more than a punning riddle , or conundrum , turned into a one-liner . One example which Esar provides , for instance , is , " The first thing that strikes a stranger in New York is a big car . " In riddle form it would be , " What is the first thing that strikes a stranger in New York ? A big car . " " Many a blonde dyes by her own hand , " can be converted to , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " " If you are too busy to laugh , you are too busy , " can become , " What are you if you are too busy to laugh , " etc . The pun is merely a clever verbalism , and the punster is // demonstrating his verbal cleverness ( superiority ) . Who is the antagonist , the " butt " of the pun ? The listener ? the person or persons to whom the punster is demonstrating this cleverness . And what is the appropriate response to the pun ? As with the punning riddle , a groan , not a laugh , is expected . In the pun , the contest nature of the event diminishes further ; the listener was not " set up " for defeat by a question ? instead , the speaker simply made a clever statement which employs at least one word that can have two or more meanings ( he usually intends the less usual meaning ) . To the listener , the statement makes little sense ; he ponders , however briefly , over the seemingly irrelevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of the punster . Then he " gets it , " feels the eureka ! response of success ( which is pleasurable ) , but at the very same time realizes that he has been the victim of verbal trickery by a ( temporarily ) linguistic superior . Yech ! This development through our generations of ancestors from roar of triumph to duels of wits through riddles through punning riddles to the pun is not as important a development to our modern wit and humor as is the development of ridicule . I repeat here that there is some ridicule in every humorous incident , whether it be affectionate or not ; but there is not always the punning element . However , the modern " joke " is a highly complicated affair , and might contain several elements of both ridicule and punning . The matron at the concert whispers to her husband , " My , does n't that contralto have a large repertoire ? " " Yes , " her husband agrees , " and that dress she 's wearing just makes it look worse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains several possible causes for laughter . First , we may be amused at our superiority over the husband , for he certainly has not only demonstrated his stupidity , but has revealed a mind dwelling on something other than High Culture . We probably respond to the chagrin his wife feels to hear her oaf of a husband make such a stupid and low-life mistake ; we may even be able to imagine her being embarrassed at the thought that others seated around them have just discovered what a gutter-minded loser she picked for a // husband . And then , the acceptance of the unfamiliar word , " repertoire , " as a probable euphemism for a portion of the anattomy has a punning quality to it , a play on words . And this mistaken acceptance causes " sex to rear its ugly ( and incongruous ) head " in the midst of this refined cultural event , a laughable incident in itself . Well , what proof is there that our victory roar evolved into the pun via this route ? Admittedly , there is very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may be mush more difficult to ' believe that the triumphal roar evolved first into the riddle , and thence to the punning riddle ; but the pun must certainly have come from the conundrum . And we can look to the evidence of ontogeny for proof that the punning or " joking " riddle is the very earliest of verbal humor that children engage in . Martha Wolfenstein has made a detailed study of the humor preferences of small children of various ages.22 She is a keen observer , and a patient and thorough interviewer . Let us see how she describes the verbal humor preferences she observes in the six- to eleven-year-old child : The joking riddle is the favorite form of joke for children between the ages of six and eleven . The child who asks the riddle shows how smart he is , for when the other can not guess , he gives the answer himself . . . . Children at this age are peculiarly preoccupied with the issue of who is smart and who is dumb . They are especially sensitive to being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows . When a child has been outwitted or outdone by another , one hears the heartfelt cry : " You think you 're smart ! " Any advantage is apt to be felt as smartness , any disadvantage as dumbness . This preoccupation is reflected in the favored jokes of children of this age . The riddle form stresses the issue of who knows and who does n't . . . . With striking punctuality children seem to acquire a store of joking riddles at the age of six . Children younger than six are not " ready " for punning riddles ; but as noted earlier in the Harms study , they go for the humor they can find in grotesqueness ( ridicule ) as Wolfenstein shows : When I tried to teach joking riddles to five-year-old children , they seemed to find them meaningless . I asked Nora , the five-year-old girl who had made up the funny story about the cat that got thrown out the window : " Do you // know why the moron threw the butter out the window ? " As she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To see the butterfly . " She smiled slightly but , I felt , without comprehension . I explained that it was a joke . Nora said : " My brother knows those but I do n't . " ( Nora 's brother is eleven . ) When I asked if she knew any other jokes like that , she said : " I 'll show you on a piece of paper . " She proceeded to draw and told me : " See , a man got so funny he fell in the water and a whale swallowed him . . . . Here 's the man and here 's the whale . " Pointing to the whale : " Here 's eyes and two noses . No , here 's an eye and a nose and an eye and a nose . No , one eye . " She laughed ... . Note the similarity of delight in the grotesque , above , with Harms ' findings , reported earlier . Unfortunately , although Wolfenstein 's credentials as an observer and an interviewer seem nearly faultless , her analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is badly flawed by her psychoanalytic training ? she is misled by large dollops of Freudian rot . She insists , for instance , that the answer to the harmless riddle , " What has four legs and ca n't walk ? " ( A table ) represents " a couple in intercourse " ( Rabelais ' " beast with two backs " ) . Let us consider her analysis of the two riddles , Q. What has holes but holds water ? A. A sponge . Q. What is a lady always looking for but hoping not to find ? A. A hole in her stocking . She claims that the first of the above suggests that , even though the female has a vagina instead of a penis , she is nevertheless able to control her water ; the second , she says , expresses that a woman always hopes to find that she has a penis , but finds a vagina ( hole ) instead . One more example of her Freudian ( sexual ) interpretation of all joking : Q. Why did the moron jump off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smash hit on Broadway . How does she explain liking for that one ? The huge phallic shape is the father 's penis , the sight of // which impels the child to competitive exhibition . He hopes to have a sensational success , but also fears a catastrophic defeat . Unable to abandon his ambitions , he pays in advance . The reader by now must assume that I hold no brief for such Freudian analysis of humor . Wolfenstein 's book is recommended reading , nevertheless . But expect a murky psychoanalytic interpretation for every little superiority tendency . Wolfenstein does not go to great lengths to typify the kind of humor preferred by older youths , although she points out that they tend to " outgrow " conundrums ? with one exception : when adolescents get into a " silly mood " they apparently delight in returning to these childish ways . However , we have seen in the Harms ' study , above , that the high school youngster graduates to the point where he much prefers verbal humor , presumably with at least some " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stresses that the humorous jokes of adolescents differ only in degree , not in kind , from those of adults . This last conclusion of Wolfenstein , supported by the Harms ' study of laughter development in children , finds a remarkable parallel in a study of laughter of children in another country , Spain.23 This Spanish study also tends to confirm the general kind of humor development in children as is suggested here in humor development in the race of man . An English translation in abstract form24 adequately summarizes the study : Examines the development of laughter in children from 0-14 yr. old and concludes that , contrary to psychoanalytic theories , a child is able to laugh at a very early age ( 2 mo . ) . As the child develops , the stimuli for laughter gradually multiply until , at the age of 10 , he acquires an understanding of that which is comical . His laugh reaches full maturity at 14 , at which point he is able to appreciate humor . Any type of laugh that can be observed thereafter in an adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mean that those situations which cause a child to laugh will produce the same effect in an adult . It is suggested that the best stimuli for laughs are always those situations that are particular to the age and last functional or intellectual achievement of the moment . Thus any stimulus that brings about a child 's laugh has its parallel in an adult . It is proposed that such parallel situations be searched and out78 From Primordial Battle to Joke lined whereby the causes and types and laughs can be studied . A study conducted in England on the sense of humor in children seven to ten , eleven to thirteen , and fourteen to eighteen revealed remarkably similar results . Development of the sense of humour was found to run parallel with general intellectual and emotional development . Deviations from the normal and conventional were outstanding causes of laughter in the youngest group . Incidents involving someone 's discomfiture ( which were also - popular in the youngest group ) were those most frequently referred to by the children in the second group . The humour of both these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Distinguishing features of the adolescents in the third group were : ( a ) the marked individual differences in their sense of humour ? although many no longer tolerated slapstick farce and preferred witty and realistic comedy , others enjoyed both , and others , again , gave as their best jokes fatuities that were popular among children in the youngest group ; similarly , although several relegated the laugh of Hobbes ' " sudden glory " to an inferior category , many gave first place to humour of this type ; ( h ) their much greater appreciation of verbal wit ; ( c ) the tendency of the majority to reflect on why they laugh , and of a minority ( especially among the girls ) to deprecate laughter that is unfeeling.25 Rapp and I may both err in describing what I call " The What Is . . . " Way , the evolution of triumphal roar to pun by way of several steps ; but it is clear that something of the sort must have actually occurred . Unless punning developed from an ancestor common with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it becomes necessary to imagine two ( at least ) phylogenetic developments , one for " humor " ( ridicule ) and one for " wit " ( punning ) . Such a possibility must be rejected as highly improbable . C. The " Constrain Yourself " Course We now come to the third and last important developmental factor in our quest to understand laughter 's evolution . Rapp called this development " suppression laughter " and granted it the status of a separate developmental direction or " leg . " By granting the " Constrain Yourself " Course a separate section in // this chapter , I seem to follow his logic , although I must demur from actual agreement with him . Let us see how Rapp describes " suppression laughter : " This . . . we may call suppressive laughter , or , more fully , the laughter of victory over one 's repressor . That this exists , as an added and therefore separate factor , may be suspected from the following items . If a boy is watching the skaters at a rink and someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it should happen to be his Latin teacher that is much funnier . If a stranger 's hat should blow off as he is crossing the street , many uninhibited persons would be amused . But if it were the local policeman , they would find it hilarious . At army maneuvers , even if your buddy should trip and land face down in the mud , you would laugh . But if it could only be your sergeant ! In all the preceding examples there is provoked the laughter of ridicule ; but in some there is a definite additional layer of laughter which requires investigation . . . . This suppressive laughter also appears in cases where it seems directed not against constraining persons , but against legal , religious , and social institutions.ze There can be absolutely no doubt that the enjoyment of ridicule is heightened when the object of the ridicule is some person or institution toward which we have had to constrain our true feelings . Rapp 's examples above can be multiplied over and over . In wartime Germany , for instance , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his henchmen ; but jokes about them flourished in an underground sort of way ? and there can be no doubt that they were enjoyed hugely in lieu of the constraint placed upon outright anti-Nazi criticism . Herman Goering 's taste for gaudy medal-bedecked uniforms was well-known ; this led to some wag 's coining of a word , the " Goer " ? this was defined as the maximum amount of tin a man could carry on his chest without falling flat on his face . Goebbels , Hitler 's propaganda chief , gave rise to the coining of the " Goeb " ; this was the least unit of energy needed to cause listeners to switch off 100,000 radio receivers . Goebbels ' nickname became " Mahatma Propagandhi . " As the war turned sour for Germany , conditions were ridiculed . A would-be suicide buys rope with which to hang himself , but it is of such poor quality that it breaks . He tries to drown himself in the // river , but the wood fibers in his ersatz clothing keep him afloat . He gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after four weeks on normal rations.27 In the fifties the following was reported to be popular in Hungary : A schoolteacher asked ten-year-old Istvan to compose a sentence containing a dependent clause . " Our cat had ten kittens , " said Istvan , " Of which all were Communists . " " Excellent , " said the teacher . " Exactly right . Be sure you do as well next week when the Government supervisors come . " The following week she asked the prize student the same question . " Our cat , " said Istvan , " had ten kittens , of which all were Social Democrats . " " Why , Istvan , " cried the teacher , " that 's absurd . That 's not what you said last week . Last week your kittens were all Communists . " " I know , " said Istvan , " but since then their eyes have opened . " 28 How can one doubt that constraint born of suppression would increase one 's enjoyment of such jokes . As Richard Hanser puts it : If the joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sufficient blast at the prevailing system , if it jabs sharply enough under the skin of bureaucrat or Gauleiter or commissar , it will be repeated with relish and listened to with satisfaction regardless of age or previous condition of servitude.29 The principle underlying suppression laughter is probably greatly responsible for the fact that we find jokes on our enemies to be more highly enjoyable than jokes upon ourselves , our friends , or our own reference groups . There are at least two psychological studies that show that Republicans enjoy anti-Democrat jokes better than anti-Republican jokes , and Democrats enjoy more highly anti-Republican jokes than anti-Democrat jokes.30 Of course , the fact that Republicans can enjoy anti-Republican jokes and Democrats can enjoy antiDemocrat jokes at all is a sign that we can become quite civilized about not taking reference group membership " too seriously . " Fanatical members of a group or adherents of a belief , of course , can find nothing at all funny about the organization or belief in // which they vest their fanaticism . Thus they reveal their mental imbalance . As Sydney Harris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fanatic with a sense of humor ; fanatics repel us not so much by their passionate devotion to a cause as by their incapacity ever to laugh at themselves or at their idees fixe , which is a deadly flaw in the human animal.31 Rapp concludes that suppression laughter makes up one of three separate " families " of laughter , the others being ridicule and wit . On this point I tend to disagree with him ; my position is that there can be none of what he calls suppression laughter without first the presence of wit andlor ridicule . That laughter is heightened by the fact that the person or institution ridiculed or defeated in the witwork is one toward which the one laughing has had to constrain hostile emotions does not , to me , make suppression laughter a separate family . The authoritarian position of the institution or person " defeated " merely spices up the laughter that would be produced without the authoritarian status . This is actually a small point of difference in opinion , but one worth noting . Now then . Do children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " show signs of what Rapp calls " suppression laughter . " No one who has spent much time around small children can doubt that , at least after a certain age , children absolutely delight in catching adults in mistakes . What reader of this book can not remember , as a child , listening to and retelling the most outlandish stories about his parents andlor teachers , or perhaps grade school principal ? Who does not remember the childishly immature but devastatingly satiric names made up for the more repressive of his grade school teachers ? The many taboos which we begin to place upon the growing child cause resentment and constraint , also , which are released often in laughter of suppression . As Katharine Kappas puts it : The humor of these children nine-year-olds may also reveal some hostility and aggression , for , not only do they enjoy behavior or situations of which adults disapprove and sometimes delight in the misfortunes of others , but they also find amusement in deviations from the normal and conventional . The expression of taboo subjects in82 From Primordial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child matures , and the joking forms of the nine-year-old show this.32 Now , before going to a graphical representation of the theory which the last two chapters have explained , let us once again look at the modern " joke " or funny story . Many can be seen to contain each of the three elements of our phylogenetic theory : ridicule , wit ( plays on words ) , and suppression laughter . The Reader 's Digest quotes Louis Azariel 's story about Charles Coburn , the actor , as it appeared in the Baltimore NewsPost . Coburn 's story : As a boy , I fell in love with the theater and started seeing plays whenever possible . " One thing , Son , you must never do , " my father warned . " Do n't go to burlesque houses . " I , of course , asked why . " Because you would see things you should n't , " Father replied . That settled it . The next time I managed to get the price of admission , I went straight to a burlesque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't have seen ? my father . Let us analyze . Father has been caught in an indiscretion . Ridicule . The oppressive father-figure , the " Censor , " is overturned . Our rejoicing with the triumphant son is heightened by the authority of the deposed . Suppression laughter . And there is the double meaning of " something you should n't see " ( meaning female anatomy ) and " something you should n't see " ( your father at the peep show ) . Not all three elements are present in all modern jokes , but the point here is that these three elements often do combine to produce a highly " complicated " funny story . Now , by way of summary , let us look at a schematic block diagram of how humor developed . As pointed out early in Chapter 2 , a theory , such as a theory of humor and laughter , need not be true or false ; a theory , instead is usually considered relatively useful or not useful . We can not leave the theory of laughter presented in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with that of other , competing theories . As also stated early in Chapter 2 , a theory 's usefulness is assessed relative to its explanatory comprehensiveness ; that is , on how figure // well it succeeds in providing an explanation for all the phenomena it purports to explain . In the case of a theory of laughter and humor , it ought to be useful for explaining all laughter and laughter-provoking situations . Since 1955 I have heard countless thousands of jokes , read countless thousands more , and seen innumerable cartoons , whimsical and heavily political alike ; I have consumed large numbers of satirical pieces by Art Buchwald , Art Hoppe , Dick West , Mad , and National Lampoon . I have laughed long and often at such as Grin and Bear It , Pogo , Peanuts , and Li ' 1 Abner . I have even gone to the trouble to perform formal content analysis on magazine cartoons for graduate-level term papers while pursuing the Ph.D . degree . And I have yet to find a laughter-provoking event that can not be explained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many people find uncomfortable a belief that laughter and humor , such pleasant , desirable aspects of a full life , must rest upon a solid basis of superiority . As a result of my research , I occasionally get invited to speak to various groups on the nature of humor . During the question period following my explanation of what I consider to be the basis of humor , there are always argumentative questions . Disappointed audience members tell their favorite jokes and ask how these can possibly be based upon superiority . As a result of a syndicated newspaper article on my views I have become engaged in debates via mail with such disparate individuals as a proctologist in Wichita Falls , Texas , and a housewife in Green Bay , Wisconsin . In each case I have been able to stifle objections with the force of logic and dogged willingness to persist in expending the hot air or keeping the electric typewriter going until resistance disappears . But I suspect that the disappearance of resistance very often has signified fatigue and not acceptance of this " superiority-evolutionary " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation . The problem and its solution are aptly put by Harvey Mindness , whose delightful book Laughter and Liberation33 should be required reading : The spirit of humor demands that we acknowledge , in spite of our need for love , our undeniable lust , and in spite of our // capacity for caring , our inclination to not give a good goddamn . We are reluctant to make these acknowledgments because they clash with our image of ourselves as good people . A good person , we rightly believe , is characterized by unselfishness , concern for others , and a real ability to love . Humor , however , is not allied to goodness ; it is allied to nature and to wholeness . To allow our sense of humor its full development , we must be willing to shift our primary aim from the attempt to be good to the attempt to be natural . As I constantly explain to audiences and to interested correspondents , part of the so-called human condition is a natural , inborn tendency to want to compete successfully ; and also : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost completely unconscious . And , it must be remembered : much of our appreciation of humor which we might label as " whimsy " is based upon victimless superiority . It is this point that can become a sore point of contention and a roadblock to understanding andlor appreciation of the " superiority " or " degradation " theory . Let me explain with an example . Mindness , mentioned above , agrees with the assumption that there is a great deal of degradation which is responsible for laughter . However , he subsumes jokes which are funny as a result of degrading someone or some group under his " liberation " theory which , briefly , proposes that the most fundamental , most important function of humor is its power to release us from the many inhibitions and restrictions under which we live our daily lives.34 After giving several examples of degradation humor , Mindness presents two items of " nonsense humor " which , he claims , can not be explained in degradation terms : Q : What is purple , weighs ten tons , and is found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : How can you tell if there 's an elephant in your refrigerator ? A : You 'll find his footprints in the cheesecake . // Mindness would claim that these bits of foolishness are funny because they give us " Freedom from Reality , " ( his fifth " chapter " ) and allow us to delight in childish , lighthearted nonsense . But I think each is eminently explainable by the theory I have outlined . First , let us consider our ten-ton purple sea dweller . Who is he ? Moby Plum . First , let me ask : Suppose you had never heard of Herman Melville 's gigantic symbol of evil incarnate ? Suppose that , faced with the task of identifying Moby Dick in a newspaper quiz you had to guess that this was slang for a certain rank of policeman ? If you were this ignorant , would you laugh , even smile at " Moby Plum " ? Of course not . You would more likely shake your head in bewilderment . But : you have read Melville 's classic ; or you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen the movie , starring Gregory Peck as Captain Ahab . And when you hear that Moby Plum is something purple , weighing ten tons , and lives in the sea , you see the " natural " connection , the logic of it all , crazy though it is in reality . You succeed at the cognitive task thrust at you ; and you applaud yourself with the chuckle or smile of self-satisfaction ! And how do elephant footprints in the cheesecake fit our theory ? The same mechanism applies . Certainly , if any animal is hiding in the refrigerator one would probably find his tracks in the cheesecake ! Sheer " logic . " And an elephant could hardly avoid stepping in the stuff ! The reasoning is crystal clear to the quick-witted . Of course , one might argue another way : anyone who would offer such as a clue to an elephant 's presence in a refrigerator must be a little loose in the flue . No trouble feeling superior to him . I might say in passing , that Mindness argues that his " liberation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would argue that the theory which I propose is " degradation-plus , " meaning it includes the smile or laugh which comes , via generalization , to symbolize self-satisfaction through verbal problem-solving . And , although I could argue that my theory subsumes and encompasses Mindness ' liberation theory within it , I really sha n't bother . He and I agree far more than we do not . Besides , I think you should read his book , also . // Also , Mindness ' theory , to my thinking , fulfills the requirement that a theory must possess explanatory comprehensiveness more than most other , competing theories . There is no doubt that humor today in adult , civilized society provides the individual liberation from " conformity , inferiority , morality , reason , language , naivete , redundancy , seriousness , and egotism . " I just happen to think the theory provided here which I support does a better job of explaining how laughter came to be such a liberating force . I hope that psychoanalytic theories were properly enough disposed of in Chapter 2 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that was completely victimless but for which Freud himself was unable to supply a single example . Bergler 's neo-Freudian explanation of laughter as evidence of pseudo-aggression spawned by our inborn drive to live out our lives as " psychic masochists " has , I hope , been dismissed as utter nonsense . Theories such as Eastman 's which propose one set of behaviors and neural mechanisms for one kind of laughter and another set for another kind of laughter must also be rejected as useless for describing and explaining the whole spectrum of human laughter . Other theorists , on the assumption that no one theory can encompass all humor-provoking events , have proposed " minitheories " which profess a logical consistency of their own but do not propose to comprehensively explain all laughter . Such a minitheory is proposed by Jerry Suls.35 He makes a good case for the perception of incongruity as the touchstone of humor ; but the examples he uses to support his case are far more explainable using simple superiority or ridicule . For instance he cites the joke about " Fat Ethel " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the lunch counter and ordered a whole fruit cake . " Shall I cut it into four or eight pieces ? " asked the waitress . " Four , " said Ethel . " I 'm on a diet . " Certainly it is " incongruous " of Ethel to order a whole fruit cake and then , at the same time , fool herself to believe that by having it cut into only four instead of eight pieces she will somehow // save herself some calories . According to the theory which I hold to , the joke is intrinsically funny because Ethel suddenly and simultaneously reveals herself to be both gluttonous and stupid . Remove her stupidity and we have no way to feel suddenly superior to Ethel ; she is no longer funny . Suppose she had said : " Well , I 'm going to eat the whole thing anyway , so it does n't matter ; but cut it in four pieces , and maybe I can rationalize to myself in some way that I really am eating less . " We can not feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and it has not been revealed suddenly . Perhaps it is because Suls ' explanation is not the only explanation of this joke that causes editors Paul McGhee and Jeffrey Goldstein to label Suls ' work a theory of comprehension and not appreciation of humorous stimuli.36 Certainly , . humorous stimuli must be understood to be appreciated ; but an explanation of understanding is not an explanation of appreciation . All of which brings me to the question most asked by my live audiences after a lecture on " what makes humor funny . " If superiority is the reason for laughter , Professor , why can we laugh at ourselves ? That is , how can one feel superior to one 's own self ? My answer is two-fold . First , we can laugh as a result of successfully achieving what was a puzzle formerly . For instance , I compare my checkbook bank balance against my monthly statement and find that the Citizens and Southern Bank believes that I have $13.97 more in the account than I had calculated . My consternation rises as I check and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resubtract . Suddenly , just as I am about to conclude that the bank 's computer contains a weak transistor , I find that an outstanding check for $13.97 has been left out of the calculations . I chuckle a little , partly out of relief ( and laughing does provide physiological relief ! ) , but also partly at how stupid I had been just moments ago ! Second , one of our separate selves can laugh in superiority over the other . One self laugh at another ? How can that be ? Each human being is really a collection of several human beings . I , myself , for instance , am a college professor , a husband , a father , a blood donor , a scoutmaster , a researcher , a friend , etc. , and , on occasion , I regress to the " little boy " me that // lurks in every mature man . As Shakespeare said , a man plays many roles in his life . And one role can delight in seeing the other taken down a peg or two through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that professors can be dull , absentminded , and removed from reality . But when I hear that " A college professor is a guy who has lost touch with reality by degrees , " it is the little boy , the " playful me , " that smiles at the professor 's comeuppance . Most mature adults realize the welter of conflicting cognitions and emotions which they must constantly balance off against each other . When one is caught exercising one of the more " base " or least socially acceptable cognitions or emotions , the less base or more socially acceptable cognition or emotion laughs in superiority . For example : I believe strongly in being a true-blue husband and upright model for my children . But , like any man alive , I have an archetype of promiscuity inherited from ' way back , and so when my wife catches me staring , openmouthed , at the coed mincing past in short-short cut-off jeans , my upstanding " moral " self enjoys itself by laughing at the expense of my " lecherous " self . And if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday afternoon in July instead of watching the bikinis at the pool , my " lecherous " self smiles in conspirational glee at the " stupidity " of my " work ethic . " That part of me that is lazy occasionally gets off a laugh " at my serious , occasional bursts of work ; likewise , my ambitious self often gets a chuckle at my laziness . My humble self occasionally gets to laugh at my proud self , and vice versa . And is it not this ability of one part of ourselves to laugh at another that keeps us sane , that keeps us healthy , that keeps our many and various roles in balance ? Is not the man with " no sense of humor " the man with fewer and more rigid roles or selves in his behavioral repertoire ? Is he not a flat , unidimensional man , one who can see nothing funny about himself or his beliefs ? In short , is he not " out of balance ? " Not only do I feel that the theory presented in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since it purportedly can provide a logical explanation for any laughter-provoking incident , but I feel that it is therefore the most verifiable . In the case of the present theory , one would be // compelled to predict that as a part of any humorous event one would necessarily have to find a victim , no matter how obscure that victim might be , and one must find the element of suddenness in the victim 's loss or " unmasking . " During over twenty years ' research in humor , I have been unable to find a humorous event that could not be found to contain these two indispensable elements . In addition to the superiority I feel my theory enjoys in its explanatory comprehensiveness and its verifiability , I believe it to be more preferred for its parsimony , its simplicity . Although it takes considerable time and energy to explain how the mirth experience came about through phylogeny , it is really a simple proposition to say : " In any humorous situation find an element of superiority that has been perceived suddenly . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one needs a definition of " suddenness . " There is no necessity to link this humor theory with physiological data recorded by complicated electronic gear ; it must not match a personality theory in which the ego mediates between the id and reality and , in turn , is dominated by the superego ; it requires no acceptance of a septet of unproven baby fears or assumptions that a mother 's smile instinctively means to a baby that she will not devour the infant ; it does not require that we have a rash of conflicting minitheories in order to explain apparently disparate forms of humor and laughter ; and it does not necessitate a separate neural subsystem for operating the laugh of scorn and another for the laugh of play . The very simplicity of this theory makes it superior to others in preventing " the observer from being dazzled by the full-blown complexity of natural or concrete events , " the fourth criterion of a good theory . And it is this simplicity which makes it ideal for demonstrating an understanding of the differences and likenesses between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken up in the next chapter . 5 Humor and Wit The early pages of Chapter 1 point out the great overlapping of various terms suggested to designate categories of humor . Even the encyclopedic attempt of Evan Esar to classify the various types of humor was found to be wanting . Much of the difficulty in classifying anything so diverse and rich in meaning as what it is that makes people laugh lies in the fact that language and its use among men are not as scientifically specific or universally concise as , say the formula E = MC2 . For words do not " possess " meaning , but are only useful as they " stir up " meaning in the nervous systems of people who use them . Lewis Carroll , in Chapter 6 of his Through the Looking-Glass , exemplified and , for his comic purposes , exaggerated this tru-ism : Humpty-Dumpty said : " There 's glory for you . " " I do n't know what you mean by ' glory , ' " Alice said . HumptyDumpty smiled contemptuously . " Of course you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , There 's a nice knock-down argument for you . ' " " But ' glory ' does n't mean ' a nice knock-down argument , ' " Alice objected . " When I use a word , " HumptyDumpty said in a rather scornful tone , " it means just what I choose it to mean , neither more nor less . " In this chapter we shall be concerned with developing a 91 // clearer understanding of two terms that have often been carelessly used and sloppily defined ? two terms that refer to two different yet related concepts : " wit " and " humor . " Albert Rapp has clearly spotlighted the problem : What is the difference between wit and humor ? Nearly every writer on wit and humor in the last one hundred years has thrown a friendly tackle at this elusive broken field runner . Some few of these , for a brief instant , have laid eager fingers on some palpable area . But it always finally escaped them ; and today it is commonly agreed that the question has not been answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor " is used about half the time to mean " wit and humor , " and often is used to mean simply " wit , " as when referring to joke books . For instance , Nancy Levi Arnez and Clara B. Anthony entitled an article , " Contemporary Negro Humor as Social Satire . " 2 Since " satire " is generally considered a type of " wit , " they seem to carelessly classify humor as a type of wit . The same problem of ambiguity plagues our use of the term , " sense of humor . " Well , if you enjoy funny stories . . . , if you enjoy wit generally , if you are quick at catching the point , if you can occasionally do a little active verbal sabering of your own , you may be fairly said to have a good sense of wit . Or , as people will more likely put it : " sense of humor " . For the term " sense of humor " is used today , colloquially , to cover two substantially different things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor ( more strictly ) . These often appear together , as do ham and eggs.3 The problem is one of lack of suitable and applicable definitions : One of the most persistent and exasperating phenomena in the whole field of wit and humor is precisely this : when you have worked out a fairly adequate explanation for wit , it makes no sense in connection with ridicule ; if it makes sense in ridicule , it does n't seem to apply to genial humor ; and the things you might be tempted to say about genial humor do not seem to bear any relation whatsoever to riddle laughter . And yet they must all be related , for laughter is one.4 // Vivian Mercier suggests that , as judges and lawyers can agree on the " relevance " of a particular item of evidence although they might fail to agree on a definition of " relevance , " and , although our major networks can differentiate between specific programs as either " information " or " editorial , " " without agreement upon definitions for each concept , the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor " " : Like most people who have enough education to make the distinction , I just assume that I can tell at a glance whether a remark is witty or humorous . Probably nine out of ten of my off-the-cuff judgments would be accepted by the average reader of this article . But if he and I tried to produce mutually acceptable definitions of " wit " and " humor " , we 'd soon become imbedded in a semantic morass.5 The " semantic morass " might very well dissipate somewhat if more people had , as does Mercier , a knowledge of how these two words , " wit " and " humor " developed historically in the English language . As he points out , " ' wit ' was once synonymous with ' intellect , ' while ' humor ' can to this day mean ' temperament ' or ' mood . ' " h In fact , a brief look at the history of these two words can be quite edifying . The most comprehensive and scholarly work of lexicography executed upon the English language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original sources of a particular word , but where the words were first printed as denoting particular intended meanings . " Wit , " which claims parentage from several primitive languages , including Old English , Old Frisian , Old High German , and Old Norse , originally meant : " 1 . The seat of consciousness or thought , the mind ; sometimes connoting one of its functions , as memory or attention . " The word with this now obsolete meaning has been traced to about the year 1000 . An even earlier use of the word to mean , " The faculty of thinking and reasoning in general ; mental capacity , understanding , intellect , reason , " appeared in Beowulf about the year 589 A.D. By 1325 the word " wit " could be used to mean , " Practical talent or cleverness ; constructive or mechanical ability ; ingenuity , skill . " By 1579 the word " wit " was being used to mean , " Quickness of intellect or liveliness of fancy , with capac94 Humor and Wit ity of apt expression ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amusing way . " By 1642 it was used to mean , " That quality of speech or writing which consists in the apt association of thought and expression , calculated to surprise and delight by its unexpectedness . . . later always with reference to the utterance of brilliant or sparkling things in an amusing way " . By 1692 the word was used as a noun to refer to " A person of lively fancy , who has the faculty of saying smart or brilliant things , not always so as to amuse italics mine ; a witty person . " On the other hand , we find that " humor " has its ancestry in the Anglo-French ( h ) umour , and is found to have been used earliest in 1475 as meaning " mental disposition " or " temperament . " By 1525 it is used to denote , " Temporary state of mind or feeling ; mood , temper . " It is not until 1682 that the word is found to be used in the sense of , " That quality of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oddity , jocularity , facetiousness , comicality , fun , " and , " The faculty of perceiving what is ludicrous or amusing , or of expressing it in speech , writing , or other composition ; jocose imagination or treatment of a subject . " An Oxford note appended to these definitions reads : " Distinguished from wit as being less purely intellectual , and as having a sympathetic quality in virtue of which it often becomes allied to pathos . " So it can be seen that " wit " is historically associated with " intellect " while " humor " is linked with the concept of the more " emotional " activity of feeling . This distinction is the one " theory " of the difference between wit and humor that is most often stated by writers in the field . However , this distinction tends to break down if one considers the act of laughing to be primarily emotional rather than intellectual . For if a " witty " remark elicits the emotional response of laughter , how can it be " purely " intel-lectual ? Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thought in the Oxford English Dictionary appended to the last definition of " wit , " above . As Mercier points out , " humor " . . . " connotes kindliness , geniality , sometimes even pathos " in its expression " and a reaction of sympathetic amusement from the audience , " whereas " wit " is f // associated with " quick , sharp , spontaneous , often sarcastic remarks . " ? But this distinction is not strictly logical , either . Says Mercier , lit sounds plausible enough until the next time one has occasion to use the phrase " macabre humor ; " where are " kindliness , geniality . . . pathos " to be found in that ? There is such a thing as macabre wit , of course , but I should n't call the typical Charles Addams joke witty . And most of the new " sick " jokes I would classify as humor , either macabre or grotesque . The dictionary 's theory may be of some use in discussing British humor , but it seems quite inadequate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just plain American comic material which is definitely not witty and just as emphatically not genial.8 One difficulty inherent in producing a completely logical distinction between wit and humor is the usual lack of pureness in most examples of either . Seldom is one dealing with pure humor or pure wit . Some element of wit or wordplay is the occasion for much playful and friendly humor . And much wit relies for its effect upon ridicule , friendly or not , which , my thesis argues , is the foundation and immediate ancestor of " playful " humor . The rest of this discussion , therefore , is based upon the theoretical idea that relatively pure wit and relatively pure humor is its proper subject . Being dissatisfied with both the " intellectual/emotional " and the " sarcastic/kindly " dichotomies used to explain the difference between wit and humor , and demonstrating a thoroughness and depth of scholarship into humor , ' Mercier has developed his own theory of how wit differs from humor . By permission of the Nation magazine I quote extensively from his article in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of its acceptance . Oversimplified , Mercier 's Hypothesis would run like this : " Wit is always absurd and true , humor absurd and untrue . " ( Irony , similarly defined , is plausible and untrue . ) In other words , paradox is basic to wit . When an Oscar Wilde character says , " A cynic is a man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing , " the remark momentarily sounds contradictory and therefore nonsensical ; then we discriminate between the synonyms " price " and " value " and see the point . This kind of discrimination // requires an intellectual effort unnecessary to the appreciation of humor and also produces the element of surprise which Addison thought essential to wit . Irony , in the basic sense of saying one thing and meaning another , demands an even more complex intellectual response than wit does : wit confronts us with a patent absurdity and asks that we make sense of it , whereas really subtle irony can easily be mistaken for the literal truth . Humor , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My dictionary defines " absurd " as " clearly untrue or unreasonable , and therefore laughable , ridiculous , " etc . In actual fact , alas , the unreasonable is often far from being untrue , but for humorous purposes the two become identical . Sometimes we would prefer to describe a humorous remark as exaggerated rather than untrue , but , as any fisherman will admit , exaggeration is the commonest form of lying . The typical response of someone with a poor sense of humor to a joking remark is , " Surely that ca n't be true ? " Take the story of the three hermits , the Gaelic of which suggests that it was current before 1200 A.D. ( for all I know , it may occur in Latin or Sanskrit , too ) : after they had been living in the wilderness for a year , one of them said , " It 's a good life we have here ; " after another year , the second replied , " Good , indeed ; " after a further year , the third said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going back to civilization . " On the face of it , this story is untrue ; the third hermit 's remark is patently unreasonable , too ; still , one could argue that the story is true to the spirit of the ascetic life , which it merely exaggerates to an incredible degree ; viewed from any of these three standpoints , the humor of the story still raises the issue of truth and falsehood , or at any rate of credibility . I must admit that denying the truth of humor implies a challenge to some powerful adversaries . According to the genealogy supplied by Addison , Truth was the greatgrandfather and Good Sense the grandfather of Humor ; this makes a bastard of Irish Humor , which has nothing of Good Sense in its composition . According to Max Eastman , both Aristophanes and Charlie Chaplin have insisted on their own truthfulness . In an interview with Eastrnan , Chaplin said of his audiences , " I make them conscious of life . ' You think this is it , do n't you ? ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is , see ? ' And then they laugh . " There is a grain of truth in the Chaplin view : the humorist does work with materials from life , but he usually heightens and exaggerates them to the point where they are just barely recognizable . Life is ugly and terrifying // at times , as we all know , but the whole point of macabre and grotesque humor is to present life as even more ugly and terrifying than in fact it is . Our laughter at such humor is in part motivated by a feeling of relief that things are n't , thank goodness , quite that bad . Maybe I 'm a Pollyanna , but I think this response accounts for the popularity of sick jokes more often than the release they give to feelings of repressed hostility . The humor typical of armies and boarding schools the world over depends on wild exaggeration of real hardships . . . . There is another fairly important distinction between wit and humor that the standard writers on the subject do n't pay enough attention to : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual ) than humor . I ca n't think of an uncaptioned cartoon or a sequence in a silent movie that one could fairly describe as witty . Furthermore , to deny that puns are witty or to describe them as the lowest form of wit seems to me completely wrongheaded . I doubt whether wit can exist without some kind of play on words . This is where I quarrel with Addison , who takes the usual dim view of the pun . To see if he lives up to his own program , let 's look at his example of a witty simile : " . . . when a Poet tells us that the Bosom of his Mistress is as white as Snow , there is no Wit in the Comparison ; but when he adds , with a sigh , that it is as cold too , it then grows into Wit . " To say that a bosom is as white as snow is n't witty , of course , because it lacks absurdity ; the statement is at once recognized as objectively verifiable . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can prove , if the poet andlor the mistress consents to the experiment , that her bosom is no colder than that of any other human being . Only when the metaphorical meanings of " bosom " ( " seat of the affections " ) and " cold " ( " unemotional " ) are considered does the poet 's absurd statement become " true " . Thus " bosom " and " cold " are puns ; the play on these two words makes an objectively absurd remark metaphorically true . Not all puns are witty , but perhaps all witty remarks are in this sense puns . . . . One final point : unconscious humor turns up every day in the behavior of people who take themselves very seriously , but can we also speak of unconscious wit ? Freud , if I understand him correctly , would say yes ; from his point of view even our dreams can be witty . Having laid so much stress on the intellectual nature of wit , I 'm not sure that I ought to agree with him . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show the same formal characteristics as deliberate witicisms . The so-called " Irish bull " at i // its best can be astonishingly witty . Sir Boyle Roche , a member of the Irish Parliament just before the Union with Great Britain in 1801 , gave utterance to several bulls that would have won any other man vast reputation as a wit . According to Sir Jonah Barrington , it was Sir Boyle who made this brilliant remark , in a debate on taxation : " I would ask the honorable gentleman . . . why we should put ourselves out of our way to do anything for posterity , for what has posterity done for us ? " Barrington tells us that Roche was puzzled by the laugh which followed this remark and tried to clarify matters , saying that " by posterity he did not at all mean our ancestors , but those who were to come immediately after them . " Obviously the second remark was so nonsensical a blunder as to be barely humorous , even , but the first contained a truth that has great appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contribution of real merit to furthering our understanding in this area . However , some niggling comments must be made before passing on to other considerations of the same topic . First of all , when Mercier states that " Wit is always absurd and true , humor absurd and untrue , " he is engaging in semantic paradox . The usual meaning of " absurd " is that specified by my dictionary : " Contrary to reason ; not agreeing with truth or common sense ; ridiculous . . . . " So , how can it be both " true " and " not agreeing with truth ? " And , is not the statement that what is " untrue " is also " absurd " a redundancy ? Of course , Mercier goes on to explain his position in enough detail to rebut the semantic argument : we know what he means , I think . However , he labels as an " untruth " simple exaggeration . And it seems to me that a great deal of exaggeration can appear in a witticism without allowing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is , for instance , the famous retort to a politician who predicted that his opponent would die either on the gallows or of a venereal disease : " That depends upon whether I embrace your principles or your mistress . " Is this not untrue , or at least exaggeration ? Is one to really believe that the angry recipient of this retort has principles that will inevitably lead to his hanging ? Are we actually to believe that he has a mistress ? And that she undubitably must have the disease in question ? I think that what Mercier really intends here is that " wit " // has a stronger grounding , on the average , in reality , than does what we would label " humor . " It is a matter of degree , not one of kind . Macabre and " sick " humor certainly must be taken as " untrue , " that is , not literally , if it is to be received as humor . This is the point I was making in Chapter 1 regarding the conversation between two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off a cliff . It must be " taken as a joke , " and not seriously , or it is not the least bit funny . It appears to be a major point , also , in William F. Fry , Jr . ' s book , Sweet Madness.ii We must have a " play frame " around our jokes in order to recognize the " untrue " nature of their content . Not only must Mercier 's " trueluntrue " difference between wit and humor be considered one of only degree and not of kind , so must , according to my thinking , be his " verbal/less verbal " . Certainly the vast majority of witty events are verbal ; of this there can be hardly any doubt . And certainly a great deal of humor can be entirely visual , without the slightest trace of plays upon words . Visual humor is much more akin to childish ( emotional ) play , while language is almost universally required for the more intellectual games of wit-work . But , contrary to Mercier 's assertion that he can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one could fairly describe as witty , " I think I can assert that I can . Quite often I have remarked to myself how a witty caricature in an uncaptioned political cartoon has visually carried the field in performing its satiric work . And can remember one devastatingly witty uncaptioned piece in Playboy . Playboy had been running a series ( one per month ) of wellknown classical works of art , rendered extremely faithful to the original ? but with one tiny , hard-to-detect detail altered . The one I remember most vividly was Grant Wood 's American Gothic . The dour-faced farmer and his wife stared out realistically from either side of his pitchfork ; the rendition of the barn in the background was painstakingly accurate to the original , as was each nuance of expression on the two faces . I searched and searched the picture , thinking at first that perhaps the printer had mistakenly left out the one " defect . " Finally a tiny red spot became evident on the bosom of the lady 's dress . Close scrutiny revealed that it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again , such visual wit is far less evident than is verbal wit ; // the purely visual stimuli for laughter can almost unanimously be called " humor " rather than wit . But there are exceptions . I agree wholeheartedly with Mercier that there can be such a thing as " unconscious humor " but that " unconscious wit " is impossible . However , I regret his theory 's incompleteness in that it leaves out consideration of what Albert Rapp and I consider an important dimension : that of aggression/kindliness . As mentioned before , Freud postulated that there is " tendency wit " ( aggressive ) and " harmless wit . " " Harmless wit " depended upon form , not upon a " victim . " Even though , as pointed out in Chapter 1 , Freud could not supply a single example of completely harmless ( victimless ) wit ( or , humor ) , there are laughter-evoking stimuli that can vary widely in the specificity of who or what is being attacked , and how strongly . Contrast Nietzsche 's mentioning " two great European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was flying in a plane from New York to California and suddenly the plane was hit by lightning . A little old man sitting opposite me screamed : " Do something religious ! " So I took up a collection . Rapp is another modern writer who has grappled meaningfully with the difference between " wit " and " humor , " or what he often calls " humorous laughter . " His stand , based as it is on the phylogenetic development of laughter in man , is generally quite agreeable to me.12 He makes five points in differentiating the two concepts . First , he insists that humorous laughter must be accompanied by a " predominate measure of affection or love , " for that is its nature . Descended as it has from what he calls " thrashing laughter " ( what I call " roar of triumph " ) to " ridicule " to " affectionate ridicule , " it contains more of the civilizing balm of human kindness . Wit , of course , may be openly hostile , although it need not be ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can agree with most of this first point , although I agree with Grotjahn that there can never be anything like a completely victimless laughter-provoking stimulus . Again , it must be a matter of degree . Certainly , there are jokes so mild that the victim seems so obscure as to be unrecognizable ; sometimes one must search diligently to find him . But as I hope I demonstrated // in the last chapter with the examples given by Mindness and Suls ( pp. 85-88 ) , one might suppose that sheer foolishness or simple incongruity alone could produce laughter , but that the humor can disappear like steam in the arctic without someone or something being demeaned at least somewhat . To illustrate how the love/aggression difference can operate , let us consider comedian Dick Gregory . During a nightclub performance he is likely to be heckled by drunk bigots in the audience . To these he can respond with any one or more of several hecklerisms I would personally classify as " wit , " and of the " aggressive " kind , such as Man , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain integration to a lynch mob ! Do n't just sit there and heckle me . Pay your check , burn your cross and leave ! He can be gentler , more kindly in what I would call " humorous " comments , too . At one public appearance he was questioned as to how he can demand respect and love of the white community when he talks about such deadly things as burning down our houses . He responds that he would " just make sure you were n't home at the time . " Even milder still , he will comment : People keep telling me some of their best friends are colored . Let 's face it , there just are n't that many of us to go around . . . . Personally , I like Negroes . I like them so much , I even had them for parents . . . . Joshing , self-ridicule , yes . But there is still the tinge of criticism of Whitey under the surface . Rapp 's second point is that wit is intellectual , a duel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even be verbal , but may exist as visual , slapstickish . In this respect Rapp agrees with both Mercier and me . Rapp 's third difference : " In humor it is nearly always clear who it is you are laughing at ( and with ) . In wit it is occasionally clear , but usually not . That is why , in wit , people often think they are laughing at a word or phrase or play on words Freud 's supposed ' harmless wit ' . . . . " My own position is that this distinction can be applied only partially . Certainly , many victims of puns do think they are laughing at " plays on words , " but // again : it depends upon the target of the pun . Generally , I should guess that when the target of the pun is oneself , one may have difficulty in consciously assessing himself as the direct antagonist . However , if the pun is a witty attack on someone else , the audience to the pun might easily detect the target of the aggression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where do you find mangoes ? Why , where woman goes ! " , you might ( if you even thought of it ) chalk up the " laugh " or groan to the " play on words " ; but when critic Irving Hoffman said about Ilka Chase 's performance in a play : " She makes me Ilka , " the audience can have little doubt as to who is the victim of the pun . Point number four , according to Rapp , is that wit is artificial and deliberate , whereas humor is more " natural " and spontaneous . The creator of wit , the person who tells a gag , or makes a witty comment , is deliberately creating , and showing his skill . Again , Rapp could get little argument on this point from Mercier or me . Rapp 's last point is one which the results of experimental psychological studies have validated . The witty person , therefore , tends to be characterized by vanity , narcissism , extroversion , intellectual skill , verbal skill , sadism , aggressiveness . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an affectionate attitude toward his fellows , by tolerance of sin and weakness , by sympathy with sufferers , by an objectivity of attitude , by patience , by masochism , by maturity . Since this chapter takes issue , however mildly , with the position which Rapp has taken , it is only fair to point out that he himself has pointed out that his stated differences between wit and humor are generalizations , " which is to say that they are not always necessarily true . " He is also fond of pointing out that humor and wit often are found in the same story , as in the example he provides : " I meant to have told you of that hole , " said an Irishman , to a friend who had fallen into a pit in the Irishman 's garden . " No matter , " said his friend . " I 've found it . " To repeat again , wit and humor , to my mind , differ only in // degree and not in kind . Humor generally carries more affection and love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more intellectual than is humor , in general ; in humor it is more often that one can tell who is being laughed at , andlor with , than in wit ? with some glaring exceptions . Wit tends to be more artificial and deliberate than does humor , although " humorists " deliberately invent and stage the display of their work . And " wits " tend to be more aggressive than the more gentle " humorists . " An understanding of the differences between wit and humor can be further understood by means of an extended analogy . The analogy is a comparison of the relationship between wit and humor as compared to that between rhetoric and poetic . It is probably quite true that very few ordinary citizens have bothered their heads over the differences between rhetoric ( defined by Aristotle as " the faculty of observing , in any given case , the available means of persuasion , " ) and poetic , meaning usually " literary discourse . " But the problem has been stimulating enough to foster a small but energetic scholarly literature.13 It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scholarly pursuit of the ways in which rhetoric differs from poetic , but merely to use those differences to develop further insight into the subject of wit and humor . For the better we understand humor , the better we can understand the tactics , rationale , and problems of much of the research explained in the next two chapters . In general , it will be argued that the differences between wit and humor are very much like the differences between rhetoric and poetic , that wit tends to be more like rhetoric , and humor tends to be more like poetic . The comparison will be specifically drawn between the wit/humor and rhetoric/poetic differences of ( 1 ) Purpose , ( 2 ) Medium , ( 3 ) Method , ( 4 ) Audience and Occasion , ( 5 ) and Subject Matter . Left unargued will be the question of which forms of the compared discourse types require the most " gift " or " genius . " For its definitive explication of the differences between rhetoric and poetic , this chapter selects that as presented by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Poetic Discourse . " 14 His analysis is generally supported by two // other important scholarly articles.15 Various sources will be cited to support the corresponding differences between wit and humor.16 Purpose For analytical clarity , purpose here is considered in two parts , function and motive . " Function " refers to what the particular mode of discourse is expected to accomplish ; " motive , " of course , refers to the intent , the raison d'dtre of the producer of the discourse . It is these two elements making up the purpose of a particular discourse that most clearly distinguish wit from humor and rhetoric from poetic . Let us first consider function . Function . As one might conclude from the simple definitions above , the proposed function of rhetoric is quite a practical one , whereas the function of poetic is aesthetic . As Bigelow puts it : In very brief terms , the distinctive Function of poetry is to give aesthetic pleasure rather than to persuade , to express or exhibit rather than to communicate . . . . Rhetoric may propose both to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuasion ; poetry may also propose both to please and persuade , but the emphasis is on pleasure.17 To illustrate : in his Inauguration Address ( rhetoric ) a U.S. President will generally attempt serious and important persuasive functions , such as a uniting of the people divided by the election , or to secure acceptance of his broad legislative program . But it would be an immensely modest speaker on this occasion who did not also attempt some flashes of vivid style that would please aesthetically enough to make his speech memorable . It is the style of rhetorical pieces and not simply the unadorned thought which has captured and retained the imagination of millions . Roosevelt 's " We have nothing to fear but fear itself , " and John Kennedy 's " Ask not what your country can do for you , but what you can do for your country ! " state simple ideas , but in language artful and graceful enough to conceal that art . By the same token , a poem , such as Housman 's " To An Athlete Dying Young , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its airy , " sweet " style ; it only secondarily makes a wry rhetorical point . // And what of the function of wit vs. the function of humor ? Edgar Johnson , in a definitive work on satire a species of the genus wit , discriminates between burlesque as satire and burlesque as humor : " When burlesque inflates things to grotesqueness just for fun italics mine , it is one of the forms of humor ; when it inflates them in order to deflate them it is satire . " 18 Johnson further denies the label " satire " to any laughterprovoking stimulus which attempts to achieve no serious func-tion : No description of satire can hold water unless it takes all aspects of satire into account . . . . The one ingredient common to all . . . from satire in cap-and-bells to satire with a flaming sword , is criticism.19 Gilbert Highet generally upholds this distinction advanced by Johnson : The purpose of comedy and farce is to cause painless undestructive laughter at human weakness and incongruities . The purpose of satire is , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marie Collins Swabey agrees that irony ( another form of wit ) , as well as satire , proposes to persuade through criticism : Closely related to irony is another variety of the comic involving adverse criticism known as satire . To ridicule the vices and follies of mankind is the business of satire . . satire by its imaginative eloquence excites anger at human misdeeds and cruelties.21 Persuasion is also the usual proposed function of most " serious " ( that is , political andlor otherwise satirical ) cartoons . As the late Edmund Duffy , whose cartoons have been described as " more effective than a well-aimed brick , " put it once , " The best cartoons are against something . " 22 There can be little doubt , for instance , that the heavy-browed , unshaven likenesses of Richard Nixon drawn by editorial cartoonist Herblock were designed to lower our estimate of Nixon . As the creator of Pogo , Walt Kelly , has emphasized : " Cartoonists are subversive . . . . They are against things . " 23 Occasionally the ability to employ witticisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's adversary . Stephen A. Douglas was supposed to have feared Abraham Lincoln 's wit . When he heard that the Illinois Railsplitter was to be his political opponent , Douglas is reported to have said of Abe : " I shall have my hands full . He is the strong man of the party ? full of wit , facts , dates , and the best stump speaker with his droll ways and dry jokes . " 24 And wit is occasionally given credit for accomplishing the function for which it was designed . Thomas Dewey 's failure to achieve the Presidency has been partially attributed to a comment by Alice Longworth , who described Dewey as resembling " the bridegroom on the wedding cake . " 25 Richard Nixon 's 1960 bid for the Presidency , it has been widely felt , was thwarted at least in part by a witty comparison : " Would you buy a used car from this man ? " The French satirist Voltaire " probably had more influence on society than any other Western satirist , " probably because " he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 26 However , as we shall see in the next chapter , the overall persuasive function of satire has probably been grossly overestimated . Of course , it can not be said that the only , or even the most , important function of wit is persuasion or aggression . Like humor , whose primary goal is entertainment , the various forms of wit are also designed to elicit pleasure . As Leonard Feinberg says of satire : The chief effect of satire is pleasure . That pleasure may consist of relief from dullness , as in Charlie Chaplin 's definition . " Slapstick is a break in the monotony of normal conduct . " It may be relief from " the tyranny of reason , " as Schopenhauer suggested . Or , in Freud 's view , it may be relief from authority . Satire offers the consolation of superiority , which is useful even if it is ephemeral ; for many people even a momentary feeling of superiority is rare . Satire may also provide a fresh perspective , detachment , or balance . But essentially it offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that rhetoric 's primary function is to persuade , but may also please aesthetically ; poetic 's primary function is to please aesthetically , but may also serve to persuade . And wit may function to both persuade or chastise and please ; humor is more strictly aimed at pleasure . // Motive . Rhetoric and poetic generally differ in how consistent the motive behind each remains to its function . The rhetorician 's motive is usually highly consistent with the function of his discourse , whereas the user of poetic discourse may have a motive not at all in keeping with his work 's primary function . As Bigelow explains , In poetic discourse , moreover , motive may be relatively independent of the function . One strong component of the poet 's motive is simply that the discourse shall be , without much reference to what it shall do.28 The motive of the political candidate on the campaign trail is to secure votes , the intended function of his rhetoric ; the poet might produce a dazzling array of images which function to thrill the aesthetic sensibilities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce an enduring work of art . One 's motive for telling " a good one " at the shop or office is usually quite consistent with the function of the joke itself ? to entertain . But the jokester may also have other , less consistent motives in sharing his jokes . He may find this a productive way to " kill time " that would otherwise hang heavy over his head ; he might seek to increase his popularity with his fellow workers ; if there are females present , and the jokes he tells tend toward the scatalogical or the obscene , his motive may be aggression , even seduction , toward the females.29 On the professional level , the motive of the comedian can be quite disparate from his function of entertaining . He performs his act to make people laugh , certainly ; but he seeks to make his living at it , also . A quest for fame would not be inconceivable . In rhetoric , of course , the rhetorician 's motive would usually be quite consistent with the persuasive function of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive differ between wit and humor , but the actual motivation behind the two forms usually differs . Whatever his other motives , the purveyor of humor hopes to entertain ; but the motive for wit is usually more " serious . " The story is told that William Jennings Bryan , finding no platform to speak from at a country meeting , climbed onto a manure spreader and proclaimed : " Ladies and // gentlemen ! This is the first time I have addressed an audience from a Republican platform . " Quite obviously , the Great Commoner had a political point to make in addition to his hopes of getting a guffaw from his audience . Much the same kind of double motivation was probably behind Emory Storrs ' statement that " the Democratic party is like a mule ? without pride of ancestry or hope of posterity . " Producers of the wit-form known as satire have " serious " motives , also . As Highet puts it : the motives of the satirist ? . . . First , he is always moved by personal hatred , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second impulse is openly avowed by many satirists . They wish to stigmatize crime or ridicule folly , and thus aid in diminishing or removing it.30 " The laughter of comedy is relatively purposeless , " David Worcester chimes in . " The laughter of satire is directed toward an end . " 31 Therefore , as rhetoric differs from poetic in seriousness and practicality of function and motive , so does wit differ from humor in overall purpose . Medium Rhetoric deals with reality , with real events , proposing solutions to real problems and praising or blaming real people and institutions ; poetic is more apt to deal in fancy . The language of rhetoric focuses the attention of its audience upon the world as it is , but the more figurative language of poetic is more apt to fly into the imaginative . On this contrast Bigelow quotes Longinus ' " On the Sublime : " It is no doubt true that those images found in the poets contain , as I said , a tendency to exaggeration in the way of the fabulous and that they transcend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best feature is always its reality and truth.32 The same distinction can be said to exist between wit and other comic forms . We have already seen , above , Mercier 's insistence that it is the relative truth or falsity between wit and humor that distinguishes them ( " Wit is always absurd and true , humor absurd and untrue " ) . Other experts agree , such as // Feinberg who wrote : " Significant satire is concerned with the nature of reality . " 33 Two comments from Johnson : For satiric purposes . . . abuse has to be damaging , and to be damaging it must strike us as really true . The sudden revelation of a damaging truth is what makes comedy wit italics mine . . . . Even comic satire derives its significance from the truth.31 But wit has its eye glued on reality . . . . Its theme is always reality ; its standards are truth and sanity . . . it is a true instrument of satire . . . wit is not necessarily amusing . Serious wit may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insistence that the wittiest of humor represents " truth or sense " comes from Cecil Northcott . He even goes so far as to entitle his brief article , " I Just Tell the Truth , " from the assertion by Mort Sahl.36 Sahl , one of the more outspoken and satiric of the so-called " New wave " comedians , thus describes what he does . He does not " tell jokes , " but rather , capsulizes and condenses truth in a " kind of shorthand . " Consistent with his claim is the fact that a typical prop in his nightclub monologue is a rolled-up newspaper . And regarding satire , playwright Gore Vidal concurs : " . . . for is not satire , simply , truth grinning in a solemn canting world ? " 37 Method The difference between the method of rhetoric and poetic is one already mentioned as existing between wit and humor : the method of rhetoric is more reasonable , appealing more often and more directly to the intellect ; the method of poetic is imaginative , emotional . As Bigelow explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progression of ideas determined by reason and appealing chiefly to reason in the hearer . . . the method of poetry is alogical , dependent upon emotions rather than on reason . . . poetic discourse is essentially alogical . . . appealing to imagination or emotion.38 Johnson asserts pretty much the same difference between wit and humor : // Humor remains closer to the childhood mood of hilarity than wit does . Humor may be sheer playful nonsense . It is indifferent to whether its fun is anchored in reality or adrift in fantasy . It is high-hearted and cockeyed ; if it has any meaning at all the truth or the importance of that meaning is the last reason humor would have for its happiness.39 The Audience and Occasion The rhetoric/poetic and wit/humor difference in audience and occasions prompting them is probably second in importance only to that of purpose at distinguishing the discourse types . The audience and occasion of poetic is generally a great deal more universal and certainly less confining than that of rhetoric . The orator 's discourse is determined to an important degree by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of some audience and some occasion . But these are both characteristically much broader than in rhetoric . . . The poet might speak to anybody , to everybody . . . or to nobody . He often appears to be speaking to all mankind and for all time . But the most important consideration here is that neither audience nor occasion has a direct or shaping influence on the nature of his discourse except in a comparatively broad sense.40 It is , rather , the subject that holds the poet 's mind : The poet , as Wordsworth reminds us , keeps his eye not on the audience or occasion , but on his subject : his subject fills his mind and engrosses his imagination , so that he is compelled , by excess of admiration or other emotion , to tell of it ; compelled , though no one hear or read his utterance.41 Not so with the rhetorician : The rhetorician stands at the opposite pole . He composes his discourse with his eye upon his audience and occasion . The occasion may dictate his very subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that he would have chosen if left to himself.42 The distinction generally holds true for wit and humor . Of course , some wit does seem to speak to broad segments of the human race without much dependence upon time and place of // occasion . Such witticism as G.B. Shaw 's remark , " Englishmen will never be slaves ; they are free to do whatever the government and public opinion allow them to do , " or Bierce 's definition : " Immoral : inexpedient , " seem to be recognizable examples . But much wit was created for a particular occasion and audience , and , as such , quickly becomes " dated . " Dorothy Parker once admitted of her satiric poetry : " Let 's face it , honey , my verse is terribly dated . " Much wit , indeed , is directed against particular people , knowledge of whom would be necessary in order to " " catch on " to the witticism . H.L. Mencken , for instance , thrust out at a particular politician in his definition : " " Democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having 37,000,000 native-born adult whites to choose from , including thousands who are handsome and many who are wise , pick out a Coolidge to be head of state . " Little that can be classified as more humorous than witty depends for much of its impact upon specific audience or occasion . These factors no more restrict the mimic comedy of Red Skelton or Charlie Chaplin than they have the pratfalls and mummery of jesters of any age . Jack Benny , kidding himself endlessly over his vanity and his stinginess attracted something akin to a universal audience . The circus clown plays equally well to the child , the adult , or the aged . But it is the young , the " cool " and " in " crowd that attends to a Mort Sahl or a Lenny Bruce . The acerbic and biting savagery of Bruce 's witty monologues brought down upon him much " establishment " ire and harassment , which must have combined with his many personal problems to bring him to an early grave . Sahl can not secure or maintain a regular sponsor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closes on Saturday night . " As with the other areas of difference between wit and humor , there are exceptions to the " rule . " Some humor is audience/occasion-bound , and some wit is a statement of universal truth . But on a continuum from " humor " to " " wit , " the work of such comedians as Skelton , and Benny , and George Gobel would stand toward the humor end , and that of Bruce and Sahl toward the wit end , in terms of dependence upon // audience and occasion . The reader of Swift 's " A Modest Proposal " might think it either foolish or satanic unless he were familiar with the eighteenth century barbarity which Swift was satirizing . Subject Matter If a form of discourse differs from another in specificity of audience and occasion , this fact would necessitate a similar difference in subject matter . In the case of rhetoric vs. poetic discourse , the usual subject matter difference is in breadth and timeliness of theme . Writes Bigelow : Rhetorical themes tend to be more limited in application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in keeping with the aesthetic purpose and the more general audience and occasion of poetic discourse , poetic themes tend to be more timeless and universal than rhetorical themes.43 Of course , some rhetorical masterpieces find themselves enshrined in a nation 's or the ' world 's literature because their originators spoke beyond their immediate audiences and occasions and touched upon universal and timeless values . Examples that come to mind are Lincoln 's Gettysburg Address and R.G. Ingersoll 's funeral oration at his brother 's grave . But such examples are as apt to be called " poetical " or even " flights of poetical fancy " as rhetoric . And , certainly , some poetry is written for a particular audience or occasion , and thus emphasizes temporal , immediacy-ridden themes . The world of letters is strewn with the poetry written almost on demand by persons in high office , and with poetry written to commemorate particular events and to enlist people in specific causes . An example of " poetry on demand " is the well-known poem of Oliver Wendell Holmes , " Old Ironsides , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S.S. Constitution . But , by and large , most poetry addresses itself to broader , more universal themes ; rhetoric speaks to the particular issue . The subject matter of humor , as hinted above in the section on audience and occasion , has a kind of universal and timeless appeal ; primarily this is because to engage in the business of humor is to enter a " play " world , however temporarily . When // we open our newspaper to " Peanuts " or " Beetle Bailey , " when we seat ourself in the nightclub or before the television set to attend to the stand-up comic , when we tell or listen to jokes at parties or at the office , we renounce the serious , " real " world around us and ready ourselves to hear or read nonsense , exaggeration , even idiocy or silliness . Max Eastman has insisted that the world of humor is a place to which we temporarily and symbolically return to the playful and happy mood of childhood , 44 a view which he shares with Freud . The successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stock material with wide audience appeal , drawing laughs ( many at himself ) because of human shortcomings widely and easily perceived . And this routine or stock material must be fanciful and exaggerated enough to create the " play frame " or attitude so that the audience can childishly dispense with reality-testing while enjoying the laughter . Thus we can laugh at Jack Benny 's miserliness and vanity knowing full well that no one could be that cheap and vain . We roar at Red Skelton 's Willie LumpLump without the necessity of wondering how Willie ever makes it through a routine day . We can enjoy the outrageous stories Alan King tells of his troubles with his wife and family , without really worrying about his home life . We can chuckle at Rodney Dangerfield 's self-deprecation knowing that , in the real world , no doorman would really ask Dangerfield to call him a cab . But the subject matter of the professional wit is usually of the here and now , the immediate , the real . The point has already been made that wit deals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thus false . Many witticisms are made on the spur of the moment , and become unrecognizable as wit outside of the particular event prompting it . Thus Tallulah Bankhead said after seeing a particular play , " There is less here than meets the eye . " Irwin S. Cobb , upon being informed that his mean boss was ailing , is reported to have quipped : " By God , I hope it is nothing trivial . " And to enjoy much of what we could call " wit , " we must usually be in possession of certain , particular knowledge . When Art Buchwald symbolically laments with other political humorists that there is nothing funny they can say or draw regarding George
