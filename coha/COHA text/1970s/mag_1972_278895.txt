Laughter in the Louvre ? As gross a solecism , one might think , as a belch in the Sainte-Chapelle . Yet for several weeks , visitors to the Louvre 's Museum of Decorative Arts have been convulsed with mirth over the work of a puckish artist from Marseille , Jacques Carelman . With his collection of " Objets In-trouvables " ( Unfindable Objects ) , Carelman has revived Surrealist humor and created the wittiest show to be seen in Paris in years . ( It will open in Dallas next winter . ) <P> " If I had to point to any one source of inspiration for my unfindable objects , " says Carelman , " I suppose it would be those old-fashioned mail-order catalogues , like the old Sears , Roebuck ones , with precise , naive drawings instead of the color pictures you find today . " Thtfse catalogues define a dreamworld of real consumer goods ; Carelman 's show presents an actual world of fantasy goods . The 50 creations on display include a masochist 's coffeepot with the spout over the handle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hourglass filled with pebbles , not sand , " for people who do n't want to grow old " ; a pipe with four different faucets for water at different temperatures ; a hammer with a handle so bent that nobody can hit his thumb ; a cat-shaped traveling bag with handles and a perforated Plexiglas nose for taking one 's pet tabby on a trip ; an " absorbent bottle " made out of sponge , " to double its capacity " ; and an undulating Ping Pong table , to " project the ball unpredictably . " <P> Art lovers of a philosophical bent may ponder an empty frame bearing the label A Knife Without a Blade Whose Handle Is Missing . Georg-Christoph Lichtenberg , 1742-1799* The more athletic ones can equip themselves for the outback with a bizarre weapon whose barrel undulates like a snake : it is a kangaroo gun , " whose specially studied trajectory enables the bullet to follow the bounding animal . " <P> Says Carelman , 42 , a onetime dental surgeon who has become well known as a designer and cartoonist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of society , all societies-but especially the wasteful consumer society . My defense against the aggressiveness of objects is derision , humor . I deal with objects everyone is familiar with , like a hammer . I deform them and people get a shock . Children react the best , intellectuals second best . " <P> Says Francois Carree , assistant curator of the Museum of Decorative Arts : " No one has better taken into account the all-too-rational limits of our system of objects . Carelman thinks of everything and everybody , of the prolongations of technology as well as new categories of ignored consumers : acrobats , mourners , the one-legged ... The infinitesimal shift thus revealed to us is what separates poetry from reality , and the most invigorating humor from the crass stupidity of profit making . " A child at the show was more succinct . " As a convinced masochist , " he told the artist , " I take my hat off to you . " <P> <P> * A German scientist , critic and aphorist , whose name apparently strikes Carelman as inherently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidential ticket of Wintergreen and Throttlebottom.
