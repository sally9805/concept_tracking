txt COPPER HARBOR , Mich . ? The dawn is overcast and damp . " A good day to run bear , " says Duck Boone .. " The dogs can run with their heads up . gf rnTIOPT %PPM " By midmorning he 'll be proved right . Boone , 61 , is dean of the houndsmen who come every year at this time from North Carolina and the Pacific Northwest to hunt black bear in this big-timber land at the tip of the Reweenaw Peninsula ? and sometimes generate controversy over their methods . With the party of 15 men are 20 to 30 hounds , carefully bred and trained for this single purpose and commonly worth at least $1,000 each . The pack , mostly Plotts , includes redbones , black-andtans , and blue-ticks . Superbly conditioned , they weigh perhaps 25 pounds and are so lean they appear , misleadingly , to be underfed . THE MOTORIZED safari  --  four pickup trucks modified with camper tops or dog-boxes ? inches along the Mandan Road , 27 miles of dirt winding through the forest southeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on each camper or dog-box top is a " rig " dog afoot it would be a Photos on the Back Page strike dog , the vanguard of the pack , Its head swiveling as ft strains for the scent of bear . Boone follows in a sedan , coordinating moves via CB radio . At a am. , well into daylight , the party stops to talk strategy at a fork where an overgrown trail leads off into the timber . The group is built around a nucleus of veteran houndhunters , mostly well-off businessmen who follow the bear seasons : Winter in Washington state , summer in Colorado , early fall in Michigan , and later in ' North Carolina , which is home for most . THE NORTH Carolinians Include Tom Wilson , 57 , a retired trucking operator , and Jim Hickey , 96 , a supermarket owner , both from Boone 's hometown of Spruce Pine ; and Hoyte Dillingham , 39 , a country grocer with a general store in Bernardsville . From Washington there Is Dave Johnson , 35 , of Everson , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fork , Dillingham and Johnson // Column 1 Dogs are key to bear hunt // have found a bear track , imperceptible at first to an untrained eye . " Put a cold-nosed dog on it , " says Boone . Dillingham explains . " An ordinary hound will pick up a scent up to 12 hours old . This track 's older , maybe a day . A cold-nose ' will follow a scent as old as 24 hours . " The cold-nose , Drum , turns away , failing to pick up a scent . " Something wrong with that dog , " Boone will say later in the day , knowing he may be pronouncing a death sentence . " It does n't cost any more to feed a good dog than a bad one , " the houndsmen say . DILLINGIIAM AND Johnson probe deeper into the woods as the tracks leave the trail . Dillingham brings out dependable hounds : Twister , Diablo , Heavy , Cheta , Nola , Dixie , Tippy , and Blondie . Joined by several younger men , the strike team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hounds , now picking up a strong scent , are baying in what seems a confused chorus . " Every man here can tell his own hounds by the sound , " says Boone . " And every hound can tell the sound of his owner 's truck . " Boone , knowing he ca n't keep up with the hounds " They 'll run as far as 10 or 15 miles at a clip " , drives west along the road and pulls off when the sounds seem to center on one place , half a mile away . He gets out and looks at the sky ; a darker cloud deck is moving in from the east and light rain has begun . BOONE COCKS his bead as the hounds ' baying goes to a faster tempo and a higher pitch : " Yo-yo , yo-yo , yoyo . " " They 've got him treed , " says Boone . At that instant a rifle barks once , then twice more in rapid succession . " Dead bear , " says Boone . He was wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 7 and 10 years old , was not treed . She was brought to bay in a swamp and encircled by the hounds . Johnson brought her down with one shot from a .30-06 at 25 feet ; one of the younger men fired two quick insurance shots before the dogs closed in . That instant is of critical importance , Dillingham explains . A wounded bear will kill a dog with a single snap of its jaws or the swipe of a paw . Once the dogs hear a shot , they will assume the bear is dead and walk right up to it . The party loads the bear on the back of a pickup and heads for camp to feed and rest the dogs . They always come first ; if one is seriously hurt , the hunt is abandoned for a trip to a veterinarian . Next comes reporting the kill to the nearest state Department of Natural Resources DNB facility , in this case Ft . Wilkins State Park . David LaPointe , park manager and DNR officer , checks the hunters ' licenses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof of a legal kill . Dressing the bear will yield about halt its weight in edible meat , which is frozen in borrowed or rented local freezers , then packed in Styrofoam for the trip back home . It will keep . Some locals express mild criticism of the use of hounds in bear hunting , though it 's nothing like the antihunting indignation that imbued the TV special , " The Guns of Autumn , " two years ago . THESE HUNTERS , like others , still smart under what they believe are unjustified attacks . " Unless we bring a bear to bay , we will not kill it , " says Johnson . " The difference between us and the ' still ' hunter is that if he sees it , he kills it . " The houndsman is his own conservation officer . Well-managed bear hunting is the only way to control the bear population . " LaPointe agrees that the hound-hunter is probably more sportsmanlike than the city hunter who comes up from Detroit on the first day of the season and waits outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unsuspecting , and then pops it . " Now we 've got an ordinance in Grant Township that prohibits shooting a bear within 500 feet of the perimeter of a garbage dump , " says LaPointe . " YOU 'VE GOT tourists who think It 's just terrible to shoot those nice animals . But there has to be some way of cropping the bear population , or we 'd be a little Yellowstone . " We 'd be full ? of nuisance bears . That 's the bear that browses around the tourist cabins , , gets fed , and loses its fear of humans . When that happens , the bear becomes dangerous . " The bear population ? probably well over 10,000 in Michigan ? is remaining stable , because the number of kills remains constant at roughly 1,000 . If the bear population were hurting , the number of kills would keep going down . " THE KILL ITSELF Is almost mittenmactic , although Boone clearly is looking forward to bear meat . " You 've got to marinate it pretty good to get the wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use a lot of celery , onions , carrots . But then you get something special . " I fed It to a bunch who thought it was the tenderest beef they ever ate . My God , they laid their ears back and dug in , it was so good . When I told them It was bear meat , they like to got sick . " " A bear 's pelt makes a dandy coat , or even a trophy , " says LaPointe . " There 's something macho abort saying , ' I killed a bear . ' " This group does not seem preoccupied with trophies . Dillingham , who has folded his mountainous hulk into a chair that seems too small , says he does n't much care whether he shoots a boar or not : it 's the hunt that holds him . 4101FortWlkins ? copper Harbor statePork = N ? at SVP0110r :
