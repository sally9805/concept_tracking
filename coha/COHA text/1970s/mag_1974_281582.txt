Gerald Ford demonstrated one refreshing presidential trait last week : when the heat is on , he does not flee the kitchen . Despite the outcry over his premature pardon of Richard Nixon , Ford held the second press conference of his presidency-in prime televiewing time . Apart from some touchy questions about the CIA in Chile , most of the questions ( 16 out of 20 ) related to Nixon . Most of the questioners implied , and some said with insulting directness , that Ford had been deceptive and devious in reaching his decision . The President unflinchingly stood his ground . <P> Was there some undisclosed reason that made him shift so abruptly and free Nixon from prosecution ? " I had no secret reason , " Ford replied . But was n't Nixon guilty of an impeachable offense ? Ford found the unanimous report of the House Judiciary Committee " very persuasive " and conceded that acceptance of a pardon " can be construed ... as an admission of guilt . " Ford thought it was sufficient that Nixon had been " shamed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon 's ill health were not a major factor ( " I was more anxious to heal the nation " ) . He conceded that new negotiations were under way with Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski on the controversial arrangement under which Nixon would retain effective control of his tapes and presidential papers . As for the pardon , however , " there was no understanding , no deal , between me and the former President . " Ford admitted that " the decision has created more antagonism than I anticipated . " <P> Inevitably , Ford was asked why he gave a full pardon to Nixon and only conditional amnesty to Viet Nam War evaders . Ford said that he saw no real connection between the two-hardly a convincing reply . Overall , it was a gutsy performance under fire , although Ford 's explanation of the timing of the pardon remained thoroughly unsatisfying . <P> Continuing his frenzied pace but in an imperturbable fashion , Ford in one day rushed through eleven meetings , running from 8 a.m. until past 10:30 p.m . At a press party the next evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first male president of the formerly all women 's Washington Press Club , commented : " I guess it just proves that in America anyone can be President . " In his own speech , Ford quipped : " You do n't need a pool in the White House to get into deep water . " <P> Sharp Defeat . Ford 's extraverted socializing included some golfing with members of Congress . Yet this did not avert a sharp congressional defeat for him on the first issue on which he directly challenged the legislators . The Senate rejected , by a vote of 64 to 35 , Ford 's plan to save $700 million by postponing for three months a pay raise for federal employees . <P> Ford continued to grapple with problems of fratricide within his own staff , mainly between his recent appointees and Nixon holdovers . The imminent exit of Chief of Staff Alexander Haig , who was approved by the NATO Council last week as Supreme Allied Commander of Europe effective Dec. 15 , will help ; more departures may follow .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
