TO the casual visitor , Northbrook , Ill. , is just another quiet bedroom community on the outskirts of Chicago . To the 27,000 citizens who live there , it has always been the busy , bristling " Speed-Skating Capital of America . " Until recently there may have been some doubters of that heady claim . Not now . Not after two of the town 's favorite daughters , Anne Henning and Dianne Holum , skated off with gold medals in the 1972 Winter Games . Indeed , the local Chamber of Commerce has already begun to engrave its stationery with a new slogan : " Speed-Skating Capital of the World . " <P> Why Northbrook ? For one thing , there is Ed Rudolph , 60 , a onetime high school skating champion who has devoted nearly 20 years to training Northbrook youngsters in his sport . A landscape contractor who also serves as the Northbrook park commissioner , Rudolph began his program by designing baseball diamonds that could be frozen over in the winter for skating . With strong financial and moral support from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern indoor facility that is in operation 24 hours a day throughout the weekends . <P> Beginning each May , Rudolph 's charges spend five months in " dry training " : calisthenics , running and bicycling . Then they hit the road for West Allis , Wis. , and the only Olympic-sized artificial rink in the U.S. Traveling in a car pool run by their parents , they visit the bleak Wisconsin state fairgrounds every day for six straight months , spending three hours a day on the ice and three hours in transit . <P> Anne Henning , a cheery , curly-haired blonde who never travels without her lucky Snoopy button and a large supply of peanut butter , does not miss the social life that is ruled out by her training regimen . Says she : " There are lots of boys in the training group too , you know . " Dianne Holum , a fiercely dedicated competitor who worked as a waitress last year to help finance a three-month training stint in The Netherlands , adds : " I do n't mind the sacrifices . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Even so , the demands are such that many young skaters have to drop out of school and study with a tutor . To pay the $1,000 to $2,000 a year that it takes for the care and feeding of a skater , some Northbrook mothers take part-time jobs . Is it worth it ? Anne 's father , Bill Henning , thinks so . " The U.S. is the only country in the Northern Hemisphere where speed skating is not a major sport , " he explains . " Our hope is to make it one . "
