" It is either a viewers ' revolt or Nielsen has screwed up his figures , " says one network executive . " I 've been in this business since 1948 , " adds a New York rep for a number of major-market stations , " and I ca n't remember a crummier season than this one . " <P> These are not aesthetic judgments . What is bugging the broadcasters is a drop of 4%-perhaps more-in the number of sets in use . Just as alarming is a fall-off in network ratings among viewers who are still bothering to tune in something or other . To date , helped by its nighttime World Series coverage , NBC has the best prime-time rating . But it is only a 19.3 , which just a year ago would have been second in the standings . Indeed , NBC is winning while losing , with its rating down 5% compared with the same period last year . CBS , for 20 years the ratings leader , is in even worse shape , suffering a 12% loss ( and the ignominy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Thin and Thin . Where have all the people gone ? Can it be that for once they believed the critics , who , upon previewing the new season , unanimously declared it unfit for human consumption ? Is there a silent protest ? Possibly . But there is not and never has been any such thing as a really good television season , and though this may be the absolute worst , that has to be a distinction so fine as to require deliberation by a board of moral philosophers . No one has yet determined how many bad ideas can dance on the pinhead of a network programming executive ; the outside limit may not have been reached . <P> Besides , some experts suspect the defections from network programming are confined to a not much coveted demographic group-viewers 50 and older . <P> Some insiders insist that the 39-49 crowd - still demon consumers-have joined the Geritol set . And that they are all responding to a decline in quality . According to this argument , the networks have tied themselves too tightly to a small group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose shows inevitably have a certain sameness about them . Universal is responsible for 8% prime-time hours ( out of 22 ) on NBC alone this year . Some of the good independents like Norman Lear and Mary Tyler Moore are also overextended - and overimitated . This gives viewers a narrow range of choices : cop and doc shows , ethnic sitcoms , nice-girl sitcoms . It has become harder to tell good from bad in this small spectrum . Still , the suspicion lingers that TV 's real-if possibly temporary-trouble springs from precisely the opposite condition . <P>
