txt Fifteen years ago , cigarette bootlegging was strictly for amateurs . Vacationers on their way home from Florida saved a few dollars by stocking up in states like North Carolina with low cigarette taxes . But then came enormous increases in cigarette taxes in places like New York , pushing the price differential to as much as 21 cents a pack . Professional bootleggers now shuttle back and forth between the low-tax and high-tax states . High-tax states , like New York , Texas , Florida and Pennsylvania , are losing an estimated $400 million a year to organized crime . In New York City about half the cigarettes sold escape taxation ; for the state as a whole , about $80 million in revenue is being siphoned off by smugglers . Since enforcement of the law has . proved impossible , the only answer is to take the profit out of bootlegging by cutting the difference between low and high cigarette tax rates . There are two obvious ways to do that : Raise the low taxes or lower the high taxes . The tobacco industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States that have a smuggling problem are as free to pare taxes today as they were to raise them in the 1960 's . Revenue drainoffs to- bootleggers have become so large that the biggest loser , New York , would actually gain by lowering its rate . Legislation to do exactly that is pending in Albany and deserves quick passage . The bill would reduce the state tax by a penny a pack and eliminate the 8-cent New York City tax entirely , with the state indemnifying the city for revenue losses . A special state task force has estimated that the tax reduction would come entirely at the expense of the cigarette bootleggers and would raise state revenues by several million dollars . The benefit of such a tax reduction to New York is clear . But the approach may prove less attractive to other high-tax states where bootlegging is not yet the problem it is in New York . Such states would sacrifice considerable sums by lowering cigarette taxes , and would have to make up for the losses with less popular levies . That is why a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette tax proposals vary in detail , but share a common structure . A uniform Federal tax , somewhat lower than current rates in high-tax states , would be added to the 8-cent-a-pack Federal excise tax now collected from manufacturers . Revenues would be rebated to the states in proportion to cigarette sales . States and municipalities would be discouraged from collecting their own tax by having whatever they raise deducted from their shares of the Federal tax proceeds . One argument against the uniform tax comes from those who resist Federal encroachment on state taxing prerogatives , but that " states rights " case seems superficial . The free flow of people and goods makes it impossible for each state to tax exactly as it pleases . One might as easily argue that low-tax states are at present interfering with the rights of high-tax states . A compromise in which the Federal Government plays honest broker is a reasonable solution to interstate conflict . Individual states would be wise to consider lowering cigarette taxes on their own . A modest revenue loss is a small price to pay to defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solving the problem for good is through national action . We need a uniform cigarette tax .
