Though a growing number of surgeons are learning how to transplant hearts , the operation seems destined to remain a rarity because donors are scarce and the problem of tissue rejection is still unsolved . Therefore , researchers have been working for more than a decade to develop an implantable artificial heart . Last week , Dr. Adrian Kantrowitz , the surgical pioneer who performed the first heart transplant in the U.S. , moved the effort a significant step forward . In Detroit 's Sinai Hospital , he put an artificial heart booster into the chest of Haskell Shanks , 63 , whose heart was so weakened that it could not pump enough oxygenated blood to his body . <P> The operation was hardly the first attempt to use an artificial heart device in humans . Dr. Michael DeBakey has tried temporary pumping mechanisms on eight patients , two of whom are still alive . Kantrowitz has twice installed permanent heart pumps in patients , one of whom survived for 13 days . But last week 's operation differed from the previous ones . Kantrowitz 's new pump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but because of a specially developed inner coating , it is less likely to trigger the blood-clotting problems that plagued earlier implants . Therefore it has a better chance of remaining in the patient indefinitely . Hence it could offer new hope for patients with intractable congestive heart failure . <P> Cigar Shape . Described as a patch booster , the pump is an improved model of the device developed in 1966 by Kantrowitz and his brother Arthur , a physicist . Made of silicone rubber and Dacron , the booster is deceptively simple in construction . Six inches long and shaped like a cigar , it consists of two tubes , a balloon-like outer bladder surrounding a narrow tube , with an air hose that leads from the outer tube to a helium-powered driving unit and compressed air tank outside the body . <P> Installation of the pump was intricate business . Shanks , who was near death , was wheeled into the operating room at 7:15 p.m . Doctors opened his chest and slit the descending aorta , the downward trunk of the main artery leading from the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , led the air hose out through the chest and connected it to the exterior tank . The procedure took five hours , but it was not until 5 a.m. that Shanks left the operating room ; Kantrowitz kept him there until he was certain that the booster was doing its job . <P> It did just that . A regulator unit connected to the heart muscle by wires kept the external pump in phase with the internal organ . As the heart 's left ventricle , or major pumping chamber , contracted to force blood through the aorta , the external pump sucked air out of the outer tube , creating negative pressure that helped pull the blood out of the ventricle . Then , as the ventricle relaxed , the pump forced air back into the outer tube , increasing the pressure on the inner passage and forcing the blood through the aorta to the body . <P> Shanks ' heart was relieved of at least half the work of supplying blood to his body . Only hours after the operation , he was doing well . But Kantrowitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient returns home . Shanks is not yet ready for that .
