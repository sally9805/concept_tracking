txt On a sunny spring day four , years ago , as red and yellow tulips pushed through the snow along the streets of Toronto , Thomas Glenn Jolley laid the foundation for a quanThomas G. Jolley dare that now confronts him and the governments of the United States and Canada . He walked into the United States Consular Office in the Canadian city and signed a I formal declaration that renounced his American citizenship . The next day he mailed his Selective Service card to the draft board in his home town of Bremen , Ga. , a small mill town near the Alabama state line . Included was a note : " Yesterday , May 16 , I renounced my U. S. citizenship , thus terminating all obligations to the United States . I say ' obligations ' with tongue-in-cheek because my concept of an obligation and yours are miles apart , several hundred in fact . " Court Battles Fought Since that day , Mr. Jolley , a soft-spoken , boyish reporter for The Tallahassee Democrat , lies gone through a series of court battles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his renunciation in 1967. was made . under duress ? that it had been the only legal way left open to him tol protest the draft and the war in Vietnam . But the United States Supreme Court refused last week to hear Mr. Jolley 's appeal , and the Immigration and Naturalization Service said he had 90 days to leave this country or be deported . This is not easily accomplished , however , either for Mr. Jolley or for the Government . His present status , according to the immigration service , is that of a " stateless " alien , a man without a country . Since his passport is now invalid , lie would have difficulty . // Draft Poe Becomes Man Without a Country ; U.S. in Quandary // acquiring a visa to another country . The United States Government , on the other hand , must find another country willing to accept Mr. Jolley before he can be deported . And because the deportation of a natural-born citizen is a rare event in this country , a nation of immigrants , the laws governing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , it now appears likely that Mr. Jolley can be legally deported only to Canada , a nation whose citizens enjoy free and unlimited travel in the United States . " For all practical purposes , " said a spokesman for the State Department , " if he Mr. Jolley was deported to Canada he would be free to come and go in this country as he pleases . " If Canada refused to receive Mr. Jolley , which it well might , he would remain indefinitely in his homeland , stripoed of certain civil rights and under the permanent supervision , hut not the custody , of immigration officials . Although Mr. Jolley 's plight appears unique , his fate is sure to be followed with interest by thousands of young Americans who , as he did , fled the United States after the onset of the war in Vietnam to avoid military service . It is believed that there may be more than 30,000 young Americans living in Canada who are in this category and who will be watching , now that the war is winding down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is also believed that the case may set the tone for a growing concept of general amnesty for all the young Americans whose lives have been ripped apart by the war . Advocates contend that amnesty should be extended without prejudice to such men as Mr. Jolley , who objected to the war on moral grounds , as well as to such men as First Lieut . William L. Calley Jr . Those who know Thomas Glenn Jolley find it strange that he should be caught in the web of problems that now ensnares him . In his own words , he is " sickeningly normal . " He is a polite , meticulous young man , now 27 , who wears conservative pin-striped suits with vest and is clean shaven . " When he first came to work here , and no one knew his background , he was just a shy little guy who did n't say a word to anyone , " said Patricia Spillan , a member of the news staff of The Tallahassee Democrat , which Mr. Jolley joined 15 months ago . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite some community pressure , when his appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit last spring prompted th first news stories about the " man without a country . " Mr. Jolley has no criminal record although the Government tried to prosecute him for draft evasion when he returned to this countryi n 1968 . Since he had renounced his citizenship when he was still in good standing with the Selective Service System , and because he was technically an alien living in another country at the time his induction notice was sent out , the case was dropped . Mr. Jolley has since asserted that his renunciation was not voluntary since it was made under pressure from the draft , a position the courts have refused to validate . I " I was surprised the Supreme Court did n't give us the privilege of oral arguments , " Mr. Jolley said the other day as he relaxed in the one-bedroom apartment he shares with his wife , Margie , a graduate student in clinical psychology at Florida State University . " It seems like they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to Canada , he said , and while still a student at the University of Georgia , he applied for status as a conscientious objector but was turned down by his draft board . " They asked me two or three questions and told me to forget it , " he said . " They knew I was raised in a small Southern Baptist Church , which is not exactly known for any antiwar stand , and they said there simply was no basis for a C.O. deferment on this kind of background . As far as I know there has never been a single C.O. to ever come out of Bremen . " Mr. Jolley 's attorney , Mrs. Elizabeth Rindskopf of Atlanta , said she felt the Supreme Court 's recent rulings would qualify her client for deferment today as a conscientious objector , but the government has not considered this in its deportation proceedings , " He 's a model citizen In every way and would be an asset to any country , but this is his home and this is where he belongs , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people felt about Thomas Glenn Jolley , including those in Bremen , Ga. , which in 1962 gave the straight-A student its award for citizenship .
