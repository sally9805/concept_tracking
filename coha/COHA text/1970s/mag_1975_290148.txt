In size , scope and excellence of quality , the Robert Lehman Collection - now ensconced in a special wing of New York 's Metropolitan Museum and soon to be seen by the public-was the last of its kind . It was started 70 years ago by the investment banker Philip Lehman , head of Lehman Brothers ; his son developed it into a great private collection along the legendary pattern of the Morgan or the Frick . It ranges from Renaissance pottery and medieval acquamanilia ( water vessels ) to Rembrandts , El Grecos and an astounding collection of more than 1,000 14th-19th century drawings . Parts of this hoard were occasionally lent to institutions like the Orangerie in Paris , but nobody had regular access to it except Lehman 's friends and a small circle of approved art historians .

The $7.1 million Lehman pavilion was merely the first phase . But it is certainly the most spectacular , as well as controversial . Seen from Central Park , it is dominated by a 67-ft. - high glass pyramid built onto the museum 's original Victorian faade , with an atrium below , two levels of gray limestone ambulatories , and ( sealed off from daylight on the main floor ) so-called period rooms in which the greatest paintings hang .
