Associate Editor Frank Merrick first met Edward Moore Kennedy in 1962 , when Kennedy , then 30 , made his initial bid for a seat in the U.S. Senate and Merrick was reporting for the Holyoke , Mass. , Transcript-Telegram . In the next 17 years Merrick often wrote about the Massachusetts Senator , tracing his career as one of history 's most famous noncandidates . Now in this week 's cover story , Merrick has Kennedy off and running at last as a formidable presidential candidate . <P> Despite all the press coverage that Kennedy attracts , the Senator remains an enigmatic subject . Says Merrick : " Everyone may know about his troubled marriage and his sailing at Cape Cod , but little is known about what he really thinks . He has lived in the public eye so long that he has become a master at shielding his privacy . " <P> Washington Correspondent Neil MacNeil , who assessed Kennedy 's Senate activities for the cover story , agrees : " Unlike his brother Bobby , who had close friends and enemies among reporters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to follow Jack Kennedy 's maxim that ' in politics , you do n't have friends-only allies . ' " Adds Boston Bureau Chief Hays Gorey , whose reporting for the story reflects years of tracking the entire Kennedy clan : " Ted will let you follow him around so you can try to figure out where he comes from , but he is well aware of where you come from , always . " <P> To penetrate Kennedy 's private reserve , Washington Bureau Chief Robert Ajemian met with him in two settings where the Senator is most at ease : his small hideaway office in the Capitol , once occupied by Brother . Jack , and the library at his McLean , Va. , home . Ajemian also drew upon insights into Kennedy developed over 16 years of covering him , first for LIFE and later for TIME . <P> Says Ajemian , " I 've sensed how to decipher Kennedy 's spare offerings on questions about his own psychology . The incomplete sentences and body language , the voice up or trailing , the eye restless or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open than his brothers . Bobby took things more personally . Ted is more cautious .
