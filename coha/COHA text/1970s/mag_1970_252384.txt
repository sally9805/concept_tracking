SOLAR eclipses are one of nature 's most fascinating events - and also one of the most dangerous for observers . As more and more of the solar disk is blotted out , the sky darkens , and it becomes easier to gaze directly at the sun . While the visible light lessens , however , the pupils of the viewer 's eyes dilate , allowing infra-red radiation from the still uncovered crescent of the sun to focus on his retinas . Although he feels no pain , the infra-red can quickly burn his retinas , causing irreparable damage to his vision . To avoid eye injury , medical authorities suggest that observers who look directly at an eclipse should do so only through at least two fully exposed photographic negatives that have been developed to maximum density . Sunglasses , welders ' goggles or smoked glass do not provide adequate protection . To be completely safe , the eclipse watcher should turn his back to the sun and hold up a card with a pinhole . The sun 's rays will be focused by the hole and projected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface a short distance away .
