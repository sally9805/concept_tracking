The Soviet army of today is still isolated , though not much more so than armies of other major powers . Perhaps the greatest difference is that it enjoys far higher prestige and power within its country than its Western counterparts do in theirs .

Deferments are rare . In any army , a recruit 's life is uncomfortable at best . The Soviet army is no exception . The new recruit sleeps in tents in summer . In winter he sleeps in bleak barracks where he has a bunk , night table and a tiny cupboard for toilet articles . Once a week , many platoons visit the nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> With a starting wage of three rubles a month ( $3.33 ) , the recruit usually spends most of it at his unit 's bufet on candies and cookies to liven up his nourishing but dull diet . Breakfast usually consists of kasha ( cereal porridge ) , bread and tea . Lunch , the main meal , may include herring , onions , a bowl of potato or vegetable soup with a chunk of meat in it , macaroni or beans , and more bread .

Draftees are allowed to leave the camp on Sunday , and get a ten-day leave once during a two-year tour . While off base , they are forbidden to drink anything stronger than beer .
