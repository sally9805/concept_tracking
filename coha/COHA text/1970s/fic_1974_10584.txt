side there are many who dare to take their part , repudiating natural adult allegiances in the cause of revolution and truth . As yet , Brian has won most of the pitched battles ; but the effort of winning is exhausting his resources , and he knows it . He knows that time is against him , and he can not win the war . Even now his victories are all negative ones : he has , once more , beaten off an attack on some stronghold , or contained the enemy within the existing combat zone . He can , for example , wearily congratulatehimself on the fact that his children do not  --  as far as he knows  --  steal cars or bomb buildings or inject themselves with drugs ; that they have not got themselves arrested by the police yet , or pregnant . Sometimes Brian wishes they had done so ; then at least they would be somewhere else  --  in jail or an unwed-mothers ' home  --  and someone else would be responsible for them . What makes the war most exhausting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has deserted him . She has declared , not so much verbally as by her recent actions , that she can not fight any more , that she is giving up the effort . This defection seems to him profoundly unjust ; even dishonorable . For years the Tates ' domesticlife has been governed according to the principle of separation of powers : Erica functioning as the executive branch , and Brian as the legislative and judicial . He has always left it to her to supervise the children in everyday matters . Now when  --  possibly as a consequence of her management  --  the children have grown into selfish , rude , rebellious adolescents , she resigns and declares that it is his turn . Which is as if the President and his Cabinet should abdicate and turn over the task of suppressing a colonial revolt to Congress and the Supreme Court . Under normal circumstances Brian would not have permitted this . But circumstances are not normal ; Erica is not normal . For the last six weeks especially she has been behaving in a very abnormal way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and openly bored by it ; overtalkative and silent . In bed she feels peculiar : half stiff , half limp ; she comes late with a wrench and an angry cry , or does not come at all . She appears onp99campus at odd times of day with no explanation , and serves supper up to half an hour late with no excuse . It has not occurred to Brian that his wife suspects him of having an affair , since he can not imagine she would keep silent about that . What he fears is that she is coming down with a mental illness ; and since yesterday , Wednesday , he has feared it more . On Tuesdays and Fridays , Brian has lunch with Wendy in her Collegetown apartment ; on Mondays and Thursdays with his colleagues at the Faculty Club . On Wednesdays , however , he has a class until one-fifteen followed by a committee meeting at two . He therefore buys coffee from the machine in the basement , and Erica packs his lunch ( sandwich , fruit , and cake or cookies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time she also packs lunch boxes for the children , washes the breakfast dishes , sweeps the kitchen , and takes out the trash  --  the bottles and papers and cans to one container , the garbage , in a paper bag , to another . This Wednesday after his class , Brian returned to the office accompanied by a radical graduate student named Davidoff who had proposed a dubious project for his seminar paper . While outlining his objections to this project Brian sat down at his desk , uncovered his container of coffee , and upended his paper bag . Instead of lunch , what fell out onto the blotter was a heap of coffee grounds , crushed eggshells , orange rinds , crusts of toast stained with jelly , and soggy Frosted Flakes . " Hey , wow ! " Davidoff exclaimed , laughing good-naturedly . " Is that your lunch ? " Equally annoying , and perhaps more disturbing , was Erica 's reaction that evening . She seemed to be aware only of the humor of the incident and not of what it implied about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's all , " she kept saying , obviously suppressing an impulse to laugh as Davidoff had done , but more ill-naturedly . " You already said that , " he told her . " What I was asking you is why you should make that sort of mistake . What it means . "  | " What could it mean ? " Erica stopped smiling and looked at Brian in what seemed to him a disturbed way . " Well , that you were disturbed , or unconsciously angry at me . " " Why should I be angry at you ? " Erica 's tone was ambiguous ; for a moment he imagined she knew everything . Fortunately , he was not startled enough to lose the offensive . " I could n't say . What concerns me is  --  " and he went on to list other failings of Erica 's which concerned him . But her question has remained hanging in the air ever since , half visible , like a cobweb . It is hanging there now . Suppose she does know , Brian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows . But then , why does n't she tell him she knows ? If she does n't know , then her behavior is crazy . Unless of course she is still angry about what she does know , about last spring . Should he admit that he knows this ? Brian blinks ; he feels as if spiders were at work in his head , spinning sticky gray webs of conjecture from point to point . Or are they in Erica 's head ? But these spiders are not the most serious of Brian 's troubles this morning . His doubts about his wife 's mental condition , the dislike he feels for his children , and his professional irritations and disappointments , all are as nothing today to the problem of Wendy Gahaghan . To put it briefly , Wendy has recently become preoccupied with the idea of bearing a child preferably Brian 's child . She mentioned this interest at first casually , some weeks ago , in reply to a compliment from him : " Yeah , they 're all right  --  only I sort of wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I have a baby , I 'm going to breast-feed it for six months at least  --  that makes your boobs grow , you know . " A week later the theme recurred : " Gail says if it was n't for the population problem she and Danny would have five or six kids . I can groove on that , you know ? I mean if you love somebody you naturally want to have as many kids with them as you can ; like I 'd like to have kids with you . " This remark made Brian uneasy ; apprehensive . As a form ofp101insurance , he told Wendy that he sincerely hoped her friends were n't planning to become parents at once ; he elaborated upon the harm which was so often done to society , to their children and to themselves by people who reproduced irresponsibly , before they were economically or emotionally mature . Ecologically speaking , it was just littering in every sense . And then finally on Friday , when they last met  --  and at a very intimate moment : " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with heredity . I mean I was thinking just the other day , if you and I had a baby , what it would look like . " Brian refused to speculate on the appearance of this hypothetical infant . " I do n't know , and I do n't ever want to know , " he said . Drawing back , he looked at Wendy 's smooth , slightly convex belly uneasily , imagining it inflate before his eyes like a pale balloon . " That 'd be the end of everything . Anyhow , you do n't want to think about babies now , your job is to think about finishing graduate school , " he added , smiling uselessly , for Wendy had turned her face away . " Okay ? " A silence . " Okay , " Wendy finally replied , turning back , also smiling . But her smile was not very happy , Brian recalls , and she left soon afterward . Probably he had hurt her feelings . He had realized this even then , and planned to straighten things out when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department meeting . He called the apartment that morning , something he always dislikes doing , and as he feared got only Wendy 's roommate . He left a brief , perhaps brusque messageno doubt hurting Wendy 's feelings again , for she has not called back . It is now Thursday noon , and she has still not called , nor come around to the office . What he has to explain to Wendy is that his reaction to her baby fantasy was not meant to hurt , but was natural , automatic . He is too old to have any more children ( indeed , he sometimes thinks , too old to bear the ones he already has ) . But if Wendy has daydreams of becoming a mother , that too is only natural . He has daydreams himself : imagining himself nationally recognized as ap102political analyst ; called to New York or Washington , legally and financially free to enjoy life there ; to meet someone perhaps , in certain respects , like Wendy . He has entertained these fantasies as often as Wendy hers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he will never be famous or free . He will have to sit in this same office until he retires , legally and financially bound to Corinth University and to three people toward whom he feels almost nothing now but obligation : a woman who hates him and is having a nervous collapse , and two revolting ( in both senses ) adolescents . It is the bitterness of this , perhaps , which made him speak hastily to Wendy , whose life is not over . He admits it . He spoke hastily to her , and harshly . All right , Brian thinks . I hurt Wendy 's feelings . It is up to me to apologize , to point out that I felt no revulsion from her maternal fantasies , only a practical concern that they should not become reality yet . What I should do now is call her up and explain this . Brian looks at the telephone on his desk , but does not lift it . It is noon , and Wendy is probably at home ; but so , unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-haired girl with large hands and feet and a breathy manner , who sometimes trips on mind-expanding drugs . Brian regards Linda with wariness and antipathy , both because of what he knows about her and because of what she knows about him . Wendy insists that Linda is really straight and loyal , that she would never cop out , but he is not convinced . He has a recurrent dread that on one of her trips Linda 's mind will expand so far that his name will leak out through the cracks . Brian avoids Linda whenever possible . If he sees her approachinghim on campus he turns onto another path , climbs unnecessary stairs , or abruptly enters the nearest building . In closed spaces such as the coffee shop , he either pretends not to notice Linda or gives her a rapid , hearty " Hello " and moves off as fast as possible . At his earnest request , Wendy has so arranged it that Linda is always out of the apartment when he comes to lunch.  |p103He  feels a suspicious dislike of even speaking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tightening his face , Brian decides to wait until tomorrow , when he will see Wendy , and not to worry about it meanwhile . Yet when he stops in the department office on his way to lunch and recognizes her handwriting on an envelope among the junk mail in his box , his facial muscles loosen in relief . " Good news , I hope ? " asks Helen Wells , the department secretary , observing this relaxation . " No , just advertisements and bills , " replies Brian . Smiling , he takes his mail back upstairs to read in the privacy of his office , opening it , as always , in reverse order of interest .

Dear BrainI guess maybe this is the last letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind because I figured I would write you and rap with you the rest of my life . Which maybe was n't saying so much . The end of everything as you so firmly said so I 'm splitting as you know , and want . I would have dug discussing what it means that it happened , getting into why and how but when I tried to bring up the topic I got such bad vibes from you I could n't hack it . Like Professor Frankel said I have sometimes the difficulty in expression . My hangup . I was too psyched yesterday when you did n't come to take a chance on calling or going to see you in case I might like start screaming and really freak out , which was why I did n't as undoubtedlyyou know because you know everything .

If you know everything then you must be right it would have hurt worse to lay it on the line although I still ca n't visualize how anything could hurt worse . I was going to disappear silently like WHOOSH Away Soil and Toil on the TV only I was afraid ( and Linda agrees ) that if I did you might have some doubts later and get racked up which would be a bad development because the whole idea is for Brain Not To Be Hassled , to be always and more and more calm and productive and together  --  as much as anybody can be in this American Century  --  granted that . And to finish your book which will be a beautiful child for you and the world . Do n't regret anything not ever I do n't . I wanted to love completely and give my whole self to you and I got my wish not the way I thought but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all live many different lives and this one is over for me that 's all . I want to say besides , think of me some cold afternoons in your office but I know that 's an ego trip . Do n't think of me just remember how important what you are writing is and now nothing can get between you and it anymore . And take care of yourself. yours yours yours yours yoursBrian 's first reaction to this document is bewilderment , followed , as he reads on , by great vexation of spirit . How can Wendy have become pregnant ? Supposedly , she is on the pill ; " what it means that it happened " therefore is that she has lost her balance and carelessly , stupidly , fallen off the pill . Next he is angry at his own stupidity , for not having foreseen this , prevented it ; then again at her for not having told him , for having been so stupidly inarticulate . But after all , Wendy admits these faults . He reads her letter over again and is struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her generous refusal to blame or involve him . Believing that he knew what had happened , she has waited for him to speak . Since he has not , she accepts it . Withoutp105asking for anything , without making a scene , she declares her intention of leaving town , presumably to seek an abortion ( " I have to cope now " ) . For a moment he considers allowing the misunderstanding to continue , accepting her generosity silently and letting her go but only for a moment . To do that would be both morally and practically indefensible  --  both bad government and bad politics . Besides , he wants to see her . He must see her , must clear up the misunderstanding , assure himself of her emotional stability and continuing discretion , assure her of his continuing affection , his emotional and moral support  --  And his practical support . Legal operations cost a lot of money ; illegal ones , not covered by Blue Cross , cost even more . Brian can afford to replace Blue Cross , and it is right that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dials Wendy 's number , planning what he will say ( Why did n't you tell me  --  How could you have thought I  --  ) . The phone begins to ring . ( But there 's no need to break off your education , to drop out of school A short medical leave of absence  --  Mononucleosis is the usual cover story  --  ) The dead , even burr of a telephone sounding in an empty apartment ; three times , four , five . Has she left town already ? He sets the receiver back and begins to read Wendy 's letter for the third time . " Zed says we all live many different lives and this one is over for me that 's all " he reads ; " . . . disappear silently .. . The end of everything . . . " Brian half starts up from his desk , making the noise " Awff . " He controls himself , sits down again . He warns himself aloud not to leap to conclusions , while a voice located somewhere behind his left ear shouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frightful disaster is to be averted . He dials Wendy 's number again , while another voice at the top of his head remarks how in crisis even sophisticated , educated men employ the rhetoric of cheap political melodrama ; this fact has interesting historical applications , it remarks . Brr , brr , brr . But perhaps that was n't Wendy 's number . Brianp106replaces the receiver and consults a student directory . Though the figures appear to be the same , he dials them again , slowly , with fingers which feel swollen . Brr , brr , brr , brr , etc . All right , this is an emergency . He must think clearly , logically . If Wendy is not home , she might be somewhere on campus . Leaving a note on his door , he hastens out and spends the next half-hour in a rapid tour of the university , becoming , in spite of Wendy 's declared intention , progressively more and more uncalm and unproductive and apart . He looks for her in the reading room and in the library stacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campus store . He looks also for Linda , whom he has so often in the past tried to overlook . But he can not perceive them , though people in all these locations perceive him . Some of them stare at him , probably wondering what he is doing there . And what is he doing there ? If Wendy plans to kill herself , or even if she only plans to leave town , she is n't going to be reading in the reserve book room or eating one of her **28;1213;TOOLONG sandwiches in the Blue Cow . This evidence of his mental confusion makes Brian stumble on the steps of the library . He stops , tries to catch his breath . He must clarify his mind , review the situation as a whole , make a structural analysis , reject extraneous data . Here in Corinth , because of its unique geological history , the means of suicide are always at hand . Wherever claustrophobia for life strikes , you are seldom far from the easy way , the traditional Corinth University way , out . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the south , are most popular . But the cliffs are everywhere , and at this time of day more private . Every year a few unhappy students , in the local phrase , " gorge out . " If Wendy has already leaped into one of these deep , fatal cracks in the landscape , there is nothing to be done , Brian thinks as he stands on the library steps panting and sweating , though it is a cool , cloudy day . Nothing to be done even if she is now on her way ; there are too many possible spots , he could never find her . But she will be found , soon enough Found , identified , examined ;  |p107found  to be with child , his child . The tragic event will be reported as usual in two discreet paragraphs on an inner page of the Corinth Courier , read with supper tomorrow by everyone in town , by Erica . His denials . " I have n't seen her , spoken to her  --  hardly seen her , spoken to her " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm afraid , she was always somewhat unbalanced  --  " Unbalanced , fell easily . The event recorded at greater length , with a recent photograph , in the student paper , read with breakfast next day by everyone ; by Linda Sliski . Linda 's sorrow , her rage , her consciousness , the expansion of her consciousness into that of others , many others , expanding circles of others . " Good afternoon , " remarks a colleague , one George Chambers , passing Brian on his way into the library . " Mrm , " Brian replies , recalled to public awareness . He holds out his hand , palm up like a beggar , to give the impression that he has paused outside the library only for a moment , to test for rain . It is not raining , but looks threatening . A strong wind is blowing across the quad under dark , smoky , dirty-looking clouds . Rain is promised , lightning , thunder , hail . Automatically Brian begins to walk away from the library toward his office . Publicity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exemplary sensitivity , will no longer wish him a good afternoon , or any afternoon . Back at his office , panting and slightly giddy , as if he had just climbed a mountain instead of two flights of stairs , Brian again lifts the phone . He dials Wendy 's number and lets it ring , eleven times . As it rings he visualizes the apartment . He imagines the bathroom , which has pink walls , white tiles . The sink and tub are antique , rust-stained under the faucets . A razor blade rests on the rim of the tub , which is beginning to fill with blood , and with Wendy 's long pale hair . She has just cut her wrists , though inexpertly and perhaps not fatally ; but , leaning over the rim , she has already lost consciousness . Slamming his office behind him , Brian half walks , half runs through the building toward the faculty parking lot . Wendy 's apartment is on the second floor of an old framep108house in Collegetown . It is approached by way of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lined in red cabbage-rose wallpaper leading to a glassed door curtained inside with green burlap . Brian alternately knocks upon this door and shakes it by the cut-glass handle , calling out Wendy 's name and demanding that she let him in . No answer . He descends the stairs and goes outside , walking around the building and looking up at the windows of the apartment . It is hard to see anything , for the backyard is on a downward slope and littered with trees and drifts of leaves and rusted play equipment . Brian begins to climb the fire escape . Breathing hard after three flights , he draws level with Wendy 's bathroom . Between pink curtains he can see a corner of the mirror ; then as he climbs further some toothbrushes of varied colors . The sink . The empty tub . Of course , he thinks on the way down , Wendy would never cut her wrists ; she is afraid of blood . Standing in the yard , frowning up at the second floor , Brian suddenly sees in his mind right through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ; she is kneeling on the spatter-pattern linoleum , with her head inside the stove . The vision is so clear that he can even see the two metal racks which normally occupy the oven , and upon which Wendy has in the past broiled Swiss-cheese-and-tomato sandwiches for his lunch . To make room for her head , she has removed these racks and placed them against the wall . Brian hurries into the building again and up the cabbage-lined chute . Again he rattles the door handle , and shakes it . " Wendy ? " he shouts , several times . He tries to think of ways of breaking the door in  --  difficult because there is no landing  --  ways of breaking the glass panel . " Wendy ! " " What the hell 's going on up there ? " Glancing down , Brian sees in foreshortened perspective a bearded young man  --  the physics graduate student who lives in the downstairs apartment.  | " I 'm looking for Miss Gahaghan . " " She 's not there , she went out about an hour ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Sure I 'm sure . She had a suitcase with her . What 's the matter , you stoned or something ? I 'm trying to study . " Brian apologizes , thanks the young man , leaves the building . A suitcase , he repeats to himself half aloud . Certainly if you intend to kill yourself you do n't take a suitcase . He draws breath . Inside his head he can still see Wendy 's kitchen and the two stove racks leaning against the yellow wall , but Wendy has vanished . He can therefore look right into the oven and see what he must have known all along , that it is an electric oven . This evidence of mental confusion , warped memory , appalls Brian . He realizes by what a narrow margin he has been saved from smashing in the door of an empty student apartment ; from being discovered in this act , or just afterward , by the bearded young man . A suitcase . What Wendy intends , just as he had deduced at first from her letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls would do in her situation  --  that is , go home , to her parents in Queens . Brian gets into his car ; his pulse is returning to normal . All right . To reach New York , Wendy will probably have to take a bus , and to take a bus she will have to go to the bus station . He starts the car and drives across town , fighting an impulse to exceed the speed limit considerably . The Greyhound station is deserted except for one bored clerk who tells Brian grudgingly that the last bus for New York departed at noon too early for Wendy , who must have left her letter in his mailbox about that time . The next one leaves after three , nearly two hours from now . He has plenty of time . Standing in line at the bank , waiting to draw out six hundred dollars ( a sum suggested to him by recent articles in the Village Voice ) , Brian congratulates himself on the decision to keep his royalties and lecture fees in a separate account with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward he notices a sign urgingp110customers to Place Your Valuables in Our Vaults . Vaults ; Tombs ; Wombs . Wendy lying broken on wet rocks ; his name printed near hers in the newspaper . But he stamps these irrational fears down into the brown-patterned carpet , repeating to himself " Suitcase . . . Bus . " But if Wendy is still in town , where is she ? As he watches Mrs. Morrison telephoning some higher authority to learn if it is all right to give Brian Tate his own six hundred dollars , the hunch comes to him that she is at that occult bookstore , talking to the phony who runs it , telling him everything . Mrs. Morrison is still on the phone , listening , nodding . The figure , six hundred dollars in cash , has aroused suspicion . She too , or her superior at the other end of the line , has read the Village Voice ; they know . The phone is replaced . Is he sure he does n't want travelers checks ? They 're so much safer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the money , in tens and twenties unmarked bills , he hopes . She slides them through the gap in the bars , and Brian folds them into his wallet under her gaze . The Krishna Bookshop is located at the shabbier end of Main Street , between a Chinese restaurant and an office-supply store . From outside its appearance is drably exotic . The narrow dusty window , like Wendy 's day bed , is draped with a fading India-print spread , on which a large Oriental stone idol sits smiling faintly and smoothly . All around him books on occult subjects are haphazardlyplaced ; some standing , some lying , some leaning on one another , as in a partially ruined temple , a miniature Asian Stonehenge . Inside , the first impression is of dull light , crowded tall shelves , a dirty-sweetish smell of incense . Wendy is not in the room . At a high wooden counter on Brian 's right a boy with a skimpy beard is reading , in disregard of the sign on the wall behind him which proclaims in heavy black-script @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BE EXPRESSED IN WORDS , IT IS NOT THE TRUE WA YIn the corner to Brian 's left a girl in overalls is sitting crosslegged on the floor ; at the far back of the store two men are bent over some papers at a table . One is young and husky , with bushy black hair ; the other older and thinner  --  possibly the proprietor . Brian feels scorn rising toward disgust  --  an intensification of the political and strategic advantage he is aware of when entering any store . He is at a political advantage in these situations , like most customers , because he is socially anonymous , while the people in the store are defined , and defined as low-status clerks ; and at a special advantage here since he knows who Zed is , while Zed does not know him . He is at a strategic advantage because he can choose whether to buy or not , while they can not choose whether or not to sell ; and strategically invulnerable here , since there is nothing in this dingy place he wants . Except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor as the most normallookingof the lot , and moves toward her . " Excuse me , " he says . " I 'm looking for Wendy Gahaghan . Has she been here today ? " No answer . Brian raises his voice and repeats the question . Still no answer . The girl does not even look at Brian , though he is standing directly in front of her ; she looks through him . A thin , dizzy unease comes over him , a sensation of not being in the Krishna Bookshop , or anywhere . " Gail ca n't talk now , she 's doing her yoga , " remarks the boy at the counter . " Oh ; sorry . " Brian moves off , reminding himself that he is still in a state of tension . " You looking for Wendy ? " Brian admits this . " I have n't seen her . " He lowers The Zodiac and the Soul and calls , " Hey , Zed . Has Wendy been in today ? " At the rear of the shop the older man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd , startling effect like the switching on and off of a strong light . Then he shakes his head , turns back . " She might be in , if you want to hang around awhile , " the boy offers . " She usually comes in the afternoons . " Hanging around , Brian moves along one wall , reading the backs of books . Demonology Today . The Tarot Revealed . The very titles proclaim them full of lies , superstition , fear all that should have been destroyed for good by the philosophical and political enlightenment of the eighteenth century , the scientific and social enlightenment of the nineteenth , but is now crawling back into every corner . The sleep of reason produces monsters , and they are here , invisibly thick in this ill-lit room . That skinny drug addict has brought them here , and with their help he is living off Wendy and other innocent students , poisoning their minds , subverting everythingBrian and his colleagues have taught them . Wisdom of the Sufi . Psychic Self-Defense . The Book of the Dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoons , something she has concealed from him , is to Brian another proof that the demons of irrationality and self-destruction have their claws into her deeper than he knew . If she does destroy herself , this place must bear the guilt . Some of the guilt . He grimaces , moving along the wall of books . From time to time he glances with distaste at Zed 's back , or pats his jacket pocket , where the wallet stuffed full of bills still bulges and glows fluorescently . Presently there is movement at the back of the room . The heavy young man is getting up from the table , collecting papers covered with figures and diagrams , expressing gratitude . " Yeh , well , I 'd like to go along with you on that ; but you know those Mercury and Venus progressions never act much on me , " he remarks as he and Zed walk past Brian toward the door . " They do n't energize me like the Mars-Uranus aspects do . I guess violence is just my karma . " He laughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you later . " " Go in peace , Danny . " Zed shuts the door and slouches slowly back down the long ,  |p113narrow  book-lined room toward Brian . There is something uneasy , even threatening in the approach of this gangling figure , its face obscure against the back-light from the window . Brian 's hand goes protectively to his jacket pocket . But as Zed draws nearer and the musty glow from the ceiling fixture strikes him , the threat dissolves . He is revealed to be a weedy , nondescript middle-aged man ; tall , pale , balding , with blurry worn features . " Can I help you ? " Zed 's voice and manner are mild , almost shy . He is ill-dressed in a tired gray turtleneck sweater and sagging work pants , and looks ill-nourished , even unhealthy . " No thank you , " Brian says dismissively , relieved but rather surprised . From the reports of Wendy and other students he had expected something more than this slack , dim being  --  something more forcible , even formidable . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brian thinks , looking him over . A weak , small-town crank . He has wasted his time being jealous of this fellow ; Zed does n't look as if he 'd been able to get it up for years . It annoys him though that the proprietor of the Krishna Bookshop has not been definitely dismissed , but continues to hover about four feet off , not quite watching him , like an intrusive salesperson . " If you do n't object , that is , " he adds pointedly . " Oh no . We 're all waiting for somebody here , is n't that right , Tim ? " " That 's right . " An appreciative smile from the boy at the counter . Cheap profundity , Brian thinks to himself , not smiling . He moves away from Zed . Like that stare he gave me earlier : another trick . Anybody could do it ; I 've done it myself with students . It only affected me for a moment because I am in a state of tension . He looks out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Wendy is coming along the street . " I have n't seen you in here before , " Tim remarks conversationally , putting his book down and leaning forward . " That 's because I have n't been in here , " Brian replies . " Butp114I 've heard a lot about this place , " he adds somewhat more agreeably , wondering if and how he should ask what time Wendy usually comes in . " Oh yeh ? " Tim smiles . Zed shuffles slowly nearer . " And what have you heard ? " he asks . " Various things . " Brian frowns ; he has no wish to get involved in conversation , but wants to establish his position as a rationalist who has not the slightest interest in the wares of the shop . " For instance , I hear that you believe in devils , " he says , allowing a mocking overtone . Zed smiles . " It seems a mistake not to , given this world . " In other company Brian might laugh and concede the point , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh yes . " Zed has reached the counter now and leans on it with one frayed elbow . " And where is God , in this world ? " Zed sighs and looks directly at Brian . Again , the flash of light . " I think God is not very interested . " Though this in effect is what Brian himself thinks , that Zed should say it strikes him as phony . He glances out the window again impatiently ; surely if Wendy were coming she would be here by now . " I also heard you were doing a roaring business , " he says . Since he has been in the bookshop for twenty minutes and seen no sign of business , this is meant ironically , but Tim takes it straight . " People might say that , but it 's an illusion . We do n't make much bread ; he "  --  gesturing with his head  --  " gives too many books away . Besides , we get ripped off all the time . " " Ripped off ' ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the street , nor anyone . Only some bits of dirty newspaper are swept past by the hard wind . Perhaps she has left town by the early bus , or got a ride from someone . " Yeh . We lose a lot of books that way , maybe ten , fifteen ap115week . We could stop it  --  anyhow , cut it down . Only he does n't want to . " Tim laughs , looking at Zed . " I stop it sometimes , " he says . " It depends on the person . And the book . " Brian glances at his watch : two twenty-five . He decides to give her five minutes more . " Some people only feel good about something they 've stolen , " Zed continues . " That makes it really theirs . With others that does n't work . Like Wendy : she 'll only pay attention to a book if somebody she admires gives it to her . " He glances up at Brian ; another , though fainter , flash of light . This effect is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Zed has unusually pale eyes , of a watery gray which is almost white . " Or take Danny , who was just in here , " Zed adds . " I would n't give Danny any book I wanted him to read seriously . And I 'd stop him if he tried to lift one , because he 's the type that does n't value anything they have n't paid a good price for . For Danny , we should mark the books up . " He smiles and adds slowly , turning toward Brian , " A lot of Capricorns are that way . Like you . " Brian , who has been gazing out into the street , faces back . " And what makes you think I 'm a Capricorn ? " he asks . " I know you 're a Capricorn , " Zed says slowly , " because I know who you are . " Brian swallows and shifts his feet angrily . It is not only that his anonymity , his social advantage as a customer , has been destroyed . If this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wendy has explained him , described him . He has been exposed , betrayedhow fully exposed , he has not time to consider now . He recognizes an attack , and knows as a political scientist that the correct strategy is not to stop and analyze it , or even to defend himself , but to counterattack with any weapon handy . " There you have the advantage of me , " he therefore retorts . " I do n't even know your name . " A short pause . The opponents look at each other ; or rather ,  |p116Brian  looks at Zed , and Zed looks at a spot some inches to the east of Brian . " Why , this is Zed , " Tim offers cheerfully , gazing from one to the other like a small child who has never seen a machine gun . " He lives here ; he runs this place . " " Zed what ? " Ignoring Tim , Brian stares at the shabby , phony individual who knows whatever Wendy has told him . . . perhaps everything . " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you call yourself , " Brian says . Zed nods minimally . " What 's your real name ? " " You mean , what was my name before I came here ? " " Yeh . " " That 's the past . It 's irrelevant . " Defensive tactics , Brian thinks scornfully . " Not to me , " he insists . " I 'm a historian . " " History does n't interest me any more . " Zed smiles weakly but stubbornly . " It 's two-dimensional , and I 'm not interested in anything now below the fourth dimension . " Apparently a joke , since Tim laughs appreciatively . The noise of this laughter irritates Brian ; he rolls out his big guns . " He refuses to admit what his name is , " he says , speaking ostensibly to Tim . Silence . Then Zed looks up . " If you really want to know , " he says in a strained , pale voice , " I used to be called Sanford Finkelstein . " " Sanford Finkelstein , " Brian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knowledge heard the name before , he smiles  --  for the first time in two hours.  | " Sanford Finkelstein  --  " For the third time that day , and within the hour , this name is spoken in Corinth  --  a coincidence which Zed , had he known of it , might have attributed to the Law of Simultaneity as defined by Jung and other writers on the I Ching . It is spoken this time by Danielle Zimmern as she and Erica wait in line at the Blue Cow , the campus coffee shop . Danielle has heard the name herself only the day before , from an emeritus professor in her department : an elderly , gentlemanly scholar whose own name is Jack Shade . In his day , Professor Shade established a reputation for loyalty to the university and original research ; he retains both . Unlike so many of his former colleagues , he has not abandoned either Corinth or his intellectual interests upon retirement in favor of Florida and television . He remains in town , and the history and traditions of the university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaints of younger professors ) of the appearance in town of the Krishna Bookshop , Shade took the academically unprecedented but for him perfectly logical step of paying it a visit . He had inspected the premises , talked to several customers and finally , triumphantly , identified its proprietor as " one of our alumni indeed , as it turns out , a former student in my introductory course . " Shade 's satisfaction at this discovery , and at the spirit of local patriotism shown by Zed 's return to Corinth , quite overshadowed any doubts he might feel about the manner of this return . For Danielle too the significant fact about Zed 's name is that she has heard it before . It is , she believes , the name of a graduate student in philosophy nearly twenty years ago . " I wondered if it was the same guy I knew at Harvard , " she remarks to Erica , holding a Styrofoam cup under the coffee urn . " That tall , funny-looking man with the red hair that Ann Hershey used to go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ann did n't go out with Sandy Finkelstein , " Erica says , filling her cup in turn . " She went out with his roommate . But he did go to Corinth ; it could be the same one . " " He was studying philosophy . " Danielle moves along the counter toward the cashier , searching in her memory , and also in the side pocket of her briefcase for a dime . " And he played the piano , did n't he ? " " Yes ; quite well . " Erica shifts two heavy books on medieval Irish art and reaches into her shoulder bag . " Here , I have change . Let me pay . " " That 's all right , I 've found it . Yeh ; I remember him at some party at Lowell House . Everybody was dancing and he was playing . " The cashier rings up their money ; Danielle and Erica move on toward a counter where individual portions of cream and sugar are heaped in plastic bins . " Sanford Finkelstein , " Danielle repeats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is based on , in your books ? " " Well , I suppose in a way . " Erica smiles . " It was the name mostly . Sanford seemed like a good name for an ostrich . " " He looked sort of like an ostrich . Those long skinny legs and neck . And the way his red hair stuck up on top of his head . " Both women laugh . " If it 's really him , it 's funny he should come backp119here and run a crank bookshop . I thought he was teaching philosophy out in California somewhere . " " The last I heard , he was in Japan . " The coffee shop is crowded ; Erica and Danielle end up sitting on a window ledge . Danielle would have been content to share a table , but Erica prefers this , both because it affords more privacy and because it gives a better view of the room , thus furthering the real purpose which has brought her onto campus . " We ought to go down to that bookstore sometime and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , pouring a paper trapezoid of cream into her coffee . " Mm . " Erica stirs sugar into hers with a plastic stick . " Speaking of identifying people , " she adds . " Do you happen to notice that girl here ? " " What girl ? Oh . " Lowering her cup , Danielle scans the room . " No , I do n't see her . She was here the other day , though , " she adds unhelpfully . Erica controls a sigh of impatience . This is the third time in as many weeks that she has had coffee with Danielle in order to identify Brian 's nameless new mistress . Once she has seen her ( ideally , in Brian 's company ) she can confront him , and she is eager to confront him . The pleasure of being secretly in the right has worn thin for Erica over the past weeks . She is in the right , and Brian in the wrong , but he does n't know it , or rather he does n't know she knows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . And , in fact , as long as she does n't speak , he is getting away with something . Besides , concealing what she knows from Brian is a kind of lying , and Erica hates lies . She has sometimes told polite fibs , but she disapproves even of this , and avoids it when she can . She has not lied seriously since junior high . Therefore she has sought the girl , both in Danielle 's company and alone , even more conscientiously than she had hunted for Wendee last spring . Again her search has been vain , but this time for the opposite reason . The moon-faced graduate student she isp120seeking now , with her " stringy bleached hair " is as much uglier than the real Wendy Gahaghan as last spring 's quarry was more beautiful . But though she has n't been able to identify Brian 's mistress , Erica has plenty of circumstantial evidence of her existence . There is Brian 's continued air of uneasy , preoccupied self-righteousness ; his phony concern for his wife 's mental and moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her suspicions , keep her on the defensive , and cover his own guilt . There is his disinterest in making either love or serious conversation . Above all , there is the evidence of his new sideburns . To Erica 's knowledge , Brian has had hair on his face only once in his life before : in the summer of 1952 , when he grew a mustache while they were on Martha 's Vineyard . After a rather slow start it came in well : glossy , full , seal-brown . He took it back with him to Cambridge for the fall term , where his friends agreed with Erica that it made him look much older , and more serious . But three months later a student organization published a guide to freshman courses illustrated with caricatures of faculty members . In this guide , Brian appeared as a very small man attached to a very large mustache . Over the Christmas vaction he shaved it off . The mustache had been a deliberate effort ; the sideburns appeared deviously . Brian did not at any time declare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if on their own momentum  --  edging down the sides of his face a fraction of an inch at a time , like some geological formation . When they reached the level of his mouth they began to put out a sort of horizontal extension or spur on each cheek . They are an announcement to the whole world that Professor Tate wishes now to appear younger , and less serious  --  to be seen as a " swinger . " To Erica , their message is as plain as if her husband had been branded across the face : ADULTERER . " The vet was over again last night , " Danielle says , breaking into these thoughts . " Oh ? " " He turned up about nine-thirty , said he wanted to takep121another look at Roo 's sick turtle . But I do n't think that was what he really wanted . " " What did he want ? " Erica turns from contemplation of the entrance to the coffee shop , where Brian 's mistress might at any moment appear . " Sex , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made any move , or said anything . He just sat there drinking beer and telling me animal stories for a couple of hours . But he kept looking at me . You know how it is  --  you can usually tell . " " Mm . " " Of course I suppose he 's lonely too . His wife died last year ; or passed away ' as he puts it . He practically never talks about her . I guess it still hurts him a lot . And both his sons have left home , and all his friends are respectably married . I feel sorry for him in a way . I mean , he 's a nice guy , and not bad-looking , if he were n't so dumb and slow . I feel like I ought to tell him he 's wasting his time at my house barking up the wrong tree , to use his phrase . He ought to go after one of these hot little bitches who are just asking for it , like my husband always did . " Danielle smiles sourly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Reminded , Erica looks again toward the door , in case a pudding-faced bleached blonde of the sort who is just asking for it should enter . Then she looks back at her friend , frowning slightly . Ever since the separation she has followed Danielle 's emotional life with anxious concern . First , directly after Leonard moved out , there was a period of stunned despair . This was followed by several months of flagrant and indiscriminate misbehaviorwith an overlapping series of unsuitable men . ( Erica and Brian had divided them into two types : Scavengers and Weaklings . I'he former were like those gulls which follow in the wake of large departing ships , where it is traditionally easy to pick up leavings ; the latter of the doglike variety , drawn to any woman who recently belonged to a successful man by the magical belief that if they rub against her some of his power , his mana , will rub off on them . ) This period was especially hard on Erica , who found it difficult to hidep122her disapproval when she dropped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or worse , knew quite well in a position of temporary intimacy . Finally , there was a long , severe reaction . Danielle was " through with all that , thank God , " as she declared many times with a stoic grin which made Erica want to weep  --  or possibly go to New York on the next plane and assassinate Leonard Zimmern . If she could help it , Danielle announced , she was n't going to have anything to do with love , or men , or any of that garbage , for the rest of her life . ( " If it really starts bothering me , I can always masturbate . " ) This dismal state of mind , which shows no sign of letting up , has lasted nearly a year . " I think he has some idea that I might come across because I 'm so weird by his standards . I mean , I 'm forty-one , but I have long hair and wear arty clothes and I read books in foreign languages , so I might do anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-laugh . You 're kind of a hippie , are n't you ? ' he said to me last night . I did n't know that when I saw you up at the clinic . The way girls dress these days , you ca n't tell them apart . ' " " You know , that 's true , " Erica says , looking around the Blue Cow again . " It 's not like when we were in college . When somebody wore jeans and no make-up , instead of the standard plaid skirt and sweaters , and did n't have her hair set , you knew instantly that she was one of us . " " That 's right . " Danielle drains her coffee cup and sets it down . " It was the men you could n't tell apart then . They all had short hair and button-down shirts and chino pants . You had to talk to them to find out if they were interesting , or kind of spooko , or just club boys or sheep . " She smiles reminiscently , and so does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly how antiestablishment my male students are by the length of their hair ; but the girls all look alike , whether they 're Delta Jello or SDS . " Yes , Erica thinks as she backs her car out of the lot and startsp123home , it was different then . Better . But it is n't quite true that all the men looked alike . Sandy Finkelstein , for instance , who is now possibly in Corinth  --  there was always something peculiar about him . He wore ordinary clothes , but they never fit right , perhaps because he was so thin . His pants flapped around his legs , his socks sagged , and his shirts ballooned and fluttered in the slightest breeze , as did his untidy red hair . She remembers him best in Greek class , struggling over sight translations in a room on the third floor of Sever Hall , raising his pale eyes to the ceiling in a pantomime of despair . After class Erica occasionally had coffee with him on Mass . Avenue ; and once Sandy , who was rather pathetically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear The Magic Flute . At the end of that year he left Cambridge , but he came back now and then for a visit . He had been at her wedding on one of those trips ; not that she 'd invited him , but somebody had brought him along . He was rather sweet , really , Sandy  --  amusing to talk to , and intelligent  --  but sort of a lost soul even then . It was n't so surprising that he should end up out of a job , involved in Eastern mystical nonsense . But it was a little sad . Erica turns north at the edge of campus onto the main road . A hard , high wind is blowing across it , shifting banks of cold-looking clouds . The last she 'd heard of Sandy was a picture postcard of some Japanese temple ; a shiny color photograph  --  on the reverse no address , no message , only his name and a haiku he 'd copied out , something about crickets . That was several years ago . . . three , four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly here , or forwarded from Cambridge . In other words , does Sandy know the Tates are in Corinth ? Were it anyone else she would have assumed not ; otherwise they would have called . But with Sandy you could n't be sure especially if he has turned into some kind of superstitious eccentric . If she goes to the bookstore with Danielle , and it really is Sandy , then she will have to invite him to the house , to dinner , whatever he has turned into . But there is no need to do it instantly.  |p124Next  week would be soon enough , or next month . If he has joined one of those vegetarian religions , it means a special meal , too . Well , that egg curry from the United Nations cookbook is quite good , with walnuts and chutney . Danielle can come , though Brian will not like that ; nor will he like the vegetarian curry . He always demands meat for dinner . And Sandy himself will probably annoy Brian , or at least bore him . But perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little . And when you learn that an old friend is in town , the right thing to do is invite him to dinner , for instance next weekend . Out on Jones Creek Road the wind is blowing even harder , scraping down the grass in the fields , pulling the few remaining wrinkled leaves from the oaks . As Erica comes up the hill past the latest Glenview Homes , which always look particularly exposed and vulgar from now until the first snowfall , she sees that there is someone , a young girl , sitting on the top step of her front porch next to two suitcases . From her attitude body huddled against the wind beside a post , head down , eyes shut  --  it appears that she has been sitting there a long time ; or is very cold , or very tired , or both . As Erica 's car enters the driveway , however , the girl hears it , and sits upright . Erica turns off the ignition and sets the brake . Her thought is that this person is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone in a Glenview Home . Her suitcases , which are of molded plastic , pinkish tan , suggest this . She has yellow hair , most of which is pulled into braids that hang limply on either side of a round , ordinary Glenview Homes sort of face , while escaped shreds blow across it . Erica gets out of the car with her books , and walks around it . " Can I help you ? " she asks in a neutral , pleasant voice . Slowly , the girl stands up . She is short  --  hardly taller than Erica though she stands a step higher  --  and not quite as young as she first looked . Her eyes are red-rimmed , worn , as though she had a bad cold , or had been weeping . " Are you Mrs. Tate ? "  | " Yes . " Erica smiles encouragingly , not puzzled , since thename is within view , painted by her in script on their mailbox . " Mrs. Brian Tate ? " she repeats , with a sort of tired eagerness . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologize to you , before I leave town . I 'm Wendy Gahaghan . " " Wendy Gahaghan ? " Erica shields her chest with the facsimile edition of the Book of Kells . Wendee ? But she 's not beautiful ; not even terribly pretty . She 's just ordinary . " Uh huh . . . You know who I am ? " " Yes . " Erica has a sense of speaking with difficulty , through her teeth . " I know all about it . " She grips the books tighter . It is for this limp , snuffly , ordinary girl that Brian has behaved so atrociously , caused so much pain , so much rage ! Wendy looks at her blankly , waiting ; it is not clear for what . If she is to be scolded , insulted , even struck , her stance suggests , she will not have the energy to defend herself . Her head hangs sideways . You miserable , cheap , nondescript But Erica has not been brought up to insult strangers ; she can not voice the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be jumping back into the wrong-hole . Wendy came here at last to apologize , and I " You 'd better come inside , " she says . Awkwardly , she holds open both the screen door and the front door , while Wendy , weighed down lopsidedly with suitcases , plods past her , and stands dumbly in the hall . " In here . " Erica leads Wendy toward the sitting room , where last night 's paper still lies on the sofa , and the curtains are due to he cleaned . The kitchen , where she usually sits with Danielle and other friends , is tidier ; but Wendy is not a friend , and probably will not notice anyhow . Abandoning her suitcases in the middle of the rug , Wendy takes the nearest chair , which happens to be Brian 's  --  something she could not have known , but which makes Erica shiver nevertheless . I must not be mean or hysterical , I must behave well and do the right thing , Erica tells herself , sitting down formally oppositep126Wendy on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . A pause ; but she is not obliged to break it . " I 'm not going to take up that much of your time , " Wendy finally begins , moving forward to the extreme edge of Brian 's chair as if to demonstrate this . " All I wanted to tell you is , I 'm sorry for the hassle I 've caused around here . " She takes a breath . " Yes , " Erica says neutrally . Since she will probably never see her again , she is cataloging Wendy 's appearance for future reference : pale round face , conventional childish features , bitten nails . " I mean , it 's racked me up all along what I was laying on you , somebody I never even met , you know ? " Wendy 's hands are clutched together in her lap ; her voice is high , uncertain . A faint New York accent  --  lower-middle-class . " I used to think how you were living right here in town and you knew all about it . And if you wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get me thrown out of school . Or you could come over someday and shoot me . Only you never did , you know ? " Wendy 's voice catches again . Erica realizes she is not merely guilty and nervous , as she ought to be , but actually frightened . " No , " she agrees , trying to ease the tension a little . " It never occurred to me . " " I mean , what I did to you , it was shitty . Some of the professors around here , their wives probably would n't give a damn . But BRIAN . " She pronounces his name with a special exhalation of air , of awe . " I mean , if you did shoot me , everybody who knew him would say , Well , okay , ' you know ? " The idea that Brian is of such unique importance and value that infringement of rights in him would justify murder annoys Erica profoundly , although ( or even because ) she might have subscribed to it in the past . Naturally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how to shoot anyone , " she merely says , smiling briefly . Wendy smiles back ; her smile is timid , grateful . She has small uneven white teeth , like a child.  | " The other thing I wanted to say , it 's that you should n't blame Brian . " She takes another breath . " I mean the , uh , you know , relationship was n't his idea . I like persecuted him into it . If it was n't for that , I bet he would n't have ever got off with any chick . " " Perhaps , " Erica says , thinking that Wendy is deceived , for Brian is off with another chick even now , and one reportedly much inferior to her . Her defense does not persuade Erica of Brian 's relative innocence , but rather the reverse . It demonstrates that Brian had not only seduced this girl last spring , but had somehow managed to convince her that it was all her fault . Just as he has so often tried to convince Erica that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will tell him . I had a visitor today , she will remark calmly after supper tonight , when the children are out of the way , when Brian is fed , relaxed and expecting no unpleasantness . Who do you think it was ? she will ask . A visitor to lunch . And then bring up the other one , because it is time for that . Yes . " Look , " she says aloud , speaking for the first time in a normal conversational voice . " Would you like a cup of coffee ? Or something to eat , perhaps . Have you had lunch ? " " Oh no , no thank you . " Wendy looks frightened again ; can she suspect that Erica , having neglected to shoot her , now intends to poison her ? " I have n't eaten lunch yet myself , " Erica continues reassuringly , standing up . " I 'm going to make myself a tunafish sandwich , and you could have one too if you like . " " No thanks , really . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she adds , trailing Erica toward the kitchen . " You hafta believe me , you know . I mean about Brian . That he 's not responsible . " " Brian is a grown man , " Erica says , opening the refrigerator to remove milk , lettuce and a bowl of tunafish-salad mix ; and shutting it again with the emphasis her tone lacks . " But it was my fault really . For months I kept coming around to his office , and he always was n't having any . He tried to help me get over it , he was beautiful about it , and so patient and intelligent ,  |p128well  you know how he is , but I could n't . I just cried all the time and kept saying how I was going to have a nervous breakdown if he did n't love me . " " I see , " Erica remarks , rinsing two pieces of lettuce in the sink under an unnecessarily hard flow of water . " But that was straight , you know , " Wendy insists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She makes the gesture of someone exhausted or insane flipping a pancake , in demonstration . " I was really flaky . " Erica takes a loaf of whole-grain rye bread out of the bread drawer . " I 'm not getting across to you , " Wendy says anxiously . " You 're not listening to me ; you 're just angry . " " I 'm not angry at you , " Erica corrects , opening the mayonnaisejar . " I think it 's very honest and decent of you to come and see me like this . " In her head , she contrasts the natural whole-grain honesty and decency of Wendy 's conduct , her willingness to accept blame , with the slippery opaque homogenized mayonnaise behaviorof Brian . " I had to , because I probably wo n't be back here for a long while . " Wendy shrugs wearily , and leans against a cupboard . Her raincoat has fallen open ; under it she is wearing a leather vest and skirt trimmed with long untidy leather fringe . " You 're leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to Brian , Wendy had already left town in June . Either he has neglected to mention that she has returned for a visit ( by the look of the suitcases , a lengthy visit ) or he does not know it . " Yeh . I hope it 's for good . " Wendy grins , sighs . " I 'm taking the bus to New York this afternoon . " " Ah . " In all their years here Erica and Brian have never used the bus , which takes six uncomfortable hours to reach New York , but always a car or the more rapid and expensive plane . " Have you seen Brian ? " " No ; not since Monday . He does n't want to see me again . " " But he knows you 're going to New York ? " " He knows I 'm splitting . " Wendy 's voice rises and wobbles as if she were going to cry . " It 's what he wants . "  |p129S|plitting  = leaving town , Erica translates . But Wendy also appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fringed and shredded clothes are the visible sign . Though Brian has long since lost interest in this miserable girl , she still has a crush on him  --  is even now being cut into shreds and torn apart by this crush . " And do you want to leave town ? " she asks , trying to speak gently . " I hafta leave town . " Wendy gasps , swallows . " Not just on account of what 's happened , but if I stay I know I 'll hassle Brian and keep him from working on The Book . That 's the really heavy thing . " " How do you mean , heavy ? " Erica arranges her sandwich on a willow-pattern plate . " You know  --  serious . Important . I mean , compared to The Book , none of us are important , you know ? Not even Brian , maybe . " " I do n't think I follow you , " Erica says , turning up the flame under the coffee pot . " You know his book , on American foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have n't read any of it yet . " " But you know what it 's about , and that he 's going to show how this really beautiful plan Kennan had after World War II was shucked because of selfish establishment politics and intrigues . He 's going to explain the whole thing , and if The Book is published in time , and the right people in Washington read it , it 's going to really zap them . And that could have a fantastic effect , you know ? Like once they realize what happened before , they would reverse their strategy , and stop trashing the rest of the world . " She looks at Erica with absolute , almost hysterical sincerity . " There 's no way of predicting for sure , but it could happen , you know ? " " I suppose possibly it could , " Erica admits , wishing that Wendy would stop asking her if she knows things . " Well , then . Say The Book was n't finished , and so our policy was n't changed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad to see Brian and get fucked ? " Erica flinches at the term ;  |p130Wendy  , not noticing , moves nearer , gazing at her with intensity . " I mean , what I believe is if you really love somebody you hafta want what 's right for them irrespective of if it hurts you personally . Like what my roommate Linda says about Madagascar . The way you know you really love a guy is , suppose he was to get a telegram saying he could have whatever he wants most in the world if he would move to Madagascar , and suppose you got this telegram first . Would you rip it up and destroy his future , or would you give it to him ? " " Mm , " Erica says , moving back from this outburst . " It 'll be easier for you both if you 're in New York , " she says , trying to speak in a calming voice . " It 's like the only way . I mean , we both realize if I 'm here I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that already last summer . I swear to stay away but then I get racked up about something and telephone , you know ? Or I freak out completely and go to the office . And even when I 'm seeing him it 's no good : I want to see him more , all the time , and there 's bad scenes , like last month in the coffee shop . It 's a bummer , really . " Reminded by the word " coffee , " Erica turns off the flame under the pot , pours a cup , and sits down at the kitchen table . But she is also reminded of something else . Coffee shop . Last month . Last summer . A few moments ago she had a vision of Wendy as splitting , torn apart . Now , instead , she begins to see her as several figures coalescing . It is as if she , Erica , had been stunned or drunk for months and was just coming out of it . Like a cartoon character she sits frowning , watching the stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The beautiful blonde she was seeking last spring ; the pudding-faced ugly one she has sought all fall ; and the weary , overwrought young girl who now stands in her kitchen  --  can they all be the same person ? Erica shakes her head slowly , to clear it , and looks at the single image . " Let me ask you something , " she says , speaking carefully . " Are you a psychology graduate student ? " Wendy takes a moment to register this . " I guess not , not anyp131more , " she says then , looking at Erica with a dazed , bitter expression . " I did n't tell them yet , but starting today I guess I 'm just a grad-school dropout . " Returning to consciousness , the animated-cartoon cat sees her several vibrating , threatening enemies reduced to one small , almost pathetic mouse  --  a mouse who has taken her request for information as a catty remark . Brian has had only one affair , and that affair is now over . Both Erica 's invisible rivals are simultaneously defeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : generous , modest , charming . ( She is a less good loser , but fortunately she has seldom since childhood been in that position . ) She realizes that she does not wish to cause Wendy any more pain than she is obviously suffering now  --  that she is in fact sorry for her . " I 'm sorry , " she says . " I did n't mean  --  Listen , please , Wendy . If you do n't want any lunch , at least sit down . You look exhausted . " " I am sorta spaced out . " The mouse slumps into a kitchen chair . " I did n't sleep last night . I figure maybe I 'll get some sleep on the bus . " " Are you going home ? " " Uh uh . Not right away . Ma 'd be too psyched if I was to just walk in and tell her I quit school and the whole bit . She comes on enlightened , but she 's really a pretty square type . I 'm going to stay with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lend me some money . And I 'll try to get some kind of job when this hassle is over . " Wendy puts a hand on her stomach and grins oddly . " Then maybe I 'll break the bad news to Ma . " " Mm , " Erica says , not listening , trying to arrange her new information . All this time , Brian has had only one affair ; but he has had it all this time . When he promised to end it last spring , when he said it was over , he was lying . Only now , only since Monday in fact , is it really finished . And when he blamed her for still brooding about it , last summer ; when he wondered audibly if she was mentally unbalanced , this fall  --  Erica feels as if she were beingp132poured full of boiling soup ; a hot furious bubbling and trembling in her chest and arms . What lies Brian has told , what hypocritical pomposity he has shown ; what guilt , what awful waste of energy and feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past about his affair begin to return . " It meant nothing . . . I do n't think about it . . . It just was n't that important . " To him , that is . To Wendy it was important , painfully important and still is , though Brian evidently is tired of her . " Why do n't you have a cup of coffee , " she suggests gently . " Well . Okay . I mean if it 's no trouble . " " Would you like sugar ? Cream ? " " Everything you 've got , please . " Erica sets her blue enamel sugarbowl and cream pitcher before Wendy , who proceeds to dilute her coffee into a sort of hot ice-cream soda ; perhaps it is more comforting that way . And Wendy obviously needs comfort . Brian has refused to see her any more ; he is tired of the feelings he has aroused in her . In order that he need not be reminded of them , Wendy is leaving town , dropping out of college . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurs to Erica , with a black bitterness like her own coffee , that twice this autumn Brian has separated women from their chosen work , merely for the sake of his own selfish male convenience and peace of mind . First , through emotional and moral blackmail , he prevented her from taking that job in the psychology department . Now , presumably by the same means , he is forcing Wendy to leave graduate school . " Do you really have to quit school right now , " she asks , sitting down again . " The term 's only half finished . You 'll lose credit for your courses . " " Yeh , " Wendy agrees dully . " Ca n't you wait until the end of the semester ? Till Christmas , at least . " " Uh uh . " Wendy shakes her head . " I should , maybe ; I thought about it , but I know I 'm not strong enough to stay here withoutp133bugging him . Anyhow I ca n't afford it now . " She takes a breath , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picks up her tunafish sandwich , looks at it , and puts it down . Rage at Brian , who has caused this collapse , pity for herself and for Wendy , rise in her throat , almost choking her . " Please , have some of my sandwich , " she says , moving her plate across the kitchen table toward Wendy . " I better not . . . Well ; if you 're sure you do n't want it . . Thanks . " She smiles weakly , childishly . " You 're welcome . " Erica smiles back . She thinks that she is behaving rather well to Wendy ; better than Brian has behaved . Brian has acted very wrongly , with deliberate and unprincipled selfishness . This idea does not completely displease her . In a husband , active is always preferable to passive misbehavior . It is not nice to think that Brian has callously and casually seduced and then rejected Wendy , but what is the alternative ? The alternative is to think of him as a passive victim of circumstances , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad pale little girls . " You know , you 're a lot different from what I expected , " Wendy remarks , looking up from her coffee . " Oh ? How ? " " I thought you 'd be much  --  I do n't know bigger and madder . " She takes another bite of sandwich . " I mean , you know , I used to wonder all the time about what you were like . Brian would never rap with me about you . The only data he ever gave out was that you were taller than him . And then one time he was telling me about some fraternity party where these boozed-up guys knocked over a punch bowl on you , and it sounded like you never even lost your cool . So I got this idea you were some kind of frozen lady giant eight feet high . " " I see . " Erica begins on her own sandwich . " I thought of you as rather formidable too , " she says . " Really ? That 's pretty funny . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess you 're the first person who ever . . . thought that . Mostly " She slows , then stops speaking , drops the crusts of herp134sandwich , and puts her hand on her stomach with an expression of great unease . " Are you all right ? " " I d'know . " Wendy shoves her chair back and stands up . " I guess maybe not . I better " She looks around the kitchen , takes two steps toward the door , another step back . " Uh  --  Ca n't  --  " Bending suddenly over the drainboard , she throws up into Erica 's kitchen sink , at first in a continuous loud rush , then more intermittently , punctuated with choking gasps of apology . " Oh , shit Jesus , I 'm sorry  --  " Erica stands a few feet off , wincing as her whole-grain bread , lettuce , tunafish salad , coffee and cream reappear in the sink , much the worse for wear . I have poisoned her just as she feared somehow , magically , she thinks . But how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distantly several times . Slowly , Wendy leaves off and straightens up , still holding on to the sink . Erica hands her some paper towels , and then a garbage bag ; finally she removes the drain basket from the sink and turns on the hot water hard . " God , how gross . Hey , I 'm really sorry , " Wendy says , looking at Erica like a sick puppy . " That 's all right . " Erica puts the top back on the trash can . " How do you feel now ? Would you like to lie down for a bit ? " " Well . Okay , for a couple minutes , maybe I better , " Wendy says blurrily . Leaving go of the sink , she staggers after Erica into the sitting room . " Wow . I 'm really dizzy . " She slumps onto the sofa and collapses sideways in a small heap . Erica hands her a pillow ; then she unfolds the crocheted afghan from the rocker and covers Wendy with an elaborate pattern of blue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have eaten that sandwich , " Wendy says meanwhile . " How could I be so stupid , stupid , stupid ! " She hits her forehead weakly with one fist . " I do n't see how it could be the sandwich , " Erica defendsp135herself . " I had the other half myself , and I do n't feel ill . Unless you 're allergic to fish . " " It 's not that . Anything would have done it , the way I am now . " " Mmhm , " Erica murmurs sympathetically , though the phrase which has begun to run through her head is hysterical psychosomatic vomiting . " Of course this is a difficult time for you . " Perhaps Wendy ought not to go to friends in New Jersey . Perhaps instead she should go home to her family and a good psychiatrist . " Yeh . It 's really been a bummer , these last couple weeks . I mean I thought , All right , morning sickness ; I can hack it until I get to the city . Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You . Have . Morning . Sickness , " Erica hears herself say in a very cool high voice , the voice of an ice giantess eight feet tall . " So-called . With me it 's not so bad in the morning . It starts about noon and lasts like practically till bedtime . Did you ever have that ? " " No . Not . Really , " replies the high voice . " You 'd better rest for a while now , " it adds , with what strikes Erica as great aplomb . " And I think I 'll go and finish my lunch . " " Okay . " Wendy closes her eyes obediently . For a moment Erica stands looking at her . " You 're sure you 're pregnant , I suppose , " she says . Wendy opens her eyes . " Sometimes people imagine " " Yeh , I 'm sure . I had a test at the clinic . You know , that test where they kill the rabbit . " She shuts her eyes again ; then she pulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it , disappearing completely . A casual observer might not have suspectedthere was anyone but Erica in the room , were it not for the two dull-pink plastic suitcases , still standing in the center of the rug where Wendy had dropped them  --  how long ago ? Walking carefully around the suitcases , Erica returns to the kitchen , where she is surprised to find it is not yet two o'clock . She finishes her lunch by pouring the coffee down the sink and puttingp136the remains of her sandwich into the garbage . Then she sits down , rests her chin on her hand , and tries to order her ideas , which are now tangled together like frozen garden hose , or one of those complicated designs knitted out of snakes in the Book of Kells . Wendy is one person , not three . Wendy is here , in her house . Wendy is pregnant . This last idea explains several things : why Wendy threw up into the kitchen sink , why she is leaving Corinth , and why she needs money . It shocks Erica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brian Tate , that serious , righteous man , that well-known liberal professor and household moralist , has knowinglyand deliberately seduced , impregnated , and abandoned a child . Wendy is leaving town . Wendy is going to Jersey City , where a friend will lend her money . Now a new , terrible idea strikes Erica . She thinks that Brian has not only seduced and abandoned Wendy , he has in effect delivered her into the hands of a Jersey City abortionist . She recalls horror articles in Brian 's Village Voice in which that very city was mentioned as a center of the illegal abortion racket ; descriptions of filthy makeshift operating rooms , bloodstained tables ; callous and venial doctors whose names have been struck from the Medical Register because of drink or drugs . But this can not be allowed to happen . It must be stopped . If it is not stopped , in a few days Wendy may be lying dead in some slum cellar or alley . Wendy must not be allowed to go to New Jersey . Probably she ought not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good , trustworthy , sympathetic doctor has been found to help her . But who is going to find such a doctor , and how ? And where is Wendy going to stay meanwhile ? Who is going to take care of her ? Her Ma is apparently no use ; and it is clear that Brian has nop137intention of taking any responsibility ; that he has made no move to do the decent , civilized , generous , right thing . Erica looks out of her kitchen window . The strong cold wind is still blowing , bending the trees between her yard and that of the new Glenview Home next door . Heavy flat clouds slide by rapidly , slate-gray , smoke-gray . Time is passing , and somebody must do something . She , Erica , must do something . She must do the right thing.  |p138THREE  TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS1 . " Hello . " " Mrs. Tate ? This is Dr. Bunch . " " Oh , hello , Dr. Bunch . I wanted to see you , but your nurse said you were going away this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't really know him , and the problem is . . . Well , the problem is we have a friend , a graduate student at the university ; it 's her I 'm calling about actually . You see , she 's in trouble . " " Trouble ? What type of trouble ? " " I mean , she 's found out she 's pregnant . . . And she 's just terribly unhappy about it . You see , she 's studying for a degree , and if she has a baby she 'll have to leave school , and her whole future will be disrupted . So she came to me , today , and I thought you might have some idea about what she could do . You might know where someone in her condition could go , or someone who could help her . " " Hm . Well . Has this pregnancy actually been medically confirmed ? "  | " Oh yes . She 's had a test . With a rabbit  --  " " Hm . Of course this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's very  --  " "  --  and probably there has n't been time for you to seriously consider how very wrong , not to say hazardous  --  " " I know it 's hazardous , Dr. Bunch ; that 's the whole reason I 'm calling you . You see I have to find someone decent and competent to help her , because if I do n't she 'll probably go to some awful quack abortionist in Jersey City or somewhere , she might do anything , really , she 's so depressed , so exhausted , miserable  --  " " How old are you , Erica ? " " Forty , last month , but I do n't see  --  " " And how many children do you and Professor Tate have ? " " Two . I know what you 're going to say , you 're going to say that this child deserves to be born as much as they did . But when a child is unwanted , when it just interferes with everyone 's life  --  " " Please listen to me for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . You and your husband have a secure income and only two children . You 're upset now about this pregnancy , you think that you do n't want another baby , perhaps that you 're too old  --  " " But I 'm not " "  --  or possibly your husband does n't want it  --  " " Dr. Bunch , it is n't  --  " "  --  or both of you , but believe me , I 've seen many cases of this kind , and in my experience these late children , these little afterthoughts ' as I call them , are often in the end the greatest source of satisfaction of all to both parents . Now , I suggest that you make an appointment for next week with my  --  " " Dr. Bunch , listen ! You think it 's me who 's pregnant , but I 'm not , really . It 's this student  --  " " If it 's a student , why does n't she go to the Corinth clinic ? " " Because they wo n't help her at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they  --  " " If you 're not personally concerned , Mrs. Tate , I frankly don'tp140understand why you would want to involve yourself in something like this . Abortion is not only against the law in this country , it 's a serious crime , and you 're proposing to make yourself an accessory to a crime . Why should you take any such responsibility ? This student , if she exists , must have a family , friends And how about the father ? Is n't he able to help ? Would he be willing for example to marry her ? Who is the father ? " " What ? " " Who is the father of this baby ? " " Uh I do n't know him . I mean the girl , my friend , does n't know who the father is . It might be anyone of several people ; students , you know . There 's nobody she can really go to , except for money that is . I mean you do n't have to worry about that , about money . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're asking me to perform an illegal operation , is that right ? " " I 'm not asking you to perform it . I 'm just asking you to recommend " " Mrs. Tate . In my eighteen years of practice , nineteen next July first , I 've had many , many patients come to me with this same problem . Most of them have claimed they were just asking for a recommendation , and almost all of them begin by saying they are inquiring for a friend  --  " " Dr. Bunch  --  " "  --  when it is quite obvious to me from everything they say that there is no friend . ' Do you have any tranquilizers in the house now , Erica ? " " No , I  --  " " Well then , I 'm going to write a little prescription for you ; I 'll call it in to the Country Corners Drugstore , and it should be ready for you to pick up in about an hour . I want you to take one every four hours ; and then tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're calmer , you can telephone this office and make an appointment for next  --  " " But I 'm already myself . I do n't need a tranquilizer , I 'm quitep141tranquil , considering everything , but I 'm honestly not expecting a  --  " " I ca n't discuss this matter any more with you , Erica . I have other patients waiting . " " But , Dr. Bunch ! " " Good-bye , then . Do n't forget to pick up that prescription . " 2 . " Brian Tate here . " " I 've been trying to reach you all afternoon . Where have you been ? " " I was out of the office . What is it ? Is something the matter ? " " You 're asking me if something is the matter ? That 's funny , really . " " Erica , please . I 've had a difficult day . Tell me what you called about , if it ca n't wait until I get home . " " It ca n't wait , because you 're not coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you about , to tell you not to come here . I 've packed your Gladstone bag , I put in two shirts and an extra pair of slacks and " " What do you mean , you packed " "  --  and your shaving things and some underwear , and I already took it up and left it in the office with Mrs. Wells . I told her you were leaving town and you would pick it up later . " " Now wait a moment . What do you mean , leaving town ? I 'm not going anywhere until the APSA meetings next month . " " I do n't care where you 're going . I do n't care anything about you , or what you do any more , I just do n't want you to come here , that 's all . " " Now listen , Erica . Try to get control of yourself  --  " " I have got control of myself . I 've got a good deal more control of myself than " " Erica , look , I 'm leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as "  | " If you come anywhere near this house , I 'm going to tell The Children everything you 've done . " " The Children , what do you mean , tell  --  " " Because I think they 're old enough to know . And please do n't start again on the apologies and excuses . Do n't tell me this time how important I am to you and how I have to learn to forget and forgive and not act irrationally and brood about events in another less important separate area of your life which did n't mean anything . I 've heard enough of your political speeches , and so has Wendy . " " Wendy ? " " Yes , Wendy . In case you want to know , she came to lunch here today . " " Oh , hell . " " You did n't think she would do that , did you ? You thought she would just get out of Corinth quietly and obediently , not asking for anything , not blaming you for what you 've done to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , that 's what 's so awful , and terrible . " " Wendy was there at the house ? When did she leave ? Was she going to New York ? " " No , to New Jersey . " " New Jersey ? " " Yes , she has friends there . You mean you did n't even know where she was going ? " " No , I  --  " " And you did n't care . You thought you could throw her out like an old pair of pajamas you were through sleeping in , and you were n't going to concern yourself with where she went or what happened to her . You did n't care whether she might be dead by this time next week . " " Dead ! What do you mean , dead ? " " And do n't bother to put on that concerned public voice . You know quite well what I mean . You know what the statistics are on illegal operations in Jersey City , you read that article in the Villagep143Voice , but you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations and does n't bother you any more , you do n't care . " " That 's not true . I 've spent all afternoon trying to find Wendy , trying to help her . I 've been at the bank taking out money , I 've been to the bus station , to her apartment , and all over town , all over the campus looking for her , calling her friends , for Christ 's sake , I 've been doing everything I can  --  " " Everything you can ? You want me to believe that for months you 've used this girl like a pair of dirty pajamas , and now , suddenly , today  --  " " Erica , please listen to me ! I did n't know about any of this until today . I did n't know Wendy was pregnant until I got a letter from her at the office , this noon . " " You 'll excuse me if I do n't believe that . " " Well it 's true , whether you believe it or not . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her idea , I did n't know anything about her plans , I did n't think she was going to go to you and make trouble  --  " " Wendy did n't come here to make trouble . She came because she wanted to apologize to me , because she at least has some sense of guilt , some sense of decency , and since she thought I already knew all about her  --  " " How could she think that ? I never said anything that could make her think  --  At least , not since last spring . Erica , listen . I 'm coming home now , and we can work out  --  " " I do n't want to work out anything with you . " " All right , if you feel that way now , I can understand that , but at least we can talk  --  " " And I do n't want to talk to you . I do n't know why I 'm talking to you now , it 's a waste of time talking to someone who does nothing but lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " If you really want to do something , Brian , you might try to find a decent doctor who would be willing to help Wendy . And do n't bother calling Dr. Bunch . I already tried him . "  | " You mean someone in New York . " " New York , or Corinth , or Albany or Boston or Puerto Rico , it does n't matter . " " But there 's no point in that , Erica . Even if I could locate someone , I still ca n't get in touch with Wendy . I do n't have her telephone number in New York , I mean New Jersey . " " I know how to reach her . " " You do ? Good , give me the number . " " I 'm not going to give you anything . Wendy does n't want to speak to you , anyhow . " " But  --  " " If you find a doctor , you can call me . Otherwise , I do n't want to hear from you again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Are you there ? Do n't hang up ... Oh , shit . " 3. " 799-0579 . " " Leonard ? This is Brian Tate . " " Well , good evening , Brian . Are you in the city ? " " No , I 'm in Corinth . " " Ah , Corinth . And how is everything up there ? How is my ex-wife , and my ex-children ? " " They 're well , as far as I know ; I have n't seen them recently  --  " " And how are you , and all your relatives ? " " Fine , thank  --  Well , not so fine , actually . Something 's come up , that I wanted to consult you about . " " Of course . Listen , Brian , can I call you back in about half an hour ? I have a friend here now . " " Yeh , all right  --  No , wait a minute ; I 'm not at home . " " Not at home ? Where are you , then ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A motel , in Corinth ? "  | " Well , just south of Corinth . I believe it 's in Hesiod , actually . It 's called the Twin Birches Motel . " " You 're in a motel , hm . It sounds like you 've got a problem . " " Yeh . " " All right , give me your number . " " It 's  --  No , I 'll call you back . I 'm in a pay phone . " " In that case , maybe you 'd better tell me about it now . Inez , honey , could you excuse me a minute ? This is an old friend calling from Corinth , and he 's got a problem . . . No , you do n't need to leave , just move over to the other side of the bed so I can reach the phone a little better . . . Okay . So what 's up up there ? What are you doing in a motel , did Erica throw you out ? " " Yes , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I would have said it was n't in Erica to do anything so vulgar , so obvious , so lower-middle-class . But we live and learn . And why did she throw you out ? " " Well , it 's complicated . I do n't want to go into the whole thing now , I just . .. " " Was it for the obvious , vulgar reason ? " " What ? I 'm afraid I do n't understand you . I 've had a hell of an exhausting day . " " Let me put it this way . I take it you 're not alone now . " " What ? Oh no , that 's all right , no one can hear us . " " I mean , there 's somebody with you , is n't there ? Not in thephone booth , in the , what was it , Twin Bitches Motel . " " Twin Birches . No , I 'm here alone . " " I see . Excuse me . I mean , I do n't see . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not as far as I know . I wish I was drunk . That 's an idea . Maybe I should get drunk . " " All right , Brian , hold on . I 'm listening to you . . . So what 's your problem ? " " It 's  --  Leonard , can your girl friend hear me ? " " I do n't think so . She 's not listening , anyhow ; she 's readingArt International . "  | " It 's  --  You know I 'm counting on your discretion about this . " " Yeh , all right . Go ahead . " " I mean , if what I 'm going to tell you should get out , if it was known around the university , it would really screw things up for me . " " It wo n't get out . Do n't worry . " " The thing is  --  Could n't you ask her to go into the other room for a few minutes ? " " There is no other room . You 've seen this apartment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what my ex-wife leaves me . Do you want me to ask her to go into the bathroom ? " " No ; never mind . You know , Leonard , I want you to understand that I would n't have called you if I was n't really up against the wall , or if I had any other way of getting the information . You understand that , do n't you ? " " For shit 's sake ! What information ? " " I do n't want to relate the whole history . What I wanted to ask you . What I called about , is . I need to locate an abortionist . " " I see . . . Well , you surprise me more and more . Hold on . Let me think a moment . . . How soon do you need this information ? " " As soon as possible . There 's a chance the , uh , girl might do something rash , she 's in kind of a disturbed state now of course , she 's very young , quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student ? " " No . A graduate student . " " Well , congratulations . . . It 's not going to be all that easy , you know . I 've never had this particular problem myself , touch wood . I 'll have to make inquiries . " " All right . But you can find someone ? " " I do n't know yet . I think I might be able to get you a name . But it 'll cost you . " " I have some money , I already went to the bank this afternoon . " " How much ? " " Six hundred dollars . "  | " Better make it a thousand . " " A thousand ? " " If you do n't want any mess . I can probably lend you the rest , if you need it . " " No . That 's not necessary . I  --  " " Your time is up , please signal when through . " " All right . . . I do n't need any money , thanks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say about ten , at the university ? " " At the university ? " " You have my number , do n't you , it 's  --  " " I have it , I only wondered " " Your time is up , please signal when through . " " All right , goddamn it ! I was saying , I wondered if your switchboard girl might " " Forget about that . This is n't Corinth , nobody here cares how many students you knock up . And try to relax , friend , okay ? It 's not World War III . "  | " How is everything ? " Erica asks in a low anxious voice , coming into Danielle 's house and shutting the door behind her against the morning frost and damp thin mist . " All right . " " Where 's Wendy ? " " Still asleep . " Danielle gestures toward the ceiling , toward her spare room , where Wendy has been staying since yesterday afternoon . Erica had thought first of keeping her at home until she felt better and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erica 's house is not a good place for Wendy . First , because it contains Jeffrey and Matilda . Meeting them would certainly be upsetting to Wendy  --  and still more upsetting for the children if they were to learn who and what Wendy was  --  something she might very easily reveal by mistake in her present state . Even more dangerous was the possible reappearance of Brian . Erica had told him to stay away , but there is no guarantee he will do so . It was very likely that he would suddenly decide to come home to get clean shirts or argue his case . This would be bad enough if Erica were there ; worse if Wendy were alone . Brian has already done her serious emotional damage , and might do more.  |p149But  Erica could not stay home with Wendy night and day ; she had to shop for groceries , buy Matilda a Halloween costume for tonight , deliver two drawings to the Community Art Show and Jeffrey to the dentist . At Danielle 's , however , Wendy would be safe from Brian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was often some old acquaintance or student of their mother 's staying in the spare room . " How is she ? " Erica asks . " Still pretty exhausted . She went to bed early , but I heard her moving around much later . " Danielle , who is dressed to go out , picks up her briefcase from the table , then sets it down . " Listen , I spoke to Bernie last night , after you called . " " Oh , good . What did he say ? " Danielle shakes her head . " Not much . He does n't know of anybody he could recommend . He does n't like the whole idea , anyhow : he thinks Wendy ought to go into a home he knows of and have the baby , give it up for adoption . He gave me the address . " Danielle shrugs . " Anyhow he wo n't do it himself . When I asked about that he got quite angry , angrier than I 've ever seen him . He said , I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a woman , not a pet chow . ' " " He could do it , if he wanted to . " " I guess so . But he wo n't . I do n't think he 'd ever break the law ; one of his brothers is a cop , you know . " Danielle makes a face . " Maybe he 's right about the home . It 'd be safe at least . " " But Wendy would n't want to leave school , not for such a long time . " " I do n't know . I think probably she 'll do anything you tell her . Especially if she thought it was good for Brian and his Great Book . " Danielle grins shortly . She pulls a red flowered scarf from the pocket of her raincoat , shakes it out , and ties it over her hair . " I have to get up to school I should 've been there an hour ago . But listen , if you still think Wendy ought to have the operation , I couldask my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't do that yet , " Erica says . " I heard from Brian this morning ; he gave me the name of a doctor in New York he says is supposed to be reliable . " " Oh yeh ? Well , okay . I 'll be back in my office after twelve if you need me for anything . Tell Wendy to help herself to whatever she wants to eat . Roo fed the bacon I was saving for her to Pogo ; typical , huh ? But there 's plenty of eggs , and some coffee on the stove . " Alone , Erica takes off her raincoat , thinking hard thoughts about children : their ingratitude , their greed . This morning there had been another hateful scene about steak sandwiches , the third in a series of such scenes . Matilda had become shrill ; Jeffrey loud and coarse : " Can we go out tonight for dinner , at least ? " " Aw shit , why not ? " " That 's no reason . You said you were too tired yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away you would take us to the Faculty Club and we could have a Supersteak Sandwich , did n't she ? " " I do n't want you to make me one at home . The kind you make are always foul . " " You always promise you 'll do things for us but you never do , you 're just lying . " " I wo n't be quiet . Liar , liar , liar . " What is so deeply unfair is that this scene , and the others  --  her anger and guilt , the children 's anger and disappointment  --  are all Brian 's fault . She would be perfectly willing to take Jeffrey and Matilda to the Faculty Club , were it not for the possibility , indeed the probability , that Brian will also be there and not , as she had told them , in Detroit , Michigan . Liar , liar , liar . Erica hangs up her coat and goes into Danielle 's kitchen , where she switches on the light and begins to make breakfast for Wendy . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is built close against a steep wooded hill . The front rooms are large and sunny , with a winter view across the valley and the lake . But the kitchen at the rear is dark , cramped , overhung almost a basement . It is impossible to work there without artificial light ; but as Danielle often points out , this house like most houses was designed and built by men . It is true , Erica thinks : men run the world , and they run it for their own convenience . It is a man who is responsible for Wendy 's present condition  --  for her exhaustion , her desperation , her danger . And the two women who are trying to rescue her from this condition can not do it on their own ; they must beg and plead for help from other men . Erica turns Danielle 's stove to medium high . The iron snail of the electric coil slowly flushes a sullen red-black . Hateful , she thinks , hateful that women should have to appeal to their natural enemy in such a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expose themselves to the pompous assumptions and disapproval of a country doctor like Bunch ; to the self-righteous anger of such a person as Bernie Kotelchuk . It is Danielle who has had to bear Dr. Kotelchuk 's anger , since he is not aware of the connection between Erica and Wendy , whom he believes to be one of Danielle 's students . But Erica feels his words striking at her through Danielle , like invisible machine-gun bullets , wounding them both , weakening their resolve . Women are emotionally soft still ; so long dependent on male approval that they are influenced even by the opinions of men they despise . The stove brightens to a grainy vermilion . Erica melts butter in a frying pan and breaks two eggs into it . The golden , nourishing , domed yolks quiver against each other and come to rest , surrounded by the thin , gluey viscous whites ; like semen . Meanwhile upstairs at the top of the house in the spare room , floating in a bowl inside Wendy , there is something similar . It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find someone to help Wendy ; if it were possible to refuse to tell Brian where she is or what she is going to do ; to renounce his assistancep152entirely , to break off all connection with him , to hang up when his voice sounds inside the black plastic cannon-mouth of the telephone and leave him altogether alone and in the wrong , where he belongs . But time is passing . The eggs are swelling and congealing in the frying pan ; Wendy is pregnant , and every moment , even now while she lies unconscious overhead , she is becoming more pregnant . And the more pregnant she becomes , the more dangerousan operation will be . The truth is , even the best possible operation is dangerous , Erica thinks , lowering two slices of raisin bread into Danielle 's toaster . The most skillful , legal , routine operation , for example an appendectomy , in the most modern hospital , can go wrong . Too much anesthetic may be given , or too little ; there may be shock , infection , complications . And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where there is no greed or fear of the law , no need for haste and secrecy . . . Perhaps after all it is better that the responsibility of finding an abortionist , and the blame afterward if anything does go wrong , should rest upon Brian . Erica sets a tin tray on the counter and lays on it a plate , a white paper napkin and three sharp metal implements : a knife , a fork , a spoon . The result is unpleasant . It is not improved when she slides Wendy 's two fried eggs onto the plate , and one breaks in the process , bleeding gluey yellow . The raisins in the toast look like black scabs , and the coffee , smoking darkly , isBut she must not give way to morbid imagination ; she must be calm , cheerful , rational when she goes upstairs . Erica adds sugar and milk liberally to the bloody coffee , takes two deep deliberate breaths , and picks up the tray . " Wendy ? " There is no answer to her knock ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather cold . She sets the tray down and raises the blind , which has been lowered so far that its end lies limp on the radiator . Even then the room is grayed , obscure ; white mist presses up against the glass . " Wendy ? " No response . In a cage by the window somep153shredded newspapers and shavings begin to squeak and rustle about ; one of Roo 's gerbils raises its muzzle and front paws . " Would you like some breakfast ? " " Wha ? " The voice comes not from the pillow , which has been abandoned at the bed head , but out of a snarl of sheets and blankets halfway to the foot . " It 's quite late , you know . " The mound of bedclothes moves , and Wendy puts her head out from it . " Erica ? Wha time is it ? " " About eleven . " " Oh , wow . " Wendy squints , rubs her eyes , and sits up on her haunches , in a short crumpled cotton nightgown . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unshaven prickly legs and stained feet . Her hair , snarled with sleep , hangs like limp shredded wheat . " How do you feel ? " Erica asks . " All right , I guess . " Wendy grins feebly . " Hungry . " " I brought you some breakfast . " " Breakfast ? Great . " She smiles as the tray is lowered onto a chair by the bed , not seeing there what Erica sees . " Hey , raisin toast , fantastic . " Squatting on the rim of the bed , she pushes her hair out of the way and begins to eat , while Erica stands watching , planning what she is about to say . Wendy or no , better she herself  --  must call the number Brian gave her and make an appointment for as soon as possible . Brian will provide the necessary cash from his famous separate account , but will not be told where or when the operation is taking place . Someone will have to go to New York with Wendy ; her roommate , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to accompany Wendy on the long bus ride to the city , to walk the Manhattan streets looking for the address , to sit in the waiting room while behind a closed door the bleeding fried eggs No , she ca n't do that , that would be going too far , in every sense . And besides , she has to stay with The Children . But if she is afraid just to go to New York , to wait in the nextp154room , what must Wendy feel ? At the moment , apparently nothing . She is eating with small eager bites , shoving egg onto her fork with a piece of toast , lifting it , chewing . Erica opens her mouth , but something keeps her from speaking : reluctance to interrupt Wendy 's innocent enjoyment , or perhaps the social rule learned so early it is almost instinctive that nice people do n't discuss medical problems during meals . Wendy drinks from the mug , sets it down , and wipes her mouth with the back of her paw . " How come you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , " she adds , since Erica does not at once reply , " considering what I did to you , it really kind of zaps me out , all this . " " But you did n't do anything to me , " explains Erica , sitting down across the room in Leonard 's former desk chair and rotating it toward the bed . " Sure I did . " " Not to me personally . You did n't owe me anything youdid n't even know me then . " " You think that matters ? " " Of course . " Erica does not add the moral that now Wendyknows her and thus owes her she barely even thinks it . " But still . " Wendy grins uneasily . " Why should you want to help me ? " " Well . Partly because I think women have to stick together . Like Danielle said yesterday : we 're all members of an underprivilegedmajority , and if we can help each other we ought to . " Wendy 's plate appears to be empty . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anything ? " " No thanks . That was great . " Wendy sags back against the wallpaper , hitching up one shoulder of her nightgown . " You 're welcome . " Erica transfers the breakfast tray to the desk and sits down in the bedside chair . " I 've been doing some research , " she begins in a reassuring voice , " and I think I 've finally got some results . " " Results ? " Wendy looks perplexed , not reassured.  | " Yes , I 've heard of a doctor now , in New York , and I thought I might call him " " You do n't have to do that , I  --  " Wendy interrupts . " I know I do n't have to do it , " Erica interrupts back . " But I want to do it . " She smiles kindly . " And I think I should call now , this morning , because it 's really better not to lose any more time , and make an appointment for you . " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wendy huddles her knees up to her chest and pulls the nightgown down over them to her feet , so that her body is enclosed in crumpled cotton like a small bundle of unhappy washing . " But this is a very good man ; he 's supposed to be extremely careful , reliable  --  " She speaks gently , not allowing any vexation to show . " I do n't mean that . What I mean is , I 'm not sure I wan na see any doctor now . I think maybe I hafta , like , go through with it . " " Go through with it ? But what on earth for ? " Erica forgets to modulate her voice . " Because maybe I should . See , the thing is . " Wendy fixes her eyes on Erica . " Last night , well I guess early this morning really , about five , I woke up . And I could n't get back to sleep again , I was so psyched up about everything . I thought how I was making all this grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is just go down to the Greyhound station and take the next bus to New York whenever it was . So I got up and dressed and went out . It was pretty freaky really , because it was still completely dark , and more or less raining . I was walking along not paying much attention where , and then the street stopped and there I was right by the edge of the gorge . " And I thought , Why not ? I thought how I wanted to make Brian so happy and give him everything , but all he 'd got from me actually was a lot of heavy trouble so that he like never wants to see me again . And if I went and had the abortion , I would be like ripping off all this bread from him , hundreds of dollars . " Wendy 's voice weakens ; she lowers her face to her knees . " Well , anyhow , itp156seemed like the fastest way to solve everybody 's problem , " she says hoarsely . " And I thought , God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he exists . " So I sorta got up on the wall , " she continues from behind her knees , in the thin confiding voice of a schoolchild describing her trip to the park . " I ca n't stand heights usually , you know . I do n't even like crossing the bridge to campus . That open grid really freaks me out , and if I look down , everything starts to spin . But it was so dark last night I could n't see anything ; I could hear the water running , but I liked that . I mean it seemed right , you know ? The end of the year , rain falling , leaves falling , water falling . I thought how I 'd kind of loused up in this incarnation , and maybe next time I 'd be reborn as something easier like a cow or a tomato plant . " Wendy grins . " Well , so I was sitting there on the stone wall , getting really soaked , shivering . But I thought how it did n't matter because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anything . I hung my legs over and squinted down between them into the gorge , to make sure there was n't anything in the way like a tree or a rock , because I did n't want to miss and just get smashed up . And then I happened to look across to the other side and there was a light on in one of the dorms . Somebody was still awake studying ; or maybe they had got up real early . I remembered reading how John Stuart Mill used to rise before dawn to work on his philosophy by lamplight . And Brian  --  at Harvard he used to stay up studying almost all night sometimes , you know ? And then it hit me that maybe I was n't important , but here , inside me "  --  Wendy lowers her knees and lays one fist on her nightgown  --  " there was somebody that had half Brian 's genes , and maybe it was destined to be as brilliant as him ; maybe a great genius . And years from now some night when everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university working and studying . Only if I got off that wall on the wrong side , they would never get the chance . " Wendy 's last words catch in her throat and come out damp ; she begins crying.  | " I 'm sorry I had no idea , " Erica says , moving from her chair to the bed . She reaches across it and touches Wendy 's shoulder , smoothing it lightly but firmly as if she were making pie crust . " Danielle said you were restless , moving around last night , but I did n't know  --  " " It 's okay , " Wendy gasps . " It 's just that . Brian . I remembered when . He was telling me that . " She swallows with apparent difficulty . " I mean , like I knew all along he did n't love me the way I love him , I could accept that , but I never thought he 'd Hey , this is sort of freaky , " she says in a different tone , looking up and focusing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . " " That 's all right . " Erica is still sitting on the edge of the bed , but she has stopped patting Wendy 's shoulder since it occurred to her that Brian also had patted this shoulder at one time ; or rather many times . " But listen . " Wendy makes an effort to steady her voice ; she swallows hard . " What I hafta ask you is , do you think I could be right ? About the baby . I mean , did you ever feel the same about your kids , that their lives are very valuable , more than most , because of their heredity ? Not only Brian , you know , but all those judges and people in New England history that he 's descended from . I mean , his kids might grow up to be important people , maybe very brilliant , great human beings . " " Yes , " Erica admits . " I thought something like that once , when Jeffrey and Matilda were babies . " She does not add that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be great human beings , or possibly even human beings . It would probably seem only one more reason why someone else ( Wendy , for instance ) should try to reproduce Brian 's valuable genes . " So you think I should go through with it ? " " I 'm not sure , " replies Erica , who is sure but wants to give the impression of reflection , and to marshal her arguments . " It 's a very serious responsibility , " she says . " I mean , you ca n't just have a baby . That 's only the beginning ; it 's a lifetime job . A child needs more than good heredity , it needs a stable family , parents who "  | " But I do n't want to raise it myself , " Wendy interrupts . " I just think maybe I ought to have it , you know ? " She sits forward . " There are homes you can go away to ; Danielle said last night she might know of one . There was this place out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to . They took care of everything and found people to adopt the kid . Do you think it could still be running ? " " I suppose it might be , " Erica admits . " It would be sort of a drag , because I 'd have to stay there for like four or five months . My girl friend said they were always lecturing them and showing them these gross-out films on drugs and VD , and they made her go to church every day and take sewing lessons . But maybe I could work on my thesis some , at least do the reading . The place Sharon went was free , too . That 'd be cool , if I could find a place like that , so I would n't be ripping off Ma or Brian . " " You must n't worry about that , " Erica says firmly , standing up . " You must n't even consider it . Brian can certainly afford to pay for the operation . " " But that 's not fair . " " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fault ; it 's my own stupid fault . There was this all-night party and I missed a day and a half and then I thought I could make up for it by taking two pills at once , because I 'm so stupid . " Wendy shows signs of beginning to cry again seriously . " Please , Wendy . Do n't upset yourself , " Erica begs her . " There 's no use thinking about that now . " These remarks are not effective . " I 'm sure it ca n't be good for the baby , " she tries . " No . " Wendy attempts to control her gulping sobs . " Yeh . " " You 're overtired , that 's what it is . Why do n't you go back to sleep for a while ? Danielle 's children do n't come home for lunch , so you can get a good rest . Come on now . Lie down . " " Okay . " Wendy uncurls and subsides onto the bed , then half rises again . " You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the bookshop , " she announces.  | " Bookshop ? " " The Krishna Bookshop . Do you know it ? " " I 've heard of it . " " I want to talk to Zed . Do you know Zed ? " " No , " says Erica , who has not thought of Sandy Finkelstein once since she found Wendy on her porch . " You ought a meet him , he 's out of this world . I mean like literally . He 's a renunciate ; he 's renounced all material goods and possessive relationships . He does n't even drink coffee . He 's been on the Path for years . You know , the spiritual Path . " " I see . " Erica has a vision of Sandy on the Path : it appears to her as a narrow dirt track , overhung with brambles , winding up haphazardly through a steep dark wood . " He 's helped me a lot , you know . He 's very wise . " A new and disagreeable possibility occurs to Erica . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Uh uh . I have n't seen him since I found out for sure . Well , he sort of knows I 'm in love with somebody , but he does n't know who it is . He 's not interested in details like that , only in your spiritual development . . . I think maybe I 'll go down there this afternoon and get him to look at my chart . " " Chart ? " " My horoscope . Zed 's a really heavy astrologer . " " Please , Wendy , do n't do that , " Erica asks . " I mean , too many people know about this already . " " But Zed would n't tell anyone . He 's a fanatic about keeping secrets ; he 's a double Pisces , with practically all his planets in the twelfth house . " " All the same , I 'd rather he did n't know . Not yet , anyhow . Please . " " Well . Okay . " Wendy lies down again with a small sigh . " Here 's your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade and carries the tray downstairs . The plate is empty now except for a sticky yellowp160smear and some dark broken crumbs , and there is only a dirty sludge in the mug ; but she does not like it any better . She sets the tray on the kitchen counter and looks at the telephone beside it . Should she call that doctor now and make the appointment ? Danielle is probably right : Wendy will go to New York if Erica tells her to . But if she goes only because Erica tells her to , whatever happens there will be Erica 's fault . It is all so difficult , so complicated . If she had refused to speak to Wendy yesterday , as some  --  perhaps most wives would have , Wendywould be in Jersey City , and everything would have been over soon one way or another . But it is too late for that now . Sometimes a miserable refugee cat or dog , abandoned by its owners , appears in your yard . If you keep your door shut until it goes away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into the house , feed it , find it a place to stay . From then on you are responsible . Of course sometimes the stray cat runs away again , as had almost happened last night . If Wendy had gone then , taken the bus to New York before anything more could be done for her , it would have been distressing ; but also a kind of relief . There would have been no more responsibility and blame then for Erica and Danielle only for Brian . If Wendy had done something awful andstupid ( Erica does not think " killed herself " ) there would have been unending guilt for him . All the rest of his life Brian would have carried this guilt on his back , like a phantom knapsack full of wet broken bloody rocks . No , no . Even now , she can not wish him that . But whatever happens in New York , there will be something in the knapsack . At the best , something halfway between a dead fish and a dead baby . Brian will haul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; at night he will drag it home again . The ghostly knapsack will be propped against the wall of her sitting room , a dim , uneven canvas shape ; later it will lie collapsed , almost but never quite empty , in a dark corner of their bedroom ; all night , night after night , year after year.  |p161No  , Erica resolves , settling the perforated chrome basket into Danielle 's sink to block the drainpipe , she can not do that to Brian or to herself . She can not call that doctor  --  some othersolution must be found . She turns on the water and squeezes out detergent , slides the frying pan into the hot suds , and begins to clear off Wendy 's tray , on which the surgical implements are beginning to turn back into ordinary tableware . Suppose Wendy goes into a home . That means that for months she will be in some ugly institutional building somewhere in the state , forced to sew and sing hymns with a lot of other stupid , unhappy girls , all of them swelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balloon will pop , and a child , Brian 's child , will be released into the world . Official persons will take it away and give it to strangers , among whom it will continue to exist , imagined but always unseen , for the rest of Erica 's and Brian 's and Wendy 's life . All of them will have many years to think of this lost , unknown baby  --  child boy or girl man or woman . Is that anybetter ? No , it is almost worse . There must be some other way , Erica thinks , frowning and chewing the inside of her cheek as she rinses the dishes under the tap and sets them to drain . Suppose someone they knew were to adopt Wendy 's baby ; someone really intelligent , kind , responsible  --  She tries to think of such persons , but no name comes to mind . What if she , Erica , were to take the baby , to adopt it herself and bring it up , as E. Nesbit did with her husband 's illegitimate children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , generous , romantic , Erica had thought when she read of this . To have a baby again its plump face , its solid small weight against her leftshoulder , its small fat hands catching at her hair  --  " Is that the right thing ? " she asks , whispering the words aloud over the sink , above the white sudsy water . There is no reply ; instead , as if she had opened a box of insects , a cloud of buzzing , biting problems and complications rises up , filling the kitchen with the whirr of wings . First , could she get away with it ? E. Nesbit and her husband were radical bohemians living in a big isolated country house ; thep162Tates are part of a small-town academic community . Is she going to pretend to be pregnant , buying phony maternity clothes , wearing an ever-larger pillow under her skirt for the next six months ? Could she successfully fake a confinement and appear to go into the hospital , so that none of her friends suspect how admirable , noble , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , they will probably pity her for having been careless enough to become pregnant again at forty , and/or condemn her for deliberatelyadding to the population problem . Those who know the family best may be surprised that the Tates want another child , after two such evident failures . Perhaps it would be better to say that they were adopting a baby , though this too will require justification indeed an elaboraterationale ; and even then some people may wonder whose child it really is . Either way it means months , years , a lifetime of lying . And what will Jeffrey and Matilda think when the baby appears ? What is she going to tell them ; or how is she going to deceive them ? And it is not only the deception , but the possibility of being found out in it . Too many people already know about Wendy , and it would be foolish to expect that none of them will pass it on , or will add 1 + 1 = 1 if a baby disappears from Wendy 's stomach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that Wendy will disclose the truth herself . She may think she feels nothing now , but maternal instinct may catch up with her . Then she will want to see her child , to visit it ; perhaps she will desperately want it back . Even if Wendy were to forget the whole thing and move to Alaska or Hawaii , there would always be the apprehension that she might return , the knowledge that the child is really hers . And is Erica sure she can love Wendy 's child through years of Infant and Child Care : years of damp diapers , jars of strained apricots , broken push toys and bedtime tears ? Can she swear that she will never blame its childish misbehavior on heredity ? Yes . She can swear this . But what about Brian ? Even if hep163agrees to let her adopt Wendy 's child , how will he act toward it ? Bad enough if he were to favor it over the others ; still worse if he should particularly dislike it . The crowd of buzzing complications are beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tiny pink winged vision of a baby . Erica realizes that with the slightest encouragementshe too could start to cry right here ; to sob and shake . But she can not allow herself that . She must remain calm and think clearly , because , at last , she has an important decision to make . First , she must give up the idea of taking Wendy 's child . Considering everything , especially considering Brian , there are too many problems . She would prefer not to consider Brian ; she would rather not think of him at all , but that is impossible . He can not stay in " Detroit " forever ; he will have to come home , and she will have to see him . At first , just as before , he will be solemn and contrite . He will accuse himself , and figuratively pour ashes upon his head , but in reality his hair will remain quite shiny and smooth , sideburns and all . Then he will begin to explain how the affair with Wendy meant nothing to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is not important . Gradually his smooth , shiny air of self-esteem will reappear . He will begin to think that it is time for Erica to swallow his version of events , and to forgive and forget again . Presently , if she does not do so , he will begin to feel righteously aggrieved . Erica rinses Danielle 's frying pan under hot water and sets it upside down on the drainboard . She turns off the tap and lifts the metal basket from the sink . There is a sound of choking from below ; the dirty water , floating gray curds of detergent , quivers as it is sucked down into the drain , which swallows it finally to the dregs with a nauseous gulp . Looking ahead , down into the long dirty dark drainpipe of the coming winter , Erica can imagine that she might one day be able to accept what has happened ; that she might be able to forgive . But the person she will forgive is not her husband Brian Tate , but a weak , shallow-minded , self-justifying middle-aged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in messy , loveless adulteries ; and they are forgiven , because nothing better can be hoped from them . But Brian will not only expect to be forgiven , and to have his version of events listened to and believed . At some time during this process he will want to move back into the house on Jones Creek Road , and presently he will want to move back into the bedroom . He will expect Erica to make love to him ; to love him , although it has been proved he does not love her , or anyone . And this is impossible . Erica can never like , much less love the person her husband has turned into . The very most she will ever be able to do is to pretend to tolerate him , to remain silent as he rehearses his excuses and false protestations of love , to wait and watch for the next sign of deception , to lie still under him at night with her teeth together . Lies , more lies , years of lies . It is so much easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the house ; she need only see him a few times a year . She can say what she thinks of him without risking criticism , because everyone knows now what he is really like . And it is easier for Leonard too : he need not be reminded every day of how shabbily he has behaved . Really it is more charitable to let a man like that live where his faults will not be so glaringly obvious : among other shallow , undependable people who will forgive him because they are no better themselves . Or perhaps among naive people who still believe in him , who accept his pretensions , as Wendy does Brian 's and thus possibly motivate him to live up tothese pretensions . Wendy still thinks Brian a great man , a hero ; she thinks that the book he is writing will be a great book . This need not be wholly naivete : very likely , when Brian is with her he plays that part , or more than plays it  --  he really is serious , dignified , affectionate , etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especiallypeople he does not know too well ; and after all , it has taken Erica herself nearly twenty years to find him out . If Wendy were to know him as well A faint idea , like the shadow of a small fastp165plane or a large bird flickering in weak sunlight high over a field , crosses Erica 's mind at this moment , and is gone . But Wendy will never see Brian as he really is now ; she will go through life mourning him as a lost hero . Whereas Erica , very soon , will have to see Brian again . If she puts it off much longer she will seem hysterical , unforgiving ; everyone will blame her . Then she will have to let him move back into the house . And when she does so , it will become a sort of prison . She remembers a conversation she had once with Sandy Finkelstein , coming home from The Magic Flute on the streetcar along Mass . Avenue . He had been reading Dante 's Inferno , and was saying how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the whirlwind , had it so bad , because they were with someone they loved passionately . The real hell , he said , would be to be with someone you could n't stand . " Or someone you once loved , but now you hate them , " Erica suggested . " Like my mother . That would be the worst . " In that same conversation Sandy had said what really gave him the horrors was all those people drifting outside hell in that sort of dirty fog , the ones who did neither good nor evil , but were for themselves . There must be some other solution for all of them , Erica thinks ; some way out of that fog . A moment ago there was a sort of idea in her mind . . . She looks out the kitchen window into the misty narrow backyard . The shadow of the idea is returning ; nearer this time , darker , more distinct Yes . Now she recognizes it.  |p166Teachers  , especially university professors , often have an elective affinity with their subjects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association , language instructors born in Missouri and Brooklyn look and act remarkably like Frenchmen and Italians , professors of economics resemble bankers , and musicologists are indistinguishable from musicians . The similarity is usually only one of style ; indeed most professors , at least at Corinth , tend to regard with suspicion and hostility any colleague who leaves the academy to practice what they preach . These affinities also profoundly influence the functioning of the various Corinth University departments . They determine , for instance , which academic issues will take the longest to resolve and arouse the strongest feelings . Members of the math department tend to quarrel over the figures in their annual report , and members of the English department over its wording . In Psychology , analysis of the personality traits of candidates for promotion sometimes ends in ego-dystonic shouting ; and the controversy over the new men 's washroom in the Architecture Building ( during which two professors who had not designed an actual building in twenty years came to blows ) has already passed into university annals . But it is among Brian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is most strongly felt . Since every member of the political science department is in outward manner and inner fantasy an expert political strategist , every issue provokes public debate and private lobbying . Even when there is little at stake , eloquent speeches are made ; wires are skillfully pulled and logs rolled out of simple enjoyment of the sport . In the past Brian has played the game with as much zest as any of his colleagues . Today it seems petty and tiresome . The transactions of the Curriculum Committee , of which he is chairman , appear vain playacting , and the question it is discussing very trivial compared to that on his own agenda , viz. : How is he going to cope with his wife 's crazy demand that he divorce her and marry Wendy Gahaghan ? The issue which is now before the committee , and which has been before it for an hour already , plus nearly as long on Tuesday before the whole department , is known as the Pass-Fail Option . It first appeared last week in the shape of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteen in other departments , four teaching fellows , and three persons giving the names of " Thomas Paine , " " F. Kafka " and " Janis Joplin . " These fifty-eight real and imaginary persons demand that students in political science courses be allowed to choose whether they shall receive a letter grade or merely an indication that they have or have not passed a course . In practice it is likely that the Pass-Fail Option would havelittle effect . The experience of the history department last springsuggests that the only students who will opt for it are those whowould prefer the euphemism Pass to the letter C. Nevertheless , the matter has provoked great controversy : Brian 's colleagues have made long and sometimes emotional speeches containing phraseslike " freedom of conscience , " " academic integrity , " " evasion ofresponsibility " and " moral cowardice "  --  the last two of which he has heard in another context recently , in fact only a few hours ago , when they were used by his wife to describe his conduct to Wendy . Brian 's committee , which is supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is divided on the issue . Each of the four other members has , as usual , taken up a philosophical position which he is arguing in his characteristic style . For not only do professors resemble their subjects ; these resemblances are subdivided within each department . Just as some instructors in art history take on what they imagine to be the appearance , manner and opinions of Renoir , and others what they imagine to be those of Jim Dine , so each of Brian 's colleagues imitates a school of political thought , if not a specific politician . John Randall , the grand old man of the department , last survivor from the days when it was known as the Department of Government , appears to Brian in the role of Cordell Hull . He is a large stiff elderly man , somewhat pompous and slow on the uptake , but with remarkable staying power ; a Hegelian who lectures on political philosophy , often quoting by memory from Plato . It is John Randall 's view that if they admit the Pass-Fail Option , they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recognize true excellence . Students at Corinth are created equal in opportunity to attend lectures in Government ( as he still calls it ) , but not equal in ability to comprehend these lectures . The petition should therefore be rejected , politely but in a firm and dignified manner . Brian 's principal enemy in the department , C. Donald Dibble , also opposes the petition , but more violently ; just as he has for years opposed every proposal and blocked every suggestion for curriculum change made by Brian . It is largely due to him that the committee has accomplished almost nothing since September . A tense , talkative , rather paranoid bachelor , Don Dibble designates himself in interviews , of which he gives many on varied topics , as a " radical conservative . " Brian has privately designated him as Metternich . Dibble is a political philosopher of a more recent school that Randall 's , but he also quotes Plato frequently  --  and in Brian 's view deceptively . He has been trained at the University of Chicago to hunt out the basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently obscure events . Occasion/ally he fails to flush any significant issues from the shrubbery , and refrains from involvement in the ensuing discussion ; but not today . Hidden in the Pass-Fail Option , Dibble has discovered a wedgeshapedanimal something like an elephant . If his colleagues let it into the department , he insists , they will be abdicating the responsibilities of power and yielding to mob pressure . Presently larger and larger elephants will enter behind it , and trample them all to death , which will be no more than they deserve . Chuck Markowitz , the youngest member of the committee , appears in the role of Castro . He is an awkward , engaging young radical who is also extremely well read . Normally Brian feels rather fond of Chuck , but today he is impatient with him . For one thing , Chuck is not only in favor of granting the demands of the petition ; he is probably responsible , at least in part , for its having been written in the first place , and thus for the special departmental meeting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the trouble which has followed from that . It is his fault that the five of them are sitting in this room now instead of attending to their personal or academic business . More generally , Brian holds it against Chuck that though over thirty he affects the costume of a radical undergraduate , and has allowed his hair to grow out until it resembles a small dirty black poodle dog sitting on top of his head . Chuck 's remarks in favor of the Pass-Fail Option are extensive and predictable . He dwells upon the stupidities and inequalities of the present grading system , with illustrative anecdotes ; he extolls the superiority of independent study , and the success of free universities . " After all , " he concludes , grinning engagingly , " how can we really know what some kid has learned in our course ? How do we have any right to grade him ? " The faces of the other committee members harden at these words , and they silently give Chuck 's speech the grade of B-minus . Last to speak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever man who is Brian 's best friend in the department . Andrews has long ago adopted for himself the role of Machiavelli . In meetingsp170he plays the part of the detached scientist , observing and occasionallymanipulating political forces out of pure intellectual curiosity . It is impossible to guess what side Andrews will take on any question , since he is as likely to be motivated by cynical amusementas by either interest or principle . Today , after appearing to hesitate for some time , he has finally come out in favor of the Pass-Fail Option  --  largely , Brian suspects , in order to cause trouble . Andrews declines to consider any of the larger issues involved . He merely points out in his dry way that the Option has been allowed by several other departments with apparently little effect , and that the petition has been signed by over half their own majors . If its demands are not met , considerable ill feeling will be felt . There will be mutterings about monolithic bureaucracy ; snide or angry letters and editorials will appear in the student newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclamation , among which the words " truckling " and " expediency " can be heard . The other three professors begin to repeat the arguments they have already put forth , and to make the points they have made half an hour ago or on Tuesday . Brian does not listen to them ; he hears other voices arguing , demanding . He should have suspected trouble from the way his wife sounded on the phone this morning from the tension in her voice , the unnatural pauses . But he was unprepared for the assault which began when he opened the front door of his house an hour laterand they met face to face Erica 's white as if lit from within byfever , with wide ignited eyes . Her Jeanne d'Arc face , he had called it once : the face of a woman fighting , as she believes , for unselfish ends , fanatically certain she is in the right . When Erica herself is injured she merely becomes cross and depressed ; but she can rise to flaming indignation over any injury , or possible injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotter the flames . He has not seen them blaze this high since just before Matilda was born , when she battled two doctors and the management of a large hospital for the right to have the baby stay with her after birth instead of in the hospital nursery . " Do you know what the babies do up there in thatp171place ? " he remembers her demanding in a raised voice as they stood in the admitting office with her pains coming every eight minutes . " Each one is isolated from all human contact in a kind of horrible plastic cage . The lights are always on , glaring down into their eyes twenty-four hours a day , like some North Korean military interrogation , and they cry , that 's what they do , twentyfourhours a day , except when they 're too exhausted even to cry , for five days and nights . That 's their introduction to this world . " Today there was the same high fervor in her voice as she told him he had to marry Wendy  --  not so much for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonexistent infant . And also , according to her , for his own . " You see , Wendy believes in you , " Erica explained , walking rapidly up and down the sitting-room carpet . " She thinks  --  no , it 's more than that , she knows you are a great man and that you are writing a great book . And I do n't know that , not any more . But I do know it 's wrong to hold on to a man you do n't believe in , when there is someone else who does . " Brian had tried to argue calmly with her , to explain that she must n't involve herself in his mistakes ; but he could n't get her to listen , or even stand still . " I do n't agree that it 's not my concern , " she insisted passionately while he followed her up and down the long room . " That 's what the Good Germans ' said . After all , Wendy came to me ; I have to help her . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did neither good nor evil , but were always just for themselves . " After this interview there followed another just as bad , or worse , with Wendy at the Zimmerns '  --  where it turns out she has been staying ever since she disappeared and in the oppressive presence of Danielle Zimmern . Danielle as well as Erica has known all along that Wendy never left Corinth , but she has concealed this from him . In the same way , she and Erica have concealed from Wendy that he has been anxiously and continually seeking her . For Erica , in her present emotional state , there is perhaps some excuse . For Danielle , none . Considering Danielle , Brian grimaces so that Chuck Marko/witz , at whom he happens to be gazing , stumbles over a sentence . He thinks that he has never really liked Danielle ; he has suspected that she does not like him , and now he is sure of it . Very likely she is behind the whole thing . She has somehow convinced Erica that the Jeanne d'Arc thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble language throw him out . She wants him out of the way so that she , Danielle , need not see him any more , and so that Erica also will be a divorced woman . Misery loves company , especially ideological misery  --  and for some time Danielle has sounded more and more like an ideologue . Since Leonard left she has nursed a grudge against men , which she has recently attempted to generalize and dignify as radical feminism . If he did n't know what he knows about her promiscuity at the time of the separation , he might wonder if she were a lesbian . And after all , promiscuity proves nothing ; it might even suggest that Danielle can not really love any man . No doubt she is attractive in a way but is n't there something heavy , something bovine ( or " oxlike " might be a better word ) about her good looks ? He remembers that when he danced with her at parties it sometimes seemed as if she were trying to lead , and he was always uncomfortably aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For months Brian has hardly spoken to Danielle ; but now she has somehow forced herself into his private affairs and is standing over them like a policewoman , so that he hardly dared touch Wendy when they met today , and did not dare kiss her . Yes , a policewoman ; or an MP guarding prisoners of war for , seentogether , she and Wendy might have come from different countries , even different races . He recalls with a pang how small , soft and young Wendy looked , hunched on the Zimmerns ' grotesque Victorian sofa with her bare feet up and her pink freckled arms wrapped protectively around her knees . She seemed reduced in size  --  not only in relation to the oxlike Danielle , but in contrast to Erica , whom he had just left . On one of her plump feet there was the angry , scraped mark of some recent injury . Her eyelidsp173drooped , and her face was the weary , flattened face of child refugees in news photographs . Danielle did most of the talking during this scene , telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly spoke , except to say how grateful she was to Danielle , and even more to Erica how fantastic Erica had been , what a really cool person she was . And then , even less confidently , almost whispering : " I was thinking , what Erica says about kids needing more than just good heredity . I mean that 's straight , you know ? I would n't want just anyone to have this baby . It 'd have to be somebody that could understand it and educate it right . Kids are so impressionable , even bright kids . I mean , suppose they gave it to Republicans or something : its mind could get all warped like . That 's why I got ta do it myself . " Still , subdued though she was , there is no doubt that Wendy was pleased , even overjoyed by the idea that he might marry her . Like a refugee in a first-aid station , afraid to test her sudden luck , she did not ask if he really would do it ; she only looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee are subsiding . Hank Andrews turns toward Brian , who has said nothing for the last half-hour , and asks his opinion . There is a pause while everyone waits for him to step forward in his usual role of George Kennan to make a structural analysis of the conflict and propose a compromise which all of them can , though grudgingly , accept ; that is why he is chairman . But today Brian has difficulty remembering his lines . To gaintime he asks that Chuck read the petition again . He rests hisforehead on his fist and gives the impression of a person listening , while he looks around the table at his colleagues , imagining whatpolitical advice they would give if they knew of his own dilemma . Chuck-Castro might advise him to leave Erica because sherepresents middle age and the past as against youth and the future . On the other hand , with his belief in freedom of choice andp174suspicion of all institutional structures , he is hardly likely to recommend a forced marriage to Wendy . He will probably encourage Brian to assert his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons to lay their trip upon him , or force him into their bag . Randall-Hull will also stress individual freedom , along with individual responsibility . He will enjoin Brian to stand on principle : to uphold his public reputation as a man of moderation and integrity , and to honor his past commitments  --  with specific reference to those made in 1950 in Cambridge , Massachusetts . As for Dibble-Metternich , he will see in Erica and Danielle 's plan what he has detected in other instances : a monstrous conspiracy of women . Or if not a conspiracy , a hysterical revolt against male authority and ( on Erica 's part at least ) against their own best interests . He will demand that Brian suppress this revolt by any means possible , not excluding physical force . Brian can not guess what advice Andrews-Machiavelli would give him , though he is sure to recommend guile rather than oratory or violence . Very possibly he would suggest that Brian attempt to divide and conquer the three adversaries who are now joined against him . The reading of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak . Luckily , the issue is comparatively simple . As in most cases , it is a matter of containment , of separate spheres of influence . The Pass-Fail Option must itself be made optional , with each instructor deciding whether or not to allow it in his courses . Wearily summoning up his usual casually authoritative manner , Brian suggests that they recommend this to the department . And , after some routine oratory , his suggestion is accepted . Brian tries to accelerate the rest of the meeting , but it is past four when he returns to his office . He shuts the door but does not turn on the light , so as not to be interrupted while he plans his counteroffensive . Fortunately , he has not yet committed himself to any position.  |p175Although  stunned by Erica 's assault , he had somehow retained his presence of mind : he had not said anything unforgivably insulting . More important , though moved by pity and concern for Wendy , he had not promised her anything . He must begin , Brian decides , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must separate his opponents . First , and most important , he must separate Wendy physically from Danielle so that he can talk to her alone . Even so , the interview will not be easy . Wendy will be disappointed , badly disappointed ; and hurt even more than she has already been hurt  --  he can see her face now , her bruised bare feet . But she is not the only one ; Brian himself feels a kind of sick physical despair to think that never again  --  Her bare legs , her wide small rumpBut why never again ? a voice remarks in his head . After all this is over , after Wendy has been to New York and this must be arranged for as soon as possible  --  Of course they will have to be extraordinarily discreet from now on , he will tell her . He will hold her strongly , speak to her gently , explain what is best for all of them . He will speak of her graduate fellowship , of Erica 's precarious mental condition , of his book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perhaps , quietly , he will point out how much trouble and pain there has been because she did n't trust him  --  did n't confide in him and let him take the responsibility , make the decisions . And she will trust him ; she will be grateful , because in spite of her panic and errors of judgment it is not " the end of everything , " and he still cares for her , wants her . Brian sits down at his desk in the fading light and dials Danielle 's number ; but at the sound of Danielle 's voice he hangs up . He looks at the phone , considering whether he should call again and demand to speak to Wendy . But perhaps it would be better to see Erica first , to get that over with . Then he can phone and suggest that Wendy meet him somewhere . If he ca n't get past Danielle , he will go to the house and remove her  --  by force if necessary , as Dibble would recommend . The interview with Erica will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Erica 's feelings are more complicated . Wendy loves him ; Danielle hates him . But his wife is caught in a cross fire of emotions ; not only love and hate but jealousy , pity , shame , fear he can see her now driven back andforth between them from one end of the sitting-room rug to theother . He sees her white feverish face and next to it , Wendy'sface , staring at him with the same distracted fixity . The two faces , the four eyes , move together and merge into one . The unwelcome thought comes to Brian that two women who were in reasonably good shape when he met them are now , somewhat as a result of his actions , on the verge of nervous collapse . That he has n't intended this , that he is in fact extremely fond of them both , would be no defense to anyone who knew his history ; and if he does not act now with great decisiveness and diplomacy , everyone will know it . Erica will be hard to deal with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared for this . She will perhaps always be convinced that she was right , just as she still believes she was right about rooming in . ( Even now she sometimes harks back to this , blaming Matilda 's problems on the fact that her mother was overruled by the Boston Lying-In Hospital thirteen years ago . ) And once Erica realizes that she has been overruled again there is no guarantee that she will accept it gracefully ; that she will cease hostilities and let him move back into the house . But why should he need her permission ? Is it not his house , coming home today  --  better yet , if he just comes home  --  she may not like it ; but what can she do about it ? She may sulk , but she is not going to call the police or become violent . Danielle Zimmern once threw a can of Snow 's New England Clam Chowder at Leonard ( she missed ) , but Erica has never within his memory raised her hand against anyone . When the children were too young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry them into another room away from some forbiddenp177object , rather than slap them sometimes over and over again , with a stubborn womanly patience he could only marvel at . Even after he has reoccupied his own territory there will be difficulties in pacifying the natives . He must resign himself to a long , hard campaign . He must arm himself this time with better arguments , including those suggested in imagination by his colleagues . He must , like Chuck , defend self-determination ; like Randall he must speak of responsibility  --  of his and Erica 's moral obligation to carry out their sworn promises to each other , to society , and above all to Jeffrey and Matilda . He must point out to Erica that her plan was not only against her own interests which in her present martyr 's mood will hardly weigh with her  --  but against the interests of The Children . How could she think of exposing them to so much pain , disruption and scandal ? These arguments must convince her , since they are true . But even if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he loves her and prefers her to Wendy and all other women , must prevail . Of course as long as Erica goes on seeing the abhorrent Danielle , his campaign will be twice as difficult . He must begin as soon as possible to separate them , pointing out at every opportunity  --  butsubtly how aggressive and unfeminine Danielle is , how hostile she has always been to men , and specifically to him . Erica is loyal to Danielle out of habit , because they were in college together , and such habits are hard to break . But she must realize that people change , not always for the better . After all , Danielle is not the only possible friend in town . Among the wives of his colleagues there are many pleasant , normal women . It is quite dark in Brian 's office when he leaves , but outside the air is still saturated with dull gray light . The clouds hang low , heavy and fuzzy , though it is not actually drizzling . As he stops for the traffic signal by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpleasant thing crossing in front of his car : a sort of faceless , headless dwarf in black galoshes with a dirty burlap bag pulledp178down over most of its body . Though this formless thing does not seem to notice Brian , who is also protected from it by the metal armor of his Karmann Ghia , his breath stops ; he feels shock , dread . Then , ahead , coming toward him along the sidewalk in the damp dusk , he notices two more uncanny dwarfish figures : one red with horns and the other wrapped in a sheet . Of course ; it is Halloween . He breathes . The light changes and he drives on , passing on his way home other children dressed as skeletons , pirates , Mickey Mouse , Dracula , Batman , and other conventional monsters . It is still light enough for him to remark again how disreputablehis yard looks . The grass is strewn with broken twigs and damp leaves , and in places with rotting wormy apples . Even more offensive are the overturned cans by the drive , spilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravel and grass . The dogs of Glenview Heights have been at their trash again , and no one has done anything about it . Trying to set aside his disgust and anger , to compose himself for the coming battle , Brian enters the house . He is aware first of rock music soaking down from above ; next that all the lights are burning in the empty kitchen , the refrigerator door is partly open , and there is food abandoned on the table : a box leaking crackers , a carton of milk souring , smeary jars of peanut butter and jam . " Erica ? " There is no reply . He turns off the light , slams the refrigerator door , and walks through to the sitting room . Slouched down on the sofa , reading a comic book and eating a leaky sandwich , is a skinny adolescent boy with thick wire-rimmed spectacles , long dirty blond hair , and acne . " Jeffrey . Is Mom home ? " Jeffrey looks up briefly , chewing , and returns to his comic . " Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those muddy shoes off the table . " " I did answer you . " " Excuse me , you did not . "  | " I shook my head , " Jeffrey says in a sullen argumentative voice , not moving his feet . " That 's an answer , is n't it ? " " Not a very polite one . " Brian waits , but his son remains silent . " Where is she , then ? " " Idunno , " Jeffrey mumbles , spitting crumbs . " She wenout . " " Mm . " Brian paces back the length of the carpet and looks out the window , noticing  --  as he would have noticed sooner if he were in a calmer state of mind  --  that Erica 's car is not parked in the driveway next to the overturned cans . " Jeffo , I 'd like you to do something about the yard , " he announces , attempting to speak pleasantly , even humorously . " I 've only been gone two days , and already the place looks like a suburban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not glancing up . " The lawn needs to be raked . And there are a lot of twigs and branches down ; you 'd better stack them by the back wall . The leaves and apples can go onto the compost heap . And I 'd like you to pick up that garbage . Those idiot dogs have got into it again , because somebody forgot to put the rocks on top of the cans . . . You know , " he adds conversationally , " it seems to me you should n't have to be told about this sort of thing . You 're getting old enough now to take some responsibility for the place , to notice when you come home from school if something needs to be done , and attend to it . " There is no visible response to this speech . Jeffrey turns a page of his comic book . " So come on , now , " Brian continues , speaking louder and a little less pleasantly . " Go outside and get started on the job , before you forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop persecuting me , okay ? " he asks in a tone of deep grievance . " I 'll do it later . " " I want you to do it now . " Brian keeps his voice even with difficulty . " And while you 're at it , you can clean up that mess you left in the kitchen . " " I did n't leave any mess ! " Jeffrey slams his comic down on thep180sofa . " Why do you always blame everything on me , huh ? If there 's any crap in the kitchen , it 's Muffy 's crap . Whydoncha ask her to clean it up ? " Brian represses a comment on his son 's choice of language . " All right , I will . And you get to work on the yard , okay ? " The rock music intensifies as Brian climbs the stairs ; soon he can make out the words , which express crude , clamorous physicality . He thinks , as he has thought before , how disagreeable and unsuitable such music is for a thirteen-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut up for hours every day with those obscene noises , how can she retain any real innocence ? On the third-floor landing the frenetic pulsing and shouting are intolerable , and his knock inaudible . So , apparently , is his voice . " Matilda ? Are you there , Matilda ? " Receiving no answer , Brian opens the door . A fat witch is in the attic bedroom , standing with her back to him before a mirror . She wears the traditional filthy black skirt and cape , with peculiarly stringy and shiny long black hair falling from under a tall cardboard hat . " GOTCHA BOOM BOOM , " screams a hoarse licentious male voice from opposite speakers , as if summoning the fat witch to a Black Mass . " Matilda ! " Brian shouts . The witch turns . Beneath the pointed hat and straggling black plastic hair is a plump young painted face , chalk-white and hideously asymmetrical . One eye has been outlined and rayed in electric blue and black so that it resembles a huge spider ; the other eye is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please ! I 'd like to speak to you ! " With an air of sulky weariness the witch crouches and reduces the volume minimally . " GOTCHA Boom Boom . . . "  | " I wanted to ask you , Muffy  --  I said , turn it down so you can hear what I have to say . " " I can hear you now . " Exasperated , Brian crosses the room and turns off the record player . " Boommmmm . " " You 're ruining my Stones record ! " Matilda wails , snatching the tone arm off . " And you 're ruining your hearing , playing the phonograph so loud , do you realize that ? " he retorts . " I 've already told you , and I 'm sure your mother  --  " " I can hear better than you can , " Matilda interrupts spitefully , turning her back on Brian and continuing with her make-up . " That 's not the point , Matilda . It 's a gradual process . " No response ; his daughter is frowning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them until they meet above her snub nose in a hag 's scowl . " Your hearing may be all right now , but if you do n't take care of it , by the time you 're my age you may be sorry . " No response . Matilda begins to smear her other eyelid with blue grease . Presently , when both eyes are spiders , she will go out with a shopping bag and show them to the whole neighborhood . " You know , Muffy , a witch does n't have to be grotesque . You 're an attractive young girl ; I should think you 'd want to look pretty when you go trick-or-treating . " Though he has spoken mildly , Matilda 's reaction is a howl . " Aw , cowplop ! What 's the good of trying to look pretty , long as I 've got these ? " She rounds on him , grinning fiendishly to reveal a mouthful of metal braces laced with damp rubber bands . " And I 'm not going trick-or-treating . What do you think I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed up like that for ? " " I 'm invited to Elsie 's slumber party . " " Oh ? And what is a slumber party ? " " Do n't you even know that ? You have a party , and then you sleep overnight . " " Overnight ? You 're too young to stay out overnight . "  | " Mom said I could . " Matilda pulls the bottom lid of her right eye down hideously while she lines it in black crayon . " Well , I say you ca n't . " Brian makes a mental note to speak to Erica . If she gave any such consent , it must have been in a moment of distraction . " If you want to go out in the neighborhood that 's all right , as long as you 're home by nine , " he adds generously . " But I already told Elsie I 'm coming ! " His daughter 's voice rises steeply . " Then you 'll have to tell her you 're not . " Under the witch 's hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foul expression she has painted onto it . " I do n't have to do what you tell me , " she declares . " You 're not my boss . " As if to prove this she squats down in her black skirt and restarts the phonograph . " No , but I 'm your father , and I want " Brian begins , but he is shouted down by sex-crazed voices as the volume rises : " awah booM BOOM GOTCHA ! " He is aware that he should turn the machine off again , should carry the battle with his daughter through ; but a feeling of disgust and exhaustion has overtaken him . Erica is responsible for this insurrection ; let her handle it . He turns and leaves the room . As he descends the stairs , pursued by the lewd shouting and panting , he thinks how when he first met Erica her two favorite albums were the Bach double-violin concerto and some old English ballads sung to a dulcimer , of which he remembers best a song about a fair maid who followed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eagerly setting the heavy waxy old black 78s on a wheezy phonograph in the living room of her Radcliffe dormitory for him to hear . She would go with him wherever he chose to go , the song seemed to declare , some weeks before Erica herself declared it ; her life would flow after and into his as Bach 's second violin gracefully echoed and joined the first . A choking feeling comes over Brian ; he leans for a moment against the stairway wallpaper , but Matilda 's infernal music drives him on down.  |p183In  the sitting room Jeffrey has not moved , except to slump lower on his spine behind Plastic Man Comics . " I thought I told you to clean up the yard , " Brian says , standing over him . " S'too dark out , " his son mumbles through an apple core . " Do it tomorrow . " " I want you to do it now . " " I said I 'd do it tomorrow , awright ? " Jeffrey brays , finally looking up at his father with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wouldja leave me alone now , so I can read ? " Brian feels a pounding in his chest . " You 're not reading ! " he explodes . " You 're just rotting your mind with childish trash . When I was fifteen I read Gibbon , but I have n't seen you with a book , outside of homework , for weeks . Do you have any homework today , by the way ? . . . Jeffrey , I asked you a question . " " Oh , why do n't you fuck off . " " Do n't speak to me like that . " He pulls Plastic Man out of his son 's hands . " Gim me back my comic ! " Jeffrey yelps , rising angrily , clumsily . Over the summer he has grown to be nearly as tall as Brian , though he probably still weighs twenty pounds less . If it came to a physical struggle Brian holds the comic behind his back , gripping it tighter . " I 'll give it back after you 've done your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture , but does not carry it through . " Awright , awright , " he growls . " If you 'll get the fuck out of my way . " Having won , Brian overlooks the obscenity ; he stands aside , and Jeffrey slouches grumbling from the room . Five o'clock ; and Erica is not back yet . Brian frowns and goes into the kitchen to check his watch . The sight of food still spoiling on the table reminds him that he has neglected to tell Matilda to clean up , or to ask when her mother will be home . His Timex is accurate , but the times are out of joint . He feels exhausted , persecuted ; his heart is still pumping . Brian has neverp184cared much for children in general , but for years his own children have been the exception . He has treated them affectionately , seriously , fairly . Then why should he now have a son like Jeffrey , so sullen and selfish : a son who when other boys are out raking leaves or playing football sits slumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should he have a daughter like Matilda , so painfully different from the gentle pretty daughter he had wanted and expected : a pudgy , whiny , sulky child who battens upon the commercial screams of sexual delinquents while disguising herself as a witch ? Suddenly the idea comes to him that it is not a disguise that the scowling adolescent hag upstairs is Matilda 's true self , just as Jeffrey is in some profound sense a plastic man ; that all the monstrous children he passed this afternoon on his way home , dressed as devils , ghosts , Dracula , etc. , have merely made their real natures visible , this one day of the year . As he walks about the kitchen waiting , very impatiently now , for Erica , Brian thinks how unfair it is that he should be insulted as he has just been by his children , and threatened  --  yes , even physically threatened , there was that in Jeffrey 's voice and stance . And Jeffrey is still growing ; presently he will be taller than Brian and weigh more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large for her age . It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that one day Brian Tate will be the smallest person in his family . That he should have to listen to the daily insults and threats of these monstrous adolescents , to live in the same house with them  --  The irritated muttering in Brian 's head halts . Another clearer , louder voice remarks that he does not have to live in this house ; that in fact all those concerned are concerned to put him out ; that he is there now to argue and plead to be allowed to remain " for the sake of The Children . " That is , for the sake of Jeffrey and Matilda , who obviously would not care if they never saw him again . He must be crazy . Why should he do anything for the sake of such children ? Why should he stay here to be insulted and threatened by them ; to be scolded and blamed by his wife ?  |p185Considering  what she has made of them , what right has she to judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or rather to he charitable  --  failed to prevent . Let him go where he is wanted , listened to , passionately loved . Brian looks out the window again , but this time to make sure his wife is not coming home . Hastily , before she can do so , he retrieves his briefcase , raincoat and overnight bag , and leaves the house . Jeffrey is in the side yard , raking up apples with the wrong , or garden , rake , which is very bad for the lawn ; but Brian does not stop to correct him . He gets into his car , starts the engine , and drives off into the damp , cold , darkening afternoon.  |p186It  is the day after Thanksgiving . Erica is up in the storeroom sorting clothes : putting summer dresses away in cloudy plastic bags and taking winter skirts and coats out . She is alone in the house , for Jeffrey and Matilda are in Connecticut with Brian 's mother and aunt ; but she is not lonely . She has not been lonely , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first she had hardly believed her feelings ; she kept waiting for the reaction . Instead , day after day , there was only the euphoria of freedom joy and relief at having Brian out of the house for good  --  in every sense for good . Cleaning out his chest of drawers , she felt no nostalgia  --  only a faint distaste for all those identical rolled dark-brown Orlon socks clustered together like horse droppings , for the pale shirts ( 141/2 32 ) pressed bone-stiff in their cellophane bags . She took everything out and packed it into cardboard cartons ; then she scrubbed the drawers with detergent and hot water , and relined them with fresh shiny blue-flowered contact paper . She dusted and waxed the empty bookshelves in the study . Suddenly there was so much space in the house ! She could walk through it , from room to room , and make everything rightp187everywhere . She could take down the ugly yellow-varnished antique maps Brian had hung in the hall ; she could move the best reading lamp , which he had somehow appropriated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could trade in the ugly , clumsy Jar of Peanut Butter for a nice little blue VW station wagon that can park anywhere . She can do what she likes now in her house ; she can wear what she likes and cook what she likes . Brian will not come home at five-thirty tonight or any night to criticize the salad dressing or blame her for Jeffrey 's table manners or the fact that the plumber has n't come yet to fix the drip in the downstairs bathroom . She need n't ask his permission to buy new curtains or have Danielle to dinner . And she does n't have to plead and reason with him if she wants to take a part-time job : all she need do is call the placement office as she did last week and say she can start on Monday . It vexes her that the job she has started is not as good as the one Brian forced her to decline : November is the wrong time to seek employment , and the best they could offer her was fifteen hours a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is a start . More important , she has begun to draw seriously again . There is gradually taking shape in her mind a new children 's book , about a hare who lives in the northern forest , and turns white when the snow comes . She is not sure of the plot yet , but she has already completed some of the illustrations : large , delicately detailed ink-and-wash drawings . Thinking of her book , Erica turns to the attic window . This is the one room which still has a view uninterrupted by ranch homes ; it looks away from the city of Corinth over rising fields and woods bleached and stripped for the coming winter . As a local painter once remarked , nature is an instinctive psychologist of color : in summer she soothes the eye with cool greens and blues , but when the weather turns cold she puts on warmer hues . The late autumn landscape is all done in beautiful pale reds and browns , freckledp188with white from the first light snow . She must draw her next scene like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , the road there , the long field sloping upErica rests her elbows on the sill , looking out over the lovely empty world , contemplating with wonder her own state of mind . She had expected to feel some moments of painful satisfaction at having made the right decision about Wendy , but not this continuing joy . Is it true , after all , that virtue is rewarded ? Of course there have been some difficult moments . But she would not have had it otherwise : without them , her happiness might have seemed too dreamlike ; almost unreal . Many of these moments have come about because she is still outwardly living a lie , though not one of her own choosing . As yet the real story behind the separation is known only to Danielle and to Wendy 's roommate . Everyone else in Corinth believes that the Tates have parted because of mutual dislike . It is Brian , of course , who has invented this fiction . He has made her promise to conceal the truth until after their divorce  --  in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really himself he wishes to protect , for Wendy has no social shame , and would be proud to announce her condition from the steps of the college library through a microphone . Erica acceded to her husband 's demand very reluctantly . In her view it was not only dishonest but foolish . It would not prevent scandal , but merely postpone it  --  and very likely accentuate it . For now , when the real facts are uncovered , one of them will be that Brian and Erica have been lying to all their acquaintances for several months . Already many of these acquaintances are not satisfied with the report of mutual incompatability ; they want to know the details . Was it sex ? money ? relatives ? drink ? They have invited Erica to lunch and to parties in order to pursue the investigation . Usually she has gone , and smilingly endured their covert or overt scrutiny , their pitying and prying remarks ; she has met their tactful or tactless inquiries with calm self-possession . This restraint was painful at first , but she kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon enough . Then they would remember how she had said with a fine smile that this separation was the best thing for everyone . By now she no longer regrets her promise to Brian ; she feels as if she were walking through the world carrying within her a wonderful secret , which like Wendy 's child grows larger every day . Concealing the facts from her own children has been harder . She and Brian had given out the official version together at a special family council ; they had decided beforehand , not without acrimony , what to say . Brian had wanted to break the news gradually , and speak now only of a temporary separation . But she had insisted that even if they did n't tell the whole truth , they must not tell any lies which the children would remember later . They must n't promise that the separation would be temporary ; Brian mus n't say that he had to be alone because of his work . She had spent wearisome hours convincing him of this , and more hours devising honest but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask . When the council finally took place it was anticlimactic . Brian and Erica made the short , neutral statement they had agreed upon ; Jeffrey and Matilda received it stolidly , without apparent curiosity . Pressed for an opinion , they became even blanker . Their father was going to be away from home for a while  --  but he had been away before , lecturing and at conferences ; and this time he would still be in town and would see them regularly . So what was the big deal ? It was okay by them . No , they had no questions . During the next few days , however , both Jeffrey and Matilda approached their mother separately . Erica had anticipated and even hoped for this . When Matilda asked how long Dad was going to be gone , she had her answer ready ( " I ca n't say now . It depends on a lot of things . .. " ) . As she spoke she looked at her daughter and felt , for the first time in months , a deep rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a child , Muffy had been strikingly pretty , like her mother : slim , graceful , elfin . Now , at thirteen-and-a-half , she was pudgy and shapeless.  |p190Her  beautiful pale brown silk hair had been split and roughened and streaked orange by cheap dyes ; her mouth was full of orthodontic hardware . But beneath this appearance , beneath the badly patched jeans and the baggy sweatshirt with ZOWIE ! printed on it in comic-book lettering , was  --  or one day would be  --  a woman like Erica herself . Like Erica  --  or Danielle , or Wendy  --  Matilda would grow up , fall in love , have children , and be disillusioned by some man . And this man already existed , somewhere in the world . At that moment , wherever he was standing in line for a Thanksgiving film matinee in some small town or big city , walking in the country , playing football in a vacant lot , or in some college stadium  --  he was slowly moving , walking , running toward this house , toward Matilda . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would get there , and get at her , and it would all begin over again. . . so we just have to wait and see , " Erica concluded , touching the shoulder of Matilda 's pink ZOWIE ! sweatshirt gently . " You think Dad could be gone a month , maybe ? " " He might . " Erica smiled , conscious of all she could not say now , would be able to say later . " If he does n't come back " Matilda looked up at her intently , as if she had understood somehow , instinctively  --  as if she knew that Brian would not come back , and was glad of it . " Yes , ducky . " " Well then , Mummy . " Muffy 's eyes lit , and she spoke with her old warm , childish eagerness . " Can we get a TV ? " " Certainly not . " Erica ceased to smile . " Why not ? You said it was Dad who did n't like TV . " " He does n't like it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control herself and speak more evenly . " You said you did n't care . " " I did not , Matilda . " " You did too . Anyhow , what about majority rule ? It 's two against one now , because Jeffrey wants TV too . . . Oh yeh ? . . . You always give us this bullshit about fairness andp191democracy , but you do n't mean it . . . phony . . . mean . . . " She continued in this manner for some time , becoming first whinily insistent and then abusive , finally referring to her parents as " senile freaks . " Erica managed to remain calm , even forgiving . She looked at the mouthful of metal and rubber from which this abuse was issuing and thought of the fairy tale in which every word the ugly daughter utters comes out a toad . It was really as if Muffy had fallen under a bad spell the spell of Brian 's lies . If Erica could have told her the truth she would have had other things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be taking place . When Jeffrey accosted her a few days later Erica was more on her guard . He appeared at the kitchen door when she was cooking supper , and barked , " Hey . What 's for eats tonight ? " " Kangaroo burgers , baked kangaroos and kangaroo sticks . " This was an old family joke , meaning that the answer to a question was obvious , just as now : the hamburgers were simmering in onion sauce on the stove , the potatoes visible through the oven door , and she was at that moment scraping a carrot under the tap . " I just asked , " Jeffrey grumbled , not smiling . He slouched into the room and remarked in the same noisy , offhand way , " Listen : this business of Dad moving out . I do n't get it . " " Really ? " Erica stopped scraping . " What do n't you get ? " " The whole scene . I mean , you do n't fight or anything , like Joey 's parents . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart for a while . " " But what 's the hassle then ? How come you ca n't hack it with Dad ? " Jeffrey continued in the hip speech he has begun to affect . " I mean , he zaps everybody sometimes , but he 's not basically such a bad cat . " " I 'm afraid I ca n't explain it to you now . " She smiled at him , conscious of exerting calm patience . " When can you explain it ? " Jeffrey began to drum with the joined fingers of one hand against the counter , an irritating nervous gesture that he must have picked up from Brian.  | " I do n't really know . " She shut off the faucet and laid the wet carrots on the cutting board which Jeffrey had made for her in seventh-grade shop , when he was all right and everything was all right . " It depends on a lot of things  --  " But Jeffrey , unlike his sister , did not wait to hear the prepared speech through . " Yeh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkwardly . " Only you never tell us anything . It 's just , like stupid . " " Please do n't interrupt me , Jeffrey . I 'm telling you something now . I was saying that when two people have differences , they may not know right away whether " " What differences , man ? " "  --  whether they will turn out to be unimportant , or not ; they may need time to think things over and consider them , " she continued , chopping the carrots into small strips with a knife . " That 's why we all have to  --  " " Oh , fuck it , " Jeffrey exclaimed . He turned and left the kitchen loudly , and Erica did not forgive him as she had forgiven Matilda . Nor does she forgive him now . For one thing , he is older than Matilda : he is fifteen , not a child . He should realize that there might be things she can not tell him yet ; he should have the tact And why should he assume the separation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it "  --  whatever that means and tell her that Brian is not a bad cat ? That 's what you think , Erica says to herself , reviewing the conversation as she looks out the attic window over the winter landscape . And it occurs to her that Brian is , precisely , a bad cat ; she recalls a specific former local cat , a sneaky prowling torn named George who lived on Jones Creek Road when the Tates first moved there . George , who belonged to a nearby farmer , habitually killed songbirds , and twice in rapid succession knocked up the Tates ' Flopsy before they had her fixed . Flopsy died of old age and overeating two years ago ; and George is dead long since , his back broken by a truck hauling out dirt from the first of the Glenview Homes , but Erica has not forgiven him.  |p193Jeffrey  blames her already , she thinks , though he knows nothing about the separation . When she can answer all his questions , will he change his mind ? She is not sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another manner has begun to appear : a noisy male coarseness of speech and gesture . Picking him up after school , she has seen him ( before he saw her ) in a group of loutish half-grown boys , all laughing grossly and shoving each other as a group of girls passed . She has found a magazine called Penthouse among the candy wrappers and grit and wads of used tissue under his unmade bed . Perhaps , even when he knows the truth , Jeffrey may think his father not such a bad cat . But Matilda will understand ; as time passes she will understandbetter and better what Erica has done , and sympathize more and more with Wendy , a woman like herself ; indeed a girl not much older than she . The shadows of high clouds pass over the fields beyond Erica 's attic window , stippling the ground with paler and darker patches of light , like an impressionist painting ; and a similar effect of light passes over her mind as she thinks of Wendy . She smiles , recalling Wendy 's affection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstetrician recommended by Erica , and of Erica 's understandingwhen she has morning sickness or cramps in her legs ( appreciating it even more because Brian is impatient with such complaints ) ; her new look of health and enthusiastic happiness . Perhaps at times Wendy 's happiness is too enthusiastic : the truth is that , unlike Erica , she is a good loser but a poor winner . In defeat she is gentle and resigned ; in victory she has a tendency to exult , even to crow . But , considering everything , Erica does not find this very hard to overlook . What disconcerts her more is Wendy 's blind admiration of Brian . That she should love him and believe in him is of course desirable ; but she seems to have no ability to judge him in anything , let alone oppose him . And without this moral independenceit will be hard for her to be a really good mother , for there are moments when even the best husband must be overridden . ( Ericap194recalls , as she often does , how Brian once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York although Jeffrey looked flushed and had a low fever . " It 's nothing , " he had insisted ; but it was German measles . ) It is clear to her already , though not to Wendy , that Brian is not sufficiently aware of his responsibility to the baby ; that his attitude toward it is impatient and peevish . For instance , Wendy tried recently to talk to him about names . She wanted to give the child a unique , meaningful name ; among those she and Linda liked , she said , were Laurel and Lavender . Or if it was a boy , perhaps Sage . " Why not Spinach or Cabbage ? " Brian had scoffed . But Wendy attributed his callousness to the fact that she had approached him at a bad moment . ( " It was all my fault really . I 'm so dumb ; I 'm always interrupting him when he 's trying to concentrate . " ) She will have to stand by Wendy after the child comes , to watch over them both . The prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she frowns , recalling that it is almost a week since she last saw Wendy . They had planned to meet for coffee on campus Tuesday , but at the last moment Wendy could n't come because Brian needed her to read proofs of an article out loud to him . Erica suspects this excuse ; but she does not suspect Wendy . She believes that Brian heard of their appointment and invented the need to read proofs ; she thinks he is deliberately trying to discourage their meeting for some reason perhaps social embarrassment , perhaps mere jealous spite . Men are often jealous and suspicious of friendship between women , though they value it among themselves . According to Danielle 's feminist friends , this is because it contradicts their idea of women as lacking the political virtues , as desiring neither liberty , equality nor fraternity . ( " You notice you never hear anyone talk about sorority . " ) We are held to be capable of devotion to our husbands and children , but catty and competitive with all other women , without true affection for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , that women are farp195better friends to each other than men are . We are not naturally so selfish and aggressive , and we do not have to be . Brian is directly in competition with his " friends " in the political science department here , and indirectly with those elsewhere . Or , if they are much older ( or younger ) than he , he looks to them ( or they to him ) for professional advantage . Only rarely , as with Leonard Zimmern , can he have a friendship untainted by either rivalry or calculation  --  and then it must lack professional intimacy , for Leonard is in another field . Women , however , are all in the same field , yet not in competition . Brian must hoard his ideas for publication ; but if she passes on a new recipe she earns her friend 's gratitude and loses nothing . Another cloud passes over the sun , shadowing the view . Erica recalls that her children will be arriving on the bus from New York in less than an hour . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper closets , put on her coat , and drive downtown . Conscientiously , she follows this program . But at the bus station she is informed both by a hand-printed sign on the counter and by a rude young man behind it that the 3:20 from New York will be an hour late . To pass the time she decides to go to the library . Leaving her car , she walks up the shabby end of Main Street , by cheap small groceries , bars , beauty shops , garages , a Chinese restaurant and a narrow store she does n't remember having noticed : the Krishna Bookshop . Erica halts . For weeks , in the retroactive amnesia which follows upon shock , she has forgotten Sandy Finkelstein . Now she remembers that her old Cambridge acquaintance , or someone else of the same name , is the proprietor of this shop . Beyond the printed sign hanging inside the glass door ( YES , WE 'RE OPEN ) is a narrow room lined with bookshelves , occupied by two people . One is a girl with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . His back is turned to Erica , but something about the uneven droop of his shoulders , the way he now reaches up one long arm for a book , seems familiar.  |p196Erica  pushes the door open . The man glances around at her briefly , nods but with no sign of recognition bends to retrieve a book he has just dropped , turns back , and continues his conversation . She advances two steps into the store , and stops beside a colored astrological poster , uncertain . That man looks too old , too bald ; also he did n't seem to know her . Perhaps she only imagined it was Sandy . Talking rather excitedly ( something about the new moon ) the fuzzy-haired girl walks past Erica to the front desk , followed by Sandy 's aging namesake . She hands him money , receives change and the wrapped book , and leaves with friendly exclamations : " You ought a come out to the farm again for dinner , okay ? How about tomorrow ? " " I 'll be happy to , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandy 's voice  --  gentle , light , dry . " Oh , no problem . Mike or Stanley ought a be coming in with the truck sometime . I 'll tell them to stop on their way home and pick you up , okay ? " " Fine . " But if it really is Sandy , he is sadly changed . He looks tired out , shabby , in poor condition . His face , with its blurred pale scarecrow features , is badly creased around the eyes ; and the thick energetic red hair which was one of Sandy 's few good points has faded and slid down off his head , as if with exhaustion . It lies now in dingy rusted curls around the base of the freckled crown . " See you tomorrow , then . " " Peace , Jenny . " Jenny makes a peace sign in return , hunches her shoulders under the heavy coat and goes out . Zed follows her to the door and reverses the sign hanging on it so that the other side faces out ( SORRY , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his back to the door , looking across the shop at Erica , smiling , but very slightly.  | " Are n't you Sanford Finkelstein ? " she asks , also smiling , mainly with embarrassment . " I was . " " You were ? " " Are you Erica Parker ? " " I was . " Erica smiles fully , then laughs . " Sandy " She moves nearer , holding out her hand . Zed hesitates , then takes it with his , which feels dry and cold . " I 'm awfully happy to see you again , " he says . " Yes , so am I. " This was one of the nicest things about Sandy , she recalls : his childlike directness . But how changed and worn he is ! He looks older than Brian , though he must be four or five years younger , and his freckled skin is lined and gray . She might not have recognized him on the street , except possibly for his eyes , which are still pale and wide under sandy eyebrows with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it been , eight or nine years ? " " Nearly ten . We met at the ballet in New York just before Christmas in 1959 . " " Did we ? " Erica frowns . " Yes , I think I remember . What ballet was it ? " " The Nutcracker . You had on a purple dress and were with your son , and another little boy named Freddy and his mother . She was very pregnant . " " Emmy Turner . That must have been just before she had Hannah . What a fantastic memory ! You probably still know all those Greek verbs , too , that I 've completely forgotten . " " Some of them . " " I thought you were in Japan . " " I was in Japan . " " But you came back . " " Apparently . " Erica laughs again ; she recalls this tone , and looks at Zed with reminiscent affection . " You know , you 've been here all year , and I never knew it until about a , week ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politeness.  | " Yes . I thought that . " " You thought that ? You mean you knew I was here in Corinth ? " He nods . " You should have called me . " He shrugs . This too she remembers about Sandy : his shyness and lack of social initiative . He was always willing to accompany her wherever shehappened to be going , at any time to Sage 's grocery , the library , the Fine Arts Museum in Boston , or Filene 's Basement but heseldom suggested any excursion himself ; and when invited to a party he usually did not come . " I do n't like telephones . Evil spirits of the air , a friend of mine in Tokyo calls them . " " But in Cambridge " " I did n't like them then either . I never phoned if I could help it ; I always came over to Edwards House to see you , if you remember . " " You did n't come to see me here . " Erica smiles , but she is thinking that perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the children of this pale , shabby ghost from her past ; their probable impatience and irritation , even rudeness ; the probable effect of this rudeness on him " I do n't like automobiles . " Zed glances toward the street , where automobiles are parked , with a grimace she remembers well . " No . That 's not the whole truth . I thought of calling , or getting somebody to give me a ride out to your house . But then I thought , If it was meant to happen , it would happen . God 's will . " He smiles oddly , and looks at Erica . " Would you like some tea ? " " Yes , that would be nice . " " It 'll take a few minutes . " Zed goes to the back of the shop and passes behind a curtain made of faded orange-striped madras bedspread . There is the sound of water running unevenly . She waits , looking at the shelves which line the room , the books with odd titles and obscure publishers , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You give lectures here , as well as selling books ? " she says when Zed reappears.  | " Not really . Seminars . I do n't perform like Levin or Jaeger . I could n't if I wanted to ; and I do n't want to . Though that 's what they 'd like , most of the people who come . " Zed grins . " Because they 're lazy , you mean ? " " Not so much lazy as intellectually passive . A lot of kids get interested in mysticism because it looks like a way out of all the pressure that 's on them . A way out of the system . " " And they 're wrong ? " " No , they 're right . But that does n't mean there 's no work involved . Not just study  --  they do n't usually object to that ; they 're used to it . They 'll do anything you tell them , really . Except think . " Zed smiles . " They have this idea that the Path is a sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any serious effort on their part . If they have questions , they think all they have to do is ask me . " " But if you know the answers " Erica tries to keep irony out of her voice . She does n't want to mock Sandy ; she is sorry for him , and mildly curious . " I do n't know the answers , " Zed says impatiently . He sighs and leans back against a shelf , where his elbows make two indentations in a row of works on alchemy . She can see the nearer one , white and knobby , through a raveled hole in his gray sweater . " I tell the kids who come in here , Do n't lay that guru trip on me . I 'm not qualified . ' I know something about meditation , and I can tell them what books to read , and what not to do if they want to get onto the Path , and that 's about all . If they want a real teacher they 've got to go somewhere else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . Or the Far East . There 's the kettle . " He straightens up . This time Erica follows him down the dingy narrow room and past the bedspread to another even narrower and dingier room . Shelves and cartons of books take up most of the space , along with a narrow studio couch . In one corner there is a paint-streaked sink with dishes and pans stacked on the ledge beside it , and a row of canned goods , tomato soup and peas and applesauce , above.  |p200Hanging  from nails are what must be Sandy 's clothes : a long overcoat , two long-armed wool shirts and some crumpled striped pajamas . " Do you live here , too ? " she asks . " It 's convenient . " Zed shrugs . " And cheap . " The kettle is wheezing and spitting ; he lifts it from the hot plate and tries to pour into a teapot on the shelf above . " Oh , blast . " As the hot water slops over , and he grabs for something to mop up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . Sandy is sitting opposite her at one of the small square tables in Schrafft 's on Brattle Street . In front of each of them is a glazed paper doily with spiderweb designs punched out in opposite corners , and a cup and saucer with a green S monogram in Gothic script . Sandy raises the dark-green teapot and tilts it over her cup , and its oval top falls off , slopping hot water on the varnished wood . She can hear him cry " Oh , blast , " just as he did now , and see him lifting aside the cups and the silvery aluminum sugar bowl with its two handles like arms akimbo , and the plate of cinnamon toast cut into four parallel strips ; mopping up awkwardly with his own and then her paper napkin ; finally bending under the table to retrieve the top of the pot , because no one in rural Waterford , New York , ever taught him that you do n't pick things up off the floor in restaurants . It is not , however , an instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Erica has thought of this scene many times , because it took place during the most important conversationof her and Sandy 's acquaintance . The subject of this conversationwas , Whether it is worth doing anything after you realize you will never be first-rate at it . Or , as he put it referring to a philosophy essay on which he had labored for three weeks  --  " if you know it will always be an A-minus , never an A. Once you 're sure of this , should n't you just quit the field ? " But Erica , who had the same problem , found herself taking the other side . As Sandy rose into view above the table again with his red hair awry and the top of the teapot in one hand , she heard herp201own voice maintaining a position she had not , up to that moment , known she held . You did n't leave the field , she insisted ; you only moved to another part of it , where the ground was n't so hard . Take her cousin at MIT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , but he would still be a good engineer . Or suppose , like her , you knew you probably were n't going to become a first-rate painter , she went on with conviction , gazing across the damp table at Sandy . You did n't give up art . Instead you concentrated on what you could do , did n't he see ? Which in her case was small amusing line drawings . " Yes ; I see , " Sandy had replied ; and for once he seemed to be considering Erica 's argument seriously , as possibly true and not just an expression of her own opinions . This was rare ; in spite of his chronic shyness and naivete , it was difficult for anyone to make an intellectual impression on Sandy . Perhaps , as a rural small-town boy , he had picked up the automatic agrarian suspicion of all theorizing . Subsequent events seemed to prove that this time , though , he had been convinced . Not only did Erica follow her new rule from that day on  --  Sandy also seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem to know where to stop . Leaving behind the heights of logic and metaphysics , he moved down to the less difficult slopes of ethics and aesthetics ; then , the next year , still lower , to the history of philosophy , with special emphasis on the Oriental tradition . After finishing his degree , he associated himself with less and less reputable institutions , finally ending up with a part-time appointment in a California city college . But no matter how far he descended , Sandy never seemed to reach his level of competence . Probably this was mostly due to self-doubt rather than lack of ability , Erica thinks sadly , watching him now as he spoons sugar clumsily from a cardboard box into a stained cup with no handle  --  why does n't he just pour it ? Sandy had a good mind , and he always worked hard . But even now , on the lowest and muddiest slopes of philosophy ( if it can still be called that ) , even here , in this dingy shop surrounded by half-liter/ate tracts and astrology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really pathetic . For over a year he has been living in this dismal back room on Iona canned peas and Heinz vegetarian baked beans , too shy to presume on their past acquaintance , thinking perhaps that she would n't want to see him now he has sunk so low . Something must be done about this . " You must come to supper sometime soon , " she therefore says , following Zed back into the shop and watching as he sets his improvised tea tray ( a length of unpainted shelving ) on the counter by the door . " I 'd like to . " He unfolds a metal chair for Erica and takes the stool himself . " I have a class tonight , though , and tomorrow I 'm going out to Vinegar Hill  --  the commune . I could come on Sunday , " he adds hopefully , handing a thick crockery cup full of dark reddish tea across the counter to Erica . " Sunday , then . " Though she had in mind a date further off , Erica smiles with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm a vegetarian now , you know . " " That 's all right . I 'll make a cheese souffle or something . " Yes ; and without having to worry any more about how the souffle , or Sandy , will irritate Brian . " And I have n't any car . But do n't worry about that . I 'll get out there somehow . " " Mm , " Erica says , not really listening ; it has occurred to her that there is something she must tell Sandy . " Brian wo n't be there , you know , " she begins , her voice faltering slightly . " He and I . . . " " Yes , I heard about it . " " Oh ? I suppose everybody has , by now . There 's so little to talk about in this town . . . How did you hear about it ? " Zed pauses , looking at Erica over his mug . " Wendy told me . " " Ah . " Erica tries to swallow this information , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She sets the cup down . " You know the whole story , then ? " " Just what she 's told me . " His manner is vague , mild ; butp203Erica is not fooled . She recalls how after quizzes in Greek class , when she asked Sandy how he 'd done , he would reply in the same vague , self-deprecating tone . He knows everything . " I have n't seen her for a while , " he adds . " I may not be up to date . " " Neither have I. " Erica looks at the floor , considering . Brian would be furious that someone like Sandy should know his story ; yet she can not blame Wendy for confiding in him . It was always terribly easy to tell things to Sandy , even things you would n't tell your best friend ; perhaps partly because he was so dim and out of it all . " She admires you very much , you know . " " Yes . " Erica lifts her face , on which a look almost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muddle really . I just tried to sort it out the best I could . " " Wendy said you were incredibly kind to her . She thinks you 're a fantastic , beautiful person . " Zed smiles . " She admires Brian too  --  maybe even more , " he adds in a different tone . " Oh yes , she thinks he 's  --  " Erica begins shrilly ; then stops herself , for she has resolved never to criticize Brian to anyone except Danielle . " I do n't blame Wendy , " she continues more evenly . " Not for anything really . She 's a nice girl . A little naive and weak , that 's all . . . You 're shaking your head . Do n't you agree ? " " I was shaking it at them . " Zed indicates the door of the shop , outside which two young people are standing . As Erica watches they turn away with disappointed expressions . " But I do n't agree , not exactly . After all , weakness can be a strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Or say a modus operandi . I see it here in the store all the time . And I know from my own experience . If you give up the struggle for conventional goals  --  money , status , power  --  a lot of energy is released , for one thing . " He refills the cups , and continues , speaking more slowly , " Also , you have certain tactical advantages . The battle is n't always to the strong , as we learned in History I. The weak have their weapons too . They come and collapse on you ,  |p204like  defeated nations , and you have to take care of them . Oh ! What shall I do now ? ' they cry . So you tell them what . " He grins mockingly . " Then they go and do it , and whatever happens after that is your responsibility . I 've had to make myself a rule : never give advice to anyone . " " Yes , but she was so helpless so desperate really , " Erica says , almost to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " she utters , and stops . " I know that . " Zed looks at her . " I do n't mean it 's calculated , " he continues . " Or even conscious , most of the time . But it works . How do you think Wendy got what she wanted from Brian in the first place ? Essentially it was the same as it was with you . She went into his office and fell apart . Typical double Cancer . " " She fell apart , " Erica repeats , passing over the astrological joke , if it was a joke . She has a vision of Wendy crying and vomiting into her kitchen sink . " It did n't work for a long time . Your husband kept giving her the wrong advice , the kind she did n't want . He told her to find other interests , study harder , try cold showers  --  " " But she did n't take that advice . " Erica frowns ; she feels a little dizzy . " Oh yes she did . She took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had n't worked . That 's how it 's always done . It 's a very old strategy , thousands of years old  --  It 's the standard method for getting into a Zen Buddhist monastery , for instance ; I 've used it myself . " Again Zed glances past Erica to the door . The two young customers have returned , with a third , and are gesturing through the glass ; one holds up a book . " Just a second ; I 'll tell them to come back later . " He stands up . " No , do n't do that , " Erica says , looking at her watch . " Let them in ; I have to leave now anyway to get my children . " She begins to gather her things . " I 'll see you on Sunday . " " Well . All right . " Zed goes to the door , motioning to the people outside with the patting gesture that means " Wait a moment . " " What time shall I come ? " " About seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | " Fine . " " And I 'd better tell you where I am , and how to get there ; it 's a little complicated . If you could give me a piece of paper , I 'll drawa map . " " You do n't need to do that ; I know where you are , " Zed says , turning his sign so that CLOSED faces in again , and unbolting the door . " I 've always known where you were . "  |p206In  the vestibule of the Frick Museum , shortly past noon on the day after Thanksgiving , Brian Tate strolls back and forth , occasionallyglancing at two carved chests and a small bronze sculpture group depicting the triumph of Reason over Error . From time to time he pats the front of his jacket in a quick , concerned way which would inform an experienced pickpocket ( who fortunately is not present ) that a large sum in cash is concealed there . He is dressed more soberly and formally than usual , and his expression is one of confidence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in fact , very like that of General Burgoyne in Reynolds ' portrait , which hangs in one of the rooms he has just passed through . Already today Brian has accomplished much . He has risen early , forced Jeffrey and Matilda to rise , breakfast , pack , and leave his mother 's house in Connecticut ; he has driven to New York , garaged his car , bought Cokes and snacks for the children , put them on the bus for Corinth , and seen it depart  --  completing all these maneuvers in such good time that he was half an hour early at the Frick . His first action there was to make a quick reconnaissanceof the galleries in case Wendy had arrived even earlier . But the museum is unusually empty ; it is an unpleasant day , promisingp207cold rain or sleet , and there are only a few well-dressed old ladies and ill-dressed art students wandering about . Brian has chosen the Frick as a rendezvous for several reasons . First , it is easy to find and convenient to the address he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the few remaining places in Manhattan where it is possible to sit down in pleasant surroundings without buying food or drink . Also it provides the first corner with something agreeable and educational to do while waiting , instead of wasting time . Even more important , it is never crowded . The Met and the Modern are mobbed by humanity during vacation , and among these mobs some of Brian 's students or ex-students are statistically likely to appear . The Guggenheim is quieter , but its design is unsuited to a meeting  --  besides , it always makes him dizzy , as if he had been swallowed by a concrete snail . Beyond its practical advantages , the Frick Museum has an important symbolic function  --  a lesson to teach . More than any public collection can , it stands for a way of life : for elegance , art , taste and civilized living conditions  --  in fact , for all that Wendy has to gain by having finally listened to Reason . In these high , airy rooms is the concentrated essence of everything lacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will show her next summer when they go to Europe . Wendy has never been abroad except for a three-week tour which seems to have consisted mainly of driving through foreign cities during heavy rain in sightseeing buses crammed with American students , all singing popular American songs . She has never met any Europeans except hotel managers and shopkeepers ; never been to Sadler 's Wells or the Prado , or eaten in a good French restaurant . All this , and much more , he can give her , will give her as otherwise he never could have , for as he and Erica proved years ago , it is neither economically or socially possible to tour Europe with a small child . For Brian , the last four weeks have already been an education : not in art history or European civilization , like that he plans for Wendy , but in her own field of social psychology . As his separation from Erica became known to all his acquaintances , and hisp208attachment to Wendy to some of them , he has learned firsthand what is meant by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marital difficulties , he has discovered , are socially equivalent to a childhood or trivial illness  --  colic , chicken pox , flu . Everyone who hears of them is openly concerned ; they express mild regret ( " Sorry to hear about you and Erica " ) mixed with curiosity ( " How is it going ? " ) and a compulsion to relate their own experiences with the same ailment ( " You know Irene once moved out on me ? Yeh , she took the kids and went to her mother 's for three weeks " ) and to offer advice ( " That 's how women are ; you have to give them time to cool off " ) . Adultery , on the other hand , is a social disease . Like halitosis or the clap , it is what only your best friend or worst enemy will mention , though everyone talks about it behind your back . Brian can therefore only guess how widely his affair is known , or how it is generally regarded , though he is aware that both his best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst enemy ( Don Dibble ) think less of him for it . Not all Brian 's lessons in social psychology have been as hard as this . He has found it a great relief not having to face , every day , Erica 's spoken and unspoken reproaches ; and an even greater relief to get away from Jeffrey and Matilda from their noise , their rudeness , their greed . He recalls something Leonard Zimmern said long before his own divorce : that most men do n't want to leave their wives half so much as they do their adolescent children . Now that he has vacated it , Brian realizes he has been living in a hostile camp , among people who at best tolerated , at worst exploited and defied him , for a long while  --  in a sense , all his life . What amazes him most is that this discovery has come so late ; for instance that he could have lived forty-six years without knowing what it is to be really loved . His parents ' affection , though genuine , was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other relatives and his teachers , from nursery to graduate school . The girls he knew before marriage were all self-seeking : even when they claimed to love him , they strove to withhold some part ofp209themselves , either physical or emotional , according to current social custom , in the hope that he would commit himself further to obtain it . As for Erica , Brian has always known that she cared less for him than he did for her . From the start he was the one who loved , while she allowed herself to be loved . That was her nature , he had told himself . It was not as if she preferred someone else ; indeed she very evidently preferred him . Brian could accept that ; did accept it for nearly twenty years  --  until he met Wendy , who never judges him , withholds nothing , cares more for him than for herself . Of course this unconditional love has disadvantages . SometimesBrian feels like a man with a new , overaffectionate pet , whose constant and obvious devotion is half a source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Wendy as often as she , or he , would like -- he has to conserve energy for his work . He has had to teach her to restrain herself in public : not to lick and paw him ; to sit , quietly , and not disturb him when he is working . But overall her effect has been energizing , even exhilarating . He has not perhaps spent as much time on his book as he should , but what time he has spent has been productive . As he paces the hall of the Frick , Brian glances alternately at a guidebook he has purchased , and into the galleries , planning what he will show Wendy , and in what order . The dining room , with its rather simpering portraits of English beauties , can be skipped . The two smaller rooms beyond all light , elegant eighteenth-century French furniture and decorations  --  seem at first glance just right to begin with : a pleasant if frivolous contrast to the gray , dirty city outside . But after a second look he rejects them . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boucher . Indeed , the panels of the inner room , which represent the arts and sciences , are entirely peopled by babies : plump , coy infant poets ; chubby infant astronomers and musicians  --  figures which can not help but recall Wendy 's obsession with the possible genius of her unborn child . Better to start across the way , in the Fragonard Room , wherep210the panels portray an elegant pastoral love affair , and the only children present are winged cupids . It is not the sort of art Brian usually pays any attention to , but today one of the paintings , titled " Reverie , " catches his eye . This shows a very pretty young girl , fair , round-cheeked , sitting dreaming at the base of a tall sundial in a relaxed attitude . He has often seen Wendy sit so , on the floor in his apartment , with her head tilted back and one arm flung out along the couch . Indeed , Wendy could almost have posed for this picture , in the proper fancy dress , with her hair curled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or even this weekend here in the city if she feels well soon enough he must take Wendy shopping . He does n't know much about women 's clothes , but he is aware that hers are not only ridiculous but unbecoming . The heavy leather browns and tans of her American-Indian getup , the dirty yellows and reds of the East Indian prints , are suited to women of a darker complexion . Wendy ought to wear rose , creamy white , lavender , like these French girls whom she resembles ; also her clothes should fit , rather than hang . Something might be done about her hair , too . Looking at the painting again , Brian feels , as the artist clearly intended him to feel , both romantic and sensual . The girl is young but not , to judge by her pose and hints in the other panels , innocent . Her charmingly but almost indecently low-cut dress suggests experience , and so does the way her knees are spread under the long draped skirt , and one hand placed strategically in her lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round tilted top on which a naked cupid marks the hour of noon , is surely phallic . An observer is meant to imagine himself stepping up over the carved and gilded frame into that leafy sunlit garden , lifting those folds of pink and white silk . . . He checks his watch . Wendy is nearly due , so he returns to the museum entrance , but she is not there . This irritates Brian , who dislikes waiting for women at the best of times , and has suggested that she arrive early . Now there will hardly be time for them top211look at anything seriously before their appointment with " Dr. Friendly . " ( Impossible to guess what impulse of self-deception or black comedy had made the abortionist choose this alias . ) Brian walks back through the rooms toward the West Gallery , where the most important works of art hang . It will be a relief when this day is over , he thinks ; when this month is over . Reason has fought a hard battle ; Wendy 's mind , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may look like a graduate student , a liberated woman , but basically she is no different from the girls in the Fragonard Room : feminine , emotional , driven by instinctive forces beyond her own control . Though exasperated and exhausted by the struggle , he knows he can not really blame her  --  that is what women are born for , as the numerous simpering madonnas on these walls testify , from Byzantine icons to Renoir . He recognizes the strength and inevitability of Wendy 's wish to have a child ; but he is determined not to become personally involved in this process . The logical conclusions of his argument have not escaped Brian . Fond as he is of Wendy , he knows that their relationship can not be permanent . Eventually she will need to have children ; she will marry someone nearer her own age . Eventually he will return to Erica and his family  --  probably when Jeffrey and Matilda are somewhat older . But not now ; not yet . He walks down the long gallery inspecting the paintings . Wendy 's attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest can be passed over more rapidly , since they will not have much time now . But as he dismisses them Brian notices one picture which appears to his heightened and impatient perception almost symbolic : Veronese 's " Allegory of Vice and Virtue . " It seems to him that the features of the handsome youth who is rising from his seat beside Vice into the embrace of laurel-crowned Virtue ( but looking back over his shoulder ) might be his own at an earlier age . Virtue , who is somewhat taller than the young man , wears an expression of calm and loving solicitude . Though he has evidently sinned with plump , blond Vice , she intends to take him back ; she wraps her blue mantle around him forgivingly and protectively.  |p212Erica  should see this painting ; there is a lesson there for her . But she would not heed it ; she has not forgiven him yet and may never forgive him now . Most wives would be relieved and grateful for what is about to take place , but he knows Erica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby , but Brian suspects that all along the baby was just an excuse to get rid of him . Otherwise , why should she have been so eagerly self-sacrificing , so willing to dispose of him " for his own good " and the good of another woman 's unborn brat ? Tall , cool , unforgiving , this modern Virtue spurns the hero ; she turns away and wraps her satin cloak around herself . Brian checks his watch again and realizes that Wendy is now almost fifteen minutes late . He walks rapidly back through the rooms . In the front hall he pushes through the turnstile and goes to the door , but Wendy is not coming along the street in either direction . Something has delayed her : her mother ? the bus ? It is annoying , because they are due on Park Avenue at Eighty-seventh in three quarters of an hour . Perhaps he should call , just to be sure . He goes back into the museum , receiving a sour look from the guard at the turnstile , and finds the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she should come in . His dime produces no dial tone , and after losing twenty cents he notices a discreet Out of Order sign in italic penmanship . Swearing , he makes another even more rapid tour of the galleries , and again returns to the front door , squinting through the cold drizzle along Seventieth Street for a phone booth . There seems to be one at the far end of the block and across Madison Avenue ; but if he goes to it he may miss Wendy . And since this is New York , it is also likely to be broken . Feeling more and more irritable , Brian turns back into the building for the third time . As he clicks through the turnstile the guard , a tall cavernous figure in the style of El Greco , addresses him . " You going in or out , mister ? " he asks sarcastically . " This ai n't the subway . " Ignoring the remark as it deserves , Brian continues with an airp213of purpose to a room called in his guidebook the Living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Frick must pass through it to reach the major galleries ; it also commands a view of the courtyard in case Wendy should choose that route . This room is dominated by an imposing fireplace , over which looms El Greco 's " St. Jerome as a Cardinal "  --  the guard at the entrance transfigured . He points sternly to an illuminated page of his Vulgate . The text is indecipherable , but from its location in the volume and his expression , it must be one of the more hysterical prophets . " This place is damned , and all its inhabitants , " he seems to inform Brian . On either side , Holbein 's Thomas More and Thomas Cromwellface each other across the empty marble hearth : the scholar , saint and gentleman 's son from Oxford ; and the son of the Putney brewer , the shrewd , hard politician who in a few years will destroy him . Neither More nor Cromwell are looking at Brian , but as he stands there he feels their attention  --  even , before long , their disapproval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his early heroes , combines sorrow and resolution : it is that of a Harvard professor who finds himself forced to fail a once-promisingstudent . Both as a fond husband and father and as a loyal Catholic , he can not sanction Brian 's recent behavior . His grief at seeing him there on the carpet , with a wad of twenty-dollar bills where his heart should be , is restrained but profound . In a moment he will repeat sadly , almost to himself , the words from his Utopia which he knows Brian once copied onto the flyleaf of a Coop notebook with secret high resolve : For it is not possible for al thinges to be well , onles al men were good . Whych I thinke wil not be yet thies good many yeares . As for Thomas Cromwell , he has little interest in past promises , or in moral questions . This hard-headed administrator , with his heavy ringed hand and his narrow moneylender 's eyes , hasp214no time for such nonsense . He measures value in terms of accomplishment : deals made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At certain moments in his career , for instance at long-winded departmental meetings , Brian has silently called upon this man , who in an incredibly short time and almost single-handed brought the English church under submission to the state . Sometimes the ghost has responded ; has given him the energy to interrupt tedious arguments and propose cutting through petty scruples and red tape . But Cromwell 's attitude toward Brian today is one of cold scorn . He condemns him as a clumsy and impolitic small fool who has allowed mere women to get the better of him ; who has failed to make it either as a good man or a bad one . " You still think that little whore is coming , do you ? " he asks suddenly , hardly moving his tight lips . Disconcerted , and not only that he should imagine a picture to speak , Brian turns his back on the three portraits and looks at his watch . It is twenty minutes to two ; unless Wendy arrives almost at once she will be late for her appointment . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone seriofisly wrong . Wendy has come down with the intestinal flu since he spoke to her yesterday , or she has been mugged by a mugger on her way from Queens to Manhattan . He starts back through the galleries , forcing himself not to hurry , even pausing at moments in front of some painting . The Fragonard girl is still dreaming of her lover below the sundial ; but this time she has a different look . Her abandoned pose , the swelling of her breasts ( now too large to be properly contained by her silk bodice ) , and a fullness in the face which he has lately noticed in We " dy , all suggest the same thing : that she is already , as she would put it , enceinte . And is not the naked cupid above , whose shadow falls toward the number XII , unmistakably demonstrating that it is too late ? Brian pushes past St. Jerome at the turnstile and out onto the damp cold front steps , where for some time he paces back and forth , continually consulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three minutes to two , he makes a rush through the drizzle toward the distant phone , looking back over his shoulder at intervals . Reaching it , he hesitates , wondering how long Dr. Friendly will wait for his thousand dollars ( minus the two hundred he has already received ) - fifteen minutes , surely ? - and decides to call Wendy 's house first . This telephone seems to work , but Brian hesitates ; he stands listening to the dial tone , reluctant to dial , to speak to Wendy 's mother again . He has never met Mrs. Gahaghan , and does not want her to hear his voice too often . Also he feels uncomfortable because when she does hear it she responds as if he were Wendy 's age , rather than only two years younger than she . But the phone is humming , time is passing , and he is cold . He dials the number . " Hello ? " The formal , wary , falsely genteel voice of Mrs. Gahaghan . " Hello , is Wendy there ? " " Gosh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of informal , good-natured regret . " Wendee 's already gone back to college . " " Already gone ? " Brian feigns surprise , for this is what Wendy had planned to tell her parents . " When did she leave ? . . . You see , I was planning to meet her , " he adds . " Oh , dear . You were expecting to meet Wendee today ? " " Yes , about half an hour ago . " Brian tries to project a light , careless tone through the electrical connection . " Oh , dear me . I 'm awful sorry . I guess she must of forgot about it . She left right after breakfast for the university , she got a ride with her roommate Linda , do you know Linda ? " " Yes , I know Linda , " Brian says through his teeth . " She was planning to take the bus , see , but then last night Linda was over and she 'd heard of a ride back to college with some friends , of course that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been feeling very well this vacation and she wanted to get back to her work , she has an examination coming up , I 'm sure you know how that is , and I 'm afraid she did n't think  --  I know she 'll be very sorry when she remembers  --  "  |p216During  this speech Brian holds the telephone farther and farther away from his head , causing Mrs. Gahaghan 's apologetic quacking to dwindle to a distant twitter . When she runs out of breath he brings it back . " Yes . . . Thank you . . . No , that 's quite all right . . . Do n't worry about it , " he says , and hangs up . For the next hour , like Burgoyne at Saratoga , Brian does not allow himself to speculate on what has happened . He concentrates on arranging the practical details of his retreat : telephoning Dr. Friendly , canceling the hotel reservation , returning the two tickets to Little Murders , and getting his car first out of the parking garage and then out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed the George ( Washington Bridge and turned north on the thruway , there is plenty of time to think . There is time to rehearse his conversation with Mrs. Gahaghan ; and also his conversation with Dr. Friendly , in the course of which the doctor reminded him 1 ) that he , Dr. Friendly , is a very busy man who has given up one of his few opportunities to spend time with his own family on a national holiday in order to help Brian out ; 2 ) that he does not do this sort of thing for money , but because he believes in Human Rights ; and 3 ) that he has , nevertheless , extremely heavy expenses . Brian would have liked to make an abrasive remark at this point . Instead he controlled his tongue , and  --  with considerable effort and the promise of an additional fee  --  managed to arrange another appointment for the following week . As well as rehashing the past , Brian has time to think about the future . He curses aloud as he contemplates the student conferences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new hotel reservations that must be made , the twenty-dollar bills that must be withdrawn from the bank ; the renewed negotiationswith Wendy , who will have to be convinced of the reasonable thing again , and driven to New York again . This time he must keep her away from Linda Sliski , and from . Erica and Danielle . He must not let her visit her family ; he must not let her out of his sight for a moment.  |p217Brian  feels an angry exhaustion , a kind of battle fatigue almost a desire to give up the struggle . But he can not afford to give it up . If Wendy remains pregnant she will expect him to marry her . Erica will expect this too , and so will Danielle , and Linda , and presently Mrs. Gahaghan , and all Wendy 's sisters and cousins and aunts . He can imagine how they will all set upon him , using every unfair weapon in the female arsenal : tears and scoldings , injured looks and righteous nagging , sexual blackmail and moralistic whining and threats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , a band of harpies charging toward the New York State Thruway over the nearest icy hill hair flying , claws outstretched  --  followed by dozens more , hundreds , a whole monstrous regiment of women . The men of his acquaintance will not stand with him against this onslaught , though they will censure him if he goes down before it . Brian recalls the earlier imaginary unanimous opinion of his colleagues on the Curriculum Committee that for him to break off his long-standing alliance with Erica Tate and suddenly form one with Wendy Gahaghan would be morally and politically indefensible . In a few cases this opinion will make no difference ; whatever he does , Hank Andrews will remain his friend , and Donald Dibble his enemy . But if he marries Wendy , Hank 's wife ( an elegant shy young woman who quietly admires Erica ) will not invite them to dinner very often . John Randall 's wife ( a well-bred elderly beauty who is a famous local gourmet cook and has always been fond of Erica ) will probably not invite them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps still invite them ; but since Lily is a militant vegetarian , her dinners will consist , as usual , mostly of steamed wheat and raisins and fried eggplant , a type of nourishmenthe already gets too much of from Wendy and her friends . Essentially , all Brian 's colleagues will think less of him if he leaves his wife and children for Wendy  --  including those who might condone a discreet affair . A few may envy him sexually , but not very much , and not for very long . As soon as Wendy 's pregnancy becomes public knowledge even they will look down upon him , and laugh silently , as he would do in their place.  |p218And  if Wendy remains pregnant and he does not marry her , he will also be censured , especially by members of her generation . When his students and graduate students find out ( and some of them will inevitably find out , or at least hear rumors ) they will think him selfish , untrustworthy , uptight and square . In other words , whatever he does , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . By the time Brian is a hundred miles out of New York the repetition of these ideas and recollections has become intolerable to him . It is for this reason that , somewhere near Liberty , he stops for two bedraggled young people holding up a damp-stained cardboard sign reading CORINTH U. As a rule he declines to pick up hitchhikers  --  not as a precaution against robbery , but because he prefers his thoughts to their conversation . In the rear-view mirror , as he slows down , he can see the two students jogging toward him along the dirty shoulder of the road through the rain . They are about the same size and wear'the same anonymous , androgynous jeans and boots and parka , making it difficult to tell of what sex they are , even when they reach the car . " Hey , thanks . " They pile in behind with their knapsacks , breathless . " We thought nobody was ever going to stop . How far you going ? . . . Corinth ? Wow , beautiful . " Brian identifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other by its voice  --  a warm , dominant contralto as female . " You still pissed at me , Sara ? " the mustache asks as Brian swings back onto the highway . " I never was pissed at you , " Sara replies with dignity . " I just think you were being chicken-assed . . . We had this bad experience just now , dig , " she adds , sitting forward behind Brian so that he can see her in the rear view mirror ; she is very young , slim , boyish and intense , with a lot of dark red-brown hair and matching red-brown eyes under heavy straight brows . " We got a ride outside the city with these two greaser-type guys in a truck . They were into a six-pack , and pretty soon they began giving us a hard time because we would n't drink . Especially Stanley . They were pickingp219on his hair and saying how they 'd thought he was a cute chick . " Brian moves his head to get another view of Stanley , who indeed would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soft , nondescript young man . " Then they started saying how they were going to pull off the road and give him a haircut ; and me  --  well , you know the kind of shit . " Sara clears her throat . " So when they had to slow down for the construction back there , we opened the door and jumped out , " Stanley explains . " That was lucky , " Brian says . " Yeh , except then we had to stand in the fucking rain for about an hour , not getting any rides , " Sara complains , " because Stan said no more trucks . He had like suddenly got this stereotype , see . Every time we saw a truck a mile off we had to put our thumbs down . . . I do n't see why you were so unglued , " she says to him . " All you would have lost is hair . I could have got the clap from those guys . " " Yeh , maybe , " Stanley growls faintly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like saved our lives , or at least our relationship . If you had n't come along when you did , I would have stopped anything on wheels . " " You would n't have got into a truck alone , " Stanley states . " The hell I would n't . Well , maybe I would n't now , " she admits crossly . " But after we finish karate I 'm going to go anywhere I fucking feel like . " " You 're learning karate ? " Brian shifts his head so he can address both of them . " I 'm thinking of it , " Stanley says , smiling nervously . " I do n't want her to beat me up . " " I could beat you up now , Stanley , " Sara says . " I could break your arm with the side of my hand , if I wanted to . Lesson Four . " Brian laughs , partly to ease the tension between his passengers . " You think that 's a joke , " Sara says , leaning forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman to want to learn karate . " " I think it 's not absolutely necessary for you to know how top220break a man 's arm . " Brian smiles at Sara in the rear-view mirror , but her expression only becomes more belligerent . The premonitioncomes to him that he is about to hear a speech on the New Feminism . " Though I suppose in certain situations it might come in useful , " he adds , hoping to head the subject off . " If you were living in Manhattan , now  --  " But it is too late . " You think that , because you 're a man , " Sara informs him . " You 're used to the idea that women are the weaker sex , and you want to keep it that way . " " No , I " " You do n't want us to learn karate , it really scares both you and Stan shitless , because for thousands of years you 've kept women down basically by the threat of physical force and violence . " " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're going to say , you 're going to tell me you never hit a woman in your life , but that 's because you never had to , you got your way without it . You do n't have to physically hassle them , all our social institutions do it for you . Like for instance  --  " For the next hour and a half Sara lectures Brian and Stanley on the subject of women : their natural physical , psychological and moral superiority to men ; the manifold injustices they have suffered in the past ; and their right in the present to equal pay , equal educational and vocational opportunities , free day-care centers , and abortion on demand . ( Brian finds this part of the lecture especially annoying ) . At intervals she takes various paperbackand magazines and newspaper cuttings out of her knapsack and reads aloud to them from Simone de Beauvoir and other lady authors . Occasionally Brian tries to change the subject ; or to declare that he is already in favor of equality between the sexes , but Sara will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you do n't really mean it . It 's the same with Stanley . He thinks he wants to get rid of all that chauvinist shit , but he ca n't  --  it 's in too deep , from his conditioning . Like that stupid crack he made about karate . " In the rear-view mirror Stanley 's face twitches , but he does notp221protest . Really , Brian thinks , he is a pretty miserable , low-spirited imitation of a young man . Somebody ought to tell him so , to shame him out of his passivity and knock some guts into him . Brian is beginning to understand why the drunken truckdrivers baited Stanley , and threatened to cut off his long limp curls . If he , Brian , were two big greaser-type guys instead of one small professor , he too might  --  And Sara ? Yes , why not ? A good hard fuck , to shut her mouth for a while . Picturing this scene in his mind , Brian continues to drive as fast as prudent in the direction of Corinth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He does this last so successfully that , having concluded her sermon , she becomes quite affable , even confiding . She and Stanley tell Brian of their difficulties with some members of their commune who are heavily into nudity ( " Okay , so that 's their trip , except then they want the heat up to seventy-five all the time , and the rest of us swelter ; besides , it really kites the gas bill " ) and others who shirk KP . As they approach Corinth , Sara , who is a science major , asks Brian 's advice : is there some course in his department he could recommend to fill her distribution requirement ? ( an impulse of malice comes over him , and he recommends Donald Dibble 's Constitutional Law course , smiling to himself as he imagines the inevitable collision of views . ) Leaving his grateful passengers at the bottom of a muddy farm road , Brian drives on into town , to the apartment building where he has been living for the past month . Alpine Towers ( more literally Tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others are threatened ) is brand-new , blatantly modern . Most of the apartmentsare rented furnished , in the bland indestructible style of airport motels . After four weeks , Brian still often feels that he is in a motel . At other times he feels he is living in one of a rank of post-office boxes which , from the outside , the tall , flat building with its squares of glass and pressed-metal plating closely resembles . Some of the boxes are empty , some crammed full , and they are constantly emptied and refilled ; because of its unusually small rooms and large rents , there is a rapid turnover of incomingp222Corinth faculty and outgoing husbands . It is the only building in town which always has a vacancy . Brian lives alone in the Towers . He has not allowed Wendy to move in with him , though she spends most of her time there . At this stage , he has explained to her , it would not look well . Besides , the apartment is not large enough for two people  --  or even for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Living Area there is only a tiny ill-lit bedchamber . But Alpine Towers is just a few blocks uphill from Wendy 's room in Collegetown , so it is easy for her to go back and forth . As Brian had expected , his apartment on the sixth floor is dark ; Wendy is afraid to face him . Presently he must try to locate her , but not yet ; not tonight . It is nearly nine o'clock ; he has driven for over eight hours today and eaten nothing since breakfast . His body demands a hot shower , a hot dinner and at least eight hours sleep . Throwing his coat on the Danish-anonymous couch , Brian makes himself a strong Scotch and water . He takes one gulp , sighs loudly , and carries the drink with him into his bedroom , switching on the light and tossing his suitcase onto the bed , where it falls heavily against a big heap of blankets which was not there when he left , for Brian always makes up his bed tightly every morning as he was taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Wendy ? " The blankets churn and shift ; she raises her face , which is puffy and streaked with dirty tears . " Well ? " he says in an exhausted , exasperated Navy voice . " I 'm sorry . " Wendy struggles to a sitting position . " I didn'tthink you 'd be back this soon , and Linda 's having a blast . " " I see , " he remarks , in the tone of one who does not see . " I blew it , Brian . " " So I gather . " He comes further into the room , causing Wendy to draw back across the bed with a frightened expression . " I could n't hack it , that 's all , " she mews . " I couldn't. "  | " **26;1243;TOOLONG . " Brian is aware of controlling his anger , ejecting his words slowly like separate cold lumps of metal . " I was scared to . " Wendy smiles rapidly and nervously ; she is up on her knees now , and he can observe that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink peace symbols . " **57;1271;TOOLONG . " He fires another round . " It was n't just that . The whole thing freaked me out . Like you know how I was all last week . And yesterday was worse . I mean you know , Ma and Pa and Brendan and Jakie . And then my sister and her husband drove in from New Jersey with the baby for Thanksgiving dinner , and we had the whole family-of-origin scene . All of them smiling and passing me the gravy and asking how I enjoyed my courses , on account of they did n't know that I was about to commit a murder . Because that 's what they 'd think it was . I realize it 's just my same old parochial-school hangup , the return of the repressed . I know that . Only it really racked me up . " But I was still convinced to do it . Then last night Linda came over , and I was rapping to her about it , and she said , why did n't we consult the I Ching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room ; and the first time I threw the coins I got hexagram number forty-two : Increase . I mean , wow . " She looks up at Brian expectantly , but he makes no response . " The thing is , you know , " she continues , " with the I Ching , lots of times you get an answer that 's really hard to connect to your personal situation : it 's all about the emperor and the great stream . But this was so right on . Increase ! I mean , that 's what I 'm doing , right ? And the Judgement said , get this : The satisfaction of the people in consequence of this increase is without limit . ' You understand ? That means it 's going to work out really fine for everybody . " " I understand , yes , " Brian says , holding his tone steady . " You 're telling me that you decided to change all your plans , andp224screw up your life , and mine , because of the way three pennies fell on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't decide  --  " Wendy 's voice trembles . " No , I do n't think you did . You do n't really believe that kind of superstitious crap . Linda might , her head 's so fucked up , but not you . The truth is you just had n't got the courage , or the integrity , to stand by your decision . " Wendy edges away from the machine-gun fire along the bed , her back against the wall . She has begun to sob intermittently , but Brian has seen too much of her tears over the past month to be impressed . " You had n't even got the decency to let me know . Instead you had to sneak out of town . " Wendy has reached the end of the bed ; she stands up against the far wall , looking damaged . " But if , " she whimpers . " If it 's , you know , God 's will . " " God 's will ! " he repeats grindingly . He feels rage burn up inside him , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the anger he has tamped down over the past twenty-four hours : anger at his mother , his aunts , Jeffrey , Martha , the guard at the Frick , Mrs. Gahaghan , Dr. Friendly , the parking-garage attendant , the clerks at the hotel and theater box office , Sara , and Stanley . He rounds the bed toward Wendy , who is weeping steadily now . " Stop that stupid noise . " He raises his hand ; Wendy , anticipatingthe blow , crumples with it to the floor . Though he has barely touched her , she does not get up or move , but lies there in a heap , sobbing monotonously . The fire blazes on ; Brian prepares to strike again , more effectively , then pauses . It is partly the inhibition of which Sara spoke , a moral and social block against hitting a woman , especially a pregnant woman , a mother . But even more , it is a sense of futility . He sees himself and Wendy again as the sculpture in the Frick : Reason conquering Error . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them was victor , which vanquished . Brian stands upright , fully dressed , his arm raised , his square jaw set , and a righteous frown on his brow ; while Error , half clothed , huddles under his feet , abject and trembling  |p225But  appearances can lie ; art does lie habitually . Brian knows from twenty-five years of teaching that Reason often fights a losing battle , and it is proved again here . All his arguments , his month-long logical analysis of the situation , were not worth three cents to Wendy once his back was turned . She lies there now looking weak and disheveled and defeated ; he can curse her , strike her again , throw her out of his apartment , and she will not resist . But such tactics will not save him . He is joined to Error through his own flesh , as the figures in the Frick are cast of the same bronze . To separate them will take craft , skilled force , patience . " Come on , get up , " he says therefore , nudging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't lie there crying . I 'm not angry at you ; everything 's going to be all right . "  |p226The  one ugly part of the Tates ' pretty old farmhouse is the cellar . It is almost entirely below ground level , dark and usually damp , with mottled walls of a sour gray cement which will not hold paint , and a web of rusty pipes and hot-air ducts and wires hanging from the low ceiling . In the least damp corner , raised off the gritty cement floor on soggy two-by-fours , are the Maytag washer and dryer . Erica is in this cellar on a Monday afternoon in December doing the laundry , which should have been done days ago , when she was in no condition to do it . For a week she has given in to her own bad feelings ; she is almost literally washed out , as if she had climbed into the Maytag and let hot rage and soapy self-pity slosh over her , swishing her back and forth in the dark , draining her finally with a hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limp , wrinkled and wrung out . She still feels wrung out , but the chore can not be put off any longer , for the weather has suddenly turned worse , as everything has turned worse . Erica can not feel the wind down here , but she can hear it beating around the walls with a noise like hostile laughter . The basement air is at once chilly and stuffy , as if it had been left too long in a refrigerator.  |p227It  is . Brian 's fault that she is here , because when he came last Sunday to take the children out to dinner he asked if she could find his old Navy shirts  --  which she later discovered , dirty , in Jeffrey 's closet . " It 's getting pretty fucking cold for this time of year , " he explained in the new youth-culture manner he has recently grown to go with his new sideburns and way of life . She should have screamed at him , Find your own old shirts ! But she was too stunned ; she merely smiled tightly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been behaving for weeks : as if theirs was the most civilized , high-minded , mutually agreeable separation ever seen in Hopkins County . And this although Brian had just given her news that made the separation , and all her plans and efforts and sacrifices , meaningless . Laughable , even . For over a month she had been a romantic and moral heroine ; now , with one stroke , he had turned her into a character in a cheap farce . But for over ten minutes , until Brian and the children drove off , she went on smiling , conversing  --  like those figures in cartoons who go on running in the air after they have passed the edge of the cliff , or had the bridge blown out from under them  --  until the glance down , the double take . Then they crash . As she had crashed after she was left in the empty house with the news that Wendy was not going to have her baby . Brian had announced this calmly ; almost as if he were not concerned . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been trying to arrange it for weeks . She had been naive not to have known that he would do this if he could . Naive and stupid . The wind whuffles against the house , choking with laughter . And of course Brian knew what it would mean to her . That 's why he told her when he was about to leave , when the children were practically within hearing  --  so that she dared not respond . Because he is a coward , afraid to face the consequences of his acts , as Danielle said . Erica does n't blame Wendy ; she knows how Brian must have bullied and argued her into it , probably with some of the same arguments he used here in this house when Erica wanted a thirdp228child : overpopulation , financial responsibilities , his age . She can imagine too how he must have underplayed the risk of an illegal operation at this point  --  the pain , the danger . " But is n't it too late for that ? " she had whispered when he told her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Brian replied smugly , standing there in her dining room in the new dirty-tan Student Shop duffle coat fastened with imitation clothesline and clothespins , which he has bought to go with his new sideburns arid manner and way of life . " Not too late . " And why should n't he look smug ? He has won ; his lies have come true . There will be no inconvenience in his life now , no night feedings or diapers , no use for clothespins except to decorate his coat . There will be no inconvenience to his reputation either : almost no one will ever know that Wendy had been pregnant ; no one but Danielle and Linda Sliski and Sandy will know what Erica had planned to do for her . And if she were to attempt to tell anyone else , to explain how this separation had been different from all others , how she had arranged it herself out of unselfish motives , probably they would n't believe her . They would think she was deluding herself , or trying to delude them , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Erica lets an armful of crumpled wash slump toward the floor , and stands there . For twenty-eight years , ever since she was twelve , she has been running away from Lena Parker and everything she represents . Now she has circumnavigated the globe and run back into her mother 's arms . She too has a husband who has ambiguously left home ; she too can loudly justify herself , and claim more freedom of choice than she really had . At least Lena is n't alive to see it , to add her rationalizations to Erica 's , to say what she would be sure to say about the separation : that it was best for everyone ; that Brian was never " right " for her daughter . " A man married to his work , who does not know how to enjoy , how to laugh ! " as she had once exclaimed . But no doubt Brian is laughing now . He has won : he has destroyed Wendy 's child ; his own child ; her child.  |p229Stoo|ping  wearily , Erica picks up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs to the dining room . She sorts the clothes , folds them , and climbs two more flights to her children 's rooms . Jeffrey 's looks as if it had been recently burgled : the bed is torn apart , drawers are wrenched out and overflowing , books and magazines thrown about . She begins to tidy up , for the third time in a week , then stops . What is the use ? Let him live in filth and chaos , if that is how he chooses to live . She sets her mouth and shuts the door behind her . Matilda 's room , across the landing , is somewhat neater , but equally painful to enter . The bedcovers have been more or less pulled up , the drawers are shut but in the corner behind the door is an ugly heap of debris . It has been there for two days , since Saturday morning when Erica sent the children upstairs to clean their rooms . Jeffrey was back almost at once ( obviously having done as little as possible ) , but Matilda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became aware of distressing sound effects overhead : banging and splintering . Setting the iron on end so fast that it spat water , she ran upstairs , calling her daughter 's name . " Yeh , what ? " Matilda held her door open two inches , scowling through the gap . " What 's going on up here ? I heard dreadful noises . " " I 'm cleaning my room , like you told me to . " " Cleaning your room ? It sounded as if somebody were breaking things . Let me see . " Matilda said nothing , only stood aside so her mother could enter . " Muffy ! What 's happened ? Your weaving loom is all smashed  --  and your planetarium . " " You told me to get rid of all the crap I did n't want to play with any more . You 've been hassling me about it for weeks . " " I did n't say for you to destroy everything . Oh , look at your ballet scrapbooks ! And that beautiful map of Fairyland , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like weeping . " And the dollhouse ,  |p230it  's all smashed sideways . How could you do something like that ? " " I was sick of it , " Matilda cawed . " Ca n't I do what I like with my own stuff ? " " No , you ca n't . " With difficulty , Erica kept her voice under control . " Somebody else might ' have wanted these things , did n't you ever think of that ? We could have given them to Celia Zimmern . " No answer . " Do n't you touch anything else ! Do you hear me ? " " Ookay , " Matilda sighed theatrically her new victim-ofinjusticemanner , which Erica finds almost more infuriating than the old sulks and screams . Not all the remains of Matilda 's destructive fit are still in her room . Erica has carried what was beyond repair out to the trash can , leaving only a few toys which are undamaged or salvageable : some hanks of colored yarn , a few old picture books , and parts of a plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used toset out on the grass in the orchard for dolls ' tea parties , with one of her striped linen dishtowels for a tablecloth , and apple juice tea and animal crackers . And the dollhouse . Once an elegant Colonial mansion , with real turned white wooden bannisters and flowered wallpaper and a pink-and-yellow celluloid fanlight over the door , it looks now as if it had been hit by a hurricane . The roof is unhinged and gaping , the windows spru out of their frames ; furniture and rugs and dishes and doll peo le have been shaken into the corners of the rooms , which are compressed into ugly parallelograms . Gripping the open sides of the house , she tries to straighten it out . But as soon as she lets go , the beaverboard and wood collapse again with a nasty creak . Erica feels her head filling with anger and tears . The selfish destructiveness of her daughter , the loss to Celia  --  and not only Celia , there would have been lots of children , generations of children , who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice toys . Someday , if Wendy 's child had been a girl , and beenp231born , instead of being scraped out of her by some greedy crooked doctor and flushed down a drain in New YorkErica sinks onto Matilda 's braided rug , beside the beautiful Colonial dollhouse which Matilda has turned into a broken home -- as if one were n't enough for her . This whole house is a broken home now , she thinks as if some stupid teenage giantwalking over the world had picked it up and then , losing interest , flung it aside . Like Matilda , she does n't want to play with it any more ; but it is all she has . Her head aches with tears and rage , but she must n't cry again , it will only exhaust her , and besides it is useless . Even if her broken home could be repaired , she would n't want it now . She does n't want her husband back , though the cause for which she sent him away is lost ; because who could possibly want someone like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishonest ? What she wants is her old friend Brian Tate , the honorable , strong , brave , kind , generous young man she married . But that is impossible . There is no such person . Against our will we are dragged through time , by time . Eventually Matilda will become a woman , and be restored to her ; but Jeffrey will grow into a man and join the enemy . Because men are the enemy . The Hens are right about that , if nothing else . Erica has been with Danielle to two general meetings of WHEN , which she found mildly interesting , and to a " rap session " sponsored by them , which she found appalling . She agrees with the Hens in principle , but not in practice politically speaking , shesupports their Declaration of Independence , but not most of their Constitution . She is n't sure , for instance , that she believes in day-care centers . Mothers have a duty to their young children which should n't be made too easy to evade . It also seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , are trying to become like them in all the worst ways  --  taking on their most unpleasant qualities . They are loud , aggressive , competitive : the woman at whose house the rap session was held , for example , talks about female solidarity , but practicesp232the sort of one-upmanship usually seen only in men . If you tell her that Jeffrey wo n't pick up his room , she does n't reply " So aggravating " or " I know , Billy 's just the same , " but " Oh , really ? Billy 's always been verygood about that . Maybe it 's because when he was little I began to teach him . . . " etc . Another unpleasant male characteristic many of the Hens display , and which more than anything else has made Erica determined not to meet with them again , is coarseness of speech . They use the sort of language she abhors in her children , but in an even worse way . It is bad enough to hear Jeffrey speak of his " fucking homework " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse to hear educated women use these adjectives as verbs to describe actual occurrences  --  to listen while they speak in clinical detail of matters which should remain private . But the whole feminist campaign , in Erica 's opinion , is a mistake . The Hens have identified the enemy correctly , but their battle plan is all wrong . They want to scrap the old code of good manners : they do n't like to have doors and coats held for them , or seats offered on crowded trains . They reject these gestures and all that they imply . But in repulsing the traditional attentions of gentlemen , in refusing to be ladies , they are throwing away their best , perhaps their only defense against the natural selfish brutishnessof men . Impulsively and foolishly they are abandoning the elaborate system of fortifications which was built up and maintainedby their mothers and grandmothers over centuries . Today , everywhere , Erica thinks , men must be laughing uproariously as they see us dismantling our own defenses from within  --  removing the elaborate barbed-wire entanglements of etiquette , tearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privacy , and filling in the moat of chastity with mud . In a provincial academic town like Corinth the destruction of the fortress is not yet far advanced , or very visible . For years , secure in a rather old-fashioned marriage , Erica- was hardly aware of it . But it was going on all the same ; now she sees it everywhere . The behavior of men to women living alone , for instance.  |p233Erica  had heard about this from Danielle , but she had misinterpretedit  --  or rather it had been misinterpreted to her . After Leonard left , a year and a half ago , a series of semidetached husbands began to appear at the Zimmerns ' house , offering to replace him temporarily . Erica had reported this phenomenon , rather indignantly , to Brian . But Brian explained that these men came because Danielle had , explicitly or implicitly , invited them  --  because she was , as he put it , " broadcasting . " And Erica believed him , because he too was a man . But she knows that she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , perhaps permanently , and yet these same men , or others like them , have begun to appear at her house , ostensibly to borrow tools or bring their children to visit hers . Others have tried appearing in the university building where she now works and suggesting coffee , or , more crudely , driving her home from dinner parties in the wrong direction and then suddenly stopping the car . But though their means differed , their ends were identical . As she said to Danielle , they only wanted one thing . ( Danielle 's response , as rather often lately , was not satisfactory : " Hell , I do n't know . I used to think , if they only want one thing , the poor bastards , why not give it to them ? " ) What infuriates Erica most about these men is their patronizingattitude . They all seem to believe , and some have openly , jokingly declared , that they are doing her a favor . When she declines this favor they smile knowingly and renew their attack , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starvation , and would be grateful for the opportunity to have intercourse with them . Needless to say , Erica was not grateful . The surprised politenesswith which she had at first received these men 's attentions was quickly replaced by cool disinterest . If they were still not discouragedshe showed moral indignation . This was not well received . When Erica explained that she had resolved never to do to another woman what had been done to her , or reminded her suitors that they were married , some of them laughed and asked when she was going to start living in the modern world ; others sighed and beganp234to complain in a disgusting way of their wives ' sexual inadequacies . One or two even became sneering : they said or implied that if Erica did n't want them she must be frigid , and it was no wonder Brian had left her . Another thing which dismays Erica is that several of her unwanted suitors are the husbands of acquaintances whom she had always believed happily married  --  who no doubt still think themselvesso . She feels a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred to her that it might be right to tell them the truth about their husbands , but so far Danielle has dissuaded her . ( " Believe me , they wo n't thank you . Maybe if it was a real affair they might want to know , some of them . " She smiled cynically . " But not a business like this . Even if they do n't blame you for the whole thing , they 'll dislike you for it , and take your name off their party list . Or else they wo n't believe you . Hell , you remember that time Ruth Taylor came around and said she thought I ought to know that Leonard had tried to feel her up at the English department picnic ? I practically threw her out of the house . " ) Erica is still not sure Danielle is right , though . Her friend is negative about everything lately ; she has become so bitter that it is almost painful to visit her . Roo and Celia are not happy either . It is going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse to invite them to New York , he has also declined to come to Corinth to see them until after New Year 's Day , claiming that he has to work on an important article . ( " Important article , my foot , " Danielle said . " It 's some girl 's ass that 's the important article . " ) Moreover , Danielle has just had a very bad experience , one which might have sent a less tough and experienced woman  --  Erica , for instance  --  into a nervous collapse . This event had occurred last Friday , when she received an unexpected visit from Dr. Bernard Kotelchuk , the veterinarian who had treated Pogo in September . Dr. Kotelchuk had called occasionally since then to see his former patient and the rest of the Zimmern menagerie ; he had become popular with Celia and Roo , who has nicknamed him " St. Bernard . " Erica had met him only once ; he appeared to her as ap235large , doggy , coarse-looking , inarticulate man of about fifty who smelled faintly of disinfectant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without warning at the peculiar hour of 8:45 A.M. , just after Danielle 's children had left for school . He had hardly been in the house ten minutes when , as Danielle put it , " he practically raped me on Roo 's bed with six gerbils watching . " " I fought him off as hard as I could at first , " she told Erica . " It was n't so easy ; he must weigh about two hundred pounds . I was going to knee him in the groin like in that self-defense book , but then it occurred to me that he had probably saved Pogo 's life , and if he wanted sex that badly , why should I make such a fuss about it ? I mean it did n't really matter to me ; it did n't hurt or anything . So I stopped fighting him and lay there , and it was just like nothing was happening . The only thing I thought was , Well , at least I 've still got that loop inside me ; I wo n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's anxious inquiry , Danielle insisted that she was all over the incident ; but Erica does n't believe her . No matter how experienced you are , that is n't the sort of thing you recover from in a few days . And when you are already as badly hurt by men as Danielle has been , it could have lasting psychological effects . For a long while Erica has hoped that Danielle would recover from her bitterness toward the other sex with the help of some kind , sensitive man who would be wise enough to approach her gently and slowly . What happened Friday seems likely to set this recovery back months , perhaps years assuming recovery is possible . Or that there is anyone in Hopkins County worth recovering for . Erica remembers how she used to think that Danielle and the Hens were prejudiced against men . Individually they might have had bad experiences ; but not all men were like the ones they have known , she can remember saying to Danielle . Brian Tate , for example , was not like that ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows , she had been the most deceived , just as now Wendy is the most deceived.  |p236On'e  of the most miserable hours of the past miserable week was the one Erica spent having lunch on campus with Wendy . It had been a long time since they met . For some weeks Erica had kept expecting to run into Wendy , and Brian , at one of the many parties given at this season . She had explained to all her friends that there was no reason not to invite both her and Brian , and she was sure that she would be able to meet him calmly , and behave in a generous forbearing manner when he showed up with his pregnant hippie girl friend . But she was given no opportunity to exercise this forbearance ; and she realizes now how naive it was of her to have imagined that Brian would ever choose to appear in public with a pregnant hippie . It was dreadful just to look at Wendy now ; to see her no longer confident and blooming but sallow , weary , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way she parroted Brian 's arguments , acquiescing in her own defeat . She did n't reproach him for anything  --  only herself , for having caused him inconvenience . " I mean , I 've got years to have kids , " she bleated , pushing aside a half-chewed cream-cheese sandwich . " But if Brian does n't finish his Book now , when it 's published it could be too late to save this country . I could like kill myself when I think how much time he 's already lost because of my stupid behavior . " And Erica could not find it in her heart to tell Wendy that she was like killing herself ; that no book was worth this double human sacrifice . That would only make her more tense and unhappy  --  as tense and unhappy as Erica is herself . Pity and self-pity are catching up with her again as she sits on the floor in her daughter 's room , tempting her to get into the washer again , to give in to despair . She must find something useful to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once taught her : whenever you feel awful , go do something for somebody who feels worse . Psychologically cynical , perhaps but over the years Erica has found it effective . Now , for instance , she could pack up what is left of Matilda 's toys and take them over top237the Zimmerns ' . The dollhouse , too ; even if it ca n't be repaired , at least it will be out of her sight . Erica finds Danielle at home in her kitchen , where she is cutting the meat off the roast chicken they had last night for Sunday dinner , and looking rather better . Her hair has been washed and brushed , and she has on a new red ribbed sweater . " Look at all that , " she says , gesturing with her knife . " I ca n't plan meals right yet ; I still think in terms of a normal family . And I keep forgetting about Roo and her stupid diet . " " I know . " The strain at the Zimmerns ' has been increased recently by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse to eat any roast chicken , she did her utmost to prevent anyone else doing so . ( " Do you know how they kill the poor , poor chickens ? " she asked , staring emotionally at her mother , her sister and Erica in turn . " They grab hold of them and screw their poor heads tight into a sort of big vise , like the one in Industrial Arts , and then tfiey take this big , sharp , bloody ax  --  " But at this point Danielle sent her daughter out of the room . ) " She told me this morning she can only have unfertile eggs for breakfast . Where the hell am I supposed to get unfertile eggs ? " Danielle laughs . " I thought all eggs nowadays were unfertile , " Erica says , trying hard not to think of Wendy 's fertile egg . " So did I. But apparently not , at least not at the Co-op . Here , let 's have some coffee , it 's pretty hot . I ca n't keep up with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Thank you . . . But that 's how it is with everything . You know what I feel sometimes ? " Erica adds , sitting down on a kitchen stool and warming her hands on the mug of coffee . " As if I 'd got into a time machine , like in one of Jeffrey 's science-fiction stories , and been shot forward into the wrong time . Nineteen sixty-nine  --  it does n't sound right , it 's a year I do n't belong in . It does n't even feel real . Reality was when the children were small , and before the housing development . "  | " And before Lennie and Brian left home . Yeh . I know what you mean . " " You see , we know all the rules for that world , " Erica goes on . " Where to shop , what to read and talk about and wear , whom to have for dinner and what to serve , what kind of sandwiches to make for each lunch box , everything . But now we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; P has burned down and you ca n't park on campus any more and everybody 's children have got big and awful . Everything 's changed , and I 'm too tired to learn the new rules . I do n't care about nineteen sixty-nine at all . I do n't care about rock festivals or black power or student revolutionsor going to the moon . I feel like an exhausted time traveler . All these new developments they have , maybe they 're interesting or depressing or amazing , but they have nothing to do with real life . " " Future shock . " Danielle laughs . " I want to go back where we belong , back to when we were first here , and you used to bring Roo and Silly over to play dolls ' tea parties with Muffy . " Erica looks at her friend for the confirmation and humorous sympathy she has learned to expect , but Danielle is busy again with the dismantled chicken . " How are Roo and Silly , I mean Celia , anyhow ? " " Fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the country this afternoon to see his neighbor 's stables . " " Bernie ? " Erica sets her mug down . " Do you mean Bernie Kotelchuk ? " Danielle nods . " I thought you were n't ever going to speak to him again . " " Yeh , I know . But when he came over last night , after you 'd gone Hell , you know , what happened before , it was partly my own fault . " Danielle stops chopping chicken and turns to face Erica , leaning back against her kitchen counter . " I mean , I told him when he got here there was nothing doing , that the other day was a big mistake . He took it very well . He said okay , sure , he understood ; he even apologized . He said he had n't planned to lay a finger on me when he came to the house that morning , but when he saw me with my hair down and barefoot , and only what he calledp239my nightie ' on , he lost control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't dressed properly . I mean , my nightgown 's not transparent or anything  --  it was the red one , you know , that I wear around the house all the time . " " The long sort of Hawaiian mumu , with the big white flowers ? " " That 's the one . Utterly decent . Hell , it was invented by missionaries in Hawaii to cover up everything . But apparently Bernie was brought up in a different tradition , Polish or whatever it was . Respectable women do n't go around barefoot in their nighties . If I did n't want to screw , I should have put on a flannel bathrobe and pink fuzzy slippers before I let him in . . . Well , anyhow he apologized . And he looked at the turtles , and I put Celia to bed , and then Roo went to bed , and we sat around , and I poured us some Scotch you know all those ladies in Brookdale who want to marry Bernie and keep having him to dinner with elaborate food , baked ham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him anything decent to drink . . . Well , there we were . . . So it happened again . " " You mean  --  " " Yeh . " Danielle looks away , then back , smiling with somethingalmost like embarrassment . Erica does not smile . It is bad enough that her best friend should have been raped once by a stupid , coarse , red-faced veterinarian . That she should passively let it happen a second time worries Erica even more . She decides to speak out . " You know , you do n't owe that creep anything just because he looks at sick turtles and once took care of your dog . After all , that was his job . I think you should tell him to stay out of your house . If he has to sleep with somebody , why does n't he go and sleep with one of those women who are always feeding him out in Brook-dale ? " Danielle shrugs . She puts the cut-up chicken away in the fridge and moves onto a stool opposite Erica . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says . " And even then probably not until afterp240the ceremony . He explained it all to me last night . Those people operate on a different system . They 're all good churchgoing widows and spinsters who were ' friends of his dear departed wife . They play by the old rules and do n't commit fornication . " " But that 's not your fault ! You do n't have to let him use you sexually just because nobody else he knows will . " " He does n't use me , really . " Danielle looks down into her coffee and then up again , almost defiantly . " I mean , it was n't so bad this time . In fact "  --  her face reddens  --  " it was sort of fantastic . I was surprised . " " I should think so . " " He was pretty surprised too . But appreciative . He wants to take me out to dinner tonight at the Gables . " Danielle half laughs . " Are you going ? " " Hell , sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't know , " Erica replies , thinking that she would , but trying not to let any note of disapproval into the tune of her voice . She reminds herself that the men with whom Danielle was briefly involved after Leonard left also had faults . Some were opportunistic , others neurotic . But at least they were all presentable , intelligent men : lawyers , artists , professors not Polish veterinarians . " Of course I ca n't really talk to him , " Danielle adds , as if she had heard Erica 's thoughts . " If I mention anything I 'm teaching , he just looks dumb . And politically he 's hopeless : a grass-roots agrarian populist . But hell , I 'm sick of talking to men . Once you start talking to them the next thing is you begin to get emotionally involved , and I 'm not interested in getting involved with any man . I do n't have to worry about that with Bernie , because he does n't want it either . Basically he 's a pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably end up with one of those nice women out in Brookdale . But right now he 's not ready for that ; his wife has only been dead about a year . It 's just a physical thing between us : I need it and he needs it , and that 's all . "  | " Mm , " Erica comments , thinking in spite of herself that Brian last spring had used almost these same phrases to describe his feelings toward Wendy . " And I really do n't like masturbation , " Danielle confides in a lower voice . " I tried it a few times , but I could never get much out of it . I could n't come or anything ; I just always felt nervous and silly , you know ? " " Mm , " repeats Erica , who has had the opposite experience . " Bernie and I talked it over , " Danielle continues . " I told him , no sentimental lies , no commitments , no promises . " She pushes her heavy dark hair back and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Danielle wants her to accept , if not approve , this plan of finding temporary sexual gratification with Bernie Kotelchuk . But how can she ? It is so flat , so grossly practical  --  as if Danielle were to announce : " I want a piece of meat , so I 'm going to the grocery . " Better , surely , to make out with wheat is already in the cupboard , or to become a vegetarian. / But she is anxious not to hurt her friend 's feelings , so she says something vague , and then , inventing a dentist 's appointment , declares that she must leave , in order to prevent herself from saying anything more or worse , having to meet Bernie Kotelchuk . In a flurry of false haste , she scrambles on her coat and boots and scarf and gloves and literally runs from the house . She starts the car fast and , in case Danielle is looking , heads it downtown . It is a heavy , cold , unattractive afternoon ; the clouds hang close over the bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind , still blowing hard , beats and slaps the empty branches about . Erica feels like weeping for Danielle , who has been so beaten about and exploited by men  --  and by her own dependence on them . Gripping the cold wheel with her driving gloves , she promises herself that she will never , never let herself be so exploited . In spite of herself her eyes begin to fill with tears . Never , neverShe stops for a red light , blinking . She is downtown now , but what is she doing there ? There must be something useful , some errands , or Christmas shopping . In the past Erica had alwaysp242finished this task by the first week of December , but this year she is far behind , partly because she ca n't decide what to get for anyone , especially the children . Brian told her yesterday that he is thinking of buying them each an expensive AM/FM radio , something she considers quite unnecessary , indeed an ill-concealed bribe . Not to mention the additional noise these radios will cause in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment . Brian feels guilty toward Jeffrey and Matilda , but not any longer toward Erica . He thinks he has done her a favor by arranging the murder of Wendy 's child , and he proposes to do her another soon by moving back into her house and bedroom . For surely that is what he had in mind last night when he said they must have a serious discussion soon . Like her unwanted suitors , he would be first incredulous and then abusive if she said she did n't want him ; that she does n't want to live in the modern world with a modern man . But she can not sit crying in traffic . Perhaps if she were to park and walk past the stores . . . and there is a space across from the post office . She backs into it , gets out , walks away  --  then returns and feeds a series of pennies into the metallic head of the parking meter . Jeffo and Muffy used to love to do this for her when they were little ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the meters in town belonged to a big family of underground aluminum giraffes , and late at night when nobody was looking they would pull their heads back down through the pavement and play together under the city . But the last time she had referred to this fancy , about a year ago , she had been badly snubbed : " Oh , Mother , must you be so stupid ? " The giraffe smacks its cold metal lips on each coin , pst , pst , pst , and sticks its round metal tongue farther out . Erica walks away from it toward Main Street , looking into shop windows . But instead of useful purchases , everything reminds her of what she wants to forget : a real estate office " Photo Gallery of Desirable Homes " ; in the window of the savings bank , fourth-grade clay artifacts from the school Muffy and Jeffo once attended , wherep243they had made the same loving lopsided bowls and glazed blue animals for her ; the gift-shop display of Great Artists ' Puzzles , featuring a Renaissance nativity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The department-store windows are vindictively symbolic : on one side an imitation ideal family  --  hers of five years ago  --  in matching ski outfits sprinkled with soapflakes ; on the other , four grinning young people in party clothes . The display case flanking the front entrance is full of men 's shoes and boots drawn up in rows at different levels , decorated with argyle socks and plastic holly . They are glossy , heavy-soled , brutally new , ready to stamp and kick and tread on womenShe is not right today , in her head . It is abnormal to feel referred to and mocked and threatened by window displays . That is paranoia , delusions of reference . She must go into the store like a normal person and buy something . But after waiting for fifteen minutes at a counter , elbowed and shoved by other shoppers , only to learn that they are out of Matilda 's size in skating tights except for Baby Pink , Erica has a feeling of exhaustion and revulsion and leaves the store . She walks away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December air and trying to calm herself . Main Street has been elaborately adorned for the holiday season , with garlands of sham grass-green fir and colored bulbs looped from one lamppost to the next , and fat red and silver letters spelling MERRY CHRISTMAS hung across the street . The store windows are also decorated , but in two contrasting styles . As Sandy said last week , two different deities are worshiped in America at this time of year ; and each Corinth merchant has chosen which he will enthrone . Some windows , therefore , feature nativity scenes , softly lit and trimmed with straw , silver-paper icicles , and stars : homage to nature , rural simplicity and maternal love . But most of the shopowners prefer another god . They have erected altars , not to a poor young woman and her baby , but to a rich fat old man . In spite of his evident high spirits , he has certainp244unpleasant characteristics . He is not especially kind to animals , for instance . The family in the bookstore window share their lodgings affectionately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stationer 's next door a life-size cardboard cutout shows the old man wearing a velvet suit trimmed with animal fur . He has large leather boots too , and cracks a long whip over the flanks of his team . He does not favor the working classes , but brings most of his gifts to the rich . He is a pagan God  --  Jove , perhaps whose worshipers have placed his image before their shops to bring not spiritual blessings , but material abundance . At the same time he is also Bacchus : look at the heavy belly , the red drunkard 's complexion ; hear his manic laugh , which is broadcast continually by a speaker over the entrance of the cut-rate drugstore : " aHo Ho Ho ! aHo Ho Ho ! " And he has a good reason for his merriment : he has won now , he has defeated the Virgin and Child , and is on his way to Erica 's house with his sleigh full of unnecessary expensive objects . But does she have to let him in ? Can it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sort of Santa Claus that Brian has proved himself to be ? If she allows it , she is condoning all he has done ; she becomes an accessory after the fact to his crimes . And what about the moral effect on Jeffrey and Matilda ? What about poor Wendy ; how will she feel , having made this sacrifice ? Besides , there is Brian 's work . He needs time alone in order to finish his Great Book , and if he does not get it he will eventually blame her and the children , even if it is not their fault but his own . No , no , Erica thinks , turning and walking back up Main Street , almost the one person empty-handed in the crowd of package-laden Christmas shoppers . Brian must not move back into the house . She must prevent it , for his own sake , and the children 's sake , and Wendy 's . It will be difficult : he will try to persuade her , to reason with her . He will speak of his affection for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation between broken homes and school failure . He will try to make her feel guilty.  |p245But  she must not listen . She must lock her doors against him , even literally if necessary ( it would n't be a bad idea to have the locks changed ) , and if he tries to get down her chimney , she must build up the fire.
