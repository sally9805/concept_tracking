txt Federal judges in six of 12 districts covering the ' Atlantic and Gulf ports , acting after President Nixon had invoked the Taft-Hartley Act , ordered longshoremen yesterday to return to work for a 10-day cooling-off period . The orders did not cover Boston , New Orleans and Houston , where hearings were scheduled for today . The court actions were the first break in the 57-day strike by 45,000 longshoremen . , Affected by the orders are 37,000 workers in six cities ? New York , Philadelphia , Baltimore , Mobile , Ala. , Alexandria , Va. , and Savannah , Ga . Suits are still pending in three other ports . James J. Dickman , president of the New York Shipping Association , said it would take through Monday afternoon to prepare the piers to handle the first of the 69 ships now riding at anchor here . As a result , he said , it will be Monday evening before the longshoremen can be at work . In New York the temporary restraining order was granted by Judge Dudley B. Bonsai after he heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and L. Patrick Gray 3d , assistant attorney general in charge of the civil division . Mr. Lewis and Mr. Gray flew here from Washington with the application papers . The application for a temporary restraining order to be in effect for 10 days was accompanied by a petition for a preliminary injunction to be in effect for the 80-day cooling-off period specified by the TaftHartley Act . In applications for an injunction alleging a grave emergency , it is customary to seek at the outset a restraining order to apply while the suit for an ifijunction is argued ; and considered , so as to restore the pre-emergency status . If the injunction is granted , it will extend the restraint for 70 additional days . Opposing the move was Alfred Giardino , general counsel for the industry , who maintained that they were unable to accede to the insistence by the International Longshoremen 's Association that the em- ployers ? guarantee 40 million man-hours of work a year as the basis for assessments to the welfare , pension and clinic funds . The assessments amount to $30-million ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought to limit their liability- to $10-million . Many employers are in default of their fund payments . The union 's attorney , Louis Waldman , and his son , Seymour , asked that if ' the order were granted the guaranteed annual income existing before the strike began on Oct. 1 be restored , and benefit payments be made retroactive to that ' date . Judge Bonsai directed that conditions existing prior to Oct. 1 be restored but , as is customary , did not rule on the plea for retroactivity . He directed that the Government 's suit for a preliminary injunction be argued Thursday . The Governent lawyers said later , however , that they would ask that they be given until Friday to , prepare the argument . It was anticipated that if the industry were not successful in the hearing on a preliminary injunction , it would appeal to the United States Supreme Court . Judge Bonsai said he was signing the order to avoid what he termed " irreparable injury " to the people of the United States . The Government lawyers presented affidavits by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doing just that . Paul ' W. McCracken , outgoing chairman of the President 's Council of Economic Advisers , said in his affidavit : " The long-term impairment of the U.S. trade position resulting from continuation of the dock strike will weaken the ability of the United States to pursue its national security objectives in the world and to maintain prosperity in the domestic economy . " Accordingly , it is my belief that continuation of the strike , would endanger the national health and safety . " The United States Conunerca , Department reported that The paralysis of the Atlantic and Gulf ports and the closing down of the West Coast ports on July 1 until the granting of a Taft-Hartley injunction there on Oct. 6 was largely responsible for a deficit of more than $821-million in the difference between United States exports and foreign imports in October . It was the largest deficit since the nineteen-thirties . But the lawyer for the shipping industry , Mr. Giardino , held that " the extent ' of the strike is nowhere near that contended by the Government . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly close to agreement " but that the union , which ? walked out on negotiations last Tuesday here and at other times elsewhere , contended that no agreement seemed possible on the guaranteed annual income and other major contract issues , The hearings next week are expected to focus ? on the union 's guaranteed annual income plan , which entitles eligible longshoremen here to 2,800 hours of pay a year at the basic rate of $4.60 an hour whether or not there is work for them . Mr. Dickman , as president of the Council of North Atlantic Shipping Associations , informed the union just before the I.L.A. walkout on Tuesday that the council would insist that financing guarantees be negotiated locally . This would oblige the union to agree to an income guarantee competitive with other ports . Acting Commerce Secretary Tames T. Lynn estimated that the strike had cost the strikers , their families and their local economies nearly $49-million from Oct . I to Nov. 22 .
