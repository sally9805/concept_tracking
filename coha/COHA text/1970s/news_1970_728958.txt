txt It 's " Bike-to-Work " Day . This reporter pedals past one gasping , groaning city bus , then another  --  and leaves both the 7:59 and the 8:04 well behind . It is n't all easy : suddenly the bike 's rear baskets get caught in a crunch between a parked car and another double-parked beside it . We are all part of a new kind of traffic jam until the double-parker moves on . But generally two-wheel commuting ? at least the day I tried it  --  proved cheaper , able alternatives  --  auto , bus , or underground creeping transit . The focus on bike commuting began in New York this September when over 1,000 cyclists pedaled down Fifth Avenue . Chicago , which followed suit on October 3 , now considers its 800,000 bicycle owners a potential political force . Limits of practicality Partly as a result of this show of leg muscle , the Bicycle Institute of America asserts that " by the spring of 1971 , both Chicago and New York will have bike commuter paths and reserved lanes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curtis , Commissioner of Parks and Recreation , Boston will have a viable path through the " Hub " area in six months , too . Washington , D.C. , already has one bicycle path which is frequented by some congressmen , including Rep. Bob Eckhardt ( D ) of Texas , who rides in daily from his Georgetown residence . According to Ralph Hanneman of the Bicycle Institute , San Francisco city leaders are warming up to cyclist demands for a reserved biking area on Market Street , that city 's main artery . And he notes that St. Louis and Omaha , Neb. , also have expressed interest in making the bicycle a feasible alternative to other forms of urban transit . He concedes that bike commuting is not practical everywhere . " We figure that the limit people are willing to travel on a bike is about six miles . So that leaves out cities like Los Angeles that do n't have a central radius . " Reasons for upsurge A number of cities are trying to make bike commuting more convenient . Boston and New York are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as New England Mutual Life Insurance Company , New York 's Consolidated Edison ( " so often maligned as uninterested in anything , " says Mr. Hanneman ) , and ABC and CBS networks have installed racks for their employees . In Boston , Commissioner Curtis , himself a frequent bike commuter , is urging business firms to set up bike " lending libraries " for employees . Why the new surge of interest in bicycle commuting ? ? It 's frequently faster . In a recent test race in Chicago , a cyclist beat a bus by 20 minutes in a commute to the same spot . As one Boston biking enthusiast put it , " Biking is rapid transit . " ? It takes up less space . According to Mrs. Barry Fishman , founder of New York City 's " Bikes for a Better City , " bicycles " open up space for other traffic . " By one estimate , if 10 percent of Manhattan 's automobile commuters switched to bikes , the city 's traffic congestion would be solved . // *Bike power wins : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commuters ( ABC ) in Chicago says that 14 bikes can fit into the parking space of one car . ABC is petitioning to change Illinois law to permit bikes to park in commercial garages . Admission made ? It 's invigorating . " I think the return to the bicycle is a healthy , reasonable return , " says Boston 's Commissioner Curtis . " It 's not like going back from the electric light to the candle . It 's healthy for your mind and attitude . It revives you as you come to work ir . the morning . " He concedes that he usually restricts his bike riding to the last 20 minutes ? " I do n't want to arrive in a sweat , " he says . Whatever the reason for the switch to the " nonpolluting vehicle , " over 64 million Americans now have bikes . Sales of adult bikes rose 20 to 30 percent in 1969 alone , according to the Bicycle Institute . " It 's one continuous rush now , " says Ben Olken , manager of the Bicycle Exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1934 . " It 's getting out of hand ? we just ca n't get enough bikes to meet the demand .
