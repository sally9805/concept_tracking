The word is go . Or , as AEC Chairman James R. Schlesinger put it , " The Atomic Energy Commission is now planning to proceed with the Cannikin test . We have received the requisite authority to go , including detonation . " <P> The decision was made by Richard Nixon himself , and it was a decision he did not expect to have to make . The whole thing seemed simple enough when it was proposed . The nation needed an anti-ballistic missile system , and its prime ingredient was the Spartan warhead , which is designed to destroy or neutralize incoming enemy warheads . <P> Since tests in the atmosphere were banned by international treaty , the new warhead would have to be tested underground . The choice fell on one of the world 's most remote islands-Amchitka , near the end of Alaska 's Aleutian chain-where AEC officials dug a shaft more than a mile deep , and proposed to lower the five-megaton Spartan warhead down to the bottom . All it cost was $200 million , and they anticipated no trouble . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outcry that such a massive explosion , five times as powerful as the previous Amchitka blast in 1969 , might trigger an earthquake or , in case of a blowout , contaminate the area with radioactive fallout . Committees were formed , suits were filed , studies were conducted by Government agencies . Politicians , diplomats and strategists were consulted . <P> But with Nixon 's decision made , AEC Commissioner Schlesinger was firm : " The primary purposes of Cannikin are to proof-test the Spartan warhead . . . before large investment of funds is made on that component of the Safeguard system . Environmental damage has been exhaustively considered , and overriding requirements of national security have , of necessity , taken precedence . " <P> The precedence gained added weight when the Russians set off an underground explosion last spring that U.S. monitors rate at from four to six megatons . " It became evident , " Schlesinger explained , " that the Soviets were ready and eager to test high-yield weapons . " In other words , the Russians were testing ABMs , recognized that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosion would not jeopardize the disarmament talks , which , said Schlesinger , " are proceeding in businesslike fashion . " <P> Fallout in Canada . Reaction elsewhere was less businesslike . Alaska 's Governor William Egan declared that responsibility for any harm done to the Aleutian Islands ( which with Japan and California are situated on the Circum-Pacific Girdle of Fire ) should be borne by the AEC and the President . The Canadian government expressed a " deep sense of disquiet " and , like Egan , held the Administration accountable for any aftereffects that might be caused by the explosion . Taking a more direct approach , a Canadian group chartered a minesweeper , Greenpeace , Too , and sailed from Vancouver for Amchitka , where they intended to anchor outside the three-mile limit in hopes of persuading Washington to cancel the test . Japan , Peru and Sweden have asked that the test be canceled.
