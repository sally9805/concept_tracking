txt Letters Letters TWO WEEKS AT YALE To THE EDITOR : I was shocked that my friend , Dean of the Drama School Robert Brustein , was threatened by an anonymous phone call before May Day . And it was only prudent for him to leave New Haven in the face of this intimidation . It is therefore quite understandable that Dean Brustein 's personal recollections of the two weeks before May Day at Yale ( " When the Panther Came to Yale , " June 21 ) are dominated by images of intimidation followed by injury or capitulation . But the impact of this personal outrage has led Dean Brustein to dramatize the reaction of Yale as a whole in imagery that largely mirrors his own experience . In his portrait , each scene involves a glowering threat followed by terror , injury , or surrender . Indeed , the only sane actor who appears on the stage is Dean Brustein , his lonely voice pleading for restraint , courage and tolerance in a frantic and terrorized world . At a Drama School meeting , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the real beliefs of the Panthers , and who " also felt compelled to say " that a murder had been committed . In the Yale College faculty meeting , the only uncompromised voice we hear was Dean Brustein 's : after " overhearing " a threat , it was he who took " the opportunity to rise on a point of information , reminding the faculty . .. etc . " And so on . All this is excellent theater ? recurrent scenes of intimidating revolutionaries and a terrorized community , punctuated only by a solitary , unheeded voice calling for reason . But it is poor history . For example , approximately a third of his account is devoted to one meeting in Ingalls Rink . He quotes almost verbatim a harangue by Black Panther David Hilliard  --  one of the most threatening , violent and obscene speeches of two weeks that also included much sober reflection and rational discussion . And in his account of the incoherent student who intervened at the rink , he allows the reader to infer that this student 's behavior could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to as his being " beaten " and " stomped . " But , in fact , when Dean Brustein telephoned me to verify his hunch that the // Letters // young man 's bizarre behavior resulted from a " concussion " inflicted by the Panthers , I told him that I saw no evidence whatsoever for this hunch  --  especially since the student 's friends had been worried over his psychological condition for weeks before the episode in the rink . I also told Dean Brustein that the young man was repeatedly offered help through the - University Health Service , which he refused . By leaving this out , Dean Brustein sustains his imagery of intimidation followed by injury and the acceptance of intimidation . Dean Brustein 's account of the Yale College faculty meeting , again through a series of minor errors , ends up with a serious misrepresentation . He initially establishes his mood of faculty intimidation by referring to " the shouts of students milling on the steps , " and by his summary of Kurt Schmoke 's remarks . But the students in fact were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the " desperate need for fast support of the student position . " - He merely said that students were frightened and confused and in need of leadership from the faculty . Furthermore , the resolution introduced by Messrs . Brooks , Long and myself did not urge a " redirection " of the university , but only recommended that faculty members have several " options " ? the most irregular of which was " postponement of academic exercises and requirements for one week . " Dean Brustein does not mention that Prof. Bryce-LaPorte , who introduced the black faculty resolution , made clear that he planned to continue to meet his classes . As for my amendment to set a terminal date for the " modification of normal academic expectations , " Dean Brustein fails to make clear that the amendment was voted upon by the entire faculty and overwhelmingly rejected . Together these minor omissions and errors lead to a major misrepresentation of the faculty 's action . For Dean Brustein indicates that the faculty could " in effect , vote away its academic freedom " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorrect . He was present at the meeting in which the faculty insisted on its " right to teach , " and without a dissenting voice , collectively reaffirmed its commitment to " academic freedom " and noncoercion even in time of crisis . What in fact happened at Yale was precisely the opposite of Dean Brustein 's scenario of intimidation and capitulation . Most faculty members , students and administrators did not leave town . The university was not intimidated into closing its doors . The faculty did not suspend its right to teach . The university did not abandon its insistence upon noncoercion , or its determination to resist violence and intimidation . President Brewster and the administration showed moral courage and leadership ; the faculty acted swiftly yet rationally ; and students behaved with admirable calm , resourcefulness and presence of mind . The psychological reality of Dean Brustein 's own experience during the two weeks preceding May Day is undeniable . But to build a dramatization of the two weeks before May Day around this idiosyncratic experience is to misrepresent  --  indeed to turn on its head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haven . KENNETH KENISTON , Professor of Psychology , Yale University School of Medicine . New Haven , Conn . Dean Brustein replies : " Dr. Keniston 's letter reflects his desire to see the recent events in New Haven as a splendid educational adventure . Well , the educational insights I made were these : When a university is forced into a political posture , its professional functions are inevitably sacrificed , and an extraordinary amount of intellectual energy can be poured into rationalizing away the memory of panic and violence . " Take that Greek student . After Dr. Keniston led the beaten boy off the platform , promising ' to try and help this guy , ' who was in psychological ' trouble , ' I refrained from commenting on the medical questionableness of such instant psychoanalysis , unsolicited and publicly announced . What I wished to know from Dr. Keniston was how he had followed up on his promise , and whether the student 's erratic behavior on the platform could have been caused by a concussion . He did not remember having offered help , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University Health when the student 's friends later called him , and assured me that a concussion was not possible on the basis of what he had later learned . I therefore made no mention of this conjecture , even by implication , in my article . I had no evidence ; by the same token , Dr. Keniston knew nothing of the student 's mental state before he saw him for five minutes on the platform . What is most important here is that this student was hustled off a public platform on the pretext that he was going to receive medical attention. ? an example of what can happen to the practice of psychiatry when it is used for political purposes . " What can happen to the profession of teaching , I have already tried to suggest , and Dr. Keniston 's quibbles do not soften the reality of the events . In the faculty meeting , for example , I myself heard the voices of the students on the steps ; after all , they were making speeches through a bullhorn less than 200 feet from where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a call for ' leadership ' from 1,000 milling students who have already voted to strike ) votes to suspend ' normal academic expectations ' so as to make ' as much time as possible available for the discussion of immediate and pressing issues , ' what else can it be called but a suspension of the right to teach one 's subject ? Otherwise , why issue a directive on an action that individual teachers could elect freely anyway ? " I apologize if I give others the impression that I was a lonely voice of reason at this time ; I plead the pitfalls of personal journalism . But what Dr. Keniston calls my ' idiosyncratic experience ' was shared by sufficient numbers to result in the departure of an estimated 30 to 40 per cent of the Yale population , and an atmosphere of terror that will be forgotten only by those who wish to lacquer over history . I left because of a lack of sympathy with the demonstration and a hatred of mob action , whether from right or left . If Dr. Keniston failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this may be because he still has a little myopia in this regard , having written as recently as last year that ' the avoidance and control of violence . . . is a central goal and key psychological orientation in the New Left .
