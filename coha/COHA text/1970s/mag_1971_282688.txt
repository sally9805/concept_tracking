One of the best-documented medical aftereffects of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was the leukemia that developed in many of the survivors . Those who received the heaviest doses of atomic radiation have been eight times more likely than other Japanese to get the disease . Now a new chapter of research by the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission* reveals what has long been suspected : that those who lived through the A-bombings are more susceptible than others to a whole variety of cancers . <P> An American-Japanese investigatory team studied 20,000 Hiroshima-Nagasaki survivors , all of whom were under ten in 1945 . The findings , reported in the British medical journal Lancet , define a " high-risk group " within the 20,000 as those who were exposed while in the open air one mile or less from the explosion 's center . Cancer has been ten times more frequent in this group than among those who were inside shelters or situated farther from the explosion . Even among people exposed to a lesser degree of radiation , cancers of the thyroid , uterus and bone have developed in increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced over the years in an attempt to explain how radiation triggers cancer . The commission members hope that the cases of cancer in Hiroshima and Nagasaki will yield new clues . <P> Peak to Come . The cancer time bomb will continue to supply grim data . Because many ailing victims procrastinate in seeking medical help , commission physicians and statisticians have had to rely on death records to supply the full cancer census . Though the actual number of cancers detected so far in the high-risk group is only 19 , the team points out that these occurred in a sampling of only 1,109 people , the oldest of whom is now just 35 . Among Japanese of the same age who arrived in Hiroshima or Nagasaki after the bombings , cancer has occurred at less than one-fourth this rate . Even this incidence is unexpectedly high , and the investigators can not yet explain it . <P> The casualty commission sees no evidence that a peak has yet been reached . During the next ten years , the young survivors will be entering the age bracket at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan an even closer watch on their health . <P> <P> - An organization composed of Japanese and American scientists and financed by the two governments .
