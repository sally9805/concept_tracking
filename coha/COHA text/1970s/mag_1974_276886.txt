Every White House staff reflects its President 's style , whims and , most important , use of power . No sooner had Gerald Ford been sworn in than he began to dismantle the tightly hierarchical system erected by Richard Nixon . Ford is designing his presidency like a wheel , with the Oval Office at the hub and spokes radiating out in all directions . The new President intends to be in the middle of the action . <P> The blueprint that Ford is following is a 23-page report that was drawn up by four members of his transition team , all old and trusted friends : former Pennsylvania Governor William Scranton , NATO Ambassador Donald Rumsfeld , Interior Secretary Rogers Morton and White House Counsellor John O. Marsh Jr . The four were careful to sound out the views of the Cabinet and a wide circle of Ford 's advisers and confidants , including Melvin Laird , the former Congressman and Secretary of Defense ; Bryce Harlow , an aide to both Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Nixon ; and Michigan 's Robert Griffin , G.O.P. whip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important reforms , Ford plans to abolish the job of White House chief of staff .

He is likely to be granted his wishes . Ford and his men deeply appreciate the fact that Haig wore himself out performing a thankless task . " If I were Al Haig , " says one top Ford adviser , " I 'd go down to the West Indies and sleep for six months . " <P> With no chief of staff , Ford intends to make himself directly available to half a dozen of his top assistants in the White House , plus such key members of the Cabinet as Secretary of State Henry Kissinger , Defense Secretary James Schlesinger and Secretary of the Treasury William Simon .
