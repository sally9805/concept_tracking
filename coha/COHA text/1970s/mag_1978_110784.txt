Francis Daley Thompson , England 's 20-year-old decathlete , sat back in his stadium seat and considered one unanticipated scourge of holding the British Commonwealth Games in Edmonton , Alberta . " U.S. college recruiters , " he said uneasily , glancing over his shoulder at rows of glittering , covetous eyes . " They all say , ' We have a big football stadium , ' as if that answers all my questions . ' But I do n't play football , ' I say , and they say they know , but if they have football they have everything else I could possibly want . Or if they do n't , they 'll get it . " // Thompson , son of a Nigerian father and an English mother , increased the interest of the flock of vultures when he won the Commonwealth decathlon last week with 8,467 points , 150 shy of Bruce Jenner 's world-record 8,617 . He is now history 's third-best performer . More impressive than the score were his glaring flaws and compensatory brilliances , and the unshielded view he offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw talent . // Perhaps that talent is best measured against Jenner 's record , set in the Montreal Olympics . In the opening 100-meter dash , the thick-legged Thompson sprinted to a personal best of 10.50 . Jenner had done 10.94 at Montreal . In the long jump , a strong 11.2-mph wind helped Thompson reach 26 ' 7 ? " , almost three feet beyond Jenner 's 23 ' 8 ? " . The allowable wind in a decathlon is 8.9 mph , so Thompson 's mark gets an asterisk , as does his 8,467. // Thompson put the shot 47 ' 4 ? " , Jenner 50 ' 4 ? " . Jenner high-jumped 6 ' 8 " . Thompson began shakily , barely scraping over 6 ' 2 " ; then , alternating splendid jumps with clunkers , he climbed to 6 ' 8 " . He cleared that on his second try and missed twice at 6 ' 9 ? " , again looking sluggish . " I tend to forget what it is I 'm doing out there , " he said . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height on his last chance , almost knocking the bar off when he raised his fist in celebration . // In the 400 , the first day 's final event , the wind appeared ready to take back what it had given in the long jump . A few minutes earlier runners in the open 400 had all finished about a second and a half slower than their bests , the result of plowing the first 200 meters into a 20-mph blast . Thompson started carefully , then hunched into the wind , passing the 200 in a modest 23.5 . On the last turn , as the opposition began to tire , he alone held his form and moved away , finishing in 47.85 . Jenner had done 47.51 in Montreal without an adverse wind . After the first day , Thompson 's 4,550 points put him 253 ahead of Jenner 's pace . " I am surprised , " said Thompson , who did n't seem so at all . " But I 'm still a first-day performer , a sprinter-jumper . Give me time and I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart on the second day , simply that his inexperience in events requiring polished technique kept him from a world record . In the high hurdles he hit the first barrier , went off balance and nicked eight of the next nine , finishing in 14.92 . " I was ready for 14.6 , " he said . " I was thinking about winning . I should have been thinking about hurdling . " Jenner had done 14.84 . In the discus , where Jenner had thrown 164 ' 2 " , Thompson managed 136 ' 9 " . // " Horrible , was n't it ? " he said . " It is an event that takes years to develop . " But then Thompson grants himself a long and rich career , saying , " I do n't expect to peak until I 'm 30  --  in 1988. " // In the pole vault Jenner had cleared 15 ' 9 " ; Thompson also did 15 ' 9 " despite an approach run filled with veers and gallops . " It 's like he 's jousting , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of streams running across his practice runway at home and he 's used to jumping them . " It seemed Thompson could make 17 feet if he used a stiffer pole , a faster run ... " and a bit more courage , " as he said . " I had a broken wrist in December , and this is only the third time I 've vaulted this year . " // In the javelin , another event of delicate technique , Jenner had thrown 224 ' 9 " at Montreal . Thompson got a personal best , but it was only 185 ' 8 ? " . That left him needing 4:05.8 in the 1,500 to break Jenner 's record . His previous best was 4:20.2 . On the starting line he all but conceded . " I could n't do it , " he said , " and an all-out effort would only put me close . That would be worse than missing by a lot . " So Thompson ran within himself , with a jolting , pigeon-toed stride , to 4:25.78 . He finished strongly , employing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weary competitors on a victory lap . Against their haggard faces , his was still boyish , still eager . // Later , sitting in the stands before the start of the 5,000 meters , Thompson said , " There 's not much Jenner can beat me in now . Just the discus and the javelin . " // Thompson escaped London 's tough Notting Hill Gate area  --  where he ate very few Wheaties  --  into a private boarding school , Farney Close , and now lives in Sussex , south of London . His cheeky guarantees of greatness are delivered with statistics . He has broken the world junior record each year for the last two and is by far the youngest decathlete ever to attain 8,400 points . // " It 's been great , " Thompson said of Edmonton 's reaction to his performance . " Free lunches , free cab rides . I do n't bother to carry any money anymore . I hope no one breaks the world record in the 5,000. " // Why not ? // " Well , he 'd be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Thompson had to do as the star , though , because there was only one world record set during the 10-day competition  --  Australian swimmer Tracey Wickham 's 8:24.62 in the women 's 800-meter freestyle . Edmonton did have a pair of local stars to cherish , however . Breaststroker Graham Smith , a 20-year-old business major at the University of California , won a record six gold medals ( the 100 and 200 breaststroke , 200 and 400 individual medleys and legs on the 400 freestyle and 400 medley relays ) while swimming in a pool named for his late father , Dr. Don Smith . And Diane Jones Konihowski won four of the pentathlon 's five events and achieved the best score in the world this year , 4,768 points . // Like Thompson , Konihowski appears capable of a world record . She was sixth in the Montreal Olympics , but since the 200-meter dash has been replaced by the 800 in pentathlons , she has no weak event . Konihowski bathed in glory all week , as she was the runner who carried the ceremonial silver-and-gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the Queen  --  and then danced to all hours with Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau . She spoke with the Queen again upon receiving her medal . // " What did she say to you ? " she was asked . // " She really just smiles a lot , " said Konihowski. // The best that Donald Quarrie , the Olympic 200-meter champion from Jamaica , could manage was a half-smile . Trying for his third 100/200 double win in three Commonwealth Games , he found the 100 a rematch against Olympic champion Hasely Crawford of Trinidad and Tobago . They drew the same semifinal . Crawford got out fastest . // " I 'm goin ' get you , " said Crawford at 70 meters. // Quarrie took five hard strides and shot past . " No you 're not , " he said , chiding index finger wagging . In the stands furious betting broke out among Jamaicans and Trinidadians and Tobagonians . One nervous neutral held $1,000 by the time of the final . // Crawford drew the same inside lane he had in Montreal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was n't going to let Montreal happen again , " said Quarrie . " There I passed Borzov and thought I had it , but I did n't see Hasely way over to the left . Here I was n't going to look . Just run . " // Crawford got off best . Quarrie came flying . Crawford thought he had won and held up an arm in conquest . Quarrie thought he had won and took a victory lap . All kinds of money changed hands , then changed back as the results were announced . Quarrie won in a wind-aided 10.03 , while Crawford was timed in 10.09 . Between them , in 10.07 , was a 26-year-old converted long-jumper from Scotland named Allan Wells . Wells uses no starting blocks because they do n't feel comfortable to him , trains his reflexes by punching a speed bag for half an hour a day and displays a refreshing unsprinterlike humility . " To get a silver medal in this field , " he said , " is beyond my wildest dreams . Against Donald Quarrie nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sound Donald Quarrie . In the 200 semifinal , Quarrie leaped into the air with a cramp after 100 meters and did n't qualify for the final . Wells , after burning the turn in something like 10 flat , held off Guyana 's James Gilkes in the stretch to win the gold in 20.12 , also wind aided . // The race that all the distance runners wanted to win was the 5,000 . Brendan Foster , the Games ' 10,000 champion from England , was after it , as was teammate Mike McLeod . Both are from Gateshead ; both are tall , fluid and tough . Foster , for five years England 's best , is a gregarious soul , fond of pack running . McLeod is usually dour and silent , running only with his dog . // The weather conspired against the distance races . The 10,000 was slowed by heat . The steeplechase , made even more exhausting by high winds , was won by the incomparable Henry Rono in 8:26.5 , followed by fellow Kenyans James Munyala and Kiprotich Rono ( no relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of competing and was yearning for the season to end . As a result of his four world records this spring , he has been pursued from pillar to post by frantic meet promoters , shoe representatives and Kenyan officials . During summer races in Europe he picked up a sore knee , a sore hamstring , a sore calf . // " This man is headed for a breakdown , " said a Finnish physiotherapist who has treated Rono . " He 's had too many races . " // But Rono races on . He won the 10,000 and steeplechase in the African Games , two weeks before Edmonton . " I do n't think about records now , " said Rono wearily . " Just about trying to win . " // If anyone seemed capable of denying a vulnerable Rono the 5,000 at Edmonton , it was New Zealand 's Rod Dixon , a faster finisher and now superbly fit . But as thunderheads gathered and huge warm raindrops began to fall on the runners assembling for the start , Dixon experienced an athlete 's nightmare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , credentials and $120 had been stolen . In a non-Olympic moment of flexibility , the start was delayed while a call went out for shoes  --  size 9 ?  --  and a black New Zealand singlet. // At length Dixon was equipped and the race began . Rono led after 800 meters . Foster raced ahead at 1,200 . McLeod stayed a tight third . Dixon , in the pack , felt horrible . " I was shaking in my legs , " he said . " My guts started turning , from the wrench of the thing . And they were useless bloody shoes , jumper 's shoes . " He finished a blistered , tearful eighth . // Rono regained the lead after five laps and ran on unchallenged to win in 13:23.04 . Teammate Mike Musyoki , second in the 10,000 , outkicked Foster for his second silver . Rono was awarded his medal by Kipchoge Keino , his inspiration and fan . // " I felt very bad today , " Rono said , smiling , playful . " Last night there was a party and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get to sleep until 11 o'clock . I 'm glad this is over . " // Foster fixed Rono with a steady gaze . " I can say someone is going to beat him someday , " he said . " But I ca n't say who , and I ca n't say how , and I ca n't say when . " // The way to beat Filbert Bayi of Tanzania is to hang close and pray for rain . Bayi is running well , having escaped malaria attacks this summer . He won his 1,500 heat in 3:38.75 ( his Commonwealth Games and world record is 3:32.2 ) and ran so gracefully that it looked 10 seconds slower . In the final Bayi planned to scorch the first lap in 53 seconds . But on Saturday , it rained , cold and hard . // " I hate rain , " said Bayi . " If I train in it at home , I get chilled and then the malaria comes . " So as planned , he led , but only with silken laps of 57.7 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England 's David Moorcroft and Scotland 's John Robson . Moorcroft got a foot or two lead at the top of the stretch . // " The last 10 meters seemed like 100 , " said Bayi . Still , he held second by one-hundredth of a second from Robson . Moorcroft 's winning time was 3:35.48 ( the equivalent of a 3:53 mile ) . Bayi and Robson were were clocked in 3:35.59 and 3:35.60 , respectively . Scotland 's Frank Clement sprinted up the inside to hit 3:35.66 , making the race the second-fastest of all time . // Later , Bayi said , " I think the 5,000 will be my favorite by 1980 , " adding that he half-regretted not taking a shot at Henry Rono . " He races too much , he trains so hard , so many miles , " said Bayi . A careful , healthy world 1,500-meter record holder , he implied , such as Bayi himself , might be the man to topple the master . // " But I do n't know when , " he said .
