For more than two decades , movie men have huffed and puffed onto the Cte d'Azur once a year to promote their wares at the International Film Festival at Cannes . Then they have gone home , leaving behind vast sums of money , countless Cuban cigar butts and occasional trend-setting films-Marty , One Potato Two Potato , Easy Rider . This year the trend was to revolution . " Right now , " explained Producer Irwin Winkler , " we live in a time when revolution is a very salable commodity . " <P> Serious film makers are usually at odds with moneymen , and this year 's emphasis on youthful rebellion served to deepen the difference . Warner Brothers ' contribution to flackery was several hundred students bused in to organize a demonstration . In the middle of a group of spectators and tough French cops , a small group of students unfurled some innocuous banners and began to croon , " All we are asking is give peace a chance . " Then the protesters launched into a version of " We Shall Overcome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scented trouble . One of them began to advance . The demonstrators gulped and retreated . With much trepidation , a student approached the cop and explained : " Listen , it 's only a promotion for Woodstock . " <P> Sam and Samantha . The films themselves ranged from underground polemics to sleek Hollywood productions . Jean-Luc Godard , in the epicenter of the revolution as always , offered West Wind , written in part by Daniel Cohn-Bendit . The film has its practical side : there are detailed descriptions of how to make gasoline bombs , fuses and timers . From the other side of the Atlantic came M.A.S.H. , Woodstock , and a film still unreleased in the U.S. , The Strawberry Statement . <P> Directed by Stuart Hagmann and written by Israel Horovitz , Strawberry Statement is based on James Kunen 's informal memoirs of the Columbia University rebellion of 1968 . " I want to reach Sam and Samantha in Aurora , Illinois , " Hagmann says . " I want people to say , That 's just like my kids . ' " If Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be because their kids have taken up campus revolution for no more discernible reasons than sex and excitement . Despite endless minutes of sirens , screams , clubs and tear gas at the finale , Strawberry Statement only manages to make the point that Americans can make musical comedy of anything , including youthful dissent . The shallowness of the movie became all the more obvious when newspapers carried photographs of the killings at Kent State the morning after the screening . " It was a nightmare that day , " said Hagmann , " with the reporters coming through saying it was great for sales . " <P> It took the final U.S. entry , M.A.S.H. , to clear away the nasty aftertaste of commercialized commitment . Oddly enough , this was the one protest film based on the uses of bad taste-an insanely funny movie expressing the moral disproportion between war and lesser evils by showing the reality of both . As Director Robert Altman said : " Politics ? I 'm more concerned with behavior , with the insanity of order . This whole syndrome-the new films , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for revolution , yet through these media a bloodless one . "
