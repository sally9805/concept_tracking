FADE IN A white on black TITLE appears in the lower left hand corner of the screen : SEPTEMBER 15 , 1936 FADE OUT  --  3  --  FADE IN 1 EXT . A SLUM AREA OF JOLIET - DAY It 's a bleak , windy morning , the kind that clears the streets of all but the winos ( who carry their own heaters ) , and the point-men for juvenile gangs . We pick up a solitary figure , Joe Mottola , coming down the street and entering what appears to be an abandoned tenement . He pauses a second to dust his white-winged alligator shoes on the back of his pants legs . Sharply dressed and surrounded by the aura of one who is making money for the first time and broadcasting it on all bands , he seems an incongruity in this part of town . We follow him up a flight of rickety stairs to a second floor flat . He knocks on the door , is admitted by a cautious door-man. 2 INT . NUMBERS SPOT - DAY Suddenly we are plunged into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spot for the numbers racket , a place immune from legal interference , where any sucker can bet on a number between 1 and 1000 in the hope of getting the 600 to 1 payoff that goes to those few who guess right . The bettors are queued up in several lines before a long table , where they place their bets and are given receipts in return . Others wait at a cashier 's window to pick up previous earnings or to ask for credit . Mottola moves through the crowd to a back room where betting slips are being sorted and money counted under the watchful and somewhat impatient gaze of a Supervisor , an older man named Mr. Granger . The Yankee-White Sox game is heard on the radio in the background . Mottola , noticing that his entrance has aroused little interest , saunters over to the Phone Girl and gives her a little pinch on the cheek . The girl slaps his hand away , obviously having been through this before . &nbsp; PHONE GIRLBeat it , Mottola . Granger glances up and exchanges a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folding chair next to the radio . The phone rings . &nbsp; PHONE GIRL8720 . . . Yes , hold on a second .

CUT TO  --  4  --  3 INT . A WATERFRONT PROCESSING PLANT - CHICAGO - DAY A flabby , bald man named Combs is on the other end of the line . Visible beyond the door and interior window of his office is a large room , cluttered with tables , typewriters , clerks and adding machines . This room is the clearinghouse for all the transaction of the numbers game . All the betting slips and income from the spots are brought in here and processed . &nbsp; COMBSGranger , this is Combs . Why have n't we heard from ya ? Everybody else is in . &nbsp; GRANGERWe had a few problems with the Law this morning . The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it look good . Nothing serious , it just put us a little behind for the day . &nbsp; COMBSYou been making your payoffs , have n't ya ? &nbsp; GRANGERHell yes . He does this every year . There 's nothing to worry about . &nbsp; COMBSOkay , finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can . I do n't wanta be here all night . &nbsp; GRANGERBelieve me , the Man 's gon na be real happy . Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week . &nbsp; COMBS ( not impressed ) We cleared 22 here . &nbsp; GRANGERWell , hell , you got the whole Chicago south side . How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I 've got to compete with that ?  --  5  --  &nbsp; COMBS ( reading off a sheet of paper on his desk ) They did 14 grand in Evanston , 16.5 in Gary , and 20 in Cicero .

NUMBERS SPOT - DAY Granger storming over to a safe and jerking open the door . &nbsp; GRANGER ( snapping ) Mottola . Mottola hustles out of his chair . &nbsp; GRANGER ( handing him a bundle of bills ) Take this up to the city on the 4:15 . They 'll be waitin ' for it at the clearing house . And do n't stop for no drinks . You can get a cab down the street . Mottola takes the money and slips it into his inside coat pocket with all the dramatic flair of the true flunky . No one would ever guess that he was just an overdressed messenger boy .  --  6  --  Section Details 5 EXT . OF THE TENEMENT AGAIN Mottola emerges from a side entrance into a narrow alley . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a larger alleyway ; this one connecting two streets . The alley is deserted save for one scruffy , slovenly dressed young stranger coming toward him from the opposite direction . The man carries a battered suitcase and seems to be in a hurry . Suddenly , Mottola hears shouting coming from somewhere behind him . He turns around to see a small , weathered looking thief come racing around the corner and down the alley toward him , frantically pursued by a gray-haired black man . Limping noticeably , the black man manages a few cries for help and then stumbles and falls . The stranger yells at Mottola to cover his side of the alley , and then readies himself for the arrival of the thief . Mottola just stands there , not the least interested in the exercise of justice . Just as the thief is about to run on by , the stranger throws his suitcase at the little man 's legs , sending him sprawling and separating him from the wallet he 's been carrying in his left hand . The stranger makes a dash for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing . Almost by reflex , Mottola picks it up . The thief scrambles to his feet and starts back toward his new-found enemy , brandishing a knife . Both the stranger and Mottola brace themselves for an attack . The thief , realizing that there are two people to fight , begins to think better of it . He is not a young man , nor particularly strong . &nbsp; EIRIE ( shaking his fist at the stranger ) You goddam nigger-lover . I 'll get you for this someday , sucker egg . Mottola and the stranger exchange glances of relief as the thief flees out onto the street and disappears . The black man , meanwhile , has struggled to his feet and is staggering toward them . He collapses against the alley wall after a few steps . The stranger rushes over to him , followed somewhat absently by Mottola . &nbsp; COLEMANThe wallet . You got ta go after him . He 's got all the money . &nbsp; STRANGERDo n't worry , we got the wallet . What happened ? He get ya with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man 's coat to reveal a bloody wound at the top of his leg . &nbsp; COLEMAN ( trying to move ) Give it to me ! Please . I got ta know it 's all there ! &nbsp; STRANGERYou just sit tight , old man . We 're gon na have to get you to a doctor . ( starting to leave ) I 'll call a cop . &nbsp; COLEMANNo , no cops ! Mottola has given him his wallet , which the black man now opens , disclosing a fat bundle of bills tied by a rubber band . Mottola and the stranger are amazed by the amount of money . &nbsp; STRANGER ( a little uneasy ) You wanted by the law or somethin ' ? &nbsp; COLEMANNaw , it 's okay . &nbsp; STRANGERYou 're crazy carryin ' that kinda money in this neighborhood . No wonder you got hit . &nbsp; COLEMAN ( trying to get to his feet ) Thanks . I 'm obliged to ya , but I got ta get goin ' .

I 'll fix you up , call you a doc , but I ai n't gon na walk into a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mottola ) How bout you ? I 'll give you the whole hundred ! &nbsp; STRANGERWhat makes you think you can trust him ? He did n't do shit . &nbsp; MOTTOLAHey , butt out , chicken liver . I gave him back his wallet , did n't I ? ( to black man ) How far is this place ? &nbsp; COLEMAN1811 Mason . Put it in Box 3C . You wo n't have no trouble . There 's five thousand dollars there and here 's a hundred for you . &nbsp; MOTTOLA ( taking the bundle of bills from the black man , plus the $100 bill ) All right . I 'll make your drop for you , old man . And do n't worry , you can trust me.  --  9  --  Mottola puts the bills in his inside coat pocket , right next to the numbers money . The stranger , who has now finished bandaging , watches him do it . &nbsp; STRANGERIf those goons out there decide to search ya , you 'll never fool ' em carryin ' it there . &nbsp; COLEMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; STRANGERYou got a bag or somethin ' ? &nbsp; COLEMANNo . &nbsp; STRANGERHow ' bout a handkerchief ? &nbsp; COLEMANHere . The stranger goes into the right coat pocket and pulls out a wrinkled handkerchief . &nbsp; STRANGERLet me have the money . Mottola takes out the Black Man 's five grand and hands it to the stranger . He puts it in the handkerchief . &nbsp; STRANGERYou better stick that other in here too , if you wanta keep it . &nbsp; COLEMAN ( pleading ) Just hurry , will ya . They think I been holding out on them . My wife got sick and I had to pay the bills . I was n't holding out  --  I told them I 'd make it up next delivery . Mottola pulls out the numbers money and puts it in the handkerchief too . The stranger ties it all up . &nbsp; STRANGER ( demonstrating by slipping the bundle down into crotch ) All right . Carry it down in your pants here .  --  10  --  &nbsp; STRANGER ( Cont 'd ) ( pulling it back out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard guy in the world gon na frisk ya there . &nbsp; MOTTOLAThanks. ( to the black man ) So long , partner . Do n't worry , everything 's gon na be allright . The Black Man nods gratefully , but there 's still a trace of worry on his face . Mottola trots off down the alley and out onto the street , glancing around cautiously for signs of trouble . He walks hurriedly down the sidewalk toward the cab stand in the distance . Suddenly the little man with the knife appears out of a doorway about 15 yards behind him . Mottola notices him and quickens his pace , finally breaking into a dead run . We follow him as he dashes headlong down the street , opening a big lead on the guy with the knife . He reaches the taxi zone . He hops in a cab and slams the door . 5-A INT . TAXI - DAY He jumps in , closes the door , and breathes a sigh of relief . &nbsp; CABBIEWhere to ? &nbsp; MOTTOLAWhich way is Mason ? &nbsp; CABBIEAbout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Joliet Station  --  Fast . Mottola settles back in his seat and starts to laugh . &nbsp; CABBIEWhat 's so funny . &nbsp; MOTTOLAI just made the world 's easiest five grand .  --  11  --  He takes the bundle out from inside his pants in order to gaze upon his new-found fortune . He unties the handkerchief . It 's full of toilet paper . Mottola looks like he 's just been shot . 6 EXT . ALLEY - DAY - THE STRANGER AND BLACK MAN hightailing it down the street , two newly solvent con artists on the lam . It 's hard to run they 're laughing so hard . The stranger chucks his suitcase into a trash can , and pulls into an alcove . The older black man is puffing and out of breath . &nbsp; COLEMANHold on Johnny . Oh man , was that beautiful ! Let 's see it  - -  -  The stranger gets out the envelope and starts tearing it open . &nbsp; STRANGERI was sure he was on to us . &nbsp; COLEMANNaw , you had him all the way . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulls the numbers money out of the envelope . They stare at it . &nbsp; STRANGERMy God , Luther , we 're millionaires . &nbsp; LUTHERJesus , what a bundle . Did you know he was that loaded ? &nbsp; STRANGERHell no , I just cut into him . I woulda settled for pawning one of them shoes . They look at each other in delight . Then the black man looks over his shoulder . &nbsp; COLEMANC'mon , we got ta get out of here ! We 'll split it tonight . See ya later . The two men take off , splitting up this time . CUT TO  --  12  --  7 OMITTED Sequence omitted in original script . 8 TITLES SEQUENCE Done to a driving Chicago blues , the sequence is designed to establish somewhat the milieu of the stranger , known to friends and enemies alike as Hooker . We see the following : Section Details 8-A EXT . PAWNSHOP - DAY - LOOKING INSIDE Hooker is getting a radio and a garish suit out of hock . It 's like seeing old friends again . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shabby little place he rents above a cigar store . We pick him up in a jerry-built outdoor shower , which he 's rigged up on the fire escape .

Oh baby , what I would n't do-oo-oo. . . . 10 OMITTED Sequence omitted in original script . 11 ON THE STREET AGAIN - NIGHT jauntily carrying a magnum of champagne and some flowers , obviously on his way to see someone special . 12 IN A BURLESQUE HOUSE Carrying the flowers and champagne , Hooker comes through the stage door and makes his way toward the wings where he brushes by the floor manager . &nbsp; MANAGERHowdy , Hooker , you gettin ' married or somethin ' ? &nbsp; HOOKER ( irritated ) Get used to it , Ed , I 'm gon na look this good from now on . He stands in the wings and watches his date for the evening , a 6 ' 3 ? stripper named Crystal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and comes off the stage . &nbsp; CRYSTAL ( tired ) Hi , Hooker , you gettin ' married or somethin ' ?

( Ed just walks away ) &nbsp; HOOKERYou wan na get outa here tonight ? Come into a little dough . &nbsp; CRYSTALCa n't . I got a 10 o'clock show . I need the five bucks .  --  14  --  &nbsp; HOOKERI 'll spend fifty on ya . Crystal looks at him a second and starts to giggle . We 're pretty sure she 's gon na get outa here tonight . Section Details 13 COMING INTO A POOR MAN 'S GAMBLING JOINT Little more than a converted brick basement , the place contains three shoddy , homemade roulette tables . Hooker , accompanied now by Crystal , nods a greeting to the doorman . Crystal keeps up a steady stream of conversation . &nbsp; CRYSTALYa know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hogan do n't show up anymore , and Corio 's such a lush he ca n't even keep time . You hear what he was playin ' tonight ? ( illustrating with appropriate moves ) I do my kick and turn and he comes in with ka chu boom boom instead of ka chu ka chu boom boom . What if some movie agent was there and I 'm tryin ' to dance to ka chu boom boom , huh ? All those years of trainin ' down the drain . Hooker goes to a table where there are already several other people laying their bets for the next spin . Hooker knows the wheelman , an old-timer named Jimmy . &nbsp; JIMMY ( glad to see him ) Hooker ! &nbsp; HOOKERHow ya doin ' , Jimmy . &nbsp; JIMMY ( collecting bets and paying off the winners ) Ai n't seen you in months , boy . Thought maybe you took a fall . &nbsp; HOOKERNaw , just a little hard times , that 's all .

Lotsa action on 28th Street down there , too . Pay ya 34-1 . As Jimmy finishes his spiel , he starts the wheel spinning and drops in the ball . Betting is allowed to continue until the ball drops from the outer ring into the center . &nbsp; HOOKER ( taking out his wallet ) Three grand on the black . Jimmy is stunned . The others at the table , used to dollar bets , look at Hooker like he 's some kind of foreign dignitary . &nbsp; JIMMY ( worried ) You sure you wan na start off that big ? Bet like that could put a real dent in us . &nbsp; HOOKERI feel lucky tonight . &nbsp; JIMMYAw , come on , Hooker , why do n't you just . . . . &nbsp; HOOKERThree grand on the black , Jimmy . Jimmy wants to argue some more , but the ball is getting ready to drop into the center . We see Jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot . The ball falls and settles into red 27 with a motion that is not quite right . The others at the table fail to notice , but Hooker is not fooled . He stares venomously at Jimmy , who knows that Hooker is on to him . &nbsp; JIMMYSorry , Hooker . ( making an attempt at levity , in order to explain ) Good thing that ball came up red . Guy could get in trouble around here , losin ' a bet that big .  --  16  --  Jimmy reaches for Hooker 's money . Hooker stops him by putting his hand on it . &nbsp; HOOKERSpin it again . Jimmy does n't know what the hell to do . He gives Hooker a little head motion to indicate a large and menacing thug sitting in a corner watching them . Suddenly , Hooker understands why Jimmy had to cheat him , but it does n't change his demand . &nbsp; HOOKERSpin it anyway , Jimmy . Jimmy is beside himself . If he does n't spin again , Hooker may expose him . If he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He pleads to Hooker with his eyes , but it 's no use . Jimmy spins the wheel and reluctantly drops in the ball . This time there is no foot on the lever , and it settles into black 15 . Hooker stares at the ball a second and then looks up at his terrified friend . &nbsp; HOOKERDo n't worry , pal . I knew it was my night . Hooker pushes the money over to Jimmy and walks out of the room , nodding to the thug on the way out . He 's lost $3,000 , but he 's still working on a lucky night . CUT TO 13-A EXT . GAMBLING JOINT - NIGHT Hooker and Crystal out on the street . &nbsp; CRYSTAL ( checking her watch ) Well , looks like I can still make the 10 o'clock .

THE WATERFRONT PROCESSING PLANT - NIGHT A late model Ford roars up and screeches to a stop in front of the plant . Out bursts a carefully-groomed , tight-lipped young man named Greer , who hustles into the plant . We follow him through a maze of machinery to the service elevator and up to the third floor where we find ourselves in the clearinghouse room we saw earlier . 15 INT . PLANT - AFTERNOON - LATE The working day is over now , and everyone has gone , except for Combs , who sits somberly in his office . &nbsp; GREERThey found Mottola . He was drunk in a dive in Joliet .

CUT TO 16 INT . - AN EXCLUSIVE NEW YORK GAMBLING CLUB - LATE AFTERNOON An agitated young man , Floyd , weaves his way through the craps and roulette tables , and hustles up a staircase to a second floor room with a drawing of a snarling tiger on the door . Below the tiger , the word " FARO " appears . There is a large man , of thuggish demeanor , guarding the door , but Floyd gives him a small hand signal and walks right by him . CUT TO  --  18  --  17 INSIDE THE FARO ROOM In the center is a beautifully-carved wooden table , on which sit a faro board and a dealing box , tended by a stone-faced Dealer , who calls the progress of the game in a continuous monotone . On his right is a bookish little man with an abacus-like device that keeps track of the cards which have already been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely absorbed in the rhythmic appearance of the cards from the dealing box , sits Doyle Lonnegan . Although his clothes and accessories are those of a wealthy man , there is a coarseness to both his movement and speech which bespeak lower class origins , for which he now has nothing but contempt . Floyd enters the room and approaches him cautiously , trying hard to make as little noise as possible . &nbsp; FLOYDDoyle , can I see you a minute ? &nbsp; LONNEGAN ( not looking up from the table ) I 'm busy , Floyd . &nbsp; FLOYDIt 's important . We had a little trouble in Chicago today . One of our runners got hit for 12 grand . A new man , Mottola . &nbsp; LONNEGANYou sure he did n't just pocket it ? &nbsp; FLOYDNo , we checked his story with a tipster .

Was n't I knew ya so good , I 'd swear you had class . Hooker laughs and walks into a big hug from an older black woman , Alva .

Hooker goes to the dining room table and plops down some money in front of the other man ( known as the Erie Kid ) who we recognize as the thief who stole Luther 's wallet . &nbsp; HOOKERNice goin ' , Erie .

The girl , a little wobbly herself , has the presence of mind to signal for a cab . One pulls over immediately and she opens the rear door and helps Mottola in . Instead of getting in herself , however , she blows him a little kiss and turns back toward the club . Mottola , not planning on going home empty-handed , reaches out to pull her back when suddenly , out of nowhere , two men wearing gray suits and black fedoras slide in next to him , one on either side . They close their respective doors quickly and signal the cabbie to pull out . Not a word is spoken , but Mottola knows he 's in big trouble for the second time today .

After five years . &nbsp; EIRIEAw come on , it was the only thing to do . He knew he was holdin ' ya back . &nbsp; HOOKERWe were partners .

Hooker makes a break for it , but the second figure , a burly detective named Snyder , tackles him in the middle of the street , drags him back into the alley and plasters him up against a brick wall . The two have met before . &nbsp; HOOKERHi there , Snyder . Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight , eh ? Somebody lose the dominoes ? &nbsp; SNYDERYou scored blood money today , Hooker . You need a friend . &nbsp; HOOKER ( knocking Snyder 's hand away ) Aw , find yourself a shoplifter to roll . Snyder gives Hooker a swift knee in the thigh and follows it with an elbow across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garbage cans . &nbsp; HOOKER ( getting up slowly ) You got the wrong guy , pal . I been home with the flu all day . ( rising to a fuller height ) You can stake out my toilet if you want . Bang . Snyder , infuriated by Hooker 's irreverance , slams him to the ground again . The policeman is no longer holding Eirie but is almost daring him to make a move . Eirie wants to go to Hooker 's aid , but he knows the policeman will beat him to a pulp .  --  26  --  &nbsp; SNYDER ( pulling Hooker out of the heap and smashing him against the wall again ) I 'll tell ya what you did , smart boy . You tied into a loaded mark on 47th . You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th . If he had n't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan , it woulda been perfect . &nbsp; HOOKER ( startled by the information ) You 're crazy . I 'm not stupid enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that do n't make no difference to Lonnegan . He 'll swat you like any fly . &nbsp; HOOKERI 'll square it with the fixer . &nbsp; SNYDERNobody can buy you a prayer , if I put the finger on ya . Snyder lets go . Hooker sinks back against the wall . He says nothing ; he 's waiting for the price . &nbsp; SNYDERI figure your end of the score was at least 3 gees . I want 2 no matter what it was . &nbsp; HOOKER ( lying ) My end was only one . &nbsp; SNYDER ( not taking the fake ) Then you 'll have to come up with another grand somewhere . Hooker is beat and he knows it .  --  27  --  &nbsp; HOOKERAll right . He reaches into his coat , pulls out a stack of bills and counts out $2000 to Snyder . Eirie looks on in amazement ; he did n't think Hooker had it . &nbsp; SNYDER ( pocketing the money and motioning his partner to put his gun away ) You 're a smart egg , Hooker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his policeman friend get in their car and start down the street . Hooker and Eirie walk nonchalantly in the other direction . &nbsp; EIRIEI thought you blew all your money . &nbsp; HOOKERI did . That stuff I gave him was counterfeit . They 'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it . Snyder and his partner disappear around a corner . Hooker suddenly takes off like a shot . 20 INT . DRUGSTORE - NIGHT He runs into a drugstore and goes to the phone booth . There 's already a woman in it . Hooker rips open the door and throws her out . Hurriedly , he begins to dial . &nbsp; EIRIE ( standing outside the booth ) What the hell you gon na do when Snyder rushes his finger right to Lonnegan ? You 're committin ' suicide , kid . &nbsp; HOOKER ( waiting for the ring ) Aw Christ , it does n't make no difference now . If Snyder knows  --  28  --  about it so does everybody else . He never gets anything first . . . Damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EIRIEListen to me , Hooker . Whatever you do , do n't go back to your place tonight , do n't go anyplace you usually go , ya hear me ? Get outa town or somethin ' , but . . . . Hooker , still getting no answer , slams the phone down and blasts out of the booth . 21 EXT . STREET - NIGHT Eirie chases him frantically , calling him to come back , but he 's giving away too many years and there 's no stopping Hooker at this point . CUT TO 22 EXT .

LUTHER 'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT Hooker runs up through a small group of people on the stairs . He bursts into Luther 's room , the door of which is already open . The room shows signs of a struggle , a turned-over chair , a broken lamp , but there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks down into the courtyard and then suddenly sprints back out the door . As we hear him scrambling down the stairs , the camera dollies to the window and looks out . Over this , the sound of the baby crying . 24 EXT . COURTYARD - NIGHT There on the concrete below , face down , is the body of Luther Coleman . Hooker races out to it and kneels down .  --  29  --  &nbsp; HOOKER ( shaking the body ) C'm on Luther , get up . You got ta get up , Luther . In the distance , sirens are heard . Heads are out of the windows and some people are starting to gather in the courtyard . &nbsp; HOOKERGoddamn you , Luther , will you get up ? ( shaking the body ) I 'm not waitin ' for you , Luther . I 'm not waitin ' anymore . Get up , you son-of-a-bitch . Goddamn you , Luther , goddamn . The sirens are close now , and Hooker tears himself away from Luther and runs .

A station security officer , on his morning sweep , wanders by and delivers a terrific blow to the soles of Hooker 's feet with a nightstick . Hooker jolts awake with a cry of pain , as the officer diffidently moves on toward another sleeping victim . Tired and sore from his night in the station , Hooker struggles to his feet and attempts to take stock of the situation . He tries to smooth the wrinkles out of his suit , but it 's futile . A quick check of his wallet finds it as empty as he 'd remembered it . CUT TO 26 THE STATION - GIFT SHOP - DAY Hooker walks in and goes to the toy section . He looks through several small novelties , till he finds what he 's looking for  --  a little tin replica of a policeman 's badge . He looks around for station detectives , and seeing none , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE STATION - WASHROOM - DAY Hooker rinses out his mouth , towels off his face and slicks his hair back with water .

CUT TO 28 STATION - HALLWAY - DAY We see Hooker removing a sign from a door , but the angle prohibits us from reading it . 29 INT . STATION - DAY He drops the sign in a waste can and walks out into the crowded passenger lobby . After scanning the area carefully for a minute , he goes up to a conservative young business man , who 's busy reading the schedule board .  --  32  --  &nbsp; HOOKER ( flashing open his wallet to reveal the little tin badge and then closing it again quickly ) Excuse me , sir . Treasury Dept .. . I 'd like to ask you a few questions . &nbsp; POLK ( flustered ) What for ? I have n't done anything . &nbsp; HOOKERWe do n't doubt that , but there 's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? &nbsp; POLK ( reluctantly ) Yes , a ticket to Chicago . &nbsp; HOOKERThen I 'm afraid we 'll have to impound your money until we 're sure that it 's all good . Can I see your wallet and your ticket , please ? &nbsp; POLK ( handing them over ) But I got a train to make . &nbsp; HOOKER ( taking out the money and returning the wallet ) It 'll only take 20 minutes or so . You can pick it up at the window down the hall . &nbsp; POLKBut what about all these other people ? &nbsp; HOOKER ( blowing up ) We 'll get ' em ! Give us a chance . I 'm not the only agent in here , ya know . We go around advertising ourselves , how many counterfeiters do you think we 'd catch , huh ?

You do n't know how much I appreciate this . &nbsp; HOOKER ( with a little wave ) Think nothin ' of it . The man goes off down the hall , more than grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the " back .

STATION - DAY The Man wandering up and down the hall , wondering how he could have missed that room .  --  34  --  Section Details 32 EXT . CHICAGO STREET - DAY The street runs alongside an elevated train track . We pick ( X ) up Hooker coming down the street , eating a hot dog he bought with the money he just earned in the train station . He appears to be looking for an address , referring every now and then to the piece of paper Luther gave him the night before . Finally he stops in front of an old three-story building which contains a carousel on the bottom two floors and what appear to be apartments on the third floor . He peers inside the big , sliding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around to the side to look for a way in . A 35-year-old woman , Billie , appears in her bathrobe on the ( X ) second floor landing and descends the stairs to get the morning paper . She 's eating an apple . Although she has just gotten up and looks it , she has the presence of one who is probably quite striking at other hours . The sight of Hooker fazes her not at all . &nbsp; HOOKERExcuse me , I 'm looking for a guy named Henry Gondorff . You know him ? &nbsp; BILLIE ( starting back up the stairs ) No . &nbsp; HOOKERLuther Coleman sent me . Billie stops and comes back down the stairs . It 's the first time she 's stopped chewing . &nbsp; BILLIE ( checking him out ) You Hooker ? &nbsp; HOOKERYeh . &nbsp; BILLIEWhy did n't you say so . I thought maybe you was a copper or somethin ' . She goes to a side door and unlocks it . &nbsp; BILLIEIt 's the room in the back . He was n't expecting you so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means , but there 's something about Billie that makes him know that you do n't ask .  --  35  --  33 INT . CAROUSEL - DAY Hooker walks past the now motionless carousel to the room in the back and knocks on the door . No answer . He gives the door a little push and it swings open . 34 INT . GONDORFF 'S ROOM - DAY The room inside is small and cluttered , consisting of a bed , a sink , and a bathroom , all covered by a layer of books , dirty clothes and beer bottles . Draped over a chair , fully dressed , but completely passed out is the one and only Henry Gondorff . &nbsp; HOOKER ( to himself ) The great Henry Gondorff . CUT TO 35 INT . A SHOWER - DAY water blasting out of the fixture . We see Gondorff , still fully clothed , sitting in the bottom of the shower , the spray streaming off his face . An imposing figure , with deep set eyes , he just sits there stoically , looking like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toilet and the sink , watches listlessly . Finally  - -  -  &nbsp; GONDORFFTurn the goddamn thing off , will ya . &nbsp; HOOKERYou sober ? &nbsp; GONDORFFI can talk , ca n't I ? Hooker makes no move to get up . Gondorff struggles to his knees , turns off the water , and slumps back against the wall . The two men just look past each other a second . Down in the bottom . &nbsp; GONDORFFGlad to meet ya , kid . You 're a real horse 's ass . &nbsp; HOOKERYeh , Luther said you could teach me something . I already know how to drink . Gondorff wipes his face with his hand . His mood softens a little .  --  36  --  &nbsp; GONDORFF ( quietly ) I 'm sorry about Luther . He was the best street worker I ever saw . &nbsp; HOOKERHe had you down as a big-timer . What happened ? &nbsp; GONDORFFAw , I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal . A real lop-ear . He thought he was gon na take over General Electric . Some Chantoozie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feds on me . &nbsp; HOOKERYou mean you blew it . &nbsp; GONDORFF ( pause ) Luther did n't tell me you had a big mouth . &nbsp; HOOKERHe did n't tell me you was a fuck-up , either . ( Gondorff looks at him coldly ) You played the Big Con since then . &nbsp; GONDORFFNo , I lammed it around for a while while things cooled off . Philly , Denver , Baltimore , nuthin ' towns . Hooker 's disappointment is obvious . &nbsp; GONDORFFBut do n't kid yourself , friend . I still know how . Hooker nods , unconvinced . &nbsp; GONDORFF ( getting up from the floor and emptying the water out of his pockets ) You gon na stay for breakfast , or do you already know how to eat ?  --  37  --  &nbsp; HOOKER ( tired ) I picked something up on the way . &nbsp; GONDORFF ( sensing something ) Lonnegan after you , too ? &nbsp; HOOKERI do n't know .

They figure maybe he skipped town . You wan na follow ' em up ? Lonnegan regards Floyd patiently and then pats the bench beside him . Floyd sits gingerly .  --  38  --  &nbsp; LONNEGANYou see the guy in the red sweater over there ? We cut to one of Lonnegan 's foursome , a short , squat little Irishman in a red sweater . He has a good-time , friendly manner and a winning Irish smile . We like him immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called him . We used to work subway entrance to the Brooklyn navy yards , sellin ' flowers to the sailors . Danny 'd tell ' em where to find a floosy , and I 'd pedal ' em the flowers . Danny did n't know any floozies , so he usually gave ' em the address of somebody he was mad at . ( chuckles to himself ) Yeh , Floyd , take a good look at that face , ' cause if he ever finds out we can be beat by one lousy grifter , I 'll have to kill him and every other hood who 'd like to take over my operation . You understand what I 'm sayin ' ? &nbsp; FLOYDYes sir . &nbsp; LONNEGANGood lad . Lonnegan is called to the tee by one of his foursome . He exchanges a friendly smile with McCoy and belts the ball down the fairway . CUT TO Section Details 37 INT . THE CAROUSEL AGAIN - DAY Gondorff , dried off now and in a new set of clothes , is pulling up the shades of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light pours in , illuminating fully for the first time the ornate merry-go-round and its massive oaken horses . Hooker watches him go about his business . Billie calls down from the mezzanine which surrounds the carousel . &nbsp; BILLIEYou feeling all right this morning , Henry ? &nbsp; GONDORFFFine , Billie.  --  39  --  &nbsp; BILLIEYou mind opening the round a little early today ? We got some business coming in before hours . Gondorff waves okay . &nbsp; GONDORFF ( to Hooker ) Great little countess , that Billie . Runs a good house up there , too . One of the few left the syndicate does n't own . Gondorff walks around on the carousel , checking straps , bearings and poles . Hooker follows him . &nbsp; HOOKER ( getting impatient ) Gondorff , am I gon na learn some Big Con around here or not ? &nbsp; GONDORFF ( on his back , checking underneath one of the horses ) You did n't act much like you wanted to . &nbsp; HOOKERI wan na play for Lonnegan . &nbsp; GONDORFF ( getting up ) You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he croaked Luther . What else do I got ta know ? &nbsp; GONDORFFPlenty . Does he bet on the fights ? Is he a ladies ' man ? A boozer ? Does he play the market ? Who does his dirty work ? Do you know anything ? &nbsp; HOOKERHe runs the numbers on the South side .  --  40  --  &nbsp; GONDORFFAnd a packing company , a chain of Savings &amp; Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York . There ai n't a fix in the world gon na cool him out if he blows on ya . &nbsp; HOOKERI 'll take him anyway . &nbsp; GONDORFFWhy ? &nbsp; HOOKER'Cause I do n't know enough about killin ' to kill him . It 's the right answer . Gondorff did n't know it himself until now . &nbsp; GONDORFFYou ca n't do it alone , ya know . It takes a mob a guys like you and enough money to make ' em look good . &nbsp; HOOKERSo I know plenty a guys . &nbsp; GONDORFFThis is n't like playin ' winos on the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; HOOKER ( incensed ) I never played for no winos . &nbsp; GONDORFF ( going right on , ignoring Hooker 's remark ) You got ta keep his con , even after you spent his money . And no matter how much you take from him , he 'll get more . &nbsp; HOOKERYou 're scared of ' em , are n't ya ? &nbsp; GONDORFFRight down to my socks , pal . We 're talkin ' about a guy who 'd kill a grifter over a chunk a money that would n't support him two days .  --  41  --  &nbsp; HOOKER ( giving up ) Then you do n't wanta do it . &nbsp; GONDORFFI just do n't want you comin ' back to me halfway through and sayin ' it 's not enough .

CUT TO Music begins and we are into a short : Section Details 38 MONTAGE SEQUENCE detailing the arrival of the other three members of Gondorff 's " mob . " Throughout , Gondorff wears the fedora hat which is his trademark . We begin with  - -  -  A tall , good-looking man , Kid Twist , making his way through the railway station . Impeccably dressed and carrying a small suitcase , he combs the terrain carefully with his eyes . Finally he catches a glimpse of the thing he 's been looking for . It 's Gondorff , standing by a newsstand . Gondorff makes a quick snubbing motion on his nose as if flicking off a gnat . This is known among con men as the " office . " Twist returns the sign with a barely discernible smile as he walks on by . Con men rarely acknowledge each other openly in public , but it 's obvious that these two are glad to see each other . CUT TO 39 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hair cut and his nails manicured . Gondorff gives instructions to the barber . CUT TO  --  42  --  40 INT . HABERDASHERY - DAY Hooker is modeling a new suit in front of a mirror . He does n't look too pleased , but Gondorff peels out a bankroll anyway . CUT TO 41 EXT . HOTEL - DAY a pair of white spats stepping off a bus . We follow them into a : 42 INT . HOTEL LOBBY where we tilt up to reveal J. J. Singleton , the most flamboyant of the bunch . On his way to the check-in desk , he silently exchanges the " office " with Gondorff , who is sitting on a lounge reading the paper . CUT TO 43 INT . APARTMENT - DAY Hooker being shown into a small apartment room by an old woman . It consists of a bed , a table and a sink . Hooker nods his acceptance to the woman and gives her a bill . He takes another look around the room and decides to go out somewhere , but first he wedges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jamb , about an inch off the floor . CUT TO 44 INT . A BIG METROPOLITAN BANK - DAY We hold on a slight , bespectacled teller , Eddie Niles , in the process of counting a large deposit . Niles is all business ; if he 's ever smiled , no one knows about it . He glances up for a second and sees Gondorff " officing " him from across the bank . Without a word he shoves the money he 's been counting back into the hands of a startled customer , abruptly closes up his window , flips his identification tag on the manager 's desk and walks out of the bank . CUT TO 45 INT . AN UPSTAIRS ROOM OF THE CAROUSEL BUILDING - NIGHT This room has obviously been relegated to the status of the storage room . It contains the water heater , mops and brooms , old bed springs , etc . In the middle of the room a space has been cleared for a table , around which are seated Hooker , Gondorff , Niles , Singleton and Twist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat . Kid Twist is in a suit as usual . The room is illuminated by a single bare bulb hanging from the ceiling .  --  43  --  &nbsp; NILES ( referring to notes as he reports ) Lonnegan gets most of his income from the numbers , even though he 's been puttin ' more and more money into his Savings &amp; Loan business . &nbsp; GONDORFFYou think he 's movin ' outa the rackets ? &nbsp; NILESNo . He owns most of the stock , and it 's traded on the board , but my guess is he 's just trying to build himself a respectable image . He came out of the Five Points district , but he 's been telling everybody he was born in Forest Hills . He knows the market though . I do n't think we can take him on a stocks deal . &nbsp; GONDORFFAll right , Twist , what do ya got on the numbers ? &nbsp; TWISTThe tipsters say it 's run out of a packing house on 14th by a guy named Combs . Lonnegan comes out every three weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the day-to-day stuff , in case it 's raided . ( turning to Hooker and producing two photographs ) These are two of Comb 's favorite torpedoes . Riley and Cole . You ever seen ' em ? We recognize Riley and Cole as the two guys who got into Mottola 's car . &nbsp; HOOKER ( studying the photographs ) No . &nbsp; TWISTThey were the guys who hit Luther . They also got the numbers runner you conned . He was found in a quarry with a knife in his eye .  --  44  --  Hooker 's head comes up from the photographs . &nbsp; TWIST ( collecting his papers ) Lonnegan 's had seven or eight people rubbed on his way up . His pattern 's been to get close to a racket boss , learn his operation and then move in on it . He 's done it to Gorman , O'Donnell , Buchalman , and he took the numbers for Sharkey . All four a these guys are dead . He 's vindictive as hell , Henry , and he kills for pride . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from him . &nbsp; GONDORFF ( to Hooker ) You see anything , you let us know , huh ? If they got you on the spot , we 'll fold up the con . You 'd be too easy to find . You got that ? Hooker nods , but we know he has n't really got that . &nbsp; HOOKERYou sure it 'll be one of these two ? &nbsp; TWISTNo . They 're just the only ones we know of . Billie has finished gathering the mugs , and leaves the room with them . We follow her down the hall and into the : 46 RECEIVING ROOM OF HER BROTHEL Carousel music filters up from the arcade below . The room has a bar along one wall and the rest of the space is taken up by tables and couches . It 's a comfortable place , but not opulent . Some of the girls sit patiently on the couches , others play canasta at the tables . Most of the men are at the bar , fortifying themselves for the task at hand . Billie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BILLIE ( to the bartender ) Set me up five more beers , will ya Danny . As Danny goes to fill the mugs , Billie 's eyes fix on a man at the end of the bar .

Not finding what he wants , he comes down the bar to Billie . &nbsp; SNYDERYou the owner here ? &nbsp; BILLIEThat 's right . &nbsp; SNYDER ( flipping out his badge ) Lieutenant Snyder . Bunco . &nbsp; BILLIEJoliet badge , Snyder . Do n't cut much up here . &nbsp; SNYDER ( trying to ignore her remark ) I 'm lookin ' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap .

She knew that when he came in . CUT TO  --  46  --  47 THE STORAGE ROOM AGAIN The discussion continues . Hooker , a bit out of his depth here , listens and stays silent . &nbsp; SINGLETONI do n't know what to do with this guy , Henry . He does n't drink , he does n't smoke , he does n't chase dames , he 's a Commander in the Knights of Columbus , and he only goes out to play Faro . Sometimes plays fifteen or twenty hours at a time . Just him against the house . &nbsp; GONDORFFAny roulette or craps ? &nbsp; SINGLETONWo n't touch ' em . The croupier at Gilman 's says he never plays anything he ca n't win . &nbsp; GONDORFFWhat about sports ? &nbsp; SINGLETONHe likes to be seen with fighters sometimes , but he does n't go to the fights or bet on ' em . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not alone ? &nbsp; SINGLETONJust poker , and he cheats at that .

One hundred dollar minimum , straight poker . Lotta high rollers ride that train just to play him . &nbsp; GONDORFFSounds good , J.J. He 's slowing down already . CUT TO 48 THE RECEIVING ROOM AGAIN Snyder has completed his inspection of the " lobby " and found nothing .

You 'll be bustin ' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall . ( she exits with the drinks ) Snyder is stopped cold . He calls after her . &nbsp; SNYDERKeep your nose clean , lady . He ca n't spend all his time here . CUT TO 49 THE STORAGE ROOM AGAIN Billie comes over to Gondorff and whispers in his ear , while the others talk . His eyes flick momentarily to Hooker . &nbsp; SINGLETONI think we ought to play him on the Rag . It 's the tightest game we got , and it 's not all over the papers yet .  --  48  --  &nbsp; TWISTLonnegan 's a fast egg , J.J. He 's not gon na sit still for a standard play . &nbsp; NILESSo what does that leave us ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gondorff has nodded to Billie and rejoins the conversation .

You think I can get in that poker game , Eddie ? &nbsp; NILESAll you got ta do is show up with some money and look like a fool . &nbsp; GONDORFFI also got ta win . He looks at Hooker .

Never saw him before . He 's a dick , though . Snyder walks all the way to the back , and then retraces his route . About halfway back , he stops at one of the tables , recognizing a grifter he knows . It 's the Eirie Kid . &nbsp; EIRIEHello , Snyder . What are you doin ' up here ? &nbsp; SNYDERI 'm on vacation .

When he is a safe distance down the street , the chatter and drinking resume . CUT TO 58 THE INSIDE ROOM AGAIN Twist gives an all clear signal and returns to the table where he and Boudreau were talking . Boudreau reads from a list of names .

THE TRAIN - NIGHT We pick up Lonnegan coming out of his compartment , flanked by only one bodyguard and Floyd . They start walking single file ( X ) through the passenger section toward the compartment where the poker game will be held . Suddenly a drunken woman comes staggering around the corner and bumps into him . They grapple a moment and Lonnegan pushes her away in disgust . &nbsp; WOMAN ( sloppy drunk ) Keep your mitts off me , ya big lug . If I'da wanted you handlin ' me I woulda asked ya . Lonnegan ignores her and proceeds down the passageway . As the woman proceeds in the other direction between passengers , we see it is Billie . She drops something on a seat beside a passenger . A hand reaches to pick it up . It is Lonnegan 's wallet and it is Hooker who picks it up . Hooker waits a moment , then stands and goes in the direction Lonnegan has taken . He passes by the open door to the card room , hesitating only slightly to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he continues on into the next car . He turns into Gondorff 's compartment . CUT TO 62 INT .

Hooker sits back silently and watches him . &nbsp; HOOKERHe 's waitin ' for you in the card room . &nbsp; GONDORFFLet him wait . As he deals , on the second pass he attempts to cut from the bottom , muffs it completely and sprays half the deck on the table . Hooker regards him steadily as he gathers them back up .

And quite free with it , I might add . Two hundred dollar suit , expensive baggage . I 'll vouch for him . CUT TO 64 GONDORFF 'S CABIN AGAIN " Gondorff is standing in front of the mirror dressing . He grabs up a clean white shirt and rumples it up in his hands . He then picks up a half-full bottle of gin . Hooker gives him a disapproving look . Gondorff smiles and pats some on his face .

Mr. Clemens , give me the cards . The Conductor hands him a sealed deck . As he begins to open it , Gondorff comes into the room , coatless , rumpled , unshaven and looking slightly tipsy . The others at the table , all men of high social or financial standing , are somewhat put off . &nbsp; GONDORFFSorry I 'm late boys . I was takin ' a crap . This bit of grossness does little to improve his image . &nbsp; GONDORFF ( sticking out his hand to no one in particular ) Shaw 's the name . Any ' a you boys wan na make a little book in Chicago , I 'm the guy to see . There are no takers for either the handshake or the book-making offer . &nbsp; CONDUCTOR ( stepping in to save the situation ) Mr. Shaw is a bookmaker from Chicago .

We take several cuts of workmen papering the walls , tacking down carpet , putting in new light fixtures , painting signs , all under the supervision of Niles . From now on , we will refer to the pool hall as the store . Back in the office , Kid Twist is " interviewing " one by one , a group of con men lined up outside the office door . A grayhaired old buzzard , Curly Jackson , approaches the table which is serving Twist as a desk . Curly is practically in rags and has several days growth on his face . He wears a little beret which he takes off to address Twist . &nbsp; CURLYName 's Curly Jackson . I worked for Gad Bryan outa Baltimore . &nbsp; TWISTYou ever played the Wire , Curly ?  --  62  --  &nbsp; CURLYUsed to rope for it long ago . I can shill , mark board , anything you want .

CUT TO 68 THE CARD GAME AGAIN Gondorff and Lonnegan have most of the chips . Lonnegan is slightly ahead . Gondorff has made a token attempt to wear the provided tie , having tied it in a knot around his neck , but not having bothered to put it under his collar . He has a shot glass and the bottle next to him , from which he has been drinking heavily . He and Lonnegan are the only ones left in this hand . &nbsp; LONNEGAN ( throwing chips in ) Raise 500 . &nbsp; GONDORFF ( likewise ) See ya and raise three . &nbsp; LONNEGAN ( more chips ) See and raise five . &nbsp; GONDORFFFive and call .

You 're gon na remember that , or you 're gon na find yourself another game . Gondorff hesitates , then withdraws his hand from the bottle . He knows he 's pushing it . Lonnegan takes the bottle from him and hands it to Floyd , who drops it in a wastecan . CUT TO 69 INT . THE STORE - NIGHT The work is still progressing . We see two workmen installing a ticker tape machine in a secluded area of the store . &nbsp; GARFIELDWe bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg 's wire . He 's got eyes at every track in the country .

We go to Kid Twist , still conducting interviews in the office . A young , rather sullen man , Buck Duff , steps to the table . &nbsp; DUFFBuck Duff . I was in Maxwell 's boost in Troy . &nbsp; TWISTYou the Duff that did n't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up ?  --  64  --  &nbsp; DUFFWas n't no problem a mine . &nbsp; TWISTHe was a con man , was n't he ? &nbsp; DUFFHe was a tear-off rat . He got what he deserved . No sense helpin ' pay his bills . &nbsp; TWIST ( like ice ) Shove off , Duff . Duff stands there a second and then slouches away from the table . He stops however , by the door . The next man up is the Eirie Kid . Twist knows he 's seen him somewhere before . &nbsp; EIRIE ( nervous as hell ) Name 's Joe Eirie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; TWISTYou played for any particular mobs ? &nbsp; EIRIENo . &nbsp; TWISTYou know the Wire at all ? &nbsp; EIRIENo . . . I never played no Big Con before . But Luther Coleman was a friend a mine . I thought maybe there was something I could do . &nbsp; TWIST ( pointing to Eirie 's slightly swollen nose ) You get that nose in Duke Boudreau 's tonight ? Eirie nods a reluctant " yes . " &nbsp; TWISTYou got moxie , Eirie . Get yourself a suit . Eirie is so happy , he can barely blurt out a thank you . Buck Duff , enraged that Twist would hire a total amateur , turns in disgust and strides vengefully out of the store . CUT TO  --  65  --  70 THE CARD GAME AGAIN The room is dense with smoke now , and the players are feeling the heat . Gondorff has his white shirt open , revealing a stained T-shirt underneath .

Lombard over there 'll join ya in a couple minutes . &nbsp; JAMESONNow see here . . . . &nbsp; LOMBARDI 've had enough of this game , and more than enough of the company .

The smile has vanished . &nbsp; LONNEGANStack me a cooler , Floyd . &nbsp; FLOYD ( trying to settle him down ) C'm on , Doyle , we 'll be in the station in a half hour . So you split with him . You still make a nice hunk on the other guys . &nbsp; LONNEGAN ( an order ) Load me a deck . Set it up for threes and nines .

He passes the deck to Lonnegan to cut . Lonnegan takes the deck and in one lightning motion substitutes a new deck , while making it look like he 's cutting the old one . The conductor has finished collecting from Jameson and Lombard , who remain . Gondorff picks up the deck and begins to deal . As the hand is picked up , we see that Gondorff has four threes , Lonnegan four nines , and everybody else has nothing . &nbsp; CLAYTON ( opening the bidding ) Fold . &nbsp; LONNEGAN250 . &nbsp; GONDORFFRaise 1,000 . &nbsp; LONNEGANRaise 500 . Gondorff looks at Lonnegan very carefully for a second . Lonnegan meets his stare . &nbsp; GONDORFF ( slowly ) Raise 2,000 . The spectators shift a little . It 's the biggest bet of the night . &nbsp; LONNEGANSee and raise 1,000 . &nbsp; GONDORFF ( taking it to him ) Raise 5,000 . Lonnegan fingers his remaining chips . He knows he 's won , but he wants to bleed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going for broke ) See , and raise the rest . Lonnegan pushes in the rest of his chips .

Gondorff just stares at them a second , lets out a deep sigh and lays down four jacks . Lonnegan is aghast . This just ca n't be . He glances at Floyd , who can do nothing but sit there with his mouth open . &nbsp; GONDORFF ( raking in the chips ) Well that 's all for me tonight , boys . I 'm gon na leave ya some cab fare . The others players look at each other in disgust . Gondorff starts collecting from the bank . Lonnegan sits in a state of lethal indecision . &nbsp; GONDORFF ( to Lonnegan ) You owe me 15 grand , pal . Lonnegan , with a stare that could kill , finally reaches for his wallet . Suddenly the stare goes soft . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gondorff finishes collecting from the others . &nbsp; LONNEGAN ( getting up to get it ) I guess I left it in my room . &nbsp; GONDORFF ( blowing up ) What ! Do n't give me that crap you little weenie . How do I know you ai n't gon na take a powder . ( waving his wallet , which is full of Lonnegan 's money ) You come to a game like this , you bring your money . Lonnegan , having had all he can take , goes for Gondorff , but is restrained by the conductor . &nbsp; GONDORFFAll right , buddy , I 'm gon na send a boy by your room in five minutes , and you better have that money or it 's gon na be all over Chicago that your name ai n't worth a dime , and you wo n't be able to get in a game of jacks in this town .

Then he looks up at Hooker . &nbsp; HOOKERShaw 's been planning to beat your game for months . He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya .

Two gunmen , Riley and Cole , burst out of his room and fire at him over the railing , but he 's already too far down . Riley and Cole give chase . CUT TO 76 THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING Riley and Cole barrel out of the building and onto the side-walk . There is an empty bus stopped at a light , but they find no sign of Hooker . As the light changes , we cut to the other side of the bus , where we see Hooker crouched on the rear wheel housing , hanging on to a vent . He 's a little shaken , but most of all , he 's still alive . We hold on him , as the bus moves off . &nbsp; GONDORFF ( v.o . ) Everything go all right ? &nbsp; HOOKER ( v.o. ) ( lying ) Yeh , it was easy . CUT TO Section Details 77 INT .

CUT TO 78 OTHER PARTS OF THE STORE We concentrate on some of the fine details , i. e . Garfield explaining how the ticker will read out to Singleton and Billie ; Curly Jackson showing a younger con man how to mark the odds board properly . &nbsp; GONDORFF ( v.o . ) How ' bout Lonnegan ? &nbsp; HOOKER ( v.o . ) I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to . &nbsp; GONDORFF ( v.o . ) And ? &nbsp; HOOKER ( v.o . ) He threatened to kill me . &nbsp; GONDORFF ( v.o . ) Hell , they do n't do that and you know you 're not gettin ' through to ' em . 79 CONTINUING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 's making up the " boodles " or fake bankrolls .

The bundle is then bound with a sealed label , like those used in banks , that says $10,000 . We see that he has already made several of these bundles . HOOKER ( v.o . ) Then he drove me home . He tried to put himself away as legit , so I went right into the pitch .  --  76  --  GONDORFF ( v.o . ) Did he hold you up on anything ? HOOKER ( v.o . ) Naw , he just sat there and listened .

AN OLD DRUGSTORE ACROSS FROM THE ALLEY  --  DAY Probably prosperous at one time , it has since declined , its large fountain and eating area now host to two bums and Hooker , who sits alone in a rear booth near the telephone . Dressed in a tuxedo , he nurses a cup of coffee , and anxiously alternates his glances between the clock and the empty street outside . It 's 12:52 . CUT TO 84 INT . THE STORE  --  DAY The place is full of people , although we avoid long shot so as not to give away the room as a whole yet . Instead , we concentrate on the tense , waiting faces of some of the more familiar people : Gondorff and Niles in tuxedos behind a barred cashier 's area . Gondorff mutilates a piece of gum in his mouth . Niles just stares out into space cracking his knuckles . &nbsp; GONDORFFEddie , cut that out , will ya . The boardmarker walking nervously back and forth in front of his odds board , checking every letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the horses ' names . It was already crossed , but he does it again anyway . Billie and Singleton , in an area hidden from the rest of the room , watching the print-out on the ticker machine . The clicking of the ticker is the only sound we hear in the store . Curly Jackson in front of a mirror , pasting a fake Van Dyke on his chin to go with his tweed suit and monocle . A couple of Billie 's girls adjusting their waitress outfits and primping their hair . Each has a tray full of drinks beside her . The Eirie Kid silently retracing his " route " to make sure he has it down .  --  79  --  Despite the crowd , there is no talking and little movement , save for the constant swirling of smoke from several cigars and cigarettes . The group is like a theatre company waiting to go on opening night . CUT TO 85 THE DRUGSTORE AGAIN It 's 12:56 and Hooker is worried . He looks up to see two large men , obviously racket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seat facing him in the next booth .

Hooker knows they 're Lonnegan 's men , but is somewhat unsettled by the fact that Lonnegan is not with them . Suddenly , a voice . &nbsp; VOICECarver ? Hooker turns around to find that Lonnegan is seated in the booth directly behind him . His bodyguard is in the one behind that . &nbsp; LONNEGANYou should always look to the back too , kid . &nbsp; HOOKER ( sliding out of his booth and into Lonnegan 's ) I was afraid you were n't gon na come . We have n't got much time . &nbsp; LONNEGAN ( curtly ) Get on with it then . &nbsp; HOOKER ( pointing to telephone ) Sometime after 1:00 a guy 's gon na call here and give you the name of a horse .

Be careful with that though , it 's all I got . &nbsp; LONNEGANAnd you were gon na pay me back ? &nbsp; HOOKERI am after this race . Lonnegan says nothing .

Kid Twist looks at it a second and then picks up the phone and begins to dial . 89 INT . DRUGSTORE Lonnegan again . He 's getting impatient now and lights a cigarette , and then the phone rings . He answers it quickly and we hear : &nbsp; TWISTBluenote at 6 to 1 on the nose . The receiver clicks down at the other end .

Overnight it has been transformed into a swank private club , with bar , cigarette girls , upholstered furniture and chandeliers . &nbsp; SINGLETONLook at that . He 's got four apes with him . &nbsp; GONDORFFThat'w what I like about these guys , J.J .. . They always got protection against things we 'd never do to ' em . Everywhere there is activity . A bank of telephones buzzes incessantly . Sheet writers scurry from phone to phone , taking bets of tremendous size from prominent people .  --  82  --  &nbsp; SHEET WRITERYes , Mr. Ruth , 20,000 on Dancing Cloud . We reveal that the phones are controlled by a master switch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a partition . The boardmarker , wearing headphones suspended from a sliding wire , hurriedly chalks up races and odds on a huge blackboard . From the loudspeakers we hear the words " Last flash " . The odds on Bluenote settle down to 8 to 1 . Lonnegan makes his way through the throng toward the betting line . His bodyguards fan out to various positions in the room . The betting crowd itself ( known as the " boost " ) consists of close to twenty people , none of whom , of course are what they 're pretending to be . Large amounts of money are changing hands at the betting window . Boodles are in sight everywhere . Lonnegan slips into the betting line , feeling somewhat estranged from the general merriment around him . There are two men in line ahead of him . The first , Curly Jackson , slaps down several bundles of cash in front of Niles , who 's the cashier , and places a $20,000 bet on War Eagle . Gondorff appears at the cashier 's window and catches sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd think you 'd get tired of losin ' , Honnigan . &nbsp; LONNEGAN ( piercingly ) The name is Lonnegan . &nbsp; GONDORFF ( to Niles ) Make sure you see cash from this guy , Eddie .

Bluenote 's race is now up on the board . The race caller comes on the loudspeaker . &nbsp; CALLERLadies and Gentlemen . This is Arnold Rowe , your caller for the second race at Belmont in New York .

Gondorff and Niles watch it from the cashier 's cage . &nbsp; GONDORFF ( worried ) That 's not where we want him to sit . Eirie tries to ignore Lonnegan at first , but realizes he better make some conversation . &nbsp; EIRIEC'mon War Eagle . ( to Lonnegan ) That Dancing Cloud 's a hell of a finisher . War Eagle 's gon na have to open up a little more on ' em . &nbsp; LONNEGANYou know anything about a horse named Bluenote ? &nbsp; EIRIENaw , he 's never done much .

Hooker comes over to clear some empty glasses from his table . &nbsp; LONNEGAN ( out of the corner of his mouth ) You really picked a winner , kid . &nbsp; HOOKERGive ' em a little time . &nbsp; CALLERInto the backstretch it 's War Eagle still by a length , Dancing Cloud closing on the inside , is second by two , Lucky Lady is third by one and a half , followed by Bluenote , Jail Bate , Wits ' End and Mojo .

Who in blazes is Bluenote ? &nbsp; LONNEGAN ( to Eirie , very self-satisfied ) War Eagle 's where you want to have your money , huh ? Eirie does n't reply . He ca n't believe Bluenote won . Lonnegan looks to Hooker . Hooker gives him a wink . For the first time , Lonnegan permits a smile . CUT TO 91-A LONNEGAN AT THE CASHIER 'S WINDOW Niles is counting out $16,000 to him ( all of which Gondorff won the night before ) . Gondorff looks somewhat perturbed .

Gondorff gives Hooker a hard shove in the back with his foot , sending him into a table and sprawling to the floor . &nbsp; GONDORFF ( indicating Lonnegan 's bodyguards ) And tell him not to bring his garbage men in here no more . This is a class joint . Hooker , pretending to be humiliated , gets to his feet and escorts Lonnegan to the door . Lonnegan stops , gives Gondorff a derisive smile , and walks out . Once he 's gone , the general clatter and hubbub in the room cease , like it had been turned off by a faucet . Most of the boost sit down and relax . Curly Jackson rips off his Van Dyke .

Lonnegan , wearing a silk bathrobe , is seated at a table counting a pile of money . There are two other assistants behind him . They do n't look friendly . &nbsp; HOOKERWell , what did I tell ya ? &nbsp; LONNEGANYou got lucky once . That 's not enough . &nbsp; HOOKERLucky , hell .

LONNEGAN 'S HOTEL - DAY We pick up Hooker coming out of the hotel and going off down the street . As he does so , we pull back all the way across the street and through the interior of a parked car to reveal the silhouette of a man seated at the wheel . We move to his right hand , which rests on the steering column . It 's covered by a black glove and the middle finger is missing . His trigger finger , however , taps lightly on the wheel .

He turns to leave the booth , when suddenly he sees something that stops him cold . There looking through the glass is the smirking face of Detective Snyder . Hooker is immobilized . Snyder puts his hand inside his coat and slowly draws out his gun . He points it right at Hooker 's face and then violently smashes all the glass in the upper half of the door with the barrel . Fragments of glass spray into the booth , a couple of which imbed themselves in Hooker 's cheek . Hooker quickly whips open the door , trapping Snyder 's hand in the accordion and jarring loose his gun . Hooker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistol and gives pursuit . 96 EXT .

Hooker sits alone in a booth , with a plate of ham and eggs he 's hardly touched . The two cuts on his face have pretty much stopped bleeding . A big fan above the counter area drones away lethargically , it 's air stream insufficient to either cool the place or drive out the smell of onions and grease . A waitress , Loretta , emerges from the kitchen and ambles slowly over to Hooker 's table . Slim and raven-haired , she manifests an indifference bred from years spent delivering things to people who are rarely grateful for what she brings . Only a light scar on her left cheek hints at another side . &nbsp; LORETTAYou done ? &nbsp; HOOKERYeh , I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf . &nbsp; LORETTA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOOKERWhere 's June today ? &nbsp; LORETTA ( figuring up the bill ) She do n't work here no more .

Realizing that this is no joke , she turns and walks slowly but steadily to the bathroom . Hooker waits until she 's out of sight . 125 EXT . STREET Hooker goes to the front door and steps outside .

We cut inside the stall to reveal Loretta sitting on the toilet with her skirt hiked up . Right behind her , crouched on the back of the seat , is Hooker . Cole has finished his rapid inspection now , and having found nothing , looks around for Hooker 's probable escape route . He sees the open window and climbs out to find himself in a small air shaft , from which he knows Hooker could not escape .

He prepares to sight down his victim , when suddenly he realizes there is no victim in sight . Hooker , miraculously , has vanished . Cole scans the alley frantically for some trace of him . There are no windows or doors at the street level . Not even a drain pipe . Just brick wall . It 's impossible . Hooker has disappeared into thin air . Cole slams his gun into his shoulder holster with a curse , and starts back out of the alley , when all of a sudden he stops in utter terror . His mouth drops open and he chokes out the words : &nbsp; COLESalino , hey look . I did n't mean to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can come out , two bullets rip into his chest .

He stops and watches as she looks up and disappears into an adjacent building that advertises rooms for rent . After a few seconds , we see a light come on in one of its second story windows .
