Buying advice like frozen yogurt or barbecue <P> " I 'm horrified , " says California Attorney Max Goodman . " It just sounds cheap , " huffs another prominent member of the Los Angeles County Bar Association . Still another calls it a " crime . " <P> What has aroused these and other members of the bar association is a small retail emporium known as The Law Store , which has been open for business since the spring in Los Angeles ' Sherman Oaks , next to Mogo 's Mongolian Barbecue and a subpoena 's throw from Super Cow 's Soft Frozen Yogurt . The Law Store customers pay $9.95 to pick up a store telephone and consult with one of eight part-time attorneys in the West Los Angeles offices of Group Legal Services , Inc. , owner of the store . For an additional $10 , attorneys will write routine letters or make simple phone calls for customers . Sold also are a variety of " packages , " telephone advice and preparation of forms used for simple wills ( $30 ) , changes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These and step-parent adoptions ( $75 ) are the hottest sale items . <P> " What people need , " says one of The Law Store 's founders , Attorney Stuart Baron , 40 , " is accessibility , an attorney to talk to , the ability to pick up the phone and call somebody . " Indeed , according to a recent American Bar Foundation study , 36% of Americans have never used an attorney . In 1973 , with that untapped market in mind , Baron and his partner , Attorney Blair Melvin , 44 , founded Group Legal Services . Today the firm offers round-the-clock legal consultations by phone to 20,000 California families for annual fees ranging from $35 to $60 . For Baron and Melvin , The Law Store seemed a logical next step , and two additional stores will be opened soon . <P> So far so good . Yet many lawyers are concerned that the dignity of their profession , as well as the quality of legal services generally , will suffer if fast-food techniques are applied to the law . As Goodman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " In a fast-food operation , every hamburger is alike . But in law , every case is not . When you walk in and order a hamburger , they do n't tell you , ' Try yogurt , it 's healthier . ' They just serve you the hamburger that everybody else gets . " Several local attorneys simply fear The Law Store 's competition . " I sure hope they do n't make it , " says a lone practitioner in Los Angeles . <P> In rebuttal , Baron points out that The Law Store customers receive high quality individual advice from the attorneys they consult . " For the most part , " he says , " we handle cases that would never get to an attorney without a service like ours . " In the first four months of operation , 805 clients had generated $20,000 in fees for The Law Store , whose monthly overhead is $2,000 , not counting attorneys ' salaries that are currently being paid by Group Legal Services .
