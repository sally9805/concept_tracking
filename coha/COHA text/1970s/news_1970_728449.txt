American people and this country 's attitude toward France . " The United . States and France  --  as ' the President expressed when President Pompidou visited the White House , and a well-known fact of history  --  are historic friends and allies to this country and it is in this spirit the President feels President Pompidou should be received .

" We , are appalled at this act of discourtesy , which marks an affront not only to the American Jewish community , but to the gracious traditions of the people of France . " Had M. Pompidou not rescinded his invitation after we had gathered ' to meet him , we would have urged him to lift the arms embargo against Israel and to deliver to Israel the 50 Mirage jets bought and paid for . French Sympathy Recalled " President Pompidou 's antiIsrael , pro-Arab policy , shocks the many friends of France , for we recall the genuine sympathy and friendship extended by the French people to Israel in the past . It is gratifying to know that even now the majority of Frenchmen repudiate their Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course pursued by the Pompidou regime . " This course jeopardizes the cause of peace in the Middle East and encourages Arab refusal to accept a cease-fire and to negotiate a peace settlement with Israel .
