Few people outside West Virginia have heard of Diversified Mountaineer Corp. , and by now a lot of West Virginians wish they had never heard of it either . After 14 years of garish existence , the company has gone bust in the biggest cause clbre of the state 's not-exactly-voluminous financial history . Its collapse has brought embarrassment or worse to citizens from Governor Arch Moore to thousands of small investors who put their money into high-interest but uninsured D.M.C. savings accounts , and now have little idea how much they can recover . <P> It all began in 1960 , when a group of promoters offered West Virginians up to $10 million in stock in a company organized for the vague purpose of " engaging in diversified types of business . " Though the promoters never spelled out what those businesses might be , they somehow sold 1.5 million shares at $2 each . At first they seemed to have little idea what to do with the money . They tried some ill-defined ventures that did not come off . D.M.C. might have suffered an early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial savings and loan " business . <P> An industrial S and L accepts savings and makes loans at rates unregulated by the Federal Government ; by the early 1970s , D.M.C. could pay 7% to attract savings and collect 15% on consumer loans , both rates much higher than commercial banks or conventional S and Ls could fix . But the freedom from regulation carries a penalty . The deposits are not insured by the Government , as deposits in banks and regular S and Ls are , so if an industrial S and L squanders the money in unwise loans , the depositors have no protection . Between 1960 and 1970 , D.M.C. opened or bought seven industrial S and Ls in West Virginia and four more in Virginia , Kentucky and Tennessee . At its peak last year , D.M.C. pulled in savings of $52 million and made $47 million in loans . <P> The 1962 acquisition of one West Virginia industrial S and L brought D.M.C. the services of Ted R. Price . A superconfident college dropout who had acquired a working knowledge of banking during service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swiftly became the company 's driving force and , in 1967 , its president . Price immediately set out to make D.M.C. West Virginia 's biggest corporation . <P> He started an advertising campaign that featured hillbilly singers twanging the virtues of saving at D.M.C. He also diversified the company 's holdings by buying the biggest motel in Charleston , the state capital city ; setting up two insurance companies that wrote policies for D.M.C. lending corporations ; and organizing a brokerage house that dealt exclusively in D.M.C. stock . If shareholders complained that D.M.C. paid no dividends after 1972 , Price replied with the statesmanlike observation that " Sometimes it is necessary to sacrifice profitability for growth . " Last year he vowed to buy the First National Bank of South Charleston ( assets : $27 million ) and in anticipation he had already ordered installation of a bank vault on the ground floor of D.M.C. 's new Charleston headquarters .
