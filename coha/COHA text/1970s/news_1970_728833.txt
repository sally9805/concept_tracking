txt A group of irate commuters were treated yesterday to a preview of the Lakefront Festival water ski show yesterday and they did n't enjoy it a bit . One hundred fifty persons climbed aboard the 4:45 p. commuter boat at the Michigan Avenue Bridge for the seven minute trip to North Western Station . Most had sneaked out early to get a head start on the weekend . The boat pulled out on time , traveled 100 yards , and stopped in the middle ' of the river . A Coast Guard boat , a police boat and four other craft blocked the way . A short distance away three attractive young ladies were practicing ? water skiing stunts . The commuters did not applaud . Taking ever the loudspeaker , the commuter boat captain announced that the police had assured him the river would be cleared in 10 minutes . The commuters began to grumble . Ten minutes passed , and they began to shout . Most of their invectives were aimed at the two men on board ' a Coast Guard boat which putted next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tailored executives  --  train after train was leaving without them . " Take us back to the dock , " they shouted . The captain , who confided that he also was angry , backed the boat up to the dock where another ' commuter boat was loading , As the boat tied up , the jovial Friday afternoon atmosphere was lacking . One man was overheard proposing a riot . Ile explained that he wad rushing home because his wife is expecting a baby . As the frustrated commuters filed off the boat to catch cabs , buses , or to walk to the station , one was heard remarking , " I did n't think even Mayor Daley could close down a public waterway . "
