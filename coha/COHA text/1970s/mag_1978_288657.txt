A first-rate squabble about a second-rate book <P> In Scranton , Pa. , where somebody evidently slipped Washington Post Reporter Nancy Collins parts of H.R. Haldeman 's The Ends of Power fresh from the bindery , life was pretty much back to normal last week . The network cameras had departed . Law enforcement officials had received no complaints of wrongdoing , and did not intend to solicit any . Collins seemed to have had her fill of notoriety and , at the end of a week spent mostly in ducking interviews , said : " This is all very nice , but I 've got stories to get . " <P> In city rooms and law offices across the country , however , the publishing controversy ignited by her coup continued to rage , tending to obscure the fact that the book itself is all too often vague , unsubstantiated and poorly written . Newspapers and magazines that had bought serial rights to the book from the New York Times Syndication Sales Corp . were trying to renegotiate-or back out of-their agreements . They argued that 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned their expensive excerpts into damaged goods , 2 ) the Times had damaged them further by rushing into print after the Post 's scoop , and 3 ) the New York Times Co. had failed to provide adequate security against premature disclosure . <P> At Newsweek , which paid $50,000 down for U.S. magazine rights before being undercut by the flagship daily of its own parent Washington Post Co. , executives will wait to see how well Haldeman plays on the newsstands before figuring how much of the $75,000 balance they should pay . Times Syndicate officials , who had sold serialization rights to various publications for roughly $1 million , now estimate that , all in all , their take will be reduced by as much as $600,000 . Times Co. officials were not yet certain that they had sufficient grounds to sue the Post Co. , and Post Co. officials were consulting their lawyers as well . <P> Meanwhile , the nation 's two major dailies took the dispute to their editorial pages . After a Times editorial accused the Post of " a second-rate burglary of H.R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post in a lead editorial slashed back . Its coup was " first-rate enterprise , " wrote the Post , adding rather guardedly that there was no evidence that the book had been obtained by burglary . The editorial pointed out reasonably enough that when a publisher goes into the business of both " news books " and newspapers , " it is almost certain to bump into some of its most deeply held journalistic principles on the way to the bank . " But then the Post accused the Times of " managing the news " by - trying to maintain a predetermined publication date-although protecting a publication or release date is hardly what is generally understood by management or suppression of news . Even more absurdly , the Post compared its scoop to the Times disclosure of the Pentagon papers , appealing to the Constitution in the process .
