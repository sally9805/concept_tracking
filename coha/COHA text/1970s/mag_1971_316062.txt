To boost power and eliminate engine knock , oil companies have been stirring lead into their gasoline for half a century . Last year , in an effort to capitalize on the pollution issue , most major refiners began producing at least one line of lead-free fuel . Despite the public clamor about the environment , however , the strategy is not paying off . The new nonleaded gasolines , dealers complain , are selling at a leaden pace . <P> Non-and low-lead fuels account for little more than 3% of all gasoline sold , compared with about 44% for leaded premium and 53% for leaded regular . To attract more customers , some companies , such as Atlantic Richfield and Standard Oil of California , have already cut prices by a penny or so a gallon on their nonleaded brands . The response has been negligible . " Lead-free fuels have flopped , " says a respected Wall Street petroleum analyst . <P> Most oilmen agree that the price is the problem ; nearly all nonleaded gasolines sell for 1 to 4 more than regular . Oil-company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To keep octane ratings high enough so that gasolines will burn without knocking in Detroit 's high-combustion engines , they say , lead must be replaced with more expensive ingredients , like platinum . Some officials of the Government 's Environmental Protection Agency suspect that the oil industry may be purposely overpricing low-leads to make them less attractive than leaded products , for which they have invested heavily in refinery equipment . If that is true , the companies are delaying the inevitable . The pollution-control devices that automakers must install on new cars beginning in 1975 will be so delicate that they would be clogged by leaded gasoline . Predicts Robert Hart , executive vice president of Shell , which has spent $80 million installing nonleaded gas pumps and tanks at its stations : " The way the regulatory authorities are moving , it looks as if leaded gasoline will be a thing of the past before the end of the ' 70s.
