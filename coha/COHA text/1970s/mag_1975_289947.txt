Peachtree industrial area . Call after 5 . Refs. required . <P> <P> Donna Valentine , 28 , lives with her nine-year-old daughter and four-year-old son in a town house in suburban Atlanta . Her income from child support and her job as a sales coordinator at a construction supply company total less than $500 a month . The town house rents for $300 , and she needs someone to share the expense . " I just think this is the logical thing , " said Donna about advertising for a male roommate .

" If a guy and a girl are living together , even if there is nothing sexual between them , it 's not so unusual for the guy to be watching TV in the living room in his Jockey shorts , " says Joel Kaplan . " If the girl comes in with her boy friend , the boy friend is probably going to think there is something between the roommates . " Occasionally there has been . But usually the partners date other people . <P> Sexual Stereotypes . Coed living does not spell the end of sexual stereotypes . Women complain that they get stuck with a larger share of housework .
