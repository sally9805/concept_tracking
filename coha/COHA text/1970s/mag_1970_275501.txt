The South took a big , though uncertain step last week over the corpse of legally dead school segregation laws . There was more good will than ill , more threats made than carried out - and more confusion than harassed officials may be able to handle . <P> Only a small number of systems were initially involved , most in nonurban areas . The real test will come this week and next , when major cities will undertake a degree of desegregation , some through large-scale busing of students . The end result could be the classification of 94% of the South 's school systems as " desegregated , " though many students will still be attending all-black schools . <P> Hello Whites . The generally good beginning-marred by the bombing of an elementary school scheduled to be desegregated this week in Edgecombe County , N.C.-was exemplified in the semirural district that includes Thomaston , Ga . Most of the 5,700 students went to integrated schools for the first time . Threats of white disruption failed to materialize ; a black boycott fizzled . <P> <P> The legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninth-grader described his first day in the integrated high school this way : " You say hello to the whites in the hall and they do n't even speak . It seems like we 're never gon na get there . " <P> In Augusta , 170 miles away , the same depressing feeling moved Thales Elliott , a black Army veteran of 17 years who had lost both his legs in Viet Nam , to direct confrontation . Elliott , head of his P.T.A. , was watching an antibusing demonstration at the black school across the street from his home in a middleclass , modern , black housing neighborhood . It was total-integration day , and seven protesting white parents stood at the base of the flagpole urging a boycott . " I just had enough , " Elliott said . " So I put on my wooden legs , got in my car and drove over there . " Facing the demonstrating whites , he said : " I have kids over here . Consider your children . Act like a man . This makes me mad , man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Refused to Delay . Nixon Administration officials are watching closely , but staying out of sight in order not to exacerbate tensions , as more than 600 school districts follow federal mandates to end dual , legally segregated systems . <P> Even as the old issue of de jure segregation became a dead issue , Chief Justice Warren E. Burger made rulings on the appeals of five school systems involving what may become a still more volatile dispute on a national rather than sectional level : the question of de facto segregation , racial separation existing without legal sanction . As applied to the schools , the question is whether the law requires positive action by school officials , such as busing , to achieve racial mixtures that neighborhood schools , because of housing patterns , prevent . Without comment , Burger last week refused to delay lower-court orders for substantial busing in five large Southern systems . The court is scheduled to hear full-scale argument on the issue in October .                  @ @ @
