HAPPY END <P> Book and Lyrics by BERTOLT BRECHT <P> Music by KURT WEILL <P> Bertolt Brecht sought refuge in the U.S. in 1941 and went to Hollywood " to join the market where lies are bought . " <P> Happy End , a musical currently revived by New Haven 's Yale Repertory Theater , is really a larky 1929 gangster movie . The setting is Chicago in Bill Cracker 's gin mill . Bill ( Charles Levin ) is very tough but no match for the Lady in Gray , otherwise known as " the Fly " ( Elizabeth Parrish ) . <P> She masterminds a gang of bank-robbing thugs with monikers like " the Professor , " " the Reverend " and " Mammy " ( Jeremy Geidt ) , who are all kept in line by Dr. Nakamura . Made up to look like Dr. Fu Manchu and with an accent to match , Alvin Epstein plays this role with hysterical finesse . Enter a Salvation Army lassie , " Hallelujah Lil " ( Stephanie Cotsirilos ) . She falls for Bill , and redeeming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly plot with style , wit and perfect timing . The score is something more-a Kurt Weill marvel . Not only were the famous Bilbao Song and Surabaya Johnny written for this musical , but also half a dozen other numbers of rare distinction . They range from Song of the Big Shot ( " Just do n't get soft , baby/ For god 's sake never get soft , baby/ No ifs or buts/ Go on and kick him in the guts/ Go on and kick him in the guts . " ) to Throw Out the Lifeline-Soul Overboard . By turns , the music is astringent , lyrical , opulently erotic and as jazzily smoky as a 1920s saxophone . <P> Inevitably , this show will eventually find itself some off-Broadway niche-one hopes with this director ( Michael Posnick ) and this cast . ?
