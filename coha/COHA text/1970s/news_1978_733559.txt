Kenneth Clark 's March 22 Op-Ed article obfuscates a complicated and important issue by fundamentally misstating it . " No . No . Race , Not Class , Is Still at the Wheell Clark argues that racial distinctions are still more meaningful than those of class in American life . This surely almost anyone would grant him . The far more central issue , which Clark fails to confront , is whether the significance of class is increasing in the black community ( even if it is not presently of paramount importance and does not threaten to become so in the near future ) . If one examines census data on income and occupational shifts over the last 15 years , it is readily apparent that class stratification is a significant and perhaps growing phenomenon in black America . And the widening class schism in the black community can not simply be dismissed by arguing that few blacks are in genuine decision-making positions . The multitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the part of middle-class blacks To the Editor : One  --  clear , lovely morning back in the early fifties , the great French architect Charles-Edouard Jeanneret ? better known as Le Corbusier ? came to visit us on the 23d floor of the old Time-Life building in Rockefeller Center . Peering out across Manhattan through his heavy horn-rimmed spectacles , Corbu shook his head in wonder end , to the best of my recollection , quietly asked : " Have you ever imagined what a marvelous sight this island would be if one could bury it up to say , the 20th or 30th story , put in some trees , some nice curving roads and make it all into a kind of park ? " Answering himself , he went on : " Then one could take charming little tours through a fabulous collection of architectural ' folies des grandeurs ' ? late Gothic and Romanesque chapels , French chateaus , Greek temples , Ziggurat towers , shrines of all sorts , even immense allegorical murals done in colorful mosaics . Ah , what an enchanting museum ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintenant , c'est vraiment une architecture pour les pigeons . " Well , now ft seems that a revival of architectural romanticism is upon us once again . One reads that A.T . &T.; is about to add the top of a Chippendale breakfront to Corbu 's imaginary landscape . Citicorp has already given our pigeons a giant slalom if they could only learn to use it during On the Value of Lives To the Editor : How many dead Arabs equals a busload of murdered Israelis ? Do school children killed by guerrillas count for the same as run-of-the-mill adults ? How do we evaluate scientists or Olympic athletes in this scheme ? Ought we to have accepted Germany 's surrender in World War II or first killed six million of them as requital for the holocaust ? These riddles and other unbalanced equations are fiendishly suggested in Anne Fremantle 's April 2d letter in which she rejects Israel 's " decision to kill . hundreds and render thousands homeless in revenge for a busload . " JACOB S. HURWITZ Woodmere , L.I. , April 2 , 1978 To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some hope and much sorrow Edna Goldsmith 's " Of Commas and Teachers " ( Op-Ed April 2 ) . As a retired teacher and supervisor of English , with 20 years in a New York City junior high school , my experience spans the whole spectrum of the " teaching grammar problem . " In the beginning , grammar permeated the teaching of all facets of the English curriculum : direct teaching of technical grammar ; insistence upon correct sentence structure in all written work ; some analysis of form and style in literature . Not all pupils were able to absorb the full program , but at least some of it could be presented to all . I did this in my own classroom as a teacher , and later mandated it for instructors under my supervision . But , enough reminiscing about " the good old days . " Soon , the permissive element Ms. Goldsmith speaks of decided that creativity was being stifled if pupils were asked to write complete sentences , or use an objective case pronoun correctly in their writing . That the resulting creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , predominantly black housing projects in their own neighborhoods can not be ignored because all blacks suffer the " psychological bonds of racism . " Nor , for that matter , should one ignore James Compton 's recent warning that rioting in the inner city may well be directed in the future toward middle-class blacks as well as toward white business interests . In short , while the potential for class conflict in the black community is certainly not all-pervasive , it is also not negligible and can not be so readily dismissed under the rubric of race . Ultimately , of course , - the expansion of the black middle class may have important implications for race relations even without class assuming a primary importance . Although the evidence is quite fragmentary , observations from leading black scholars and some sparse attitudinal work performed over the last decade , suggest that black middle class concerns are , at the moment , highly individualistic ones . If this is indeed the case , then poor // Alex ' Greco the skiing knows ? But one suggestion is that A.T . &T.; follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urn that usually appears in the curved notch between the gables . And then perhaps work out a way to keep it full of worms . For . surely a can of worms is what they 've opened up here , and the future of our skyline may be even more fascinating than Corbu 's surrealist fantasy . FRANCIS BRENNAN Kew Gardens , N.Y. , March 31 , 1978 To Fill a Pothole To the Editor : Regarding the recent news item " Crew of 500 Working Overtime to Fill New York City Potholes " : Is the overtime for regularly employed city workers ? If so , would n't Commissioner Ameruso do better  --  financially and employment-wise  --  by using one full-time city employee on a full-time basis getting overtime , supervising perhaps 10 men from the unemployed in the city receiving straight pay ? Adequate supervision by the city employee would certainly assure taxpayers that the work would be done correctly . HAROLD COHEN Westbury , LI , April 4 , 1978 when even one brave teacher tried to maintain some language discipline . The new-fangled grammar systems ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the designers of the " new grammars " could not agree . The gross errors in grammar and diction which saturate our television programs continue to destroy our language . Those of us who struggled to maintain standards in the classroom have sadly given up . Ms. Goldsmith 's article gives me some hope that the swinging pendulum we talk about is once more moving in a more positive direction . The English language should be a joy to all who speak , read and write it . First we must respect it . Incidentally , I would be delighted to teach Ms. Goldsmith how to diagram a sentence . Not only is this skill practical , but it can be fun , too ! ARLYNE SAMUELS Bayside , N.Y. , April 3 , 1978 blacks may be suffering from a double whammy  --  not only has their economic position worsened as they are increasingly forced into secondary sectors of the labor market , but they are faced at the same time with a relative decline in in-group support from higher-income blacks . Again , Clark does not even touch upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black community , since he states the pull of race and class in absolute " either/or " terms , rather than discussing the shifting weights of each loyalty . It is the deepening isolation of poor blacks which now needs so desperately to be addressed and which , until quite recently , received such minimal attention . Affirmative action programs , for example , which have in large part been the focus of black concern over the last decade , have had only the sparsest of effects on the black poor , and may , ironically , widen the class gap in the black community . Dr. Clark may be right in arguing that " racial injustices perpetrated against all blacks  --  middle-class and underclass blacks  --  remain the unfinished business of American democracy , " but again , would we not wish to enrich such a statement by pointing out the overriding urgency of the needs of poor blacks ? Only when race and class are molded in a more sophisticated analysis will the changes that have occurred in race relations since the Civil Rights Act become more readily apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1978 Wage-Freeze Raise To the Editor : In 1975 , the transit workers got a " wage freeze " plus a cost-of-living adjustment of 62 cents an hour . Now , in 1978 , they got a 6 percent wage increase . The cast of the 62-cent-COLA was $42.5 million per year , and the cost of the 6 percent raise over 2L months Is $84.5 million , or about $48.2 million per year . It can be seen from the above that the transit workers actually got almost as great a raise under the " wage freeze " as they now have gotten when it is openly called a raise . JESSE BRYANT New York , April 3 , 1978 If Westway Is Not Built To the Editor : Much has been said about Westway . I am concerned about the conflicting points raised and I have analyzed the arguments and the statistics . The issues are : improvement of the transportation system , protection of the environment , and energizing the economy . First we must consider the mass transit trade-in proposal which projects the use of $900 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westway . The trade-in will cost New York City $50 to $100 million for construction of an alternative roadway , and will not be subsidized by Federal funds . For Westway , the city would pay nothing . The real transportation need Is to build a roadway and to improve mass transit . If Westway is not built we will forfeit 93 acres of parkland , and 60 acres designed for housing and commercial use . We will not have funds to remove rotting piers along the Hudson , and we will not be able to replace the air polluting Gansevoort Municipal Incinerator . If Westway is not built , we will build a street-level roadway which will cause more air pollution because traffic will be at breathing level , not controlled and vented as in Westway . Noise pollution will be worse . There is also an important economic need . New York has not significantly reduced unemployment and 300,000 persons are now unemployed in New York City . Westway and the related land projects will create 36,000 manyears of work and the multiplier effect of that income , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Local businesses will benefit , and the city and state governments will receive increased tax revenues .. This is 20,000 more man-years of work than is projected by the mass transit program . Importantly , Westway does not preclude improved mass transit . The members of the Communications Workers of America , A.F.L.-C.I.O. stand to gain no more than any other citizen from the construction of Westway . Our concern is that Westway is needed and we will support it each step of the way . MORTON BAHR Vice President , District 1 New York , March 29 , 1978
