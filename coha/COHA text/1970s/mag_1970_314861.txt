Few Congressmen gave President Nixon 's welfare reform bill any chance of easy passage when it was introduced last October . House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Wilbur Mills was skeptical about the revolutionary proposal , and his opposition would have been fatal to the bill . Some legislators doubted that even Nixon really wanted the measure approved . Therefore , it came as a surprise to everyone , including the President , when Ways and Means first gave the bill its 21-to-3 approval , and then last week sent the legislation to the floor of the House . Even more surprising , Mills agreed to serve as one of its floor managers . <P> Suspicion . The committee 's decision was both tactical and practical . Mills recognized that welfare systems throughout the country are on the brink of collapse and need more than simple repairs . Also , he was caught off guard by the Nixon message , and suspected a political trap . When HEW Secretary Robert Finch began attacking the Ways and Means Committee in public statements for delaying the welfare bill , Mills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this year 's congressional and gubernatorial elections , was more interested in a campaign issue than welfare reform . Mills thought that Nixon would fail to push for the bill , then charge the Democrats with not caring about people for not having expedited it . His way out of the trap was simple . " If he is playing politics , " Mills said , " the thing to do is fix it up and give it to him . " <P> Mills , however , misjudged Nixon 's intentions . The President really wanted the bill . He described the committee 's approval as " gratifying and encouraging " and called Mills to thank him . " He convinced me of his genuine sincerity for the proposition , " said Mills afterward . <P> The bill that emerged from the Ways and Means Committee was stronger than the one that was sent in . Mills could not support the Administration proposal as drawn ; the measure would have added 12 million to the welfare rolls without any real restrictions on eligibility , hiking federal welfare costs from $5.2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill . It still guarantees a minimum income of $1,600 a year to a family of four , even if the family includes wage earners . But the bill now broadens the requirement that those receiving welfare must work if they can or accept job training if they are unemployable . Thus , if an unemployed father refused to accept suitable work or job training , his portion of the federal grant , $500 , would be eliminated . The remaining federal funds would be made available to the mother and children through a trustee or local welfare agency . <P> Soaring Costs . " It 's not a welfare program , " Mills said of the committee version . " It 's a work program . We 're taking this out of welfare . " But not completely out of politics . One committee amendment will make the bill effective July 1 , 1971 , well past the congressional elections . The President to report to Congress on its effectiveness one year later . This will place the onus for soaring costs or lack of results squarely on Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reelection .
