txt Somewhere in the city , in the middle of the night , a large green private garbage truck hisses to a stop at the edge of a vacant lot . With a whirring whine of the hydraulic system , the back opens and 10 tons of mixed garbage spills out . The empty truck roars off , having saved not only the time it would have taken to drive to the regular dump , but also the $90 or so it would have cost to unload there legally . The problem of illegal garbage dumping , a blight on New York City for . years , has grown worse in recent months since the Sanitation Department , to ease the disposal of garbage collected by the city , reduced the number of sites where private carters can legally dump . In an effort to stem the illegal dumping , 16 armed , uniformed sanitation police officers are deployed throughout the city every night . The effort is not working . Across the New England Thruway from Co-op City in the Bronx is a milelong , 8-to-12-root wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years to a height of 20 feet . Scraps of wind-blown rags and paper cling to the cyclone fence and to the few scraggly trees that separate the thruway from the service road . The composition of the trash ranges from old TV sets and refrigerators to bottles and cans and splitting plastic bags of mixed garbage . The other day , crates of rotten tomatoes had been dumped in the middle of the service road , almost blocking it . Some roads in the area , like Tillotson Avenue , are completely blocked . In Brooklyn , a section of the Share Parkway service road between Bay Parkway and the Cropsey Avenue exit has become 93 strewn with illegally dumped debris that area residents and the Sanitation Department refer to it as " Tobacco Road . " In the middle of that area , on Bay 44th Street , is the Brooklyn School for Special Children , a mod- ern , tour-year-old tan brick facility for handicapped students with a landscaped playground behind it . Despite large signs saying " No Dumping " and warning of fines , garbage completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is creepingcloser to the school . ' Rabbi Morris J. Block , executive director of the school , said the school ? not the Sanitation Department ? put the signs up in desperation three months ago . " I began to get worried , " Rabbi Block said , " when the rats started coming out . It was nothing unusual to see them 10 to 12 inches long . " " Frankly , we 're not very successful in catching those guys , " said Commissioner Norman Steisel of the Sanitation Department . " Sometimes they come in convoys of three or four trucks with a radio-equipped scout car in front to see if one of our guys is around . " Private cartmen collect upwards of 25 percent of the 22 ; 000 tons of waste generated by the city every day . Until the beginning of this year , they could dump:their loads legally , along with municipal garbage trucks , at any of the 14 collection points scattered throughout the five boroughs . Delays on Equipment Last summer , however , the city began to encounter a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it dating from the turn of the century ? that that unloads barges at the city 's main landfill at Fresh Kills , S.I . Commissioner Steisel said that he had initially hoped to repair the equipment by next May 1 , but thargiven the continuing fiscal crisis and the difficulty of finding the specialized equipment , he was not sure when it could be done . Last August , he ordered some of his own trucks to drive directly to the landfills , rather than dump at transfer stations . This cost the city $60,000 a week in added overtime , which he said he felt amounted to a subsidy for the private carters . The Commissioner then reversed his orders ? only municipal sanitation trucks would be allowed to use the transfer stations . In response to strong objections from the private carters , Commissioner Steisel modified his order to allow them to dump into barges in lower Manhattan and in northern Queens between midnight and 8 A.M. He then further allowed them to dump during the same . night hours at a barge set up for them at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that site was s put out of service when the pier collaped . Court Closes Bronx Landfill The problem was worsened by a court order permanently closing the overloaded city landfill at Pelham Bay in the Bronx on Jan. 1 . This reduced the legal dumping places in the city to . three , none in the Bronx . " Up here on Gun Hill Road it 's over our heads already , " said Joseph Savino Jr. , a City Councilman from the Bronx . He blamed the Sanitation- Department for making it more tempting for the private carters to dump illegally by restricting legal sites and then not apprehending them . " They have n't made an honest effort to catch them , " Mr. Savino said . " We count hundreds of loads dumped around Co-op City . How can they not catch them ? We 're the only borough now without a dump for private carters . You just ca n't tell people you ca n't dump here anymore . " No one admits to the illegal dumping , but Salvatore Spinelli , a lawyer who ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , said his members were not to blame . Asked if there was not greater pressure to dump illegally now that the convenient legal sites are gone , he replied : " How can I tell them they have to travel a five-hour round trip ? I do n't know how these guys can survive . " As to an economically strapped city government 's having to pay extra overtime to get municipal trucks to a farBlocked due to copyright .

The New York Times/March 15 , 1979 ther-away dump , Mr. Spinelli said : " I understand the city 's economic plight , but we have one , too.r Frank Sisto , the first deputy sanitation commissioner ? cited the frustrations of trying to catch the illegal dumpers , who usually dump by night , but who are sometimes brazen enough to do it by day . vas *Oft in from upstate with my wife one day , " he recalled , " and as we were passing Co-op City I looked out the window and said , ' I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right in broad daylight . " Mr. Sisto said he could not get off the thruway to stop him . Because of the difficulty of catching illegal dumpers in the act , Mr. Sisto said , the sanitation police have issued only eight summonses to cartmen in the Co-op City area since the beginning of the year . " If we 're catching 1 percent of them we 're doing a lot , " he said . " But frankly , I 'm not sure it 's worth the money considering the fines we collect . " The maximum fine for illegal dumping is $250 , and given the slim chance of getting caught , it can easily be written off by the carter as one of the minimal costs of doing business .
