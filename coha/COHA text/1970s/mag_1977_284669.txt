THE DRAGONS OF EDEN by CARL SAGAN 263 pages . Random House . <P> <P> Like squids , scientists protect themselves with clouds of impenetrable ink . Not Carl Sagan . His jargon-free book The Cosmic Connection ( 1973 ) involved thousands of readers in the search for life beyond earth . Last year , during the Mars probe , he became a TV celebrity with plausible descriptions of the creatures that might be populating outer space . The Dragons of Eden should involve thousands more in the exploration of inner space - the human brain . <P> Sagan , 42 , occupant of a chair in astronomy at Cornell University , is not a neuroscientist . But he writes about the brain with uncommon sense and even humor . With many social critics , he recognizes that human intelligence is the main source of mankind 's present crises . With Albert Schweitzer , he believes that " only a worldview which accomplishes all that rationalism did has a right to condemn rationalism . " <P> The Dragons of Eden begins with a summary of how and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sagan describes the process of natural selection working toward the emergence of the creature Shakespeare called " the paragon of animals . " Sagan also explains differences in the structure of the paragon 's brain and those of other animals . He offers some idiosyncratic thoughts on why man 's neurological legacy makes him behave the way he does . <P> <P> The human brain , he points out , evolved from the brain of the reptile , one of whose species the Bible holds responsible for the Fall . According to Sagan , the reptilian brain , which forms the most primitive part of the human brain , still influences man 's behavior and may help explain one of his oldest fears - the apparently inherent squeamishness about snakes . " When we feared the dragons , " inquires the astronomer , " were we fearing a part of ourselves ? " <P> Sagan also wonders if the human fear of falling is not a memory inherited from our arboreal ancestors , who lived in trees and suffered when they forgot the effects of gravity . He speculates too on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is less a working out of subconscious desires than the means by which humans " debug " or rewrite the mental programs they have picked up during the day . But if this is so , Sagan wonders , why do infants , who presumably have little or no experience to sort out , seem to dream just as much as their elders ? <P> The author does not supply solutions . But arguing , as always , for life Out There , he believes humans must press for answers . Only by understanding our own minds , he maintains , can we hope to understand the other civilizations we are trying so hard to reach . Intelligent organisms evolving on another world may not resemble man physically or be anything like him biochemically . But they are likely to reason similarly , for whatever their worlds , they are still subject to the same laws of chemistry and physics . " Natural selection , " writes Sagan , " has served as a kind of intellectual sieve , producing brains and intelligences increasingly competent to deal with the laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other worlds that have evolved intelligent beings .
