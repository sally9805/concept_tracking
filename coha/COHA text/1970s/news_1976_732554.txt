txt Republican and Democratic Presidential candidates battled to a standoff in Tuesday 's three primary elections , with five or six major candidates winning at least once as the voters continued to send conflicting messages about their preferences . The voting , in three of the nation 's dozen smallest states , underlined the importance of next week 's tests in California , Ohio and New Jersey , the final primaries on the exhausting , 30-state schedule . In neither party did the results seem to give any one contender a signiacant boost toward victory . President Ford won in Rhode Island , lost to Ronald Reagan in Montana and South Dakota , yet gained 28 delegates for the day to his challenger 's 11 . Gains in Delegates Jimmy Carter won in South Dakota , lost in Rhode Island and Montana , yet gained 20 delegates compared with 17 for Senator Frank Church of Idaho , 9 for Gov . Edmund G. Brown Jr . of California and 7 for Representative Morris K. Udall of Arizona . The nonwinner , this time as in his seven other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both South Dakota Senators , George and James ** despite the investment of four campaign days that he could otherwise have devoted to his last stand in Ohio , Mr. Udall lost South Dakota to Mr. Carter by 4,500 votes . Evidently disheartened , Mr. Udall said that if he did not win in Ohio , " it may well be all over , " with Mr. Carter tile inevitable nominee . Mr. Church , the delegates , remarked that by his for Mr. Udall to step aside . , " If I had run in a series of primaries and had not won any of them , " the Idaho Senator said in Columbus , Ohio , " I would recognize that the convention would ' not turn to me . If I could n't win , I would stop running . " Mr. Brown , the 38-year-old bachelor Governor with a fondness for Zen Buddhism and Thomas Aquinas , emerged in the final tabulations as the candidate who most clearly exceeded on Tuesday what had been expected of him in the balloting . The Brown Victory In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big winner . Excluded from the ballot in Rhode Island because of his I late entry into the Presidential contest , Mr. Brown in less than a week persuaded 32 percent of the Democratic voters to support the " uncommitted " position in the state 's preferential primary . More than that , his improvised organization distributed thousands of palm cards to voters advising them which of the " uncommitted " delegate candidates supported Mr. Brown and which did not . Some of the candidates in the separate delegate elections backed Mr. Carter and some Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota . Early yesterday morning , it appeared that the California 's Rhode Island victory over Mr. Carter and Mr. Church would be a hollow one because he would gain few delegates . But a tabulation of delegate races by The Providence JournalBulletin , the only one available last night , showed that Mr. Brown had got his message across in the face of the confusing ballot situation . The final delegate count gave Mr. Brown 9 , Mr. Carter 7 and Mr. Church 6 ? totals that were accepted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary , " commented Governor Brown . Party officials in Rhode Island ? agreed . Charles T. Reilly , the state Democratic chairman , who has supported Mr. Humphrey , said the Californian had been ? helped to some degree by his Roman Catholicsm in a state that is 67 percent Catholic . " But he did it by the force of his personality , more than anything else , " Mr. Reilly added . " He took the state by storm . The uncommitted vote was a Brown vote , not a vote for the party organization or for our Governor or for anyone else . " The Rhode Island results raised questions about Mr. Carter 's prospects in New Jersey next Tuesday , another race in which Mr. Brown has been trying to co-opt an uncommitted slate . But the situation is complicated by the fact that the uncommitted delegate candidates have endorsed both Mr. Brown and Mr. Humphrey , creating a contest where predictions are difficult . Mr.- Carter 's campaign manager , Hamilton Jordan , said by telephone from Atlanta that the two states were not comparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but added , " Perhaps my opinion would n't stand up under Zen analysis . " Mr. Carter has continued to pick up endorsements in recent days , including those of Don Fowler , the influential party chairman in South Carolina , and Jerry Apodaca , the Governor of New Mexico . Broke 900 Mark - As a result of Tuesday 's voting , Mr. Carter broke through the 900 mark , reaching 905 delegates in The New York Times tabulation , with 1,505 needed for nomination . Mr. Udall , his nearest rival , has 3071/ .. The former Governor 's own count , which includes projec tions in states where delegateselection has not been completed , as well as some private commitments from uncommitted delegates , is 1,031 . Most politicians consider that figure realistic . If he can win 200 delegates in next week 's three priinaries , a goal that appears within . reach , Mr. Carter could enter the convention with about 1,250 , even without major new commitments . " If he pops through that 1. - 200 level . " said Rhode Island 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course is to get people moving behind Jimmy Carter . Does Hubert Humphrey really want to be remembered as the divisive happy warrior ? Do we really want to defeat ourselves as a party again ? I doubt it . " On the Republican side , the tally now stands : Mr. Ford 799 , Mr. Reagan 653 , with 152 uncommitted . If Mr. Ford has big victories in New Jersey and Ohio , as expected . and Mr. Reagan sweeps California , as expected , the President would have about 940 delegates and his conservative challenger about 845 . The scene would then shift to state conventions in late June and July . including those in Iowa on June 19. with 36 delegates at stake : Washington the same day . with 38 : Minnesota on June 25 , with 28 ; Colorado on July 10 , with 31 , and Connecticut on July 17 , with 35 . Rogers C. B. Morton , Mr. Ford 's campaign chairman , said the President would travel to Iowa , Colorado and possibly Missouri ( on June 12 ) to seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return to California . He will campaign instead in New Jersey and Ohio on Sunday and Monday , hoping to win at least 140 of the 164 delegates there . Mr. Reagan , confident that he is well ahead in California , canceled this week his plans to spend next weekend on the West Coast and instead will fly to Ohio to campaign there . Nothing that happened - T1 Tuesday upset any of their calculations . Mr. Ford won by a bigger margin than forecast in Rhode Island , sweeping the state 's 19 delegates , and came a bit closer to Mr. Reagan than forecast in the two more conservative states won by the Californian . But the pattern of power ? the President strong in the Northeast and Midwest , Mr. Reagan strong in the South and West  --  remained unchanged , as did the outlook for a fight that will last until the convention opens in Kansas City in August . " Brown can go into a small state and have a huge impact , " he commented . " But he ca n't just breeze into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At a news conference in Los Angeles , Mr. Carter said he remained confident of a firstballot victory but felt even more confident he would win if it went to a second , despite four losses to Mr. Church and three to Mr. Brown in the last month . The Georgian was pleased that his opponents had failed to shut him out , as they had
