" When a politician talks , a dean listens . " That , according to Dr. Joseph DiPalma , dean of Philadelphia 's Hahnemann Medical College , is the way some would-be students endorsed by legislators get into professional schools-at least those schools heavily supported by the state . Normally , no one is the wiser , but this month a federal trial in Philadelphia threw unexpected light on what apparently has been a time-honored custom . Herbert Fineman , 56 , the powerful speaker of Pennsylvania 's house of representatives , was found guilty of obstructing justice during a U.S. probe into admissions practices of Philadelphia 's medical and graduate schools . <P> Federal prosecutors introduced letters Fineman had written to deans of Pennsylvania schools in which he extolled candidates for admission . One , sent to the Temple University School of Law ( the university received $66 million last year from the state ) , bluntly stated : " I think it would be extremely helpful to Temple if the application were favorably acted upon . " ( The student was accepted . ) Mark Allam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Veterinary Medicine , testified that he had jumped a Fineman candidate over candidates who were better qualified because he did not want to jeopardize state funding for the school-which comes to about $2 million per year . Allam admitted he reserved ten spots a year for " special applicants . " <P> The jury found Fineman guilty of urging two medical schools to get rid of his letters of recommendation after federal agents began their investigations . Fineman could be sent to jail for as long as ten years . At the same time , the jury acquitted Fineman of charges that he took bribes totaling $52,000 from parents desperate to get their children into professional schools . Fineman resigned from the state 's house of representatives . <P> Two other Pennsylvania political figures are awaiting trial . State Senator Francis Lynch and former State Representative Stephen Wojdak have been charged with extorting $15,000 from a dentist to obtain his son 's admission to the Temple University School of Dentistry . The U.S. investigation is continuing , and the pressure has shifted from the dean 's office to the statehouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
