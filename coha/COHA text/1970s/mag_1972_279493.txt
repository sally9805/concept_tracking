The modern headquarters of Japan 's ruling Liberal Democratic Party was unusually subdued for a victory celebration . The banzais were perfunctory and beer toasts stood untouched . Even the usually ebullient party leader , Premier Kakuei Tanaka , looked less than exuberant as he painted in the missing eye on a huge daruma doll , a traditional rite signifying victory or success. * <P> The reason for the gloom was a disappointing showing in last week 's national elections for the lower house in the Diet . Even though the party was returned to power with an absolute majority , it dropped 17 seats in the 491-seat house . The loss was only partly recouped when eleven successful independents joined the Liberal Democrats after the election , giving them a final total of 282 seats . <P> The opposition Socialist and Communist parties meanwhile celebrated striking gains . Socialist Party Chairman Tomomi Narita announced that a new wave in Japanese politics had finally arrived . At Communist Party headquarters , thunderous banzais echoed from the hall . <P> Both parties had plenty of reason to celebrate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their seats in the 1969 election , made a strong recovery , winning 118 seats . The Communists amazed even themselves by increasing their strength from 14 to 38 seats , giving them genuine opposition strength for the first time . <P> The strong leftist showing-though not serious enough to dent the personal popularity of Tanaka , 54 , who took office five months ago and drew enthusiastic crowds during the campaign-means that the new Premier will face much tougher opposition in the Diet , which is scheduled to convene this week . The fact that the Communists will now be represented on the crucial steering committee will make it harder for the government to adhere to its legislative calendar . The Communists intend to probe more deeply into scandals linking the Premier to alleged real estate deals . In Tanaka 's own party , his rival for the leadership , former Foreign Minister Takeo Fukuda , 67 , emerged with the largest single faction and undiminished ambition to take over , should the Premier make a misstep . <P> The net effect was to put a brake on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics for 24 years . That was exactly what many voters intended . As Yasuo Onomichi , 27 , a Tokyo office worker , put it : " I voted for the Communists although I do n't like them . The L.D.P. is too strong . It must be checked . " One issue on which the electorate seemed resigned was the widespread practice of illegal spending on entertaining voters and sometimes making outright cash purchases of votes . In pre-election campaigning , one candidate , for instance , reportedly spent $20,000 to entertain an entire village of 1,500 for one night at a hot-springs resort .
