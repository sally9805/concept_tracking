Mrs. Arnow , born in Wayne County , Kentucky , is the author of The Dollmaker ( Macmillan ) , along with other novels and two social histories of the Cumberland pioneers . How was whiskey made from corn in a wooden still ? What was the difference between a shingle and a roof board ? Such questions plagued me many years ago when I was doing research for a social history of the pioneers in Kentucky and Tennessee . A good deal of study in books and manuscripts had not yielded all the details of daily living I needed to know , and I thought I might learn something from people in the southern counties on the western fringe of Appalachia ; where many descendants of early settlers lived . I was not disappointed . Many of the older people had much handed-down information on the old days , and they were kind enough to pass it on to me ; often they showed me things  --  a turkey call or a set of coin silver spoons . Yet nobody knew anything about making corn whiskey in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Used as a medieine in most early farm homes , whiskey had also been at one time the most impOrtant cash crop of many farmers , as well as the easiest way of getting corn to market . And not all of that whiskey had been made in copper stills . I was about ready to try elsewhere when a friend offered to drive me on a back road in the woods to the home of an old man who " ought to know . " The man was about 80 , and he had a long memory . He told me all I needed to know about making pure corn whiskey with a wooden still , his information being so circumstantial that I thought it might have come from practical application . I did n't ask . In any case I shall refer to him as Mr. Atkins . Finished with whiskey , Mr. Atkins talked of mining coal . He 'd dug coal in the West Virginia mines for several years back around World War I. One of the best 5 I I paying jobs he 'd ever had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he explained , coal companies had to leave big pillars of coal in the rooms to support the rock above the coal seam ; that is , for the first mining . After that first mining was finished , they 'd send men in to get the coal in the pillars . If the mine later caved in , ' it did n't matter . Taking out the coal in the pillars was called robbing . He 'd rob the coal out , of any mine where he could see or hear rats , even when other miners thought the mine was too risky . Mostly he 'd robbed mines with good thick seams , 6 feet , sometimes more ; but every once in a while there was a low roof and h01 have to crawl . Getting out in a hurry after he 'd lighted a few fuses was about the hardest part . No , he 'd never stayed in any part of a mine when a charge was to go off . Foolish . He did n't re-enter the mine to get out the coal until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to settle and the roof to make up its mind whether or not it was going to fall . He 'd never tried - to rush things . Still , he did a lot of robbing and made good money ; coal was selling well back then in the twenties . , I asked him if the work had not been a great deal more dangerous than ordinary mining . He considered : most miners thought it was . He guessed the only real dangerous part was shoveling up the blasted-down coal when there was nothing to hold up the rock above you . Do n't forget , though , he 'd had the rats . Rats were the best safety devices a coal miner could have . They were not trying to make money out of you . A rat knew when there was about to be a rock fall a lot quicker than any seasoned miner . They could also tell bad air and stayed away from it . First thing when he was ready to work , he put scraps of food around his dinner bucket . At noon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was aiming to set off a blast . Whenever ' he 'd go for his dinner or just for a drink of water , the scraps were either all eaten or had rat-teeth sign . In between he 'd hear the rats squeak , or see the shine of a rat 's eyes watching him out of the dark . He 'd always had the rats . Except once . That time he 'd been aiming to rob a big pillar in a back room where he 'd never been before ; it had a lot of fine coal . He 'd worked just a little while at boring holes for blasting powder , when he noticed he had n't seen or heard a rat . He went to his dinner bucket . AU the scraps were still there ; not even the loud-smelling cheese and bologna he 'd put out special had one sign of a rat 's tooth . He ran for his tools , grabbed his dinner bucket and high-tailed it out of there . He 'd made it out of that gallery and was getting close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him somewhere , it sounded as though the mountain was grinding its teeth . The awfulest racket a man ever listened to . Next morning he 'd gone back to the room he 'd been scared out of ; it was n't there any more . The rats had told him . My friend said something about being glad modern mines were safer than they used to be . There were also , he pointed out , more state and federal mine safety laws , and inspectors to see that the laws were enforced . He reminded Mr. Atkins of the then new 1952 safety mining law . Mr. Atkins shook his head . Laws ? Inspectors ? No , he 'd take the rats . Miners still got killed . They 've got no rats . In a big mine there 's an awful lot can go wrong . But no matter how many miners get killed in one accident now , not all the dead men and maybe no one can be blamed for the accident . But listen to the higher-ups . They blame all the accidents on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll know . Yes , I read the papers , and continue to read them . I also , for several years , lived close enough to Kentucky 's eastern coal country to hear a good deal . I have been in most of the coal counties several times . I soon saw strip and auger mining and learned that in the big pit and drift mines American technology was getting out more coal with fewer miners . I heard of coal cutters , conveyor belts , automatic hole drilling devices , and a great deal of other equipment , all powered by electricity . Miners have become machine operators . Modern technology , however , is doing little or nothing for the miner . Coal Mining continues to be the country 's most dangerous occupation . The federal safety law of 1952 was hailed as a long step forward in mine safety . Yet , between the passage of the law and 1968 , 5,500 miners were killed and 220,000 were " severely injured , " which could mean anything from the loss of a leg to blindness or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miners and ex-miners live with never enough air ' because they have breathed too much coal dust for too many years and developed pneumoconiosis  --  black lung . Since meeting Mr. Atkins I have thought often of him and his trust in rats . As the years passed , each with its toll of dead miners , I began to wonder if his opinions on mine safety were as crazy as I had first thought . I was convinced that Mr. Atkins had been right about who took the blame when , late in November of 1968 , I watched a television newscast of an explosion in a Consolidated Coal Company mine near Farmington , W. Va . Seventy-eight miners had been killed . The " higher-ups " so mistrusted by Mr. Atkins were out in force for the TV cameras  --  among them Mr. Anthony Boyle , president of the United Mine Workers . He had only praise ' for Consolidated Coal Company ; a listener would have thought those seventy-eight miners had suffered horrible deaths by an act of God . Mr. Boyle either did n't know , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mine since 1963 had revealed highly explosive coal dust in amounts far beyond the legal limit . There had also been twenty-five other safety violations within the past two years . However , not everyone felt about mine , deaths as did Mr. Boyle . Foremost among the fighters for better mine safety was the Hon. Ken Hechler , Representative from West Virginia . He and a few other men in both houses wanted a law giving inspectors the power to enforce regu -- lations . During 1968 , in addition to the seventy-eightkilled at Farmington , 233 other miners had lost their lives . underground . Opposed by all coal operators , by many Congressmen and by the Nixon Administration  --  and receiving little help from the United Mine Workers  --  the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act was fought over for almost a yea ! r . When passage of an only slightly watered-down version seemed certain , President Nixon let word get out that he would veto it . In the end , he did sign  --  after letting the bill wait on his desk for two weeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only set up a long list of safety and health regulations but also for the first time enabled federal mine inspectors to bring guilty mine operators into court . Fines for violations ranged up to $25,000 . Inspectors were also authorized to close mines they considered deathtraps . The same law recognized for the first time in the United States that black lung is an occupational disease of miners . The U.S : Public Health Service would X-ray the miners ; those found to have the disease would be compensated by Social Security . See " Coal the Killer " by Paul J. Nyden , The Nation , September 20 . No mine operators complained about that part of the law ; compliance would cost them nothing . Anything else , from keeping coal dust down to furnishing rescue masks to the miners , costs money ; so did proper ventilation and safer mine roofs . Some operators said that obeying the law would raise the price of coal ; others threatened to close underground operations and turn to strip and auger mining . They would not apply to the Small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mines up to the standards of safety demanded by the federal law . Too much paper work , they said . They also complained of the paper work involved in complying with the law . Others protested that they did n't know how to take dust samples . In late April , about four months after the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act became law , a group of operators representing the National Independent Coal Operators filed suit in a federal district court in Abington , Va . They asked for a restraining order against the more stringent demands of the new law  --  specifically , many of the safety regulations ; nor did they want to pay the heavy fines . The federal judge granted an injunction against the federal law . An Under Secretary of the Department of the Interior forbade any representative of the Bureau of Mines to attend the hearing . The temporary injunction , with no opposition coming from any source , became permanent and trial was set for November . Word was next handed down from Washington to the federal inspectors in the coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right not to pay fines , it would be unfair to fine any mine operator for a safety violation . Later , a list of fines was handed down from Washington . These were so low and so hedged about ' for the protection of the operators , that they could have been called laughable  --  except that , miners were being killed at a faster rate than during the preceding year . The power of an inspector to close at once a mine he deemed a deathtrap was also taken away , but not by the injunction . Washington ordered inspectors to telephone Washington for approval  --  or disapproval . The law as passed by Congress had stipulated that each mine should have four " thorough " inspections ' a year . This was changed by Henry Wheeler , a deputy director of the Bureau of Mines , into " Partial but Representative Inspections . " This meant an inspector was to go over only part of each mine , which could be the part the owner wanted him to see . In spite of sabotage from above , inspectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for coal and high prices had increased the number of mines ; during 1970 there were about 2,000 in Kentucky alone . Some half of these were small mines in out-of-the-way places serviced only by trucks . Such were mines number 15 and 16 of the Finley Coal Company . Located in Leslie County , Kentucky , on land leased from the Ford Motor Company , they were adjoining and served by one coal-conveyor belt . The average height of the mines was only 32 inches , but despite the thin seam , profits were high enough to warrant two shifts of miners , a maintenance shift , and a few workers above ground  --  a total of eighty-five men . Mine number 15 was first visited by Federal Mine Inspector C. E. Hyde in June of 1970 . He found fourteen safety and health violations in the one mine ; two or three of these concerned the general health and comfort of the miners ; there was no drinking water in the mine , and no toilet facilities either below or above ground . More violations jeopardized the lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulations of coal dust and coal along the roadways . Multiplying the danger from the highly explosive coal dust was the careless handling of electric cables : several splices were uninsulated , fuses had been removed in many places , there was evidence of cigarette smoking , and no one had tested for gas . Also , only nine of the mandatory ' self-rescue masks had been provided for the thirty-nine men on the first shift in both mines . Inspector Hyde 's power to levy the legal fines had been taken from him ; but he could still order the mine closed on the ground that the lives of the miners were in danger . The mine was closed over a weekend ; it was supposedly cleaned up ; the Finley brothers lost no production as the miners worked a five-day week . State inspectors also visited the mine at intervals and found twenty-four violatiOns of the state law ; many , of those classified as " potentially disastrous " were the same as those noted by federal inspectors : dangerous accumulations of coal dust , explosives improperly handled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous handling of electrical equipment . Charles Finley , operator , received letters from the Kentucky Department of Mines and Minerals politely insisting that the violations be corrected . During 1970 federal inspectors made six partial inspections , of Finley mines 15 and 16 , during which they found thirty-eight violations , most of them potentially dangerous . There were still no self-rescue masks , and in one ' section of the mine a sampling of the air showed eleven times the legal limit of coal dust . An inspector also came to investigate an accident that had injured one miner and blinded another . Another accident that killed a miner required a later trip . The inspector found management at fault in the death of the miner . No fines were levied against the Finley Coal Company . All power of an inspector to do anything but note violations had been taken from him by Washington . ' On the morning of December 30 , 1970 , thirty-nine miners were underground in Finley mines 15 and 16 . The foreman and his explosives expert were getting ready to blow out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the loading boom on the end of a conveyor belt that Finley wanted to connect with the main belt in mine number 15 . The other men were at their usual jobs . Shortly after twelve o'clock an explosion ripped through the mine . One miner near the entrance was flung about 60 feet from the mine mouth . The other thirty-eight miners were killed . Charles Finley , outside in his trailer , was unhurt . Dr. William Beasley , the closest doctor , was the first to examine the bodies . Back in Washington , Elburt Osborn , director of the Bureau of Mines , was soon wondering what , if anything , the bureau should do . That was decided for him . Sen. Henry Jackson , chairman of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs , and Sen. Harrison Williams , chairman of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare , telegraphed the acting Secretary of the Interior , Fred Russell . He was told that his Bureau of Mines must hold a public hearing on the disaster . Rep. Ken Hechler demanded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mines 15 and 16 . He , too , demanded a hearing that would cover " all aspects of the operator 's actions since the mines were opened , and the degree to which the operator failed to comply with the law . " He also secured a copy of the 25,000-word report on the Finley Coal Company disaster made by researcher Thomas N. Bethell for the Coal Miners Legal Defense Fund . Representative Hechler had the report inserted in the " Extension of Remarks " of the Congressional Record . Most of the facts given here are taken from the " Extensions . " President Nixon was so aroused by the disaster that he said he would do everything possible for the widows . He , or somebody , did . Social Security bureaucratic red tape was untangled with such speed that the widows with their ninety-seven children received the usual death payment only thirteen days after the disaster . The Kentucky State Workmen 's Compensation Fund was even faster . The widows were called together on January 4 to sign papers and then receive a death payment of $500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miner , regardless of age , at $19,700 , the widows would further receive 400 weekly payments of $48 each . The five bachelors were worth only the death payment to the undertaker . Several dignitaries , including William Boleyn , sent to represent the White House , watched the widows sign . Not one of these men bothered to tell the widows of a clause in the Workmen 's Compensation Act that would allow them a 15 per cent increase in payments if the employer of their dead husbands was found to have been negligent . By signing the papers given them , the widows forfeited their right to apply . The public hearing was held on January 6 , jointly by the Bureau of Mines and the Kentucky Department of Mines and Minerals . The two had already issued a joint statement saying that they believed the explosion had been caused by the blasting of a boom hole and had been propagated by coal dust . The huge , amounts of coal dust found in the mine by inspectors had no part in the hearing , though it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mines would accuse the Finleys of criminal negligence . However , shortly after hearing of the disaster , Bureau of Mines Director Osborn let the world know how the winds should blow when he said : " This disaster was not unexpected . We 've had two good years since Farmington , and we can expect one of these a year . " The " two good years " were 1969 and 1970 , during which 458 miners were killed , 255 of them in 1970 under Osborn 's " administration " of the new law . The public hearing could not be called a whitewash or a farce . Nobody took that much trouble . No mine inspector was called to testify , nor any of the widows , who had doubtless heard their men talk of conditions in the mine , nor the mine superintendent , a cousin of the Finleys ; and no victirli of previous:accidents was questioned . It was not the purpose of the hearing , Osborn explained , " to levy criminal penalties against the mine operators . " However , several witnesses were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finley was allowed to talk with the second shift miners before they were questioned . A fel ; V did testify that they had seen illegal explosives in the mine , but most said they had not . Investigators of the accident . could have told them that they had seen pieces of PrimacOrd , an explosive fuse that burns with a flame and is thus illegal for use in underground mines ; the inspectors found evidence that Primacord had been used to connect 100 sticks of dynamite to blow out the boom hole . Charles Finley , gently questioned on this point , did n't remember buying illegal explosives and said he knew nothing of the matter , He was n't pressed , nor was he or anyone else questioned about past violations . Osborn said he was n't interested in the past record of the mine . The most in-iPortant witness on the cause of the miners ' deaths was not called to testify . He was Dr. Beasley , the first and only physician to see the bodies . Of the thirty-      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
