txt In a move against concentrated ownership of the media , the Federal Communications Commission said today that it would block any new combinations of radio and television control in the same urban market area . The commission also announced a fresh inquiry into the Justice Department 's proposal . of 1968 that the many multi-media combinations that already exist be broken up . The commission proposed a new rule specifying that within five years the present broadcast owners would be required to reduce their holdings within a single community to one mass medium-4n AM-FM radio combination , a television station or a - newspaper . This proposal , made under the commission 's authority to control the granting of broadcast licenses , will be subject to further hearings and will certainly be contested by both the broadcasting and newspaper industries . In announcing the new " single market " rule for granting future licenses , the commission said it was " designed to prevent undue influence on local public opinion by relatively few persons or groups . ' Today 's ruling , which follows . two years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media acquisitions that would have increased concentration had been effectively suspended as the study proceeded . Any splitting up of newspaper , radio and television ownership as a result of the inquiry announced today would have profound consequences in the nation 's closely interlocking communications business . According to an F.C.C. report issued earlier this week , there are 256 daily newspapers in the country , including 14 in the state of New York , that are jointly owned by broadcast license holders in the same city . There are 68 relatively small cities where the only commercial radio station and the only daily paper are jointly owned , and 11 cities where the only TV station and the only paper are under the same control . New York City offers a variety of examples of media cross-ownership . Each of the three national television networks  --  the American Broadcasting Company , the Columbia Broadcasting System and the National Broadcasting Company ? controls local stations in television , AM radio and FM radio . The RKO General Corporation and Metromedia , Inc. , hold the WNEW. and WOR licenses respectively in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station WQXR and The Daily News owns WPIX-TV and WPIX-FM . In proposing that these and comparable combinations elsewhere be split up over ? a fiveyear period , the F.C.C. said that the public interest-required " the maximum diversity of ownership that technology permits in each area . Opposition Faced Divestiture of newspaper and television ownership would face powerful opposition from the communications industry . Yet the idea has won support from important figures on both sides of the political spectrum . Within the F.C.C. , the cause of diversifying the media has been advocated principally by Commissioner Nicholas Johnson . Vice President Agnew has also spoken of dangers of media concentration . In Montgomery , Ala. , last November , he made an example of the Washington Post Company 's control of Newsweek magazine and newspaper , radio and TV outlets in the nation 's capital . The F.C.C. 's actions today were endorsed by the four Democrats who still command a majority of the seven-man commission : Robert T. Bartley , Kenneth A. Cox , H. Rex Lee and Mr. Johnson . Dean Burch , the Republican chairman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissented in part . He said he would issue a statement on the subject soon . Commissioner Robert E. Lee dissented from ' the immediate freeze on new combinations but endorsed the study of future diversification . Exceptions to Rules There are a number of important exceptions to the commission 's new and proposed rules . Radio stations that operate AM service only in the daytime would still be able to acquire FM stations in the same market . And in communities of 10,000 people and less , where FM broadcasting is not normally profitable on its own , new combinations with AM stations ' will be allowed . Ultra-high-frequency ( UHF ) television , which in many smaller cities can survive only in combination with other established media , will be treated on a case-by-case basis . Neither the new nor proposed rules would prevent a company from owning more than one broadcasting station or broadcasting and newspaper outlets at the same time , so long as they were located in different cities or market areas .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
