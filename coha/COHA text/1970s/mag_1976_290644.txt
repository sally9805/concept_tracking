With only 72 employees and revenues of about $17 million a year , Dallas-based Aztec Oil &; Gas Co. seemed an unlikely candidate for widespread investor interest . But as far back as 1971 , the company 's stock began fluctuating sharply on the New York Stock Exchange . Activity became hectic last year , and in January Aztec became a full-fledged high flyer on the Big Board.On nine days it hit the most-active list : trading volume one day exceeded 400,000 shares , easily outpacing such giants as AT &T; and General Motors . More than 3 million Aztec shares changed hands in January-57% of the total outstanding . The price more than doubled , from $15.63 on Dec. 30 to a close last week of $32.50 . <P> Why the frenzy ? Mainly a natural gas producer , Aztec supplies several major pipeline companies , including El Paso and Southern Union . Anticipating deregulation of gas prices , which now seems close ( the Senate has passed a bill ) , the company allowed some of its supply contracts to expire and then bargained to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself to cash in on its large untapped gas reserves in New Mexico when prices go up , and 2 ) put itself a giant step ahead of competitors who are locked into long-term contracts and must deliver at current prices for a while even after they are freed from federal control . <P> Flocking Suitors . In Wall Street jargon , Aztec had become a highly desirable " special situation , " offering solid reasons for expecting big increases in profits . Total deregulation of gas prices could mean for Aztec a price of about $1.50 per 1,000 cu . ft. of gas-almost four times its current average . Nearer term , Aztec is suing Southern Union to force it to pay the fair value price for the portion of its gas not subject to federal regulation . A compromise has been proposed that could mean a substantial immediate cash inflow to Aztec . <P> With so much going for it , Aztec became a ripe candidate for takeover by other companies . The first attempt came on Jan. 2 : Mesa Petroleum offered Aztec shareholders $22 a share . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low . Aztec solicited other suitors , among them Southland Royalty Co. and Houston Natural Gas , which between them shoved the bidding to $32 . Then Houston dropped out , leaving Aztec to Southland , a Fort Worth oil and gas distributor with annual revenues of $65 million . At week 's end at least 90% of Aztec 's shares had been tendered to Southland , giving Aztec a new majority owner and enriching investors who bought the stock early . But there could be problems . Late in the week , the Big Board said it was considering suspending trading in Aztec because Southland 's new large holdings left only about 600,000 shares of Aztec outstanding .
