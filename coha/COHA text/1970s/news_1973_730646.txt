txt An economic trial of strength is under way on the Zambezi River with Zambia snubbing Rhodesia 's decision to reopen its 400-mile border with Zambia . By keeping its side of the border sealed , Zambia now appears determined to show Rhodesia that , blockade or no blockade , it can live without Rhodesia 's rail and road links . Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith 's decision to call off his economic blockade with his northern neighbor is thought here to be more the result of his own miscalculation than of any sign of repentance from Zambia . Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda has denied that any deal was made that would satisfy Rhodesia that Zambia was effectively dealing with African guerrillas based in Zambia who are alleged to be crossing the border . It was in response to the guerrilla threat that Prime Minister Smith closed the border . " Exchange derived UN diplomats who have just witnessed the Security Council 's decision to assist Zambia in finding alternative rail , road , air , and sea links for the landlocked African country are convinced that Rhodesia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign exchange in lucrative tariffs exacted from some 2,700 tons of Zambian copper exports railed through Rhodesia every month . Prime Minister Smith exempted copper exports from his economic blockade , but President Kaunda had no intention of obliging him . Diplomats here believe that all that Mr. Smith has done is to force Zambia to find long-term alternative routes . This may well be the result in the event of UN financial assistance . As yet no price tag has been put on UN assistance for landlocked Zambia . Nor is it yet known whether the UN mission comprising Austria , Peru , Indonesia , and the Sudan , plus six UN Secretariat staff , will still make its proposed tour of Zambia since the Rhodesian blockade is officially lifted . But it remains a fact that UN sources were considering aid more on a permanent and continuing , rather than contingency , basis . // * Zambezi standoff // UN economic support for Zambia would be justified on the basis of Artile 50 of the UN Charter ; The article declares that any state handicapped by UN sanctions can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor to Rhodesia is particularly vulnerable to UN sanctions imposed back in 1965 on Rhodesia for declaring independence unilaterally . The dispatching of the UN mission is a sequel to Friday 's Security Council decision condemning Rhodesian acts of " provocation and harassment . " It was a call upon South Africa to withdraw its troops from Rhodesia . South Africa denies it has troops there . A prevailing view here Is that Prime Minister Smith 's short-lived sanctions policy was a serious miscalculation that achieved little and angered his South African neighbors . It is seriously doubted for instance , whether closing a 400-mile border nonigi prevent guerrilla infiltration . As one informed source put it , the guerrillas " do n't come down the road in a car . " Prime Minister Smith may only have damaged his own case against the wisdom of UN-imposed sanctions , it is argued here , by himself resorting to sanctions . Besides , South Africa is strongly opposed to any sanctions for fear they will be used against it . Western spokesmen believe that the present situation underlines very strongly a Rhodesian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guerrillas would more likely be seen as outlaws by Rhodesian Africans . But without a settlement tribesmen already threatened by Prime Minister Smith 's government for . supposedly giving aid and comfort to guerrillas could become increasingly sympathetic to the freedom fighters .
