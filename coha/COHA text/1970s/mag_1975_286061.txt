There are at least half a hundred incarnations of Albert Brooks , and all of them are funny . <P> There is the elephant trainer who has lost his elephant and must get through his act using a frog instead . The trainer looms over the little fellow , urging him through his paces with a whip , trying to get the frog to perform such evergreen elephant stunts as Roll Over and Find the Peanut . <P> Then there is Dave , the hapless ventriloquist who tries to throw his voice while drinking a glass of water and ends up with a gurgling dummy . Or the comedian , running out of material , who demonstrates the techniques he could employ for cheap laughs : revealing funny pictures drawn on his chest or hitting himself in the face with a cake-a pound cake . <P> These cameos of desperation have been enacted over the past few years , usually on TV shows like Tonight , and have helped Albert Brooks , 28 , win a reputation as the smartest , most audacious comic talent since Lenny Bruce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jokes as wild ideas , bits of madhouse theater . His material offers no snappy punch lines to repeat next day at the office . Brooks makes comic epiphanies out of the giddy , gruesome excesses of popular culture . Like some antic Pirandello , he uses comedy itself as a major object of satire . <P> Prenatal Work . Brooks ' tone is usually foxy and sardonic , but his technique varies according to where and how he is working . He will shape his material specifically for a medium the way a stand-up comedian will tailor a monologue to suit an individual audience . Making a guest appearance on a TV variety show , Brooks will contrive a bit like Dave the ventriloquist that will capitalize on the occasion and parody it at the same time . Says his friend Director Steven Spielberg ( Jaws ) : " Albert is not only the funniest but the most visual humorist working today . " <P> But Brooks has worked equally well in other areas . Once , asked to contribute an article to Esquire , Brooks cooked up a six-page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School for Comedians . The curriculum boasted lessons in such niceties of the profession as " Working with a Drummer " and instructions in " an occasional heartfelt sentiment " to use between jokes ( " You 're a marvelous human " or " He 's a real saint " ) . He received more than 200 applications to the school . <P> Brooks ' fracturing assaults on the gilded traditions of show biz satirize both the medium and its message . His new album , A Star Is Bought-out barely a month and selling briskly enough to have found a berth on the charts-is entirely devoted to scoring big on show business 's own unlikely terms . Each of the record 's 16 cuts is specifically designed for maximum commercial air play on a different kind of radio station . There is , for instance , a ragingly patriotic lament for country-and-western stations ( in which the singer bitterly points out that " we play The Star-Spangled Banner at ball games , but still one team always loses " ) and for nostalgia stations a vintage 1943 situation comedy called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercials for war bonds . Since Brooks was born four years later , he calls this final selection " my prenatal work . "
