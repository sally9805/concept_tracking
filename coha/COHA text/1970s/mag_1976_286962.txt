In predicting the success of a new small car , an experienced oddsmaker would take the following into account : European roads are already jammed with minicars of a dozen different makes , sales of small foreign cars in the U.S. are slipping , and sales of U.S.-made subcompacts are declining steadily , while the rest of the auto industry enjoys a boom . So to put it mildly , the decision by Ford Motor Co. to drive into the transatlantic market with the smallest car it has ever made , the Fiesta , is a big gamble . The car is already in production in several European plants . Although it will not be exported to the U.S. until 1977 , it will be launched officially in Europe in September-on the 19th anniversary of the debut of the ill-fated Edsel , which eventually cost Ford losses estimated at $350 million . <P> If the Fiesta is a bust , the red ink will be much deeper . The car has already cost Ford $800 million . " By the time we 're through , " predicts one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change left out of a billion . " Five years in the making , the Fiesta came close to being scrapped a few years ago when the energy crisis crippled the European car market . But Chairman Henry Ford II defended the project and , not surprisingly , it survived . <P> Tin Lizzie . The Fiesta comes in three versions ( regular , sports and Ghia , a kind of minilimousine ) with a choice of three different motors ( 40 , 45 and 53 h.p . ) . It features front-wheel drive , disc brakes , trim lines , rear seats that can be folded down to make room for baggage and such smaller luxury touches as capacious ashtrays and rear-window wipers . It is 15 in. shorter than the Pinto M.P.G. , Ford 's smallest current U.S. model-yet , during a recent Fiesta test drive , TIME Correspondent Roger Beardwood had no trouble finding room for his 6-ft. 2-in. frame . <P> Fiesta 's European prices-about $3,200 for the standard version , $4,500 for the top-of-the-line Ghia-place the car in direct competition with such popular models as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We see this as the Tin Lizzie of the future , a car that will appeal to people everywhere , " says Robert A. Lutz , 44 , head of Ford in Germany . Ford plans to manufacture 500 000 Fiestas a year ; every fifth car will go to the U.S. starting in 1977 . In Europe , the numbers are on Ford 's side : since 1970 minicars have gained an increasing share of the market , notably in Germany , Italy , France and Spain . <P> One problem Fiesta will have to overcome is that brand loyalty in Europe is high . Another is that in countries where they are not manufactured , Fords are often discriminated against in favor of locally made cars . On the latter score , Fiesta has a distinct advantage : it will be assembled in plants in Germany , France and Spain , out of components manufactured in at least six countries . Says Lutz : " We call it the first truly trans-European car . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
