The sheer tensile strength of a woman 's will in Greek tragedy is unparalleled in any other literature . Of 33 extant plays by Aeschylus , Sophocles and Euripides , ten bear the names of women . Among the 39 Shakespearean titles , only three acknowledge women-Juliet , Cleopatra and Cressida-and all three share top billing with men . Sophocles ' Antigone is a test of wills between a man and a woman , a king and his subject . <P> Antigone wants only to perform the ritual of burying her dead brother Polynices . But he has died fighting against Thebes , and the city-state 's tyrant , Creon , orders that the body lie unburied . Blind as his predecessor Oedipus , Creon unknowingly flouts the gods in his overweening pride . Moreover , Antigone is Oedipus ' daughter . In Greek tragedy , the mills of the gods grind from generation to generation . Antigone buries her brother at the cost of her life , and Creon forfeits the lives of his son and his wife to the gods ' anger . <P> The revival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stature , the finest work that has ever been done there . In voice and bearing , Philip Bosco 's Creon is an image of power and arrogance until he receives his terrible rebuke . Martha Henry 's Antigone is a female javelin seeking death and wielding it . The myth may say that Prometheus stole fire and gave it to men . Actually , he gave it to women like Antigone and her formidable sisters , Medea and Electra and Helen .                     @x The sheer tensile strength of a woman 's will in Greek tragedy is unparalleled in any other literature .
