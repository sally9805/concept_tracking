txt Mexico City has finally decided to take a flying tackle at its pervasive smog . Mayor AlfonsO Corona del Rosal says that during the month an office will be set up to study this increasingly serious problem . In a valley ringed with mountains , the area has become a natural air pocket where fog and smoke collect . As a starter , a team of technical specialists will visit Los Angeles to study measures taken there to combat smog ? particularly the effects of car and factory emissions . Both are believed major contributants to the now almost permanent haze-cloud which veils the Mexican capital . And with the city 's population increase galloping at 400,000 a year , the seriousness of the smog problem multiplies , in proportion . There is general agreement that the decision to set up smog-study headquarters is an important first step that has come none too soon . 0 Raising cane A sour note has crept into Fidel Castro 's plan for Cuba to produce 10 million tons of sugar this year . Only last December the . Cuban Premier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a harvest of even one pound less he would regard as a defeat . Now he is blaming heavy rains and " subjective factors " for a slowdown in sugarcane cutting and grinding . Oriente and Camagiley Provinces are examples . Normally they account for 40 , percent of Cuba 's sugar production . This season their yield has been relatively low . In London , center of the world sugar market , specialists in world sugar tonnage who usually are close in their forecasts , suggest that Dr. Castro will be doing well to produce about 7% million tons ? instead of the coveted 10. m A people flood Current growth rate of Latin Americans is so great  --  more than 3 percent a year  --  there will be 2% times as many by 2000 .

After years of having its money . printed by the American Banknote Company in the United States , Mexico now is printing its own for the first time . A new mint on the outskirts of Mexico City now is equipped to pump out peso bills in denominations of 1 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 , and 100 . When higher denominations are needed , they 'll be printed , too . The first to roll off the presses , a 10-peso bill , is a brightly colored note honoring Miguel Hidalgo , the country priest who led the first independence struggle in 1810 .

But the situation does cause Argentinians to do a double take when they see three kinds of pesos floating around  --  the new , the Dld , and some . old bills that have been  --  stamped with new values . The latter two will remain in circulation for a year while the government gradually introduces its new notes .
