Never before in this century had the nation been so much at the mercy of its weather . Man , animal and machine in many parts of the country were immobilized under a heavy blanket of snow and ice . A dire shortage of natural gas - long predicted and long ignored - forced the closing of hundreds of schools and businesses and drove tens of thousands of people out of their unheated homes . <P> Economists estimate that millions have been laid off-in some cases only briefly-because of plant shutdowns . Just on the verge of recovering from its sustained pause , the economy has also been buffeted . The growth rate for the first quarter of 1977 has been scaled down half a percentage point , to 5% , because of the bad weather . President Carter 's economic package of $31.2 billion , to be spread out over 20 months , has been jeopardized : a large chunk of the tax rebates will be eaten up by an extra $7 billion to $8 billion in fuel bills . On top of this , food costs are soaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to buy additional livestock feed . Some economists figure that the inflation rate for the first quarter could reach 9% , compared with 4.2% in the final quarter of 1976 . <P> If there is too much winter in some sections of the country , there is , strangely enough , too little elsewhere . With far less snowfall than usual , the West is suffering from a prolonged drought . A shortage of water is imperiling winter wheat and other crops ; fears are growing that hydroelectric power will decrease in the spring . Water is already being rationed in parts of California ( see following story ) . In Oregon , forest fires have broken out . " Some say the world will end in fire , " wrote Robert Frost , " some say in ice . " Last week Americans had their choice of disasters . If that is not enough , they soon may undergo trial by water . When the massive snowdrifts melt in the warming weather , torrential floods are expected to sweep many parts of the country . <P> As a Southerner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north to the White House , he has been confronted , ironically enough , with fierce cold as his first crisis . He has responded with the activism he pledged . <P> <P> " If there had n't been an energy crisis , " says an aide , " we probably would have had to create one . " That seems a high price to pay for a demonstration of presidential leadership , but there was no disputing the fact that Carter was moving fast and forcefully . He dramatized the crisis-and the presidential role in it - by hastily convening a Cabinet meeting , then taking a quick trip to frozen Pittsburgh . He declared eleven states disaster areas because of snow or drought , thus making them eligible for some form of federal assistance . <P> Cooperating with the new President , Congress quickly passed Carter 's plan to ease the natural gas crisis , and he signed it into law-his first . The measure gives the Federal Government the authority to transfer natural gas supplies from areas with a surplus to those where there is a shortage . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first gas started flowing from the Pacific Northwest through a series of connections to Texas and then on to the energy-starved Northeast .
