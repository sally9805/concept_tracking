IT was a gathering of the clan , an assemblage of notables , a concatenation of critics , a precipitation of principals and , altogether , the grandest night in the recent history of Washington , D.C. At long last , the capital of the richest country on the planet had a cultural showcase of its very own . Costing nearly $70 million , the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts contains not only an opera house , but a theater , a concert hall and a gargantuan promenade longer than two football fields laid end to end . It had to be seen , if not admired , to be believed . <P> Everyone came to see and to be seen . All the celebrities sat in their appointed places , reaping their expected applause as they entered . Onstage was a production by America 's most flamboyant serious musician , Leonard Bernstein , who had written Mass and equipped the liturgy with a bold array of theatrical trimmings ( see Music ) . But the audience was almost as big a show . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked ladylike in cerise taffeta by Cardin . Joan Kennedy , the wife of Senator Edward Kennedy , swirled by in lavender crepe slit to the tops of her thighs . But sitting two rows in front of Mrs. Robert F. Kennedy was an unlikely figure : an Australian girl in T shirt , blue jeans and bare feet . Having come to stare , she had been given a ticket by an unknown man . " Are you staying ? " asked a bystander . " My God , yes ! " she gasped , then padded dazedly to her choice seat . <P> Doyenne of the Kennedys and the undisputed star of the opening night was Rose Kennedy , at 81 looking incredibly youthful , the closest thing to a Queen Mother that the U.S. offers . Glamorously Givenchied , she sat beside Composer Bernstein while Edward Kennedy , Composer Aaron Copland and Washington Mayor Walter Washington provided background . For human interest there was Mrs. Walter Washington in a wheelchair and a hip-high cast , refusing to let a pulled ligament interfere with her fun . <P> Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right by Sculptor Robert Berks ' imposing bust of the late President without noticing it . " I 've seen it before and found it very moving , but to be perfectly frank , I did n't look at it tonight . " Bernstein 's unconventional ways with the Mass upset some people , but not Mother Rose , who has been through too much travail to make stern judgments . " Jack would have loved it , " she said . " It 's the great expression of hope that is important . In spite of Jack 's discouragement , he always had the idea that things would be all right if there was enough time . " As the crush grew greater , Mrs. Kennedy asked where she should go . " Follow me , Mother , " said Senator Edward . " I 'll take good care of you . " <P> Notably absent was the former First Lady , Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis , who had talked Bernstein into composing the opening Mass . With typical Jacquelinian unpredictability , she first promised to appear , then reneged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But up until curtain time , rumors still flew that she might show up after all . Pestered beyond endurance by reporters , Roger L. Stevens , board chairman of the Center , finally declared , " She 's not coming . If she were , every photographer would have followed her every step of the way . "
