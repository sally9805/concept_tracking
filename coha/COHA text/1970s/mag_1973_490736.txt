THE TALI ( OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment A MADE-UP STORY : Basker and Letitia Filter had been in Washington only two days when a fairly good friend invited them to the White House for a party to be hosted by the President himself . " Basker , " Letitia said , " maybe this will be too fine a party for us plain folks from the South . They will just look at us and ! mow that we are plain and from the South and not high and mighty . " " Stuff , " Basker replied . " Ve are as good as anybody and fairly mighty , too , since I made my fortune in the Persian Gulf , and , besides , I voted For him . " " But do not wear the green hat , " Letitia said . " It clashes and makes you look as if from the South . " " This is the finest hat in all of Oklahoma , " Basket- said , " And , besides , I have stuck some poems in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and kVelfare , that I plan to read to the Chief Executive if I get a chance . " The first person they saw when they arrived was their friend Code d'Havenon , who was a well-known intimate of the President and had fixed them up with the invitation . Code was wearing glittering court dress , accompanied by an appropriately plummy manner , which contrasted sharply with Baskcr 's and Letitia 's air of social unease . " Well , there ! " Code exclaimed . " It 's old Basket and Letitia ! How are you chaps tonight ? Basker , take off that green hat . Letitia , you are as heartwarming as ever ! " He bent and kissed her hands as they walked through the long lines of silent gendarmes toward the fun . Then , the famous East Room , where a sparkling throng was displaying a lot of flash . The electricity was being wasted with a lavish hand , and there were three string bands in strange uniforms . Code d'Havenon took Basker and Letitia around , introducing them to the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President ? " Basketasked . " I do n't see him . Is he here ? " " He is upstairs in his study , working on the nation , " Code said suavely . " Usually , he does n't come down until eleven o'clock , to tell us that it 's time to go to bed . He is the father of us all , and that is heavy work , believe inc . And now I must leave you , because I spy over there the head of the World Loan Office and have to speak to him for a moment about a matter . Have a good time and try not to he too gauche . " " That Code has got a little stuck up since he 's been up here in Washington , you know that ? " Basker said to Letitia . She was grazing among the stumpy bottles of the drinks table , looking for some grass . " Well , he is a famous P.R . man , well-known for his fabulous entree into the regime , " she replied , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's just doing what he must . Do n't he so hard on people , Basker . You 're not perfect , either , you know . " Then , magically , the President was in the room , flanked by tackles , guards , and ends , and backed by three very big linebackers . " Peace , my children ! " he said , and then everyone got up from a kneeling position and resumed their conversations , sort of , but turned now toward the sun of his high visibility . " You reckon I ought to ask him what I want to ask him now ? " Basker said worriedly . " Or wait ? " " Well , Godamighty , Basker , I 've never known you to he bashful before , " Letitia said . " And , besides , you arc an influential citizen on your home ground . " " But lie never answered my letters . " The President was bent over a lady , smiling and holding on to her fingernails . " Citizen President , " Basket said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm from Norman , Oklahoma ? And I just wondered if you had a minute ? ' Cause there 's some things I been wantin ' to speak to you about ? " The guards and tackles and linebackers moved in on Basket very fast , but the President stayed them with a hand . " Pleased to meet you , Mr. Fitter , " the President said . " I 'm always pleased to speak to any of my children even the bad ones . What 's on your mind ? " " Well , " Basket- said , " the folks hack in Norman  --  and , indeed , the whole state  --  are gettin ' kinda upset about the teeter-totter . The giant teeter-totter you 're huildin ' for us that 's gon na reach from Maine TO California ? " " Arc you referring to the U.S. Interstate Bicentennial Tee te r-Totter ? " " That 's the one , " Basket said . " I know we do n't know anything about anything , being from the South and all , but a hunch of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is costin ' just a sight of money , and half the schoolhouses in Norman do n't have no chalk , and some folks in Norman are catio ' chalk , and ? " " Those individuals are certainly welcome to stay in any country that welcomes them , " the President said . " We all make mistakes , and in my view eating chalk is a mistake . But we have to pay for our mistakes . That is a rule of life . They certainly ca n't expect to ride on the Teeter-Totter . Teeter-tottering is good for you and it has important moral/economic runitications that you do n't understand , being underage , morally economically speaking . But let me give you something to take back to Norman with you . Ralph ? " One of the linebackers offered the President a brown paper bag . The President stuck his hand in and pulled out a large , red , round lollipop . " Here you arc , Mr. Filter . Enjoy yourself . With my blessings and good wishes . " " Mr. President , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " It makes what I feel is a very important statement ? " The President looked puzzled . Then he reached into the hag again and pulled out another lollipop . " Here you are , Mr. Filter . Enjoy yourself . With my blessings and good wishes . " And he moved away .

The group was the staff of Medical Aid for Indochina , a year-old organization that has become a center of fund-raising for the reconstruction of medical facilities destroyed by American bombing  --  including the Bach Mai Hospital , in Hanoi . About a dozen casually dressed young people were sitting at jerry-built desks and tables in a plain brick building at 140 Sixth Street , in an obscure section of Cambridge , tabulating some of the thousands of contributions that Americans have been sending to the Bach Mai Hospital Emergency Relief Fund . We had come to check on the progress of the fund , and we were offered a hard , straight-hacked chair . After a while , one of the workers , a calm , slender man named Bill Zimmerman , was able to leave what he was doing and sit down beside us . Itlr . Zimmerman told us how the fund had got started . " After Nixon renewed the bombing , we spent some time thinking of how M.A.I . should respond , " he said . " Then , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bach Mai , and we were confident that the Amencan people would he outraged . So we started fund-raising , and got in touch with a couple of dozen wealthy people who had been generous in the past , and after the first forty-eight hours we had pledges for a quarter of a million dollars . With that to start with , we held a press conference in Washington on Jarman 2nd to announce the formation of the fund . Ramsey Clark and several other people appeared and spoke for the fund . Then we began to run some newspaper ads , and those ads are still appearing . " Clippings of the ads were taped to the walls . In some , the headlines were " Our President Was Align . So the Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi Was Destroyed . " Others were headlined " Christmas in Hanoi , 1972 . The Bach Mai Hospital Was Destroy ed . " The ads also showed a photograph of the hospital , which had been the largest hospital in Hanoi and the major research-and-teaching hospital in all of Vietnam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised more money than any other anti-war ads ever did , " Zimmerman went un . " The one in the Times brought in fifty thousand dollays , and the ads in the two San Francisco papers raised thirty-six thousand dollars . We now see our role as stimulating people all around the country to organize fund-raising in their schools , churches , hospitals , and places of work , and also organize educational activities on the nature of the war imd the possibility of a breakdown in the agreements , which could Lead to a rantry of American forces . This morning , a woman walked in here with thirty-eight hundred dollars in cash . She had raised it from the staff of Massachusetts General Hospital . Everyone there was asked to contribute a day 's salary , and about two hundred people participated . We appreciate it more when a lot of people give a little than when a few wealthy people give a lot . " Zimmerman then showed us some of the fund-raising materials that M.A.I . had put together : leaflets , posters , a collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black disc pi inted with a white blossom . " Bach Mai " means " white blossom " in Vietnamese . We asked him if the Bach Mai Fund was receiving money onli , from the Northeast and the West Coast , and he said no  --  local offices for the fund had sprung up in Minneapolis , Chicago , Detroit , Pittsburgh , Cleveland , and Philadelphia as well as in Los Angeles , San Francisco , and New York . Some twenty thousand contributions had come in , making a total of four hundred and forty-nine thousand dollars . ( The total by the end of last week was five hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars . ) North Vietnamese authorities have estimated the physical damage of the B-52 raids on the hospital at three million dollars . Twenty-three staff members , two children , and an unknown number of patients died . We asked Zimmerman how M.A.I . proposed to send the money over there , and he said , " M.A.I . has been sending medical equipment and supplies to areas attacked by the United States for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . We have gone over to Vietnam and seen the equipment being used . We always send equipment , and not money , so that people wo n't say , ' How do you know the North Vietnamese are n't spending the money on something else ? ' With the Bach Mai Fund we would like to rebuild Each Mai Hospital , but the North Vietnamese will have to decide whether that 's a safe idea or not . A number of hospitals were bombed under the Johnson Administration and were rebuilt after the bombing halt in 1968 . Then , with the new Nixon bombings , they were destroyed again . This happened , for example , with the **26;4339;TOOLONG Friendship Hospital , in HaiFEBRUARY 10 , i 9 7 3 phong . It 's possible that the North Vietnamese will decide to build underground , decentralized medical facilities in the south- ern part of Hanoi where Bach Mai Hospital was  --  which would n't be as ex posed as the old hospital . If they do do that , we would use the money to help supply those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be affected by the cease-fi agreement , and he said , " The hospitals are still destroyed , and they still have to be rebuilt . They have been destroyed by the United States government , and the American people . should take some responsi bility in rebuilding them . Our project here makes no pretense of being purely humanitarian . The situation in Vietnam is ambiguous right now . The cease-fire agreement is the tal tC4 ) me of two decades of American failure . The United States government has still not achieved its strategic purposes in Indo-China . The agreements obviously will not lead to a stable political situation in the South . Therefore , the possibility ; I-ways remains of American military reentry , when and if large-scale fighting breaks out again in South Vietnam . At that point , Nixon 's decision to return or not will be based partly on the response of the American people in this post-settlement period ! " ? Sunsitinr ... ' Boy TIN Neil Simon 's newest hit , " The Sunshine Boys , " the leading characters , played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaudevillians who are generally supposed to be patterned after Smith and Dale , the legendary ornaments of the Palace and the Orpheum circuit , whose Dr. Krtinkbite act can still he quoted almost verbatim by their fans . ( Smith : " Are you the doctor ? " Dale : " Yes . " Smith : " I 'm dubious . " Dale : " How are yon , Mr. Dubious ? " Etc. , etc . ) In the Simon play , the old-timers are reunited after a long estrangement and decide to retire together to the Actors ' Fund Home . Well , we were flabbergasted to learn that the real Smith and Dale did end up together at the real Actors ' Fund Home , a pleasant residence . in Englewood with a resident east  --  averTHE NEW YORKER age age in the mid-eighties  --  of thirty-six . Charlie Dale lived there until shortly before his death , in November , 1971 , in a nearby nursing home , at the age of ninety ; his Timei obituary was illustrated with a photograph of Joe Smith poking him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prodding Jack Albertson in " The Sunshine Boys . " Joe Smith , who will turn eighty-nine on February 16th , is still at the Englewood home , and we paid him a pre-birthday visit last week . His once black pencil-thin mustache is gray and thicker , but he is mellow , lucid , and marvellously recollective , and names like Cantor , Jolson , Ed Wynn , and Fanny Brice trip intimately and affectionately off his tongue . He is also slightly stooped , and understandably so : during his encores , forty or fifty years ago , lie would carry three men off the stage . " Charlie and I were pretty good acrobats , too , " he told us . " I always felt sorry for people who were only acrobats . If they were good , they stopped the show . So they always had to go on opening or closing , with the audience coming in or going out . I gave up acrobatics quite some time ago . I 'm a cardiac case now , as a matter of fact , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes , my neck hurts , my back hurts , my leg hurts , and as for myself I do n't feel too had . ' " Mr. Smith escorted us to his room , a cheerful chamber decorated with old stage photographs , some recent watercolors he had done , and , among other memorabilia , a whistle engraved " Help Joe Smith , who helped the White Plains Police November 14 , 1924 . " " It was a widows-andorphans affair , " he told us . " If you put every benefit Charlie and I played end to end , it would be endless . " Mr. Smith went on to say that he has never met Neil Simon but has seen " The Sunshine Boys " twice . " 1 liked it very much , " he said . " Of course , it 's a paraphrase , but it 's very well done . They do an unfinished symphony in their doctor sketch , where the one fellow has a heart attack . ' Unfinished symphony ' ? that has funny possibilities . The trouble with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with it . I 'm even getting letters asking for seats , with checks enclosed made out to the Broadhurst Theatre . Not that it 's all that true to life . I never did poke Charlie hard , though I 'd point Inv finger at him and , if necessary , give him a little jab when I said ' You 're making a mountain out of a mothball '  - -  but I never hurt him . And as for all that about my spitting in his face during the act when I pronounced my t 's  --  why , it was he who spat in my face , He would say , Tor pity 's sake , you aggravate me , ' and like to drown me with that ' pity . ' At first , I 'd come hack with ' Please do n't speak so juicy , ' but that did n't sound quite right , so we changed it to ' Please do n't speak so fluidly ; when you talk , you speak April showers . ' And then , of course , the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'd argue about the act every now and then , but we were about as close as two men could be  --  almost inseparable and when I moved out here after my second wife died , that was it for Charlie . ' I want to be with you , ' he said . At the end , I had to take care of him . But I 'm very contented here . I 've had boats and homes , and no regrets . We have so much to read here that a person does n't have to he lonesome . I read a lot . When I had my heart attack , I had a heavy Balzac with me , and when a fellow-resident went berserk I figured if he came at me I 'd let him have it with the Balzac . My favorite authors over the years have been Montague Glass , Ben Hecht , and Octavos Roy Cohen . Neil Simon ? I do n't think of him so much as an author as How should I put it ? As , I guess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dale worked so long together it boggles the imagination . They made their first professional appearance in 1898 , just off the Bowery , and their last , at a Lambs Gambol , in 1968 . Both from the lower East Side of New York , they literally bumped into each other during the Spanish-American War . Joe , fourteen , was a shipping clerk , Charlie a sixteen-year-old printer 's apprentice , and , on rented bicycles , they collided at the intersection of Delancey and Eldridge Streets .
