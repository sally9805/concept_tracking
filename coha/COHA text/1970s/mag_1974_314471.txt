MONARCHS-IN-WAITING by WALTER J.P . CURLEY JR . 238 pages , Dodd , Mead . $7.95 . <P> They are descended from Robert the Pious and Gontran the Rich , from Suleiman the Magnificent and Cathal Crovedearg of the Wine-Red Hand . They belong , variously , to the Roman Catholic , Anglican , Lutheran , Moslem and Orthodox-both Greek and Russian-churches . They are , almost without exception , reasonable , personable - and , it goes without saying , well-bred . They consider themselves the legitimate claimants to the thrones of 14 European countries where royalty has gone out of business . <P> The putative monarchs include a Jesuit teacher-priest , a publisher , a salesman for Lockheed Aircraft and the nephew of Terence O'Neill , the former Prime Minister of Northern Ireland . Most are businessmen , bankers or gentlemen farmers , living , if not in castles in Spain , on the palpable hope of restoration as well as on decent incomes . Not one appears to be a dimwit , a dinosaur or a debauchee or even a gossip-column item . Perhaps the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis-Ferdinand , 66 , grandson of Kaiser Wilhelm II and claimant to the empire of Germany and the kingdom of Prussia . The prince once had a torrid affair with Lili Damita , an ex-wife of Errol Flynn . <P> Not untypical of the residual royals is the self-styled " Doktor Habsburg , " recognized by a handful of monarchist followers as Emperor Otto I of Austria and King Otto II of Hungary . Scion of one of the great European dynasties - along with the Bourbons , the Windsors and Hohenzollerns-Otto von Habsburg was exiled in 1919 with his then reigning father , Emperor Charles 1 of Austria ( King Charles IV of Hungary ) . Before the Anschluss in 1938 , Hitler offered to restore Otto to his throne if he would support Nazi ideology . He refused , and during World War II , when he lived in the U.S. , he advised U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt on Central European affairs . Now a spry 66 , he lives in a slightly seedy villa outside Munich , has written twelve books on political science , lectures indefatigably in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a savvy newspaper column that is published from Portugal to Peru . <P> The Reign in Spain . Author Walter Curley is an investment banker who once served John Lindsay as New York City 's chief of protocol . He points out in his genealogical mosaic that virtually all the monarchs-in-waiting are interrelated , and should at least have plenty to talk about . One can imagine a gold-plated dinner party for all the royals and their wives . But gad , sir , how to seat them ? If the places were dispensed alphabetically , Bachelor King Leka I , 35 , would have the honored position at either end of the table , since he is claimant to the throne of Albania and belongs to the house of Zogou . However , the Albanian monarchy was only established in 1928 , and among dynasts antiquity is all . <P> By the author 's reckoning , highest above the salt would have to be Henri d'Orleans , Count of Paris , an amateur pilot and accomplished horseman , whose royal line remained unbroken for 1,200 years . Here , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a formidable rival in the person of Louis Jerome Victor Emmanuel Leopold Marie , Prince Napoleon Bonaparte , 58 , who re-established his clan 's regal credentials as a doughty officer in the French Resistance during World War II .
