WAKEN AS A GROUP , cattlemen may he the last honest men in America ? shrewdly honest , in the manner of country people , not nobly honest , in the manner of the Good Book . When cattlemen agree to sell cattle to one another , they also agree which of them shall do the weighing . If the buyer does the weighing , he pays more . If the seller does the weighing , he is paid less . Similarly , when cattlemen arrange to divide a herd , they agree that one of them will work the cutting gate and then the other will have first choice of the half he wants . The results of such dealings may be as close to objective truth as human beings ever come . I worked for a cattleman once , the summer between high school and college . He decided I needed a good suit for college . Since I could n't afford his tailor , he looked up a store where they sent to the factory for suits made to measure . The salesman took my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a deposit . The cattleman bridled . He said a man 's word was his bond , and in his business thousands of dollars routinely changed hands with a handshake and a one-dollar bill . The salesman was nonplussed . He 'd never seen either of us before and could n't imagine trusting a total stranger . Two brothers I know run a 3,000-acre cattle ranch in Missouri . Their grandfather was the world 's most successful mule trader . He did a lot of business with cattlemen who rounded up their wild mustangs for him , before the automobile and the motorized cavalry condemned the mustang to dog food . The cattlemen would pocket his checks for months , sometimes for years , without cashing them . They carried them like savings bonds , secure in the knowledge that they would always be covered at the bank . But however admirable the honesty of cattlemen , their other virtues are mostly antique . More than one believes we should return to the gold standard . They are , as they like to boast of themselves , smoking their fiftieth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individualists . They work hard , but no one dares tell them when or where . They do n't even have federal subsidies , though it 's hard to believe they would n't like to . They think they are subscribers to an ancient and noble code of conduct , and perhaps they are , but the basis for that code is insecurity . The cattle business is so irrational that it calls forth the wildest kind of speculation , even today , when new commodities markets give cattlemen some chance of protecting themselves . Cattle prices may go up or down by 40 percent in six months . Capriciously . Imagine the high , bro ken windows on Wall Street if the Dow-Jones varied 4.00 points in six months . The effect of such madness on its practitioners is staunch conservatism , hidebound conservatism , in business certainly and often in politics too , born of a kind of lifetime systemic shock that leads cattlemen to believe that the only way to do things is to do them the way they were successfully more or less suc-cessfully ? done before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the author of The Ungodly : A Novel of the Donner Party . or HE REASON CATTLEMEN are con ' servative is that the business of beef is a stochastic business , a business characterized partly by order and partly by chance . The problem is figuring out which part is which . The breeder who mates a good bull with a good cow and gets a dwarf calf , the feedlot owner whose animals are at their prime the day the market goes up must be excused for taking the universe personally . Those who have little control over their lives are likely to believe in omens . As a result , your true cattleman is land-poor . That is how he can be recognized and differentiated from the businessmen in the business . Whenever he makes a little money , he assumes he is likely to make more , so he uses his money to buy more land so he can run more cattle . Having found , like Job , no other refuge but righteousness , all cattlemen are optimists . Cattle , opportunities in T RADITIONAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even at the expense of common sense . Building steam engines , manufacturing zippers were once risky ventures , but are risky no more . Cattle are as risky today as they were 400 years ago ? perhaps more so . Yet down through the years , respected correspondents have been grilling urban readers with fanciful promises of success . This is Gen. James S. Brisbin , U.S. Army , who published in 1881 a book BEEF BONANZA called The Beef Bonanza . Here he quotes a letter purportedly written by a wealthy Western gentleman to his impoverished brother in the East : Now let us see what we can do with a herd of 400 Texas cows , worth $5,000 , to begin with . At the end of one year the cows would have 400 calves , each worth 87.00. 1 count full yield , for in cross-breeding there is not one cow in a hundred barren ; neither is the loss over one per cent of calves dropped where hay and shelter is provided , an.d proper care taken . The same gentleman , when closely questioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the herd doubles up and dovetails so fast it is with difficulty we can compute increase . " Cattlemen are notorious for their dislike of paperwork , but they would envy the gentleman 's justification . To set the record straight there is Cowboy Arithmetic , a book by Gen. Harold L. Oppenheimer of Oppenheimer Industries , one of the largest cattle management firms in the world . Oppenheimer proposes no more than an 80 percent calf crop for purposes of figuring , and even allowing only eight calves for every ten cows he includes a deduction of 7 percent before profits for " culling . mortality and optimism . " Oppenheimer is optimistic about the cattle business , not only on general principles but also because he has studied the market carefully and knows the American scene well . He returned from Europe only a few months ago , where he found beef prices , mutatis rottiandis , as much as two-and-a-half times as high as ours . Europe has discovered corn-fed beef and likes it as much as we do likes it two-and-a-half times as much as we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prices are such that a choice steer is worth about four cents a pound more to European buyers , FOB Kansas City International Airport , than it is worth to American buyers , FOB the Kansas City stockyards , half an hour down the road . And the European buyer will absorb the cost of transportation , shrinkage , slaughter , and waste . The growing European demand for corn-fed beef is a dilemma of serious proportions for the Nixon Administration . Exporting beef will help our balance of payments , but it can only hurt domestic beef prices , i.e. , push them up . The optimism of dyed-in-the-wool cattlemen begins to make sense . High beef prices , causes of C ATTLEMEN ARE GAMBLERS , but not very daring ones.In their bidding against future price changes they are n't likely to bluff . For years they have held back only enough of the best young heifers to maintain their cow herds . The other heifers , the majority of heifers , went to the feedlots along with the steers , and then to slaughter . Since they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offspring , and the total number of cattle in the United States did n't much increase . Demand did . Finally , after fifteen years , prices abruptly went up . Even better ( or worse , if your point of view is that of the consumer ) , prices looked as if they would stay up because Americans , among others , will do everything but kill for beef . So this year the cattlemen are holding back every heifer they can find space to feed . They 're increasing the size of their cow herds . For the next two years , that decision is going to add an artificial scarcity to the very real scarcity of beef we 've been feeling . By then the heifers will have calved and the calves will have gone to feedlots , and there 'll be more beef for us all ? except that by then Europeans will be taking more . More Americans Kill be taking more . And imported beef , especially Australian beef , which we rely on to make up the difference at the hamburger level , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in beef prices was the winter that just passed , the worst cattlemen have seen in years . A 20 percent calf mortality was not uncommon . Those calves will never grow to be corn-fed steers . Land , decline and fall of T ODAY THERE 15 IsO MORE land available for the production of human food . What we have now is all we shall ever have , and urban growth , industrial decentralization , federal projects , and private recreation are reducing it further by about five million acres a year . The obvious result of this shrinkage is that the value of rural land is going up . So , accordingly , is the cost of raising cat-tie on that land . With land prices rising , cattlemen are finding it difficult to put together new , economical assemblages of land . To expand . To reap economies of scale . Their alternative is to use the land they have more intensely . You can squeeze 1,500 cows onto land that carries 1,000 head comfortably , but only by spending more per cow ? for fertilizer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has its limits . Crowded , muddy feedlots suffered worst of all from the terrible winter of ' 72 . Animals standing up to their bellies in cold mud do n't do very well . Because of these and other changes in traditional land values , rural rents are expected to double this year . The cattle industry is reeling with the shock of it . Guilt , a certain sense of L ARGE , ANONYMOUS CORPORATIONS do not feel guilt when their profitable operations add to the cost of living . Cattlemen do . For the first time in years they are making something like a 10 percent return on their investments , not a killing certainly but a welcome change from the 2 percent returns of the recent past . ( Sometimes they saw no returns at all . Sometimes they took losses of $40 and $50 a head . ) And now , as if some monstrous conscience leaned over their shoulders just as they lifted the apple from the fruit stand , they find the entire consumer nation mad at them . The supermarkets get boycotted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' worth of beef and give it away to dramatize their plight . Back during the first week of boycotting , the farmers along the Missouri River bottoms north of Kansas City posted their property against the gentle souls who go there every spring to hunt morels , which taste , incidentally , like beefsteak . The farmers put up signs explaining that they were barring mushroom hunting in retaliation for the boycott . " Enjoy your peanut butter sandwiches , " the signs said petulantly . Such emotional overkill suggests that cattlemen are feeling guilty about their good fortune and perhaps a little hysterical . They 've seen hard times for so long they ca n't really believe the demand for beef is going to BEEF BONANZA keep the prices high and even push them higher . They imagine that only now can they take such modest profit as has finally come into view . And for such ambition they have been scourged by the populace . It 's almost more than they can bear . Charolais , invasion of the T HE FACT IS , THE CATTLE business is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prices , profits and all , It stands today in about the same position that industry stood seventy years ago : at the beginning of rational management . Cost accounting is no longer considered an intolerable burden on the rancher 's freedom of spirit . Some cattlemen are willing to admit that there are other good breeds of beef cattle besides Hereford , Shorthorn , and Angus . Outside investors are entering the business in increasing numbers under corporate and limited-partnership arrangements , funneling in soft dollars that would otherwise go for taxes . The computer , by now the mainstay of American business , is beginning to find a use in the cattle business , calculating the complicated vectors of genetic improvement . Jerry Litton , a freshman Congressman from northeast Missouri , is as good an example of a renaissance cattleman as I know . At thirty-five , Litton has made himself prosperous by bringing innovations to the business of breeding registered bulls . He made his changes fast : Litton and his father converted their Hereford herd to a French breed , Charolais , in 1952 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " breeds before 1952 , most notably with Brahmins that could tolerate flies and summer heat . But the idea that Litton and others like him fostered , of introducing large European breeds to the United States , not for climatic adaptation but because they grew faster and produced more pounds of beef at an earlier age , was an idea that many cattlemen , including General Oppenheimer , are still skeptical of . Litton , whose family history includes hog epidemics , house fires , and accidents that left his father bedridden for years on end , had little to lose . He promoted the big white cattle from France at state fairs , renting exhibition space when cattlemenwould n't let him into their shows . He parlayed his small Missouri Char- ( - dais convention into a major national event among cattlemen by bringing in speakers like Arthur Godfrey , Walter Cronkite , and Ralph Nader , hiring Playboy bunnies to serve as ushers , and keeping a fleet of limousines standing by to whisk his potential clients around town . He used showmanship to get past the cattlemen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good product to sell . He kept his bulls out of the show ring for ten years because he was n't sure they would stack up against standards established for the smaller , blockier English breeds , but when he finally began showing he ran away with every prize in town . He was lucky enough to chance one day upon a young Charolais bull , named Sam 951 , who grew up to such extraordinary quality that he sets the standard today against which most other Charolais bulls in the United States are measured . Litton 's computerized breeding program is a model system ; by computing averages for each new calf against averages of all the calf 's relatives in the program , it becomes more and more accurate in its predictions every year . It can presently predict a calf 's weaning weight to within a pound and a half . Litton is wry about his innovations ; he says they would n't be considered unusual anywhere except in the cattle business Changes , long-overdue C HAROLAIS OPENED TICE GATE to a stampede of exotic breeds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Herefords or Angus or Shorthorn . The most promising , in my opinion , is an Italian breed developed long ago by the dukes of Tuscany , the Chianina , an animal bred for work and beef , that stands at the withers , when fully grown , six feet high . The Chianina has been known as a breed in the United States only since 1971 . Since live animals can not be imported directly to the United States , the Chianina exists here at the present time only in the form of half-bred calves produced from purebred Chianina semen artificially inseminated into Charolais , Brown Swiss , Angus , and other cows . Chianina that qualify as purebred-7/8 crosses for heifers , 15/16 crosses for bulls ? wo n't be available for breeding until at least the fall of 1975 . But an animal that drops an average-size calf that then grows so fast it weans at twice the weight of English breed calves , and weighs as much as 1,500 pounds at one year of age , is an animal of remarkable promise ? assuming that buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be penalized because they do not match the conformation of the English breeds . Changes in the cattle business appear to be coming fast . Considering the pressures of the marketplace , they could hardly do otherwise . Despite some toughened tax requirements ? cattle investors must show a profit at least every third year to keep their capital gains status ? cattle are beginning to look like a good investment . Oppenheimer Industries used to acquire many of its clients from the ranks of show business and Hollywood . Today , entertainers account for less than 5 percent of Oppenheimer 's clients , who arc for the most part bankers , investment bankers , and senior partners in large accounting firms , the latter being people who watch over other people 's shoulders for the best investments around . Oppenheimer lists four reasons why urban businessmen are choosing to invest in cattle . He puts the tax shelter first , profit second , glamour third , and liquidity coupled with reasonable security fourth . The immediate effect of price freeze 3A has been a slowing down of the changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of their heifers go . Feedlot men are n't putting as many steers on grain when grain prices soar while beef prices are frozen . We can expect to see higher prices than ever when prices are thawed . But , beyond the immediate future . it 's possible to see a market in which beef prices stay high and go higher as demand increases not only within the United States but also from the rest of the world and as the practices necessary to squeeze more pounds of beef from the same amount of land add more cost to each pound of beef produced . That 's where the exotic breeds come in ? Litton 's Charolais and breeds like the Chianina . They are n't likely to replace the English breeds but will probably be crossbred to the English breeds to produce BEEF BONANZA a bigger , faster-growing animal with all the benefits of hybrid vigor ( that is the response , in the form of health and growth and general vitality , that comes when two distantly related animals are crossed , suppressing undesirable recessive traits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the direction of what can only be called fat veal anyway , and if Chianina-Angus steer calves could be fed to the right weight at a much earlier age than purebred Angus calves are today , who would mind but those who like firmer beef and those who think you should n't breed upstarts to old retainers regardless of the results ? Do n't forget , though , that there are upper limits to the amount of beef that can be produced in the United States and in the world , and that the world is beginning to position itself to compete with Americans for a large share . Environmentalists have been saying for a long time that the world does n't have enough resources to go around ; no one ever said beef would be one of the first to he spread thin , but that is what is happening . Beef , low cost of ' ET BEEF REMAINS CHEAP in the United States of America . Jerry Litton has memorized the statistics ; he uses them to answer his colleagues in Congress . An hour 's wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ten years ago it bought 1.8 pounds . Less than 16 percent of our income goes for food . Ten years ago that figure was 20 percent ; twenty years ago it was 23 . In England 25 percent of income goes for food , in Japan 35 , in Russia 58 , in most Asian countries 80 . " So I tell my urban col , leagues in Congress , " Litton continues . " that one of the reasons most Americans have so many nice things is because they 're only spending 16 percent of their dollar on food . I do n't care what set of figures you look at , in none of them is food high . Food has gone lip 4.8 percent in this country in the last year , but in European countries it 's gone up about 8 percent .
