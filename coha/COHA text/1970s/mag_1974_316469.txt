Recession is a dirty word to politicians and one that even economists use with some trepidation , partly because it is difficult to define precisely ( see box next page ) . Nonetheless , five of the nine members of TIME 'S Board of Economists - Otto Eckstein , Walter Heller , Robert Nathan , Arthur Okun and Joseph Pechman-declare that the U.S. economy is heading into a recession , one that can not be blamed only on the direct effects of the fuel shortage . <P> At a meeting last week , the Board members revised only slightly their specific forecasts for 1974 . Several who had looked forward to an upturn starting at midyear now think it will be delayed until the fourth quarter . That will produce only 1% real growth or less-.3% says IBM 's David Grove . But most cling to forecasts that unemployment will peak at about 6% ( Nathan , an exception , guesses 7% or more ) and that consumer prices this year will average close to 9% higher than in 1973 . Though scarcely cheery , those latter predictions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The inflation forecast actually assumes some improvement : the Government reported last week that consumer prices shot up in January at a staggering annual rate of 12% . <P> Worrisome Risks . <P> What is new is a tone of deeper worry than the economists were expressing at the end of 1973 . Several concede that the economy could go down longer and deeper than they expect . While predicting a strong upturn at the end of the year , Eckstein volunteers that it may not happen . " It is possible that the economy will just keep on fading , " he says . " Then we will be sitting here with the worst recession since 1958 and one that would be more worrisome because it would have gone on longer . " Alan Greenspan , a Nixon adviser who does not yet use the word recession , essentially agrees . " The downside risks are greater than at any time in the postwar period , " he says . <P> The most important division on the Board concerns the course that the present downturn is taking and what should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Board 's more liberal members grant that the slide has been aggravated by the energy crisis . By now , they say , the gasoline shortage has seriously weakened consumer demand for cars ; for housing , especially in distant suburbs ; and for the merchandise sold by suburban stores that are reachable only by auto . So , they argue , the slump is taking on the characteristics of an old-fashioned recession caused mainly by inadequate buying . Heller and Okun fear that oil and gasoline price jumps will divert by $15 billion to $20 billion the amount of money that consumers have to spend for nonpetroleum products . <P> Mondale Plan .
