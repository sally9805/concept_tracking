This paronomasia is the title of a program designed to bring quiet to a city . It decorates a pamphlet that explains the plan and was recently circulated to the citizens of Chicago , where the city council this summer approved the toughest antinoise code in the U.S. In the eleven weeks since the code was adopted , Chicago 's department of environmental control has become the municipal version of the Silent Service , enforcing the new rules with a vengeance . <P> The job is enormous and complicated . In the Loop , Chicago 's downtown area , tall office buildings contain and amplify urban sounds like echo chambers so that the din occasionally reaches 90 decibels , enough to cause permanent damage to hearing in 10% of the people who might be exposed to it for eight hours a day . The slums , with their high population density and aging , ill-maintained automobiles , are often as noisy . Loudest of all is swinging Rush Street , where night after night the go-go clubs and rock bands blare out music measured at more than 115 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's formidable levels of noise , the citywide crusade for quiet is off to a good start . Environmental officers have swarmed through business and residential areas , recording violations on sensitive decibel meters . Offenders are sent to face judges who can mete out penalties as high as $500 plus six months in jail . As a result of the crackdown , residents are already beginning to notice small but audible changes . Car-pool drivers , instead of impatiently honking their horns , now wait silently for tardy passengers . The once clangorous chimes of St. Peter 's United Church of Christ on the Northwest side have been silenced-over the protests of the faithful . A particularly boisterous rooster in the same area has been exiled to the countryside . <P> Environmental officers are working to correct-rather than penalize-most other routine offenders . Confronted with a case involving a clattering air conditioner , Cosimo Caccavari , the city 's top acoustician , asked the owner to draw a floor plan of his house . Then Caccavari suggested moving the air conditioner to another location where it would not face any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose rooftop ventilators had brought complaints , how to build a noise shield that would stifle the racket . He also proved to officials of an excavating company that the vibrant rat-tat-tat of their pneumatic drills could be muffled. * <P> Sound Barriers . Still , even the ingenious Caccavari can prescribe nothing but new equipment for the biggest group of noisemakers : motor vehicles . To date , environmental control officers have ticketed 400 vehicles-most of them heavy trucks-for exceeding legal sound barriers of 78 decibels for a car , 84 for a motorcycle and 90 for a truck . The drivers can scarcely believe their ears when they are haled to the curb for a summons . " But officer , I was n't going too fast , " pleaded one truck driver . " No , but you were going too loud , " said the cop . Another trucker argued : " Our firm has 45 trucks . Do you mean that we 've got to put new mufflers on all of them ? " Replied the officer with quiet dedication : " Now you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
