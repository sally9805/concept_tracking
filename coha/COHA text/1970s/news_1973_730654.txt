txt Who really protects the American consumer in Washington ? Nobody , say a number of concerned congressmen , and they 're taking new steps aimed at convincing Congress to establish a strong , independent consumer-protection agency to battle the powerful voices of special interests in federal government . Last year a similar move became trapped in whirling waters during the final weeks of the congressional session . It became decreasingly seaworthy under intense business lobbying , quarreling among its backers , and refusal of the Nixon administration to pro vide active support . Finally it sank under the weight of a Senate filibuster . Proponents are moving this year to improve its chances of sailing upright through the buffeting They are guardedly hopeful it can , but no one is overly optimistic Percy ' optimistic ' Sen. Charles H. Percy ( R ) of Illinois , one or three prime sponsors of the strong Senate bill , says he is " reasonably optimistic " about chances that Congress this session will approve a **26;1061;TOOLONG proposal The other two are Sens . Abraham A. Ribicoff ( D ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . The two chief steps consumer advocates are taking in an effort to gain congressional passage are : ? Prompt initial consideration . Both the Senate and House committees plan early hearings , with early consideration by both houses expected . ? Changes in the Senate bill in an effort to win backing from the Nixon administration . As of this writing sponsors of the Senate proposal have not received word from the Nixon administration as to whether it will support the revised measure Hearings are expected to begin on the Senate bill the third week of March in the Senate Government Operations Committee Hearings also will be held In the Senate Commerce Committee . Senator Percy , a chief sponsor of the measure , forecasts that by mid-April both committees should be finished with the bill , and that it then will go to the Senate floor . // krf uonsumer-protection unit ? // Hearings are expected this spring as the first or second order of business by the House Government Operations Committee on a similar **26;1089;TOOLONG bill . Chief sponsors are Rep. Chet Holifield ( D ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( R ) of New York , ranking Republican committee member Their bill is identical to the one passed last year by the House , which the Nixon administration at one point supported . Most important difference between Senate and House bills concerns whether the proposed agency could participate in informal proceedings which government regulatory agencies hold before deciding many issues . Consumer advocates say this participation is essential , because it is here that government regulatory actions on consumer issues often are largely determined The Senate bill expressly states that the proposed agency could participate . The House bill is subject to differing interpretations . Mr. Holifield and some others say it would enable the proposed agency to participate in informal proceedings ; Ralph Nader and many consumer advocates hold the Holifield proposal would leave the issue up to existing regulatory agencies which likely would keep out the consumer agency . Intervention proposed What the Holifield bill says is that the proposed agency could intervene as a party " in any adjudicatory proceeding " of a federal agency other than one " seeking primarily to impose fine , penalty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rule out participation both in informal agency proceedings , where many judgments are made and decisions reached and in many formal proceedings ? since they frequently lead to fines or penalties . Sponsors of the Senate bill hope the changes in their proposal since last year may lead to Nixon administration support These changes would : ? Eliminate a controversial provision which would have required regulatory agencies to file " consumer impact " statements , akin to present environmental-impact statements on pending regulatory decisions . Critics charged it would have resulted in much bureaucracy , but little effect . ? Provide the proposed agency with " full opportunity " to present the consumer 's case in regulatory agency proceedings , rather than last year 's " equal opportunity . " Critics had charged under " equal opportunity " the consumer agency could have had disproportionate weight and even interference in the operation of regulatory agencies . ? Move to protect trade secrets which do not involve safety , health , fraud , or " unconscionable conduct . " Under the new bill a host regulatory agency would be required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed agency ; the manufacturer then would have time to go to court to prevent disclosure .
