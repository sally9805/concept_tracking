The cities of Latin America are littered with cardboard and packing-crate shantytowns that house hordes of landless peasants in search of jobs . Usually such squatters ' settlements are either deliberately overlooked by officialdom or broken up by police within a few days . In the Chilean capital of Santiago , however , a luxuriantly mustached leftist named Victor Toro , 28 , has founded a poblacion callampa ( " mushroom town " ) that the government can not ignore and the police can not destroy . <P> Last Jan. 26 , Toro led 3,000 of his followers onto a two-acre patch of land a few miles from Santiago 's center . Then he delegated a squad of men and women armed with pistols and machine guns to guard the compound 's perimeter and keep the police out . " The police come only to rob , beat or ' bribe , " declared Toro . Impressed by his tough tone , the police kept a respectful distance . <P> Outside Income . " Our enemies are the national bourgeoisie and Yanqui imperialism , " Toro announced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as the " Paradise Commune . " Members adopted an eleven-point code of conduct . Among other things , it forbade fighting , wife-beating , card games and the " capitalist sin " of alcohol . Along with communal chores , members read from the writings of Mao Tse-tung , Fidel Castro and Che Guevara . At least half of Paradise 's adults are unemployed , but leaders boasted that funds were coming in from bank robberies . As Toro said : " We do not promise . We do " <P> At times Toro seemed determined to provoke a police attack . Chilean authorities seemed equally determined to avoid a confrontation , insisting only that the commune move to a new twelve-acre site half a mile away . Officials even promised to build a park and soccer field near by . Nonetheless , violence finally broke out two weeks ago . <P> A few days after the move to the new site , 200 of Toro 's followers attacked and occupied an adjacent bungalow that the police had built as their local headquarters . The crowd wanted it used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ si , carabinero no " ( Hospital yes , police no ) . Four hours later , the police returned with reinforcements , and after a barrage of tear gas and a volley of shots recaptured their headquarters . But they refused to pursue their challengers into the commune , even though at least six of its members had been accused of holding up banks . Toro him self , charged with harboring bank robbers , had already gone into hiding . <P> Stoned to Death . The government 's reticence in dealing with Toro 's brazen band of revolutionaries may be related to the approach of national elections in September . Toro and his followers belong to the Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionario , a radical organization that enjoys the support of no more than 3% of Chile 's electorate . But the radicals are symptomatic of a mood of unease that could turn Chile into the hemisphere 's first country with a freely elected Communist government .
