txt The plummeting national birth rate and the decline in unwanted births have been linked in new findings to a dramatic increase in American married couples ' use of the three most effective methods of contraception  --  the pill , sterilization and the intrauterine device . The findings , based on a representative sample of 5,884 married women living with their husbands , indicate that by the end of 1970 nearly 6 in 10 married couples using contraception were relying on one of these methods . Only five years earlier , fewer than 4 in 10 were using such methods . Although many population experts had speculated on the role contraception has played in the decline in national fertility , now at a record low , these new findings provide the first concrete evidence . They have emerged from a comparison of data gathered in 1965 and 1970 for the authoritative National Fertility Study , direct . ed by Dr. Charles Westoff and Dr. Norman Ryder of Princeton University . " It seems clear that the immediate explanation for the decline in the birth rate has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this dramatic improvement in the use of more effective methods of contraception , " Dr. Westoff said yesterday in an interview . " We 're still pretty far down the road , but we 're coming closer to the ' perfect contraceptive ' society , where the overwhelming majority of births will occur if and when , people want them to , " Dr. Westoff said . " This could result in more abrupt variations in the birth rate , " he added . Dr. Ryder called the change in contraceptive practice over the short period of five years " revolutionary . " " One of the most dramatic findings , " according to a report by Dr. Westoff published yesterday in the current issue of Family Planning Perspectives , " is the fact that voluntary sterilization has become the most popular method of contraception currently used by older couples ( in which the wife is between ages 30 and 44 ) . " One-quarter of these couples who were using any contraception had been surgically sterilized by the end of 1970 . In 1965 , the comparable figure was 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age group was found to be the pill , used by one in five couples , an increase of 8 percentage points since 1965 . Another major finding was the evidence that the /most effective contraceptive methods are now nearly equally used by whites and blacks and by couples from higher and lower educational levels . The only major difference in contraceptive practice of black and white couples found was that in black couples using sterilization , it was nearly always the wife who was sterilized , while in white couples , the operation was slightly more common among husbands than wives . Despite . the move toward more effective contraception , there was no significant change , in the proportion of married couples who said they had never used contraceptives ? from 17 per cent in 1965 to nearly 16 per cent in 1970 , with younger couples accounting entirely for the decline . Discounting those couples who were recently married or were infertile , the authors found that only about 4 per cent of married couples had never used contraception for " social or motivational reasons . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that occurred toward the end of the study period had little effect on the use of the pill . The pill 's popularity grew from 24 per cent of couples using contraception in 1965 to 34 per cent in 1970 , making it " by far the most popular method of contraception " in the country . The use of intrauterine devices increased from 1.2 per cent of all wives using contraception to 7.4 per cent by 1970 , with blacks and whites relying on the method about equally . ) In turn , all the other less effective methods of contraception ? except foam ? declined in popularity . Use of the rhythm method , a contraceptive practice once popular among Roman Catholic couples , declined from 7 per cent to 4 per cent of married couples . All told , at the time of the survey 65 per cent of the couples interviewed were then practicing contraception , Of the remaining 35 per cent of couples , 14.5 per cent were either pregnant , in the postpartum period , or trying to conceive ; 13 per cent were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using contraceptives for a variety of other reasons .
