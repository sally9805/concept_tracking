I HAVE ALWAYS KEPT UP A GOOD COMMERCE with whores , but never so much as when I started to gamble . This was not , I stress , due to gambling 's having a fierce , aphrodisiac core . Just the opposite : I could sit , as I did , in one of New York 's more interesting saloons , encased in the structure of a poker game , and stare only with a removed , avuncular pleasure at the lean young girls of our age , girls whom nature and fashion have conspired to make the happiest examples of healthy proportion since he species began . With cool wonder . / watched their rumps undulating beneath Pucci designs and all that stirred in me was a general aesthetic glow , a warm , vague appreciation of the living creatures who formed the setting for the excitement and agony of the cards in front of me , I had , after all , entered a world of demanding renunciation , and no promising glance , no inviting twist to the features of these exquisite creatures could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another card or hand to he played . I had discovered the cold , pure enjoyment of being encapsulated in something of deep meaning and demand , and I was at last comprehending the force that had kept a Humboldt in search of another specimen , a Goethe another line , a Caesar another province . It is , after all , our compulsions which turn us into great men . But the whores ? Well , they were simply there , as they have always been in my life , waiting in attendance . I had come to know and trust our experiences together , for it was to them that l had long ago entrusted my first desires , and although at this time that may seem a quaint practice , I must plead that the neighborhood in which I grew up did not in any way anticipate the sexual carnival we enjoy today . Then , there seemed only two types of women to choose from : Irish Catholics and Italian Catholics , and both were glum objects to daily with .

As for the Italians of postwar Jacks , Heights on Long Island , you could , for the me part , color them a shade darker than their fri sisters and leave it at that . There were , of course , few who exploded like glandular volcanoes durit the seventh and eighth grades , but their unabash , ripeness was too much for someone like myse someone whose masturbatory spectacles still look , for a prepubescent angularity in their performer Besides , these Mediterranean girls always seemed have a shadowy escort of watchful , unhumorous n atives , and , over all their precocious sexual Rat boyance , there hung a cloud of heavy Neap ? lit. domesticity . As an example , there was a sweet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1% ! always wore starched white dresses to set off h olive skin , and with whom I had been flirting for month in a sulky , twelve-year-oid manlier . Final one quiet summer afternoon , she let me know th I had been accepted as a boyfriend , and , after had adjourned to a vacant lot to kiss , she invited r solemnly to her house . I did n't know exactly wh to expect from this invitation but what I found w some fifteen relatives , clustered in the chiaroscu of a tiny , airless parlor , weeping over a coffin which Tina 's uncle lay supporting a little pyram of flowers on his chest . Tina led me up to the corp : cried a little and then squeezed my hand . When I f that trusting pressure , it was as if I had been pinned to the very hub of the cyclical life of the Spagnolo family ? a cadaver and a hand squeeze , death and regeneration . Suddenly , the body of the dead uncle did n't bother me nearly so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life which , even in my biological ignorance , I sensed Tina kept hidden in her womb . Stretched out among the sobs and shadows of that parlor was a living tedium more frightening than any final darkness I could imagine , and this was too great a price to pay for the rough fondle of an ensweatered breast ? the going token of affection at the time . I nodded rudely to the mourners as I went outside to take in great gulps of air , and I did not turn back when I heard Tina calling me . There were of course those other girls , demented atrocities who lay impassively in boiler rooms , behind schoolyard handball walls , or in the sand traps of the nearby golf course while a group of us would swagger our way through a gangbang ; but while these events helped me to adjust to a more mature female anatomy , my retarded place in the line and the catatonic expression on these girls ' faces usually made me retire after a few soft , unpenetrating efforts . NO , THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a professional . Her name was Jane Polanski . How old she was , I can not remem ? ber , except that to me , then , she appeared well along into adult blossom . She was large , blond , full-breasted , with a quiet , open face that betokened resignation rather than any deep passion . When I met her , she was wearing a blue satin dress slit to the thighs and , with her co-workers , was leaning stoically over the guardrail which encircled a near-empty dance floor . She was a hostess in the Samba Palace , one of those benighted dance halls and places of rendezvous along Broadway , and I , flush with Christmas money . was in from the sticks of Jackson Heights looking for big-city thrills . We danced , I bought her Coca-Colas at a dollar a glass and cigarettes at a dollar a package . With a pleasant tenacity which consisted of a grind or two while we danced and some whispered obscenities while we were at table , she coaxed me to such extravagance that , in less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from between her breasts to make it appear that she had hought out Radio City Music Hall for the evening . Our first meeting ended with my having just enough money left to uncheck my overcoat and command a subway home . But I also took with me a promise that the next time we met , if I could arrive nearer to the four o'clock closing time with thirty-five dollars , there would he rewards greater than abdominal bumps to a fox-trot tempo . I looked into her bored . ingenuous Mitteleuropa face , ; a face transmitting the features of generations of one-night stands in taverns along the roads between Prague , Warsaw , and Budapest , and , though I really had no choice , I trusted her . A few days later , this confidence was rewarded . Jane , smelling of powder and a strong , peppermint perfume , gave me a mediocre launching into manhood in the sadly furnished rented room of a two-family house oddly enough just a few blocks from where I lived at the time . I say mediocre perhaps unjustly : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of curious investigations and helping me without laughter or condescension through the choreography of an honest , above-hoard screw . There was not much excitement in her , however , for she claimed the subway ride had tired her out and that she 'd been unusually mangled and trod upon by the night 's customers . Dumbly , l had had to wait while , for twenty minutes , she rubbed and soaked her swollen feet , and maintained a grim silence broken only by heavy , working-class sighs . Nevertheless , I remember afterwards walking the streets at dawn , the first time I had ever been up at that hour without sleep , happily inhaling the female odors which still clung to my clothes . In terms of pleasures , depressions , horrors , and delights , I was confused , but I did feel keenly satisfied with myself , as though I 'd fulfilled one more condition of proof that I could indeed exist in the larger world of heroes and exploits , the world through which I planned one day to tear like a demonic . Asian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sieges I was planning , and I was still grateful to her when , a decade later , long after I 'd had years of furious and inconclusive battling behind me , and long after Jane had taken her bovine hustle away from the Samba Palace , I saw her picture still festooning its entrance , fixing her as she was in 1949 , in a broad-shouldered gown , a rosebud mouth , and a rush of curly , blond hair spilling well over her shoulders . The photograph gave prominence to the list breasts I had actually fondled at leisure , and , passing by , now a sexual veteran . I would look at them warmly , wonder at the rush of time , and salute their honest , hardworking proletarian owner . Many followed Jane . but , as I said , with gambling . my play with whores swelled to the extent of tri-weekly orgies occasioned by an early-morning wish to tear open the sheath of tension which the night 's play had wrapped around me . But there were deeper reasons too , reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment from the unremitting data of wins and losses , from the precise addition of my self 's worth of an evening , from the ritualized sayings , grumbles , and exultations of other gamblers : in short , to dip for a moment into a weaker . more ill-defined , more human world which did not demand that one 's secrets be turned up continually , which allowed pretensions to replace calculations , which encouraged foolishness , illusion , and the sort of grand , tawdry lies that one creates for strangers while on vacation . These 5:00 A.M. treks were brief holidays from the austere pleasures which defined all that I had discovered important about myself . If I had behaved and worked well , if I had riot suffered a numbing loss , then I might indulge my frailties with a short , secular tour through the environs of Forty-second Street , gathering up two or three hookers desperate for some rewarding score before the day 's commuters erupted from the subways and stifled , with morning papers and Nedick 's orange juice , the nighttime atmosphere of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift , as expansive as a Midwestern conventioneer , offering more money than the girls would probably make in three nights of ordinary , moody , suspicious tricks , insinuating , in an overexcited babble , that I had strange desires , and that together we could hold back the sun , have a bat rnasqu ? , make a swinging scene . " You a cop ? " was generally their first response a never did understand why they considered exuberance and hyperbole attributes of the vice squad ) and at this I would then tone myself down and return to the enticing business of money . Soon I would have their dark faces showing that tiny bit of trust which was all these ladies needed to make them risk thirty days in the women 's detention house or disembowelment at the hands of some sexual extremist . Finally , we would be off to my apartment , and the early mornings were full of music and the cackles of Geraldines , Gigis , Ronnies. and Bobbies as , under my command , they scuffled about the living room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the while , trying earnestly to match my whims , vying with each other for personal attention which might call for an extra tip . " What you see in that Gigi ? " Ronnie would say . She got a black , ugly face that look like forty mile uh bad road . " " Hey , Jack , " Ronnie whispers , " that Gigi ai n't gon na give you nothin ' . She ai n't got the chops fur what you want . Now I got an ass on me like uh Mississippi mule . You can bang away till you get tired . " And now Geraldine insinuates herself while feigning a search for a glass in my kitchen : " Sheet , we can make somcthin ' happen , baby , you git rid of them two dragass whores . I know the kinda scene you looking for . You want to have it all your way , do n't y cu . Colonel ? That 's cool with me . " It was high court intrigue , but I generally kept them serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottoms pointing skywards to receive my restrained promptings , they paraded proudly as I tried to draw the folds of my mind further and further apart so that any new , happy excess might easily violate it . It was as if I wanted to parody carnal pleasure , to make of it some grotesque , comical Sancho next to the quixotic exultations of my gambling . It was a burlesque orgy , in which , by no means oblivious , in these times of riots and Third World emergings , to the historical moment , I let my pale , flaccid body rise like a fetish from the swarm of blackness at its feet . At times I wanted these dark women to rise up , rip , flay , and quarter me ; but then I would remember that I , too , still had a small coal of desire worth fanning with a little more breath , the desire to catch my fate in some sparkling baroque casino and finally to be , like the civilization for which no white body stood surrogate , remembered for daring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the mornin saturnalias never lasted for more than an hour . simply could not sustain them . Something alway would break into the mood , some moment of al perceptive intolerance would snatch the joy frog the game and I would be left with the simple straightforward business of achieving a quick , tepi coming in the midsts of an ebony flurry of breast and thighs . Sometimes the end of the imaginativ play would be caused by a book set out upon th coffee table , a book which would remind me that , at ter all . I had a sobering intelligence ; sometimes i would be an unreal and unexpected flash of mysel in the reflection of a mirror : sometimes my gum would simply start to bleed : and often it was m : downstairs neighbor , a professor of art history at girls ' college in New York , who would call pleadim for rest before he rose to go and explain the sig nifieance of Merovingian ornaments to his students Whatever the pall , the girls sensed it immediately and while one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be hastily elimbim into their shreds of underwear , straightening thei wigs , adjusting seams and eyelashes . and in femah ways preparing to meet an East Side morning be tween Fifth and Madison Avenues ? for them , no the easiest of confrontations . And then they were gone . " A yani pear de mouri , lorsque je couche seal , " said Nfallarme , excusing a late night preoccupation with whores or poetry With me , au contraire , I would be certain of dead if the Gigis , Geraldines , or any other stranger wanted to stretch out beside me and share the in timacies of sleep , intimacies which I find muc more personal than any sexual exchanges . Nothing I believe , so splinters the self as a bed shared w itl an unknown body . To hear , on the verge of un consciousness , alien sighs . scratches , and groan : makes me spiral past the doubts of Descartes am suspect that my very thoughts are not mine . I fee then that there is on substance to me at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is per manent , impersonal , and inclusive . Therefore , if have one area of brute , visceral discrimination , i is in the care with which I try to select someone o trusted quality and compassion to doze next to someone who will let me move into dreams with m. secrets hoarded together for my own selfish sleep No , I was never sorry to see the whores depart A fresh silence would slip into my rooms and would feel , left alone , peculiarly comfortable wit ) the idiosyncracies of the last night . There was , o course , now and then a small spasm of fear as I go into bed , fear that , with the frenzies of gamblin ; and my high-spirited black whores , I had broke : irrevocably from the comfortable orbit of a rations life . And then , too , there would be a whiff of edu cated anxiety over the gambles , over the narrativ which I planned around myself and which I watcher each day unfold with design and drama . Still , m life had now become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sighing Cavalier poet pleased with his own sensibility , I would go off to sleep hanging in a sort of sweet agony between postcoital depression and post-Copernican despair . 13 UT NOW , IN LAS VEGAS , a three-thousand-dollar .011 victory tucked into a mound of socks in my suitcase . I felt little need of the morning bacchanals that had calmed me in New York . I had begun my journey , the first trial had been passed , and if I had asked the Bell Captain ? the sweet , respectful smile he gave me ! ? for a woman , it was really only a deprecation of any godlike feelings , a little indication of human weariness lest there should he some cold , vengeful jealousy in the heavens . A soft bossa nova bounced off my room 's pastel walls , ice tinkled gloriously in my glass , my body luxuriated in the silk robe that covered it , and . from my window , I looked down upon the Strip , watching cars flash by beneath the colossal lights of the hotels which , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American desert in the sky ? Sands , Dunes. , Golden Nugget ? names in mammoth swirls of neon , planned to burn away any natural darkness from the city limits . I saluted all that I could see with a sip from my glass , and-then my doorbell , an octave-spaced chime of two notes , rang . " If there is a blemish wrong about her , " 1 thought , " I 'll pay up and send her away . Everything 's too perfect now to endure a badly turned breast or a moustached upper lip . " I opened the door and the evening continued a triumph . There . in the portal , was a blond creature of about eighteen , with a face as lasciviously drowsy as a Balthus child 's . She was all golden , in a yellow dress , wearing yellow shoes , and , most touching of all , carrying a tiny , yellow purse . With refrigerated blue eyes , she took a quick , knowing estimate of me and then smiled at the happy simplicity ahe must have caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' a party all by yourself , " she said in a sharp metallic drawl . I had heard those twanging sounds before , long ago , in the ' Army . during the stretched-out , tortuous days at Camp Chaffee , Arkansas . " You 're an Arkansan ? " I asked , as she glanced around the room to make certain that we were to be d deux . " Close , " she said , frowning a bit , probably over the fact that I had anticipated part of her standard conversational give-and-take . As a rule , whores ask questions , and seem generally perplexed or uninterested when . in return , a little social interrogation is required of them , " I 'm from Oklahoma . " she added finally , and then , with a proper crossing of legs , sat down daintily in one of the chairs , " Fort Sill , right on the border . I 've been in Arkansas a lot . " From the Arkansas-Oklahoma border to Las Vegas ? the route of escape . She must have realized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an my hustler and had moved on ? here , to the air ? r conditioned refinement of a gambler 's suite , I " 11 thought of those I had seen like her around Army hales , young wives scuffing along vacantly in slacks and wedgies , their hair eternally condemned to curlers , pushing prams and shopping carts about the PX , young girls already puffed of face from matching their noncommissioned husbands ' drinking habits , girls always smoking , chattering , and pulling a hazy , transient life together which had begun on a three-day pass spent in the boozy wonder of a motel and which had now become a regulated boredom prescribed by Pentagon regulations , I thought of those girls , how they stiffened sullenly whenever an officer 's wife glided by them in the commissary , and I was glad this little whore had run to Las Vegas . Now she was settling into the room , slowly , obviously getting ready for some humanizing talk before discussing bed and board . I went to make us a drink , and from the angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Exquisite ! Pert , compact , with fierce little breasts and slim , round calves and thighs . 1 have mentioned Balthus. and her face did have his charming insinuation of evil running through its baby features , but the more I stared , the more Crivelli came to mind . Crivelli of the golden madonna caught in a frame of peacocks and heavy , ripe , ebullient fruit . But finally she was very much my Lady of America ? half Oklahoma Gothic , half Las Vegas voluptuousness . The evening had been a series of dizzying successes and now , at its end , this radiant Oklahoman came to make me toss reflections and memories about in my own mental time . It was all a new landscape with a peculiar geometry that did not seem to need the elaborate theorems that had bound my old being together into a cramped , suspicious figure whose sides were raw boundaries that shrank from any rough . unmanageable experience . So often 1 had felt that , with my cautious , weak , fastidious sensibility , I must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , expansive enjoyment . But now , suddenly . I could shuffle the planes of my being around like cards , putting memory and future on the line each time a heavy bet was made , existing , for all my respect for the forms of chance , without a system . I felt now as if each sharp experience had no gloomy antecedents , no haunting similarities which could haul the phenomena in front of me back into cautious pockets of memory where old pains and failures would siphon the exuberance nut of them . Standing in my room , I felt , occurring slowly beneath my bathrobe , an ecdysis of old flesh that had grown rough . scaly , dry , and impenetrable with use . I knew the feeling would not last long , but 1 enjoyed it , enjoyed falling instantly in love with the little patch of Oklahoma sunlight sitting so ladylike on my chair , and I considered that this , too , I had won at the baccarat table , that it was all part of a series which I might follow to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sally . What 's yours ? " I told the truth . Usually , at this moment , at this 85 question , I would fall into glorious lies . " Winfield Scott , " " Sebastian David , " " Johnny Laredo " ? these had been some of my aliases stretching back to the Samba Palace , a pseudonymous trail of caution , suspicion , nominal discontent , and cinema romance . But now I spoke my proper name out clearly . " From the way you 're flyin ' around here , it looks like you won some money tonight . " Pride and economic discretion did a brief battle within me . " Yes , I won . " " Hey , that 's real nice now . " Sally laughed , squirming out of the chair and beginning an excited march around the room . " The trouble always comes from losers who feel that now the town owes them something free . They want to bitch the price with me an ' I do n't like bitchin ' . The old men arc the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits . Have n't seen it in ten years and then want me to get it up fer ' ern in ten seconds . Then they still bitch about the price . " Her complaint , I admit , was crude , but I loved the serious outrage and tone with which it was delivered . She rambled on about the vagaries and trials of her business , and I did nothing more than nod sympathetically from a stretched-out position on the bed . Years of difficulties with lovely girls of simple , direct natures like Sally 's had taught me that there is something about my style of conversation which upsets them , something that makes them draw back coolly from my metaphors and turns of phrase as if there were mad , obscene images hidden among them . I generally consoled myself by assuming that any form of figurative language must seem a mode of insanity to the semiliterate , but this was poor comfort when , after having burst out with a rich , imaginative paragraph , I found myself being written off simply as another creep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiles coming from Sally , and so I avoided as much as possible the dangers of language , mumbling only an agreement here and there to punctuate her list of complaints . Then , finally , came a silence , the traditional little interim that always hangs between the amenities of a first-class hooker and the moment of business . She was standing at the foot of the bed , staring down at me , her arms in a determined fold . " Well , what did you have in mind , Jack ? " " Was waist du , Schatz ? Qu'est-ce que to veux , cheri ? iQue deseas , querido ? " I had certainly heard the question before , in rooms over the Trocadero in Frankfurt as a soldier , in the tiny functional hotels off Place Clichy , in the cribs of the zonas rojas in Mexico , and on and on to wherever I could pack my desires . And it was a question I could never really answer , for when asked for an honest confession of my wishes , a mushroom cloud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud made up of indistinct formless gyrations of flesh that refused to shape into a specific answer . Whores had long since taught me that what I considered to be my black secrets of carnal excess were , in fact , tired commonplaces easily categorized for fast and simple dis patch , and it was not therefore any clinical embar rassment which clogged my mind . Perhaps the ques tion was too much for my imagination to hold for simple answer , since , so often , from the base of mi mind , I would hear a rumbling , inarticulate re sponse which called darkly on these ladies to ob literate me with pleasure , and there is no precise ex pression for this except a dryly spoken " everything . ' " Everything ? " Sally frowned . " What does tha mean ? " I sensed a fissure creeping through our rapport and I answered with a weak , inconclusive gesture of my hand . " All I do is straight and French , " Sally said , het voice now a little wary but , to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will be as straight as you desire And if you want to exalt the French by giving then exclusive synonymity with oral tricks , caprices , anc delights , I will not chauvinistically protest . Tonigh T have won so much that an idyllic , rather than dramatic , lay will suffice . " That 's fine , " I said . " That 's all I do too ; that ' : all I ever do . " Sally nodded understandingly . " But , " she said " we 've got something to discuss first . " I nodded . Let us speak the numbers and get over with . " A hundred dollars . " rrIHE FIGURE STUNNED ME . No matter how time of I wars or the moods of commerce inflate , devalue or make other economic rearrangements with cur. rency , " one hundred " will always have for me ar impressive and intimidating substance to it . " One hundred " ? when I was growing up , this was what was needed , as a weekly wage , to be rich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heights to one of the marvelous towers that sprouted arra ? gantly across the river . Faced with a hundred-dollar expense , I always have to remind myself that the financial game has changed and that the once for . midable figure of depression psychology has beer emasculated into a simple arithmetical unit with nc extraordinary social panache . " A hundred dollars ? That for the night ? " " No , Jack , you know better than that . This Vegas . It 's a hundred a pop . " I wanted to celebrate and felt loose and prepotent Indeed , mulling over Sally 's attributes , I had reek . oned on between three and four nicely spaced pop : before dawn . But to spend a tenth of my winnings on these comings seemed prohibitive at even the most decadent rates of exchange . Fifty-dollar tip : to the croupiers were one thing , for that is part ni the ritual of winning and is expected , planned on and enjoyed . But to pay out a hundred dollars for each spasm ! I am not cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of a mediun necessary to the profoundest conditions of life . needed its ambience in which to breathe , swagger and hope . It was not that I wanted to do anything with it , any more than I wanted to do something with oxygen or sunlight ; it was simply that cast had become the element I needed for my personal evolution . Vestigial , lower-order desires occasionally made me squander a little of this precious substance , but a firm sense of self-preservation helped me recoil from indiscriminate popping at the prices Sally quoted , and so I stayed silent , forcing her to present some economic alternatives . " If you 're going to be here awhile , " she said , " we could work out somethin ' so I stay with you . You know , go to dinner and the shows and all . " With the meter running all the while ? I thought . Hardly . I wanted to leave the subject , make the arrangement , keep the enchantment of the night galloping along . I had already , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's beauty : her hair , while pretending to a straight , loose , Alice-inWonderland fall to her shoulders ; had been frozen by some evil spray into an unhuman rigidity . When she nodded , hair and head moved all of a piece . If this bargaining continued , I felt more flaws might leap forward at any moment . On the table next to me was my wallet . From it , I took a hundred-dollar bill and presented it to Sally , indicating which of her buying plans had interested me . I expected her to look disappointed . but somewhere she had learned to keep her expectations at a minimum , and , without fuss , she snapped the money into her purse , sent me a naughty reproach with her eyes when 1 groped for her , and went off : o the bathroom to prepare her pre-coital toilet . I stretched out on the bed and waited . This was an interim which I had grown used to since the ad-went of intimate hygiene and devilish gadgets to . yard off conception . One no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there to have her in a twirl of unconsidered passion . No , now , at the nace nent when Molly Bloom said " yes , " at the instant shell the dark declivities are moist and ready , there : omes a whispered entreaty for patience and the wavy clump of footsteps in the darkness as the lady lips away to her vaginal laboratory . It is a dare ; erous moment , for you are left alone with your agging erectile tissue and rising doubts as to whether the coming tumble will be worth the long lours of conversation which preceded it and the iecessary babble of tenderness that will come after . ndeed , you start to wonder if it is all worth even he effort of taking off and putting on clothes in a trange surrounding , and when this is pondered , ? mobileg peculiar inevitably happens : there is a ealization , as you see your body rising evenly with ach breath and stretched out , white and vulnerable , a the darkness , that all has been abruptly reversed , at he who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , been teased into a trap , and that ie muffled , female toilet sounds betoken a coming ite in which you will play an ignominious role . At - as moment , you think of yourself as , at best , a esh-and-blood dildoe , and , at worst , as an exendable tribesman spread out beneath a priest 's bsidian knife . Sally was back before I slipped too deeply into these reflections , and with her she carried the limply of the moment : two enormous pool towels one compact , inviting muscle , a dimpled hardness made for quick . sensual reflexes . She set the towels aside and , after a quick check for any inflamation of the genital tract , began to wipe and massage my groin with the warm , damp , pink , and initialed washcloth . This was a professional prologue that I had once found nettling , but I had , years ago , during my days in the Army , used my imagination to color and soften the clinical mood of the scene : Lieutenant Richardson , suffering from a vicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but still held together as if by a virile art of will , being ministered to by Nurse Sally , virgin , but with a woman 's inborn acceptance of the raw physicalities of life , who will attend the bloodied shreds of my glory until they are whole , healthy , and capable of offering her a gratitude which she will blushingly accept . Finally , I am clean and pure enough for us to begin . Sally lowers lights and music and curls about me , angling herself to fulfill the Gallic part of our agreement . Then , a pleasant wave swings through my body , and I place my head snugly between her calves , close my eyes , and reflect on the good fortune that was coaxing me out again into the world . For this entwinement with Sally I considered just a piquant foretaste of all the robust joys I might finally have if I could , through gambling , break out once and for all from the old , labyrinthine encasement about myself in which I had so long scurried , fretfully looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the large spectacles of life , spectacles which , as though from a sickroom window , I saw rushing by me daily . Occasionally , I would stumble out of this personal maze . waving , for attention , a few written words for which I claimed magic powers , but I never felt that this proved me anything more than an adequate confidence man out in the world , someone without a real passport to a clear existence , someone holding out a badly forged , wine-blotched visa in the hope that he might cross the borders of his own totalitarian solitude . And so soon I would be hack among the twists and writs of my own devising , pretending that I really cherished my aloneness . After all . I would argue , my agonies , my deceits , my bafflements have strung out these corridors , and it is actually comforting to see the old scratches on the walls , the old signposts to myself , the graffiti of memory , which , deciphered over and over again . can make one feel that the interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no need for crowns , medals , and the usual glitter of public homage . And so more and more I sat in my medieval maze , crying " sanctuary " to myself so that I might forget that nothing of real importance or danger was pursuing me . But , at last , I had grown disgusted with this refuge and tired of holding myself back from an open adventure with the world . In the end . I had admitted that I could not create my fate out of even the most clever , self-absorbed ruminations . To live as I honestly wanted to meant being in consort with a destiny that would come at me from some external , unsuspected source , and because I had grown impatient waiting for this collision , I had become a gambler , for I trusted that standing at the center of chance , inviting a clear encounter day after day , might finally bring on a meeting with myself which would let me know how deep a mark I was meant to leave on everything around roe . For , obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambling , no matter how complete I felt this existence within dramatic probability to hc , my final goal was the ancient one of worldly goods and spiritual acclamation . ND NOW THERE WAS ONE SMALL WORLDLY GOOD entwined around me . Objectively , of course , I knew that we were whore and diem . at best two contiguous bits of solitude ; but l hod won three thousand dollars ? the sound of that number , its long vowel and fierce diphthong rang a delight through me each time I spoke it to myself ? and , on command , Sally had appeared and brought her sensual light into my bed . She may not have meant gold , grace , and an earthly kingdom , but she was a scratching at my outer wall , a whisper inviting me to stay with my quest . " You go . your mind on business , Jack ? " Sally asked suddenly . " I 'm not gettin ' much action down here . " " What do you do , Sally , " I asked , " when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " What ? " " I mean , what do you think of ? " Sally laughed a little . " I do n't think of anything . If there 's a mirror near by , I make faces at myself . You know , I cross my eyes and puff out my cheeks , things like that . Just to remind me what a fool I 'm diddlin ' with . " " And , " I asked slowly , " were you making faces just now ? " Sally seemed really hurt . " Was that how it was coming through to you ? Maybe I 'm no good at it then , maybe I 'm no good at ail . " " No , " I consoled her , you were fine . I was just wondering a little , that 's all . " " Well , stop wondering and put your mind to things . I would n't never make any faces with you . " I smiled and gently palmed her head , forcing it back down to its agreeable duties . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a slow , self-satisfied way , it still was meandering . Sally , for all her charm , did not help to fix my attention on the moment , for she had one of those abstractly beautiful bodies , bodies without particular twists or markings , which , when scanned leisurely , recall to me all the past pleasures that I 've drawn from female recesses in general . I thought then , or perhaps now with Sally 's flanks lighting up my mind , back to my first hooker , back to solemn , placid Jane who had once , with the enthusiasm of a peasant kneeling to pray , done to me in her furnished Jackson neigh room what Sally was now doing above the IA Vegas desert . ( First love , first kiss , first fellatio the times change and the styles of growing up wit them . ) Jane , too , had referred to this act as " doing French " and had added that only because I wr young and clean was she offering me this speci favor . I am still grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and me , a trio ever youn ; ever clean , and ever American , a trio off on wicked holiday among alien perversions . Tu per fait un bon pompier , Sally . Et toi aussi , Jane , sais comment faire an bon pipe . Let us hide in ti language of those you believed responsible for ti advent of such rough deeds . And now into this erotic calm a memory of rz mother , a woman more worldly in her imagining than either Jane or Sally . It is the day after n Polish conquest and I see her appearing with tl pants I had worn the night before draped over in arms . Before exploding in , she had obviously s , her face in a reproachful grimace , but there V4 ' too much merriment around her mouth and eyr to be caged in by affected seriousness . I knew tlexpression well : it meant that I had done somethin which demanded a conventional maternal conden nation , but over which her imagination was secret pleased . For an eternal minute she stood over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ r arid thumb , relishing , with her blue , gleaming eye my uneasiness . " What on earth is this , Jackie ? " she asked finall : and her smile insinuated that she knew everythin and that she just wanted to he , as she was in s much else , the first sharer of my secrets . But t1-. pants ? What had the pants to do with anything I stared and stared at them , but could find n damning evidence of debauch until , suddenly , alon the inside lining of the fly , I glimpsed blotches lipstick , shameless , rose-colored smudges that fa the entire length of the zipper . I cursed Jane 's slope manners and pretended to see nothing . " What do you mean what is this ? " I asked , lool ing intensely at the crotch of my pants . " I don see anything . " I had always been frank with in mother about my early sexual discoveries and shy in a certain Byronic way , had always been so wit me . She , not my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , using phrases like " and then body trembles , " " fluid explodes out of you , " " yo tingle with a sense of pleasure and life . " But seemed a long way from these refulgent images I Jane 's cosmetic smears along the inner lining of pair of Botany pants . " Jackie , Jackie , Jackie " ? three long sighs of b , mused exasperation , as if I had again gone an provided her with an example of my marvelou genius-indicating specialness ? " I knew what th lipstick means . Now tell me , and be honest , did th. come off any of the girls I know ? " Now it was my turn to tease , to keep her su pended . I mumbled , muttered , pretended embarras ment and ignorance ; she smiled , sighed , flutter ( the pants nervously and pleaded now for frankne : between us . Then , just as we reached a hysterical pitch in our playing , I began to blurt the story out . Halfway through the details , I realized I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and amusement dissolved from my mother 's face and were replaced by a sour anger , a resentful , pinched disappointment . " You paid this woman , Jackie ? " As soon as this had been icily said , I knew what was wrong . Once , several years before , I had come home front a birthday party in delirious contentment and informed her that the acknowledged beauty of the class had chosen me as her partner for a bout of necking in a bedroom closet . My triumph was met with stiff , injured pride , and then I was curtly told that she was actually sickened by how obviously little I thought of myself . Her son should not be set off into spins of unbumptious wonder because he had soul-kissed a twelve-year-old . On the contrary , I was the one who had performed the favor , and what she expected to see in the future was the cool smile of someone who is certain that , for him , women were disposable packages of enjoyment . My cretinous smile was a breach of the rakehell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a betrayal of the profile she had bequeathed me ? the long , angular , nervous profile which she insisted was aristocratic . After that event , she had sulked for days , letting drop acid prophecies that I would , with my excessive humility . end up marrying the janitor 's daughter ? a fat , myopic creature with Mongoloid features and no saliva control ? the first time she wetly grinned at me . But now , of course , what I had done was infinitely worse . I had paid money for what was , in my mother 's mind , a divine right . I had not seduced , ! had not been a gay magnet who , by simple nature , Irew to it trembling female bodies . No , I had paid , Said like any clod out on a Saturday night . It was .00 much for her . She let the pants slip disdainfully o the floor , rose from the bed , and stared down at ne with eyes filled with grief . My mother often ried when reality disappointed her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you .. you take those pants to he . ; leaned , Jackie , I want nothing more to do with hem . " I tried to protest . but she would have none of it . " No ... no " ? she was looking past me , at some ision which sustained her in such bad moments ? let 's drop this subject . I 'm going in now to take own the Christmas tree . It 's time . The needles are eginning to fall . Yes , it 's time to take it down . " I was desperate . To leave it at this would mean ionths of such wistfulness , months of living with er disappointment . I tried one last defense . " But an Gogh went to prostitutes , " I said . " You know e did . We read about it together . " At the time , he as my mother 's favorite painter , the very symbol f art and imagination . Reading to me from a poputr biography of the Dutchman , she would stop and tarvel over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had come to understand that he was art of that vision she saw whenever our small Jackson Heights apartment became too oppressive . For a moment , I thought I had hit the mark . l saw her waver , stitching her emotions together carefully . But then , just as she left the room : " Van Gogh was tormented , Jackie . Are you tormented ? " She closed the door and I was alone . " Tormented " ? my mother had spoken the word dreamily , as though to achieve the state it described meant some profound absolution from all human grossness . I pondered and stared at the objects spread about my room ? a small desk , two homemade bookcases , a heavy , red leather dub chair passed on to me by a dead uncle , two lithographs depicting London markets at the time of Mayhew . Everything seemed flat , ordinary , and comfortable , definitely not the paraphernalia of torment . But there were times at night , in a brief , waking intermission between dreams , when my things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear that had startled me awake . Tormented ? I might be , I thought . I might honestly be . And even if I was n't , I decided then , with a feeling of relief and freedom , that I could become so if it meant inspiring my mother and excusing the whims I had about the way wished to live . God , yes ? for I was already planning other visits to Jane ? I could make myself tormented . SO ALLY STOPPED AND GLANCED RACK over her shoulder . Like a child with no one to play with , she was frowning moodily . " I 'm wastin ' my time , " she chided . I felt very foolish , for I was letting the cap to the evening slip away into abstractions and memories , a process which had ruined a good part of my past life . " I love you , Sally , " I said loudly , and before she could undercut me with a hard , whorish riposte , I repeated the phrase three more times and then dove down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major and minor , I savored for the first time the ointment that she had put on minutes before . I could not believe the signals my taste buds sent to my brain , Strawberry ! A strawberry-flavored , genuine American piece of sexual confection . This was style , this was the sort of sybaritic pleasure 1 aspired to . it was more than human ; it was the ambrosial cunnilingus of the Olympians : it was the transformation that luck and fortune can make even of the flesh . And Sally and I made love , neatly and classically , within the categories of our contract . The shade of my mother may have sighed moodily , for , after nearly twenty years , I was still lying among whores , paying ( two pops ' worth it would prove to be ) like a low-bred salesman for a little action on the road . Still , her specter may have fluttered with some pride over the cool quality of the moment and the fact that her son had gambled his way into it . At least , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 had my necessary torments and that , to propitiate our old visions , I was still trying to be exceptional .
