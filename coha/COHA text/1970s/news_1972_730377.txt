txt California has so many burglaries , it is spending $2.5 million to get rid of them . State officials have launched an anti-burglary drive which they say is the first in the nation to use federal funds in an attempt to fight a specific crime in a specific area . California 's Law Enforcement Assistance Administration agency is spending the $2.5 million this year ? of its total budget of $42 million ? to try to stop burglaries in parts of Oakland , San Francisco , Los Angeles , San Diego , and Orange and Los Angeles Counties . Burglary is such a major problem in the Golden State that Attorney General Evelle E. Younger has referred to California as the burglary capital of the world . Nationally , the vast bulk of LEAA funds , which total $840 million in the current fiscal year , are still being spent for projects which LEAA national director Jerris Leonard at ajmeeting here called " tinkering with the system of criminal justice . " // *California zeroes in on burglary // Examples of such " tinkering " : California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bar to pay for the third year of its public school educational program called , " Law in b . Free Society . " The bar program is to " Continue development , implementation , and evaluation of educational programs regarding law and legal and political systems in California . " The state has also allocated $2 million of its LEAA shared-revenues to continue Ideveloping a computerized criminal justice information system . Another example cited as the usual , direct approach of LEAA projects to cri fighting is the California grant of $1.5 m n this year to the California Youth Authority to develop systems of " identifying and classifying drug abuse wards and relevant treatment resources and approaches . " Critics contend such projects produce no measurable results . But in the first three months of California 's ? burglary project , burglary rates have been cut by 30 percent in Bellflower , a suburb of Los Angeles , Mr. Lawson says , and by 47 percent in the notorious Mission district of San Francisco . Mr. Lawson emphasizes , though , that these are just preliminary results , comparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too soon to predict long-range success . ' Tinkering ' de-emphasized In his Boston speech last week before the annual conference of LEAA state administrators , Mr. Leonard emphasized that such projects designed specifically to cut crime will be the new thrust of LEAA . The days of " tinkering " with the criminal justice system are gone , Mr. Leonard told the delegates . LEAA was finally " on target , " he added , and " that target is crime . " But LEAA officials say it will take until mid-1973 for states to shift from spending crime-fighting money to such projects as the California anti-burglary project . In San Francisco , police are using LEAA funds for stepped-up underpover surveillance of known fences of stolen goods and known burglars . Los Angeles County Sheriff Peter J. Pitchess is taking the approach of inspecting homes and businesses to make them harder to break into . Many doors inspected Using deputies , Sheriff eitcness ruts inspected some 20,000 homes and 3,0 ' 00 businesses in Bellflower , pointing out security weaknesses to owners . Many locks , he has found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sheriff Pitchess has also opened an information center , displaying the types of door and window locks that make it tougher for burglars to get in . And the LE AA agency has prepared an information booklet giving owners tips on how to protect their homes . Most burglaries are committed by amateurs , Robert H. Lawson , director of California 's LEAA program , points out . A professional burglar can always break in , he says . But an amateur will usually pass up a home if it takes too long to get in and and try somewhere else . As evidence , Mr. Lawson says that where security improvements have been made in Bellflower hares , only one has been successfully broken into and four other attempts failed . Are burglars merely passing up Bellflower and hitting other surrounding towns that much harder ? Mr. Lawson says that burglary rates in nearby towns have risen only 1 to 3 percent since the Bellflower project began . Insurance break sought Mr. Lawson says his agency now is trying to get insurance companies to lower burglary insurance premiums on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security . The LEAA officials says that this program has been so successful that Virginia has devloped a similar program with his help and that other states , such as Indiana and Kentucky , are showing a tremendous interest in the California project . " Burglary is one crime we can do something about , " Mr. Lawson ? says . " We are using only tried and true techniques , nothing new , " he adds . " The only thing new is getting those techniques all together . California spends $1.3 billion a year on its criminal justice system ; courts , police , prisons , and prosecution , Mr. Lawson says . The $2.5 million , one-year experiment in fighting burglary is designed to show local police departments what they can accomplish by better use of their money and men , he says .
