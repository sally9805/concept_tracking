Minutes later , as the spectators , most of them students , were boarding buses , the winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mendelson. were very orderly leaving thi tent . I know how people car panic when a big tent like that starts whipping around . " Even the animals took it all right . They got a little jumpy but their handlers calmed them down .
