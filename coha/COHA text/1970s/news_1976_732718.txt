txt As Jimmy Carter waves to the receding crowd from the back platform of his campaign special he wants to leave the message , " I 'm not a radical ; I 'm a substantial person . " Harry S Truman , in the most famous whistle-stop trip of all against Gov . Thomas E. Dewey in 1948 , lambasted the " no good , do-nothing 80th Congress . " Reporters in 1948 scribbled their story against the dusty side of the " Ferdinand Magellan " from whose rear platform President Truman has just introduced " the Boss " ( Mrs. Truman ) and the " person who bosses her " ( radiant Margaret Truman ) ? and then tossed their hasty copy to Western Union messenger boys like throwing fish to a gull . Now comes Governor Carter , 28 years later , addressing nine rallies from a departure ceremony at New York 's Penn Station at 7:33 Monday morning ( Sept. 20 ) to Pittsburgh at 10:15 the same night . Vice-presidential candidate Walter Mondale carries on the trip Tuesday with six stops between Pittsburgh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan primary fight last May revived the whistle-stop technique , which has intimacy and immediacy as the candidate comes down from the rear platform , as the bands play , the dogs bark , the children cry , and the opposite water tower echoes his words and carries on a kind of running dialogue with him . Harry Truman knew it , and Franklin D. Roosevelt before him . The barnstorming tradition , in fact , goes back to " Tippecanoe and Tyler , too " when candidates campaigned more leisurely in coaches // From page 1 *Carter 's whistle-stop aim and trains instead of darting about in airplanes in the modern manner . Jimmy Carter wants to be down-to-earth in two senses , it appears ; he wants to try to drive home one big theme : he 's not a fuzzy-edged do-gooder advocating plans costing billions without counting the cost . He wants to present himself ? as he did in an hour-long weekend interview with the Associated Press and will again at his confrontation with President Ford on Thursday ? as an experienced executive . This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I think the debates , unless President Ford or I make a serious mistake , will probably solidify support . ... I think it would alleviate a lot of the concerns about me . President Ford is much better known than I am . And I think the juxtaposition ... will accrue to my own benefit , if I do a good job in the debates ? which I intend to do . " Republicans charged over the weekend that Carter proposals for comprehensive tax overhaul " would raise taxes for about half the American families . ... People who have a higher income would pay more taxes at a certain level , " he said . " ... What are you thinking of as higher ? " he was asked . " I do n't know , " Mr. Carter replied . " I would Lake the mean or median level of income and anything above that would be higher ' and anything below that would be lower . " But when pressed to state specifically the median income level above which he would increase taxes , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer that question because I have n't gone into it . I do n't know how to write the tax code now in specific terms . It is just not possible to do that on a campaign trail . " Republicans also charge that Mr. Carter 's varied health and welfare programs would cost $100 billion . The Democrat hopes to bring unemployment down from 7.9 percent to 4.5 percent . with a balanced budget by 1980 . He is counting . apparently . on the " fiscal dividend " ? the normal . growth of America 's economy ? plus the equation that every 1 percent drop in unemployment saves the Treasury $2 billion in reduced welfare and unemployment insurance payments plus another $14 billion in increased tax revenues . " So that is where the money comes from , " Mr. Carter told interviewers . " It is from increased national growth and increased federal revenues and reduced payments for welfare and unemployment compensation . " Jimmy Carter who will debate President Ford on Thursday , was scheduled for whistle-stop speeches in Newark , Trenton , Overbrook ( Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pittsburgh . And where did " whistle-stop campaigning " get its name ? In 1948 , Sen. Robert Taft denounced Harry Truman 's trip : " The President is black-guarding the Congress at every whistle stop in the country , " he cried . The Democratic National Committee gleefully sent telegrams to the mayors of 35 cities along the route of the 31.700 miles Mr. Truman covered ( making 350 speeches with as many as 16 in a day ) , asking if they considered themselves " whistle stops " ? " Seattle is not a whistlestop ! " roared back Mayor W. F. Devin in a typical reply . The name stuck .
