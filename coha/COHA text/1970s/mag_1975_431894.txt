 | THE MEDITATION GAME @# On the first day of Christmas , my alleged true love gave to me a silver pillbox . Infuriating .

Of all the mind trips I 've tried , the simplest and most astonishing is meditation ; simple , because it is simple , astonishing because it has produced a great service industry . And the McDonald 's of the meditation business is Transcen dental Meditation . The McDonald 's or maybe the Howard Johnson 's : a relatively low fixed price . a standard item , and increasing numbers of franchises or outlets . Like McDonald 's , TM suggests . " You deserve a break today , " in fact , you desrve two , twenty minutes in the morning and twenty minutes in the evening . TM has processed about half a million Americans , most of them in the last four or five years , and that gives it respectable size among service organizations . In one sense , TM is a pioneer . Indians have been bringing the Vedanta , or Hindu scripture here for almost a hundred years , but TM made a meditation technique work with an audience tha did n't want to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TM deserves its success , whit . has been spectacular . Transcendental Meditation comes from a g tleman called Maharishi Mahesh Yogi ? born M hesh Prasad Varma in 1918 in the Central Pro inces , father forest ranger , degree in physics fr Allahabad University in 1942 , says the official ography . Maharishi was on his way to becomi like other members of his caste , a merchant or clerk , and to having a marriage arranged for hi when he met one of the major religious leaders India : Swami Brahmanada Saraswati , the Jade  | guru Bhagwan Shankaracharya , and he became a disciple and spent thirteen and a half years with him . His assignment , given when it became time for the master to leave his body , was to find a simple form of meditation for everyone to practice . Maharishi spent two years in.a cave in the Himalayas and emerged with TM . ( Two years in a cave , for a religious Indian , is like two years at the Harvard Business School for a commercial banker . ) Maharishi seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world plan , talking to Indian businessmen . His instincts steered him in the direction of acceleration ; things moved faster in the West , so by 1960 he was setting up the International Meditation Society in London . Being pragmatic in nature , he was not afraid to use radio , television , and public relations ? an approach that , needless to say , did not go down well with the gurus left in India . By the late 1960s he had as followers the Beatles and Mia Farrow ; John Lennon once spent eight hours a day meditating with the Maharishi in the Himalayas . The bearded , giggly presence of the Maharishi became familiar on the talk shows : there was Maharishi on Johnny Carson . And that crested and passed . The Maharishi went on a nationwide tour with the Beach Boys , and nobody came . The tour had to be canceled , and it looked like TM was another one of those Sixties things , fading with the natural rhythms of time . Within a couple of years , the Maharishi was to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he spoke another wave was beginning to curl . When I signed up for TM , I had already been through a year of other trips that involved meditations , and my attitude was more that of an engieer taking apart somebody else 's widget ? well , is see how they do it . Unlike most of my TM assmates , I did not have a friend who had just done it , and also unlike my TM classmates , I had been through much of the literature of meditation . Our first lecture was in a university building . On the table in our room were glossy reprints of artides from Scientific American and the Wall Street ournal telling us how TM would fix us up , with color charts in them of stress relief . TM 's own literature was there also . Our instructor was a cleancut junior called Buzz , who wore a sports jacket and loafers , and who smiled a lot . The audience was naturally mostly students , but with a sprinkling of older people , for the TM lectures were adrtised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ med to me ? over a wide area . " Anybody can do this , " Buzz said , " no matter how d or how smart . As we meditate we become clearer , ou can do more , students get better grades , the mind does n't wander . TM rest is deeper than sleep . gets rid of really deep stresses . It helps your relanship with other people . You will get along better th your roommates . " What we would do , if we wanted to sign up , was to come to two lectures , and then be initiated on the weekend , and then one more lecture and one more weekend ? that 's all there was . " Previously , we had three states of consciousness , " Buzz said . " Waking , sleeping , and dreaming . This is the fourth state , cosmic and allinclusive . The mind is evolutionary , a blessing of the Creator , approaching the Infinite One " ? Buzz giggled a bit , and the audience got restless ? " but there 's nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in anything . And nothing to give up . " " Is this the same as yoga ? " somebody wanted to know . " No , all you do in TM is sit still , " Buzz said . " Yoga will give you a charley horse . Zen monks meditate for twenty-five years to get the same result TM will give you in two weeks . It 's different from concentration , and from contemplation . " TM , said Buzz , uses a sound . Different sounds match different people ? you and your roommate might not like the same music . A sound in the Vedic tradition is a mantra . Each of us would get his own mantra . Were all the mantras really individual ? They were , though there were far more people than mantras , since 20,000 people a month were signing up for TM . How do the instructors match the mantra to the individual ? I wanted to know . Buzz said you went to a teacher training course ? ten or twelve weeks ? and learned how to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . We would fill out a questionnaire , have an interview , and get our mantras . " Never , " Buzz said , " tell anybody your mantra . That will ruin the whole effect . " How come ? " We have found that through experience . Your mantra is secret . Every once in a while somebody goes through TM , and then a friend gets interested , and they tell the friend the mantra , just to save the initiation fee . It does n't work . There was a guy in Rhode Island who used somebody else 's mantra and he got edgy and irritable and lost energy . It 's worth the fee . " The fee was $45 for students and $75 for adults . The fee for adults is now up to $125 . We filled out questionnaires , and we made appointments for Saturday . " Bring six to twelve fresh flowers , two to three sweet fresh whole fruit , and a clean white handkerchief . And the fee for the course , " Buzz said . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use any recreational chemicals while you are learning TM . Give it a chance to work . We find that many people cut down on their recreational chemicals after learning meditation . " Hands went up in the audience . What kind of fruit ? What kind of flowers ? They wanted to be told exactly . All recreational chemicals ?  | On Saturday I reported with one apple , one orange , one white handkerchief , and a bouquet from the florist . We were in the basement of a university building . No English 212 today . One at a time , we went into the initiation room ( English 212 ) . Candles , incense , fruit . lots of flowers , very pretty . It was so dark in the room I could barely see the pictures scotch-taped on the wall : Maharishi , I supposed , and Guru Dev , his teacher . The offerings , said Buzz , were symbolic , flower of life , fruit the seed of life , and the handkerchief , the cleansing of the spirit . Buzz went through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with rice , salt , and sandalwood . " What was that ? " I said when he stopped . " That 's the ceremony , initiation , " Buzz said . " Some of it is the names of the masters who preserved the technique . We 're grateful to the Vedic tradition for having preserved it ; it 's as applicable today as thousands of years ago . Okay , I 'm going to give you your mantra . The mantra is meaningless , a sound whose effect is known . Your mantra is Shiam. " * " Shiam ? " I said . " Shiam ? You sure Shiam is mine ? " Buzz looked stunned . What 's the matter with Shiam ? And I was thinking : You sure it 's Shiam and not Shiom ? And I had been looking for some basic Sanskrit sound , Hum or Aum or Hrim or Barn ; I did n't exactly remember Shiam . And I was also remembering an unpublished article on the " rise times " of sounds in physiological psychology , how mantras were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing sharp , lots of soft mmm 's and o 's , see , Campbell 's Soup is secretly conditioning you , they have you going mmm-mmm good . " Shiam , " Buzz said . " Let 's say it . " We said it . " Okay , just keep it going . to yourself , and if thoughts come let them come , and do n't try . " We closed our eyes . I could see the letters : SHIAM . Then I thought . I bet these guys screwed up my mantra , that one does n't sound quite right , there 's no quality these days , car mechanics fake repairs ; plumbers , no craftsmen left ; but at the same time I knew just as many mantras as Buzz , so I thought . well , what the hell , they all work , and I kept it going . It was very quiet . Toward the end of the twenty-minute period I peeked a couple of times . Buzz had his eyes shut and was breathing evenly . I tried at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shiam Shiam Shiam , fast . It does n't have to stay consistent . " Very slowly , open your eyes , " Buzz said . " Take a couple of minutes to come out . " Was it easy ? Yes . Was it pleasant ? Yes . Did the mantra change , get faster or slower or disappear ? Yes . Did thoughts come ? Yes . Good . Buzz said I could have my handkerchief and @# flowers and fruit back . I took the handkerchief . I ate the apple , and I left the orange and the flowers . In our midweek sessions , we discussed our experiences and asked questions . Did anybody forget their mantra ? Some people had . Okay , do n't worn ' about it , if it does n't come back in a couple of days , call your instructor . Did the mantra show up sometimes when it was n't TM time ? Tell it cheerfully to go away , like a friend who has dropped in when you 're working . Did people fall asleep while meditating ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and finish . Did a lot of thoughts come That 's okay , just notice the thoughts and go back to the mantra . Why were n't we getting progressively better ? Because there 's always the release of stress , until the very last stress is relieved , and that 's pure consciousness . When you 're in pure consciousness . do you know it ? No , you know it later . Does the appearance of the thought corr. spond in intensity to the stress released ? No . A of people had n't noticed any change in themselves . You wo n't notice the change , it 's like staring at .. rosebud all night ; by morning it 's bloomed , but it ' , hard to notice the changes . I asked Buzz , after class , " Is this a good job Part-time ? " " For me , you mean ? " Buzz said . " Well . Ni make a little , but you could certainly make more doing something else in the same time . " There seemed to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We went to get out meditations checked .

We do not concentrate , we do not try . Any questions ? Yes , do a lot of people thin : ; this is a waste of time ? Yes , but the effects are ing on whether you think they are or not . just keep going . Did a lot of people think they we : doing it wrong ?

Well , I get ft meditation part , but where is the transcendent. : We are transcending thought when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then the min , transcends everyday awareness and experience pure awareness , or cosmic consciousness . " That name puts people off , " said one of tit . TM hierarchy . " We should n't say transcendent. : we should say approaching transcendental ; I wish Maharishi had called it creative intelligence . " ( TI : Science of Creative Intelligence is the name of course within TM . ) But is it really different from sitting with your eyes shut , or taking a nap ?  | The Maharishi may have thought he had failed at one point , but events were running independent of him . Actually , while TM faded from the newspapers , and the Maharishi faded from the talk - shows , the word-of-mouth on TM continued , so . it the numbers of people who signed up for the course did n't diminish . But the candidates were to change character ; TM was to shift slowly from the exotic , **25;1327;TOOLONG Sixties thing to -e more traditional Ben Franklin , early-to-bed , ) ale Carnegie self-help American procedure . At le pivot point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles , Robert Keith Wallace . Wal'ace had begun TM as an undergraduate at 1 CLA , and he was a friend of Jerry Jarvis , who had been one of the protagonists in starting the Students ' International Meditation Society . Wallace proposed a Ph.D . thesis in physiology . : t UCLA . " Maharishi had been free to go out with a , ample technique , because he was n't part of a religious hierarchy , and I was free to try something in physiology that nobody with an established reputation would want to risk , " Wallace said . Maharishi liked the idea . Nobody had done anything objective , the West was objective , Maharishi said . In India , people went uncritically from master to master , without distinguishing techniques . For his thesis experiment , Wallace wired up twenty-seven meditators . Each subject would sit connected to instruments that would record continuously . Each subject had a catheter in one artery in the arm ; the arm would be poked through a hole in a curtain so the subjects would n't see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because most people do not find the sight of their blood gurgling into instruments conducive to serenity . The wires were on for blood pressure , heart rate , rectal temperature , skin resistance , and EEG . The subjects sat quietly for thirty minutes , then did twenty to thirty minutes of meditation , and then sat quietly again for another thirty minutes . That must have been some group of meditators . I gave them points just for sitting still with all those wires and with a catheter in the arm . In the middle period , the meditation period , the oxygen consumption on inhaling and the carbon dioxide on exhaling went way down . A 20 percent drop like that really should indicate a lower metabolism . The EEG showed nice alpha patterns . The heart rates slowed by an average of three heats per minute . Resistance of the skin to an electrical current went up fourfold ? the higher the skin resistance , the greater the degree of relaxation . And how did this differ from a good nap ? Well , it does . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it takes a couple of hours to start tapering off during sleep . Skin resis- tance increases during sleep , but not as much as during meditation . ( The carbon dioxide in the blood increases during sleep . There are , of course , different stages of sleep and different patterns within those stages . ) In short , the relaxation Wallace reported was , indeed , deeper than sleep , or than some stages of sleep . In fact , he said , the state produced by Transcendental Meditation was different from waking , dreaming , and sleeping . It was a fourth state of consciousness . Wallace 's thesis , " The Physiological Effects of Transcendental Meditation , " went off to the prestigious journal Science . The report , co-authored with Herbert Benson , a cardiologist and assistant professor of medicine at the Harvard Medical School , appeared not only in Science , but in the American Journal of Physiology , Scientific American , and the New England Journal of Medicine , all very heavy . Benson had been in the Public Health Service in Puerto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Puerto Ricans have fewer cardiac ailments than the mainlanders ? " I give up . Why ? " I said . " Because of their attitude . " Benson said . " Mariana . We need some of that if everybody does n't want to keep dying so young , a different attitude . " Benson was working on primates at the Harvard Medical School , training them to control their blood pressure , when the meditators presented themselves . Wallace and Benson combined on a couple of experiments , and now the results went out with the prestige of a Harvard Medical School by-line . " Mental states can markedly alter physiologic function , wrote Benson and Wallace . They called the meditation state " a wakeful. hypometabolic physiologic state , " a phrase that went ringing through the journals . " Wakeful " because the subjects were awake and you would think they would have to be asleep to get those numbers ; " hypometabolic , " well , remember , hypo is " under , " Greek , and hvper is " over , " excess . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stressful situations " ; a hypometabolic state " may accompany meditational states . " What an anomaly , a waking state with such low metabo-lism ! Benson was enthused . One third of all the adults in this country suffer from definite or borderline hypertension , high blood pressure . By meditating , he said , " we may be able to prevent and even treat it . " And , at the same time , Benson said of TM : " It appears that . . . TM is the fastest and easiest way of doing so at this time . " The partnership of Benson and Wallace was not to last . Wallace was quiet , sincere , soft-spoken , but you sensed somehow the steel spring of the divinity student , the true believer . Wallace was , first and foremost , a meditator , a disciple of the Maharishi ; Benson was a physician , a cautious medical 37  | researcher who had never meditated and did n't intend to . Benson winced when his enthusiasm turned up in sleek reprints at all the TM lectures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time I got to Benson and Wallace , they were polite but not really speaking to each other . Wallace became the charter president of Maharishi International University near Santa Barbara ( now in Fairfield , Iowa ) ; when you call , the switchboard operator says , " M-I-U . " Every course includes " the Science of Creative Intelligence " in its title , from astronomy on . Benson was back in the lab , so cautious it took him six months to send me his first paper , so cautious he would n't even let his students know what he was about to publish in some journal , lest somebody leak it to TM and have it turn up in the press or in a glossy reprint at the TM introductory lecture . For ten months , tracking research , I would be calling them alternately , trying to pin down points : " But Benson says . . . " But Wallace says . . . " Benson said he had a new blood pressure study , it was going to come out in The Lancet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't use TM . Could I see it ? No , not now . " Herb , " I said , " it takes three years to do a book like mine ; The Lancet will have hit the stands and have been gobbled up long before . " Nope . Three weeks after The Lancet hit the stands I had my copy from Herb , for which I thanked him , except that my interest had been so whetted that by that time I already had my copy from The Lancet . @# The research rolled on . My favorite headbump phrenology journal , The Journal of Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology , reported that not only did meditators have those dollops of alpha , and different thetas than sleep has , but the brain-wave rhythms were synchronized , and beta spikes were appearing from deep meditation . " That 's when you 're touching consciousness , the beta spike , " said the TM physiology people . A California researcher reported that TM reduced the symptoms of asthma . Poor damn asthmatics , first they got cured by placebo pills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble is in their chests . By now , researching TM was replacing the sit-in in the dean 's office of a few years back . In my own TM class , two students handed out questionnaires . ( What they were researching had already been done ? they did n't seem to know it , but what the hell . ) And the TM people were hitting research like a fixed slot machine , and printing it with pretty charts on sleek paper . FASTER REACTION TIME , said the poster , showing a quarterback with his arm cocked , linemen descending upon him . The State Legislature of Illinois endorsed TM . So did General Davis of the Army War College . Joe Namath was into it , and Bill Walton , the basketball pro , and " there are a couple of strong c tenders for the presidency ? very strong ? who pr tice TM , " said the Research Coordinator . I do n't know when Joe Namath and Bill Walt do their meditating , but I found it hard to do an thing competitive afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball it is go by and sa. , oh , nice shot . It 's okay with you , like you 've had two beers . Charlie Tart , of Altered States , wrote a journal article in response to TM . He said what he seemed to do was to churn through the undigested stuff the day , images , thoughts , much as th : dream mechanism is said to do . The dream mechanism. : is said , runs all that stuff through the brain t has been run through during the day , trying to g it organized on all levels , emotional as well as rational . The longer Tart did it , he wrote , the more all that churning calmed down , leaving him final , . calmer , short of bliss , and with an aversion to alcohol . He went on to more complex discipline where alcohol is considered pretty gross anyway . TM put out a booklet for businessmen , Creator Intelligence in Business , which said that research showed that TM improved behavioral stability lessened susceptibility to psychosomatic disease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased the clarity of perception , improved learning ability , speeded comprehension . produced better memory and faster absorption difficult material ? and that 's only part of it . Plainly , TM was the greatest thing since peach ice cream . And all this from sitting still twice a day , closing  | the eyes , and going " Hrim , Hrim , " or " Shiam , Shiam " ? Well , yes . " Sometimes , " said Wallace , " people make things more difficult than they are . " There are critics . Some academic psychologists called their local TM chapter for guinea pigs , tested them , and found that skin temperature did n't go up as advertised . Some critics said that the TM research was all a series of one-shots , no long-range follow-ups . Some critics said that TM sets up experiments , pops the results , and has them out in a sleek glossy booklet before they are professionally published and critiqued . FASTER REACION TIME , they said , for example , was based on unpublished experiment with only eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people , some of the time , TM works . There , I said it . That is , it teaches a technique of meditation that produces relaxation , and relaxation s some beneficial effects . It may produce even re than relaxation . Meditation works . Funny rase , yet there it is . But before you put me in e newest TM booklet as an endorser saying " TM oaks " ? which it does ? you have to finish the story . Benson , half of the great research team , was . ck in the lab at the Harvard Medical School , without Wallace . Now he emerged from the laboratory firing salvos into the medical journals . ( The ncet article was one . ) Benson had analyzed , disted , and reassembled the whole mantra busis. and TM had no monopoly . No ? What else works ? Some secular techniques , autogenic training , pro- gressive relaxation , and some religious techniques . . Religious techniques ? Well , some forms of Christianity , some forms of Judaism , some forms of Islam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hichiren Sho Shu , Hare Krishna , Meher Baba Everything works ? No , not at all , it 's just that certain techniques can produce an altered state of consciousness , and some altered states of consciousness produce a response of relaxation . In fact , that 's what we 're calling it , " the Relaxation Response . " The Lancet article said Benson and his team had reduced the blood pressure in the experimental subjects without TM and without anything fancy and , in fact , by a very ordinary English mantra . But he did n't call it a mantra . The magic English mantra in a moment . First , let 's see how , in this case , our Western scientific paradigm took us away from something that worked and substituted something much more complex . @# To solve the mysteries of the brain , Western man has been pulling and pushing and analyzing and dissecting . Descartes had brain drawings , the eye sees here and the perception comes here . Camillo Golgi , in the 1890s , devised a stain , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Golgi said these neurons were continuous through the brain , and the great Spanish microscopist , Santiago Ramon y Cajal , disagreed and said each cell was separate , and when they gave them a Nobel Prize jointly in 1906 the fellas would n't speak to each other in Stockholm , threw pillows and sulked . Golgi stains are very pretty . A lady in physiology in Berkeley was making shirts with Golgi stains , very pretty , must be real conversation stoppers , what is that interesting pattern on your shirt , oh , those are neurons from the cerebral cortex . Oh . Must be one of the world 's great ingroups when you 're wearing a Golgi-stain shirt and you see another one in the airport . So here is the neuron looking like , printed in  | black and white , a star or a rhombus , some say . but to me like a fried egg , a little too much pepper in one part of the yolk , and the white splatted out into fingers , as if the pan were really hot and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of one finger and the beginning of the next , on the next fried egg . is a gap . called a synapse by the British neurophysiologist Sir Charles Sherrington , 1897 . Sherrington is a semipoet of neurophysiology , as well as a great teacher who keeps asking his students at Cambridge to bring him something new to learn , and to whom the brain is an " enchanted loom . " Nice . The synapses , the gaps , are devices for processing information , lots of neurons in the cortex , 1010 , and even more synaptic contacts , 1014 . So an Impulse comes chugging down the axon , the long finger coming away from the cell body . Tra la la la la la la , and now it gets to the edge , and how is it going to get across the gap , the synaptic cleft , to the other side ? A cliff-hanger .

D. Adrian becomes Lord Adrian , and the work goes on and Nobel Prizes come fluttering out of Stockholm .

Why does it work ? Start with noise . In our culture . . noise level is incredible . I do n't mean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , or banging the garbage cans early in the morning . Look at it from the point of view of one of your neurons . There 's something to do all the time . A lot of people get up to an alarm radio . even TV . Then maybe they read the paper with cup of coffee . Then they get into their cars a turn on the radio , and they 're so habituated to noise they do n't even listen . News : there is a t nado somewhere and traffic deaths somewhere a a house burned down somewhere . All that no goes pouring through the neurons like syrup through pancakes . And it starts very early . The a erage kid , say the child experts testifying about advertising , watches twenty-five thousand co mercials a year , twenty five thousand reinforcements for sugar-coated Popsy Flakes , Captain Goo , it ' , a tribute to the plasticity of the human brain that the kid can still talk and read ? maybe he can't. hat you can see why he will have his transistor radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sky are only partly real : real reality Is a Popsy Flake commercial . Our experience sha our perception . So we have a lot of practice , a lot of conditioning . what Huxley called " inquietude for the sake of i quietude . " St. John of the Cross wrote about that . ' get junked up just on the inquietude.  | Much of our noise is distorted , and designed to keep us off balance , the noise about office politics and school politics , the noise , well , the television commercials are a cliche but there they are , five hours per family per night saying you are not okay , your floors do not shine , your coffee tastes lousy , you are exuding odors from fourteen parts of your body and further : health is something you as a consumer have to buy . from the dispensers of health , otherwise you 're going to be up all night and your stomach 's going to churn , never mind the natural self-corrections in the body . you 'd better get in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you have to buy it . That one alone costs hundreds of millions , not only over the counter , but as a matter of public policy . And so ? almost instinctively ? we do n't believe it . or do n't believe much of it , and the tension of sorting out , amidst all the noise , what is true and what is not true takes extra energy ? we are not even aware of the tension . And that 's just the exterior noise ; the confusing messages in the exterior noise are quite enough to produce a need for a quiet interior place . But we also have the interior noise . being language-using. conscious , conceptualizing animals , and the interior noise is even louder . Ratcheta ratcheta ratcheta , Molly Bloom 's soliloquy . me my mine , that guy in the office is and I should n't have said that yesterday and the prices keep going up and when the phone rang I thought and so on . Even if you turn off the TV , thereby missing the possibility of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a tennis playoff ? no matter what time of year , lots of noise there ? the interior noise will get you , you 've had so much practice at it . Say Mommy , baby . Say Mommy . Say Grammaw . See Grammaw ? Smile . Say Grammaw to Grammaw . The neurons have been twitchng so long they think not twitching is abnormal . Once in mid-Arizona a friend of mine got up in the morning bleary-eyed and said he had had no sleep . Why no sleep ? There was a beagle outside my window . I thought it was a great phrase , something worthy of Joyce . Finnegans Wake maybe , God is a shout in the street . There is a beagle outside my window . What kind of beagle ? Friendly , tri-colred , tail-wagging , did it sit on the roof of its doghouse flying a Sopwith Camel and dodging the ed Baron ? This damn beagle , said the friend , must have seen after a jackrabbit. yawp yawp yawp yawp . All night , yawp yawp yawp yawp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows , yawp yawp yawp , and the sound echoes in the neuronal pathways even when we 're asleep , even when there is 10 beagle there and even when we are asleep we ill talk to ourselves constantly . Not only does that talk limit the perceptions of reality , it gives the @# neurons busywork . So : the mantra gives you a bone for the beagle , you can throw it right out there , and once you 've thrown it there 's nothing much else to do . You may hear some growling and clicking , but if it works you wo n't hear yawp yawp yawp . Of course , the beagle may not pick up the bone . But maybe it will . Rest deeper than sleep ? Some of the neurons are quieter when you 're asleep , and others work even harder , trying to get things organized for tomorrow , all lined up and consistent . If you can wind up this phrase and send it through on its own momentum , balam balam balam , waking does not matter , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their little toes and snooze . Why does it work ? " A good vibe , " said a countercultural voice . " A mantra is a sound whose effect is known , " said the telephone company . Wallace had a guess . Wallace and I spoke in Physiology , in which he was fluent and in which I knew just enough to say , I wish please to cash a traveler 's check , where is the bathroom , I wish to speak to the manager . " Some structure in the brain creates order , " said Wallace . " We know the reticular system gates out inputs . " " So far , so good . " " As you decrease the activity in the sympathetic nervous system , the system gets more orderly . " " Is that true ? " " Sure , not only do you have synchronization between the brain hemispheres , which you do n't normally see , but you get harmonics of alpha as well as alpha , ten twenty forty eighty . " I said I must have missed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus and the passive direction allow the thalamus to fire at its natural rhythm . " Firing in natural rhythm ! Lovely . " And that affects the hypothalamus . " Thalamus , the seat of all that sensorimotor activity in the midbrain , the word comes from thalamos , nuptial couch in Greek . Imagine that . And hypothalamus then is under the nuptial couch , and the instructions to fight or flee thus come from under the nuptial couch . Very insightful , Dr. Freud . " I think in meditation , " said Wallace , " there will be an analogy like superconductivity in physics , a place where there is no resistance at all . " The rishis who invented the mantras did not have in mind that you could go to the office and see the boss differently , or move the new warehouse to South Carolina without raising your blood pressure , or watch the portfolio go down another 15 percent with equanimity . They had in mind merging consciousness with Consciousness , they said . " Well , they study infinity in physics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is higher consciousness . "  | The beagles of the mind are well known to all philosophies , though they are called by many names . TM gives you an immediate device for beagle-soothing , but other schools want you to be aware first of how your mind works . It is always a different matter to recognize something conceptually and to experience it . @# The year before I got to TM , I was in a course called Arica , which was a full-time esoteric school . One of the exercises ? you could call it a meditation ? went like this . You get a rock . ( Some people got very pretty rocks , since they were going to be doing this exercise six days a week , four hours a day . ) Class exercise . You put your rock on the floor in front of you ; you can sit on a pillow . You put your consciousness in the rock . I was confused . How do you do that ? Now you take a breath , pick up the rock , hold your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of you . Your eyes are shut . And while you move the rock , you think , On namo narava naya , which you can spot immediately as a Sanskrit mantra . Then you exhale and put the rock down , take another breath , and do the same thing left-handed , two repetitions of the mantra per circle of the rock per breath . That 's the beginning ; it goes on . The last motion ? same mantra going ? is to circle your head with the rock , and visualize a white light making the same circle inside your head . Then you start over . Four hours . Nobody ever said that was a relaxation exercise . though you would think with all those circles and mantras and breathing the beagles would all be occupied . And you were n't supposed to think anything else ; just Om namo naraya naya . My first reactions were : my knee hurts , this is silly , this is very boring , Om namo naraya naya , I lost the count there . what time is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naya. this is the dumbest thing I 've ever seen , Om namo naraya naya , my nose itches , Om namo naraya naya , what shall we have for dinner , look , that guy is already circling his head with his rock , Om namo naraya naya , I think I 'll quit this whole business , this is the most boring invention since piano lessons , these are the piano scales of the mind , dum da da da da da dum . I went to lunch with two classmates on the third day , a physician and a psychologist . Physician , B.S. , M.D. , and psychologist . B.A. , M.A. , Ph.D . And you know what we talked about ? How big do you make your circle ? Is it better to have a big rock or a little rock ? Is it better to have a pretty rock or a plain rock ? Is n't this the most boring thing , I wonder what it leads to ? Can you make a white light go on at the same time the rock is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we get back to class ? 42 Along about the second week , I got very Prussian and conscientious . I was only going to think Om namo naraya naya , and nothing else ! Just like the good Germans in Autogenic Training . Enou of the chitter-chatter ! No more what time is it . knee hurts , it 's so pretty outside why am I in he No more ! And I could n't do it . It was like reading the sentence Do n't think of an elephant : by the time you 've read " elephant " it 's too late . Something a ways popped up : it was n't a verbal thought , it " +as an image , and not a white light image , either . So I decided to do the opposite : I would not sa Om namo naraya naya , I was just going to go o a list of stocks and review what each company earned the previous year and what it was expect to earn this year . That was more successful , exce for the occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went home that night and I looked up all the stocks and their estimated earnings and the prices , and I was rarely more than a nickel off . R action : first , a little flutter of pride : second , an a solute wave of horror . All those numbers are ready in the books , and that 's what I 'm carrying around in my head ! It was like opening the attic door and this foul air comes out and there 's all this junk lying around , bits of pictures , pieces 4 papers with old phone numbers , legs of old to . bicycle tires for vanished bicycles , wishes , inhi tions , dreams , old conversations , conversations t way they should have come out , junk ! Who is th who has all that junk in his head ? By chance , a friend came by and we went off meet an ex-psychologist called Richard Alpert his old incarnation ? the ex-sidekick of Leary ? a Baba Ram Dass in his present , and he said what it you 're doing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sort of hatha yoga and an hour of Tibet chanting and then we turn this rock in a circle f four hours ? " Ah , " he said ? and I said , I am v depressed because my mind is a pile of junk . " That 's nice , that 's nice . " said Baba Ram D " You 're doing well . The Indians say the mind is drunken monkey , you know . When I went to India , I went to this monastery . and they showed into this little cell , and they said , count v breath , and we 'll bring the food right here . And said , well , I do n't think I want to do that rig now , and they said , okay . that 's what we do here . so if you 're not ready , let us know whenever you 're ready . So I said okay , breathe in , breathe out . one . breathe in , breathe out . two . And I thought of al the ice-cream sundaes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and old conversations , and f ture conversations , and in the afternoons I wou think , there 's an afternoon flight from Delhi New York at three-thirty , I could walk out of he I could be in Delhi tonight , I could be on the flight tomorrow . "  | " But you did n't . " " No , I did n't . " " So your mind is a drunken monkey , too . " " Everybody 's mind is a drunken monkey , but Bey are n't aware of it . Now you 're aware of it . " " I may have been just as happy not being aware fit . " But too late ; do n't think of an elephant . I went Eck to Om namo naraya naya , only now there as a little distance between me and the drunken monkey , enough so I could say , what is the runken monkey going to come up with now ? Let 's get back to work ? What 's for dinner ? This hole exercise is dumb ? What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Steel and the president of the AFL-CIO , if ose gentlemen were sitting turning a rock and going Om namo naraya naya , their minds would c next year 's budget and last year 's budget and golf scores and children 's marks , images of yes , images of secretaries , obsolete airline schedles , disjointed columns of numbers already in the aks ? the whole array . Czech poetry . Scandinan drinking songs . The lesson that seeps through can be a little chilling : your head is not your friend . Not automatitlly . " The mind , " said St. Teresa , the fifteenth-century Spanish mystic , " is an unbroken horse . " at gives us beagles , monkeys , and horses , but u get the idea . @# Not all religious disciplines want to teach you to still the mind , especially not in two weekends ; some want you first to see its cure , or their version of its nature . But perhaps religion to altered states to relaxation to lowered blood pressure is a bit cumber , me . TM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; now Benson , the Harvard Medical School half of the old research team , was to take out the rest . But first he had to review the physicological benefits religion had had when it and not science was the paradigm : " In the Western world today , " wrote Benson and is associates in Psychiatry , " there is a growing inrest in nonpharmacological , self-induced , altered . lies of consciousness because of their alleged benefits of better mental and physical health and improved ability to deal with tension and stress.During the experience of one of these states , individuals claim to have feelings of increased creative . of infinity , and of immortality ; they have an angelistic sense of mission , and report that men1 and physical suffering vanish . Subjective and objective data exist which support the hypothesis at an integrated central nervous system reaction , e relaxation response , ' underlies this altered state f consciousness . Physicians should be knowldgeable of the physiologic changes and possible health benefits of the relaxation response . " A Nobel-winning Swiss physiologist , Walter Hess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ergotropic , " response , and its opposite , called the " trophotropic , " in the brain of the cat . A relaxation spot in the brain ! " . . . the anterior hypothalamus , " wrote Benson , " extending into the supra- and pre-optic areas , septum and inferior lateral thalamus . " As Hess had said , there were no specific foci for  | isolated responses , " but a collective representation of a group of responses . " And how do you get to the anterior hypothalamus to get the message to relax ? Benson delineated four elements : ( 1 ) Mental Device . " There should be a constant stimulus , e.g. a sound . word , or phrase repeated silently or audibly. or fixed gazing at an object . The purpose of these procedures is to shift from logical , externally-oriented thought . " Benson did not mention " mantra. " ( 2 ) Passive Attitude . Do n't worry about how you 're doing , and if thoughts come , go back to the technique . ( 3 ) Decreased Muscle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy . ( 4 ) Quiet Environment . Shut your eyes ( except for meditations in gazing at an object ) . If the effects of the relaxation response held up long-term . Benson and his associates wrote , the effect on the economics of therapy would be profound , " since it is practiced at no other cost than time . " " You 're talking about the $125 mantra at TM . " I suggested . " I think TM is fine if that 's what you want . " Benson said . " But other things work . too . " " Prayer ? " " Well , not prayer quite in the conventional sense . But if a Catholic comes in. say , and wants to use some childhood prayer , that 's fine , although most of those prayers have a lot of syllables . We do n't propose it voluntarily , because a lot of prayers are n't neutral ; the way they were taught has left some emotional residue , guilt or tension . " " Do you have an alternate mantra , neutral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit quietly , close your eyes , relax all your muscles , beginning at your feet and moving up to your face ? " " ? like progressive relaxation ? " " ? like progressive relaxation , and you become aware of your breathing . You breathe through your nose , and as you breathe out , you think to yourself . One ? in , out ? One ? in , out ? One . " " Your mantra is One ? How did you pick that ? " " Well , we were looking around the lab , you ca n't use pen or pencil , some people might have hang-ups about pens or pencils , you ca n't have people count very high . if they 're really relaxed . they 'll lose the count , and if they start to worry they lose the passive attitude , and the Zen breathing exercises had people counting to some low number like three . " " So you picked One . No other numbers ? " " Well , the next one up that 's euphonious. that does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nine . " " What about the religious significance of One ? " " What religious significance ? " 44 " Well , there 's the One in Oriental philosophy , as opposed to the Nothing , there 's the One in Meiste Eckhardt , the mystic , and there 's the One in Indian religion of the Being , the All , the Units . there 's the Hebrew , The Lord Our God , The Lord Is One ? ' " Oh , Lord , we did n't think of that , " Benson said . There was some silence on the phone for . " But I do n't think that 's going to hang up too many people . If they 're hung up on One , we 'll find another sound , but One is neutral to most people . " I called up Wallace . Wallace had been away . and had n't seen the latest Lancet or Psychosomatic Medicine . " One ? " he said . " One ? " " One , " I said . " Maybe , in extreme emergencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood pressure ? " " It looks like about eleven millimeters of mer curt ' in the mean systolic , and about five diastolic : - " What was the drop in oxygen consumption ? " " From 258.9 to 225.4 , and carbon dioxide down about 12 percent . " Nobody said anything . " That 's nice , " Wallace said . " That 's very nice . " " I have this slightly used mantra ? " I said . " It may be that a lot of things will work . " Wal lace said , " though we were the first to test the technique , and we 'll have the first long-range stud ies . Other techniques may produce relaxation , but there is a difference between a mantra and oth sounds , a subtle but real difference . And we ha . classes and free checking , and the support of oth meditators , people need that , people like that . " ( In , fairness , the TM fee is the initiation fee . an subsequent classes and checking are indeed free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country side at nominal cost. ) @# come did a little informal polling . Both Benson a ough Wallace were right . Benson 's mantra ? One ak to was cheaper , but Wallace did indeed ha teaching and checking and group support . In t at ? " poll . I told people I had a meditation techniqu you The technique was the same , but one version of have came from the Harvard Medical School and have other version came from India . The Harvard Med axed , cal School version was free and the Indian o , vorry cost $75 , a white handkerchief , some fruit a - eath-  flowers , and two weekends . Which one works ? low Nobody wanted the Harvard Medical Scht technique . What does the Harvard Medical Schc. know about meditation ? And free ? Why free ? Ho that can it be any good if it 's free ? No , let 's have t art , is Indian technique . But what impressed the poll about the Indian technique was not the fruit . t to ? " white handkerchief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reprints from the Harvard Medical School ! Th  | wanted the mantra validated by the doctors ! Some further research showed that Benson was right , TM had no monopoly as a relaxation technique , and Wallace was right , a system of mediation had many subtle gradations . It was true that meditation was a relaxation response as Benson said ; many people fell asleep during their meditations . But it was more than just relaxation . Benson had stopped too soon , or had been too general . A Harvard psychologist , Daniel Goleman. got the wires out for a group of meditators and a control group , and showed them both an extremely stressful safety movie , in which fingers were lost in machinery , circular saws bit into workers ' stomachs , and so on . The meditators perceived more quickly , and recovered their equilibrium more quickly . " Meditation practice is not simply a re:axed state , but the capacity for focused attention . " said the report . It speculated that what this capacity for focused attention did was to unlink the cortical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system and the autonomic and emotional system . Thus the meditators were not only quicker to return to equilibrium and more at home in that state , but also more alert . " A wakeful. hypometabolic state , " Benson and Wallace had written , but the emphasis seemed to be on the relaxation , on the word " hypometabolic . " The meditators were also " wakeful , " though there was not as much attention on that . Of course , for busy people , there was the problem of when and where to meditate . For commuters in buses and trains , the commuting time is ideal . It looks like you 're just catching a little nap . But for commuters who drive to work . there 's a problem : you have to keep your eyes open while driving . ( Advanced meditators in other techniques might be able to do it . ) What about noncommuters ? What about busy people in mid-city ? " We have the solution , " said some friends . Churches . " " Churches ? " " Sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are quiet and respect silence . Some of them even say , Enter , rest , and pray . So you go m. you slip into the last pew , and you do your mantra for twenty minutes . It 's terrific . You can do on the way to lunch , or after work . " I tried it myself . Churches were indeed the solution ? the only place open in mid-city that respected lence , other than the public library . Fabulous ! Sometimes the organist would be practicing ? that id n't hurt the meditation at all . Sometimes I looked at the very few other people in the church ? what was in their minds ? Mantras in what Ianuage ? Were they asking for something or were thev meditating ? We meditators were so grateful for the churches that we began dropping dollar bills in the collection box . It seemed proper and felt good . So now upwards of a million people must be going gazoom , gazoom to themselves on the bus , or breathing in one nostril , end out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath . And it works ! They all work ! Maybe the curve for tranquilizer sales is about to turn down . Our commercial society led us to believe we did not have health , we had to buy it . Who would have thought we could get such a boost from the yogis ? i and warn the people not to eat cheese . know some of those jerks are going to eat and then what do we do ?
