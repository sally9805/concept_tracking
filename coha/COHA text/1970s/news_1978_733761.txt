txt The central question now put to Israel is starkly simple : Will it rule out further settlement and annexation of territory in the West Bank in return for a full peace with Egypt , the negotiation of new borders with Jordan and West Bank Palestinians , and a definition of its continuing security requirements beyond those borders ? Having brought President Sadat to the offer of such a deal , the United States need make no apology for pressing hard for a clear Israeli answer . After the negotiations at Salzburg and Leeds Castle , it is up to Israel to put Mr. Sadat to the test . He says he will bring Jordan and Palestinians to the table if the above agenda is accepted by Jerusalem . He says he will not rule out moving the final borders from the 1967 lines . He says he understands the need for an Israeli military presence beyond those lines . He says the timing of Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank is negotiable . And he says that if Jordan or the West Bank Palestinians refuse to negotiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israelis will not lightly trust these propositions ; that would be imprudent . But in the end there is only one way to test them . Israel needs to state whether there is any conceivable package of security arrangements ? short of claiming the West Bank for gradual absorption ? that is worth a peace with Egypt , acceptance by Jordan and an important community of Palestinians , and an end of the dangerous erosion of American support . Is it for the safety of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv that Israel bargains , or for ancestral rights in Hebron ? Prime Minister Begin has so confused the matter , even in his parliament and Cabinet , that he risks sacrificing Israel 's poignant need for security on an altar of territory . Mr. Begin asks whether he has not been generous enough in postponing Israeli claims of sovereignty in the West Bank and offering " self-rule " to the million Palestinians there and in Gaza . Why has Jordan failed to negotiate from that point ? Probably because Jordan , like a growing number of prominent Israelis , unReproduced derstands the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own communities , Israelis financed by their Government and protected by their army would continue to buy and settle West Bank lands so that when the question of sovereignty is next examined , they will have completely altered the face of the region . Behind a shield of security , they would have staked out claims to more territory . If it were not so , why have there been no Israeli security proposals ? as for the Sinai ? that plainly renounce the ambition for territory ? Israel rightly insists on negotiating only with those Arabs who accept its existence . It rightly insists not only on military safeguards in the West Bank but on a voice in defining the political and defense arrangements that would replace its occupation . It demands less vulnerable borders than it had until 1967 and it understandably refuses to cede anything of Jerusalem in ways that would risk another division of that city . These aims can be recognized as essential to the survival and defense of the Israeli heartland and distinct from any hidden intention to expand that heartland . ? The time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations can accept a similar distinction ? if Israelis do . President Sadat merits a test not because he threatens new trouble or more war but because he appears ready to accept the most fundamental requirements of peace . If he does not mean it or can not deliver , how tragic for Israel to bear the blame of having never tried him . It will be said that in accepting his principles for further negotiations , Israel would surrender all claims to the West Bank in exchange for talks that may not soon be held or ever lead to anything . But that is pedantry , not power politics . Israel holds the lands . It either wants to exchange them for still greater security or it can not bring itself to define what that might be . To offer an exchange is not to yield either a principle or an asset . To ask a price is not to consummate a deal . What price , in security , for the territory ?                 @ @ @ @
