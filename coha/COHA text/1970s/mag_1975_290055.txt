After almost six years of drift , depression and disaster , prosperity seems to have returned in force to the U.S. stock market . Paced by a swelling optimism that the worst of the recession could well be over , Wall Street 's fortunes have turned decidedly upward . Last week , in a bullish performance typical of many since the beginning of the year , the Dow Jones industrial average spurted 29 points to 819 , a high for the year , before backing off to 808 on Friday . Still , that was 230 points above the widely watched index 's twelve-year low of 578 last Dec. 6 . In little more than four months , the average has retraced more than half of its precipitous drop from the alltime high of 1052 in January 1973 . <P> No one is discounting the possibility that the surge on Wall Street could be short-lived . As American Stock Exchange President Paul Kolton put it cautiously last week , " You ca n't have three good months and say it Wall Street 's tailspin is over . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prices for stocks in the Dow Jones industrials are up 30% so far this year , and even long-suffering mutual funds are doing nicely . Once again , brokers are making money . Figures to be released soon by the New York Stock Exchange will probably show that its 425 member firms earned pretax profits of around $300 million through March , a record for any quarter . By comparison , Big Board member firms earned a mere $45.8 million during all of last year and lost $49 million in 1973 . <P> Life-giving trading volume , which loped along through most of last year at below subsistence levels , helping to drive 45 firms out of business or into merger , raced along at an average of 22 million shares on the N.Y.S.E . in February and March . One day in February , volume jumped to an improbable 35 million shares , the highest ever ; last Thursday 32 million shares changed hands . The price of a seat on the New York Stock Exchange climbed back up to $95,000 last week , from $72,000 in January . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting edge of a long-feared change in Wall Street 's business practices that is scheduled to go into effect next week . By order of the Securities and Exchange Commission , the industry 's watchdog , what remains of Wall Street 's barnacled century-old system of charging uniform , fixed commissions for buying and selling stock will end . On May 1 , negotiated commissions between brokers and the investing public will begin on all trades . Investors will be able to shop among competing brokers for the lowest commissions and the best services . Wall Streeters , who have done battle with the Government for a decade over negotiated rates , had given the event a designation that in itself is a distress signal : " Mayday . " <P> To stockbrokers , Mayday means nothing less than the abolition of the system that has enriched them in good times and pulled many of them through during long periods of market slack . What is more , negotiated-or " unfixed " - commissions will begin a drastic restructuring of the securities markets . <P>        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
