This division is no longer the exclusive province of Washington and Dallas . The reviving city of Philadelphia , which has shouldered its way to the forefront of hockey and baseball , not to mention box lacrosse , is now ready to make its presence felt in the NFL . That 's right , fans ! Watch out for the Eagles ! // The turnabout in Philadelphia started last year with the arrival of Coach Mike McCormack . Only live of the 22 regulars he inherited will be starting this Sunday , and three of those will be at new positions . Last season McCormack transformed the Eagles ' offense from the third-worst in football into the second-best . The hero  --  some Philadelphians prefer " the messiah "  --  was Roman Gabriel , the ex- Los Angeles Ram quarterback who was the only passer in the NFL to throw for more than 3,000 yards . His main targets were 6 ' 8 " Harold Carmichael , whose 67 receptions led the league , and 6 ' 4 " Tight End Charles Young , who made All-Pro as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Along with 6 ' 3 " Don Zimmerman , these receivers were known as the Fire High Gang because , as the story goes , whenever Gabriel called a passing play , one of them would say , " Fire high , baby . " // Philadelphia also moved the ball well along the ground . Oft-injured Running Back Norm Bulaich played in all 14 games , gained 436 yards and caught 42 passes for 403 more . Tom Sullivan , who paints in the Impressionist manner and spent a month in the off-season touring the Everglades in a canoe , ran for a surprising 968 yards and caught 50 passes . They were aided by the blocking of three players McCormack got in the first two rounds of the draft : Tackle Jerry Sisemore , Center Guy Morriss and Young . // Defense , unfortunately , was a different story . Only twice all year did the Eagles hold opponents to fewer than 23 points . McCormack is trying to change Philadelphia from a reading defense to an aggressive one . His prime objective throughout the off-season was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eagles opened their training camp , he traded his first draft choice in 1977 and his first and second in 1978 to Cincinnati for Bill Bergey . " Bergey , " says McCormack , " is a defensive Roman Gabriel . " In the pursuit of aggression the Eagles also acquired 6 ' 3 " Chicago Bear Cornerback Charlie Ford , known as " The Blade " for his slim build and hitting technique . // The Eagles still have their shortcomings . Despite encouraging preseason performances by their young quarterbacks , John Reaves and rookie Mike Boryla , they rely heavily on Gabriel . Last year , in their second game against Dallas , whom they had already beaten once , the Eagles were leading 10-0 before Gabriel got hurt . They lost 31-10 . Now Gabriel has to lead teammates who were angered by his apparent anti-union stance during the strike . The defensive line is somewhat unsettled and inexperienced and , significantly , many of the defensive players profess a low opinion of the team 's defensive coaches . Still , the Eagles are coming fast . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morale problem endangers that status . Traditionally , the Cowboys have been a triumph of speed and power over emotionalism . They have never been a happy group . " If they were a close-knit team , no one would ever touch them , " says one veteran Redskin . Now Dallas may have more internal problems than it can suppress . // The strike was a divisive force . " It got to be a black-white thing on this team , and it could tear everything up , " says Wide Receiver Bob Hayes . And defections to the WFL have hit the Cowboys harder than any other team . Already , eight Dallas veterans have decided to jump . Most prominent is Calvin Hill , a 1,000-yard rusher the last two seasons . There has always been a question about Hill 's durability ; now there are additional questions about his lame-duck status and his feelings as a disappointed player representative . // For all their troubles , the Cowboys are loaded with talent . Roger Staubach led the league in passing last year . On defense , Ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the NFL draft , should eventually win a starting spot at end , and in passing situations will team with another end , Harvey Banks Martin , to give Dallas its biggest pass rush in years . Defensive Tackle Bob Lilly has returned for his 14th season in surprisingly sound condition , and Linebacker Lee Roy Jordan improves with age . He had his best year in 1973 , winning All-Pro honors. // One glaring weakness could be the kicking game . Placekicker Toni Fritsch needed surgery on his left knee after he was cut down on a kickoff in an exhibition game and will be lost for the season . Fritsch 's replacement , free agent Harry Kokolus , pulled a muscle and his replacement , George Hunt , has missed his last three extra-point attempts . // The Redskins thought they had found the answer to their kicking woes . After erratic Curt Knight retired , saying he would never play for George Allen again , the Skins signed Mark Moseley , a free agent cut loose by Houston last year . Moseley was flawless in the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to be true . It was . He missed two extra points in a two-point loss to the Steelers. // While critics gleefully anticipated the decline and fall of the Allen empire , Allen stayed , as always , one step ahead of the game . He traded three draft choices  --  what else is new ?  --  for the rights to Safety Bryant Salter , who had played out his option in San Diego , and beat out the WFL by signing him . He also became the first coach to trade for a player who had signed with the new league when he got Running Back Larry Smith from Los Angeles . // Allen thrives on controversy . He talked his most consistent lineman , Defensive End Ron McDole , out of retiring , then picked up insurance by acquiring 35-year-old San Diego End Deacon Jones , who made headlines this year only because he was fined for drug abuse . McDole and Jones both play the left side and both were expecting to start , which created an impossible situation coaches other than Allen try to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billy Kilmer should be better now that postseason surgery has cleared an intestinal block that had him commuting from the hospital to the playing field . Charley Taylor , the leading active receiver in football , and Roy Jefferson are a good pass-catching , blocking pair . Running Back Larry Brown has rid himself of persistent injuries and the personal hurt he felt last year over a contract dispute ( and Washington 's acquisition of Duane Thomas to help settle that dispute ) . The Redskin defense led the league with 53 sacks and finished second in interceptions with 26. // Yet there are question marks . Last season the offensive line was hobbled by leg miseries that resulted in a league-low 3.1 yards per rush . Now Tackle Terry Hermeling is out with a knee injury , and Allen is desperately patching with players who would be considered over the hill elsewhere . To make matters worse , Running Back Charlie Harraway jumped to the WFL and the status of his replacement , the talented but moody Thomas , is a continuing mystery . And Allen has yet to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Of course , not everyone can be a contender . The St. Louis Cardinals have suffered through three straight 4-9-1 seasons . That streak and their other one  --  two straight years without a player in the Pro Bowl  --  should continue . Last year new Coach Don Coryell got the team 's offense untracked . When the Cards scored more than 30 points , which they did four times , they won . Otherwise , it was no soap . The team finished dead last in defense . So what did the Cardinals do ? They traded for San Francisco Running Back Ken Willard . And they drafted Tight End J. V. Cain of Colorado , even though they already had a tight end in Jackie Smith . Smith and Cain will play at the same time , with one or the other splitting wide on most plays . Then , during the preseason , St. Louis acquired Chicago Wide Receiver Earl Thomas , who can also play tight end . // The New York Giants have a new director of operations , Andy Robustelli , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of assistant head coach under Don Shula in Miami . Together , they have brought much-needed organization to a team that all too often has been run paternally instead of professionally . The Giants are building . Their first two draft picks , Ohio State 's John Hicks and Southwest Missouri State 's Tom Mullen , will start on the offensive line . Their third pick , Linebacker Rick Dvorak of Wichita State , is being trained at the " 53 " position Arnsparger made famous at Miami and which he plans to use extensively in New York . The Giants appear to be on the road up , but it 's a long road and in the National East there are no shortcuts .
