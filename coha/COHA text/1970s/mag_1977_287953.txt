Soon after canal negotiators reached agreement last week , Panama 's strongman , Brigadier General Omar Torrijos Herrera , lunched at his Pacific Coast hideaway known as Farallon ( meaning " small rocky island in the sea " ) with TIME Correspondent Jerry Hannifin . Following a meal of sancocho ( Panama 's national soup ) and hot chili sauce , Torrijos offered the following comments : <P> On the forthcoming U.S. treaty debate I know that President Carter now has a difficult mission , but I am also confident that the moral force of what is right will prevail . When your people are informed of the truth , they will come to know the injustice that was done here some 70 years ago , simply to provide passage for a U.S. merchant fleet . The American people are a moral people , and when they learn the size of the injustice , I believe they will support the new treaty . <P> On his personal commitment to a new treaty I was a major in 1964 , and the orders came to squeeze the demonstrating students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was ashamed . We used sticks on children . And I could do nothing . I began to think . I decided to do something for my people , to lead the decolonization of Panama . <P> On inviting hemisphere leaders to the treaty signing Carter likes the idea . So do I. He has n't yet formally accepted . Other chiefs of state have responded informally , yes . It would be good for them to be here to witness the signing . <P> On waiting until the year 2000 for canal control We have two ways to go : either the slow way , over a generation , or by liberation war , which would be quicker , with a high price in blood-the lives of 50,000 young Panamanians . We prefer the treaty . If the United States does not keep its treaty pledges during the time ahead , then there surely will be trouble . The treaty must be observed . We shall observe it , and we expect the U.S. to do the same . <P> On Panamanian support for the treaty I shall ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new treaty . We already have begun the massive registration of every Panamanian . It is true that I would prefer a generation of Castristas Castro-types to a generation of castrados castrated ones . They may vote no , but I want them to vote . I have faith that my people will vote for the right thing . <P> On the possibility of a new sea-level canal That 's one of the hardest points to answer , for us to give the U.S. a concession to build another canal . For sure , there would be no colonial enclave to go with such a new canal . The treaty will say that we will discuss the possibility of a new sea-level canal if it is in the joint interest of the world community to build it . But my personal opinion is that a sea-level canal is not necessary . Such a canal would be excessively costly , and you ca n't build it in two weeks either . We do n't want it-even wrapped in plastic .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
