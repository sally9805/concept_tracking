Few areas of North America are more isolated or serene than Mexico 's Oaxaca state , astride the Isthmus of Tehuantepec . Foreign visitors are few , and they are usually young Americans interested in eating local " magic " mushrooms . Yet for the past few weeks , Oaxaca ( pronounced wa-hac-a ) has been bustling with unnatural activity . Toting tons of expensive paraphernalia , nearly 800 scientists from 14 countries have descended on the mountainous state . Frightened by the " demon " that the scientists have come to see , superstitious Indian villagers have been busily offering prayers , lighting candles and staging other rituals . Their supplications are designed to keep the demon at a distance . But they are not likely to succeed . On the morning of Saturday , March 7 , the sun will temporarily vanish from the skies of Oaxaca , blotted out by a total solar eclipse . <P> Oaxaca lies directly in the path of the narrow , 100-mile-wide shadow that will be cast by the moon as it moves directly between earth and sun . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer astronomers a ringside seat for the sky spectacular . As the moon 's shadow sweeps northward , millions of Americans and Canadians may also be able to catch a glimpse of a total or nearly-total eclipse , although direct observation can be highly dangerous ( see box ) . The path of totality extends across the Gulf of Mexico , cuts through Florida , Georgia and the Carolinas , brushes past Virginia and New England , and finally disappears at sea beyond Newfoundland and Labrador . Viewers as far away as San Francisco may have an opportunity to see part of what some overly exuberant sky watchers have already dubbed " the eclipse of the century . " <P> Perverse Habit . Actually , solar eclipses are fairly common . As many as five can occur in a single year , although they invariably last no more than a few minutes and often frustrate astronomers by what Veteran Eclipse Watcher Donald H. Menzel of Harvard calls their " perverse habit of hitting desolate regions . " Because of its favorable viewing path and timing-near the peak of the sun 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by astronomers . <P> Millions of dollars have been spent on preparations for what may well be the most intensely observed eclipse in history . Besides the numerous telescopes , cameras and other elaborate gear located in Oaxaca , other equipment is being set up at observatories all along the Eastern Seaboard . By the fortunes of celestial mechanics , the eclipse 's path will cross Wallop 's Island , Va. , where NASA scientists will send up 33 probing rockets as the shadow approaches . In addition , several research planes will seek an above-the-weather look at the eclipse ; a U.S. Air Force KC-135 will even race the moon 's shadow in order to get a few precious extra moments of observation time .
