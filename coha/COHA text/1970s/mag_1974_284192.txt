Last week Val &3233; ry Giscard d'Estaing signified the importance he puts on relations with West Germany by naming France 's Ambassador to Bonn , Jean Sau-vagnargues , as his Foreign Minister . At week 's end the new French President received the Federal Republic 's new Chancellor , Helmut Schmidt , in Paris for their first summit . The two merely outlined strategies for coping with economic and political problems , but nonetheless the modest effort raised guarded hopes in France that the flagging European Community might be revitalized . Reaction was similar in West Germany . TIME Bonn Bureau Chief Bruce Nelan reports : <P> When Helmut Schmidt moved into the Chancellor 's office in Bonn 's Palais Schaumburg , among the handful of photographs he placed next to his desk was an autographed portrait of Valry Giscard d'Estaing . It was not a public relations gesture but rather a symbol of their warm relationship , built up over years of monetary crises and European Economic Community negotiations . As Finance Ministers for their respective governments , they developed not only a solid respect for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a personal friendship . Speaking to each other in English , they are on a first-name basis , which is not particularly remarkable for the gregarious Schmidt but is probably quite special for Giscard . <P> Senior German officials do not expect the personal bond between the two leaders to alter the basic views of national interest so deeply held in both countries . It is well to remember , though , that Willy Brandt and Georges Pompidou did not like and trust each other ; Schmidt and Giscard do . That is a notable advantage even , or perhaps especially , when policies diverge . <P> As far as the EEC is concerned , Schmidt 's priority is a cautious , but real , movement toward economic and monetary integration . Giscard says that he favors that too . But there are trouble signs ahead . For one , France has always been inclined to see the EEC as a bank from which its agricultural economy receives regular , health-giving transfusions . For another , France , with costly social reforms to pay for , needs a growing economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been cooling its own successful economy in order to curb inflation , which is now running at a relatively modest rate of 7.1% , thanks in part to high interest rates and frugal public spending . Trouble is , the tight money situation in West Germany affects Giscard 's hopes for an expanding French economy because it means a shrinking German market for French goods , as well as a more aggressive effort by West German industries to export goods in order to offset slack sales at home . <P> This adds up to one of the thorniest problems that the EEC now faces : chronic payments deficits among all EEC nations , including even those like France whose exports are increasing , but excluding West Germany , which is running consistent surpluses even while its Deutsche Mark rises in value . Compromise will be necessary on both sides .
