txt The Democratic party is like a halfback who played out the season with a bad knee and showed surprising zip in the big same , but must still undergo surgery in the off-season if he is to be right for next year . For the Democrats , the problem is money , and the surgery will begin in a few weeks . The Democratic National Committee is still $9.3-million in debt . In the last 10 months , the figure has not been reduced , partly because national fundraisers were afraid of detracting from the campaigns of Democratic candidates for . the Senate , the House of Representatives and governorships . Keeps Party Afloat Robert Strauss , the Texas lawyer who was elected national treasurer in March , has kept the party afloat through 1970 by developing a list of 50,000 small donors and by persuading 700 larger contributors to provide $100-amonth for nine months . These contributions have met the national committee 's $135,000-amonth expenses . Mr. Strauss hopes to raise enough money in the next eight months to slice at least $2-million to $3-million off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was before Election Day , " Mr. Strauss said in an interview Thursday . " A lot of potential contributors were waiting to see whether we came out of last Tuesday with any reasonable shot at the White // House . We did , and that makes a difference . " Of the first 14 men Mr. Strauss asked this week to serve on a new national finance council , 13 said " yes " and the other said " maybe . " Other wealthy Democrats , Mr. Strauss said , have called him to offer their help . Both Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Senator-elect Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota have promised to help attack the debt . Both will probably he involved in the Democrats ' major fund-raising dinner of the spring , tentatively schedued for Washington in March . Of the $9.3-million , $3-million is accounted for by loans from party supporters such as Arnold Picker of United- Artists Corporation , Lew Wasserman of M.C.A. , Inc. , and John Loeb , a New York investment banker . Another $3-million is owned to various airlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention in Chi- , cago total $1-million more . Mr. Strauss 's plan is to pay , off the smaller debts , which ; account for most of the remaining $3.3 million first , then to whittle away at the airline and telephone company bills . If some progress can be shown soon , party sources report , an effort will he made to persuade the men who lent money in 1965 to settle for about 25 cents on the dollar , and to persuade large corporations also to settle for less than full payment . Difficulty With Corporations The corporations are more difficult because writing off part of the debt might be construed as indirect campaign contributions , which corporations are forbidden to make in contests for Federal offices . Mr. Strauss has told Lawrence F. O'Brien . the Democratic National Chairman , that ' he will show progress by June or resign and return to Texas . It will have to come quickly , hecause Democratic tial hopefuls will soon be shak-H ing the money-trees them- ' selves . Senator Edmund S. Muskie of Maine has alreadyl started , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in key states . A major problem is the fact ) that many of the " fat cats " to whom the party owes money are unlikely to make contributions to the 1972 war chest until the status of their loans has been resolved . Nor are other potential contributors eager to give if they think their money will be used to nay off . say . Mr. Loeb . None of the money contributed to the Committee for National Unity as a result of Senator Muskies election-eve telecast will be available to the national committee . It will be used , instead , to pay for the broadcast and for other expenses . Former Governor W. Averell Harriman of New York , the committee chairman , said in an interview that volunteers had just begun to sort the thousands of letters received in response to the program . He said it was impossible to judge how much had been contributed . The committee will probably stay in existence , said Mr. Harriman , because " it might be helpful in another emergency like the one we found ourselves in last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current business or plans . " Commission urges Changes WASHINGTON , Nov. 14 ( UPI ) ? A Democratic reform commission recommended today that access be limited to the floor at national conventions , in a suggestion designed to eliminate some of the confusion at the huge gatherings . The commission said that passes should go to delegates , alternates , representatives of Presidential candidates , newsmen and others the convention 's arrangements committee may determine necessary . The commission voted to leave with the arrangements committee the control of passes for the balcony . It recommended , however , that the number and distribution should be on a " fair , equitable " basis and the passes should he delivered to the chairmen of the state delegations . Originally , the commission considered proposing that the Democratic National Chairman be in charge of allocation . But commission members decided that was too much patronage for one man .
