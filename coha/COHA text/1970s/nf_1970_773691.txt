txt I00 GREAT ENGINEERS product is only a straightforward technical job , are living even to-day . All inventors perform a service in telling the story of the hardships to be undergone by anyone who is finally to reach his goal by steady persistence . The first machine of considerable size based on Watt 's idea was built . An old plumber assisted Watt the instrumentmaker , and neither of them had much notion of machine construction . The machine was a failure , and Watt was in despair . He had already spent ? 1,000 on the steam engine , far more than was justified in view of the fact that he now had a family , for he had married in 176o . He had neglected his other work , which brought in money , and had now to set about looking again for remunerative work . His own experience had made him acquainted with the instruments used for surveying . There was at that time a great demand for men able to survey canals , roads , and harbours , and he was easily able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in their construction , and was soon well on the way to achieving a reputation as a civil engineer . But he was compelled , as he writes to his friends , to devote all his thoughts to the engine . He was quite unable to think of anything else , he was in the grip of the great problem . He needed help with the engine , and found it in the person of Dr. Roebuck ( 1718-1794 ) , who had come into the chemical industry as a practising physician , and had been the promoter of great undertakings , chiefly in ironworks and mines . Roebuck founded in Scotland the famous Carron Ironworks . Black drew his attention to Watt and his invention . Roebuck himself was best able to judge the potential industrial importance of the engine , and he found the money and gave what other help he could . The results of Watt 's experiments also interested him personally as a scientist and man of learning . But the invention could only be exploited commercially if broad protection by patent could be got . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the help of his friends , in getting through a very wide patent JAMES WATT I0I claim without limiting himself to any details . The form of this claim enabled it to be upheld later in face of bitter litigation . This English patent , one of the most famous in the history of industry , was numbered 913 and dated January 5th , 1769 . Watt now began to build a larger machine at Roebuck 's own house , but this machine seemed never to get finished . Watt was overworked . Only his surveying brought in money , and he was not able to neglect it in favour of the steam engine . Of all things in life , there is nothing more foolish than invention , ' he wrote at the time to one of his friends . Roebuck had compromised himself financially too deeply , he had a load of debts round his neck , and was in despair . Watt was no longer able to pay the costs of the patent . He had been working on the steam engine for twelve years , and thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he , I entered the thirty-fifth year of my life , and I think I have hardly yet done thirty-five pence worth of good in the world ; but I can not help it . ' But the care of his family left him no time for gloomy meditation . Watt , at the time , was carrying out the surveys he had undertaken in a dismal and lonely stretch of country . Autumn storms and continuous rain made work in the open air still more cheerless . And then came suddenly the news that his wife was severely ill . Watt hurried home , but his wife was dead . She , whose happy temperament had often driven away his cares , who had encouraged and consoled him , was torn from his side . The most desperate hour of his life had come . And now came the great turning point . His friend , Dr. Small , introduced him to the great English industrialist Matthew Boulton ( 1728-1809 ) , and the result was a collaboration and friendship out of which grew the practically useful steam engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , at that time , when he met Watt in 1768 , a first-rate industrialist already known far beyond the // confines of England . He had greatly extended his father 's business ; his chief field of activity was metal and ironware . He gave special attention to applied art , and made wonderful silver table services , produced gold leaf , and works in gilt bronze . The manufacture of buckles for shoes and knee breeches , with which he had already had to do when he entered into his father 's business at the age of fourteen , brought in much money . He knew how to make a profit from the belief of his fellow countrymen that everything which came from France was particularly up to date ; he sent his buckles to France , and then imported them from there into England , in order to be able to sell them at a higher price as made in France . He soon became a partner in his father 's firm , and then took up the manufacture of clocks , chiefly with a view to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the training of apprentices . All apprentices who showed promise had to learn drawing . The result was the growth of his business , in a day of small undertakings , into one on a great scale , which in 1775 employed Boo workmen . He built new great factories in Soho near Birmingham . Many other branches of industry interested Boulton , and it was his custom to found a special Company for every department of his work . We may anticipate our story by saying that he had hardly overcome the difficulties connected with the steam engine before he was interesting himself as an engineer in the improvement of minting money . Here he introduced new machines which worked so excellently that he equipped mints for a great number of European governments . James Watt later said quite rightly that Boulton would deserve a place of honour in the history of industry even if he had done nothing else than improve the minting of coins . Boulton 's great undertakings were known far beyond England . He never tired of showing off his factories , because he knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be instrumental in increasing his sales . He not only took visitors round his works , but was also a charming host at the house in Soho built specially for the purpose , and called by his friends the house of friendship . ' In August , 1767 , he wrote to his London representative : I had Lords and Ladies to wait on yesterday , I have French and Spaniards to-day ; and to-morrow I shall have Germans , Russians and Norwegians . ' The crowned heads of Europe also visited him and the Empress Catherine was his guest in 1776 . Princes , diplomats , artists , writers , and merchants all paid a visit to Soho . Such was the position of the man who now made himself responsible for James Watt 's invention . Boulton , the enterprising and tireless industrialist , took a great personal liking to James Watt , the quiet Scot with the crystal-clear mind . It is rare that two men have been so complementary to one another . Boulton , for whom no business could possibly be big enough , who found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote in 1770 to his friend Dr. Small : Nothing is more contrary to my disposition than bustling and bargaining with mankind ? yet that is the life I now constantly lead . Use and exertion render it rather more tolerable than it was at first , but it is still disagreeable . I am also in a constant fear that my want of experience may betray me into some scrape , or that I shall be imposed upon by the workmen , both which I take all the care my nature allows of to prevent . ' Then he goes on to complain of headaches and other ailments , which incapacitated him for days , and which only left him when an old man . Two years later he wrote to the same friend : I would rather face a loaded cannon than settle an account or make a bargain . In short I find myself out of my sphere when I have anything to do with mankind ; it is enough for an engineer to force Nature , and to bear the vexation of her getting the better of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coping with the great difficulties of practical // life . Here he needed the industrialist as a support , who took from off his shoulders the cares about earning money , and filled him with fresh courage when Watt thought that the ever-increasing load of debt would land him in prison . But if Boulton was now ready to let go the money owed him by Roebuck , if he could enter into the agreement with Watt under the same conditions , and while he was further ready to put down very large sums for the future development of this machine , it was necessary to prolong the life of Watt 's patent , which now had only eight years to run , to twenty-five years ? till i800 . An agreement with Roebuck was easily come to , for none of his creditors were ready , as Watt wrote , to give a penny for the patent for the steam engine . But the fight with the Patent Office in London was very difficult . Every kind of opposition was raised against monopoly ' . But Watt and his friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could only be obtained for developing so great an invention if there were a prospect of commercial success , for further improvements not contained in Watt 's patent might still be made , whereby all the work and money put into Watt 's invention would be sacrificed in vain . This risk had to be taken by the capitalist , and even a patent would not free him from them . To the great annoyance of all opponents , Watt 's very wide patent claim was extended for another twenty-five years . Boulton and Watt now made their agreement by which Boulton took over all costs and the whole of the business direction in return for two-thirds of the profits from the patent . Watt had in return for his third to design the machine , and to give his advice in erecting it and working it . It now seemed as if difficulties were at an end , but , so far from this being the case , the struggle went on . The constructional difficulties were scarcely to be overcome . No machine builders of the sort needed were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand is an art . When the great // ironfounder Wilkinson produced a steam cylinder accurate to one quarter of an inch , the feat excited astonishment . The construction of Watt 's steam engine demanded incomparably greater perfection in its construction , than that of the atmospheric engine of Newcomen . Accurately turned piston rods were now necessary , and the hitherto unknown stuffing-box had to be used ; at times it seemed as if Watt 's engine would , come to grief altogether in face of these difficulties in its manufacture . There were no machine shops such as we have to-day ; a machine was a thing built up like a house on the spot where it was to be used . Soho supplied only a few small parts , such as valves . Boulton and Watt acted as consulting engineers , and not as manufacturers . Watt produced the drawings , working at home , and helped in erecting and working the engine . For this he was paid at the rates customary at the time . But how was money to be made in this fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in . They said it was so complicated that it could never be kept in working order . But Boulton and Watt did not want to make and sell engines . They were satisfied to be paid a third of the value of the coal saved , as compared with the consumption of the existing atmospheric engine , stipulating only that the cylinders should be bored by Wilkinson . The mine owners were to pay this royalty year after year , as long as the patent lasted . They were at first very ready to make this arrangement , which could only result in a profit . But later , when the quite trustworthy Watt engine consumed only a quarter of the coal for the same output as compared with the old engine , they became angry at having to pay the yearly royalty . The monopoly was bitterly attacked ; it was said to be ruining the industry , and every attempt was made to get round the patent , a fact which aroused the greatest indignation in Watt . The result was embittered patent litigation , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day who is not willing to admit , as frequently io6 GREAT ENGINEERS happens , the great and decisive part played in the development of technology by the far-sighted capitalist , may learn much from this story of the steam engine . For there were still grave financial difficulties to overcome before a profit could be made . Boulton 's great metal works did not earn anything like as much as the steam engine cost . Heavy indebtedness was incurred . But Boulton 's faith in final victory was unshakable . He hung on . Boulton had to raise a sum of over ? 4o,000 , enormous for those days , before commercial success was attained . The invention began earning money only in 1785 , twenty years from its start . It was Cornwall , poor in coal and with deep mines , that paid . In 1783 , all steam engines in Cornwall had been replaced by those of Watt . Every one of these engines brought a very considerable yearly royalty to the firm . Watt could now be satisfied with his machine . He wished to confine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and again and again advised his friend Boulton to leave all new problems to young people who had neither money nor reputation to lose . But Boulton , the industrialist , was of a different opinion . The pumping engine business was not indefinitely expansible , but suppose it were possible to introduce this heat engine into factories and so replace the clumsy and feeble water-wheels and the muscular work of men and animals ? Boulton would have nothing to do with the view of some engineers , even some of great reputation , that the pumping engine could be used to raise water to drive a water-wheel . He pressed Watt with increasing urgency to build a steam engine giving rotary motion . But Watt hesitated , fearing a number of new great difficulties . But finally he set about the fresh task . He turned the existing single-acting machine into a double acting one , and replaced the chain by his wonderful link motion , the Watt parallelogram . But he was prevented by an English patent from applying the crank , a device which had long been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty by a new device . If we add to this that Watt // was perfectly clear about the economic importance of expansive working , and had already taken this possibility into his patent , and if we further recollect that he introduced the throttle valve for regulating the power and actuated it by a centrifugal governor , we have a picture of the machine as constructed by Watt . This machine was everywhere in the greatest demand ; people in London , Manchester , and Birmingham were mad after the steam engine , as we read in a travel story of those days . The construction of complete machines was begun in Soho , and it was scarcely possible to supply the demand . A means of measuring their power was now required , and since they were mostly used to replace horses , the natural thing was to measure their power in terms of the number of horses actually replaced . But not all horses give the same power , and so Watt came upon the idea of introducing a fixed unit . He introduced the horse-power unit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of electrotechnics was a new unit of power proposed , and this was given Watt 's name in his honour , so that to-day millions of people calculate daily in watts and kilowatts , without thinking of the fact that they are uttering with the name of this electrical unit , that of one of the greatest engineers of the world . Among the great collaborators acquired by Boulton and Watt , the Scotsman William Murdock deserves first mention . He was twenty-three years of age when he came from his native land and visited Watt . Boulton recognized his value , and engaged him . Murdock was a machine constructor of genius , and a type of man better able than Watt and Boulton to deal with the stubborn Cornish mine-owners . This big , quiet , meditative , and powerfully built Scot , who loved deeds rather than words , was successful in constructing the pumping engine , and in getting it to work . He lived for many years in the mining district of Cornwall . His life there was not made easy for him . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported that he laid the // foundation of the extraordinary esteem which he enjoyed in Cornwall by squaring up silently to the biggest talker who was attacking him and giving him a thorough beating amid the enthusiastic applause of the other mine-owners , who loved a fight . After that he was respected , and when anything was not in order , the call was for Murdock . He remained true to his firm in spite of the most dazzling offers from other sides . He improved the steam engine considerably after 1800 . He even built in Cornwall a small steam carriage , but the anxious Watt insisted that he should confine his attention to his pumping engine , not wanting to have his best man spend his energies on all sorts of farreaching plans . Murdock already made use of coal gas in Cornwall , and carried out the first gas lighting installation on a large scale in Soho on a national holiday in 1803 . He is rightly regarded as one of the pioneers of the generation and application of coal gas . He was at work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modest salary . We need more Murdocks ' were the words with which Boulton and Watt recognized the great value of his work for them . Murdock went on working in an important position after James Watt , up to 183o . He died in 1839 at the age of eighty-five . He lived to see the coming of the steamship and the railway . Let us return to James Watt . At the beginning of the nineteenth century the hard-fought patent for the steam engine expired . Watt rejoiced that this fact put an end to his business obligations , and could not endure another day in industry . Boulton , eight years older than Watt , was of quite a different nature , and had no idea of withdrawing from commercial activity . Rest , resignation from his life 's work , would have been for him equivalent to death , and though his advanced age with its infirmities warned him against excessive activity , and though Watt begged his friend again and again to take a rest , Boulton remained faithful till his death to the business which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sick bed in 1809 , from which // he was released by a peaceful death on August 17th . Watt , deeply moved by his death , wrote to his son and successor : Few men have had his abilities and still fewer have exerted them as he has done , and if to them we add his urbanity , his generosity , and his affection to his friends we shall make up a character rarely to be equalled . ' But James Watt , now at the age of sixty-four , free from material cares and better in health , rejoiced to be able to live according to his scientific and technical tastes in his modest home , where there was naturally a well-appointed workshop . He was not even able to refrain from inventing , but he would have nothing more to do with patents . The evening of his life lasted another nineteen years . Mentally vigorous , giving and taking ideas , he continued to take the closest interest in the further development of science and technology , art and literature . Anyone who was fortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who looked into his deep grey eyes , and heard his deep quiet voice with its strong Scottish accent , gained the impression , one to which contemporaries testified again and again , of a great , profound and modest genius , who was never tired of singing the praises of others , but who exclaimed to one of the friends who wished to write about him , Preserve the dignity of a philosopher and historian ; relate the facts , and leave posterity to judge . ' Posterity , when James Watt had passed away quietly on August 9th , 1819 , erected a monument to the great engineer in the venerable and world-renowned Abbey of Westminster , among kings , marshals , heroes , statesmen , and poets . The inscription states that the King , his minister , and many of the Lords and Commons of the realm erected this monument To JAMES WATT who directing the force of an original genius , early exercised in philosophic research to the improvement of the IIO GREAT ENGINEERS steam engine , enlarged the resources of his country , increased the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the most illustrious followers of science , and the real benefactors of the world . MASTERS OF THE MECHANICAL ARTS The eighteenth century gave us the steam engine through the agency of James Watt and his collaborators . The same period saw an England grown poor in wood replace it for iron smelting by her rich resources in coal . Among the great achievements in this field , we may recollect the work of the ironmasters Abraham Derby , father and son , and of the famous ironmaster and engineer John Wilkinson , whose portrait , painted by Watteau , is to be found in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum in Berlin . But especial importance attaches to the creative work of Henry Cort , who at the time when the first Watt steam engines were revolutionizing the driving of industrial plants , produced good wrought iron in the reverberatory furnace fired with coal , by means of the puddling process . When one remembers that up to the time of Cort 's invention , English wrought iron was so poor in quality that it could not be used in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweden and Russia ? we recognize what this deed meant for England . Lord Sheffield said in 1786 that the inventions which England owed to James Watt and Henry Cort more than compensated for the loss of America , for England became , by the achievement of her engineers , the superior of all other countries in the production and application of iron . But in the eighteenth century , almost simultaneously with the discovery of the steam engine , men of the most humble origin succeeded in introducing machines into the technology MASTERS OF THE MECHANICAL ARTS i i i of textiles . Arkwright , Hargreaves , and Crompton replaced the work of the sensitive human hand in spinning by ingeniously constructed parts of machines . These machines were then soon mechanically driven , first by water-wheels and then by steam engines . Soon the new machines were able to spin much more yarn than the old hand looms were able to take . Then a clergyman , Edmund Cartwright ( 1743-1823 ) , developed the machine-driven loom in 1785 . The spinning machines were now unable to produce enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long time until spinning and weaving were again adjusted to one another . In France , an inventor of genius , Joseph Maire Jacquard ( 1752-1834 ) , made numerous inventions in the textile field , which were of especial importance as regards the weaving of patterns . The result was an enormous expansion of the English textile industry . It was here that the modern factory system came into being . It was here that men were first trained on a large scale to working in a way determined by machines . Here , too , the hatred of the man-conquering machine arose : a hatred first expressed in the sharpest revolutionary forms in England by the revolt of those directly affected against inventors , engineers , and machine owners . Much could be told of the men who were responsible for these achievements . Of Arkwright , who finally gained the day after the fiercest struggle , and died one of the richest men in England ; of Crompton , the gentle idealist , who allowed himself to be deceived by promises and lost almost the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , was a human destiny closely interwoven with the machine created by it . When kings build , there is work for carters . In technology also , there are a few real kings , who by their achievements exercise a decisive influence on the development of their times . But the execution of their plans , their application in all sorts of directions and in the most diverse countries , II2 GREAT ENGINEERS demand a multitude of workers . Of the work of these men we have a detailed account in the history of technology , but their lives , as far as posterity is concerned , are spent without leaving a trace in their work . The battles of technology can not be fought by generals alone ; privates are needed as well . The engineers of the eighteenth century were given the most varied professional designations . The methodical education and training of our days was unknown . Mining , at once the greatest stimulus and source of orders for engineering , had its master technicians . The machines used for raising water and ore to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could build and run such works of art was called the Master of Arts . This fine term for the profession , Kunstmeister , has been kept till to-day in Germany . The machines used in the art of mining are characterized by reciprocatory motion . Mills , on the other hand , are revolving mechanisms , and in English the word mill was used for all rotary motions ; in England we speak of cotton mills and so on . Here we have the mill builder , the ' millwright , ' the man who long ago worked his way up from the ranks of the handicraftsmen , and , without a place in the craft guilds , had to do everything connected with building and running mills for the most varied purposes . We owe to the great English engineer William Fairbairn , who himself came from among them , a valuable contribution to the professional history of this same class of the old engineers . The millwright of former days was to a great extent the sole representative of mechanical art , and was looked upon as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under whatever conditions they were to be used , as a motive power for the purposes of manufacture . He was the engineer of the district in which he worked with equal facility at the lathe , the anvil , or the carpenter 's bench . ' The millwright of the eighteenth century carried on his // trade as engineer and mechanic peripatetically . He lived far from the town , in the heart of the country , and usually relied completely on his own resources . As Fairbairn says , he could calculate the velocities , strength , and power of machines : could draw in plan and section , and could construct buildings , conduits ; or water-courses , in all the forms and under all the conditions required in his professional practice ; he could build bridges , cut canals , and perform a variety of work now done by civil engineers . ' Fairbairn considers these country millwrights to be some of the most useful and independent men who have ever worked technically . However , he was well aware of his own achievements , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JACOB LEUPOLD 1674 ? 1727 But who then were called mechanics ? Here again it is naturally impossible to draw a sharp line of division , for these professional designations were not titles protected by law , and acquired by examination ; but as regards the mechanic and the work he was required to do , Jacob Leupold gives us a very exact picture of the situation in the first half of the eighteenth century . He himself considered himself a member of this class . He was born in 1674 in Planitz near Zwickau , and died in Leipzig in 1727 . His fame has lasted into our day by reason of his great work Theatrum Machinarum , which is one of the most voluminous technical works in the German language . The Latin title is in the language of the learned , but it is translated as exposition of the foundations of mechanical science . ' The first volume appeared in Leipzig in 1724 . The whole work has the stately dimensions of 1,764 pages and 472 full-page copper engravings . Seven volumes appeared in Leupold 's lifetime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by a supplementary volume twelve years later . Anyone desirous of becoming acquainted with the achievements of machine , instrument , hydraulic , and bridge construction at the beginning of the eighteenth century has here the source of information to hand . By studying Leupold he is able to penetrate into the knowledge and mode of thought of the engineers of that time . He will find , again and again , how valuable a service is performed by presenting the knowledge necessary at a certain period in daily professional life , in simple language understandable by everyone . Leupold 's father was a craftsman with skill in a number of different trades . The son was to follow in his footsteps , but he was physically too frail for heavy work , and hence he was allowed to study . He went to the famous school of learning in Zwickau , thence to the Universities of Jena , and later Wittenberg . Here he wished to study theology , but the poor student could not live by studying , and hence he had to think about going back home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt at Leipzig , where he succeeded in giving private lessons , and also in instructing masons and carpenters in the civil building art . ' But this business of teaching drove him from his studies . He needed applied mathematics for the lessons which he was giving , and he had qualms of conscience about giving up his study of sacred learning . Here a sensible clergyman helped him to overcome them by pointing out that there were enough preachers in Leipzig , but no workers in the arts with mathematical and physical knowledge . So in 1699 , Leupold determined to open a mechanical workshop at Leipzig . He succeeded some years later in considerably improving the air pump , and he then carried on his workshop with varying success . He raised his own status to such an extent that Prussia gave him the title of Commercien-Rath , ' Councillor for Commerce . He was made a member of learned societies , and in 1724 the first volume appeared of the work to which we have // referred , and which laid the foundations of a fame lasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he has not written the book for the learned , who would certainly know better than he on all points , and had the opportunity of studying existing writings ; he has had in mind artists , craftsmen , and such persons as have no command of foreign languages or other studies , and have no opportunity of making use of " informatores " and other aids , or of seeking out from so many writings what is necessary , and are nevertheless more than anyone in need of these foundations , not out of curiosity , but because they are actually using such machines , and even have to build them and apply them . ' Leupold tells us also on the first page of his work his conception of a mechanic : but a mechanic ( of whom we are here talking ) ought to be a person who not only understands well and thoroughly all handicrafts , such as wood , steel , iron , brass , silver , gold , glass , and all such materials to be treated according to the arts , and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each according to its nature and property is adequate or suitable to withstand and endure this or that , so that everything receives its necessary proportion , strength , and convenience , and neither too much nor too little is done in the matter ; but he must also be able to arrange according to mechanical sciences or rules for any required proportion , or effect according to present or proposed force or load ; for which purpose he must also have learned from geometry and arithmetic all that is necessary for calculation of the parts of the machine . And when he desires thoroughly to understand his profession , he must have a complete grasp of all the arts and professions for which he will have to make and invent machines ; for otherwise he knows not what he is doing , and has also no power to improve anything , or invent anything new , such as is chiefly demanded of a mechanic . But above all he has to be a born mechanic , so that he shall not only be skilled in invention by // natural instinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sciences , in such a way that it may be said of him : what his eyes see , that also are his hands able to do ; and that love of his art lets him avoid no trouble , labour , or cost , because throughout his whole life he has daily to learn something new and to experiment . ' We also learn from Leupold that a distinction was made at that time between a mechanicus ' and a machinarius . ' According to him , a machinarius is the man who invents the machine , while the mechanicus is he who is able himself to make machines and instruments , and so has a very good knowledge of handicraft . But Leupold makes the observation , very true in his time , that both are so closely connected that it is rare for one to accomplish anything without the other . The great mathematicians , he says , were often very unfortunate with their inventions , because they had no knowledge of handicrafts . FRIEDRICH WILHELM HOLTZHAUSEN and FRANZ DINNENDAHL 1768 ? 1827 &; 1775 ? 1826 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attainments in the century after Leupold . These are the Masters of Arts Holtzhausen , who came from the Harz , and built his great machines in Upper Silesia ; and Dinnendahl , who , born of the humblest parents , became a great master in Essen in the west . The problem was to introduce steam power into Germany , and the great King of Prussia , Frederick II , stands at the head of this development . In 178o , the king , a great promoter of industry in his state , had ordered his minister , the Freiherr von Heinitz , to give his attention to the heat engine , which could be used in all mines to get the // water out , ' but the minister was further , above and beyond this special task , to make use of the steam engine whereever it could be applied usefully and effectively . It was necessary to take a lesson from England . The minister therefore decided to send specially gifted mine officials into the Promised Land of technology ; they were to study the English machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Watt 's steam engine . One especially successful mining engineer was Carl Friedrich Buckling , who was born on July 23rd , 1750 , at Ruppin , the son of a merchant . Buckling had a good education . He was at first trained for building , but later he took up mining and smelting . He was sent together with four colleagues , the first Prussian mining men , to the newly founded School of Mines at Freiberg . An essential part of education in those days was travelling for study . Buckling had in 1780 visited England and the Scandinavian countries , commissioned by the minister . When he came back , he constructed , with the help of two mechanics in Berlin , a working model of a Watt steam engine . He thereupon got the order to erect a steam engine in Hettstadt in the neighbourhood of Mansfeld . But the task was not so easy to carry out . He had to go once again to England . He travelled over the famous mining district of Cornwall , where he succeeded , in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine master by the name of Richard for the Prussian mining industry . On August 23rd , 1785 , the first steam engine was put into regular industrial use in Hettstadt . It was the first steam engine made of German materials by German workmen . Its importance was recognized loo years after it started to work by the Verein deutscher Ingenieure , which erected a monument on the spot where it had worked . Buckling also built a whole series of machines , including boring machines and lathes . He died at Berlin , on February 22nd , 1812 , highly esteemed and appreciated in his own line of work . // It was Upper Silesia , however , which attained the greatest importance in technical work for the Germany of those days . Frederick the Great found helpers of genius in Freiherr von Heinitz and Count von Reden , for whom it was a work after their own heart to carry out the great task entrusted to them by their sovereign in Upper Silesia , which hitherto had been completely neglected . Count Reden wrote in 1786 : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster circulation , and culture will raise this unconsidered corner to the rank of a jewel in the Prussian crown , and will turn its inhabitants from poor oppressed slaves into educated and happy men and women . ' Heinitz and Reden knew that this was only possible by the aid of the new technology . The first steam engine was ordered from England for Tarnowitz . This was the engine , perhaps the only one , seen by Goethe . When on a journey with his Grand Duke to Upper Silesia , he was taken by Reden to look at this machine , and while under the impression made by it , he wrote in the visitor 's book : To the company at Tarnowitz , 4th of September 1790 . Far from educated men , at the bounds of the Empire , who shall help you To find treasures and to bring them with success to the daylight ? Only wisdom and honesty help ; these two Are the keys to every treasure in the earth 's possession . ' But these men needed help , and they found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was highly recommended to Count Reden as having a good head for mechanics . Holtzhausen was born on March 4th , 1768 , at Ellrich in the Southern Harz . In 1790 he learned mining and machine construction at Andreasberg . It was Buckling who gave him the possibility of becoming acquainted with the first steam engine in Hettstadt , but Reden sent him as early as 1792 to build steam engines in Upper // Silesia . The twenty-four-year-old engineer now set about energetically building steam engines , without which the development of Upper Silesian mining was impossible . Three steam plants were under his control . Holtzhausen began to build new steam engines under the most difficult circumstances imaginable , using only the simplest and roughest tools , and with the help of entirely untrained workmen . The parts were first made at the smelting works at Malapane , and later at Gleiwitz . In 18o8 he was made machine inspector and manager of the machine works laid down in18o6 at the Gleiwitz smelting works . At the same time all steam engines of the Upper Silesian mining and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under his control . German engineers pay him homage as one of the greatest of their professional forerunners . Holtzhausen and his co-workers made Upper Silesia in those days into the cradle of German machine construction . The building of steam engines spread thence all over Germany , and the first steam engine used in the industrial district of the west came from Upper Silesia . Built by Holtzhausen , it was set going in 1801 at the Zeche Vollmond at Langendreer . The machine house for it was built by a carpenter , Franz Dinnendahl , who on this occasion received his first incentive to the building of steam engines . FRANZ DINNENDAHL 1775 ? 1826 Dinnendahl 's father was the miller at the Horster Muhle , near Steele , which to-day is part of the town of Essen . Here Franz Dinnendahl was born on August loth , 1775 . Perhaps the mill itself made on the child an impression which determined his future career ; be that as it may , he refers again and again in his autobiography , which unhappily was Ito GREAT ENGINEERS never finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in his blood . He wanted to become a master of arts , ' or as he later liked to call himself , a mechanicus . ' But how was a poor miller 's son on a lonely mill to find and travel the road to an art which had hardly yet received a name ? Dinnendahl referred to the simple village school , in which he managed to learn by his twelfth year a little reading and writing , as a miserable school ' ; then came the necessity to earn money . Dinnendahl himself , when telling the story of his life , loved to describe how he had had to work his way up from small beginnings . He was very proud at having risen by his own powers , and he tells us that though he had to start by tending swine , he never forgot his irresistible leanings to mechanics . ' Thus , while looking after his pigs , he cut out all sorts of models of little machines , with the consequence that he brought home at night barely half the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be excused for having dismissed young Dinnendahl as unsuited to the business . ' Young Dinnendahl now tried his hand at mining , and at sixteen had himself enrolled as a miner . He made the acquaintance of all the necessary operations , which was an advantage later when he had to make mining machinery . But here as well he got no nearer to the goal which he had set himself . An uncle advised him to become a carpenter . Wood was at that time the most important material used in machines , and a builder might in this way quite well become a mechanicus . ' Young Dinnendahl loved variety , and so he laid aside mining and went to a village cabinet-maker , who was also a carpenter , to learn the trade . He kept at it for scarcely a year , when he had learned , as he thought , enough . He was lent fifteen reichsthalers to buy tools , and Dinnendahl then began to build everything he could get orders for . Still , he was all the time pondering new ideas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he had no money , and at first no one would entrust him with any FRANZ DINNENDAHL I2I construction . At last someone was sufficiently courageous to order from him a modest wooden house . Others followed this example , and in a few years he had built ten houses and some sheds . These were hard times for him . He had to put in sixteen to seventeen hours daily , including what was often a long journey , in order to earn the barest necessities . But as he tells us , his passion for machinery was strong enough to keep him designing his machines far into the night , though he no doubt found time to think about them when at his work . Finally he received from the farmer who owned the coal-mine in Kupferdreh , an order to build a waterlifting machine . He now learned drawing and succeeded in getting running not only the machine ordered , but also a hand-driven hoisting engine to the amazement of the public . ' And then , as we have already seen , he built in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had come from Upper Silesia , the first in Westphalia . The machine master did not quite know how to deal with the machine and Dinnendahl thought he knew better . His advice was sharply rejected , for what could a simple carpenter be expected to know about the highest achievement of machinery of the day ? Finally he got a hearing from the owner of the mine , Freiherr von Romberg . He never afterwards failed to remember that this nobleman , though I came to him in a linen smock , and had never had any personal acquaintance with him before , did not repel me with indifference , but at once saw my value . ' Dinnendahl was then allowed to take a hand in getting the machine erected . People began to have confidence in him , and one here and there began to believe in his mechanical genius . ' The hand-worked pumping apparatus built by him for the Wohlgemut mine near Essen no longer sufficed , and Dinnendahl was asked to build a heat engine . It was got going in 1803 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very important milestone in Dinnendahl 's professional career was passed . He who would raise water by fire , had to be an excellent master of arts . But what difficulties had to be overcome by an engineer of those times ! Let Dinnendahl tell us of them in his own words . It was in truth a weighty undertaking , the more so because there was not even a smith in this neighbourhood who could make a proper screw , let alone produce other forged parts needed for the machine , such as valve gear , piston rod , boiler work , and so on , or could do boring and turning . I myself was trained in carpenters and joiners work ; but I had now to undertake smithing without having learned it . However , I did almost all the ironwork on the machine with my own hands , even the boiler , so that for a year and a half I did hardly any work but smithing , and so made good myself the absence of such craftsmen . But there were also no sheet iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which reason the plates of the first boiler were almost all imperfect and cold-short . Equally defective were those parts of the machine which the ironworks had to supply , such as cylinders , steampipes , pumps , pistons , and the like . This difficulty also was overcome , for with the help of my own ideas and the skill of Herr Jacobi , owner of the ironworks at Sterkrade , I got this firm to the point of supplying all necessary parts of an engine , at first , it is true , imperfectly , but now as good as they can be made . The boring of the cylinder put fresh obstacles in my way , but even they did not daunt me ; I built myself a boring machine without ever having seen one . And so at last I overcame untold difficulties and got so far as completing the first engine according to the old principle . ' His name was soon known far and wide . He was called to Aix-la-Chapelle to build an engine . He was to get 5,000 reichsthalers for a machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be an atmospheric engine , but in the meantime Dinnendahl had learned of the great advance // made by James Watt . He determined to show that he could build an engine according to the new principle . Such an engine would naturally cost considerably more , and he knew that the agreed sum of 5,000 reichsthalers would not even suffice for the old type . But , ' he writes , my courage did not even then desert me ; all these circumstances were rather a spur to new exertions . ' First he built the engine on the old principle . He was careful to guard against losing my credit at the start . ' The machine was a complete success , and now he had the courage to convert it to the new principle . To everyone 's satisfaction , the engine now ran as a Watt low-pressure engine . We read in his autobiography : The joy I had in seeing that the machine likewise did its duty is beyond my powers of description . ' This great joy over the success of a daring step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiety which fall to the lot of every technical pioneer . At about the time that Dinnendahl was working in Westphalia , we hear of a master Scharl , who had to build the great water-wheel for a brewery in Munich . The story then runs : This great wheel caused the builder , Scharl , many sleepless nights , he read , he studied , he asked mathematicians , mechanics ; he calculated , experimented , altered and altered again , until at last , after a great expenditure of thought , money and time , it was set up , and the joy of the inventor may be guessed from a phrase , written in capitals , in one of his letters : FRIENDS , AT LAST THE GREAT WHEEL IS WORKING ! ' In 1806 Dinnendahl built for the coal-mine Salzer and Neuack near Essen a pumping engine with a 40 in. cylinder . The Office of Mines called the proprietors together , and Dinnendahl put before them a new and unheard-of proposal . He wanted to build not only a pumping engine , but also a steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one boiler . He got the order . He was to get 12,800 reichsthalers for the two machines . Dinnendahl now became a mechanicus , ' and gave up I24 GREAT ENGINEERS carpentering and joining . He went to Essen and set up a machine works . The new machine gave rise to great difficulties . The Gutehoffnungshutte took eleven months to make a satisfactory cylinder of the required dimensions . It had to be cast five times , and made in three parts , for the capacity of the furnace was not sufficient for the cylinder . The engine was set to work in 1809 . Dinnendahl 's achievements were soon known far beyond Westphalia . Even the Emperor Napoleon gave him orders . A fort had to be built in the greatest haste at the fortress of Wesel ; horse machines were not adequate , and Dinnendahl could not build a steam engine in time . But he succeeded in getting one from England . His work was so satisfactory that he received an order for a like plant in Metz . The political position changed , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Wesel had at last made some money for him . It is said that in those days whole casks full of hard thaler pieces stood in the entrance to his house , and being the man he was , he must have had the greatest joy in being able to give his fellow citizens so striking a demonstration of his wealth . Dinnendahl had reached the pinnacle of his life and success . He established close personal and business relations with Gottlob Jacobi in Sterkrade , with the great German industrialist Friedrich Harkort in Wetter , and with Friedrich Krupp , father of the great Alfred Krupp . He let Krupp 's children share the teaching given to his children by his secretary and tutor Sartorius . Dinnendahl even made a gas-lighting installation for his factory , long before the first gasworks was built in Germany by Englishmen . A friend of Dinnendahl 's , a pharmacist in Essen , had made coal gas in his laboratory , and shown this curious light to his friends . Dinnendahl , delighted by every technical advance , determined to light his works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flickering of the light , he put in a gasholder . The journal Hermann gave an enthusiastic // report of the success of this lighting installation , under date March 27th , 1818 . The first eight or ten days the courtyard of the works was full of sightseers every evening , who cheered Dinnendahl in their enthusiasm for the new and beautiful light . He then went on building engines , the largest being for the coal-mine Kunstwerk in Steele , of which Dinnendahl says in a communication to the Chief Office of Mines , that this work is unique of its kind , at least in this neighbourhood . ' Dinnendahl 's achievements were known outside Germany . Thus he was applied to from Holland to build ten great steam engines with all accessories , which were to be used to pump out at long last the Haarlem lake . He answered that ' he felt himself equal to the task of taking over the business and carrying it through to everyone 's satisfaction . ' This vast undertaking attracted him , but the Dutch made it clear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profit of two millions , or even much more , might result . Dinnendahl wanted to negotiate directly with one of the leading Dutch Ministers . But he had not the courage to risk a million on his own account for land reclamation . Thus the negotiations dragged on , Dinnendahl being well aware that the machines alone would not accomplish the work . The engines were the least part of it , and the work of the drainage engineers would cost an enormous amount . When he was advised not to demand cash , but to accept payment in the form of shares in the reclaimed land , he was unable , he said , to agree , because he had not the money to carry out the work . Dinnendahl considered it necessary to set up his own foundry , the more so because the Gutehoffnungshutte had started , in 1819 , to compete with him in steam engines . After his factory in Essen was destroyed by fire , he combined the new building with a foundry . But competition now began to make itself felt more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1819 // for building engines on English lines . Worst of all , Dinnendahl had proved himself too optimistic in his business undertakings . He had taken shares in mining ventures ; he was no doubt compelled to do this in order to get orders . But now these business ventures began to show heavy losses . The money he earned he lost again ; the poverty of his early years threatened to return . He was no longer able to take up the struggle . He died on August 15th , 1826 , at the age of fifty-one . In 1936 , the town of Essen gave him a tomb in its cemetery of honour , after his resting-place in Steele had been absorbed by an enlargement of the town . Dinnendahl , like so many other technical pioneers , was of the humblest possible origin . A characteristic of his was his faith in his own powers . His enthusiasm gave him an enormous capacity for work . He was stimulating and attractive in personal intercourse . Full of temperament , fresh and decisive in his manner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too far , and made personal dealings with him difficult . He found it especially hard to manage officials . So he complains in his autobiography how unpleasant it had been for him when I had to see myself delivered over hand and foot to the ignorance and arbitrariness of an official body . ' It was no doubt more especially the middle class of official that made trouble for him , for they believed in their own omniscience , and saw in Dinnendahl an upstart . What indeed was to be thought , in those days when authority was a superstition , of a man who went so far as not only to think , but to say : Ministers and state officials are not at all times the cleverest people ' ? But this struggle with officialdom was much to the taste of Dinnendahl 's fellow citizens , who had not themselves the courage to stand up for their own opinions against the authorities . He stood up for his own people and never forgot how much his success depended on their collaboration . One of the simple songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a works festival , has come down to us . In this the pride of Dinnendahl 's men and their joy in their work and their master , is expressed in a manner which warms the heart . But they also remember to thank Madame Dinnendahl for the French brandy and beer which she had given them : Vergnugen , Lust , and Plasier Gesellen Dinnendahls sind wir . ' And so we catch an echo of the joy and love of life of Dinnendahl and his men , specially necessary in technical work when a great and new advance has to be made in face of all difficulties . Dinnendahl was one of the pioneers , and for us he is a path-finder on the road of technical progress , for he added important material to the structure of German technology and industry . GEORG FRIEDRICH REICHENBACH 1771 ? 1826 Georg Friedrich Reichenbach came of a family of well-todo artisans . His grandfather was a mechanic in the Mint at Mannheim , his father was a master mechanic , who had worked his way up to the grade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master mason . His father had migrated from the Palatinate to Durlach in Baden , because he hoped to get on more quickly there , and here his son Georg was born to him on August 24th , 1771 . When he was two years old , his father moved to Mannheim , and became , in close competition with others , the manager of the great cannon-boring works , thanks to his great manual skill . He had much work to do ; the army made great demands , and technical output had to be increased again and again . He was given the opportunity of looking round everywhere ; he went to Hanover and got acquainted there with the latest English work ; he had to work in Munich . He was allowed to add to his modest salary by accepting private // orders . So Reichenbach pere did not spend much time at home , and paid little attention to his child 's schooling , the more so because Georg , in his early years , did not seem to promise much . At that time the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no aptitude for it and was never much use at it . On the other hand , he loved all the more everything to do with mathematics and science , and so the opinion of his teachers finally changed for the better . He succeeded at fourteen in getting into the Military School at Mannheim , at that time known as the Chief School of Genius . ' Here young Reichenbach began to acquire many friends . He was short , he had dark brown hair and steelblue eyes , a high forehead . He was a joyous man of the Palatinate , lively , enthusiastic for everything that attracted him , and never forgot in the midst of his work to enjoy life . The early careers of father and son were much the same , both received commissions , both became captains . In their professions , they were both advanced from Untermechanicus ' to Obermechanicus . ' In addition to the knowledge he gained at school , he acquired in his father 's workshop the latter 's great practical skill ; thus was laid one of the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry out what Reichenbach 's brain had conceived , and we know from his life that he always set to work with his own hands when the highest accuracy was needed for his famous instruments . Another important part of Reichenbach 's education was the two journeys to England which the King of Bavaria made possible for him at the suggestion of Count Rumford , who at that time was engaged in Munich in successful technical and scientific work . A determining factor in Reichenbach 's career was the fact that when still at the Military School he chanced to become acquainted with the astronomer at the Mannheim Observatory . Here the cadet got a knowledge of mathematical instruments hitherto strange to him , and his ambition // was aroused to test his own manual skill by attempting to construct similar instruments in his father 's workshop . He was allowed to try his hand , and the Director of the Observatory , Abbe Barry , who wanted to help his young friend , sent a sextant made by Reichenbach to Count Rumford with the warmest recommendations . He then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , and more important still , the best possible introductions to Watt and Boulton in Soho , for he was commissioned to order a Watt steam engine for the town of Munich . He was nineteen years of age , and had not been much out of Munich . For him a journey to England meant more than does for us a journey in a fast liner to America . At the same time as Reichenbach another young Bavarian engineer , Joseph Baader , who was eight years older and already knew England , also wanted to journey to the Promised Land of technology . It was thus natural for Count Rumford to entrust young Reichenbach , who had never been abroad and knew no English , to the guidance of Baader . This acquaintance with Baader caused Reichenbach all his life much worry and unhappiness , for Baader inherited from his father an excessive desire for prominence , and if possible developed it still farther . He was an excellent speaker , and understood how to make his presence felt . Backed by all that he had seen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he alone in Germany understood anything of technology , and persecuted with biting criticism everyone who achieved anything in the same field independently of himself . So Baader is not a very attractive figure in the technical history of those times . The determination to get one 's own way at all costs is a challenge to criticism , and it now seems that there is little left of all his plans , specially as regards the introduction of the railway . In any case he could not prevent the rise of Reichenbach , but he caused him many unhappy hours , for there were few who dared to take up the cudgels seriously with Baader. // They knew his method of fighting and preferred to come to a peaceful arrangement with him whenever possible . This was impossible in Reichenbach 's case , for Baader always showed a passionate dislike for him . Reichenbach 's first stay in England lasted from June 1st , 1791 , to January , 1792 . He then went home for a short time , returning to England for over a year . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his earliest acquaintance , was not very pleased over Reichenbach 's intention to work with him . But since he brought with him an order for a steam engine , he could not well object . It was now Reichenbach 's task to learn as much as possible about building steam engines . His diary tells us something of these first weeks . He was glad that he soon got to know Mr. Watt . We learn further how every endeavour was made to keep things secret from him . By giving some small tips , he tried to hear and see at least a little . At his inn he attempted to make drawings in secret of all he had seen and heard . This work cost me indescribable trouble , for the reason that not only could I not ask anyone anything , but dare not for fear of arousing suspicion ; all I was allowed was to see them from time to time . ' Young Reichenbach nevertheless succeeded in making a careful drawing of the machine , and in describing the boiler and engine very accurately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Soho , for Count Rumford had cancelled the order at the threat of war , and Reichenbach had to leave . He then went on to work as an engineer in managerial positions in large English ironworks , and during this time built quite independently a large blowing engine . Reichenbach received very good testimonials from the English : his abilities were said to be deserving of every support , and Mr. Reichenbach was specially commended to the Elector of Bavaria . He also used his stay in England to study as far as possible English instrument making , which at that time was famous all over the world . GEORG FRIEDRICH REICHENBACH iii At the end of May , 1793 , Reichenbach went home again from Edinburgh via Rotterdam . His diary tells us that he examined the Electoral fortress in Dusseldorf . But it was the collection of pictures there that roused his enthusiasm most . In Remscheid he examined the smithies producing war material . A wide range of military duties awaited him at home . It was a warlike time , and one had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military workshops of Mannheim and Munich , and here it was chiefly Reichenbach pere whose aid was called for . He received as a recognition of his achievements a gold medal for the only boring machine in Europe so well constructed . ' His father had also been concerned in directing the construction of the Amberg Small-arms Factory , and in equipping the foundry and boring mill put up in Augsburg in 1806 . He died in 182o as Lieutenant-General of Artillery , and a much admired mechanicus . ' Georg Reichenbach had made for the Austrians , at the time when the French were besieging Mannheim , bomb mortars with a long range . In 1796 he came with the rest of the Electoral Bavarian troops to Munich . Here he set to work on the making of his famous mathematical instruments , though military tasks had to be carried out at the same time . He made a rifled breech-loading gun , but it did not find favour ; people were not ready to depart from custom . Further experiments seemed to him too costly an undertaking . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems of instrument making occupied him more and more completely . He therefore determined in 1811 to ask the King to accept his resignation from the army , in order to be able to devote all my strength more to mechanics and science , and never again to be diverted by the inevitable details of military service . ' The chief foundation of Reichenbach 's great successes in instrument making was the invention of the dividing engine . I le has himself told us how this technical advance was // only achieved after much thought and great trouble . Many hundreds of plans , ideas , and experiments to improve the circular dividing engine died immediately after birth . ' When in quarters during the campaign of July , 1800 , he discovered the extremely simple principle of his dividing engine , and he goes on to tell us to what a degree the graduation , hitherto carried out by means of the compass , was dependent on the material , however exact the work . Measurements made in this way were quite unable to give the accuracy required . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in attempting to beat the great English instrument-maker Ramsden , whose method of graduation was known to him . After much cogitation , ' he tells us , ( for in such matters the simplest solution usually occurs to us last of all ) , I at last extracted the fundamental principle that a perfect graduation can only be obtained when it is carried out without any previous visible marks drawn as divisions between the given limit , so making it as it were in the air , before the lines of division are drawn : and in stating this basic idea we have given the main principle of my new method of graduation . ' When he set to work to carry his invention into effect , many difficulties had to be overcome . At this point no doubt he owed much to Liebherr , a man trained as a watch-maker , and very skilful with his hands , whose acquaintance Reichenbach had made and whom he had taken as partner . Later on there was a quarrel between these two men , but even if we admit that Liebherr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical feat remains to the credit of Reichenbach when the discovery is carefully examined . Thereupon he went to work to found in Munich , as had long been his intention , workshops for mathematical instruments . The Benedictine Professor Ulrich Schiegg from Wurttemberg , who was for a time Astronomer in Munich , gave him great support in this undertaking . He caused the Academy of Sciences to grant him 600 gulden for his // workshops . Schiegg also recommended his instruments to the government authorities . Very soon the excellence of his machines made them known beyond the confines of Bavaria , and in 1803 , the King of Bavaria granted him an honorarium of 6o louis d'or in recognition of his valuable services as a mechanic . An important matter was that he got into contact with Joseph von Utzschneider . Utzschneider was at home in many fields of work , and was particularly desirous of encouraging trade and industry . Mainly , as he said , because they were calculated ' to advance the prosperity of all , and not the wealth of individuals . ' Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as later in Fraunhofer . On August 20th , 18o4 , Reichenbach , Utzschneider and Liebherr formed themselves into a company with the object of running a mathematical and mechanical institute . Reichenbach was to take over the whole technical and scientific direction . He had to design the instruments , and to carry out with his own hands all work demanding the highest perfection . Liebherr was to be the first foreman . Utzschneider agreed to attend to finance and to be the business head of the institute . In the meantime Napoleon had closed the frontiers of the Continent , optical glass could no longer be obtained from England , and it thus became necessary to incorporate an optical workshop in the undertaking . For this , Utzschneider succeeded in discovering the glassmaker 's apprentice Joseph Fraunhofer , whose value was also recognized by Reichenbach : ' that is the man we are seeking ; he will supply us with what we are lacking . ' And so Fraunhofer began to calculate and grind the glasses produced in the new works at Benediktbeuren . The optical part of Reichenbach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reichenbach continued to be engaged in other work as well . I le set up a mathematical workshop in Vienna , and in conjunction with a very capable mechanic , Ertel , inaugurated in Munich the mathematico-mechanical institute // of Reichenbach and Ertel , which also obtained its glasses from Benediktbeuren . If we seek to form a picture of Reichenbach 's great attainments in the field of geodetic and astronomical instruments , we must recognize how this great German engineer , a master held in high esteem far beyond the confines of Germany , created monuments of mechanical art . His theodolites were famous . He worked out a model which thoroughly proved its work in the trigonometrical survey of Germany undertaken in the ' forties . Indeed , the essential design has remained unchanged until to-day . The Deutsche Museum affords wonderful examples of Reichenbach 's achievements . Gauss said of these theodolites made in Munich , that they were being used for the most accurate measurements of angles on the Earth . Gauss himself was an enthusiastic admirer of Reichenbach 's instruments , the importance of which no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter in March , 1813 , Gauss writes joyfully to one of his collaborators : ' We have two splendid Reichenbach instruments , ' and he stresses the fact that the measurements hitherto made at the observatory with the theodolites prove that it is an unbeatable instrument . ' He admires the fineness and exactitude of the scaling , the almost incredible sensitivity of the levels , the perfection of the telescopes and the accuracy and beauty of finish of all the individual parts . Reichenbach was right in valuing very highly an opinion from such a source . It was of Gauss that Reichenbach said , If he wants a divided circle from me , I will do it for nothing . ' He felt the best work of his head and his hands to be so closely bound up together , that he thought more of how he could be of service to science with his instruments , than of how he could earn money . Hence he took special pains to see that his instruments came into good hands . The famous Frenchman Laplace gave him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He calls the astronomical instrument , in a letter to Reichenbach , the most // perfect astronomical instrument in existence . Again and again , contemporary reports praise these astronomical tools as the most perfect ever built by human hands . An important source of income of the State of Bavaria was salt , which was produced in the salt-pans by the evaporation of brine . Salt had been prepared for over i , 000 years in the neighbourhood of Reichenhall , Traunstein , and Berchtesgaden . For 200 years apparatus for bringing the brine to the boiler-house had been in use . In these two centuries , machines of the period had done valuable work . The Bavarian directorate of the salt mines had now to cope with new and great problems . Reichenbach , who in reality was only incidentally a renowned instrument maker , but in his chief capacity was a member of the Advisory Council of the Bavarian Crown for the salt works , was selected to deal with these new problems . First of all a pipe-line for the brine had to be built from Reichenhall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But now came the really great task , that of sending the brine from Berchtesgaden to Reichenhall , passing over only Bavarian territory . The distance was shorter , but the task was uncommonly difficult , for Reichenbach determined to force 44 gallons a minute to a height of 1,218 ft. in one throw . Here , as in the former case , only water was available as motive power , and there was only a small amount available , with a high fall . What machine was to be used ? The water-power would not be sufficient if used with the low-efficiency water-wheels of that day . Reichenbach now remembered the water-column machines of the Hungarian mechanic Hell . These were piston-engines , in which the head of water acted on the piston as does the pressure of steam in the steam engine . He had no intention of simply copying these machines , but designed new ones on this principle , which , however , called for considerably better workmanship and mastery of mechanics than the waterwheels . At this point , his great experience of accurate work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knowledge of the manufacture of cannon was also most valuable . When his old opponent Baader ridiculed him as the instrument maker who knew , in his opinion , nothing at all about building real machines , the opposite was in fact the truth . The skilled workmen of his mechanical institute also helped to overcome difficulties . The first eight water piston-engines were copied from double-acting steam engines , the power being transmitted directly to the pump without the intervention of gear of any sort . Reichenbach 's experience with the first four of these machines led him to develop a second model , which also gave excellent results . The running of the engine , ' he was able to report in 181o , is extremely smooth , and overcomes the enormous height , never before overcome in a single stage , without noticeable exertion . ' Now came the second and still more difficult task . In May , 1816 , the surveys for the new brine pipe-line were started . The water engines hitherto used were no longer applicable . But he found new solutions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two large machines were erected . The one in Pfisterleiten overcame a lift of 294 ft. , the other in Ilsank raised the brine to the top of the Soldenkopfl , the power head being 400 ft. , and the pressure on the pump piston being about 43 atmospheres . The engine cylinder was of bronze cast in the salt mine workshops of Reichenhall . The machine at Pfisterleiten , after doing its work for over ninety years , was dismantled in 1904 . Fortunately , the Deutsche Museum was already in existence and so the machine now stands in the great machine hall of the Museum as a worthy monument to Reichenbach . The machine at Ilsank worked for a still longer time . Built to raise normally 50,000 gallons of brine daily to a height of over 1,1oo ft. , it did this at a rate of working of two and a half strokes of the piston in a minute , and with an efficiency of 8o per cent . The duty was raised little by little to 114,400 // gallons a day , the machine being equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only when 145,200 gallons daily were needed ? almost three times the output for which Reichenbach had built it ? was it necessary to consider a new installation . Since 1927 , a Pelton wheel turbine has been used to drive a high-pressure centrifugal pump at a rate of 3,000 revolutions a minute . The old and new machines , built to years apart , stand side by side . Reichenbach 's engine worked tirelessly from 1817 to 1927 , 110 years . The visitor to Ilsank may admire it to-day as a monument of technical culture . It is obvious that this mighty work gave its designer and builder much anxiety , for he alone bore the responsibility , and was assured again and again by his opponents , in the memoranda sent by them to the authorities , that the work could never succeed , and even if it ever got started , would be worn out in six months . Reichenbach wrote on August 19th , 1816 : The details of so great and important an undertaking are often more difficult than the decision itself ; there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the simplest . ' He wrote to Gauss in Gottingen , in his joy at having overcome his troubles at last : I came back from Reichenhall and Berchtesgaden only a few days ago ; my work on the great giant water line is getting on splendidly , and I have never any doubt of its success . The idea of having built the largest engine in the world often gives one great pleasure ? man can never escape from vanity ! ' His brother Karl , who could call upon a number of specially trained workmen , helped him on the technical side . The pipe-line caused the greatest difficulties . Reichenbach devised a testing machine of his own , by which the pipes could be tested at three to six times the working pressure . Then came December 16th , 1817 , and Reichenbach was able to tell the Chief of the Directorate of the salt works that exactly at midnight the great engine in Ilsank was supplying // saturated brine at the Soldenkopfl . Then followed the joyous days of festival in celebration of the event . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December with the Prince and all the Court . In his presence , the great engine in Ilsank was started . As the brine poured into the reservoir , the guns ( no doubt made by Reichenbach ) thundered , all spectators cheered , and songs made by contemporary poets were sung with enthusiasm . The solemn official record of the occasion tells of visible emotion , unmistakable signs of delight , yes , even of the pearl-like tears of joy ! A few weeks later Reichenbach wrote to Gauss : This undertaking , it is true , is worlds apart from astronomy , but it is after all no shame now and then to turn one 's gaze from the heavens to the common earth . ' Utzschneider congratulated him heartily on the honour of being henceforward the first mechanic in the world . The uncommon versatility shown in this man 's work may be illustrated by a few more examples . He studied the question of cast-iron bridges ; he wished to make use of his water piston-engine for driving a factory . In 182o the King made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he played an important part in all branches of the state building work . He was famous as an engineer far beyond the confines of Germany . No wonder that he was overwhelmed with requests to give his opinion on this proposal or that . We have still to mention the water supply of Augsburg , which he was commissioned by the town magistracy to construct in 1819 . He further designed saws and grinding and polishing machines for marble , and of especial interest is a complete plan of his , dated as early as 1818 , for lighting Munich by gas . The King gave him the order for this , and the original plans are preserved in the Deutsche Museum , but the scheme was never carried out . In 1826 it was hoped at least to light the arcades of the Court Garden by Reichenbach 's plan . The Academy was asked , but the learned gentlemen would have nothing to do with // the idea . It was only in 1850 ? so great sometimes is the interval between first plan and final fruition ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Munich . Reichenbach then studied very thoroughly the plans for the Danube ? Main Canal . He noted down some remarks and ideas concerning navigation , and did actual work in some departments of it . He also designed the plan of organization of the polytechnical schools of Bavaria . His work on the steam engine was very remarkable . As we have seen , he had himself made the acquaintance of the first steam engine at Boulton and Watt 's works . His aim was to use the expansion of the steam to drive the engine at high pressure and to do without the condenser which made the engine so immobile . In this case also , Reichenbach 's work may be studied and admired in the Museum in Munich , and here too we see what this fine mechanic was able to accomplish , for we find pistons of his with metallic packing . His light high-pressure steam engine naturally suggested itself for use in transport . But Reichenbach was no longer able to realize all his hopes of the highpressure engine . In spring , 1824 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of all care and attention . A specially severe stroke carried him off on May 21st , 1826 , in his fifty-fourth year . King Ludwig I had an official obituary notice published in the state newspaper of the Kingdom of Bavaria . As a man ' ( it runs ) Reichenbach was as worthy of respect as lie was great as a savant and artist ; a pattern of honesty , sincerity , and German steadiness , a loving husband and father , a true friend , unselfish , cheerful and conciliatory in intercourse , ready to help and give good advice wherever he could . Twice happily married , he found in his family circle the sweetest recreation after his business labours , and though the early death of his only and very promising son , a boy // eight years of age , bent him low and whitened his hair prematurely , his daughter was a source of great and pure joy to him . She married happily , and presented him with a grandson . Far removed from all snobbery and petty vanity , Reichenbach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge , experience , and methods , and his best reward was when he saw that others were fortunate in making use of them . Even from afar artists came to him to ask for his advice , and instruction , and certainly none went unsatisfied away . " This account may be supplemented by an address to the Academy given by Martius in Munich in 1859 , wherein we read : Fiery , active , a steady , open , German man was Reichenbach , as he himself says " close harnessed and pulling for four " ; he threw down before him doubts , hindrances , enemies , and enjoyed his life with his friends . ' Reichenbach 's tomb is inscribed , His name is enough , his monument is his works . ' But in the Hall of Honour of the Deutsche Museum there is written under his portrait , presented by German machine manufacturers , the following : He hastened ahead of his time with far-reaching ideas . His works are distinguished by inventive genius as well as by mastery in execution . The art of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German machine construction its first notable success . ' ROBERT FULTON 1765 ? 1815 The man whose name is associated for all time with the successful introduction of the steamship came from the ROBERT FULTON I4I county of Little Britain in Pennsylvania , where he was born on November 14th , 1765 . His father came from Ireland , whither the family had emigrated from England . We first find him in 1735 as a respected citizen of Lancaster . In 1765 he wanted to go in for farming . But he had no success , and after a year was obliged to return heavily in debt to the town , where he died in 1768 . His wife , whose family also came from Ireland , had to struggle with the care of her five children . She was their support and educator , and survived until 1799 . Robert Fulton was taught up to the age of eight by his mother , then went to one of the few schools available . At seventeen he went to Philadelphia , the spiritual centre of the new-born state , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kings of the old world would have nothing to do . That time of the birth of the state made a strong impression on the boy , who always remained true to the ideals for which men in his youth had been ready to give their lives . In Philadelphia he learned drawing and painting , for which he had a strong gift . His great fellow-countryman Benjamin Franklin had himself painted . The portrait pleased him ; he recommended the young painter to his friends . Excellent prospects opened up for him . He was already able to help his mother and his brothers and sisters financially . But he longed to see more than Philadelphia and America , then so small a place , and wanted to try his luck in the Old World . At the end of 1786 or beginning of 1787 , Fulton was in London , with an introductory letter from Franklin to his countryman Benjamin West , who had become a famous painter in England . His whole ready cash amounted to scarcely 4o , but this fact caused little anxiety to one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon got commissions . A high English peer had his portrait painted by the young American . The picture was successful , and Fulton was well on the road to following Benjamin West 's example . // But he gave up all these great possibilities to turn to the art , the earliest great successes of which were in everyone 's mouth , technology . Steam engines and spinning machines had him in their grip , for Watt and Arkwright were exemplars affording the richest stimulus to his imagination and creative power . The promising painter became the distinguished engineer Robert Fulton . His first work was the design of a machine for sawing marble and other stone . In 1794 he sent a model of his machine to the Society of Arts in London , which awarded him its silver medal . In the meantime he had turned to another very promising field of technical work : canal construction . All the world was talking of canals at that time . It was hoped , before the days of railways , that they would satisfy the demand for means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which degenerated into a fever of speculation . Everyone wanted to get rich quickly by way of canal projects . Even when ten times the real value had to be paid , it was still hoped to make a profit . It was clear that this speculative mania must be followed by disaster . But before this crisis set in , canals must certainly have appeared to so imaginative a young engineer as a promising field of work . In 1793 Fulton joined up with the Earl of Stanhope , to whom we owe a number of technical suggestions in various fields . Who will feel offended with youth for believing that the whole world has been waiting for its ideas ? Youth learns all too soon , how old , very often , are the thoughts that it thinks are new . This was Fulton 's fate , who attacked the work with a fresh mind , without a thought of his predecessors . If he had known of them , he would no doubt have acted as so many up to the present day ? maintained that his plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Patent Office were so frequently unwilling to believe it First of all he invented , in 1793 , a very peculiar steamboat , one doomed from the start to technical failure . Then in 1796 he was designing a dredger , in order to be able to build his // canals quickly and cheaply . He devoted himself very thoroughly for six years to building and running these dredgers . He wanted to construct small canals , quickly and cheaply on the largest possible scale . He would have nothing to do with locks , which are expensive to construct and wasteful of time . He proceeded to invent the old inclined plane , on which his little ships were to be got up and down . He travelled about the country , learnt much from the English canal builders , and hoped for a position on one of these great undertakings . When his money came to an end , friends lent him some , but this source was not inexhaustible . Suffering want , he hoped for success . He did not forget his native land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , George Washington , telling him what advantages his canal system would bring to America , and he supplemented these representations by his book , published in 1795 under the title Small Canals . Washington may have been slightly surprised to read how his young fellow-countryman proposed to cover Pennsylvania alone , in sixty to seventy years , with about 10,000 miles of canals , so as to make almost every house accessible by a waterway . Fulton even suggested linking Philadelphia with Lake Erie by canal . He obtained money for his plans from a rich American , plans which were to be the subject of propaganda in the new republican France . In the middle of 1797 Fulton was in France ; he did not guess that he would stay there seven years . He learned French and a little Italian and German , but most of all he studied thoroughly the fundamental sciences of the engineer , mathematics , physics , and chemistry . He acquired a good scientific training , which was of great value in his wide range of work as an engineer . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , and in 1798 a patent for fifteen years was granted to Sieur Fulton . But protection by the State was not enough . It was now a question of interesting men of influence in his canal plans . On May 1st , 1798 , // Fulton wrote to General Bonaparte , who was getting ready to set out for the East and conquer the land of the Pharaohs . Fulton explains to the citizen general , ' in fine and enthusiastic words , what great advantages will be conferred by his system of small canals , how the internal prosperity of a country and freedom of trade remove the causes of war and are able to bring about permanent peace . Fulton himself may have had his doubts whether these paeans to peace would produce much impression on the General , for he suddenly turned , in this world filled with war and the tumult of war , to war work . He proposes to kill war by war , to conquer the freedom of the seas by a new and terrible weapon of his own invention . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up by mines and torpedoes the English fleet , then mistress of the seas . The submarine is introduced into the history of war as the terror of the strong , the hope of the weak . Here also Fulton had predecessors . Among these we may name Cornelius Drebbel , who , in 1624 , remained two hours under water in his boat . But we have no further details of this . After his time , numerous proposals for submarines were made . But practical experiments led to no success . Fulton had been busy with the submarine since 1797 . On December 13th of that year he communicated his plans fully to the Directory and offered to explain his invention to a man with technical training such as General Bonaparte , whom he had heard to be a good engineer . ' His communication tells us that Fulton had designed completely a machine which he calls Nautilus , and with which he hopes to destroy the whole British fleet . He has , he says , founded the Nautilus Company as a business undertaking , with which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first to know what France will pay . The Ministry took these proposals , at the time quite fantastic , seriously . Negotiations were begun . Fulton was to get only half the sum he asked . The parties seemed well on the way to an // agreement , and then Fulton received word from the Ministry that they would have nothing to do with the invention . But the inventor was persistent , and again attempted to approach the Government . He gave as his references the famous French machine builders , the Brothers Perier , Monge , Montgolfier and other well-known French savants . He only wanted to be allowed to make experiments at his own cost . The destruction of the English Navy will ensure the independence of the seas and France , the Nation which has most natural resources and population , will alone and without a rival hold the balance of power in Europe . ' No French Minister could be deaf to such considerations . He appointed referees , who were to give him an exact account of Fulton 's invention . The report is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's submarine was 6.48 metres long , 1.94 metres in diameter , and 10.37 cubic metres in capacity . Under water it was driven by four-vaned screw propellers , turned by human power through toothed gearing . Fulton hoped to drive it by three men at 240 revolutions a minute as maximum , and 120 revolutions normally . The commission calculated that three men could remain six hours under water . In reality , it was found necessary later to be satisfied with three . Submersion and rising to the surface was effected by taking in and expelling water , for which purpose pumps were provided . A sail was used for propulsion on the surface . The boat was to attach to the bottom of wooden ships submarine mines , which Fulton called torpedoes , thus using the word in a different sense from its present one . For this purpose Fulton had thought out an ingenious device , the value of which , however , the referees thought could only be determined by practical experiments . Negotiations proceeded . Fulton asked 500,000 francs as reward for the first English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would built a whole fleet of submarines , in order to attack on a grand scale . His successes would enable the English republicans to make a republic of England , and that LE // would mean the freedom of the seas and a permanent peace for all seafaring nations . France would reap the greatest advantage from this . Fulton understood in masterly fashion how to harness high politics in the service of his invention . But at first he made no progress . His means were exhausted . One can not live by writing letters . Fulton had to look around for other sources of income , and invented a machine for making ropes and cables . The invention was patented . He got more money for patents for improvements in panoramas , which Fulton as a painter was able to make excellently . The curious Parisians crowded to see them . In 1800 Fulton showed the burning of Moscow . This was not prophecy on his part . Great fires had occurred in the history of Moscow long before 1812 . But he was not so busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is said to have applied to Holland for support for his invention . But people there had no desire to go in for experiments . He set his hopes on Napoleon , in whose forcefulness he had the greatest confidence . But again and again it was his experience that it is easier to overthrow a kingdom than a bureaucracy . The French bureaucrats could not get over their objections . The Minister for the Navy had qualms of conscience about breaking the laws of war . Even when Fulton offered to blow up an old and useless ship as a proof of the power of his torpedo , objections were raised that the debris would have to be removed from the channel . But Fulton was persistent , and finally , the experiment was allowed . On July 29th , 1800 , the experiments were begun in 23 ft. of water . On August 5th , Fulton wrote from Le Havre to the Minister that all experiments had been successful . He now wanted to repeat them on the high sea . Fulton reported in detail to Monge and Laplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hardest part was over . Many improvements , devised during the experiments , could easily be made . The practical application was now at hand . Fulton boldly // attacked British ships of war blockading the French coast But they were warned , and always got away in time . He got to know Napoleon , the First Consul , personally , Monge and Laplace having introduced him with warm recommendations . In spite of the success , exceeding all expectations , of two submarines , no decisive result was obtained , the reason being that a suitable motor was yet to be invented . Three men are not enough for a muscle-power engine . Many years had to go by before a new chapter in the romantic history of the submarine could be opened . Fulton now determined to bring the steamship into being , indeed to start regular steamship lines . Wide new perspectives opened out to his eyes , ever ready to gaze far into the future . Was it impossible to alter the fact , that hundreds of great sailing ships are often held fast in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The idea of putting the newly found power of the steam engine to service on the water was obvious . Papin had already planned it . William Symington had tried it in 1788 , together with Patrick Miller , a rich Scottish banker . Later , in 18o2 , Symington had driven the Charlotte Dundas , a canal boat , by steam , but it was feared that the wash of the paddles would injure the banks of the canal . Early experiments with steamboats had also been made in France . The great French steam-engine builder Jacques-Constantin Perier tried a steamboat on the Seine in 1785 . The Marquis de Jouffroy ran a boat in 1781 , the paddle-wheel of which was driven by chains from a steam engine . But these experiments resulted in no permanent success . The time was not yet ripe for the steamship in Europe . Roads and canals still sufficed for the traffic . Matters were otherwise in the United States , the New World . Roads were hardly known in Fulton 's native country ; the great navigable rivers were the best traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In America also , the plan of using steam had been investigated . James Rumpey of Virginia had travelled on // the Potomac at the rate of over four miles an hour against the current in 1785 , 1787 , and 1788 . John Fitch of Connecticut , on September 2nd , 1785 , had put before the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia detailed drawings and a model of his steamboat . A year later Fitch had founded a steamship company . On July 27th , 1786 , a steamboat built by him in Philadelphia made a successful cruise in the Delaware . Other and greater boats followed . In 1790 he attained a speed of eight knots with a boat which was carrying persons and goods regularly between Philadelphia and Bordentown . But there was as yet no money to be made , and the line was closed down . His friends sent Fitch to France , where he succeeded in getting a patent for his steamship , but there could be no thought of developing it in the midst of the convulsions of the Revolution and the endless wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gain success . He died in 1798 a disappointed man , one of the martyrs of technology , to whom it was permitted to see the promised land only from afar . Among the pioneers of the steamship in America , one of the chief to be mentioned is John Stevens of Hoboken . Already in 1804 he had fitted his ship with a water-tube boiler and high-pressure engine , which drove two four-bladed screws . This technical feat may be admired to-day in the National Museum in Washington . In 1807 Stevens undertook a successful trial voyage with his steamer the Phoenix . His son , Robert L. Stevens , likewise a first-rate engineer , carried on his father 's work with great success . He designed the stern-paddle ship , a type still found in America , driven by an engine with a beam standing high above the deck . The great American engineer Oliver Evan ( 1755 to 1819 ) , who early had the courage to build high-pressure steam engines , also interested himself in the introduction of steam power for transport on land and water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1801 , the Chancellor Robert R. Livingston , who had also been busy with the steamship , came as United States Ambassador to Paris . The State of New York granted him in 1798 a monopoly which gave him the sole right over twenty years to run boats using the power of steam or fire on all waters of the State . He had already enquired about steam engines from Watt and Boulton , but so far had not got any . Fulton was soon fired with enthusiasm for all these plans , and in 1803 the two decided to build at their joint cost a steamboat , to be tried out on the Seine . Fulton set about the task , using paddles . Since he knew the work of his predecessors , he was aware that there was nothing new in his plans . But everything depends upon the correct dimensions of the hull and the choice of a suitable engine . The 8-h.p. engine was borrowed from Perier , the boiler and other machine parts were ordered from Etienne Calle in Paris . Fulton used for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Serpollet . Water in an amount equivalent to the steam required is squirted into a chamber heated to redness , and so suddenly transformed into steam . But the chamber burnt through , and it was necessary to go back to tried and tested forms . Fulton was thus obliged to dispense with the high pressure of 32 atmospheres which he had planned . Napoleon himself , ever well informed , had heard about the experiments , and reproached his Naval Minister with having informed him too late of Fulton 's plan , which was calculated to change the face of the world . ' He ordered the plan to be investigated by first-rate experts ; he was to be given their report within a week ; he was impatient . The newspapers gave a detailed account of a successful trial trip on August 9th , 1803 . The steamship , which moved against the current by two wheels , as quickly as a quick walker , was much admired . But Fulton , after his earlier experiences , had no idea of entering into new business dealings with France . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , the first and most famous steam-engine makers in the world , a good engine built to his own plans , and then introduce the steamship into America jointly with Livingston . In the meantime , England had got in touch with Fulton by way of Amsterdam , in order to win him and his submarine to their side . Fulton was ready to destroy the ships of France , now an empire . Under the name of Mr. Francis , he landed in England again on May 19th , 1804 . The Government entered into a very favourable agreement with him . Floating mines were tried : they were unsuccessful . Public opinion was against the new weapon of war : it was unfair and against the laws of war . ' Finally , Nelson 's victory at Trafalgar decided against these experiments of Fulton 's . The French and Spanish forces were completely annihilated , and there was no other nation against which the new weapon could be used . The Government , however , treated Fulton very generously . He received L15,000 and was allowed to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was now nothing to keep him in Europe . He felt himself healthy and fresher in mind than ever , and since , as he writes in September , i8o6 , he can not live without new projects , he determined to return to America . On December 13th , 18o6 , after nineteen years abroad , he was back home in New York . His fellow-countrymen received him with every honour ; they were proud of him ; he was now to enter on the great success of his life . There was great work to come , exceeding all his past achievements . He did not forget his torpedoes even in America , and offered his mines to the Government . Experiments were carried out , and in 1810 he published his experiences with torpedoes and submarine explosions . Finally Fulton once again ceased working in this field , for the time was not yet ripe . The work on the steamship was more necessary and urgent . When we interpose here the fact that Fulton in // 181 1 was seriously planning to build in Richmond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal in competition with the canal , we see how ceaselessly his technical genius worked at the development of new projects . Fortunately , he was able to control the flood of new ideas and to concentrate on the steamship which was to link New York with Albany . He attacked the problem with all the scientific weapons of his time . As regards the ship 's hull , the question of the resistance of the water to its motion was dealt with thoroughly . The engine , the chief parts of which had in the meantime arrived from England , was considered in relation to its action on the ship and on the paddle-wheels . An attempt was made to determine in advance the speed of the ship . Charles Browne , a shipbuilder of repute , received the order to build the ship . The engine and accessories were put in by Fulton , and on July 4th , 18o7 , he was able to report to Livingston that all wheels were running excellently . The ship was at first given no name , the word ' steamship ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the whole world . It was later named the Clermont after Livingston 's country seat . The first experiments were begun on Sunday , August 9th , 1807 . They were completely satisfactory , but there were still a few improvements to be made . The paddles were not as yet protected by boxes , so they could easily be injured , and threw up water on deck . But no one was willing to wait for everything to be finished . On Monday , August 17th , 1807 , regular steam transport began in the world . With about forty invited guests on board , and in the presence of many thousands of spectators who jeered loudly and plainly at ' Fulton 's folly , ' as they called the steamboat , the ship entered on its first voyage . As it made its way upstream at an unheard-of speed , securely steering its way , the mass of spectators became conscious that they were witnesses of a great event . The jeers became plaudits . Albany , 150 miles from New York , was reached in // thirty-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this unheard-of miracle . People were already talking of steamships on the Mississippi and Missouri . The steamships were to open up the gigantic virgin territory bought from Napoleon for 8o million francs in 1803 . Regular voyages followed the trial trip , and a timetable was arranged . In New York , ninety travellers crowded on the little ship . Financially also , the future could now be faced with confidence . The twenty newspapers then published in New York , which at that time had a population of 83,000 , scarcely took any notice of the affair . A great historical event was not recognized as such , and was submerged in the news of the moment . Winter interrupted the voyages . Fulton planned for 18o8 a complete rebuilding of the Clermont . A second steamship was to be built . Fulton was very hopeful as usual , and he was right . But this success led to other people getting busy . Lawyers found work . Had the State of New York the right to grant a monopoly for the Hudson including the lower part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The litigation was fought out with great bitterness , until finally the Supreme Court decided in Fulton 's favour . Fulton built new ships , and also ferry boats . He followed Symington 's plan and put the paddle-wheel between two hulls , in order to avoid injury to the paddles . The ships were built larger , the engines more powerful . Every voyage , every new ship had a lesson to teach , and what was learned was at once applied in practice . Fulton built altogether seventeen ships . While the Clermont of 18o8 was 148 ft. long with 18 ft. beam , and a displacement of 182 tons , we find in 1816 ships of 526 tons , 156 ft. long and 33 ft. beam . The engine power was between 20 and 30 h.p . But Fulton was not satisfied with his success between New York and Albany . He wanted to carry the steamship to victory throughout the whole world . In England he commissioned a well-known engineer , // J. C. Dyer , in 1811 , to introduce the steamship on the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what was true for America was not by any means valid , so it was said even by famous English engineers , for the Old World . All attempts were fruitless . But a year later Bell 's little steamboat was running on the Clyde , and with it European steamship transport began . Fulton wanted to confer the blessings of steamships also on Russia . The American ambassador in St. Petersburg was to get him the grant of a monopoly for twenty years for the line Cronstadt ? St. Petersburg . In 1812 he proposed to introduce steam navigation on the Ganges in association with a certain Thomas Law . America , England , Russia , and India were enough even for the mental horizon of a Fulton . His last great constructive work had again to do with war . America was at war with England . The New Yorkers felt how unprotected their harbour was . Here Fulton came in with a plan to build a steam-driven , very strongly built ship of war ? a floating battery . The ship was built according to Fulton 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried out its trial trip in June , 1815 . The great paddlewheel lay in the middle of the ship , well protected from all sides and from above . The steamer , named by Fulton Demologos , but by the Government in his honour Fulton the First , never went into action . Peace was concluded on December 24th , 1814 . The performance promised by Fulton was exceeded at the trials of the ship . Fantastic rumours were in circulation concerning the enormous dimensions and powers of the guns , which almost exceeded the imaginative accounts in mediaeval books on gunnery . Fulton was still working on the construction of a new submarine when he was carried off in the midst of creative work by an inflammation of the lungs , in his fiftieth year . Robert Fulton died on February 23rd , 1815 , deeply mourned by his fellow-countrymen , who with justice admired him as one of the great pioneers of engineering . // RICHARD TREVITHICK 1771-1833 In the south-west of England , in Cornwall of ancient fame , Richard Trevithick , the romantic of technology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was born . Two thousand years ago , men were already washing valuable tin out of the sand of the rivers and brooks of Cornwall . It was only later that the skill of the miner was applied to raising it from the depths of the earth . The arts of mining developed there and the mines burrowed deeper and deeper with success . Here also water put a limit to man 's effort . The old technical appliances were no longer equal to coping with the water underground , and the mines had to be abandoned . This disaster to Cornish mining was experienced by Newcomen . In 1715 the first steam engine was built by him in Cornwall . Among the famous masters of the art in Cornwall we may here mention the Hornblowers , father and son . Joseph Hornblower set up his first steam engine in Cornwall round about 1725 , and up to 1778 sixty atmospheric engines in all had been got to work . The engineer had become indispensable to mining . He not only built new machines and set them going , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This service was paid for by a fixed monthly sum . So engineers travelled from one mine to another , and had the possibility of comparing and exchanging experiences . Among the most esteemed masters of the art in the last quarter of the eighteenth century we have Richard Trevithick , the father of our engineer ; he was born in 1735 . He married the daughter of a mineowner . After the birth of four daughters , his son Richard was born on April 13th , 1771 , in the parish of Illogan . Shortly afterwards , the family moved to Penponds near Camborne , where the children went to school . But in those days the amount of teaching given was the least // imaginable ; schooling was finished at the age of seven or eight , and work , generally in the mines , then began . The schoolmaster was far from satisfied with Richard Trevithick ; he reported that he often played truant and was inattentive . The father also could not manage the extremely lively boy , so he gave it up , and allowed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . His High School was the mines with their numerous machines and technical works ; learning here was play to him , and what he learned was indispensable in his later career . Everyone liked the boy with his blue eyes , high spirits , and good humour , and he did not merely look on but helped vigorously whenever he was able . As son of a respected master , who was known everywhere , he had the entry into all mines . He was to be found just at the point where something was not going as it ought , and he learned a great deal from this experience of errors and miscalculations . It was a great and important event for Cornwall when in 1777 the first Watt low-pressure engine was put in commission . It needed only a third to a quarter of the amount of coal used in the Newcomen engine ; that is to say , the shafts could be sunk twice as deep as formerly . This was decisive for mining . The very widely drawn patent of James Watt stood , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their own account at steam engine building in Cornwall and in the rest of England . The mineowners complained about the high royalties which they had to pay to Boulton and Watt in Soho , and rejoiced when one of the engineers had the courage to build his own engines , which were much cheaper , in defiance of Watt 's patent . The natural result was litigation , since those in Soho had no intention of giving up their rights . Again and again it was declared there that no mineowner had ever been compelled to buy an engine . They had signed the agreement gladly and of their own free will , since it was very profitable to them in spite of the high royalty . Soho won , but what bitterness was caused on both // sides by the battle ! Trevithicks , father and son , were opponents of the Watt patent , but the son finally saw that he would never get on without making his peace with Soho , and so he entered into negotiations which , however , led to no result , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion . Murdock especially is said to have opposed taking Trevithick into the service of the firm of Boulton and Watt . Richard Trevithick started very early working as an engineer alongside his father . It is related that the mineowners were willing to give the young man , only eighteen years of age , orders such as they gave to an old and experienced engineer . The father raised objections , but the young man had won confidence , and never proved unworthy of it . If he had not succeeded in working with Boulton and Watt , if the power of the law had stopped him building steam engines independently of them , it was now his own affair to find a way out , a way of making a new form of engine , independent of the old one . All his life Richard Trevithick was full of ideas . But in this early period of his life they stormed in on him . Again and again he tried new ways , nothing seemed impossible to him , nothing frightened him . He had acquired great practical skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , but he understood little of the scientific aspects of the problems he was tackling . It was now his good fortune to gain as one of his best friends Davis Gilbert , a man who attained great eminence in the history of English science and became President of the Royal Society . We have many letters which passed between the two , and it is most refreshing to see how the great inventor and practical engineer again and again turns in confidence to his friend , his scientific conscience so to say , and asks him whether this or that may not be contrary to the laws of nature , of which he is ignorant ; and how this friend brings his best knowledge to bear on every point , advises him to drop this or that , or encourages him to go on with his plans . His father died in 1797 , and in this year he married Jane // Harvey , who was a faithful companion to him all his life under the greatest difficulties ? including financial troubles . She made allowance for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached far into the future . During the closing years of the eighteenth century he was working at the idea of his high-pressure steam engine . The importance of this engine , which together with its application to various purposes , was his greatest technical achievement , may be estimated when one recollects the enormous size and weight of the Watt low-pressure engine , which worked with condenser and air pump and was driven by a small plus pressure of about a 4 atmosphere . The framework of the engine was formed by a whole house ; engine and enginehouse were not yet separate entities . The driving force was the external pressure of the air . How much energy would he lose ( he asks his friend ) if he did without condensation , used high steam pressure , and let the steam escape into the air after use ? The answer is , one atmosphere . Trevithick sees the way open , thinks only of high pressure , intends to use 5 , 6 , 8 and even io atmospheres of steam pressure to work his engine . James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be hanged ; using such a pressure was murder for the people who had to attend to the engine . Trevithick felt bitterly about this pronouncement of the great engineer , but he saw in him the competitor who wanted to close this new road to him . He was well aware of the dangers of high pressures , but not afraid of them ; he may even have felt a sort of sporting enthusiasm about them . Naturally , he was unable to use Watt 's huge box boiler with its great flat walls . He chose the only feasible form , the cylindrical . He built great cast-iron cylinders ; his first boilers were most certainly made of dangerous material , especially in view of the then state of the art of casting . In the boiler there was a cylindrical fire-box with a return flue , so that the chimney and furnace door were on the same face of the cylindrical boiler. // The cylinder was built into the boiler , so that it was surrounded by steam and so kept hot . Naturally , accidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one of his boilers exploded in Greenwich , and that the people in Soho took the greatest trouble to make known , by newspaper articles and letters to their customers , the facts of this explosion with all their horrifying details . But the advantages of the high-pressure engine were too great for the idea of building such non-condensing engines to be given up . As compared with the great engines and boilers and condensing plant , with their huge machine houses , Trevithick built small machines in which engine and boiler were united , machines which could readily be erected anywhere . The small size of these plants , and their low weight per horse-power , astonished engineers again and again . What could be more obvious than the idea of using these small and movable machines for transport ? And so Trevithick got to work on the steamboat . He wanted to use screws for propulsion . But more than this , he was the first to make a steam road car and a steam locomotive . He was already building models at home in the closing years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delighting his guests by making them run about the table and the floor . He used a spirit flame for the boiler , or put a piece of red-hot iron in the furnace of his little engine . Here also Trevithick was not the first . In 1769 , Nicolas Joseph Cugnot had already built in Paris a lorry for military purposes , driven by an atmospheric engine , but this clumsy construction was not a success . And then Murdock in Cornwall had also had a little model of a locomotive running about his room , but he too had to give up working on it , because his employers , Boulton and Watt , insisted that he should not divide his energies , but only put up Watt engines and see to their maintenance . Concerning Trevithick we know , by the way , that he knew nothing of Murdock 's little steam locomotive , though this is often said to be the case . // Now came a memorable year in technical history , i 800 , in which Watt 's patent expired . The road was open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the steam engine . Everyone thought he could improve it , very few succeeded . So it was now open to Trevithick to realize all his plans in this field . He no longer contented himself with the small model , but proceeded to build the first steam automobile . The question had previously arisen whether the friction of the wheels on the road would be sufficient , not when the source of power was able , as in the case of man or horse , to push against the road , but when the force of the steam was applied through the spokes of the wheels . This question had been discussed at curiously great length , but Trevithick was a master of the practical experiment . It is related that he had a farm cart loaded with stones and , taking off his coat , grasped , along with his friends , the spokes of the wheels and proved that the wagon could indeed be driven by this means . The machine was soon built . It was on Christmas Eve , 1801 , that Dick 's firedragon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Trevithick had not even sought out the highway for his trial , but chose a bad road with a steep hill . To everyone 's delight , the car set itself in motion with mighty puffs , and now there was no holding people back ; everyone who could jumped on the traction-engine , for that is what the first steam car looked like . All were delighted at the way it took the steep hill . But here again the trouble came later . The boiler could not produce nearly as much steam as was needed for the work to be done , and people were glad to be able to push the machine back home by hand after it had got half way . But everyone had the confident feeling : it works ! The difficulties would be overcome . In spite of the misfortune which followed the fine start of the journey , consolation was quickly found . The overworked machine was pushed into a shed , and the company adjourned to an inn , to refresh itself on roast goose and the accompanying drinks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being forgotten to draw the boiler fire . The water evaporated , the boiler became red hot , and every combustible part of the machine went up in flames , together with the first garage in the world . But Trevithick had no thought of giving up his plans . He was granted a patent for his steam engine for fixed and movable use . He joined up with other engineers for common enterprise , and in 1803 built a second steam car and sent it to London . All over England he put in his high-pressure steam engines for the most varied purposes . If he had now felt able to limit his activities to this branch , and set up a works of his own , he would have made it equal in importance to the first steam-engine works in the world at Soho . But that was not his line . He wanted to remain the independent engineer , unhampered by manufacturing on his own account . He was the customer of a whole number of smaller or larger foundries , smithies and works which perhaps , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The year 1804 was also notable in technical history , for in this year the first locomotive in the world ran on iron rails . All over England betting was a favourite sport , and in the mining districts of Wales people were particularly ready to make the decision of technical questions even more exciting by laying heavy bets on them . A talk over drinks about the possible performance of a steam wagon in the minefield , to run over the flat cast-iron rails then in use , comparable to wooden planks , led to a bet , and Trevithick was quite willing to fulfil the required conditions . His locomotive did better than was expected , and it is said that the loser even paid gladly , being delighted at the result of the trial . But the unaccustomed load broke the iron rails , and at that time one could not imagine making the structure stronger merely so as to be able to use steam . So the engine and boiler were taken off the wheels and used to drive a hammer in an ironworks , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All his life Trevithick had paid little attention to politics , but events were now of too great a magnitude not to have an effect on him and his work . Napoleon was seriously planning to invade England with his armies . This made the whole country uneasy , and everywhere the desire was not merely to organize defence , but to make the whole project impossible from the start . At this juncture Trevithick came on the scene . He proposed to send steam-driven fireships among the warships , and set the whole fleet on fire . Naturally he wanted to be there himself . But after all he did not get as far as this use of steam power . In 1805 he built two railway locomotives for Newcastle , and in the same year a canal boat with steam engine and paddles . In 1806 he built the first three steam dredgers and set them going on the Thames ; and as though he had not yet enough irons in the fire , he took part in the plan to drive a tunnel , mining-fashion , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . There was a great difference between driving an adit through solid rock and making a tunnel under a riverbed , where one would have constantly to reckon with a dangerous inrush of water . He showed that his incredible energy and technical skill enabled him to do great work in this field also . Of 1,200 feet , he finished 1,000 feet . But the technical difficulties were augmented by personal difficulties with the people he had to do with . Finally the whole undertaking came to a dead end and was abandoned . Trevithick now had time for new plans . In 1808 he built a passenger locomotive , brought it to London , and got it running in the middle of the town on a large plot of building land near Russell Square . He put a strong fence round the ground and charged a shilling entrance to see the new marvel and travel on it once round in a circle . The locomotive was described as Trevithick 's travelling steam engine , its name as given on the entrance ticket was Catch me who can . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspapers , // stimulated great interest . Everybody wanted to see the machine , but few had the courage to take a ride on it . We hear that great sums were bet on it . It ran for some weeks , and then a rail broke , and the whole machine went straight on and then turned over . Fortunately , the ground was very soft . The trips were then given up , for Trevithick was losing money , the gate money not being enough to pay the running costs . A tablet has been put up in commemoration of this machine . We must further mention Trevithick 's patent for iron tank ships , which were to serve for loading and unloading the great sailing vessels . In 1809 he was granted a patent for floating docks and for iron masts . He wanted to cook by steam , and he raised sunken ships by means of his tanks . In the meantime he had moved to London in order to carry out his numerous business undertakings . He was there seized in 1810 by a severe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a heavy financial disaster . He owed it to his partners that he was not saved from bankruptcy , he whose greatest anxiety was that others should not suffer on account of his losses . Back in his Cornish home , he turned with great success again to the mine pump . He built pumps of entirely new design with huge plunger pistons , and above all , he made use of higher steam pressure and greater expansion . He devised the cylindrical boiler with interior fire , which then became known throughout the world as the Cornish boiler , and is still used to-day in many plants as an efficient type of boiler with large water capacity . Technically speaking , the work which he did for Cornish mining can not be estimated too highly . Trevithick took care that the engines were regularly overhauled , and finally got to the point at which the performance , expressed by the ratio of water raised to coal consumed , was published . This had a great educative value , and also appealed to the sporting instincts of the mineowners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It thus came about that Trevithick 's highpressure expansion engines in Cornwall , by reason of a coal consumption so low as to be frequently not credited in other parts of England , were everywhere admired as masterpieces of steam engine construction . They had an essential influence on steam engine design far beyond the frontiers of England . They made it possible to reduce the coal consumption to a third or a quarter of that attained by Watt in 1800 , who himself had made a like advance as against the atmospheric engines . It has been calculated that this engine of Trevithick 's saved the mineowners of Cornwall over half a million pounds in ten years . But in this also he worked for others ; no financial reward came to him and his . Trevithick needed his Boulton . When we add that he used his little locomobile high-pressure engines early on in agriculture for threshing and grinding corn and sawing wood , and when we further note that he constructed in 1813 a sort of earth cutter which could move over the land , we see from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind was in all branches of technical work . Again one may say , Less would have been more , ' but he had to go storming onward , and his ideas always ranged far beyond what he was able to carry out . Trevithick was forty-two years of age when his highpressure steam engine led him into the greatest adventure of his life . In Peru there were rich silver mines , distant about 16o miles from the capital , Lima , and situated in the mountains 14,000 ft. up . But these mines loaded with riches were a failure , for existing technical means were unequal to fighting the water . Now the steam engine had already been heard of in Peru . Unwilling to yield the treasure to the water without striking a blow , the owners decided to send a Swiss , Franciskus Uville , who had been many years in Peru , to London , to seek in the land of technology the means by which access to the silver could be preserved . He did what seemed most obvious , he got in touch with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn that at so great a height above sealevel , a low-pressure steam engine would be very inefficient ; and even if one resigned oneself to that , how could such a gigantic machine be dragged 14,000 ft. up over tracks only passable by mules ? Uville then saw by chance in a London shop-window one of Trevithick 's small high-pressure steam engines . He bought it for L20 and went straight back to Lima with his prize . The machine was set up in the mine and worked satisfactorily . The way was now clear , and a company was formed to pump out the Pasco mines . Uville was then sent again on the long journey to England to find the man who had invented and was building highpressure steam engines . But Uville , sent as emissary to Trevithick without even knowing his name , became seriously ill on the way . He learned on board ship that the builder of engines was Richard Trevithick , and chance would have it that his informant was a cousin of Trevithick . The ship berthed in Falmouth on May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Peruvian was still ill and had to stay in bed , but he at once wrote to Trevithick , who already visited him on the zoth May . Trevithick was delighted with the idea of saving by means of his engine the wealth of a whole country . Uville shared his enthusiasm , and translated it into terms of big orders for Trevithick , to a value greatly exceeding the sum provided for by the Company in Lima . Trevithick was very busy . Since he himself did not make engines , he handed over the orders to his friends . No one could deliver quickly enough for him , and Trevithick promised money galore . He told everyone ready to listen of the vast richness of the mines , and that dollars and work were to be had from them in abundance . Once again Trevithick was dreaming of a golden future . The directorate of the Company in Peru was no less enthusiastic . The mineowners ' company expressed the same sentiments in writing . A monument was proposed , to inform posterity of the great work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was // now to pour out of these mines and fill all other nations with admiration . This silver would stimulate trade and bring prosperity to the whole country . It would fill the royal treasury of the beloved ruler . In the same year , Napoleon had been banished to St. Helena . The world was again at peace , but all hopes set upon this event were , at first , unfulfilled . The worldcrisis took effect everywhere , there was no trade , no money , no credit , nothing but general decay . In the meantime Uville had returned to America with an English technical expert . Matters had now come to the point of Trevithick having been won personally for the work on the Peruvian mines . He embarked on October Goth , 1816 , with three other Englishmen . He thought to be away only a short time , and certainly never dreamed that eleven years would go by before he saw England again . New engines were constantly sent out , but not only for the mines ; the State Mint needed a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction . The output of the Mint was greatly increased . We are also told about Trevithick 's arrival in Peru . When he landed , all the bells were rung , everyone with a pair of legs was out in the streets , which were crowded with people anxious to welcome him . Men of high position in the land had travelled far so as not to miss his arrival . It was proposed to put up a statue in silver to Trevithick . But there was soon another side to the picture . Uville himself was jealous of Trevithick . The Englishman found opposition everywhere ; it was easier for him to deal with machines than with jealous and ill-disposed people whom , we may well imagine , he did not treat all too gently , his temperament being what it was . Uville died in August , 1818 , and another Englishman who had been making trouble for him had died a few months earlier , so that the greatest hindrances seemed to be overcome . But the revolution broke out , everywhere in South America it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been an everyday occurrence even before Trevithick 's arrival . Simon Bolivar , the Liberator , was the leader of this movement . Lima , the headquarters of Spanish military power in South America , had remained comparatively calm , but in February , 1817 , shortly after Trevithick 's arrival in Peru , a Spanish army had been completely defeated by the rebels . In the next year victory favoured the other side . But the Spanish were not able to keep their hold on the country permanently ; in 1821 , Peru declared itself independent , and Bolivar marched into it . These political events did not fail to affect the silver mines . Trevithick was helpless in face of the troops . Now it was the Spaniards , now the Liberators , who were in possession of the mines . It was just the latter who , fearing that the Spaniards might again seize the mines and use the silver so gained to strengthen their power , destroyed everything movable , and threw the machine parts down the mines . These machines had been successful , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now all their work was in vain . Even Trevithick 's friendly relations with Bolivar were no help to him . In 1824 Trevithick left the soil of Peru , upon which he had put his foot seven years earlier filled with tremendous hopes . The indefatigable Trevithick had not only erected and run his engines high up in the Andes , but , as a man closely connected from childhood with mining , had received again and again the strongest impressions of the natural riches everywhere to full of great and new hopes . We know that he raised a Chilean warship , which had been sunk with its full complement of bronze cannon , and much else , and had saved all the valuable tin and copper . He received ? 2,5oo for this service , and one of his friends strongly advised him to send the money to his wife at home . But Trevithick used the whole sum for fresh dreams . He had been advised to take shares in a Panama pearl-fishing enterprise , and in it lost the last penny . After // this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time . Great anxiety was felt for him , but meantime he was travelling about the country , ever in pursuit of new hopes . We find him in Ecuador where he met a Scotsman , Gerard , who shared his belief in the enormous riches of the country . Trevithick travelled to Columbia at Bolivar 's request , but he gave up all profit that this connection might have brought him and proposed to open up , jointly with Gerard , the mineral riches of Costa Rica . The two studied mining there for four years . They acquired extensive mining rights of great value , surveyed the land , and acquired every sort of useful information . They planned to open up new great mines , to build settlements , construct railways , erect stamp batteries , and to carry out many other projects . They proposed to mine 250,000 tons of ore a year , and dreamed again of the golden treasures lying underground . But first they proposed to return to England in order to raise the necessary capital for these undertakings . They were unwilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but proposed to travel right across the pathless mountains , through virgin forest and desert to the Caribbean Sea on the other side , from which the way home would be shorter . This journey was , at that time , an unparalleled adventure . Accompanied only by a few persons , among them two boys who were to go to school in England , they set out , trusting to their good fortune , like their predecessors the Conquistadores of old . The party suffered loss of life , Trevithick came very near to drowning in crossing a river , but even this adventure was finally successful . After a three weeks ' exhausting march , they arrived at the southern harbour of the State of Nicaragua , ( ; reytown , completely exhausted and with torn clothing . From here they got to the harbour of Cartagena , and by a curious chance Trevithick met in the hotel there young Robert Stephenson , whom he had known as a boy , and with whose father he had so often talked over railways and locomotives . Stephenson gave him money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to North America in order to see Niagara Falls . Concerning Trevithick we know that he went on to Jamaica and from there to Falmouth . He was not even able to pay his fare , and one of his fellow-travellers gave him enough money to enable him to leave the ship . Anyhow , it is said that he came back to his native country after eleven years ' work without a penny . His only possessions were the clothes he stood up in , a gold watch , a compass , and a pair of silver spurs . But he still had mining concessions for a copper mine , and for rich mines in Costa Rica . He hoped to sell these concessions in England for a large sum , but his endeavours were in vain . How strong was his faith in their enormous value is seen from the fact that he rejected indignantly a cash offer of 8,000 . When his friend told him that he would have done well to take the money , he was so angry that he almost threw the man downstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New World to his native country , technical development had progressed . The high-pressure machine was everywhere in use ; in America , in Germany , enthusiastic advocates of high pressure existed . The Cornish pumping plant and boiler had proved its value . Steam navigation had been introduced , even on the ocean . The steam locomotive had already found a place in mining ; in fact , the great railway connecting Liverpool and Manchester was being built , and the steam carriage was in use in London and its environs . The iron industry had made great advances . When Trevithick arrived in Cornwall , his fellow-countrymen gave him a great reception . Everywhere the bells were ringing , everywhere he was given banquets , the most prominent men in Cornwall could not do enough to celebrate his achievements , and they assured him again and again that without his labours deep mines would have been impossible . He was treated like a great hero , while it was forgotten that he did not possess a penny . But Trevithick had not yet lost his optimism . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be followed by a respectable financial recognition . Here he deceived himself ; he had a great moral claim , but it could not be upheld in a court of law and so the mineowners , enriched by his efforts , did not present him with a penny . But his courage was not yet broken ; he ever conceived new plans . He improved ships ' guns . He wrote to his scientific friend that he had now heard that much money was being spent in bringing ice from Greenland and that he believed ice might be made artificially by the use of the steam engine . He also made journeys abroad ; he went to Holland to assist in land reclamation . We also learn from one of his letters that he was in Germany , and was there interested in the heating of large rooms . He paid much attention to this problem and proposed to heat them with steam , or better , hot water . But nothing brought in money . Along with his Cornish boilers he built water-tube and tubular boilers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building of a gigantic tower . The Reform Bill passed through Parliament in March , 1831 . A great many English people believed in the coming of a Golden Age . Trevithick , too , wished to honour this new epoch and designed in 1832 an enormous column , 1,000 ft. high , loo ft. across at the base , and 11 ft. at the point . It was to be made from 1,200 pieces of cast iron . A highpressure steam engine of 20 h.p. was to take visitors to the top in ten minutes . This whole national monument was to cost 8o,000 . It would have been five times the height of the Nelson column in Trafalgar Square . This plan ? perhaps not regrettably ? was never carried out . Trevithick , who in his last years worked in Dartford , Kent , in association with a young and enterprising engineer , John Hall , lived there alone in a modest inn , his family remaining in Cornwall . Here he designed his machines , and here ended the life of this great engineer on April 22nd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the costs of the funeral . He was interred in a pauper 's grave , now unknown . // It is assumed that he died of inflammation of the lungs ; his iron constitution had after all not been exposed without injury to the eleven years of intense strain in America . Trevithick was a tall and impressive figure , 6 ft. 4 in. in height , and broad shouldered ; he had a fine , well-shaped head on a splendidly built body . His bright-blue eyes and somewhat large mouth with its kindly expression were never forgotten by anyone who knew him . He paid great attention to his clothing and behaviour , and anyone meeting him in a London street would certainly have taken him for one of the most respected citizens . Full of good humour and gaiety , he could readily forget the cares of every day in cheerful company ; he had a gift for expressing himself well . People loved to listen to him when talking of his thoughts and ideas , and of all there was still to be done in technical work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the force of his temperament into every new task . He was an optimist who did not see what had already been done , but what there was still remaining to do . He understood how to carry people along with him , and this fact no doubt brought much harm to others . But what would the world be like if we had no such pacemakers to set the times moving quickly ? His whole make-up was that of a practical man , and at the same time he was a dreamer . He forgot over his technical plans both his family and friends . He lived all the time in the future , he despised gold and goods , and yet saw in them the external expression of recognition , after which he struggled in vain . He thus enjoyed to the full after his own fashion the life for which his nature fitted him . All the mischances which it brought him did not embitter him . Shortly before his death he wrote down his ideas about his life , and with these words we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and madness for attempting what the world calls impossibilities , and even from the great engineer , the late Mr. James Watt , who said to an eminent scientific character still living , that I deserved // hanging for bringing into use the high-pressure engine . This so far has been my reward from the public ; but should this be all , I shall be satisfied by the great secret pleasure and laudable pride that I feel in my own breast from having been the instrument of bringing forward and maturing new principles , new arrangements of boundless value to my country . However much I may be straitened in pecuniary circumstances , the great honour of being a useful subject can never be taken from me , which to me far exceeds riches . ' GEORGE and ROBERT STEPHENSON 1781 ? 1848 &; 1803 ? 2859 The introduction of the steam-driven railway is one of the decisive events in human history . We speak of a time before and after the introduction of railways , and wish to express thereby the fact that our lives have been changed fundamentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mankind undreamed-of possibilities in the most diverse directions . The development of trade and industry as known to us to-day would have been unthinkable without the railway . But its effects extend far beyond these , and exceed , in all that we now take for granted to-day , the dreams even of the wildest optimists , who only a century ago had to face ridicule for prophecies which were soon to be far exceeded by facts . This technical achievement was not , of course , the offspring of one man 's brain . Whole generations of engineers and clever workmen took part in its creation . But a century ago there was living , still at the height of his fame as foremost railway engineer of the world , a man whose great powers and tough endurance were justly rewarded by the greatest success in the age when the railway was born : George Stephenson . This famous son of the coal-miner Robert Stephenson was // born on June 8th , 1781 , in a low ivy-covered cottage in the little mining village of Wylam , eight miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekly wage of 12s. , and it was even in those days by no means easy to keep a family of six children . We know that the father was industrious and skilful , and that he had great pleasure in nature , in animals and plants , a taste inherited by his son . It is related that he used to tell the school children , after work was over , the most wonderful fairy-tales and stories of adventure , and hence was much admired by the young . He was too poor to be able to send his children to school . They had to start helping in the house at an early age , and earn a few pence themselves as soon as possible . George Stephenson , when a small child , had to look after cows and prevent them straying on the railway of the mine . He was proud when he was finally allowed to drive the horse working a hoist , and his highest ambition was one day to carry coals to the old atmospheric engine . And so he rose to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had earned now became shillings to take home . His real school was the mine , and there he learned what there was to be learned . He was soon able to help and to take care of the engine , and when work was over he endeavoured to get the most complete knowledge of the machine and all its parts by cleaning it , taking it apart and putting it together again . Young Stephenson thus developed into a skilled worker , and also into a cheerful comrade . He loved to pit his bodily powers against those of his comrades . It is related cf Stephenson , as of Trevithick , that none could throw the blacksmith 's hammer as high as he . He was already eighteen when he began to learn to read and write , for he recognized that these arts would open the doors of further progress to him . At twenty-one years of age he married Fanny Henderson , the servant of the mineowner , and in 1803 his son Robert was born to him , who was to be his great collaborator in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ambition was from the first to give his son the education , of which he himself had so often and so painfully felt the need . But money was needed for that , and he had to think of a way to earn more . He first tried his hand at cobbling ; he nailed good solid soles on the miners ' boots , and made all repairs to the shoes of the villagers . This was no road to riches . In the meantime he had also set to work to understand clocks thoroughly , and he was soon in a position to apply his skilful hands to repairing them ; in this way , putting clocks and watches to rights was soon bringing him a certain income . He told later how proud he was when he was first able to call a piece of gold his own . A journey to Scotland , in the course of which he was able to execute a number of orders , brought him what was , in his circumstances , a substantial profit . But when he came back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , and so what the son had earned just sufficed to support the father . He set to work again to save , and his steady persistence enabled him to put aside shilling after shilling . He was soon able to send his son to the High School at Newcastle , and it must have been an affecting picture when father and son sat together in the evenings at the thick oak table , and went together through the problems set by the teacher . In this way the father learned from the son and his teachers . After his schooling in Newcastle , Robert had first to get a thorough knowledge of the practical work of a coal-mine . He was for three years working at all the various branches of this , and his father had then got on so well as to be able to send him to Oxford or Cambridge . But this step seemed to him too long a one . He did not want his son to rise so quickly out of his class . He was afraid of mere learning and over-refined people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But even there Robert Stephenson was only able to put up with a single term . Together with what he had learned by practical work , and with his quick grasp of // things , it seemed to him enough . Many changes had come about in his father 's position . He had moved from one mining district to another . He had learned everywhere whatever there was to be learned , and everywhere he had done his work steadily and carefully . In this way he had risen from stoker to machine master and then to manager of the whole technical plant of the coal-mines . Another great technical feat of Stephenson 's must not be forgotten . He invented the miner 's safety-lamp , which prevented the many terrible explosions from which the mines of his district especially had had to suffer . Stephenson had already made in August , 1815 , before Humphry Davy , a satisfactory safety-lamp , which he considerably improved in the course of that year . The lives of many miners were saved by his invention , and by it the mines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the mine to the place where it was to be used , or to the ship , caused him much anxiety . He improved the railway , he worked on the wagons , he had heard of Trevithick 's steam carriage ? indeed , one had come to Newcastle , and another had been ordered from Trevithick who , however , full of other problems , had not got as far as delivering it . In Leeds , the great industrial town , a machine master , Blenkinsop , had also built a locomotive . But he was one of those who were convinced that iron could not get a grip on iron . Hence he had put down a toothed rack between the rails , and had taken out a patent for the first cog-wheel locomotive . Another master , Hedley , had had more confidence in friction , and had built , like Trevithick , a small locomotive which he called Puffing Billy . It was put in commission in 1813 . It has been preserved to us , and is now in the Science Museum in South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy of it , able to run under its own steam . Hedley deserves the credit of having been the first to put into practical service a locomotive with smooth wheels travelling on flat rails . // George Stephenson observed this development with growing interest , and succeeded in persuading the owner of the mines in the Killingworth area to make a trial with a locomotive built by him . In 1814 the first Stephenson locomotive was turned out from the mine workshops , mostly by the work of Stephenson 's own hands ; he called it Blucher , for all England at that time was full of enthusiasm for the Prussian Marshal Forwards . ' This name was a good omen ; the first step to the creation of the railway had been taken , from then on things went forward . The first locomotive was followed by others , more and more experience could be utilized . The mineowners also saw the great advantages of steam traction . But progress was still very slow . Stephenson was not the man to make propaganda for himself and his ideas ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His post prevented him from devoting himself entirely to the railway , for he had also to deal with pumping and hoisting plant , and he managed to deal successfully even with the oldest of these . The word went round that he was the best machine doctor in the neighbourhood , and his employers were quite agreeable to his helping others besides themselves to keep their machines in order . For eight years Stephenson 's locomotives did their work day by day up there in the North , without the slightest notice being taken of them either by the newspapers or . by the technical world . Elsewhere the only thought at the time was for the improvement of the roads . Macadam made great improvements in this field ; he was justly given praise and fame , and received a grant of 41,000 , whereas not a shilling was given to Stephenson . It was the time when everyone believed that victory would go to the steam carriage running on the improved roads . Leeds as a great centre of trade was much more in the public eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But at last Stephenson 's time came . On November 18th , 1822 , a fair-sized railway was opened on the Hetton // mine , not far from Sunderland , and Stephenson had to deliver the first five locomotives for it . People called them iron horses ' ; they were used only for hauling coal trucks on the flat , stationary steam engines being used for pulling them up the very heavy gradients . Stephenson had provided five such cableways . He now became known to a wider public as a man who could not only build railways and locomotives but also run them to the economic advantage of the owner . A new problem was set him in 1823 . He was chosen to build the very important railway from Darlington to Stockton , a line of decisive importance for the whole development of railways . It was to transport the coal wealth of the county of Durham to North Sea ports . The promoter was Edward Pease of Darlington . He was a coalowner , and wanted to improve transport in order to open up new markets for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traction . But when he got to know Stephenson he slowly and cautiously acquired faith in steam . The railway was the first designed for serving the general public . Pease was the far-sighted entrepreneur who went to work with iron energy and endurance . Smiles , Stephenson 's biographer , was able to visit Pease as late as 1854 , in his eighty-eighth year , and found him as full of life and mental energy as if he were only forty years old . It was men of such metal as this who brought railways into being in a comparatively short time . He related how hard it had been to get money for this railway . He had to go to his best friends and beg them again and again to do their share in getting together at least the money necessary for building the line . But permission had first to be obtained from Parliament , for it was a question of a public highway . This also was done , but only in face of great difficulties , of which we will speak presently . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriages may be drawn by men and animals or otherwise . ' None dared to mention steam traction . Exactly as in the case of a canal , a fixed sum was paid for the use of the road . // The track was open from morning to evening . Naturally , it was soon evident that a railway is not a canal , and the owners proceeded to take over the running themselves . It was Pease , too , who with Stephenson set up a locomotive works in Newcastle . This first locomotive works in the world was opened in 1823 , and is still working to-day . It was of decisive importance , for George Stephenson , who put the management in the hands of his young son Robert , whose name the firm bears , was able to collect around him men who understood something of locomotives and railways . That was a work which was as necessary as it was difficult , but he was successful . Many of the most important railway engineers came from this locomotive works , and became pioneers of English railways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son in distant countries , where they taught the local engineers . The line from Darlington to Stockton aroused widespread interest . New railway projects sprang up everywhere . The most important plan of all was to link the great port of Liverpool with the trading and industrial city of Manchester by a railway . The business men and industrialists of both towns had recognized , from their own experience , the necessity for an efficient means of transport . The canals sometimes failed in winter . The textile industry had developed to such an extent that cotton arriving in Liverpool from America could not be got quickly enough to Manchester . The factories were frequently idle for days for want of cotton . So the leading industrialists got together in order to apply to the Government for permission to build this railway . All sorts of plans were made , but the greatest need was for a man able to carry out the work on his own responsibility . The Darlington and Stockton railway was studied , and it was believed that in George Stephenson the only man capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this decision , for George Stephenson was not at that time one of the famous engineers of the // land . What was he after all but a mechanic who now and then built a locomotive ? He was not to be mentioned in the same breath with the great builders of roads , canals , and harbours . But he now had to face the music in London before the Parliamentary Committee dealing with the Bill . These were certainly the hardest hours in Stephenson 's life , as he used to say later . There he stood , the big burly Northerner , whose forefathers had once immigrated from Scotland . The words of broad hard Doric came stumblingly and reluctantly from the strong , well-cut mouth . The refined and educated men in the Committee smiled at his clumsy turns of expression . His manner of speech seemed to Londoners rough and untaught , and he was mockingly asked whether he was indeed an Englishman . The opponents of the railway ? chiefly those who had made fortunes from canals , and great landowners ? had engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they understood how to cross-examine Stephenson to a point at which he at times was unable to follow . But this gives an idea of how new the railway was , and how much energy was required to push it forward in face of all difficulties . Not one of the great engineers took Stephenson 's side ; he had to fight his battle alone . And what absurd remarks were made ! The locomotive would set fire to all houses near the line , it would burn up the cornfields ! Worst of all ? and this was the sorest point with the great landowners who were lovers of the chase ? all game would leave the neighbourhood . No pheasants and no foxes would be left , and then what would there be left to live for ? Also the noise would be unendurable , the land near the railway would be unsaleable . And what was to become of all the people who were driving the stage coaches , famed throughout the world , on the roads only recently improved , and of the many roadside inns at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wiped out by such wild projects , which anyhow could never be realized . And then came the technical // experts , who proved quite clearly that the locomotive was an absurdity . For it had to carry coal and water with it , and it would certainly be necessary to provide every few miles great stores of coal and casks of water . If steam was to be used , there was only one way to do it ; to put up at certain points great , solid , well-tried condensing steam engines , and pull the carriages along by ropes . Stephenson was asked at what speed he proposed to run his trains . His friends had begged him not to let out the fact that he believed the speed would be ten miles an hour , but to say six only . But even that appeared too high , and what reply would have been made to a prophet who predicted that in a century men would be travelling at ten times the speed then held to be possible ? Stephenson had naturally to put forward plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here forcible resistance was encountered . The farmers , armed with sticks and stones , drove away the surveyors and smashed their instruments . They were in danger of their lives . Stephenson had to post sentries , and strove to get the most important data secretly . It was clear that such data were not always free from error , and this fact was used to prove that he understood nothing of the whole business . He wanted to carry his line over a notorious bog , a bog which swallowed up even a stick thrown into it . What could be more foolish than to believe that one could lay iron rails over such ground , and run heavy loads over them ? Ridicule and mockery were rained on Stephenson for months , and when he was asked again and again from all sides to give exact details of what he intended to do , he finally spoke words which have become classical in technical history : I ca n't tell you how I will do it , but I will do it . ' The Bill was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the work could begin . Even now every possible obstacle was put in the way , but it was finally seen that it could not be prevented in the end , and then all those who believed 18o GREAT ENGINEERS themselves to have suffered damage , came to court and asked for compensation , often of large amounts , for what they did not possess , and so could not lose . If the railway could not be averted , at least something might be made out of it . Here again continuous fighting went on . The question of the means of traction was not yet finally decided . The more cautious of the promoters believed rather in the stationary steam engines recommended by the engineers ; they were thinking in terms of horse traction . But Stephenson finally succeeded in persuading them at least to make a trial with locomotives . It was agreed to hold a competition , the most famous in all technical history . A ? 50o prize was regarded as a sufficient stimulus to competition . The locomotive was specified as having to weigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20-ton load , including tender and water tank , at the rate of ten miles an hour , and to cost not more than ? 550 . The steam pressure was not to exceed 3.5 atmospheres . The test was to take place on a straight , level stretch of line two miles long at Rainhill between Liverpool and Manchester . The locomotive was to traverse this course twenty times . On the day of the competition , October 8th , 1829 , only four locomotives appeared , among them the famous Ericsson 's Novelty . Stephenson 's locomotive Rocket won the race . It was built in the new works at Newcastle , and had the tubular boiler still usual to-day , producing steam at a rate exceeding all previous locomotive boilers . The business director of the railway , Booth , made the suggestion of inverting the action of the water-tube boiler then under trial , by sending the hot gases through the tubes . Stephenson took up this idea and carried it out . The cylinder , hitherto vertical , was put in a sloping position , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisive point was the decision to lead the exhaust into the chimney , as Trevithick had previously done with full knowledge of the effect , which is greatly to increase the draught . Here again we see that Stephenson GEORGE AND ROBERT STEPHENSON x8i was not the inventor of the locomotive , but the great designer and constructor , who assembled the different parts in such a way as to form the most effective machine . The success of his locomotive exceeded all expectations . It attained an average speed of over thirteen miles an hour , and its maximum speed was twenty-one and a half miles per hour . The prize was divided between Booth and Stephenson . The Rocket developed about 12 h.p. , and a few alterations brought its power up to 20 h.p. , using about 17 to 19 lb. of coke per horse-power hour . That was a great advance on previous locomotives , which developed at most 10 h.p. and used 28 to 30 lb. of coal for the horse-power hour . This battle of the locomotives at Rainhill , as it was called in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15th , 1830 , decided the question whether locomotives or stationary engines were to be used on railways for good and all in favour of the locomotive . Robert Stephenson was not able to be at his father 's side in the most difficult years because he had accepted an offer to get some large mines started in Central America . He had enlisted Cornish miners , whom he found , however , very hard to manage , for they refused to submit to discipline of any sort , and thought they knew all about mining on their own account . After years of very hard work and worry he determined to follow his father 's urgent call to come back to England . No one needed him more than his father . He thus came to play an essential part in his father 's work . Father and son were equally highly esteemed , and the fame of the son soon began to exceed that of the father at largescale engineering work . Robert Stephenson became the great railway engineer equipped with wide experience and the best knowledge of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth on equal terms . Father and son remained true comrades in the fight for the development of the new means of transport . This is one of the most beautiful pages in engineering history . // The opening of the railway by the Prime Minister , Wellington , the victor of Waterloo , took place with all due ceremony . All expectations were far exceeded , and the traffic between Liverpool and Manchester increased enormously . Exactly the opposite happened to what had previously been feared . The land along the line did not decline in value , on the contrary , its price increased very considerably . The traffic was at first taken by eight Stephenson locomotives . It was hoped to carry 400 to 600 persons daily , but the actual figure was 1,200 . By the year 1835 , 500,000 passengers had already been carried . In 183o , the thirty miles between Liverpool and Manchester took a good hour , an almost unimaginable speed . A serious technical reporter expressly states in his account that the ladies conversed quite coolly with the gentlemen in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liverpool to Manchester broke the spell . Everyone everywhere now wanted to have the new means of transport as quickly as possible . Bills for new railways were laid before Parliament in ever-increasing numbers . But the obtaining of these legal rights cost enormous sums , which were a burden on the railways from the start . To this was added the battle of the engineers . Everyone wished to give proof of his technical skill , each wanted to be more daring than the next man , and this ambition of the engineers cost the promoters much money . But Stephenson went quietly on his way . He did not let his knowledge of what was technically possible disturb his sound economic calculations . He wanted his shareholders to earn money , for only so could the development of railways be encouraged . He and his son continued to get further great contracts for important railway lines , and carried them out to the great satisfaction of their clients . But they could not build nearly all the railways they were called upon to build . And so came finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the value of ? 44,000,000 were promoted in Parliament . In // the next year the value of the lines which were to be built had risen to L400,000,000 . Railway mania , it was called later . The first railways were promoted by men who were engaged in practical life and experienced on the spot the need for the new means of transport . They had tackled the problem like cool-headed business men , though with great courage , and they had been proved in the end to be right . The money thus spent brought a rich return . Dividends of to to 15 per cent . were no rarity . But England had become rich through her technical industry . Many were seeking to invest money , and the great bankers in London had also finally realized that there was actually money to be made out of railways . A tremendous propaganda started , everybody was trying to get rich simply by the rise in the price of shares , quite without regard to the possibilities of the undertakings or the need for them . A railway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the population . Anyone who did not speculate in railway shares was looked upon as a fool . Men and women , employers and employed , high and low , the whole mass of normally steady English people was as though seized by madness . It was no one 's duty to take any steps . The free play of forces , in which the people of England believed as in a divine law , celebrated orgies . Neither Government nor Parliament made any attempt at the time to interfere with the development . Stephenson kept his head and refused to have anything to do with this development , which he recognized as fraudulent . Father and son were pestered ; famous names were needed ? only names 1 ? and ? r , 000 was paid at the time for permission to print a name ' on the prospectus to back its rosy promises . Here again Stephenson was right . Enormous sums were thrown away . All these limitless hopes ended in complete collapse , and it was some time before decent business principles ruled in the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were very disagreeable // features . Numerous new men who knew nothing of technical work , but called themselves engineers , were pushed by the immense increase in railway work into positions for which they were entirely unfitted . Contemporary reports complain of shoddy work . Economies were made where they ought not to have been made , and the money thus saved went into private pockets ; corruption reached a degree hitherto unimaginable . The result was collapse of tunnels and bridges , and a failure of the service . Years were needed before the mistakes could be made good by sound work . The newly rich who came to the fore at this time made themselves very objectionable in English society , and all the trouble was put down to the railway which , like any human product if misused , had potentialities for evil as well as good . Stephenson , who had previously been asked to conceal the fact that he could attain a speed of twelve miles an hour , now ran his trains up to twenty and thirty , but this was not nearly enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the locomotive can travel at unlimited speeds , why not then roo miles an hour ? At this point Stephenson spoke a word of warning to the effect that the question was not how quickly in theory a locomotive could travel , but what speed would be of most advantage to the builder and user , and he warned against exceeding forty miles per hour . But , asked other people , is the steam locomotive as designed by Stephenson and others , really the last word in development ? Engineering now went through a curious phase . The eternal pressure of the atmosphere was to drive the trains much faster and more safely ! A great pipe was to be laid between the rails , and in it a piston was to move , connected to the carriage above through a slit . If the air was sucked out of the tube on one side of the piston , the latter would of course be driven along by the pressure of the air , and take with it the carriage to which it was fixed . That was the basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried into effect by a marvellous feat of engineering . How great // were the hopes that were set upon it ! Once more , only stationary engines at considerable distances apart were needed for working the air pumps , and the coal consumption would be much less for the horse-power hour . The locomotive , which is only a steam power plant on wheels , could be dispensed with . But Stephenson would have nothing to do with this idea , and never believed that it would lead to the scrapping of his steam locomotives . And time proved him in the right . At first no one was ready to believe that carriages with iron wheels running on iron rails could be driven even on the level , by turning their wheels . Friction would be much too small . Experience then showed that it was possible , but it was believed to be necessary to avoid all gradients . Stephenson himself endeavoured to do without gradients as far as possible by suitable alignment , even when large detours had to be made , costly tunnels bored , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear as compared with our present methods . In this again the young generation was sure that it knew better , and so , instead of going forward step by step , they fell over their own feet . If the maxim had previously been that railways only run on the level , the switchback system was now discovered , and it was maintained that the more hills and dales there were on the line , the better would it be for the economic running of the railway . But this fashion , too , was very short-lived ; engineers can not dictate laws to Nature . Then came a third struggle , a very serious one : the battle of the gauges . We have seen how in the mines , wooden and iron rails had been laid on which to run the ore and coal trucks . When the change was made to steam running , Stephenson did not dream of changing the gauge of the rails at great expense . Thus the gauge used in the North of England mines determined the railway gauge for the whole world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gauge suited to the new form of transport . No one had even considered the question . But now , when first-rate engineers , x86 GREAT ENGINEERS chief among them the famous Isambard Kingdom Brunel ( 18o6-1859 ) , set to work to build new railways , they began to consider whether Stephenson had really fixed the gauge for all time . People refused to be bound by such a standard , and there was a time when about seventy different gauges were in existence . At first numerous short stretches of line were built , without a thought that they would one day be joined up into a network . Stephenson pointed out repeatedly that a standard gauge must be adhered to , if intolerable difficulties were not to arise later . People would not listen to him , and so Brunel built the Great Western Railway with a broad gauge . It was then of course necessary for locomotives , carriages , and railway stations to be adapted to it . Brunel , who together with his father did great work as an engineer , could never have things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world , the Great Eastern , a romantic blunder of the first order . He also wanted to have the biggest railway and locomotives , which were to excel all others . His railway from London to the West was to be independent of every other railway , completely self-sufficient , and his promoters were agreeable . But then came , all the same , connections and cross-country lines , and all trucks had to be unloaded and reloaded at great expense , and all travellers had to change carriages . That could not go on for ever , and so this railway finally repented and went over to Stephenson 's standard gauge . When the locomotives were ordered from Stephenson for the first German railway , which was opened on December 7th , 1835 , between Nurnberg and Furth , they were ordered for a special gauge , but Stephenson built them just the same to the English standard , and wrote to say that it was the only practical one . So it was Stephenson who decided that the first German railway should have the English standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the age of fifty-nine , to withdraw more and more from business , leaving the field to his son , who had attained to such success in it . // But a Stephenson could not remain idle , so he bought some coal-mines and limestone quarries in his county , and built himself a railway there . But that was far from absorbing his energies , and the love of his early days now came to full expression . He laid out great gardens , and had round him all the animals he loved ; horses , cows , dogs and birds were those he liked best . He took an especial pride in his hothouses . Along with these he had a large country estate , and the greatest joy of his later years was his success in this line . He was delighted when it was said by the outside world that he grew the largest melons and the most wonderful cucumbers . But they worried him because they were crooked when he wanted to have them straight . Only when he grew them in glass tubes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early the importance of electric telegraphy for railways , and made use of it . He thus became one of the greatest engineers of his time . He forgot the fact that he had at first been taken at less than his true worth on account of his want of early education , but long refused to go into upper-class society . However , he finally yielded to the wishes of ministers of the Crown , who had a high opinion of him , and left behind the best possible impression of his calm , assured and ripe character . He had long ago learned to talk about other things besides locomotives . In working together with his son , his intellectual interests had acquired a wide range , and though he was no match for some in the matter of eloquence , his firmly formed personality made a strong impression . He was frequently offered a title , but he refused it , because he thought that such a rise in social status would not suit him or his work . He and his son were on excellent terms with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much he owed to these collaborators of his , and he would never have been able to do his great work if he had not had the gift of finding the right man and putting him in the right place . // He thought a great deal of practical education and training . We have one of his addresses given in the Newcastle Technical School . He never tired of recommending to the young men , none of whom had ever been as poor as he , serious work , and most of all persistence and endurance . When on August 12th , 1848 , after a short illness , he reached his allotted span , he was mourned not only in England , but far and wide outside it . He was buried in the cemetery in Chester , near his estates . His great son , who had not his father 's health , only survived him by eleven years . He became still more famous in professional circles , and beyond them , because his work spread over three continents . He was looked upon especially as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westminster Abbey , next to James Watt , and in the company of great generals , kings , and learned men . The railways , which , as the English say , are perhaps the only one of their great technical achievements in which they have not yet been rivalled , spread from England over the world . We saw how the two Stephensons helped to build railways in Belgium , France , Spain , and many other countries . The last great railway at the opening ceremony of which Robert Stephenson was able to be present , shortly before his death , was the Norwegian State Railway . In Germany , the battle for the railway was fought in the first instance by our great German industrialist Friedrich Harkort , and the economist List , who had gained his early experience with railways in America . Railway projects came into being amid furious battles and struggles on all sides . Nurnberg ? Furth , Braunschweig ? Wolfenbuttel , Diisseldorf ? Erkrath , Berlin ? Potsdam , Leipzig ? Dresden , and so on ; indeed , Cologne ? Minden was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . Everything that was said in England against railways was repeated , but above all the question : who is to pay for all that ? Where are the people to come from to use all this costly construction , and // this terrifying speed ? The first railway was the work of the Burgomaster of Nurnberg , Scharrer , and of a big merchant , Platner . The desire was to employ a German , and in Bavaria was found the engineer Camille von Denis , who had already studied railways in England and America . But the first locomotive was supplied by George Stephenson ; it was not until 1838 that Schubert built in Saxony Germany 's first locomotive . Then came the great German locomotive builders , Emil Kessler in Karlsruhe and Esslingen , and above all , August Borsig in Berlin , Georg Egestorff in Hannover , Karl Anton Henschel in Cassel , and J. Maffei in Munich . George Stephenson thus found in Germany and all other countries , again and again , famous successors , who carried on the work begun by him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their own countries and to their economic conditions . The short lengths of railway which Stephenson was at first able to build , have become gigantic networks which cover all continents . The railway became the great customer and stimulus for all industry . The short railways became great lines with branches everywhere , forming a net with meshes of ever decreasing size ; the results in all directions were many times better than those thought possible 100 years ago . The railways of the world would encircle the world thirty-two times at the equator . But whoever attempts to survey the great development still going on to-day from the point of view of its historical origin will hold George and Robert Stephenson in grateful memory . HENRY MAUDSLAY and JAMES NASMYTH 1771 ? 1831 &; 1808 ? 1890 The machine of to-day needs for its production thousands of other machines of the most varied description . This was not always the case . How much handwork was there // not still in James Watt 's steam engine ? Hammer and chisel and file were the tools of the neat-handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A forging hammer driven by a water-wheel may have helped with the forging ; a primitive lathe , copied from that of the wood-turner , could not be dispensed with . In such a workshop were further found a few small drilling machines , and when steam engines were being made , they had to have the great boring machine for the long steam cylinder . That was the whole machine equipment . But the more developed machines became , the less adequate was simple hand labour . The hand worked much too slowly and also too inexactly for the machine , which depends upon the most accurate interconnection of all its parts . Again and again in technical history one sees that it is not enough to have an idea , that it is not sufficient to work out an invention on paper . What has been thought out and drawn must be transmuted into realities of steel and iron . Many good ideas have come to grief owing to difficulties in carrying them out , and have later on come to life again when methods of manufacture have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well known to every practical man , is not sufficiently emphasized in technical histories . This lies in the fact that progress in such methods is chiefly a question of the general work of the mechanical workshop , which forms a unit ; hence the advances made do not become so widely known by patents or articles , as is the case in other branches of technical work . To this must be added that people were especially fond of keeping to themselves the progress made in methods of manufacture , in order to derive commercial profit from their superiority . A change only came about when , little by little , firms specializing in the manufacture of tools and machine tools came into existence , and took care to make widely known the improved methods of manufacture rendered possible by their products . // Another point was that the skilled workmen who were able to make machines with the help only of primitive tools were not by any means always inclined to be industrious . They felt how completely indispensable they were , and were fond of going on strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the driving forces which in the first half of the nineteenth century led , first of all in England , where such enormous progress in mechanical technology was made in this period , to the development of very many machine tools , by the help of which the production in sufficient numbers of other sorts of machines was rendered possible . So it was just the engineers working in this field who had a decisive influence on technical development . The value of their achievements can only be gauged by realizing what difficulties were to be overcome . We have the diary of such a machine builder of 176o , who on an American mine had to bore out a cast bronze cylinder for the steam engine . The process consisted in the simplest form of rubbing down with emery , and they were very proud to be able to show that the diameter of the cylinder did not vary anywhere by more than the thickness of the little finger . The master adds an expression of his great joy at having thus obtained the best possible result , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doing still better in future . The joy was justified , for they had all despaired of ever succeeding with so great a work , and it is touching to read in the diary that we give great gratitude to Almighty God , who hath brought us through such fiery tribulations to an efficient termination of our arduous labours . ' James Watt had no better fortune . He found in the great John Wilkinson a man who actually succeeded in boring a cylinder true to s in . We further learn from James Watt that all engineers of his time held it to be quite impossible to turn a piston rod by hand so accurately as to slide through a steam-tight stuffing box , at that time an entirely novel clement of construction . And what did toothed wheels look // like ? We hear of machines , the many toothed wheels of which made so monstrous a noise , that everyone thought they were bursting into pieces . The machine maker attempted to remedy the trouble , but had to admit that it was impossible to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cogs to settle their differences with one another ; they will grind themselves in time ! ' But what else could be done at a time when no machines existed for cutting toothed wheels mechanically ? At this point the engineers got to work , and in the first half of the nineteenth century brought about a Golden Age of English machine tool construction . Joseph Bramah was a Yorkshireman . Born in 1749 as the son of a peasant farmer , he too seemed destined to follow the plough , when an accident in his sixteenth year made him unfit for such work . He was then apprenticed to a carpenter , and learned to be a fine workman in wood . But he soon started inventing . He made very considerable improvements in the water-closet , then being slowly introduced , and invented the first safetylock , which kept its place for almost eighty years , till new locks were devised in America . Bramah had in the meantime settled in London , and he felt so sure of his lock that he offered a reward of ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to make these complicated safety locks with sufficient accuracy , machine tools had to be devised if they were to be made on a large scale . At this point it was Bramah 's good fortune to find in Henry Maudslay an excellent collaborator . He himself then did very successful work in connection with hydraulic piston engines . He now no longer called himself a carpenter , but a machine builder . In 1795 he obtained the famous patent for the hydraulic press , a tool which is indispensable to-day for the most varied purposes . Although Pascal had already suggested in 1664 the construction of such a press based on physical principles , practical success in carrying out his plan was only attained 130 years later . Robert Stephenson could not get his great bridges // erected without the help of this hydraulic press , and Brunel used it to launch his giant ship the Great Eastern . The hydraulic press then replaced the large steam hammer for forging , and has done great work up till to-day . Very great difficulties had to be overcome in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew how to provide the plunger with a water-tight packing able to resist great pressure . The solution of this problem was found by Maudslay . He arranged for the water pressure itself to put sufficient force on the leather packing , which was formed like the turned-back cuff of a coat , to make a tight joint round the plunger . Bramah designed a number of other valuable machines , among them the wood planer . Indeed he worked in quite other fields , as was still possible at that time . He built great new works in the last decade of the eighteenth century . He made machines for sawing marble , and devised new methods of building bridges and canal locks . He died , famous as an engineer , on December 9th , 1814 , in his sixty-sixth year . A great number of remarkable engineers came from his workshop . We have already mentioned Henry Maudslay , who was born in Woolwich on August 22nd , 1771 . His father was employed in the Royal Arsenal , and the boy had to set about earning money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of twelve , and then helped in loading cartridges with powder . But two years later he was put in the joiner 's shop , where his father was also employed , and here he first learned to work in wood and iron . He was fond of telling in later years how greatly he was attracted by work in the smithy , and how he much preferred using hammer , chisel , and file to saw and plane . This desire was finally fulfilled , and he was soon a master of the smith 's art . His co-workers admired him , and he was known in London workshops for his manual skill . We saw how he came to Bramah in London , and played a decisive part in the great success of the latter 's workshops . // But here there was at first a great difficulty to be overcome . Maudslay had not gone through the seven years apprenticeship demanded for the workshops . He offered , however , to carry out a piece of work which had beaten the other men in the shop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as capable of working on an even footing with the others . Maudslay had grown into a big strong man . With his height of six foot two , his round face with its merry eyes and firm mouth , the impression he made on his fellows was such that he was always chosen as standard-bearer in ceremonial processions . When he was technical head of Bramah 's works he was still earning not more than 30s. a week . When he pointed out that he had now some claim to a slightly larger income , his modest suggestion was so scornfully rejected that he determined to start in business on his own account . In 1797 he opened a small mechanical workshop and smithy in London . Little by little orders came in , and his fame as one of the most skilful metal workers of England was soon so firmly founded that he was presented with harder and harder problems . He not only knew what exact work meant for machine construction , but actually loved this exact work as an expression of his whole nature . He recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself had to hold and guide the tool as in woodturning , and needed great physical strength for the job , would never turn out sufficiently true work . For this reason he was already pondering , while with Bramah , the problem of how to make a self-acting lathe , in which not only the holding of the tool , but its guidance also , should be taken care of by the machine . He thus arrived at a lathe in which the support to which the tool was fixed was traversed by a lead-screw driven from the machine . We know that this idea had been suggested before Maudslay 's time in France , where there were very skilful workmen ; it had already been published in 1772 . But Maudslay knew nothing of this , and his solution was // essentially different , for it served to fulfil very exact practical conditions ; he is thus rightly regarded as the creator of the self-acting lathe , which was used for decades in all countries under the name of the English lathe . ' It became the universal tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of purposes , before special machines were designed . This wonderful machine tool was now followed by a great number of other machines , which replaced step by step the laborious and rare skill of human hands . Maudslay then built for certain purposes a number of other special machines , by means of which he was able to turn out certain parts in great numbers , and in a form not hitherto considered possible . Maudslay had very early made great efforts to improve the making of screws . At that time screws were made by hand . Small ones were filed , larger ones were worked by hammer and chisel . But that was so difficult that screws were only made use of where absolutely necessary . Otherwise wedges were employed , such as are used in woodconstruction . Of the few screws made , every one with its nut was a separate individual with its own special form . One favoured one form of thread and pitch , another another form , and so no two screws were alike . The screw and its own nut had both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interchanging them . When the screws got mixed up , there was trouble with a vengeance . When we think of our cars to-day , this state of affairs is beyond our powers of imagination . Maudslay saw that this could not go on . He showed the way as well , and one of his great pupils , Joseph Whitworth , solved the problem in a fundamental fashion . 11 is name lives on to-day in his system of threads . Maudslay was a great constructor . One might say of him as of James Watt , that he possessed the wonderful faculty of knowing what could be left out . He always arrived by a touch of genius at the simplest solution of a problem . He not only built machine tools ; he was famous for his excellent steam engines built for driving factories , and above all for // his great marine engines , which he constructed with hitherto unexampled accuracy for both merchant- and warships . He always set great store by practical work . Whoever could satisfy him on this score was befriended and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great stress on avoiding sharp angles and corners in his cast- and wrought-iron parts . He had a feeling for the material , and knew that sharp edges such as are usual in the work of carpenter and joiner , are not to be introduced into ironwork . But it was a long time before he educated his co-workers up to using the forms he required . He used to hold out his hand to them in the workshop , and point out how Nature had joined the fingers to the palm of the hand by rounded curves , or he took the man to the nearest tree and showed him that there are no sharp corners between trunk and branches . On holidays he was accustomed to go through the empty shops with a piece of chalk from bench to bench . He looked carefully to see whether the tools were well looked after and arranged so as to be ready to the hand . He examined the work itself very closely , and his laconic remarks written in chalk on the bench or the work , by way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the owner of the whole factory was the most skilled workman in it . But Maudslay was not submerged in his professional work . He was a friendly person who liked talking to people , without , however , allowing much interruption to his work in his own shops . He loved music , and had acquired a number of musical boxes , which were kept in an adjoining room , and delighted him by their tunes when he was at work . The fame of his work spread far beyond the shores of England . He received many distinguished visitors . We know for example that he showed Faraday over his workshop , and that the latter had the greatest admiration for what he saw . Maudslay came to Berlin in the course of his travels , having to install the machines in the Royal Mint ( 183o ) . Here he met Humboldt and Schinkel , whom he much admired . But it was the Berlin Observatory which fascinated // him most of all , and his last great wish was to make himself a similar great telescope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on February 14th , 1831 , and is buried at his birthplace , Woolwich , in which his early years were passed and of which he was very fond . His work was carried on by his pupils , to whom he was able methodically to communicate the riches of his experience . One of the most distinguished of these men was the Scotsman James Nasmyth . His family can be traced back in Scotland to the thirteenth century . The Nasmyths were brave warriors in the never-ending Border wars , and they knew how to value a good sword as a piece of craftsmanship . The father of James Nasmyth came from a family of craftsmen . By day he painted wagon bodies for a wagon builder , while by night he visited an art school in order to learn painting . He went to London , but returned to his home town Edinburgh , where he earned a modest but steady income as a portrait painter . The son said of his father that he could sit any saddle : he was at the same time painter , architect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his workshop , and there the son learned while young to handle tools . James was the youngest child of four sons and seven daughters . He was born on August 19th , 18o8 , in Edinburgh . At the age of nine he met James Watt , then eighty-two years of age , in Edinburgh , and the recollection of this meeting was treasured by him all his life . He also knew Walter Scott , and the many noteworthy friends of his father taught him much . His schooling came to an end at the age of twelve . We know that he was no friend of the dead languages , but was interested in mathematics and natural science , and loved drawing . He loved the eloquence of the pencil ' as he called it . A school friend brought him when only a boy into the closest contact with ironworks , and there he learned , us he tells us in his autobiography , very much that served him all through his life . He also spent some years at // Edinburgh University . When he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for quite a long time . But now he saw that it was time to lay a sure foundation for the calling of a machine builder . He heard Maudslay praised as one of England 's greatest builders of machines , and at once resolved to go to him . But that was easier said than done , for Maudslay had a dislike for the sons of rich fathers who were apt , when taken as practical pupils , merely to pretend to work . He wanted apprentices . But Nasmyth was able to show him drawings and sketches which had such an effect on Maudslay 's sharp eyes that he even took him as his private assistant into his own workshop with its wonderful and extremely accurate tools . He started work with Maudslay on May 30th , 1829 . His wages were 10s. a week , and he managed to live on that sum . Nasmyth gives enthusiastic expression to his admiration and reverence for his master . He was greatly impressed by Maudslay 's love of his work , and repeatedly astonished at his intuitive sense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meaning of accurate measuring instruments . Since all such instruments then commonly in use were too weak in their design , Maudslay had constructed a very strong one , and had thereby raised the accuracy to a thousandth of an inch . After Maudslay 's death Nasmyth remained with the partner in the firm , J. Field , and built with him Zoo-h.p. steam engines for a water-works . But then a strong desire for independence came to him . Field willingly lent him his aid , and allowed him to copy the best lathe in the workshop . Nasmyth first returned to his home in Edinburgh . There he set up a modest little workshop , in which the lathe was driven from a wheel turned by a workman . He then travelled around in England , and thought of settling in Liverpool or Manchester , where the railway was , which he had visited shortly after its inauguration , when the elder Stephenson drove the locomotive while his son acted as fireman . Nasmyth was // now twenty-six years old and had so high a reputation that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large sum at low interest without asking for security . ' Nasmyth began his work in a large inn in Manchester . Orders soon came in , the machine tools were soon fully occupied ; the small smithy in the cellar was already crowded out . So he made up his mind to build a works of his own near Manchester , where the beginning of railway construction was most favourable to such development . But Nasmyth soon had to find much fault with his workmen . They took a holiday not only on Monday , but most of them on Tuesday as well , and considered it enough to turn up to work on the Wednesday . They had drunk away their wages in the three days of idleness . Convinced that they were indispensable , they were ill-behaved when at work , and very difficult to keep in order . These facts , so Nasmyth thought , greatly contributed to the further development of automatic machines and to their introduction into the shops in spite of their high cost . For he could say of them : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from excess ; they were never absent from work ; they did not strike for wages ; they were unfailing in their accuracy and regularity , while producing the most delicate or ponderous portions of mechanical structures . ' Every new machine was the best recommendation for further orders . Nasmyth then acquired very cheaply a ninety-nine-years lease of a further plot of land lying directly on the railway line from Liverpool to Manchester , and near the great canal . He thus had no need to tie up capital in order to set up his first works . Nasmyth , who was a great lover of nature , was well pleased with the surrounding country , and delighted in the orchards , trees , and meadows . He was greatly affected by the way in which the wonderful countryside was being ruined by the rapid rise of industry . We may fill our purses , but we pay a heavy price for it in the loss of picturesqueness and beauty . ' Zoo GREAT ENGINEERS He soon got orders for steam engines ; even yet it was not possible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . In 1838 Nasmyth devised the safety pouring ladle for casting metal , in which the ladle was operated by a screw and toothed wheel . His business extended , and many rich people were now anxious to put in money as sleeping partners . But he would have nothing to do with the idea . He found in Gaskell an excellent business man , whom he willingly took as an active partner and worked with for sixteen years in the closest and most friendly manner . Difficult times came along ; again and again the fight with the trade unions gave him much trouble . The unions strove remorselessly for power , even in the individual works , and Nasmyth would have nothing whatever to do with the idea . When on one occasion a strike took place , he fetched sixty excellent workmen from Scotland , who arrived complete with their families , and were given steady and well-paid work . The machines ordered from Nasmyth became larger and larger . He built locomotives , which had a high reputation ; he built marine engines , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told their troubles to him . They were unable to make the huge shaft , at the ends of which the two great paddle-wheels were to be fixed ; it had to be 30 in. in thickness , and how were they going to forge it ? Existing hammers were not nearly powerful enough . The problem took hold of Nasmyth , and after some thought he hit upon a stroke of genius . He fixed a steam cylinder vertically on the top of a strong A-shaped frame , and had the piston-rod pointing downwards with a heavy hammer-head fixed to it . The steam was admitted under the piston and lifted the hammer , which then fell down again on the forging . A master of the art of sketching , he immediately recorded the idea in his sketch-book . The steam hammer , that indispensable tool , was present in his mind 's eye with every detail of its control gear . He proposed to build it and forge // the 3o-in. shaft . But then screw-propulsion was decided upon , and the propeller-shaft , which revolves at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's steam hammer was no longer necessary . It was a period of decline in business activity , and no one thought of spending money on new tools . Nasmyth had also other matters to worry about , and the steam hammer was put aside for a time . Many visitors came to see him , including foreigners , and it is said that one of the great French engineers also visited his works when he was absent , that Gaskell showed him everything there was to see , including Nasmyth 's sketch-books , and that the Frenchman was thus enabled to copy his hammer . When Nasmyth went to France some time later , the famous Creusot works showed him some wonderful forgings made by his steam hammer . He returned home very well pleased , for he was now able to point out to the English industry that his steam hammer was already in use on a large scale in France . It was decided in 1842 to take out a patent and build the hammer , which very soon proved itself a wonderful tool . All who saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it was controlled . It could be used for the lightest forging , or made to deliver blows which shook the entire neighbourhood . When Alfred Krupp had set up his famous giant hammer Fritz , it made an unforgettable impression on visitors when it was caused to descend at full speed on to a watch laid on the anvil , without doing more than cracking the glass . Nasmyth soon made use of his hammer for driving piles , and is thus the inventor of the steam pile-driver . His business connections took him all over Europe . He travelled in France and Italy , and saw much more than the factories to which he was desirous of selling his machines . In Italy he went to Herculaneum and Pompeii ; he never passed a museum unvisited , and always brought home with him wonderful sketches . He was an enthusiastic lover of technical work , saying that : // It is one of the most delightful results of the possession of the constructive faculty , that one can build up in the mind mechanical structures and set them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details performing their respective functions , as if they were in absolute material form and action . Unless this happy faculty exists ab initio in the brain of the mechanical engineer , he will have a hard and disappointing life before him . It is the early cultivation of the imagination which gives the right flexibility to the thinking faculties . Thus business , commerce and mechanics are all the better for a little healthy imagination . ' One of his journeys took him in 1842 to Nurnberg . Though his negotiations with the Nurnberg-Furth railway came to nothing , this in no way diminished his enthusiasm for the old town . He calls Albrecht Durer the greatest artist who ever lived : a universal genius ? painter , sculptor , mathematician and engineer . He was for Germany what Leonardo da Vinci was for Italy . Nasmyth visited Durer 's grave and there found on a bronze tablet the following inscription : Durer. 8 April 1528 emigravit . ' This he held to express an especially great truth , that the true artist can not die ; he does but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and admired the wonderful achievements of Adam Krafft , calling his famous sacristy a wonderful work . Krafft worked on it for over five years with two labourers , and was only paid 770 gulden for the work . A year later we find Nasmyth in St. Petersburg . Locomotives were wanted there too , but the Tsar wished to build them himself , and Nasmyth received large orders for machine tools . He was well received everywhere ; specially memorable for him was his visit to the observatory , where he stayed over two months . We are again and again stirred when we see how much a man like Nasmyth sees and experiences . He also visited Sweden and inspected the famous iron mines . Machine construction in England increased continually ; wherever he went he saw his own designs , often copied // faithfully without permission . But he overcame his annoyance , and remarked humorously that it was a sort of lefthanded recognition . Nasmyth 's whole mental make-up was obviously such as to lead him , in his enthusiasm for art and science , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivated with care . He was particularly fond of drawing . His charming fairytale pictures found many friends . Sometimes people were unwilling to believe that these products of a glowing imagination originated in the man who created the steam hammer and the ram . But his favourite occupation was to watch the stars at night after the day 's work , for he had inherited from his father a love of astronomy . He had built a small telescope in 1827 , and infected his teacher Maudslay with his passion for the stars . By virtue of his mechanical gifts he was able to build himself ever larger and more powerful telescopes . He had one set up in his garden , and all his guests were invited to admire the heavens through it . From 1842 on he began a methodical scientific investigation of the moon . He used his great gift for drawing to record what he saw by means of black and white chalk on grey paper set alongside the telescope . It was thus that his pictures of the moon , so famous in their day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Edinburgh in the rooms of a large scientific society . The famous astronomer Herschel , Faraday , and many others were so delighted with them that they arranged for their exhibition at the first World Exhibition in 1851 . Nasmyth was given a prize and invited to show them to the Queen and Prince Consort . Soon astronomy became his chief occupation , much more than a mere hobby . He also busied himself with the microscope at that time ; and he took so much delight in the science , which his technical work had endowed with such important tools , that he determined to retire from business in 1856 , at the age of forty-eight . He wished to spend the evening of his life , as he called // it , in active leisure . He removed to Kent , and took with him all the material things which had become especially dear to him through the joy in his work , such as his telescope , his own tools , and many other things that he had made himself . All these treasures were given a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to his beautiful house . At that time he wished for the introduction of the custom of burying with men the tools they most loved , as in the past the weapons of the warrior . For he had so often seen such things unfeelingly scattered to the four winds , after the death of their owners . Much as he loved working in his workshop , much as he loved contemplating the secrets of the heavens through his telescope , he loved equally well to be in his garden . He planted his trees and was proud of his flowers . And now , having retired from business , he began a thorough investigation of the sun . Some of his discoveries received high recognition from professional astronomers . In the meantime photography had advanced so far that he was able to take direct photographs of the moon . So the years went by , until he too had to take leave of the great life of creative work which he had enjoyed for eighty-two years .

JOHN ERICSSON 1803 ? 1889 Sweden has produced great engineers , whose work is with justice given one of the first places in the new technical museum at Stockholm . We may mention here Christopher Polhem , the great mechanic and master of arts , ' clockmaker , and canal builder , who was born at Wisby in 1661 and died in his ninetieth // year in Stockholm in 1751 . He produced masterpieces in the most varied technical fields , but specially in mining and metallurgy . Further , John Ericsson , who looks down upon us from his monuments in Stockholm and Washington , and de Laval ( 1845 to 1913 ) , the great inventor and designer , to whom we owe , beside many other first-rate achievements in metallurgy , the milk centrifuge and the impulse steam turbine . We will describe more fully the life and work of John Ericsson . Ericsson was born on July 31st , 1803 , in Warmland , in the centre of Sweden . His forefathers had been mining folk since the seventeenth century . They are described to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honest , faithful unto death . His father was a mining engineer . At twenty-one years of age he was already in charge of a mine as technical director . Ericsson inherited from him his enthusiasm for technical work , and from his mother , tall , slim , and beautiful , with bright blue eyes , he inherited his noble outlook and strong character . There were three children of the marriage ; in 1800 a daughter was born , and in 1802 his brother Niels who ? here we anticipate ? entered the engineering side of the Swedish Navy . He built the new locks on the Trollhattan Canal , the docks in Stockholm , and great canals . The Swedish Parliament confided to him , in 1853 , the task of laying out the chief lines of the Swedish State Railways . Niels Ericsson is regarded as the creator of the Swedish railway system . He died in 1870 in Stockholm . Sweden honoured him for his technical achievements by the grant of a title . Little John passed the happy years of childhood among the mining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to study the machines , to draw them , and to ask his father and the officials to explain them to him in every detail . He began here to lay the foundation of his great engineering achievements . War came with Russia in 1811 to 1814 , Finland was lost , industry and trade suffered very heavily , many rich
