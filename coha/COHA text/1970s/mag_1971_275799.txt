JOE COLOMBO 'S civic career is a recent development . Until he organized the Italian-American Civil Rights League , he was a much more private person , intent on following his father 's profession . Anthony Colombo was a successful Brooklyn mobster until he was garroted one night in 1938 in the back seat of his car along with his girl friend . The killing forced young Joe to quit high school and go to work in a printing plant to support his mother and younger sister . He enlisted in the Coast Guard in World War II , but he got into so much trouble that he was treated for psychoneurosis in a hospital and given a medical discharge . He collected a disability allowance of $11.50 a month . <P> <P> Returning to Brooklyn , Colombo drifted into a life of petty crime under the shadow of the Mafia . By Mafioso standards , Colombo was not much of a success . He failed to compile the kind of record that would mark him for bigger things . For a while he served as a muscleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was given a promotion of sorts when he was appointed to a five-man assassination squad under the direction of Mafia Boss Joe Profaci . Also on the team were the Gallo brothers : Larry and Crazy Joe . <P> According to police , the group performed efficiently , disposing of some 15 troublesome victims until in 1959 they were ordered to murder one of their own gang . They obeyed their instructions , but afterward they thought it over . If Profaci could eliminate one of them , what about the rest ? The Gallos committed the unthinkable : they rebelled against their Mafia boss . Not only that , they kidnaped five Profaci henchmen , holding them captive until the boss agreed to give them a bigger piece of the action . The solemn agreement lasted until the hostages were released . Then a fierce three-year gang war broke out . Before it was over , nine mobsters had been killed . 15 were wounded and three disappeared . <P> Remaining loyal to Profaci but keeping as quiet as possible , Colombo escaped from the wars unscathed-but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned to ambush him on his way home from the country club where he regularly played golf . Somehow , he got word and took another route . <P> Eventually , Colombo engineered a truce between the warring Mafia factions . At the same time he added to his power in another way . Two of the Mafia bosses , Joe Bonanno and Joe Magliocco , decided to let a contract for the extinction of three of their rivals : Carlo Gambino and Thomas Lucchese of New York City , and Slefano Magaddino of Buffalo . Who should be picked for the job but enterprising Joe <P> Colombo ? In this case , however , Joe thought the victims would be worth more to him than the contract . So he tipped them off . Bonanno made his hasty , celebrated disappearance and the " Bananas War " got under way . Some seven mobsters were slain , but once again Colombo escaped with profit . <P>
