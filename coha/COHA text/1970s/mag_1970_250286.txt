It was a year to make Yale 's fundraisers quit . Along with an invasion by more than 500 undergraduate coeds , the school suffered its first student strike , a mass occupation by white activists and Black Panthers , and stern words by Spiro Agnew urging the replacement of Yale President Kingman Brewster Jr . One volunteer fund-raising officer resigned and threatened that he would urge his classmates to stop giving if Brewster did not resign too . Meantime , Yale 's would-be contributors suffered as the stock market plunged . <P> As the fund-raisers balanced the books last week , though , it turned out that Yale alumni had kept the faith . Apparently still satisfied with Brewster 's stewardship , they had forked over $4,643,322 , the biggest sum ever raised by Yale 's annual alumni fund campaign-or that of any other American university .
