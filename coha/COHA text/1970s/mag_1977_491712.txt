I believe that last year we did better than ever . If we want to stay on TV , I know they 'll have to be better still next year . " I believe I would want to do exactly what I have done . I was privileged to be very poor , which gave me the incentive to learn how to work .

You go to the dressing room , put on the makeup , you 're out on the set , on location . They 're stopping traffic , you hop in the car , pull out the gun , chase the guy , and beat up the stunt men who ca n't beat you up .
