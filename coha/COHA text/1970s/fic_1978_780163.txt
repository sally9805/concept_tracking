 | me . Why are you so interested in this ? " " I do n't know . It 's exciting , I guess . Having someone you know get murdered without being close enough to see it as a tragedy . " " But it 's very sordid . I mean , Fleckstein sounds like a really slimy guy . " " I know . That 's what makes it fun . " " Judith ! " " Well , it 's a change from Sesame Street and chicken pot pies . " " Is that what we 're having for dinner ? " he asked , his voice filled with dread . " No , " I sighed , " lamb chops . " Stretching the telephone cord , I opened the freezer and took out a package of lamb chops . " Look , I have to run . I 'm having lunch with Charlie Leboyer .

They see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his violent , sadistic treatment of his girlfriends by planting newspaper articles about his warm family life . I hung up the phone and concentrated on the Fleckstein case . I really did n't understand it . The Mafia is simply not one of my areas of expertise . American political history , of course . Some macroeconomics . A little Shakespeare . Bette Davis movies . But the Mafia ? A group of tight-lipped men with diamond pinky rings and white-on-white shirts who paid off legions of equally tacky politicians and distributed heroin by remote control . Something sounded wrong . I called Bob on his private line . " Me . If Fleckstein was going to be indicted , it means he was n't testifying against the Mafia . " " Judith , I have a lunch date and I have to get to the club for a quick workout first . " " Come on . " " Well , I do n't know . I guess you 're right . Let me try to remember what Clay said . " I waited . " From what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he was n't talking or anything . " " So if he was n't testifying against the Mafia , why would they kill him ? " " I do n't know . Judith ... " " And they do n't stab people . They 'd gun him down . They would have booby-trapped his car . Or cut off his balls and carved a black hand on his chest and left him on his front doorstep . " " Maybe . But what 's so important about this ? He 's dead . " " I do n't know . It 's not so nice to kill . It offends me. "  | make phone calls . " That 's unfair . And I sent a check to CARE . It 's just that this is close to home . " " Not close to my home , " he declared .

" At least he had n't told me not to worry my pretty little head about other people 's dirty laundry . Although in reality that 's exactly what he had said . Bob only wanted me to worry about his dirty laundry . And his dinner . And to make sure his children were carefully tended . It 's not that he wanted a robot , a smiling automaton to make his bed and giggle on cue ; he enjoyed what he called my " intellect . " I could comprehend his business problems , appreciate his latest press release , savor with him the courtship of a new client . And I could be trotted out to dinner with a wide range of business contacts and never make an ass of myself . During political conventions , I could remind him who were the two vice-presidential candidates in 1956 . In short , a pleasure to have around , a housekeeper of reasonably pleasing countenance guaranteed not to steal , an accomplished lover with hips as fast as lightning . " Mommy , the doorbell . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I called , and strolled to the door . Kate was n't due home for another fifteen minutes . " Mrs. Judith Singer ? " the man on my doorstep asked . I gripped the knob and peered at him . Blue-eyed , about my age , with crisply cut short hair . He smiled with a mouth full of bright , white teeth . Very good-looking . Totally unappealing . " Yes , I 'm Judith Singer . " " Sorry to bother you , ma'am , but we 're investigating the murder of Bruce Fleckstein . Dr. Fleckstein . I know Sergeant Ramirez spoke to you , but there are just a couple of things we 'd like cleared up . He showed me his ID : Detective Steven Christopher Smith . " I 'd like to ask you a few questions . Is this a convenient time for you ? " " Of course . Please come in. "  | SMITH STEPPED INTO THE HOUSE . " Do you happen to know where Mrs. Tuccio does her shopping ? " His voice was gentle , soothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the family some sad news about their loved one . " Shopping ? " " For groceries , ma'am . " " I do n't know . I guess Waldbaum 's or the A &P.; They 're the closest . " " Mrs. Tuccio never mentioned where she shops ? " My relationship with Marilyn was obviously less intimate than the police had assumed . " No , she never did . " " I see . Well , ma'am , would you happen to know the time of day Mrs. Tuccio went shopping ? " " No . " I paused , concentrating on Smith 's plump , pink cheeks . " Are you trying to establish some sort of alibi ? " " I really ca n't say , Mrs. Singer . " " Look , t his is silly . Marilyn Tuccio would n't be interested in a man like Dr. Fleckstein . It was a professional relationship . I went to see him a few years ago and all he was interested in was my gums . I 'm sure it was the same with Marilyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file . Could I ask you a few more questions , now that I 'm here ? " I nodded . " During your visit , did you ever see Dr. Fleckstein in angry conversation with anyone ? " " No , " I said apologetically . I wished I could help him . " Well , do you recall seeing him answering the telephone and becoming upset ? " " No . " .. Did he say anything significant to you ? " " He told me to use unwaxed dental floss. "  | " I see , " Smith said . " Mrs. Singer , when we investigate a murder , we have to look at all aspects of the deceased 's life . Do you have any reason to believe that Dr. Fleckstein was keeping company with other women ? " I must have looked startled , because he explained : " It 's just a routine question , but it 's important . " I stepped back a few inches and cleared my throat . " Well , I 've heard some rumors about him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I ca n't . I just heard he was quite a ladies ' man . " " Ma'am , I want to assure you that this is a confidential investigation . We just want to get to the bottom of this . " He was wearing a navy peacoat , and a thin line of perspiration had appeared on his upper lip . " Would you like to take your coat off ? " " No , thank you . Did you happen to hear who Dr. Fleckstein was having an affair with ? " " I do n't like to spread rumors . " " We 'll check everything out very discreetly , ma'am . We do n't want anybody to get hurt . " " I heard he was carrying on with his nurse , Lorna Lewis . But it 's pure , unadulterated gossip and I have no way of knowing if it 's true . " Not a flicker of interest ; his blond eyelashes did n't even blink . " I see you 've already heard that , " I observed . The perspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really comment on that , Mrs. Singer . " " Okay . Anything else ? " " To the best of your recollection , have you heard any other information about Dr. Fleckstein or his associates or family ? " I pondered that for a minute , debating whether to mention Fleckstein 's Mafia link . But the police must have known , and it would be in Newsday the next morning . " No , I ca n't think of anything . As I said , I saw him years ago , and only for one visit . " Smith thanked me . I went to open the door for him and noticed Joey , leaning against the wall , observing us both . " Do you want to be a policeman when you grow up ? " Smith asked . " No , " Joey snapped back . " No way . " " Joey , " I said aghast . " What kind of way is that to talk ? " " That 's all right , ma'am , " Smith said softly . " Goodbye , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Joey turned his back and stomped up the stairs . Kate came in a few minutes later , her overalls covered with green paint , traces of it on her nose and cheeks . " I was painting today , " she explained .  | " I see that . " " It 's really a mess , " she observed cheerfully . " Where 's Joey ? " " In his room , playing records . " She considered that for a moment , entwining a stubby , green-tipped finger in her smooth , dark braid . " Would you like a glass of milk ? " I asked . " No . I 'll see if Joey wants some company . Thanks anyway . " I smiled as she pranced upstairs , hoping that they could spend the afternoon together in relative peace . Two minutes passed without any screams of protest , no sound of toys or bodies being hurled against the door . I walked into the living room and curled up on the couch , and tried to put things in order . The police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the women would say that Fleckstein propositioned them . A few of the men might say he liked the Jets or that he seemed fascinated by wheat futures . But I could n't imagine any patient having solid information on Fleckstein . He was one of those professionals clever enough to make small conversation with a patient , so you 'd feel comfortable enough to return instead of going elsewhere to have your gums deflated . But my instincts were that he had no depth , no substance , the type who could play tennis with a man for eight years and never ask where the man grew up . " Great stuff , honey , " he 'd say to a woman he 'd just slept with ; he 'd call her " honey " because he could n't quite remember whether her name was Joan or Jean or Jane . And he did n't want to offend . Fleckstein wanted her to feel comfortable enough to come back again . But there had to be more to Marvin Bruce than this , because men just like him live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Florida golf course . Even though I had barely known him , he did n't seem the sort to get involved enough with someone so that she would care enough to kill him . A forty-two-year-old man still slim enough to wear tight , streaky , French-cut jean suits and a gold ID bracelet on a hairy wrist would normally grow old gracefully , metamorphosing into khaki leisure outfits and ultimately into navy blazers with silk ascots to hide his crepey neck . The more I considered , the more certain I became that Fleckstein had a secret life . Not a hot little blond number tucked away in an apartment in Queens . Certainly not a cool , secret connection with the CIA or FBI . Men like Fleckstein , bourgeois to the soul , lack moral and physical courage ; their patriotism extends to standing for " The Star-Spangled Banner " at a baseball game . But from what Bob had gleaned from Claymore Kati , Fleck-  | stein had become involved in a very dirty business with some very dirty people . A normal suburbanite will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man like Fleckstein find himself so deeply enmeshed ? Why would a dentist with a practice good for over a hundred thousand a year find himself , on the verge of a criminal indictment , with a fatal wound in the base of his skull ? He seemed so ordinary , just another thread in the community fabric . We ate at the same restaurants , sent our children to the same schools , probably used the same plumber . But he was dead . Bathing Joey : Did Fleckstein die for his sins ? The moment he felt the murder weapon piercing the soft skin covering his medulla , did he regret trying to become a mogul of the porno pix biz ? Bathing Kate : Did he see who killed him ? Was it one of his women ? Did he have one last pang that somehow he had n't satisfied her completely ? Making dinner : Had it hurt ? At the table : trying to discuss my musings with Bob . " Judith , can we please change the subject ? " " Why ? This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I looked at them , Kate peering at Bob and me , intent on our conversation , Joey rummaging through the fruit bowl , a large bunch of grapes on his plate , untouched . " Do n't you want to watch television ? Maybe I Love Lucy is on ? " Joey bolted and ran for the den . Kate looked at me quizzically , knowing that I must be truly desperate to allow them this boon . " But , Mommy , you said that I Love Lucy rots your mind . " " Only if you watch it all the time . Once a month is okay . " She clutched her half-eaten pear and shuffled out of the dining room . A great tactical coup , but now the enemy was on the alert . There would be no way , short of swinging a machete near his groin , that I could get Bob to discuss the Fleckstein case with me . I had been too animated . I had n't asked him about his day . I had n't told him about mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Enough about this murder business . You do n't mind that I sent the children downstairs ? I just wanted some time alone together . " He gave me his cute little self-effacing smile , where he cocks his head to one side and lowers his eyes . He always smiles like that when caught in the midst of a triumph , like when he told his parents that the Turner Ammunition and Armaments account just fell into his lap , or when he informed me that the thousand dollars I had n't wanted him to invest in Vitachill Cryonics was , at that very moment , worth five thousand .  | " Tell me about your day , " he said graciously . " Oh . It was nice . " I smiled at him . " Marilyn Tuccio has a great new recipe for apple crisp . " Ile nodded and squeezed a section of the orange he was eating . A pit slid out onto his plate . " That 's nice . " We smiled warmly at each other . Bob said : " A wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ droppings if they were surrounded by watercress and served with a dry white wine . The phone rang . " I 'll get it , " he said wearily . " It 's probably for me . " He stood and sauntered into the kitchen . " Hello , " he said . " Oh , fine . Great . How are you doing ? Yes . Judith 's right here . Nice speaking with you . " He covered the mouthpiece with his hand and made a sour face . " It 's Malice . " Mary Alice Mahoney is the most excruciatingly boring human being I know . One of those dormitory acquaintances whom you forget within minutes of graduation , she had moved to Shorehaven two years before . It took her only a month to discover that Nancy and I were living in town . " Nancy ! Judith ! " she squealed across the high school auditorium during a particularly vituperative meeting over a proposed sewage disposal bond . " You live here ! " We nodded wearily and watched as she squeezed past a row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Her thin , boyish body and blonde pixie haircut had not changed since 1963 . Only her clothing had altered , from knee socks and pleated skirts to the suburban alphabet potpourri  --  entwined Gs on her handbag , Ys on the vamps of her shoes , double Bs on her sweater . She offered a cheek for each of us to kiss . " Old friends are the best friends . Right ? Right , Judith ? Right , Nancy ? " Mary Alice thought nothing of arriving uninvited for a " little chat . " She would ring my doorbell on the average of once every two weeks and invariably ask the same question : " Busy ? " Unlike Nancy , I never had the courage to say yes . She had the gift of reducing every subject to its tritest common denominator . Once , Nancy and I were discussing a mutual college friend , a woman who had left her husband and was now living in Manhattan with another woman ; she had made the transition from Wisconsin farm girl to faculty wife to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nancy and I were wondering if this could possibly be so . " Lucy Anderson is a lesbian ? " Mary Alice asked . We nodded . " Well , homosexuality is not an evil . " We agreed . " They just ca n't help themselves . " Before we had a chance to moan with boredom , we received a fervent defense of Mary Alice 's hairdresser ,  | whom we 'd never even dreamed of attacking , a list of Gay People in the Seven Lively Arts , plus the collected experiences of her three sisters , Mary Elizabeth , Mary Therese , and Mary Jeanne , and their dealings with gays . When Nancy delicately pointed out that her sisters , saints though they may be , were not germane to the subject being discussed , Mary Alice smiled a small , sad smile and said : " I think you 're being very judgmental . My sisters are relevant to me . " Bob , who generally likes my friends in direct proportion to their resemblance to the Platonic ideal of the happy homemaker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he offered to shake hands with her , she asked : " Are you doing this as one human being to another or because you think it 's what I , as a liberated woman , expect ? " He handed me the phone as if a moist , green fungus had sprouted on the receiver . " Hi , Mary Alice , " I said , trying not to sound too encouraging . " Judith , I 've just got to talk to you . " She still had a midwestern accent and pronounced each word separately , as though each was a distinct idea in itself . " Please . " " Sure . " " Not on the phone . It 's very personal . Do you possibly have a free minute tomorrow ? " By Mary Alice 's standards , it was probably something momentous . Maybe her son 's gym teacher , with whom she had been exchanging meaningful glances for a year and a half , had told her she looked cute . Should she tell him he looked cute ? And was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for a signal from women ? " I 'm really busy , Mary Alice . " " I know you are . You 're so bright . But this is very urgent . It 's about the murder . " " The murder ? " I sounded incredulous because I could n't believe that Mary Alice could be even remotely connected with anything interesting . " Please , Judith . " " Oh , of course . Sure . What time do you want to come over ? " " Could you possibly come over here ? " Tedious , limited , vacuous , but endowed with a great , manipulative genius . " All right . I 'll be over about nine-fifteen . " " Could you make it nine-thirty ? " she asked . " I meditate till nine-twenty . " I agreed . For a moment , I considered being cool and hanging up with a quick " See you tomorrow . " But the pressure of curiosity forced me to continue . " Did you know Fleckstein ? "  | " Yes , Judith , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . " In the Biblical sense , if you know what I mean . " Stunned , I looked around the dining room , trying to reestablish some sense of reality . Bob had gone downstairs to play in his darkroom . I stared at a very real-looking lamb chop bone . Mary Alice and Fleckstein ? How could Mary Alice , for whom the postman 's visit is an opportunity for an intimate discussion , how could she have even met Bruce Fleckstein and withheld her knowledge from Nancy and me ? " And I 'm going to ask you a personal favor , Judith . Please call Nancy and tell her to come with you . I 'd call her myself , but I know she does n't like me . " " Oh , come on , Mary Alice , " I said , embarrassed by being confronted with the truth . " No , it 's true . But I think we have a great deal of respect for each other 's intelligence , and I would appreciate her comments on the situation . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak on the phone . I 'll see you tomorrow . " Probably she just wants to play the grief-stricken lover , to sob in silence  --  in front of me and Nancy  --  or to spend an hour or two ruminating on the plight of the other woman . I considered this as I scoured the pots , but could n't really accept it . Mary Alice had been unnaturally cogent , had n't digressed even once . Not a whimper , not a sniffle during the entire conversation . " Bob , " I said later that evening , " I think Mary Alice was having an affair with Dr. Fleckstein . " " That 's ridiculous . " He was lying on his side in bed pummeling his pillow into a perfect mound . " Why is it ridiculous ? " " She 's sexless . You can see the bones on her chest . " " Well , she may not be your type , but she wants to talk to me tomorrow about Fleckstein . " " Judith , " he said patiently , " why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " " I know . But I 'm dying to hear how she got involved with Fleckstein . " " Why ? Who cares ? " " Are n't you curious about other people ? " I demanded . " Do n't you want to know what 's going on behind the facade ? " " Maybe , " he said , and yawned . " I mean , if they 're intrinsically interesting . But not Mary Alice or this Fleckstein character . " I sat on the bed in a silky red nightgown , decorously draped in front and cut to a low " V " in the back . Bob seemed to he studying  | the stitching on the quilt . " Look , " I said , " does n't it surprise you how varied people are ? I mean , everyone in Shorehaven seems to conform to the same blueprint . Okay , so there are variations in religion , higher education , number of kids . But when you meet anyone living in this community , you meet on common ground . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an office . I drive two car pools a week , someone else may drive three . There 's a sameness , right ? " So ? " he asked . " So , beneath the sameness , all sorts of things are going on . Affairs . Crime . " " Well , what do you expect ? People are individuals . " He was right , of course . What intrigued me was that the vast substratum of activity that everyone seemed to be enmeshed in seemed much more exciting than anything going on beneath my surface . I was what I seemed to be . " Why waste your time ? " he continued . " Stay home , relax , read the paper , read a book . Enjoy your leisure . " " Speaking of books , " I said , getting under the quilt , " you never opened your Valentine 's Day gift . " " I 'm sorry , " he said . I did n't reply . " Judith , come on . I said I was sorry . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll open it first thing tomorrow morning , okay ? " I nodded . " Where is it ? " he asked . " On the shelf in the hall . " " Good . Let me thank you in advance . " He leaned over , kissed my cheek , turned out his light , and went to sleep .  | IT 'S PAINFUL ENOUGH that I have to listen to that subanthropoidal horse 's ass whenever she manages to stick her skinny foot in my door before I can slam it shut . " Nancy 's perfectly shaped mouth , shimmering slightly with lip gloss , closed in a pout . Concentrating on the road , she drove expertly through the back streets of Shorehaven toward Mary Alice 's , neatly guiding her gray Jaguar around tight turns with a light hand on the wheel . " Really , Judith , why do you insist on subjecting me to that fool 's inane babbling ? " " She specifically asked to see you . " " The only reason she asked to see me is that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Look , just put it down as a personal favor to me , " I said . " Oh , I will indeed . " She raised her finely plucked eyebrows and glanced at me for a moment . " You know I 'm missing a morning 's work for this circus . " " Well , you could have said no , Nancy . " She seemed only mildly annoyed ; her face , with its even , classical features , relaxed . She brushed a long strand of auburn hair behind her ear , then sighed . " Are you working on anything now ? " I asked . " Nothing special , " she admitted . " But I damn well could have come up with ideas for at least ten marvelous articles this morning instead of listening to that white trash moaning and groaning . " " Actually , she was pretty much to the point when she called . Maybe it wo n't be that bad . " " Fat chance , " Nancy grumbled . We spent the next few minutes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nancy pulled the tar into Mary Alice 's driveway , slammed on the brakes , and  | switched off the ignition , all while resuming her pout . The house was a three-story monstrosity of stucco , red tile , and wrought iron , which might have made sense in California , but was simply silly in New York . " Is n't this just lovely ? " Nancy demanded . " Casa Mahoney . " Mary Alice 's husband , Keith , was reputed to be " big in construction . " He and Mary Alice had spared nothing in building their dream house . We stood in front of a massive carved wood door and rang the bell . " So understated . " Nancy whispered , looking at the large brass doorknob . The housekeeper , a tall , heavy West Indian woman , let us in and told us that Mrs. Mahoney would meet us in the sun room . " Just charming , " cooed Nancy . " Sala del sol . So adorably Andalusian . She even has a Moor . " " Shh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiled floor of the living room . " Just behave yourself for the next half hour . " Mary Alice stood on the threshold of the sun room to greet us . " Hello , hello , " she said , pecking each of us on the cheek . " I ca n't thank you both enough for coming today . Truly , you are sisters in every sense of the word . " She was dressed in a pale yellow wool jumpsuit with the zipper opened to mid-torso . Although she had the body of a malnourished ten-year-old boy , Mary Alice often dressed as if she were so magnificently endowed with breasts and hips that she had to share her bounty with the world . We declined her offer of rose hip tea , sat down on her elaborate wicker chairs , and watched as she tiptoed to the door to close it , first peering out to make sure her housekeeper was n't lurking about , steno pad in hand , to report to Keith . " All right , " she said , rubbing her tiny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easy , ladies . " " Try , " suggested Nancy in her deep voice . " Yes , yes . But where shall I begin ? There 's so much to say . " " I 'd begin at the beginning , " I said firmly . " It 's the best place , is n't it ? " " Good choice , " murmured Nancy . Mary Alice took a flowered cushion from one of the chairs and placed it on the floor , equidistant between Nancy and me . " Well , " she said , sitting down Indian fashion , " I first met Bruce , Dr. Fleckstein , at a party at the Wagners ' house . You know him , Nancy , Rick Wagner , he belongs to your club . He 's in real estate . " " I 'm so pleased for him , " Nancy said . " Anyway , " continued Mary Alice , " I knew instantly that there  | was something between us , something very strong and very powerful . He was standing in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some reason he happened to glance in my direction and our eyes met . I was wearing my black Halston . Did you ever have that ? That electricity with a man where you 're the only two people in the world , even though you 're in a crowd ? Anyhow , it took him about a half hour to get himself away from the two of them , and he came over to where I was standing and said hi . So I said hi back and we introduced ourselves . He said I 'm Bruce Fleckstein ' and I said ... " " It 's a quarter to ten , Mary Alice , and I have to leave at ten thirty , even if you 're in the middle of your first soul kiss , " said Nancy . " All right . But I want to give you a feeling of exactly what the relationship was like , so you can comprehend everything . " " Tell us , " I suggested . " Nancy , " I added , " please relax . " She complied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nostrils at me . Mary Alice cleared her throat . " Thank you , Judith . Well , to make a long story short , he called me on Monday . The party had been on Saturday night . Anyway , he said he 'd really enjoyed talking with me , that I had a lot of personality and substance , and asked if I could meet him for lunch . Well , I was n't sure at that point whether or not to go , but I said to myself , well , it 's just lunch and I do n't have to commit myself to anything if I do n't want to . So I met him at one o'clock at Wong Foo 's . " " Right next door to the Tudor Rose Motor Inn , " interrupted Nancy , a cold , stiff smile on her face . " Yes . But it never occurred to me that anything would happen that day . Anyhow , he looked so handsome . Very tight jeans with a Gucci belt and a yellow body shirt . And that dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It happens . You know , I once was second runner-up in the Susie Semite Pageant for dark-skinned beauties . " " Really ? Are you teasing me , Judith ? " " Yes . Go on , Mary Alice . " " All right . Where was I ? I ca n't believe he 's dead . Anyway , we just talked for a while , and then after we finished our soup , he looked me right in the eye and said , You turn me on . ' So I said Oh , come on , ' and he said that no , really , it was true and he put his hand on my thigh . He said I was adorable . " Well , one thing led to another , and I felt very attracted to him . So before we 'd even had dessert , he said , Let 's go , ' and put  | twelve dollars down on the table . 1 le did n't even watt tor the waiter to bring hint change . We just walked out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asked Nancy . " Yes . " " And then what happened ? " I inquired . " Nothing . We did it . That 's all . " " Just that one time ? " I demanded . " No . We met every Tuesday . " Nancy gazed at her . " At Wong Foo 's ? " " No . At the motel . Bruce said if we skipped lunch we 'd have more time together . " It made sense to me . If I were having an affair , I 'd rather be rolling about on a rough motel sheet , sweaty body to sweaty body , than lunching in a second-rate Chinese restaurant . But it did n't make sense for Mary Alice . She never struck me as a highly sexed person , one who could feel her underpants getting damp over Moo Shoo pork . She was generally vague about her sex life , although she had confided in me that she wished her husband 's " thing " were bigger ; but I never thought she 'd go out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so wrapped up in herself that it was difficult to imagine her focusing on someone long enough to become interested , much less aroused . Most of all , I could n't understand why she had never alluded to the affair before . " How come you never mentioned this before , Mary Alice ? " Nancy asked . " I was going to , but then I could n't . I just could n't . " My turn . " Why not ? " " I do n't know . I 'm not sure . It was a very complex relationship , and I guess I felt I could n't really give an outsider the realities of it . " Nancy crossed her long legs and glanced at her watch . I looked at mine . It was after ten and I knew I did n't have time to listen to Mary Alice meandering down her usual path of self-actualization through interpersonal give-and-take meaningful relationships . " Why are you telling us now ? " I asked . " I do n't know , " she answered , somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polish on her left hand . " Come on , Mary Alice .

"  | " He took some pictures , " she mumbled to the tiled floor . " Holy shit ! " Nancy exclaimed . " What kind of pictures ? " An unnecessary question , I suppose , but Mary Alice seemed to want to cut off the entire conversation . " Pictures of me , " she said , and began to cry . " Naked ? " I asked . She nodded and took a tissue out of her sleeve . She had obviously been anticipating a scene . " Yes , naked . " She wiped her eyes and dropped the tissue into an ashtray . Then , without thinking , she drew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pearly trail of pale green mucous spread from her upper lip to her cheek . " Naked , " she sniffled . " And more . " " More ? " breathed Nancy . " More what ? " She whispered something I could n't hear . " What ? " I asked . " Bound . " " Bound ? " I forced myself to look at her , knowing that if I did , I probably would n't giggle . " You mean , like S and M ? " " We had just been doing it regular . You know . But then he said that since our relationship was based on mutual trust , we should feel free to act out our fantasies . So a couple of times he brought rope and tied me up and did things . " " Like what ? " asked Nancy . She did n't seem at all surprised , merely curious , like a mechanic examining the engine of a new foreign car . " I ca n't . I ca n't , " she sobbed , drawing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her throat . " Mary Alice , " I said softly , " did he hurt you ? " " Not too much , " she whispered , looking past me . " And he was always careful not to make any marks that Keith would see . " " What about the pictures ? " I asked . Her breathing became more normal , but she still could n't look at me . Nancy was sitting back comfortably in her chair . I leaned forward toward Mary Alice . " The pictures . Tell us about them . " " Oh , he said that these were sacred moments that showed our mutual trust and he wanted to preserve them . He got this new Polaroid camera for his birthday and he took a few photographs . He said he 'd burn them after he looked at them a few times . " " Why would he burn them if he wanted to preserve your sacred moments ? " Nancy demanded . She began crying again . " I do n't know , Nancy . Oh , Jesus God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What if someone finds them ? What if the police find them ? What if someone shows Keith ? " She was terribly frightened , like a tiny fieldmouse that had somehow found itself in the midst of the annual American Pest  | Control Convention . I felt sick for her . " Did you ever ask him what he did with them ? " " No . " " Okay . Calm down . We 'll think of something . " But what ? I wondered . A complete confession ? Suicide ? A quiet little arson job on Fleckstein 's office and home ? " I ca n't think of anything , " Nancy announced . We sat silently for a moment . I looked at Nancy , but she avoided my glance . She played with her long hair , rolling it into a chignon and then letting it fall back to her shoulders . Mary Alice did n't want me to look at her either . We usually , shape our confidences to fit our audience 's taste . This time , though , it could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alice had made it so painfully personal , not a tale to be smiled at from a distance , and Mary Alice because she had once again made herself vulnerable by letting the outside world peep into her fantasy life . " Mary Alice , " I said . They both turned and looked at me . " Are you positive he never said anything about the pictures ? " " No . Nothing . Not really . " " What do you mean , not really ' ? " Nancy barked . " I mean , I once asked him if he still had the pictures he took . " " And what did he say ? " Nancy demanded , her voice low and tough , like a small-town southern sheriff . " Nothing . Just what did I think he was doing with them , using them for blackmail , and that I should n't be so neurotic . " Again we were quiet , but this time more from impotence than discomfort . If the police found the pictures and showed them to anyone involved in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , word would flash through Shorehaven about Mary Alice 's hobby and , two , she would instantly be deemed a suspect . If the police could seriously consider Marilyn Tuccio , they would leap with joy at the prospect of Mary Alice . In either case , Keith would kill her and use her body as a cornerstone for his next shopping center . " I 'll tell you why I asked you both here today , " said Mary Alice in a voice that startled us . It had great force and clarity , with none of her usual simpering , ingratiating tones . " First , Judith , I know you have a friend who 's a criminal lawyer . Right ? " " Yes . Claymore Katz . He was Bob 's college roommate . " " Well , I 'd like you to ask him what I should do . I mean , just describe the situation . You do n't have to mention any names . " " Look , Mary Alice , I 'll be glad to try , but Claymore does n't  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you call him so you can give him all the details ? " " No , Judith , please . I do n't want to get involved . Please do it for me . Please . " In a moment , I thought , she 'd grab my hand and cover it with kisses and say " Pretty please . " So I nodded and said : " Sure . No problem . " She bestowed one last smile on me and turned to Nancy . " Now , Nancy , you 're a writer . You investigate things . Right ? " " Wrong , Mary Alice . I do articles on personalities , a little pop sociology . I can barely find my own Tampax without a road map . So do n't think I can investigate ... " " But you used to work for Time , " Mary Alice insisted . " Sure . But I was a researcher . I looked things up in books . I made phone calls . I smiled a lot . But an investigative reporter is something else and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing out . All you have to do is pretend you 're a reporter and call up the police and try to find out what they have . That 's all . " " Impossible , " Nancy said . She glanced at me , looking for support . I looked away , back at Mary Alice . " Absolutely impossible . " " What do you mean , impossible ' ? " Mary Alice demanded . " The police are n't going to give out that kind of information . Even if they were going to give something away , they 'd give it to some reporter they know . Lord , I do n't even have any credentials . What should I do , call and say , Hi , I 'm Nancy Miller and did you happen to find any pictures of a nude blonde in Dr. Fleckstein 's files ? They 'd probably be under M for Mahoney . And would you mind giving all the pictures to me because I think they 'd make a peachy bonfire ? ' " " Wait a second , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " So what ? " she challenged . " Well , could n't you call one of the magazines you work for and ask them if they 'd like a story on this case ? That way , you could get credentials . " " That 's a great idea , Judith , " Mary Alice enthused . " Is n't that a good idea , Nancy ? " Nancy glared at both of us and put her head down and peered at her lap . " Quiet . Let me think . All right now , " she breathed , " Newsday will have their own reporters on it . Maybe New York would take a piece on the ninnies who abandoned the city be , fuse they were afraid of crime but got it up the ass in the suburbs . Or maybe the Sunday Times Magazine would take a  | police procedural , but they 're the biggest skinflints in town . " Mary Alice smiled at her eagerly . " I 'll pay you the difference between whatever they pay and your usual fee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it 's not just another article . You 're doing a favor for a friend . " " Blow it out your twat , " she responded . " Oh , all right . I 'll try . But do n't expect anything . " We left a few minutes later , with Mary Alice still murmuring thank yous . She seemed relieved , although I could n't be sure why . What could a criminal lawyer do for her ? Tell her that in the future she should keep her fantasies to herself ? Hold her hand ? And what could Nancy dig up ? That M. Bruce did , indeed , have a swell photo album ? That Mary Alice was a suspect ? That she was just one of Fleckstein 's bevy of beauties ? Maybe she seemed relieved , I mused to Nancy in the car , because someone else was helping to shoulder the burden . " Maybe , " she responded , " but it 's so pathetic . I mean , she 's built up this whole fantasy that you and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save her virtue . " Nancy braked the car at a stop sign and looked at me . " How could she be such a fool ? Did you hear that line of crap he gave her ? About her having substance . And she believed it ! My Lord , that broad is proof positive of the decline of the West . " " Do you think , " I asked slowly , " that she believed him because he zeroed right in on what she wanted to hear ? I mean , deep down she really thinks she 's a fascinating , adorable human being . " " All I know is if some guy who barely knew me called me up and told me how much substance I had , I 'd hang up the phone before he could finish the sentence . " " But you have substance , " I said to her . " I know that . But how could a guy  --  who 's spent a grand total of fifteen minutes with me , fourteen of them staring at my crotch  --  how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know , " I replied , trying to adjust the seat belt so it would n't cut off my circulation . " Do you think maybe he did get rid of the pictures ? " " Do you think so ? " " No , " I conceded , and paused . " You know what really gets me ? " " The seething lust ? " " No . Seriously . The fact that she wanted you for your talents . The only reason she wanted me was because I know a good criminal lawyer . "  | " Touchy , touchy . " " No , I 'm being honest . " " Judith , if she did n't have faith in your diplomatic ability , would she have confided in you ? Listen , I know plants with higher IQs than Mary Alice 's , so why do you care about her opinion anyway ? Let 's get this thing over . We have better things to do . " " Like what ? " I demanded . We drove back to my house for lunch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who arrived from nursery school famished . Tuna and tomato on rye for me . A slice of Swiss cheese and a bottle of Chablis for Nancy . Ever since we met , Nancy has been a very selective wino . While everyone else at school was guzzling Purple Passions , a cloying concoction of grape juice and domestic vodka , Nancy would pour glass after glass from her own bottle of wine . Always French , always dry . She would never share it . And throughout the years , I had never , seen it affect her . Her personality was consistently caustic , her intellect sharp , her figure slim , tight , and perfect  --  even though she drank at least a bottle a day . But I never felt comfortable about her drinking . I worried about her liver , about her need to anesthetize herself , about the effect it would have on her children when she became pregnant . And yet nothing seemed to happen . She wrote her articles , had healthy babies , played a superior game of chess , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a high school education or less . Her three children found her delightful . Her husband , Larry , an architect , adored her and smilingly assumed their faithfulness was mutual . I built a fire in the living room and we sat on the floor , going over our meeting with Mary Alice . Because I seemed so interested , Nancy patiently helped me review nearly every word . " Well , " she said at last , " that 's it . What did it say in the paper ? " " My God ! The paper ! " Without putting on my coat , I raced out to the driveway and picked up the Newsday , slightly sodden from the damp air . And there it was , front page . " Slain Dentist Linked to Pornography Ring . " And two pictures . One , a body , covered with a white sheet , being lifted into an ambulance by two men who looked slightly annoyed , as though their coffee break had been interrupted . And the other , a smiling head shot , Bruce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown hair styled into a perfect helmet around his fine head . " Anything new ? " asked Nancy when I ran back into the room . " Look ! "  | " I 'll read it when you 're finished . " " I 'll read it out loud . " I cleared my throat . " Dr. M. Bruce Fleckstein , a periodontist ( gum specialist ) who was found slain in his plush Shorehaven office two days ago , was about to be indicted for federal income tax evasion . According to law enforcement sources , Dr. Fleckstein was involved in a pornographic film distributorship that had long been the object of federal investigators ' scrutiny . " Dr. Fleckstein was reputed to be the silent partner in an operation that had been grossing over a quarter of a million dollars a month , much of it in cash . His alleged partners included Ira Spiegel of Great Neck , an accountant , and Carmine ( " Cookie Browneyes " ) Lombardi , a reputed member of the organized crime family of Peter Gambollo . Mr. Lombardi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an eighteen-month sentence for extortion . " According to Newsday 's sources , Dr. Fleckstein had not been cooperating with the investigation , and thus his death is not believed to be a typical Mafia hit . However , since the murder does not seem to be the result of random violence or robbery ( Fleckstein 's wallet , containing over three hundred dollars , was discovered on his body ) , investigators are pursuing the theory that the slaying was somehow linked with the pending indictment . " According to Lt. Nelson Sharpe , the officer in charge of the case , an autopsy will be performed on Dr. Fleckstein to determine the precise cause of death . A small wound was found in the base of the skull . " The Long Island Dental Society has offered a reward of $5,000 for information leading to the arrest of the murderer . Dr. Fleckstein 's family has offered an additional $5,000 . " Dr. Fleckstein 's widow , the former Norma Dunck , refused to answer reporters ' questions about ... " " That 's right . I forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked sharply . " Fleckstein 's wife is Dicky Dunck 's sister . " " Who in God 's name is Dicky Dunck ? " " You 've seen him . He belongs to Larry 's club . They took in a token Jew and a token black , remember ? Well , he 's the token Jew . He 's completely bald and wears a goatee . " " Him ? " Dicky Dunck was n't easy to miss , especially at Larry 's club , where all the men looked like they were competing in the National Blondness Sweepstakes . Dunck was an ordinary looking man who had shaved what remained of his hair and grown a  | wispy brown goatee ; he looked shy rather than sophisticated . " He 's awful , " said Nancy . " An unmitigated creep . But everybody tries to be nice to him to prove how liberal they are . Lord , they make me want to puke , the whole damned lot of them . " " But what about Dicky Dunck , " I persisted . " Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , they were on the outs . Something about Dicky 's father 's will . " " What about it ? " " Nothing fascinating , so do n't get your hopes up . I think his father left the bulk of his estate to Norma  --  Fleckstein 's wife ? and Dicky was contesting the will . Just a normal , ugly family fight over money . Nothing unusual . " " Was Dunck really angry ? " I asked . " Not that angry . Cool it , Judith . He just went around the club saying what a prick Brucie was and that he was proud to be a member of Shelter Cove and that he 'd never belong to a flashy club like Green Trees , where people like Brucie hung out . " " And that 's it ? " " That 's all , folks . " " All right , " I said , stretching out my legs and picking up the newspaper again . " Let me finish . Norma refused to answer the reporters ' questions . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seclusion . " The funeral is scheduled for tomorrow at the Baum Brothers ' Funeral Home in Great Neck . Interment will follow at the Shalom Cemetery in Flushing , Queens . " Police have requested that anyone with information about the crime call a special number : ( 516 ) 689-2104 . All replies will be treated confidentially . " " Oh , " breathed Nancy , " the possibilities simply boggle the mind . Let 's call and tell them all about Mary Alice . " " Are you crazy ? You 've got to be kidding . " " Of course , I 'm kidding . Lord , Judith , do n't take this so seriously . Nothing 's going to happen to Mary Alice . She 's a born survivor ; nothing really touches her . " " Bruce Fleckstein did , " I commented . " Come on , we 've been through that . All he did was confirm her own high opinion of herself . " I ran my hand through my hair , thick and short and slightly kinky from the humidity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | " Go ahead . " " For instance , when you 're having an affair with someone , do you suspend your normal intellectual processes and allow yourself ' to believe a line of blatant bullshit ? " " No . But I never trust a guy , even if all he says is hello . Listen , it 's really an unfair question . I ca n't compare myself to Mary Alice . She has no normal intellectual processes . " She stood and looked down at me . " I 'm going . I have to make a few phone calls and see if anyone wants an article on this drivel . " " Okay . I 'll call you tomorrow . Are you all right to drive home ? " If I had consumed that quantity of wine , I would n't be able to find the ignition . " Judith , stop busting my chops . " A few minutes after Nancy pulled her Jaguar out of the driveway , a large beige station wagon pulled in . It was Prescott Hughes , call-me-Scotty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hi , there . Is North ready ? " she asked . The child was Northrop Collier Hughes , and in forty years , with the combined clout of his three names , he would be director of the CIA or president of Yale . This did n't disturb me very greatly ; North was a bright , self-assured four-year-old and would no doubt carry on admirably . " Hi , Scotty . " I walked to the foot of the stairs and called softly , " North , your mother is here . " Normally , I would have bellowed out the child 's name , in tones worthy of my Lower East Side great-grandparents , but somehow Scotty 's calm , slightly nasal , upper-class voice had a tranquilizing effect . North came careening down the stairs . I watched with respect as he put on his own coat and buttoned it with no help from his mother . She did n't even praise him ; he was merely fulfilling a minor expectation . " Nasty business , this murder , " said Scotty , her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momentarily covering her large rectangular teeth , were drawn tightly together . I felt faintly uncomfortable , as if I had a share in bringing this unpleasant notoriety to Shorehaven . " It 's terrible , " I agreed . " Shocking . " Scotty tightened the belt of her camel-hair coat . " Are you going to the funeral tomorrow ? " she asked . " Well , " I said , trying to appear thoughtful while I whizzed through a list of possible replies , " I really had n't thought about it . "  | " I feel I ought to go . I worked with his sister-in-law , Brenda Dunck , on the anti-sewer campaign . " Now I knew exactly whom to blame whenever my septic tank backed up into my laundry room sink . " Oh , yes , Brenda , " I reflected , still pondering the possibilities . " I hope this does n't sound naive , " she said , " but what do you do at a Jewish funeral ? " " Well , you do n't laugh . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judith . " " You 're welcome , " I grinned back at her . " Look , why do n't I go with you ? " " Would you , Judith ? I 'd really appreciate that . " She paused . " But I do n't want to put you out . " " No problem , " I assured her , trying to sound warm and gracious . " Anyway , I think I should pay my respects to the family . " " Well , thanks . " Her long , bony face softened a little . " Can I pick you up ? About a quarter to ten ? The funeral is at ten . " " Make it nine-thirty . Ten is when the service starts , and you generally say all your I 'm so sorrys ' before that . " " Yes , of course . And Judith ... " I looked at her . " You 're a brick . Thanks . " She turned up the collar of her coat and left , followed by destiny 's darling , North . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried to consider exactly why I have always been so intimidated by that class of WASP , the ones who always seem to dress in thick , rich tweeds no matter what the season and never perspire . It 's not a matter of pedigree . Nancy 's family probably became Anglicans the same day as Henry VIII and she 's a descendant of Oglethorpe , but she is real . Her periods are painful and she thinks Woody Allen is funny and she has a passion for Italian salami . But there 's something so unfailingly correct about people like Scotty , as though they 've been programmed to be eternally vigilant in order to avoid a social gaffe . Scotty 's shirts never rumple , her children say " thank you " without prompting . I 'm sure she never had wax in her ears . And when I 'm with her , I feel she expects something more of me . But I do n't know what . At least tomorrow , I thought gratefully , I 'll be on my own turf . At a wet-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , paring his or her fingernails with a pointed instrument . Well , maybe not . But better than facing two weeks ' accumulation of laundry .  | BAUM BROTHERS OCCUPIES A LARGE BUILDING , a white brick cube , with a blue canopy stretched out in front and space for three hundred cars in the rear . It could easily pass for a catering hall , except , as you enter , you are greeted by one of several goodlooking young men , doubtless young Baums or Baums-in-law , dressed in black suits , white shirts , and narrow , somber , striped ties . When they ask , " May I help you ? " they sound sad but somehow reassuring , as if they recognize their responsibility to mute their grief and carry on . " The Fleckstein funeral ? " " Second floor . The elevator will take you up . " I followed Scotty , observing that the short , almost mincing steps seemed incongruous for such a tall , long-legged woman ? as though as a girl she had been embarrassed by her height and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was perfectly dressed though : a simple gray dress with a white collar and cuffs . Everyone would know she was truly sorry but not one of the prime bereaved , not one of the family . My black sweater and plaid skirt seemed wrong , and I began to sweat under my arms . " It 's chilly in here , " she remarked , as we paused by the brass elevator door . " Or maybe it 's just that I do n't like funerals . " I nodded and swallowed hard . Although I was fully aware that no one would challenge me , that no one would point a finger and demand , " Why are you here ? Who do you know in the family ? " I felt terribly uncomfortable . And with Scotty around , I 'd have to keep a stiff upper lip ; I could not change my mind and bolt . When we got upstairs , we stepped into the room where the family waited . About half the faces , about a hundred people , looked faintly familiar to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supermarket , the bakery , the playground , PTA meet-  | ings . But I felt my eyes drawn to a beige leather couch . There was Norma Fleckstein , surrounded by men and women with sad expressions . I could n't gauge hers because she was wearing large sunglasses , although she seemed not to be crying . As I inched closer , I heard her say , " Thank you , " and , " I do n't think it 's hit me yet . " " That 's his wife , " I said softly to Scotty . " Do you want to say something to her ? " " No , " she responded abruptly , staring , it seemed to me , at Norma 's long , thin legs , which were covered in translucent black stockings . " I mean , " Scotty added , turning to me , " I 've never met her . I do n't think it would be appropriate . " " Okay , " I said , a little regretfully . I had thought to test my courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotty touched my arm and whispered , " There 's Brenda Dunck . " She lifted her head in the direction of another beige leather couch across the room , near a coat rack . So that was Brenda , Dicky Dunck 's wife . I knew her . At least I had seen her half a dozen times . She belonged to the health club where I swam occasionally , when I felt my body going from merely soft to mushy . She was fairly short , about five foot three , and slim but very buxom , with a beautiful head of black hair , which she wore in a tight chignon at the base of her neck . Her face was not at all pretty ; she had small , hazel eyes and a rather sallow complexion , but at least her small , sharply hooked nose and square chin gave it some character . Now , though , she looked wretched . Her eyes were bloodshot and there were red blotches on the sides of her face , darker than the rouge on her cheeks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , offering her right hand . " Scotty , how nice of you to come . Thank you so very much . " Brenda seemed to perk up a bit at our arrival . Maybe she liked Scotty . Maybe she felt comforted by her presence . Maybe she felt hysterics would be unacceptable and sobbing a wee bit overdone . " Brenda , you remember Judith Singer . " " Yes , of course . Thank you for coming . " Clearly , she had no idea who I was . But because I was attached to Scotty Hughes , I must be a person she should have remembered . I blinked . I swallowed . " Brenda , I 'm sorry . This must be a hideous shock to all of you . " I felt I sounded wonderfully sincere . " Oh , yes , " she said . " It 's been a horror . An absolute horror . And of course for Norma and the children . A nightmare . " I do n't know why , but her voice seemed to have a pretentious  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ribs and say , " Aw , come on , Brenda . Talk regular . " She turned to the man next to her , her husband , Dicky Dunck . " Dicky dear , you remember Scotty Hughes . And Judith Srrg . " " Yes . Yes . How are you ladies ? " His goatee was too long and untrimmed . He looked like a billy goat . " I 'm fine , thanks , " said Scotty . " Fine , " I echoed . " I hope the next time we meet it 's on a happier occasion , " said Dicky . " A great guy , taken in the prime of life . " We all nodded and Brenda started to cry . " It 's a loss , a loss to all of us , " she sobbed . Scotty drew a handkerchief out of her pocketbook and offered it to her . " Oh , I do n't want to ruin your handkerchief . " " That 's all right , " Scotty reassured her . " Who could have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody 's safe these days . He was like a brother to me . " We nodded , and Brenda sniffled delicately into Scotty 's handkerchief , rubbing the soft Irish linen between her fingers . A black-suited Baum emerged from a door a few feet away and announced : " Would everybody except for the immediate family kindly step into the chapel ? " The chapel was a high-ceilinged room , paneled in maple . The casket , unadorned and in a slightly darker wood , stood front and center . A small lamp , the Eternal Light , was suspended above it . When everybody was seated , still another Baum walked noiselessly to the side of the casket and asked : " Would you please rise ? " We rose and the family walked through a door at the front of the chapel . First Norma , in a clingy black wool wrap dress , relieved only by a long strand of large , luminescent pearls . Very simple and quiet , befitting a widow not yet merry . An older woman clung to her arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's generous nose and wide mouth with thin lips . She looked like the one who had been embalmed : one of those women well past middle age who , through dieting and plastic surgery , managed to look about forty from a distance , but who , as you get closer , have the dry , brittle look of a mummy . They were followed by a girl of about ten . According to the obituary , there were three young Flecksteins , two boys and a girl . This was obviously the eldest , Nicole Kimberly . A momentary break in the procession and then came the Duncks , Brenda listing against  | Dicky and Dicky peering intently into the chapel , as if taking a head count . And , finally , a short man in a long black robe and the wrap-around aviator glasses that were popular a few years ago . He motioned us to be seated . " Who do you think he is ? " Scotty whispered . " The rabbi . " " But he 's not wearing a hat . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Norma , Nicole , Mrs. Fleckstein , Brenda , Dicky , " began the rabbi , " family and friends . What can we say about Bruce Flecks-tein ? " Let me up on the pulpit and I 'll tell you , I thought . Scotty looked at me , then , strangely , blushed and looked away . " We can , of course , say what a tragedy it is , a fine man taken from us in the prime of his years . And we can mourn the loss to our community of a dedicated professional . But the loss of Bruce , or Marvin , as his beloved mother adoringly called him , is the loss of the hub of the Fleckstein family wheel , the center of their world . As Yeats so aptly put it , The center will not hold . ' " Obviously not , as Norma , with a great noise , took in a huge breath of air and started sobbing . " I 'm glad she 's finally letting it out , " the woman in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about forty-five and had exactly the same streaky colored hair as Norma . They must have met at the beauty parlor . " And what can we say to Bruce 's wife , to his three fine children , to his mother , his family , his friends ? " pondered the rabbi . You can say that whichever one of them gave him a Polaroid for his birthday made a big mistake . As he went on , I peered around the chapel . Everyone seemed to be concentrating intently , possibly because at this funeral of a contemporary , they might hear a preview of how their own eulogies would sound . They all seemed serious , but not suspiciously so . Could any of these ordinary , predictable people have ended Fleckstein 's career as the Don Juan of dentists ? The rabbi banged his fist down on the pulpit , as if remonstrating me for losing interest in his sermon . " We may be deluged with rumors , besieged by innuendo , " he continued , " nearly strangled by the half truths and smears the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man Bruce Fleckstein was . We know ... " I sensed , more than felt , a shudder and glanced at Scotty . Her eyes were filled with tears and she opened them wide so the tears would n't run down her cheeks .  | " Scotty , " I said softly , " are you okay ? " She nodded , staring at the rabbi . " Scotty ? " " I 'm fine , " she snapped . At first I was bewildered . The combination of Scotty Hughes crying and irritable was barely believable . She was such a controlled person that normally the most emotion she could show was a big round of applause at a tennis match . Then I knew . " Scotty , " I murmured , " were you having an affair with Bruce Fleckstein ? " She whipped her head around to stare at me and then turned away . I knew I had committed a gross breach of etiquette , but I persisted . " Scotty , this is important , " I whispered . " Did he take any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body turned toward me . " You ? " she whispered . " No . A friend of mine . " I watched as she rummaged through her pocketbook , obviously looking for the handkerchief she had given to Brenda . I reached into mine and handed her a clean but linty tissue . She pressed it against her eyes . " Scotty , " I began again . " I think enough has been said , Judith , " and she turned from me , offering me a bit more of her back than was polite . There was no way I could pressure Scotty , as I had Mary Alice , to give me information . Mary Alice was so easily manipulated , and Scotty was a bright , self-possessed woman . But Bruce had gotten to her too . .. that Bruce Fleckstein was a man , a fine man with a fine family , and the memory of his warmth , his humor , his thousand little kindnesses will be our record of his life , our inheritance . " I tuned out the rabbi again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw my dentist , Dr. Burns . He was a soothing sort , small and quiet , who had Chopin piped into his office . A few rows in front of him sat a friend of mine , Fay Jacobs . I was startled . How could she know the Flecksteins ? Fay and I had met three years before at a NOW conference , where I had led a seminar on women in the New Deal . We began chatting and discovered we lived no more than a mile apart . Fay was in her fifties , short , stocky , and as muscular as a longshoreman , with chopped-off gray hair . She wore no makeup except for bright red lipstick , which invariably became smudged , giving her mouth a kind of pleasing , undefined generousness . She had been teaching history at Shorehaven High School since the late nineteen forties and was totally dedicated to her subject and her students . I adored her . " As Wordsworth so aptly put it . . . " the rabbi was saying .  | Certain that the quotation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Scotty . Her large , bony hands gripped the arms of her seat , and her eyes were locked on the Eternal Light in a redrimmed , unblinking stare . Had she come to Baum Brothers for a short goodbye , for a last moment with a lover who had brought passion and spontaneity into her placid , correct life ? Or was she simply making sure the corrupt , manipulative son of a bitch was dead ? " The Lord is my shepherd , ' " I heard dimly . How many women had followed him to the Tudor Rose Motor Inn , bleating with excitement ? Would I have ? If Marvin Bruce had told me how substantive I was , how thrillingly intelligent , would I have allowed myself to be led to an afternoon 's frolic ? The mourner 's Kaddish , the benediction , and then a brief announcement : " The family will be sitting shiva at the home of Mrs. Norma Fleckstein . The address is number fourteen , Fieldston Road , Shorehaven North . " The " North " added about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every home there had , minimally , a " water vw , central AC , and over 2 acs of beaut. wooded property . " The frosted-haired woman in front of me turned to her husband : " The home of Mrs. Norma Fleckstein . I ca n't believe it . " " Ca n't believe what ? " he asked . He was about fifty , with adolescent-length gray hair , dressed in a tan corduroy sport jacket with suede elbow patches . They clashed . She was with it , a Bloomingdale 's lady in a gray cashmere dress and heavy bracelets . He should have complemented her with a snug body shirt and Cardin suit , but instead , as if to emphasize the gulf between them  --  or to hide his paunch  --  he had opted for the sincere , professional look . He probably misquoted Buber to his nineteen-year-old girlfriends . " I mean , I ca n't believe that just a few days ago it was Bruce and Norma 's house and now it 's the home of Mrs. Norma Fleckstein . That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wings and asked us to rise again . We did , and the family began to trudge out . I turned to ask Scotty if she was ready to go . But she had already left . I could see her weaving through the crowd , heading along the side of the chapel to the rear exit . People poured into the aisles , a few looking dazed , a few waving eagerly to friends and neighbors across the chapel . A swelling wave of voices rose after the funereal silence . " How 've you been ? " " God , I hate funerals . " " How was Martinique ? " I pushed my way past them and over to Fay Jacobs.  | " Judith . How are you ? " she asked , beaming at me and adjusting her bra strap . She explained my presence to the woman standing next to her : " Judith is my favorite historian since Commager . " The woman looked a little confused and then decided Fay had told a joke . She laughed and then quickly excused herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's been months . " " I know . Why do n't we have lunch ? Come on , Judith , do n't refuse me . I took a personal day and I have all afternoon . " I thought for a second . " Sure . But I have to pick Joey up at a friend 's house at two-thirty . " " No problem , " she said . " I feel like pampering myself today . Let 's go some place very quiet and luxurious . " " How about Quelle Crepe ? They have a decent salade nicoise . " She put on a too-long red plaid coat and buttoned it slowly . Her knuckles were swollen with arthritis and even that simple task was painful for her . We walked outside , blinking from the bright sunlight , and stood under the canopy , watching the hearse and its escort of limousines and cars . " I did n't know you knew them , " Fay declared . " They were n't friends of yours , were they ? " " No . Not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know , Fay . I just shaved my legs and I wanted to wear a skirt and show them off . " " Judith , " she smiled , " come on . Why ? " " I really do n't know , Fay . The mother of one of Joey 's friends said she was going and I volunteered to keep her company . Just a whim . Curiosity . I do n't know . " We walked to the parking lot , Fay waving to every other person . She had lived in Shorehaven for so long that she seemed to know everyone . She patronized their stores , taught their children , worked with them at countless fairs and rummage sales . " How did you know the Flecksteins ? " I asked . " Would n't you rather discuss the revisionist view of Ken-nedy ? " " No . " She opened her pocketbook and extracted her car keys . " He went to dental school with my nephew Roger . I suggested to Roger that he practice here , but his little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he told Bruce about Shotrhaven , and when Norma and Bruce first moved here , I had them over to  | dinner a couple of times . Mainly to introduce them to some couples of their age . " " That was very thoughtful of you , " I commented . She smiled and shrugged her shoulders . " Fay , what was he like ? Really like ? " " Well , you would n't be able to comprehend him . You lead a decent , uncomplicated life . " She opened the door to her car with some difficulty , unable to get a tight grip on the handle . " For God 's sake , Fay . What 's this decent business ? What are you going to do , explain the situation to me when I grow up ? " She looked up at me , coloring a bit . " I 'm sorry . I really did n't mean to sound condescending . Look , let 's get to the restaurant and I 'll tell you everything I know about the Flecksteins . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would I be here if I were n't interested ? " " All right , " she sighed . " But it 's not a pleasant story . And you 'll see why Bruce did n't live happily ever after . "  | How MANY , s'il vous plait ? " asked the hostess , a heavy middleaged woman dressed in a beribboned French provincial costume . " Deux , " I replied , and followed her across the dark red linoleum floor , embossed in a brick design , to a small table in a corner . " Ees zees hokay ? " she inquired . She had the inept French accent of Americans who have never studied the language . " Oui , " I answered , and she smiled warmly at us and departed , no doubt pleased because she had carried on a conversation in French . Quelle Crepe had opened in the early sixties , when masses of young couples , thousands of little Jacks and Jackies , moved to Long Island from Brooklyn and Queens . Refusing to adopt the suburban Eisenhoweresque style of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the barbecue  --  they served coq au vin to each other and spent Saturday nights in Manhattan at the theater or the opera . Their sons , it is true , joined the Little League , but physical fitness did have the Kennedy imprimatur . And the ladies  --  they were n't women then  --  marched right by the tea rooms of the Old Wave suburbanites and into Quelle Crepe , where for a few dollars you could have a glass of wine and a crepe with fromage or fromage et oeufs or fromage et oeufs et jambon or even fromage et oeufs et jambon et asperges , like a francophile 's Dagwood sandwich . We declined the proffered menus and ordered our salads , t coffee . Fay ran her arthritic fingers through het massacred hairdo and smiled . " So ? " I asked . " So ? You want to know about the Flecksteins ? "  | " Everything . " " Well , Judith , everything ' is a little beyond me . I made certain never to cross over the barrier of intimacy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put them on the side of her plate . " Well , the most interesting thing was that there was nothing interesting about either of them . " She paused . " What do you mean ? " I inquired . " Well , they were n't uninteresting , in the sense of being stupid or dull . Bruce was quite pleasant really . The first time they came over , he chatted with everybody and even managed to sound interested in Lou Sherman  --  he 's on the board of the North Shore Historical Society . Well , Bruce asked him a lot of questions about the history of Shorehaven , and Lou was quite voluble . But I do n't know why , it was n't anything Bruce actually said , but I knew he really was n't interested in what Lou was saying . " " You mean he was just trying to make a good impression ? " " No . More than that . It was as if he felt that a little bit of local history might someday be useful to him . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he filed it somewhere in the back of his mind . I do n't know , there was something about him ... " " What ? " " Wait a second . " She speared a piece of lettuce and tuna fish . " It was as if he were programmed for niceness . He was pleasant to everyone , interested in everyone , to the same degree . " " Who else was there that evening ? " " It was so long ago . Let me think . The Shermans , the Burnses . " " The dentist ? " I asked . " Yes . And Joe and me . I think that was all . " Joe , Fay 's husband , a vice-president of a local bank , was such a quiet , pallid man that I often had to be reminded that he existed . " All right , " I said , " what about Norma ? What 's she like ? " " Nice . " " Nice ? From what you said at the funeral home , I was expecting a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . She had the same sort of pleasantness he had , a kind of controlled friendliness to everyone . I remember thinking she was very attractive for a basically ordinary-looking woman . Very well groomed and beautifully dressed , and they did n't have much money then . But there 's nothing more to tell about her . She asked all the right questions  --  about the schools , which temple to join , things like that . And she did all the right things . " " You mean she did n't pick her nose at the dinner table . "  | " No , " Fay grinned . " Only over hors d'oeuvres . But you know what I mean . She brought me a nice little house gift . She talked with everyone . She sent me a thank you note . " " Do you think , " I asked , holding a wrinkled black olive between my thumb and forefinger , " that she seemed a little bland because she was nervous or shy ? Being new in the community ? " " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fay conceded . " But it was odd . Nothing else came through . Usually , like the first few days of school , when kids are on their best behavior , you can pick up a lot about them . Their quirks just seem to pop to the surface . I can always tell the intelligent ones and the ones who have personal problems and the ones who will spend the whole term just taking up space . But with Norma , well , she was what she was . " And what was she ? " " Nice . Attractive . Polite . Reasonably intelligent . " " How did she relate to her husband ? " She adored him . That was obvious . Every time he spoke , she would concentrate on every pearl that dropped from his lips . I mean , if he had announced he was going to the bathroom , she would have thought that was terribly clever and very profound . " " And how did he act toward her ? " " He seemed devoted to her , did all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , lit her cigarettes . " Our coffee came and by tacit mutual consent we took a break , although I was still unclear why Fay was so disturbed by the Flecksteins ; there had to be more . For a few minutes , we chatted about her honors class , a seminar of high school seniors studying the Civil War . Then Fay asked : " Would you like more coffee ? " " Yes . And more about the Flecksteins . " She looked at me and shifted uncomfortably in her chair . " If they were so terribly ordinary , why did n't you like them ? What happened ? " " Well , it 's hard to say when it started . Oh , I know . About a week after the party , Jean Burns called me , ostensibly to say thanks . But she started asking all sorts of questions about Bruce , and about his relationship with Norma . " She stopped for a minute . " Judith , this is to go no further . " " It wo n't , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , by the time we finished talking , I was absolutely convinced that something was going on , or was about to go on , between jean and Bruce . " " Did you ask her ? " " No . I could n't . We 're not particularly close . " Remembering  | how I had behaved with Scotty , I realized that Fay obviously had a great deal more discretion than I. " Anyway , " she continued , " about a month later , we ran into the Burnses at a restaurant , and Dennis asked us if we had heard from Bruce . I said no , and he went on to tell us that he had referred a few patients to Bruce and that they all seemed very pleased . We were standing there , smiling and chatting , when I took a look at Jean ; she looked like she wanted to crawl under a table and die . Nothing specific , but she was obviously terribly uncomfortable . And I remember thinking , what a nasty thing for Bruce to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to be decent to him . And really , Judith , I was n't being unfair . I later heard rumors from two different sources that something was going on between Bruce and Jean . " " He sounds like a real sweetheart , " I commented . She took a deep breath . " That 's not all . " Fay told me that over the years she had heard buzzing about Fleckstein 's involvement with several women . Two or three of them were housewives , although she did n't mention their names . One was a successful real estate broker in town , another was  --  and she seemed surprised  --  an activist in the feminist movement . " He was bound to run into trouble sooner or later , " she added . " Is there any common denominator ? " I asked , thinking about Mary Alice and Scotty . " Is Jean Burns Jewish ? " " Yes , " Fay said . " But not all of them were . " I knew that , but that blew my first theory , Ethnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all upper-middle-class women , all married . " " The husbands ? " " All successful , come to think of it . Doctors , dentists , lawyers , stockbrokers , businessmen . " " Men too busy to pay attention to their wives ? " I theorized . " Let me think . No , I do n't think so . I mean , I can think of at least two cases where the husbands were really genuinely devoted to their wives . Dennis Burns , for instance . It was as if Bruce only wanted to associate himself with success . " " And what about Norma ? " I asked . " Do you think she knew ? " " Well , I do n't think so . You know , Judith , I 've seen several men with a pants problem , and I 'm convinced their motive is n't sex . Usually , if you 'll excuse me , they screw other women literally to screw their wives figuratively . But Bruce was different . He was always lovey-dovey with Norma , never flirted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her coffee cup . " You know , I do n't usually talk like this . About other people 's private affairs . But there was something so threatening about Bruce . "  | " In what way ? " I asked , my hushed tones matching hers . " I know this sounds melodramatic , but I got the feeling he was pure evil , like the snake in Eden . Very smooth and very corrupt . Corrupting , really . Nothing blatant , like Hitler . " " Churchill called him this wicked man Hitler . ' Remember ? " " Yes . But Bruce was more subtle , like Albert Speer . Wickedness was a choice , not a response . " " God , " I breathed . " Well , the opposite really ; nothing godlike about the incredible Dr. Fleckstein . You know , I 've always been fairly religious , a reasonably observant Jew , but for a long time I told myself that I just had to watch out for myself  --  and my family . That it was wrong to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the more I study history , the more I believe that one has to take a moral stand . And Bruce Fleckstein was a bad man . " " You 're certain the rumors were true , then ? " She smiled . " You 're a truly just person . Yes , the rumors were true . I know . Because he tried to seduce me . " Fortunately , I restrained my impulse to blurt out , " You ? " Any man getting to know Fay as a person would soon realize what a lovely human being she was , but she was not the type to light a fire in the loins of the average suburban Don Juan . " Tell me , " I said . Fay 's colorless , ordinary face looked drawn . Her lipstick had disappeared with her lunch , so her mouth blended into the rest of her features , defined only by a few deep lines in the corners . She was terribly uneasy , though I could n't tell if it was from her natural reticence or because her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , about a couple of months after they had been to our house , Norma called and invited us to dinner . We went , had a reasonably nice time , and that was that . At least I thought that was that . But the next Monday I had a call from Bruce about four o'clock , a few minutes after I came home from school . " She hesitated . " This is so embarrassing . " " If you 'd rather not , " I began . " No , it 's okay . Well , he began by saying how much he enjoyed my company , how much he admired me . I had a good mind , I remember he said . And then he said : I find you very attractive . ' " " What did you say ? " " I said thank you and how was his lovely wife Norma ? He just pretended he did n't hear and then asked me out for lunch . " She paused for a minute and then made a noise , a cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I told him I had forty-five  | minutes for lunch and thirty minutes of that time were spent grading papers . " " Did he take the hint ? " I asked . " Yes . He even managed to be very gallant . 1 le said something to the effect that it 's so rare to meet such an intelligent , sensitive woman and it 's too bad we could n't get together . " " Maybe he was being sincere , Fay . " " Judith , I know what I am . I 'm reasonably bright , competent , and interesting . And just between us , I would be overjoyed if a handsome young man came and kneeled down before me and offered himself as my liege man  --  especially if he did n't want to admire me from afar . But I 'm not pretty . I 'm not , according to current usage , sexy . I was a good ten years older than he , and I just knew he was saying to himself , Here 's a plain , dull , menopausal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " I shook my head . " You 're not being fair to yourself , Fay . " " Maybe not fair , but honest . " She toyed with a locket she was wearing and told me that at her husband 's insistence , they had seen the Flecksteins a few more times . Joe , in his role as a bank officer , felt that Fleckstein had the smell of success  --  and had hoped some of the aroma would waft his way . Finally , Fay told him that she found the Flecksteins very dull and refused to socialize with them again . Joe acquiesced . " So you never saw them again ? " " No , but Joe saw Bruce on business . That 's why I came to the funeral ; Joe had an appointment today and could n't break it . " " You never said anything to him about Fleckstein 's over-ture ? " " No . What good would it have done ? Anyway , Joe finally became disillusioned with Bruce . Bruce 's brother-in-law , Dicky Dunck , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . Joe says Dicky was good for the money , but had a cash-flow problem or some such thing , but it would n't have meant any risk to Bruce . But he would n't do it . In fact , he told Joe to call Dicky and tell him no . It was horribly awkward . " " What did Dicky need the loan for ? " I asked . " Oh , I think it was for some new equipment . Oh , wait , to meet his payroll . That 's what it was . And Joe said that even if there had been a risk , ten thousand would have been pin money to a man in Bruce 's position . The thing that got to Joe was the callousness . " Fay ran a gnarled hand over her mouth . " I guess I should n't be talking like this about Joe 's business . But it was so cruel , so upsetting . "  | We lingered over a second cup of coffee until the waitress came with the check . We both grabbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I invited you to lunch . " " Come on . Let me be a sport , " I argued back . " That way I can close my eyes and pretend I 'm grown up with an expense account . " We split the check and walked slowly to the door , each of us nodding to various neighbors and acquaintances . " It 's such a small town , " Fay remarked . She dropped me off at the house and I flopped down on the couch , grateful at the prospect of a half hour of silence . Off came my shoes , and I began playing with a thread on my pantyhose . Within seconds , I had a full-fledged run and a rush of adrenalin . You have deeds to do , obligations to meet , my body called out to me . Naturally , I obeyed . I stood and marched purposefully into the kitchen  --  then stood there , confused . Just what was I supposed to do ? Bruce ? Norma ? Fay ? Scotty ? Ah , Mary Alice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would call Claymore Katz . Surely Claymore would know what to do . He was , for an Ivy League-educated , upper-middle-class attorney , streetwise ; he once told me that a client of his had had an accident . What happened ? I asked . " His head got in the way of a bullet . " But if I called him , Bob would be annoyed . He would demand , coldly , just what was wrong with me . Why was I getting involved ? Still , I could tell him the extent of Mary Alice 's involvement , explain she needed a lawyer fast . And what would Bob say ? " Fuck her . Her husband can pay for a lawyer . Just stay out of this . " I stood looking at the telephone . Why not call ? Claymore was my friend too . He would swoop down on me at a dinner party and herd me into a corner . " Judith , my joy , my pleasure . Talk to me of life . Of history . If I hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to heave . God , what happened to them ? How did they become so incredibly boring ? How did we escape ? " Rather nervously , I looked up Claymore 's number and dialed . The switchboard operator greeted me with a cheerful , " Burton , Furn , Ziss and Katz . Good afternoon . " " Mr. Katz 's office , " his secretary said , sounding even more cheerful than the switchboard operator . Should I disguise my voice , give a false name ? Bob called Claymore frequently . What would the secretary think if Mrs. Singer called ? But could n't men and women be friends ? Could they be ? " Mr. Katz 's office , " she said again .  | " Mr. Katz , please . " " Whom shall I say is calling ? " " Mrs. Singer . " " Hello . " Claymore 's voice was smooth and clear and deep . I fearing it , you 'd imagine you were talking to God , or at least someone over six feet tall , instead of the short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom it belonged . " Hi , Clay . Judith Singer . " " Judith , " he said , his voice full of warmth . " Why did n't you just say Judith ? ' When I heard Mrs. Singer , ' I just assumed it would be some tedious functionary from the A.G. 's office . That 's the Attorney General 's office . How are you , you lovely , bright , human being ? " " Fine , Clay . Look , I have a major favor to ask you . " " Anything . Could Dante say no to Beatrice ? " " Clay , listen , there 's something I want to talk to you about . Could we have lunch one day next week ? " " Yes . Sure . Is it something important ? " " Kind of . What 's a good day for you ? " " Let me check my calendar . Monday I 'll be downtown all day . Is Tuesday okay ? I have a Bar Association committee meeting where everyone sits around clearing their throats to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd love to get out of that . About one o'clock ? I 'll meet you at my office and we 'll go someplace painfully elegant . " I thought about it . Claymore 's firm did all of Singer Associates ' legal work . " Tuesday 's fine , but could we meet in a restaurant ? I do n't want to run into my father-in-law or one of my brothers-in-law if they happen to be around your office . " Claymore paused for a minute . I could hear him swallow . " Sure . I assume you do n't want Bob to know about this either ? " " Right . I 'll explain at lunch . " " Fine . We can meet at Orsini 's then . At one . " " Lovely , Clay . " Maybe I 'd see Jackie Onassis . Or at least Lee Radziwill . " Look , I really appreciate this . " " I 'm looking forward to it , Judith . " I replaced the receiver gently and began worrying about what to wear . By electing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of touch with Manhattan fashions , as well as ideas . I knew my pleated skirt was wrong , but I did n't know what was right . In desperation , I called Nancy , who told me to wear a plain dress ; she 'd fix it up with a scarf and a few strategically placed gold chains . " Thanks , " I said . " By the way , guess where I was today . " She
