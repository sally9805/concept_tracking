txt EXCEPT FOR a few isolated interruptions , it was a typical Monday on the Chicago Transit Authority 's bus and rapid transit routes yesterday , despite the strike by 686 CTA shop and maintenance workers . The strikers , represented by the Metal Trades Council , walked out at 12:01 a. m. yesterday after voting last week to reject the CTA 's latest contract offer . Picket lines were set up at 11 CTA garages and at nine rapid transit terminals , but few bus drivers and rapid transit workers stayed off their jobs to support the walkout , CTA officials said . BUS AND train service moved well in the morning and evening rush hours . The only serious delay in the morn ' ing rush hour occurred at the Archer Avenue bus barn , Pershing Road and Archer Avenue , I when the lead bus driver in a line of some 40 buses refused to move thru the picket line . Fears expressed by CTA officials that Teamsters Union members who deliver daily supplies of fuel to the bus barns would honor the picket lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossing the picket lines for the most part , at least for the present , " a CTA spokesman said . Representatives of the Teamsters Joint Council were meeting yesterday to discuss what action to take regarding the picket lines . If they decide to honor the strike , they could bring bus service to a standstill by tomorrow or Thursday . A union spokesman , tho , said such action was unlikely because of legal problems and the possibility that such action would be interpreted as an illegal secondary boycott against oil companies . THE STRIKING workers , whose job is to keep CTA buses , trains , and other equipment in running condition , want a 5.5 per cent pay increase , according to George Tapling , Trades Council president . The workers , who include members of craft unions , have had no contract since December . The bus drivers and rapid transit workers , represented by Divisions 241 and 308 of the Amalgamated Transit Union , AFL-CIO , also are working without a contract . However , their dispute is before an arbitration board . A clause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike during arbitration . The Trades Council does not have an agreement with the CTA setting up arbitration if a settlement can not be reached . In the past , the council waited for the , outcome of the arbitration involving the operating unions before settling , on a new contract . " This time our people were fed up waiting and just could n't sit still any longer , " Tapling said . UNDER THEIR previous contract , the Trades Council workers earned a base pay of $6.051/2 an hour-15.5 per cent more than the base pay for bus drivers and motormen . Since the contract expired on Nov. 30 , the CTA has granted them four cost-of-living increases totaling 301/2-cents an hour . The CTA 's latest offer to the council assured its members the same wage increases , plus the 15.5 per cent differential , and the benefits that result from the arbitration under way between the CTA and the bus drivers and rapid transit workers . The next meeting of the arbitration committee is next Monday but Tapling said his people were n't willing to wait . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table now , " he said . " If it 's offered to us , we 'll take it and gamble . If arbitration between the CTA , and the operating unions results in more than 5.5 per cent , that 's our gamble . " WHILE CTA officials expressed confidence that a complete transit shutdown is unlikely now , the effect of a long-term strike could be more serious , they admitted . " We have the manpower and ability to make minor repairs on buses and rapid transit trains , but the need for major overhauling of equipment over a long period of time would hurt us , " the CTA spokesman said . No negotiations were scheduled yesterday between the strikers and - the CTA , and no one was predicting how long the strike may last . Involved in the walkout are the electricians , blacksmiths , mechanics , machinists , sheet me t al workers , carpenters , upholsterers , plumbers , pipe fitters , and printers .                   @ @
