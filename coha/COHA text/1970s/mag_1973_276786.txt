Stretching 500 miles southeastward from the delta of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers to a narrow strait that doglegs around the tiny tip of Oman , the Persian Gulf may be the world 's most valuable and vulnerable waterway . At such desert-edge ports as Ras Tanura , Abu Dhabi , Kuwait , Dhahran and Kharg Island , scores of supertankers congregate like wallowing whales to suck up crude oil . Daily they plow through the gulfs warm waters and out through the Strait of Hormuz carrying some 20 million bbl. of oil-almost half of the non-Communist world 's consumption . If the gulf were closed , the effect on the U.S. , Europe and Japan would be devastating . <P> It was no surprise , then , that President Nixon last week accorded an especially effusive Washington welcome to the man who has pledged that the waterway will remain open to all : Mohammed Reza Pahlavi , Aryamehr , Shahanshah of Iran , scion of 2,500 years of Persian power and self-appointed ( with U.S. encouragement ) policeman of the Persian Gulf . He had two private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the Shah , 53 , and his stunning third wife , Empress Farah , 34 , were feted by the President at a state dinner in the White House ( the 115 guests included a gusher of U.S. oil executives ) , and the Nixons attended a reciprocal dinner at the Iranian embassy . Perhaps most satisfying , though , was the morning the Shah was given with officials of the Defense Department . For more than anything else , he was in Washington to shop for weapons. * <P> Iran already has an awesome arsenal . Since 1965 it has spent more than $3 billion in the U.S. and Europe on mostly sophisticated arms , including 70 Phantom F-4 jet fighters , 400 tanks , a destroyer , a couple of frigates and what is probably the biggest fleet of Hovercraft ( 50 ) in the world . But the Shah , who makes the final decision on all such equipment , wants more . Currently prepared to spend $2 billion or so a year , he has on order 100 F-5E supersonic fighters , another 100 Phantoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four frigates . Last week he added to his shopping list the Grumman F14 , which is so expensive ( at $14.8 million ) that even the U.S. Navy has been forced to cut down on its original order . <P> Extending Influence . The Shah is also spending heavily on military installations . He plans to expand the five-year-old naval and air force base at Bandar Abbas , which overlooks the Strait of Hormuz at the mouth of the gulf . A new , even bigger base for the two services is planned for Chah Bahar , close to the Pakistan border on the Gulf of Oman , extending Iranian influence into the Indian Ocean . A complex to handle a helicopter force of 10,000 men is to be built at Isfahan , in the interior . In addition , a vast communications network and automated logistics system for the armed forces is under study . " It sounds as though your ambition is for Iran to become the strongest country in the area , " a U.S. newsman told the Shah in Washington . " It is not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is inevitable .
