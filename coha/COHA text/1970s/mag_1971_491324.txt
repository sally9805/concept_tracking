CHICAGO IS BURNING ! shouted the " extra " edition of the Evening Journal on October 9 , 1871 . Chicago is still burning , but not with the destructive flame which attacked it a hundred years ago . The energy to rebuild which began before the ashes had cooled ( by 1873 , burned-over land was already worth more than it had been when buildings stood on it ) has never really slowed down . Soon , when the Sears , Roebuck skyscraper is finished , it will be the tallest building in the world . Chicago always yearns toward the largest . Even in destroying itself in the Great Fire , it burned over 2,124 acres . By contrast , the dreadful fires of European history were small . In Moscow , four hundred acres were burned ; in London , five hundred acres . 1 t must also be remembered that in 1871 Chicago was a little place . Flying into Chicago from the south , you pass over the intense flames of the steel-plant hearths . In winter , wind off the lake can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin . In summer , the Midwest sun does not simply move from east to west . It burns its way across the sky . The most important blaze in human history took place in Chicago . Under the stands of an abandoned football field , on December 2 , 1941 , as the bronze plaque states , " man achieved here the first self-sustaining chain reaction and thereby initiated the controlled release of nuclear energy . " The fireball and the mushroom cloud over Hiroshima began when a group of scientists from many countries as well as the United States , under the leadership of the Italian Enrico Fermi , had developed the process ? similar to that which is the source of the sun 's energy ? of splitting the uranium atom . The result was the unbearable explosion of the bomb . Thus , it is not too much to say that the nuclear age exploded its beginning on the South Side of Chicago . ( Fermi , whose wife was Jewish , refused to return to Italy after receiving the Nobel Prize . The Italian press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fascist salute at the ceremony in Sweden . ) One of the century 's greatest monuments , in any country , is the sinister , powerful , immense sculpture by Henry Moore commemorating the birth of the nuclear age on the spot where it happened , across from the new Enrico Fermi Institute for Nuclear Studies on Ellis Avenue . ( It is typical of our times that a Chicago work of art was designed in England and cast in Germany , an international act comparable to the original scientific work of the " team " which made the original event . ) Moore describes his work in clear and imaginative terms : " The atom piece is meant to have in it the kind of mushroom shape of explosion . But also in my mind there was the skull implication of death , because although the atom fission is perhaps a great boon to mankind , it also has this opposite implication . Like anything that is powerful , it has a power for good and evil . But the lower part is more architectural and in my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with sort of a hopefulness for mankind , and the belief ? the religious side of life . " Moore once said that in all of his drawings and sculpture , at least 99 percent have been connected with the female figure . " I like the whole thing that women represent in the world . It 's more fundamental .... " This great bronze dome , on a bright day with the sunlight falling through its hollow interior , seems to burn , to glow with that feminine fertility which you feel rising on a hot midsummer night out of the immense Midwestern fields , of which Chicago is the center . To prove how fast Chicago has moved beyond its old purely materialistic stereotype , note that it is the only city in the world to have displayed , in public places , monumental work by two of the twentieth century 's greatest artists , Moore and Picasso . At the new Civic Center , with its huge open plaza , its fountains , flags and trees , giving a prairie openness to an enclosed city , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has energy in it . Any moment it could become a living creature and take off , probably into the loudness of the air . The other tall figure representing the city is almost impossible to see . It is the 32-foot-high Ceres , goddess of agriculture , on top of the Board of Trade Building ? again a feminine form , appropriate to the world 's largest grain-futures market . Ceres is a little tarnished with the snows , rains , winds , sun and dirt of the city , but her face is womanly , gentle-strong . The Moore piece gives off a sense of the fire in which it was cast , a color proper for the act it celebrates , while the Picasso sculpture is made of Cor-Ten steel that resists atmospheric corrosion and rust , while turning a rich russet brown . South of the Loop and well in from the glittering lake front , the black section of the city burns with the despair , rage , and bitterness of an entire people . Even in winter , you can feel that anger blister the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendliness of this city , when you are moved by the splendor of its museums and the brilliance of its parks along the lake , this knowledge of the unsolved black problem sneaks up and sandbags you over the head . But Ebony , the magazine of black progress and dignity , is published here , well-edited by Herbert Nipson . And Gwendolyn Brooks goes on , as for many years , writing her lyrical toughness about the black life she has lived in this fiery city . In the shadow part of Chicago , her writing , like her person , gives off a dark light . Chicago is possibly the most self-conscious city anywhere any time . Between 1830 and 1890 , its population multiplied nearly three thousand times . It has always been aware of the need for faith in itself . While the city still smoldered around him after the fire , W. D. Kerfoot , a real estate man , put up a wooden shanty for his office with a sign stating : " All gone except wife , children and energy. - While lamenting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a letter : " The men of Chicago are heroes ; their energy , cheerfulness and determination are something almost sublime . " A joke after the fire suggests the reputation the city had for its speed of growing . It was told in places as far apart as St. Louis and London that a citizen of a distant city rushed to the railroad station and demanded a ticket to Chicago at once , in fear that it would be rebuilt before he could view the ruins . For the fourth time in its brief history , the Tremont House was destroyed in the fire . Its manager saved only the money from its safe and a few pillowcases stuffed with silver . Fleeing , he found that the Michigan Avenue Hotel , although in the direct line of the fire , was not yet burning . The Tremont manager went in and offered the manager of the Michigan Avenue Hotel $1,000 for the lease and furniture and walked away with an agreement witnessed by harried guests who were dragging their belongings into the street . A letter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1971 as in 1871 : " If the stranger , having missed the sight of the most remarkable conflagration of modern times , would see a still greater wonder , let him visit Chicago ... and see the work which has been done , and that which is in progress . Let him revel for a few days in the spectacle of what a young Western community can do in a single season towards building a great city . " These attitudes toward Chicago are crucial to an understanding of the city 's tomorrow as well as of its present , for this combination of hopeful belief and honest brag has from the beginning been stronger here than anywhere else . The city was first built on the unlikely base of swampmarsh-sand , and was then rebuilt on a base of ashes ( during the fire , one of the dangers was from crazed animals running through the streets trying to escape the red rain of burning ash on their hides ) . Remember , this was the city which later reversed the flow of a river , making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Chicago philosophy was uttered after the success of the 1893 Columbian Exposition by one of the architects deeply involved in that assertion of the city 's maturing . Daniel Burnham said : " Beauty has always paid better than any other commodity and always will . We have been running away to Cairo , Athens , the Riviera , Paris and Vienna because life at home is not so pleasant as in those fashionablecenters .... No one has estimated the millions of money made here in Chicago and expended elsewhere .... " Then he stated the principle upon which Chicago still tries to base its future . " Make no little plans , " Bumharn urged . " They have no magic to stir men 's blood and probably themselves will not be realized . Make big plans ; aim high in hope and work , remembering that a noble , logical diagram once recorded will never die , but long after we are gone will be a living thing , asserting itself with growing in tensity . " Carl Sandburg put it into words : " Here 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Hell and never saw the place . We 're writing about Chicago after looking the town over . " In a city , as with a person , you always look for that style which individualizes . Sandburg said something about that too : Style ? go ahead talking about style . You can tell where a man got his style just as you can tell where Pavlowa got her legs/or Ty Cobb his batting eye . The Chicago style is delight through directness . As the great architect Louis Sullivan phrased it : " form follows function . " No mere decoration , only the solid thing . Beauty comes from the truth of an object , building or brick . When moralists protested Sally Rand 's fan dance at the " Century of Progress " exposition in 1933 , Judge Joseph B. David , refusing to stop the performance , commented that " some people would like to put pants on horses . " To prove the point , the Circle Campus ( replacing slums near the famous Jane Addams Hull House ) of the University of Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to the students ) wider at the top than at the bottom firm evidence that this really is Sandburg 's " City of the Big Shoulders . " Not long afterward , the John Hancock Center of 100 stories was built on Michigan Avenue , the first skyscraper tapering from a broad base to a narrow top . The day I went to the observation floor in the world 's fastest elevators , traveling I , 800 feet a minute , 1 could look down and see boys playing baseball in a vacant lot next door . Where else ? From that distance , the quality looked about as good as that of the Chicago Cubs . Here is the All-American city . More people can be reached more quickly and at less cost from Chicago than from any other city in the United States . That is why the largest mail-order finns are here . Only eight entire nations outside the U.S.A. exceed metropolitan Chicago 's Gross Annual Product ? $51 billion . That is why the world 's largest post office is here . That explains why more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by train , truck and air every day than from any other city . The business of this city is business and the form of the city follows that function . The world 's largest privately owned commercial structure is the Merchandise Mart , dedicated to selling , at wholesale , any manufactured object . It is the most symbolic building in Chicago , immense in floor space , massive in design ; from any distance or angle it cries out , " Here is the cathedral of things . " One million tons of freight are switched every day in Chicago 's railroads , and yet behind that statistic , as behind the Merchandise Mart , is the human expression of this material activity . People are paid at a level also astonishing . Average family income for Chicagoans in 1970 was $16,900 , a full 29 percent above the national average after taxes . Total per capita personal income in 1970 amounted to $5,120 . With only 3.7 percent of the nation 's population , metropolitan Chicago had 4.6 percent of the nation 's effective buying income and 5.25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest percentage of women employed and the highest percentage of workers employed , along with the lowest national percentage of unemployment . In brief , Chicago was busiest about its business . While Detroit is dominated by a single industry , 32.8 percent being in automobiles , and New York being 23.8 percent in apparel , Chicago relies on a broad expanse of industries , most of them nondefense related . The John Hancock Center has a story of glowing light around its top . The cold figures in the preceding paragraph also glow , for they mean that men and women are earning money while they make things and sell things , and that means a home . The greatest wealth-producing region on earth is the area surrounding Chicago , from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico , from the Rockies to the Appalachians . For this wide heartland , Chicago is the heart , a little to one side , maybe ; but then , is n't the human heart on one side ? Nor is Chicago merely provincial . It is the largest inland seaport in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north Atlantic , and the barge-way joining it to the Mississippi and the Gulf . It is the only great port not on a seacoast or a river , but on a lake . When goods move , people live . Chicago goods now move wherever there is ocean water to carry them . Chicago has always aspired high ; now it is aspiring wide , across the salty seas of the world . Like a certain car-rental agency , being second , it had to try harder . One result is the astonishing number of firsts in its relatively short history : the first steel-frame skyscraper , first stainless-steel building , first grain reaper , first nuclear reactor for providing commercial electrical power from atomic energy . Chicago 's retailers seem equally infected by the innovative zest of the city . And it was Marshall Field , of course , that first annunciated the dictum " the customer is always right . " And Goldblatt 's is acknowledged to be the originator of the shopping center concept in this country . Of the seven tallest structures in the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the John Hancock Center , and the new Sears Tower ( to be completed in 1974 ) . The world 's tallest bank building , The First National Bank , is also here , as is the world 's tallest apartment building , the Lake Point Tower . The John Hancock Center is the world 's tallest all-electric building combining commercial and residential areas : it has a spiral ramp for cars ( 1,400 can be parked on floors 6 through 1 2 ) . The motto of Chicago is " City in a Garden . " Here is one of the mottoes which have been realized in practice . There are 29 miles fronting on Lake Michigan , with a band of green along most of them . On the west stretches a wide semicircle of forest preserve 60 miles long , 35,350 acres in extent . Between these bands of permanent protection , the city has 430 parks . Like the small towns of the Midwest , from which so many of its people came , the streets of Chicago , including many quite close to the Loop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a " Grandmother 's Garden " in Lincoln Park , with old-fashioned flowers , and some new ones , just to keep up with the new breed of grandmothers . The Garfield Park Conservatory has a superb Palm House , and a lush Fernery . The latter contains the astonishing Staghorn Fern growing on rock shelves , and the Walking Fern , named because new plants grow where the ends of fronds touch the earth . No plant is more like Chicago than this fern , forever moving on to new life . However , there is also a most unlike-Chicago plant in the tropical Aroid House . This is the Dumb Cane , of which it is said that if any of the plant is eaten , it will cause temporary paralysis of the throat . In 40 years of visiting Chicago . I have never seen one man or woman or child or dog who had eaten the tiniest shred of Dumb Cane . Park leads to park ? Jackson , Burnham , Grant , Lincoln . Even the new water filtration plant by the lake has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's most attractive , are in parks along the lake and south of the Loop , It was not easy to make that possible . Grant Park , wide and green between the business area and the lake , was once hideous with railroad tracks , dumps , ugly buildings , in spite of a city ordinance stating that the area east of Michigan Avenue was to be forever open . Today 's Grant Park is the result of one man 's 13-year fight in the courts to clear the area . A. Montgomery Ward had started the world 's first mail-order business in a barn loft . When successful , he moved offices to Michigan Avenue and was appalled at what he saw looking east . He had to spend endless time and money forcing the people of Chicago to accept the idea of a park , to which they were legally entitled . The Field Museum of Natural History offers from its top step outside the entrance , looking north , one of the handsomest cityscapes anywhere : Meigs Field for small planes on the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Soldier Field , the Grant Park Bandshell , Buckingham Fountain , and most of the city 's skyline . The building it self is of a luminous marble , but the contents are equally filled with light . A day would hardly cover the exhibits of North American Indians in each region of the U.S.A. , with their daily habits , their religious art objects , their clothing . One of the most gracious paintings by George Catlin , the most prolific artist depicting the Indian , is of a fine-featured Mandan girl named " Mint . " The section of botany offers more examples of trees than I thought existed . There is an inland sea with reconstructions of back-boneless animals from 400 million years ago . Gems and jewels sparkle in the artificial light . Birds , whales of a quantity to please the inland-dwelling citizen . Peoples of Polynesia , Malay Peninsula , ancient Babylonia . The American pronghorn , incorrectly called antelope . Early European cave artists . Above all , the Chinese art , One of the most astonishing displays is called " The Ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the twentieth century has not really been as inventive in cruelty as we supposed . One of the marvels shows the Buddha of the future . ( Among the Tibetans , it was believed that Ga u ta ma would reappear some 4,500 years after his death . ) It is of hammered copper made in Peking , and is the only Buddha shown seated in the Western manner , which suggests that his next appearance may be in Chicago . The Adler Planetarium , neighbor to the Field Museum , has an intricate collection of old astronomical instruments , suddenly as contemporary as the newest moon shot . Those ancient fires , the remote stars , are brought very close to Chicago here . A " New Universe Theatre " is being built underground , a genuine Chicago concept , to put the heavens beneath the earth with a light switch . A special AstroScience Workshop has been set up to give special instruction for high-ability high-school students in the Chicago area , under the National Science Foundation . Forty-two percent of the students have gone on to major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Aquarium , also close to the Field Museum , which brings the warm tropical sea life to freshwater Chicago . The newest thing in 1971 is an artificial coral reef , which deceives fish as well as people . The John G. Shedd Aquarium is the largest in the world ( of course ! ) , and displays the most Chicagoan fish of all , Arapaima gigas , which has grown from eight inches in 1954 to seven feet today . Saltwater for the coral reef was brought in barges from the Gulf of Mexico up the Mississippi and held in reservoirs until the reef was finished . There is an automated light system that provides a full range of illumination from dawn through daylight to evening , and there are spotlights to pick out the most interesting parts of the reef at night . Divers feed the fish twice a day , often by hand . Since Chicago handles more food than any other city , it is natural to think that even fish ought to be fed properly . Thus , the pastel parrot fish usually eat polyps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only nibble on the plastic and rubber of the artificial reef , they are fed a diet of crushed tuna protein tablets and plaster of Paris to mimic their natural food . The Museum of Science and Industry is said to have more visitors than any other museum in the world ? 3 million a year . You can watch chicks being born , go down in a coal mine or a submarine . Now the exhibits turn toward space . It is surely true that any child thoroughly covering the Field Museum , the Adler Planetarium , the Shedd Aquarium and the Museum of Science and Industry would receive an education more visual and persuasive than he is likely to get in any high school . Chicago has always been so inventive in its buildings that the new marvels seem ordinary . The Frank Lloyd Wright style developed here . The Robie House ( now home for the Adlai Stevenson Institute ) is the supreme example of Wright 's " Prairie Style . " Louis Sullivan 's original design for the Carson Pine Scott store elongated windows horizontally and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thus making a building in a garden . The Marshall Field store has an open quality in its courts unlike contemporary department store design . In the Auditorium , Sullivan and Adler made an acoustically perfect building . The important aspect of Chicago 's buildings is that you can see them in the round , or in the square , for this is an open city . Marina City is two circular towers above the Chicago River , has a marina at water level ( so that you can take an elevator to your boat ) , shops , restaurants , 18 floors for cars , and apartments above . These are pie-shaped around a central service core ( is there another in the world like that ? ) , with cantilevered balconies . These are the tallest concrete buildings in Chicago , not glass and steel , but circular discs resting on columns . At a distance , with the sun setting , I swear they can look like golden ears of corn . Go to Old Town and its neighborhood for a look at nineteenth-century Chicago as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Alley and it is on Wells between Division and North streets . Eat here . Then walk around the nearby streets for a look at the Chicago houses which survived the fire , the old-style cottages built one story on stilts , with steps leading up and eight or ten feet of space beneath . Later when the ditches were drained ( Chicago was the first city to have an enclosed sewer system ) , a lower floor was added at street level . The Art Institute on Michigan Avenue is defended against any invader by bronze lions that have weathered a fine green , save for one part ? the curving tails , from much handling , remain a lustrous bronze brown . Within , the unbelievable paintings sparkle on the wall . George Washington , that famous art lover , stands in the arch above the entrance . Here is the world 's great collection of French Impressionists . When a Frenchman protested this residence in Chicago of so many paintings by his countrymen , a Chicago man of quite ordinary modesty ( which means , he enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would not have been available if Frenchmen had had the foresight to buy them , and thus help their own artists . When a Chicago patron was asked how he and his friends could afford to buy such expensive paintings and give them to the Art Institute , he answered , with gentle arrogance , that they did not buy them . They inherited them from their grandmothers . Here are great El Grecos , in this long city in this long landscape , seeming a little longer than on the canvas . Here is Picasso 's The Old Guitarist , of 1903 , everything blue save a blue-brown guitar and some blue-gray hair on the player . Here is Chagall 's Circus Rider , standing bluely on a red horse , one leg up in the air and pointing at a moon pale with astonishment . Here is Grant Wood 's American Gothic , the most intensely Midwestern portrait ever made , a man and a woman , looking very suspicious of the painter , and uneasy about each other . The University of Chicago is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with John D. Rockefeller money in 1892 , it was in the Chicago style that nine college presidents should quit their jobs to become teaching faculty . This city pursues the brilliant mind as it pursues futures in onions , corn , potatoes ? with the single-mindedness of a tornado going its way not caring what is in front of it ? a stone wall or a rose . The University of Chicago has a greater percentage of its graduates take the Ph.D . than any other University , and the greatest percentage who teach . In one year , 167 presidents of colleges and universities were former students or faculty members . It is an upside-down University , with only 30 percent of its students undergraduates and 43 percent in the Graduate Division ( the other 27 percent are in professional schools ) . Its University Press is the largest in the country . The first American to receive a Nobel Prize , Albert A. Michelson , Professor of Physics , was a faculty member ( 28 Nobel winners have been former students or faculty ) . It was typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atomic bomb possible were assembled here . It was also typical of the city of Chicago that , when they wanted to meet and discuss the future without risk of being overheard , they could go outside buildings and meet under a real live tree . When the Chicago Library was destroyed in the Great Fire , a temporary library was established in an abandoned water tank . That Chicago style continues , for the Argonne National Laboratory at nearby Lemont is the country 's leading center for research in the peacetime use of nuclear energy . When the new Accelerator at nearby Weston becomes operational , over 40 percent of this country 's nuclear physicists will be working in the Chicago area . The city explodes in many ways . Sitting on the back porch ( imagine having one in a modern metropolis ) of the apartment of the novelist Hoke Norris on North Park at Eugenie , looking along the block of apartments with kids bashing each other on tricycles , Hoke explained the old violence of Chicago by remarking , " It was always all right for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm the preacher or the schoolmarm . " Live and let live . Die and let die . When the Great Fire spread , many people buried that indispensable symbol of culture , the piano , only to go back and find that it had burned underground . When Theodore Thomas directed the first symphony orchestra in Chicago . he found that symphonies were unwelcome , but that he was expected to play for dancing at the end of a concert . Recently The New York Times , not noted for its humility toward the Midwest , announced that the Chicago Symphony was the best orchestra in the world . When the Spanish Infanta visited the Columbian Exposition of 1893 , 30,000 pansies were strewn before her feet . Make no small plans . If you do , Chicago will ride ruthlessly over you with its own tough style . Driving toward central Chicago from the north , you discover that the most prominent sign over the whole city is that of PLAYBOY . What other city would hoist into the night sky as its most burning symbol the sign for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style . Form ( and what form ! ) follows function ( and what function ! ) .
