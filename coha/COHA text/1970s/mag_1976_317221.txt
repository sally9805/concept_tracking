Big Brother , move over . If the self-proclaimed Peoples Bicentennial Commission-currently waging a revolution against Big Business rather than George III-has its way , secretaries will be tattling on corporate executives , and instead of grilling steaks at dinnertime , wives will be grilling their husbands . The kids have not yet been invited to join the big snitch , but wait . <P> The PBC 's first brainstorm along these lines was an offer to pay $25,000 to any secretary whose boss is imprisoned as a result of her information . Now PBC has sent out 24,000 letters to executives ' wives , suggesting that they ask their husbands if they or any colleagues have been involved in criminal activity . To 1,000 wives of the corporate creme de la creme , tape cassettes have also been mailed . These tapes carry the voice of PBC Founder Jeremy Rifkin , 32 , a Harvard-educated anti-establishmentarian . " Would your husband inform the authorities if he were aware of illegal conduct among friends and associates ? " asks Rifkin . " Would you inform the authorities if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening to start such a discussion ? " And , perhaps , to end a marriage ? <P> PBC Co-Chairman Ted Howard concedes that response to the campaign thus far has been minimal . Nonetheless , he adds , " there is discussion around the corporate watercoolers of America like never before . " Now , if only those watercoolers could be bugged . . .
