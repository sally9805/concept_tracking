txt President Carter , moving to salvage his beleagured energy program , today called on the Senate to " act responsibly " and " reject narrow , special interest attacks on all segments of the national energy plan . " The President 's comments were apparently motivated by increasing evidence that the Senate is prepared to approve deregulation of natural gas prices , which is strongly opposed by the White House . Today , the Senate voted overwhelmingly to cut off a filibuster by liberals opposed to deregulation . Also today , the Senate Finance Committee agreed to drop the President 's proposed tax on domestically produced oil ? the centerpiece of the program  --  although the committee appeared willing to revive the tax if another formula for using the revenues can be found . The ' setback was just the latest in a string of reverses the President 's program has suffered in the Senate , after winning easy approval in the House of Representatives . Votes ' Which Cause Concern ' " I realize that there have been some preliminary votes in the Senate which cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House today . The President 's remarks were considered mild , particularly compared with a far stronger attack on Congress the President delivered last spring . He was also careful to praise the Senate majority leader , Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia , although most observers believe that Mr. Byrd has not been especially effective on the Administration 's behalf in .. the energy debate . He was also less specific than he was in Virginia last weekend , when he said that he would veto an energy bill containing price deregulation . But like his past exhortations to Congress , today 's comments included an attack on the oil and gas industries . " The lobbying efforts of oil and gas industries on deregulation itself show how the special interests are trying to block enactment of the entire energy pro- gram , " Mr. Carter said , after noting that " the House has faced this lobbying pressure and has acted both wisely and courageously . " The President appeared in the White House press briefing room to read his statement under bright television lights and departed abruptly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent 20 minutes at a farewell party for his friend , Bert Lance , in the nearby Old Executive Office Building and seemed cheerful and relaxed , as though the tension of last week , when Mr. Lance resigned under pressure as director of the Office of Management and Budget , had evaporated . Mr. Carter contended that removal of natural gas from price controls would cost the average American family heating with gas an extra $150 a year by 1985 or a total of almost $10 billion annually , while producing " little , if any , new supplies . " The Administration has proposed raising the price of newly discovered gas to $1.75 per thousand cubic feet from $1.46 at present , while extending controls for the first time to the intrastate market . The House accepted this formula . The Senate last week in a test vote refused , by a vote of 52 to 46 , to kill a deregulation proposal . Since then , Senator James Abourezk . Democrat of South Dakota , and other liberals have been filibustering , despite efforts by both the Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote . At the Capitol today , although the Senate voted by 77 to 17 to limit debate , 508 amendments had already been submitted and their sponsors could force separate votes on every one . In response , Senator Byrd threatened his colleagues with late-night and Saturday sessions until the issue was resolved . Tonight , the Senate met until 10 P.M. without making any meaningful progress . Efforts have been made to effect a compromise between the two sides on continued regulation at a higher price , but the deregulation forces , sensing victory , have been unwilling . In addition to President Carter 's veto threat , a deregulation bill in the Senate might mean no bill at all because of the difficulties in reconciling deregulation with the provisions passed by the House . The 11-to-6 vote by the Senate Finance Committee to drop the tax on domestic oil  --  also known as the wellhead tax ? came after a number of members expressed displeasure with the Administration-proposed rebates and voiced support for using at least a portion of the money for energy development . Today , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1981 , a portion of the tax revenues be diverted to producers of the lowest priced oil , so-called " old " oil now selling for about $5.25 a barrel . However , the Administration also proposed that the tax be extended four years , to 1985 , and seemed to imply that continuation of oil price controls in some form would be sought beyond the present 1981 expiration date . Although the Administration spokesman , Assistant Treasury Secretary Laurence N. Woodworth , insisted that the offer was flexible , the modest concessions appeared to annoy committee members , who quickly voted to kill the tax . The Administration would also like all of the revenues from the tax in 1978 rebated to consumers with about 50 percent of revenues thereafter reserved for individuals . This is designed to offset the higher cost of petroleum products , brought on by the tax . The Administration is also believed willing to divert much of the remaining receipts to energy development , most likely in the form of an energy finance corporation . If the wellhead tax survives , it is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concessions that Mr. Carter warned about today in general terms . " There comes a time when we must ask how much is enough , " the President said . ' ' Fair treatment and equal sacrifice by every member and segment of our society are fundamental principles of the national energy plan . " In recent days , Mr. Carter has watched the Senate gut his utility rate reform proposals , eliminate the " gas guzzler " tax , weaken the coal conversion requirement for industry and prepare to drop entirely the proposed tax on continued use of oil and natural gas by industry . Administration spokesmen have suggested previously that , if the energy program is emasculated , new legislation might be presented next year . Rex Granum , the White House deputy press secretary , said that the energy legislation had been discussed at the Cabinet 's meeting today and that Mr. Carter had repeated his pledge to press again next year for new legislation , if needed .                    @
