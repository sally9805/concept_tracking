A Heartbeat Away-Too Close ? <P> <P> To the Editors : <P> <P> Nelson Rockefeller Vice President ? <P> President Ford must be kidding . The ex-Governor has failed in three attempts at another national office , the presidency . What is frightening is that Congress might forget this and confirm him . " A heartbeat away " is too close for comfort . <P> <P> Glen Ashman Decatur , Ga . <P> How a man supposedly as intelligent and down to earth as Gerald Ford can pick Nelson Rockefeller for Vice President is beyond comprehension , unless he ( Ford ) has strings attached to him . <P> Why would anyone pick a Vice President who 1 ) wants your job so bad ( and admits it ) that making you look good is not going to be normal ; and 2 ) has so much money he can not appreciate the havoc inflation is imposing on the middle-class workingman ? Do the oil and banking interests really dictate who is to do what ? <P> <P> Marvin H. Brooks Pitman , N.J. <P> Rockefeller 's dividends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 75 words a minute or 50 letters a day at 500 a letter , it would take me 13 years to earn $80,000 . Maybe if I could increase my typing speed ... <P> <P> Emily McCormack Lyons , Ill . <P> Where did Rocky find mountains while horseback riding in Florida in 1972 ? Even with his wealth , can he move mountains into Florida ? <P> <P> Robert L. Jones Denver <P> He ca n't , and neither can we . Those mountains were outside Palm Springs , <P> Calif . <P> <P> Is your Rockefeller cover portrait carved out of granite or ice ? Either one fits his personality , and they both crack under pressure . <P> <P> Dorothy D. Pelletier Boca Raton , Fla . <P> <P> Notes on the New Team <P> What is all this motherly media clucking about Betty Ford 's and Margaretta Rockefeller 's being " very private " persons ? Are n't we all ? The gals knew what they were getting into , the spotlight , when they took public men as their second husbands . <P> <P> Charles D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " internationalist " libels true internationalists . An internationalist , far from advocating America 's responsibility to uphold international law-and-order , believes the best path to peace is through cooperation and communication . Ford 's view that the U.S. " must be a force on a worldwide basis to try to maintain peace " is the kind of reasoning that got us into Viet Nam . <P> <P> Kenneth A. Buxton Claremont , Calif . <P> I could not suppress a somewhat derisive grin when I found President Ford with his dirty shoes resting on the desk at the White House . To us Orientals , any desk is meant for reading and writing and not for putting shoes on , no matter how spick-and-span they may be . I am horrified to imagine what the new U.S. President will do in his office next . Please ask him not to chew gum while deciding the fate of nations . <P> <P> Eiji Hattori Kyoto <P> Amnesty and Violence <P> President Ford gave a courageous talk to the V.F.W. on amnesty . In the reaction of these bitter men , words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are used over and over . One must believe that they never heard any of the reasons why millions of us believe the war to have been wrong .
