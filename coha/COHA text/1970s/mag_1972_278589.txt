Britain labored under a Dickensian midwinter gloom last week . Off went the garish neons of Piccadilly Circus . After twilight , Big Ben could be heard but not seen . Buckingham Palace was lit by candles and hand torches . Millions of Londoners went to and from work beneath dimmed streetlights . Thirty crews of firemen helped rescue people who were trapped in stalled elevators . Dramatizing the nation 's power shortage , one BBC newscaster had to read his bulletin by candlelight . A general synod of the Church of England also was conducted-perhaps fittingly-by candlelight , but that was not what the prelates had intended . <P> It was Britain 's worst power cutback since electrical workers staged a slowdown a little over a year ago . This time the cause of the crisis was the nation 's 280,000 coal miners , who were striking nationwide for the first time in 46 years . With 70% of the country 's power dependent on coal fuel , the government late last week declared a state of emergency , and power cuts ranging from 10% to 30% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . <P> For the moment at least , Britons were taking it on the chin . For one thing , they have been enjoying the mildest winter in years , so power shortages have not yet raised public ire . For another , the miners ' demands for pay increases of up to 25% have considerable public sympathy . Their basic salaries now range from $47 to $78 a week . Moreover , the government had reacted with something less than urgency to threats of a strike , which had been bandied about since summer . <P> But that mood is likely to change as unemployment rises . Late last week auto and tire factories laid off 30,000 workers-the first of millions who will be without work when power cuts of 50% go into effect this week in thousands of factories . Prospects of an early settlement appear dim . When talks broke down completely last week , Employment and Productivity Minister Robert Carr turned the dispute between the miners and the National Coal Board over to an official court of inquiry , which will take about ten days to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weathermen issued a none too optimistic forecast : colder . And , they might have added , darker .
