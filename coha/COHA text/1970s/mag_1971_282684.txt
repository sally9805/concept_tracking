Jackie is 20 , Tito 17 , Jermaine 16 , Marlon 14 . They sing some , and play guitar . Michael , the lead singer , is twelve . They are brothers , and taken together they add up to the Jackson Five , a group that in hardly more than a year-has become the biggest thing to hit Pop Capitalism since the advent of the Beatles . They had four hit singles in 1970 , two more already this year , four albums , with all ten releases selling in the millions , and one ( I 'll Be There ) already well over 4,000,000 . Teen-age girls besiege their home for autographs and sometimes faint when they sing . They have their own magazine , a quarterly in which fans can revel in a whole issue devoted entirely to the Jackson Five and read things like " Michael 's Love Letter to You . " Stores now bulge with Jackson Five decals , stickers and sweaters . A Jackson Five hair spray and a Jackson Five watch are planned , as well as a television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group manages to be one of the best soul bands in the country . It is also part of the most likable and natural family ever to survive the pressures of teen-age stardom . So Correspondent Timothy Tyler discovered on a recent visit to the Jackson Five in Los Angeles : <P> First of all , they are really the Jackson twelve or 13 , depending on whether you count Sister Maureen , who lives in Kentucky . There are the parents , Joe and Katherine , and Cousins Johnny Jackson and Ronnie Rancifer , who play drums and piano respectively , Sisters Janett , 4 , and Latoya , 15 , and Little Brother Randy , 8 , who is getting ready to join the group . <P> They all live together in a massive twelve-room stucco-modern house on a large lot guarded by an electric gate out in Los Angeles ' sprawling San Fernando Valley . The place is mammoth , flanked by a guesthouse , playhouse and servants ' quarters . But there are only six bedrooms so that Michael-culture hero though he is-has to triple up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to share too . <P> The Jackson fortress wraps itself around a pool ; it has walkways and plants growing all around ; there is a basketball half court , badminton court , an archery range and , inside , a pool table in a sunken rec room and a den that looks like a cross between a motel lobby and the foyer of a Sunset Boulevard record company . The walls are plastered with platinum records ( each signifying $2,000,000 in sales ) and various other trophies the boys have picked up . For furniture , there is a bar , a stereo with big speakers and leatherette couches . <P> The place is almost totally impersonal , the fiercest personality around being without a doubt Lobo , a German shepherd trained to eat anything , black or white , that 's squeaky and carries an autograph book . The family 's closest friends have to wait outside in their cars in the parking lot and call up to the window , " Is Lobo O.K. ? " The kids hold the raging beast down , inside the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front door . Then Lobo is allowed to rush out the back door , a tornado of bristles and snarls , in a vain ( hopefully ) attempt to race around the establishment and up the front steps in time to rip the pants off whoever is going in the front door .
