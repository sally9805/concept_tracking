txt Chancellor Willy , Brandt of West Germany sought to convince the Nixon Administration , Congress and the American public today that the security of Europe and the success of negotiations with the Soviet bloc depended on a continued American military presence on the Continent . The Chancellor , whose Government is negotiating with the Soviet Union , East Germany and Poland for improved relations , delivered his massage during a whirlwind day . It included a twohour conference with President Nixon , a meeting with Secretary of State William P. Rogers , a session with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , a speech at the National Press Club and the tape-recording of two , network television programs . Mr. Brandt summed up his views in his address at a press club luncheon when he said that " the efficiency of the Atlantic Alliance continues to depend essentially on maintaining the military presence of the United States on the European Continent . " No European effort can be a substitute for this , " he said . " There is still no security for Europe without the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat date . The Administration is under heavy pressure from the Senate to reduce American forces on the Continent and a resolution to this effect , sponsored by the majority leader Mike Mansfield of Montana , is believed to have enough support to assure passage . To persuade the Senators that the United States power in Europe should not be reduced in the foreseeable future , Mr. Brandt met for tea with the members of the Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate leadership . Senator Mansfield was not present , but the committee chairman , Senator J. W. Fulbright of Arkansas , said later that the Chancellor spoke " much more frankly than our own State Department does . " Senator Fulbright said that Mr. Brandt " very ably presented his views " in opposing reductions in American troops in Europe . A Senate resolution calling for a reduction would not be binding on the President , but it would create pressures not likely to be ignored . As far as the Administration is concerned . the unresolved problem is how the forces in Europe will be financed after the expiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany pays 80 per cent of the dollar cost of maintaining the troops on West German territory . The annual bill is $950-million . West Germany has served notice that it can not afford these payments after next year . It was in this connection that Mr. Brandt suggested today there should be an " equalization of burdens " among the Atlantic allies . There was no expectation here that this point would be settled in Mr. Brandt 's two meetings with Mr. Nixon  --  they will confer again tomorrow . But the Chancellor gave the impression after this morning 's discussion that Mr. Nixon agreed with him on the broad concept of keeping nearly intact the American military establishment in Europe . Asked after his speech whether Mr. Nixon had set his mind at rest , Mr. Brandt replied , " I did not need any assurances . " He said that this was so because he had read Mr. Nixon 's message on foreign policy carefully and that in their meeting today the President 's words " did not differ from what he told Congress . " In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present United States policy is based on " the desirability of insuring against greater-than-expected threats by maintaining more than the forces required to meet conventional threats in one theater  --  such as NATO , Europe . " The Admiinstration has not defined , however , what the " forces required " in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will be after 1971 . States . I am sure that the interpretation of America 's own interests will arrive at the same conclusion . " Referring to the current talks between the United States and the Soviet Union on limitation of strategic arms , the Western t powers ' discussions with the Soviet Union over West Berlin , and Bonn 's own exchanges with the Communist countries , Mr. Brandt said : " The American commitment is also the prerequisite for future successful negotiations with the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact on a mutual balanced force reduction and on effective armaments limitations . The strategic requirements will have to be discussed and decided upon within the alliance as well as possibilities of an equalization of burdens . " Speaking in fluent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehensive agreements on the reunification of Germany and renunciation of the use or threat of force is the basis of the talks we have started with Moscow , Warsaw and East Berlin . " " They are closely interwoven both as regards substance and timing , " he said . " They are also linked with the important dis cussion on Berlin which the three Western powers have entered into with the Soviet Union . Our policy is free from illusion and nervous haste . 1 . am aware that we shall require ' perseverance to bring these ' talks to a successful conclusion . " The Chancellor 's belief that ' the maintenance of American Reproduced with permission of the troops in Europe at their present level of 310,000 men is both a guarantee of security and a necessary component of the Western negotiating position is largely shared by the Nixon Administration . The United States is publicly committed to retain through June 30 , 1971 , the present level of forces in Europe , but it has             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
