THE SAVAGE IS LOOSE <P> Directed by GEORGE C. SCOTT <P> Screenplay by MAX EHRLICH and FRANK DE FELITTA <P> Watching this movie is like visiting a friend in intensive care . Terrible damage has already been done , and the prognosis for recovery is uncertain . <P> In recent interviews , George C. Scott announced that he has given up acting . ( Anyone who caught his performances in The Day of the Dolphin and Bank Shot would know that he must have reached his decision long before the official announcement . ) Scott wants now . he says , to devote himself to directing . His most noticeable lunges along that line thus far have been a bombastic television version of The Andersonville Trial and a hysterical film on germ warfare called Rage . <P> Now comes The Savage Is Loose , which might most charitably be described as a fearless refutation of social Darwinism . The plot is Swiss Family Robinson with incest . John ( Scott ) and Maida ( Trish Van Devere ) are husband and wife who have been shipwrecked for seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Lee H.

He hunts and fishes , all under the tutelage of his father , while his mother fills his ears with memories of civilization . <P> Father , however , is a scientist , a student of Darwin . He resolves to raise the boy to be a natural man , with the skills and wiles of an animal . As he grows ( he is portrayed at an older age by John David Carson ) , he proves to be more unfettered by convention than Father might have liked . As his mother comments , in what may be the worst single line of dialogue so far this year , " What we 've got is a lusting male . " Nothing will do but that Junior must have at Mom . <P> No Competition . The loutishness of this film is hilarious , but Scott 's participation is sobering and depressing . He acts very badly here . Perhaps the only mark of his actor 's canninesss is that he has surrounded himself with players who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife offscreen ) delivers . under what must have been her husband 's guidance , the most ruthlessly embarrassing hysterics since Marilyn Monroe 's desert outburst in The Misfits . Carson , similarly clumsy , suggests not so much the primitive life as a somewhat furtive one , say , in late-night doorways on Manhattan 's Third Avenue . The George C. Scott of former years , the actor of furious power , would never have worked with Director Scott . <P> J.C .
