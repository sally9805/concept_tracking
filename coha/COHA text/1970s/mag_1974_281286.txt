Uganda 's unpredictable General Idi Amin ( " Big Daddy " ) Dada may be a Moslem , but last week he was sounding off on equal rights for women . Suiting action to his words , he appointed as Uganda 's Ambassador to Egypt Princess Elizabeth of Toro , 34 , once a top fashion model and Uganda 's first woman barrister . The princess has been a firm Amin supporter since Big Daddy seized power in 1971 . She was rewarded with a U.N . post and the job of roving ambassador for Amin . Packing her bags in her Kampala home , the statuesque princess ( her family were deposed as rulers of Toro in 1966 ) said that she would be known simply as Elizabeth Bagaya in Cairo . Sounding like a lady the boss can count on , she added : " I am excited and grateful that General Amin , a champion of the Arab cause , has chosen me . <P> Trouble is stirring in Nirvana . A.C. Bhakivedanta , Swami of the Hare Krishna movement , at a news conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-styled divinity Maharaj Ji , 16 , now counseling his disciples in California . The ascetic swami , whose followers constitute a kind of saffron-robed Hindu version of the Salvation Army , began by saying , " You 've got to decide whether he is God , or a dog . " Noting the young leader 's luxurious life style , the swami declared rather ominously , " He is cheating people , but he will be cheated in a bigger way . When God meets cheats , he can be a better cheat than they . " <P> Blond , blue-eyed and unabashed Christopher Tanner , 4 , of Pasadena , Calif. , looked over his fellow model and decided that a correction was in order . " I 'm going to pull your nose off ! " he cried , tugging at the proboscis of California Governor Ronald Reagan . Chris , who has several birth defects , was posing with Reagan in the Governor 's Sacramento office for an Easter Seal fund-raising poster . " Hey , " grinned Reagan , " I 'm going to take your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tweak . Then he offered his constituent a perk : the jar of jelly beans he keeps on his desk . <P> Emitting a couple of uninhibited shrieks , Mrs. Mark Phillips clung to the toboggan her husband was expertly maneuvering down the fast hill . Having arrived safely at the bottom , Princess Anne regained her composure as she and Mark mingled with the guests at a winter-games party thrown in their honor by Canadian Governor General Jules Leger at Ottawa 's Governmenl House . Obviously enjoying their second official visit abroad together , the Phillipses even made a little history . Where Anne dropped the puck at a hockey game in Hull , Quebec , it marked the first royal visit to the French Canadian province since the 1964 separatis demonstrations against Queen Elizabeth . She scored a success with Hull Mayor Jean-Marie Seguin , who remarked , " She speaks better French than most French Canadians . "
