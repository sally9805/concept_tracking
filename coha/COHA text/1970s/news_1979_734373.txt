txt " the Howard Johnson Company , whose motels and orange-roofed restaurants have been patronized by two generations of American motorists , is being sold to a British concern . The company said yesterday that it was being acquired by the Imperial Group Ltd. , one of Britain 's largest companies , for $630 million in cash . But Howard Johnson will continue to operate as a separate company under its present management , the announcement said , and tourists can expect to receive the same wide variety of ice cream and other Howard Johnson amenities under British ownership . Howard Johnson 's 21,600 shareholders will get $28 net in cash for each common share , according to an agreement in principle between the two concerns . Howard Johnson , whose stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange , has 22.5 million shares outstanding or reserved for issuance , of which Howard B. Johnson , chairman and president , and son of the late founder , owns about 6 percent and the Johnson family about 11 percent . Stock Rose 5 Points Trading in the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at $15.25 per share , and was not resumed until yesterday afternoon . The issue quickly became involved in heavy trading and emerged as the day 's volume leader with 1.4 million shares traded . It closed up 5 points to 231/8 . The takeover of Howard Johnson by Imperial , Britain 's sixth-largest corporation and the world 's biggest tobacco company , is the latest in a series of acquisitions by foreign concerns of major American companies dealing in the consumerproducts or service fields . In the last few years , these have included the purchase by Britain 's B.A.T Industries of the Gimbel Brothers and Saks Fifth Avenue department stores ; the acquisition by Britain 's Cavenham Ltd. of the Grand Union Company retail grocery chain ; the purchase by West Germany 's Tengelmann Group of a 42 percent controlling interest in the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company , and the acquisition by the AgacheWillot Group of France of the Korvettes department-store chain . Effects of Gas Shortage Much of this foreign buying of United States companies , analysts say , was prompted by the relatively high value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American property cheaper for foreign buyers , and the relative stability of the United States economy . However , some analysts , such as Michael Esposito , a vice president of Bache Halsey , Stuart Shields Inc. , believe that the foreign purchases also allow managements and shareholders of American companies to obtain a premium over market price for their shares and provide a needed source of capital . In the case of Howard Johnson , Mr. Esposito added yesterday , the company s recent cusciosure that the gasoline shortage and resulting decline in vacation travel have sharply affected earnings is " probably " connected to the purchase agreement . The American company may welcome the " financial support of an asset-rich buyer like Imperial , " he said . Sir John Pile , chairman of the Imperial Group , said yesterday that Howard Johnson was selected for overseas expansion because " it is involved in fields related to Imperial 's overall structure . " Last year , Imperial reported profits of about $277 million on sales of about $7.6 billion . Based in London , Imperial has interests in hotels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prepared foods , and paper and packaging products . Last year , tobacco accounted for 56 percent of total sales , food 24.5 percent , brewery products about 13 percent and paper , board , packaging and plastics about 6.6 percent . The sale agreement follows several weeks of reports that Howard Johnson was seeking a buyer , although Mr. Johnson said in an interview in The New York Times last month that , while the company had been approached by three British concerns , " I would talk but I 'm really not interested . " Sales Have Suffered Although the Howard Johnson company had enjoyed four years of peak sales and earnings , and recorded earnings last year of $33.6 million on sales of $547 million , sales this year have suffered from the effects of the gasoline shortage . The company , which was founded in 1925 by Howard Dearing Johnson , who churned homemade ice cream in his Quincy , Mass. , basement , today operates about 1,000 restaurants and 500 motels in 40 states and in Canada , the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ franchising concept and the licensing of the Howard Johnson name and products to other companies . At the end of last year , 27 percent of all Howard Johnson restaurants and 25 percent of the motor lodges were franchised . Mr. Johnson is expected to join the Imperial board while Imperial will have a seat on the Howard Johnson board .
