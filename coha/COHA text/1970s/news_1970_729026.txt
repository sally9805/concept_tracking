txt The Preamble and the Bill of Rights of the proposed 1970 Illinois Constitution " are a mixture of the old and the new . Coming at a time of civil turmoil and racial unrest , the most controversial innovations of Article I , the Bill of Rights , are : ? A passage designed to guarantee all Illinoisans the right to own firearms . ? A self-executing provision prohibiting discrimination in housing and employment . Another sensitive issue  --  whether the death penalty should he abolished in Illinois  --  will be decided by voters as a separate question on the Dee . 15 ballot . Injected into the present , 122-year-old Preamble is wording aimed at current issues , calling upon the state to " eliminate poverty and inequality , assure legal , social , and economic justice , land I provide for the fullest development of the individual . " 10 from 1870 Document Unchanged by the Constitutional Convention 's Bill of Rights Committee , however , are 10 of the 1870 Constitution 's 20 sections on individual freedom . Another , providing that " all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intact , but moved to the article on suffrage and elections . Summing up his views on the proposed new Bill of Rights , Elmer Gertz of Chicago , an attorney and controversial advocate of civil rights , said : " Some people have been good enough to say that the Bill of Rights in the proposed new Constitution probably is the best in any constitution in the 50 states . As chairman of the committee , modesty should forbid my agreeing with this statement , but pride makes it impossible for me to deny it . " Gertz , a longtime American Civil Liberties : Union attorney and defender of unpopular causes and personalities , has praise for most of the article , but opposed the right-to-arms section , both in committee and on the floor . The section reads : " Subject only to the police power , the right of the individual citizen to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed . " Coinpromise on Guns The present , century-old state Constitution is silent on the arms issue . As approved , the section is a compromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and downstate Republicans who oppose it . Architects of that move were Arthur T. Lennon of Joliet , a Republican attorney , and State Rep. Victor A. Arrigo Chicago I. Most constitutional authorities , including Dallin H. Oaks , committee counsel , consider the proposal a moderate one which will not affect the state 's present gun owner 's registration law , but will inhibit stronger measures  --  such as an outright ban on all handguns . More importantly , it will rule out confiscation of all weapons by the state  --  an unlikely development , but one feared by rural residents . The many liberals object to the right-toarms passage on the ground that it will deter effective gun control , most delegates believe it will not stop reasonable weaponry legislation and will help sell the convention product outside Chicago . See " Backlash " Reaction The committee compromise also avoided what could have been a bitter , divisive all-out floor fight on the issue between Chicago and downstate forces . There was little objection to the proposed ban on discrimination In housing and employment , but most observers still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  particularly f r o m " white backlash " leaders . As adopted , the section provides that : " All persons shall have the right to be free from discrimination on the basis of race , color , creed , national ancestry , and sex in the hiring and promotion practices of any employer or in the sale or rental of property . " These rights shall be enforceable without action by the General Assembly , but the General Assembly by law may establish reasonable exemptions relating to these rights and provide additional remedies for their violation . " The last sentence highlights the doubt among delegates that the legislature , left to its own devices , would approve such a plan . In the last decade , all proposed open housing measures have been blocked by the conservative Illinois Senate . Reasonable exemptions discussed during committee hearings on the issue include a " Mrs. Murphy 's boarding house " law , under which such establishments would not have to comply . Under the provision , a person discriminated against could take the case directly to court as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dead Lack of opposition to the measure at Con-Con was largely due to recent federal laws and court rulings which make the issue almost moot . To staunch foes , however , such an issue is never dead , and even minor opposition could combine with negative votes on other matters to jeopardize the overall Con-Con document . Companion measures banning discrimination because of sex , hailed as a female victory by women 's liberation groups , and outlawing bias against the physically and mentally handicapped were similarly unchallenged at the convention . Black delegates led the fight to change the Preamble , as they did to obtain the anti-discrimination clause . Main advocate of the Preamble change was Miss Odas Nicholson , a Chicago Democrat and an attorney . Some delegates objected to changing the Preamble  --  a passage almost identical to , tho longer than , the Preamble to the United States Constitution . They contended that trying to deal with current social and political problems thru the Preamble distorted its true purpose  --  to set out goals and standards which are timeless in nature . Most delegates went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Preamble is hortatory ? that is , its provisions are not mandatory constitutional language which must be enforced . Similarly , delegates approved a new section entitled " individual dignity , " which was directed at so-called " folk-libel . " Bill of Rights Changes That passage , sponsored by Arrigo , condemns vilification of individuals or groups because of their religious , racial , ethnic , or national origin . It is particularly aimed at such things as " Polish jokes " and identifying all Italians with criminal elements such as the Mafia or Cosa Nostra . Partial changes in existing Bill of Rights sections are : ? An equal protection of the laws guarantee added to the due process clause . ? A ban on unreasonable " invasions of privacy or interceptions of communications by eavesdropping devices " placed in the section on searches and seizures  --  an antiwiretapping provision stronger than any state constitution now specifies . The right to a prompt preliminary hearing is added to the indictment section , excepting only a prior indictment by a grand jury . The legislature is given the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inviolate " is the right of trial by jury . Added to the clause on criminal penalties was wording providing that such sentences " shall be determined both according to the seriousness of the offense and with the objective of restoring the offender to useful citizenship . " To present language forbidding imprisonment for debt unless fraud is involved , a sentence requiring that a convicted person be " afforded adequate Lime " to pay a fine , " in installments if necessary , " was added . A rewritten clause on eminent domain calls for just compensation determined by a jury for all private nronertv taken for nublic use . Details are to be set forth by the legislature . The present section provides for just compensation , but requires a jury decision only for cases not involving the state . Deleted from the section on the right to assemble and petition is wording requiring that such assembly be " to consult for the common good , " leaving the stipulation that such a gathering must be peaceable . The right to remedy and justice clause is strengthened by replacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandatory word " shall . " Another Sign of Times Another sign of the times is apparent in a new sentence added to the section calling for " a frequent recurrence to the fundamental principles of civil government " to secure liberty ? " These blessings can not endure unless the people recognize their corresponding , individual obligations and responsibilities . " The Bill of Rights was expected to provide explosive debate and prove a serious threat to the convention 's work product , particularly after Gertz was appointed committee chairman . Tho there were some anxious moments , the issues did not prompt the furor at Con-Con which many had anticipated . Most of the credit for that goes to the overall committee membership ? delegates from all political . economic and social walks of life who worked well together and provided balance and judgment . Tho some clauses are provocative , most observers consider the proposed new Preamble and Bill of Rights a reasonable package containing a little something for everyone .                  @ @ @
