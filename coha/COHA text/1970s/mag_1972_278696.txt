Montanans have just rewritten their state constitution . San Francisco Bureau Chief Jesse Birnbaum observed the process and the participants and sent this report : <P> <P> Critic Leslie Fiedler called it an " inhumanly virginal landscape , " shuddered at the " atrocious magnificence of the mountains , the illimitable brute fact of the prairies . " He was right . Montana is elusive , too vast to comprehend . It almost seems indecent for a land so big to have a population so small : 701,000 people in all , or five to every square mile of atrocious magnificence . Each resident reflects the Montana character : a cussed inconsistency that some people call rugged individualism . It is a trait bestowed by birthright ( " You 're not a Montanan until you 've weathered 40 winters , " the saying goes ) and steeped in frontier nostalgia . Montanans are closet cowboys in haunting pursuit of the roundup , even while struggling with realities . Democrats vote Republican , Republicans vote Democrat . The naive are suspicious , the shrewd trusting . Together they brew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink their bourbon . <P> This populist verve was abundantly evident in the way Montanans overhauled their creaky , 82-year-old state constitution . That laborious , 28,000-word document had been written-or more precisely , foisted upon the people - largely by mining interests , who hobbled the processes of government while exempting their own properties from taxation . But it was not until 1970 that the heel-dragging legislature , under pressure from reform-minded citizens , called for a new charter . Appropriately , members of that legislature , as well as all other elected Montana officials , were not invited to participate actively . This was to be a people 's crusade . <P> And it was . The election of delegates to the constitutional convention brought together 100 of the best people of grass-roots Montana . There were ranchers , farmers , businessmen , three professors , five ministers , 24 attorneys , a beekeeper , a retired FBI agent . Nineteen were women , most of them housewives and educators . The oldest delegate was Lucille Speer , 73 , a retired librarian ; the youngest was a graduate student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had in common was virtually complete ignorance of the art of constitution writing and a somewhat unfounded self-assurance . <P> Touch It . Undaunted , the delegates gathered in January in the former mining town of Last Chance Gulch , now better known as Helena , the state capital . Committees were formed . A squad of recent college graduates began turning out 2,368 pages of scholarly reports on human rights , welfare , education , taxation , legislative government , environment . Ordinary citizens and experts alike voiced their concerns before the committees . From the countryside came 1,500 letters filled with suggestions . The delegates studied , argued , hammered out their proposals , and hard work it was . " We had to educate ourselves and write a constitution at the same time , " recalls Robert Kelleher of Billings , an imaginative attorney who fought in vain to change the government to the parliamentary system and legalize homosexuality and prostitution .
