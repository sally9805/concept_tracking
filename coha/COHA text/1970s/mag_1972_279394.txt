One of the difficulties that the Western eye has with the ancient Buddhist art of South Asia is its apparent sameness . With Buddha , as with the Cheshire cat , the form recedes from us but the smile remains . That august smile of calm and benediction , traced on a thousand metal faces , is one of the obsessive presences of Buddhist sculpture , and has given rise to some of Andr Malraux 's most excited dithyrambs on the absolute . <P> The sense of monotony , however , is more a question of culture than of nature . No doubt the differences between one constructivist painting and another would seem just as nugatory to a bonze . <P> For traditional Buddhist art is not about individual style ; still less is it about self-expression . " The aesthetic canon involved is a very simple one , " writes Art Historian Theodore Bowie . " An image is beautiful because it is the Buddha , and one image is not more beautiful than any other . " But the variety and richness are still copious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week at Asia House in Manhattan : " The Sculpture of Thailand , " a collection of 80 bronzes , carvings and goldwork from the 7th to the 19th centuries , lent from the national museums of Thailand and the private collection of King Bhumibol . India , Gautama Buddha 's birthplace , provided the basic prototypes for the image of the god-prince . His representation was no simple matter . Religious texts have fixed it since the Middle Ages ; he had 32 ma jor and 80 minor " marks . " Because Buddha was a prince before his Enlightenment , his head bears the long pierced ear lobes in which nobles wore their ornaments . Because he shaved his hair , Siamese sculptors endowed him with a circle of tight ringlets . Because he radiated superabundant quantities of teja ( fiery energy ) , his statues were gilded and equipped - like the 16th-18th century standing Buddha ( opposite ) - with a finial of flame rising from the scalp . <P> His nose traditionally resembled " a parrot 's beak , " his head " an egg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in short , was fenced about with even more attributes and iconographical details than Christ . <P> Mythic Victory . The sum effect of his " supernatural anatomy " was exquisitely stylized . No muscles or corrugation interrupt the liquid flow of his body ; its smooth , continuous modeling is a supreme metaphor of wholeness . <P> In late Siamese art , this refinement of contour and line often becomes insipid . Yet every detail of a fine Thai bronze is impregnated with communicative power ; it would , for instance , be difficult to find a shape more authori tative and succinct than Asia House 's 14th-15th century hand , its slender fingers raised in the abhayamudra , or gesture of dispelling fear . Buddhism is a discipline of inner stillness ; yet even when movement is specifically shown , it seems to involve the defeat of time . <P> In the 12th-13th century bronze of the divinity Hevajra dancing , the sinuous body , the faintly smiling face , the 16 arms performing their ritual gesture , exist in some sphere beyond contingency . <P> Hevajra was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the subjugator of desire and attachment . His mythic victory over de sire was the enterprise of all great Buddhist art ; and this may be why these Siamese icons of calm seem at first repetitive , and then so consoling , when seen in America .
