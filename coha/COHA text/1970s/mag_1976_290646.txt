With frightening memories of December 's terrorist kidnaping of OPEC oil ministers in Vienna still fresh , finance ministers of the oil producers ' cartel met last week in Paris instead , under heavy guard . They agreed to set up an $800 million fund to make longterm , interest-free loans to less-developed countries , OPEC 'S first gesture as a group to help poor nations that are afflicted with high oil bills . The fund 's main backers , Iran and Venezuela , originally proposed $1 billion a year for five years . Instead , the fund will exist for only a year , and Indonesia and Ecuador said that they could not afford to contribute . Overall , OPEC nations seem to feel that they are doing more than their share to help less developed countries . <P> Are they ? Without question , the world 's poorest countries have suffered most from the quintupling of oil prices since the fall of 1973 . Writing in the January issue of Foreign Affairs , Maurice J. Williams , head of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance of payments deficit of non-OPEC developing nations ballooned from $11.3 billion in 1973 to about $42 billion last year . A big reason : these countries are paying $13 billion more a year for oil than they were in 1973 . They may well need about $20 billion annually in capital aid through the rest of the 1970s . <P> No Break . The oil exporters have refused to give their poorest customers a price break , preferring to help out through direct grants and loans , plus investments in such agencies as the World Bank . OPEC members note that their aid expenditures have made up a higher proportion of their own G.N.P.s than have the contributions of industrialized countries . But the OPEC nations have run staggering cash surpluses and are in a far better position to give . <P> Moreover , the figures for OPEC aid are somewhat misleading . In 1975 OPEC aid of all kinds totaled about $6 billion . But almost two-thirds of the direct OPEC contributions in 1974 and 1975 went to Egypt and Syria ( both net exporters of oil ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the direct assistance granted by OPEC members goes to non-Moslem countries , and 18 of the 42 countries designated by the U.N . as " most seriously affected " by high oil prices have received no aid at all from OPEC members . <P> Nor is OPEC 's generosity likely to increase . According to a new study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. , the collective surplus of OPEC nations plunged from $62 billion in 1974 to $29 billion in 1975 . That drastic rate of decline will diminish as world demand for petroleum picks up again , but it appears that for many oil producers the annual payments surpluses have peaked-and so might their aid commitment .
