txt Charlie Chaplin , bracing himself against the steps of the plane , looked out at his first windy blue American day in 20 years . The legendary exile , whose films have left a 50-year stream of smiles and tears behind him , had shot this scene before , in his film " The King in New York . " The photographers waiting for him at the airport this week were simply doing a final take . In " The King in New York " Chaplin , wears a fur hat , strides down the plane stairs into a sea of popping flashbulbs , then on into a customs room to be fingerprinted as he gives a wry little speech on how glad he is to be back in this country . In this week 's live version , years later , there are conspicuous differences : A whole generation has grown up which never heard of the political and personal difficulties which prompted Chaplin to take up residence in Switzerland . There was n't a hint of fingerprinting bitterness in the arrival of the man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " gala at Lincoln Center this week ; recipient of the Handel Award , New York City 's highest Cultural award ; winner of a special Oscar award in Hollywood April 10 . There are more visible differences , as " the king " arrives in New York . On the verge of his 83rd birthday , he clings carefully to the plane 's stair railing as he steps , letting go only when he 's at a full stop . Then it 's to wave at the crowd of 100 or so press people below , There is a brief scene that might have been snipped from any of his films about the little tramp : Charlie waving at the press , which has come to see him , the press too busy with its zoom lenses and frantic penciled notes to wave back . At first . Then the hands go up , gradually , just a few . He waves again . " It 's too bad there were no real people here to meet him , someone mumbles , but AP phatt The king ' in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Chaplin fans , have n't heard about his arrival time . Only 200 people are glassed in , staring at him through an observation booth . Most of the rest are back in New York , spilling down the steps of the Plaza Hotel with their pink balloons and eager faces . At the airport , everyone presses close to the famous face . It is ruddy from his week 's vacation in Bermuda , his hair pearl white and blowing in the wind . He wears a tan raincoat and says only two words , " delighted , delighted , " although a brief statement had been prepared for him . // *Chaplin ends his long exile // His fourth wife , Oona O'Neill Chaplin , who married him 29 years ago and gave him eight children , is behind him She wears a red and white suit and a hovering , protective smile as they are whisked into a waiting limousine . There had been talk of a golf cart so the Chaplin could ride in comfort to his limousine . At lunch before the star 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " being in New York this week have briefed some of the press . The men are Martin E , Segal , president of the New York Film Society , and David Rockefeller Jr. , chairman of the " Salute to Chaplin " gala held Tuesday at Philharmonic Hall . Mr. Segal estimated that the gala benefit , intended to wipe out the film society 's $90,000 deficit , will probably net only $65,000-$70,000 . The principal concern , though , prior to the gala , was the logistics of the Chaplin affair . Mr. Chaplin 's fragility has necessitated ... a careful pacing off of entrances , exits , placements , to make sure they 'll be comfortable for him . Everything has been considered ' a seating plan for " the king 's " box as complicated as any White House state Ginner ; the timing of the spotlight tobathe him in for some hopefully memorable stills , the degree of the crowd 's crush to see him ( " Is it really alright to put him in front of their plate glass window ? " ) even nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was finally agreed that the speech should precede the screening of both films , " The Idle Class " and " The Kid , " so that the etight camera crews on stage would have a chance to record the event and then get off in the 30 seconds before the lights went down . It was also agreed that it was just someone 's idea of a bad joke that all Chaplin planned to say in the speech was : " I 'm very glad to be here and I hope you like my movies made 50 years ago . " The men who planned a benefit for which some people shelled out $1,000 for four tickets . t , vere not amused at that . But , even if Chaplin had done nothing more than sniff a flower " City Lights " style or brandish his famous bamboo cane , that might have been enough for an audience of Chaplin devotees .
