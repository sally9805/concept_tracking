In a motel room in Imperial Beach , Calif. , the thin man from Arizona puffed nervously on a cigarette as he told his story . Suffering from cancer of the lung , he was told last fall that he had only months to live . Two weeks ago , he came to Imperial Beach , and since then he has regularly driven across the border to Tijuana , Mexico , and visited a clinic where he receives a shot of Laetrile , a controversial drug that has been outlawed in the U.S. since 1963 . Already , he claims to be better . Says he : " I feel now like I 'm not going to die . " <P> Out of Apricots . Laetrile is a drug made from apricot pits and contains cyanide , among other things . It is one of the most long-lived , though probably not the last , of a long series of questionable cancer " cures , " all of which are susceptible to exploitation . Since conventional medicine concedes that it has no sure cure for many types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understandably willing to try anything . Laetrile was developed in 1950 by Ernst T. Krebs Jr. , a biochemist who studied at but did not graduate from Hahnemann Medical College in Philadelphia . Krebs claimed that Laetrile , which he labeled vitamin B17 , can prevent all cancers by alleviating the nutritional deficiency that he is convinced causes the disease . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration , however , disagreed . In the absence of clinical proof that Laetrile actually worked against cancer , the agency refused in 1963 to allow its interstate shipment . <P> Modest Fees . The FDA 's order , however , did not stifle interest in the drug . Manufacturers in Mexico and Monaco are now producing Laetrile , and California 's McNaughton Foundation , which also funds research in diabetes , parapsychology and heart disease , championed its cause . Nor did the FDA warning frighten the desperate . Since 1963 , more than 2,500 American cancer sufferers , many of whom had given up on other treatments , have flocked to the Tijuana clinic , which is run by affable Dr. Ernesto Contreras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Contreras ' claims for Laetrile are as modest as his fees . The doctor charges only $10 for a first visit , $7 for subsequent visits , $3 for a gram of the drug . He says that Laetrile is just " another chemotherapeutic agent against cancer , " though it seems clear that many of his patients feel otherwise . They claim complete cures or remissions after only months on the drug . Their contentions are difficult to assess , since few have submitted themselves for examinations at recognized medical facilities . <P> The U.S. medical establishment has continued to take a hard line on Laetrile . The American Cancer Society and the American Medical Association oppose the drug on the grounds that its efficacy is unproved . So does the FDA , which says : " There is no evidence , either preclinical or clinical , that it would be effective . There is not the slightest hint that it would work . "
