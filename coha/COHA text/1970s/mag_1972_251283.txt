Moonshining is as much a part of the national folklore as the covered wagon Although " moonshiner " originally meant Englishmen who ran brandy and gin along the North Sea coast toward the end of the 18th century , it came to have special application in America to the men who made illegal whisky-quite literally by the light of the moon . While their ranks have been decimated , a few moonshiners still ply their illicit trade in the deep recesses of Appalachia . Feeling rather like David Livingstone in search of the Nile 's source . Correspondent William Friedman was blindfolded and led through the labyrinthine Eastern Kentucky hills to meet one of the last of those who brew " white lightning " in hidden caves . His report : <P> THE battered old sedan wound its way along a narrow ribbon of dirt road in Clay County 's back country . On the way , the former sheriff who had agreed to produce an authentic moonshiner spoke with real pride of the man 's wares . " His whisky 's good stuff-crystal clear , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can get past the smell , it 'll set you on your head or butt faster ' n he 'd blow your innards out for smiling courtin ' - like at his daughters . When I was high sheriff , I put the ax to at least 300 stills , but I never did his , he bein ' my kin . One time he and his old woman had a fallin ' out , and she come down to get a warrant . See , he gets to drinkin ' his own likker and comes home and beats on her , and she gets all hot and comes down and tells the law where he 's got his still hid . So I said I 'd go get him , but I never did . " <P> In the moonshiner 's community , coal smoke rises in thin gray wisps from stovepipes that jut through corrugated roofs . The houses are mostly unpainted clapboard decorated with weathered old Camel and Chesterfield signs ; many are on stilts . The yards are strewn with empty cans , bottles , cartons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patches of corn and tobacco plants . At the moonshiner 's cabin , the approaching car sent two barefoot girls scurrying to their mother , who in turn summoned her husband . His face was a study in seams and his hands were encrusted with years of grit . He wore a green plaid coat , bib overalls tucked into high rubber boots and a John Deere cap . He was immediately suspicious , but loosened up when the sheriff told him , with a perfectly straight face , that the visitor was a distant relative from Chicago . <P> " I 'm 68 years old now , " the moonshiner said as he scratched a hound 's ear . " Lived on this knob all my life . " His mother still lives there too , but his father died a heroic moonshiner 's death in 1951 . " My daddy made his own likker , " he explained , " and died at 64 on a big drunk . Stayed drunk for 13 days on his own bottles ; stuff was so strong must 've burned his insides out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
