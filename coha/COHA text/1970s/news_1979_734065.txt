txt IN THE KITCHEN , where the table was covered with cakes , cheese , and cognac , the eight newcomers sat against the wall and traced the scene of plenty with their eyes . They seemed afraid the sight might vanish , like people looking through coin telescopes who hear the timer ticking and grow frantic that their minute 's up . Sister Bertha Jodwalis cleared her throat . " Here , eat , " she commanded , and the two Lithuanian families , that of her brother , John , and of her sister , Lorraine , relaxed and began to fill their plates . The contrast in their faces was remarkable . Sister Bertha 's , beneath the top of her nun ' s habit , was smooth and had a healthy tone , showing little of her 62 years . But she had spent her life in America . HER BROTHER and sister , on the other hand , although American citizens born in Chicago , had been trapped in Lithuania at the outbreak of World War II and spent lifetimes of incredible suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a biography of the suffering in their faces , and in those of their mates . All four adults , although 10 years younger than Sister Bertha , looked far older . Their skin was pale and etched with lines and wrinkles , and dark circles underscored their eyes . For more than 30 years they waited , while the patient nun from ChicaClose-up With Jeff Lyon go labored to get them out of the Soviet Union . And last weekend it finally happened . NOW , STILL disbelieving , John and Valeria Jodwalis , and Paul and Lorraine Vaicekauskas sat in an American kitchen on South Rockwell Street in Chicago and said a silent prayer of thanks . Then , mostly so the world would ' not forget , they began to tall : about the cruelty of their live : . Their four children , too young to remember the full horror , drifted away to Ma living room . Tney had been teen-agers in 1945 , wnen Stalin made them part of his plan to exile Lithuanians en masse to Siberia . THEY WERE SENT to Vorkuta , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thousands of miles from Lithuania . Each of them was under a sentence of banishment . John Jodwalis , who had been beaten viciously until he renounced his American citizenship and was then convicted of trumpet ' - up charges of // Flight to freedom ends for Lithuanian families // subversion , was to spend 11 years in Vorkuta . He was assigned to railroad construction in the Ural Mountains . Men and women would dig , using only shovels and wheelbarrows , in temperatures that reached 60 degrees below zero . The shovels would barely dent the frozen ground , but each laborer was required to dig 12 tons of dirt a day . They were to fill 12 wagons , each holding a ton of soil . " Our food was one slice of black bread per day and a bowl of watery soup filled with fish heads and fish entrails to give it flavor , " Jodwalis said . THOUSANDS DIED of starvation or frostbite and were tossed into mass graves . Women deliberately cut off their fingers so they would n't have to work anymore . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you complained too much , they 'd put you into solitary confinement , " Jodwalis said . " You had to do everything to avoid it , it was so terrible . They 'd put you into a foxhole gouged into the ground and for two days you were there , with no food at all . Four times I went through that . I do n't know how I lived . Most people did n't . If you did live , they sent you right back to work , without letting you warm up . " Paul Vaicekauskas was in Vorkuta eight years digging tunnels . His job was to load stones , and his quota was 19 tons a day . HIS CRIME ? He had been a seminary student , and they found him " guilty " of spreading religious propaganda . Lorraine and Valeria , who were to meet their husbands in Vorkuta , worked first at roadbuilding and later in sewing sweatshops , where women became so faint from hunger they collapsed . They were guilty of no crimes . Just being Lithuanian was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden shelves , one on top of the other , on mattresses of wood shavings , " recalled Lorraine . " It was so cold you slept in your clothes while bedbugs and lice ate you alive . Once every 10 days the kareiviai , the guards , let us melt some snow so we could wash . They would put a drop of soap on your finger to wash your whole body and your hair with . " THEIR NIGHTMARE in the labor camps ended with Stalin 's death , and they were allowed , after a time , to return to Lithuania . But in the intervening years , the oppression has only grown subtler . Life is still unremittingly harsh for captive Lithuanians . Moscow has been waging a " Russification " program , flooding the onceindependent Baltic nation with Russians in an attempt to dilute the population . - " They 've built dozens of factories in the countryside and staffed them entirely with Russians they 've brought in , " Paul said . " All the banks are staffed with Russians . Only Russians may hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the population now is only 30 per cent Lithuanian . " They have tried , with only mild success , to force the Lithuanians to speak Russian . Professionals are mistrusted . A civil engineer like Paul was making up to 100 rubles a month less than John , who was a laborer in a tool and die factory . Neither of them was doing well , however . PAUL MADE 190 rubles a month . Forty rubles went for rent . The rest went for food . If someone wanted a pair of shoes-45 rubles ? it came out of the food budget . That meant they ate hearts and lungs instead of other meat cuts that month . But since meat is scarce  --  most of Lithuania 's agricultural bounty is drained off to Russia ? it was n't missed that much . Families of less than seven must live in two-room apartments : In most apartment buildings , six families share a kitchen , and appointments must be made to cook food . Bathrooms are shared . If families in the U.S. want to send gifts , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pants suit is $45 ; the duty on a $15 pair of blue jeans is $30 . Job choice is nonexistent . A Lithuanian must take the job he 's assigned . If a Russian wants to take his job , the Lithuanian is out . AS THE NEWCOMERS sat in the kitchen and told their story , they began to gain some distance on the suffering in their lives . It was as if a catharsis were occurring . And very slowly , the coin telescope look in their eyes seemed to be ebbing.
