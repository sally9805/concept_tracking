 | Counterfeit Money Detectors . Do They Really Work ? @# B ill Cooper slips a $10 bill into a transparent carrier , places it under two hold-down clips with Alexander Hamilton face up , and flips a switch on the machine . The bill oscillates under a scan head . Simultaneously , there 's a sound ? almost like a " boioioioinng " ? and the needle on the meter jumps into the plus zone . " It 's genuine , " says Cooper . I 'm watching a demonstration of an electronic counterfeit-money detecting machine , a $450 metal box that looks as ordinary as a battery tester . It is simple on the outside ; a couple of indicator lights , a switch , a button , and a display gauge . But inside resides a sophisticated machine . It can tell , with a high degree of reliability , the difference between real and bogus Federal Reserve notes of any denomination up to $100 bills and as old as 1934 . Big deal . So the box says his $10 bill is real . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I want to see this thing tell me a phony is a real phony . Cooper senses my disappointment . But there 's nothing he can do . He could n't show how the machine detects a counterfeit note because the Secret Service wo n't let him keep any bogus currency around . To make up , he shows another trick . He takes out another $10 bill with " contesado " ( Spanish for counterfeit ) stamped on the front . He puts it in the machine . The needle jumps , and the machine boings . The note is genuine . Genuine ? Because it was old and 78 POPULAR SCIENCE worn , it had fooled a foreign teller . I believe machine , not the teller . We examined the bill undo-r magnifying glass , and I saw the tiny red and silk fibers woven into the paper that are characteriof real money .

After carefu investigation , I learned it 's more accurate than man. , tellers , but not as good as others .

During 1972. the Secret Service confiscated some $27.7 in bogus currency -- a record . Luckily , 83 percent was grabbed before circulation , and only $4.8 million is listed as " losses to the public . " There 's no of telling how much gets passed undetected , since counterfeiters do n't publish annual reports . Says one source " I think the Secret Service figures are only the of the iceberg . " . oHow the Feds make our money hard to copy There are illegal and cheap copies of everything : and our money is no different . Michael Plant of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing sums up their philosophy on counterfeiting : " We know it 's not impossible to duplicate our currency . We just try to make it as difficult as possible . " To find out just how hard it is to copy the real stuff , I toured the Bureau 's money-making plant in Washington , D.C. As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more elaborate than the average printer 's . After I was cleared through security , my guide took me to the printing room . Steam jets around the room control humidity so the ink can dry properly . Four huge printing presses rumbled . They were printing $1 's that day . As I climbed on the scaffold of the presses , I heard the incredible statistics : 7000 sheets per hour at 32 bills per sheet . The presses roll 24 hours . That 's 672,000 bills per day from one press . The money goes through the presses three times ? once each for the front and back , and a third time , called " overprinting , " for serial numbers and the Treasury Dept. seal ( the light green ink on the face ) . " Want to see the plates ? " asked the supervisor . Yessirree . Finally , I got to touch the plates that made Hollywood history for getting into the wrong hands . Each plate has 32 reverse cuts of bills . That 's where the Bureau takes the trouble for printing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ink where there are dark spots , and shallow for light spots . The incised process ? called intaglio ? gives fine , closely detailed results ( " depth , or a 3-D look , " as the Bureau likes to say ) . It is hard to copy sharply with the average printer 's offset press . New engravings are continually being made . Making a bill rec. , meticulous detail and lots of time several engravers work on dif ' sections . One may do the pc-. another the lettering , etc . A generic lathe spins the fine spirals cborders . When each section is okayed goes to the siderographers for as bly . The original engravings are tual-size reverse image . The si grapher transfers the original to a cylinder ( image now positive ) w special press . The cylinder trans the bill 's image to the plates 32 ti one at a time in a four-by-eight ma . The plates have a reverse image of course , the final printing is tive . Dozens of checkers examine sheets for errors . Finally , stacks individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're r to be sent to Federal Reserve ba The reason figures are up is simple : More and more counterfeiters think they can do as good a job as Uncle Sam . Offset printing and high-speed presses allow printers to turn out reasonably good imitations : certainly good enough to pass at the supermarket , probably good enough to pass at the racetrack , and sometimes good enough to get by a bank teller . Quality of the bogus notes varies greatly from miserable ( " like they were printed on toilet paper , " says one source ) to excellent . I saw one phony at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing that was printed with the same intaglio process the government uses . The bill looked perfect . The Bureau technician said it was one of the best he 'd ever seen . But the paper was a dead giveaway . It contained traces of what Bureau lab experts call " optical brighteners " ? organic white dyes used to make paper look whiter . And these brighteners ( Cooper calls the stuff " optical bleach " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Government stock is an expensive blend of rag bond , 75-percent cotton , and 25-percent linen . It does n't have any wood pulp , the heart of most ordinary paper , and it does n't have any brighteners . Currency really a sort of off-white . Only Crane and Co. c ton , Mass. , is authorized to make the paper for F Reserve Notes . , It is illegal to make even the our money is printed on . ) Telltale glow . After checking thousands of 1 , , in 1965 , Bill Cooper discovered that many c feits glowed a peculiar blue-white ( the bright under properly filtered ultraviolet light . This something like the white glow in a Day-Glo under black light ? led to the development of the generation of detectors : ultraviolet ( UV ) scanner They basically allow the user to view currency UV light between 3200 ? 4000 angstroms . Since money does n't glow , bills that do are bogus . Simple . Until Bill Cooper accidentally left a uine $5 bill in his shirt pocket . His wife was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoved it under a scanner . It glowed . Brightness picked up the detergent made it look like a phony . So UV is n't entirely reliable . Accidentally wash money , and someone with a scanner may accuse of trying to pass a phony . But there 's a more mental problem : Some counterfeit bills do n't glow Cooper says that " many to most " of the counte will exhibit chromamorphic response ? they 'll glow der ultraviolet light . Everyone has his own guess when it comes to actual figures . L. B. Tucker , technical director Crane and Co. , says a " good share " of the bogus contain this whitening agent . Steven Vorillas , assistnt director of security at New York City 's Off-Track ting Corp . ( which uses Spectronics equipment ) " only a few " phonies show up under UV scan . One executive at First National City , the world 's and largest bank , contends about " half the r. wo n't be detected " under UV scan .

Thus Bill Cooper saw the need for a more precise detector . That 's what led to the electronic scanner , invented by Cooper and Spectronics ' chief engineer , Jerry Rubler . Cooper was reluctant to disclose the details of the invention ( " so we can stay one step ahead of the counterfeiters " ) , but he showed me a small substrate board which contained the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rubler says it 's " most of it , right there . " But POPULAR SCIENCE pieced together a general description of how it operates . How scanner works . The key to the electronic scan is in the black ink on the face of Federal Reserve notes . Since 1934 , all of our currency 's black ink has contained small amounts of ferric oxide . That gives the ink magnetic properties . A scan head in the machine " reads " the ink on the bill much as the head in the tape recorder translates what 's on the magnetic tape . This signal is then amplified , and the machine emits both a visual and a sonic response . Cooper says the sonic response is more sensitive than the meter on old or mutilated bills where the ink has faded . You may hear the sound , but the needle may not move . Cooper wo n't reveal further details , but operation is obviously more complex . There are two tests , " initial " and " prove , " ( to confirm " real " results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for currency with large Federal Reserve seals ( before 1934 ) and small seals ( 1934 to present ) . It wo n't work on silver certificates or U.S. Bank notes , but there are very few of these left in circulation . Does the electronic scanner work like a bill changer ? Sort of . Cooper says bill changers use a photoelectric scan that accounts for only one characteristic of genuine $1s . But at least one maker of bill changers , National Rejectors , Inc. , uses a magnetic scan head , probably similar to the one Spectronics uses . A spokesman from National says that company 's machine has a dual scan head that reads two locations on the bill . The electronic money scanner differs from dollar-bill changers in at least two respects . First , the changers accept only $1 bills . Second , some changers will reject worn or mutilated $ls , even though they may be genuine . From 49c The clean quality butane i 'S that wo n't c @# No perfect solution .

The Money ner 1250 takes about 10 secon verify the authenticity of one more time than most banks ha N. spend . Cooper 's working on that , Spectronics sets up large UV s ners for big money handling cli Here 's how that works : First pect " bills are culled with a scanner ; tellers fan large stacks bills instead of one at a time . bill with even a trace of bleach confirmed at the end of the day the electronic scanner . Or , it be done visually . Yet even this system wo n't it all . Bills with no optical white never would be detected . Also , source at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing says about five per of the counterfeits analyzed con magnetic ink . It 's possible that t could fool the electronic scanner . How phonies are passed . the counterfeiters themselves ren the real problem .

For example , a prim . is hired to make the notes . T. " manufacturer " who hired him tit , wholesales the bundle to a distributor , usually at 10 ? 25 percent of fat value , depending on quality an quantity , and the distributor sell the bogus bills to salesmen an street passers . It may be sold that or four times before the first victim gets it ( or the counterfeiters at caught ) . Even with the increased reliabil ty of the electronic scanner , mo banks rely on their tellers and cowl ters to catch the phonies visual Officials say that experienced mow handlers will notice something phony about a bill that would ea ily fool the average citizen . Most people do n't check . Steven Vorillas of the Off-Track Betting Corp .

They all agreed , the workmanship was terrible ' and no , I 'd never take it . ' " Counterfeiters correctly assume that most people do n't even bother to check . Vorillas says his tellers and cashiers catch 80 percent of the bogus bills before they take the loss . " The biggest thing for our people is the feel , " he insists . Genuine currency usually feels real ; bogus feels phony . One teller at First National City Bank , however , relies on the portrait . Another looks at the seals ; still another checks the buildings on the back . When a phony bill is discovered , the last person in possession gets stuck . Should your local bank teller catch it while you 're at the window , he will confiscate it ( as an agent of the government ) and give you a receipt . Later , if it 's proved genuine , your money will be returned . Otherwise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's tax deductible . ) If any retailer says one of your notes is phony , he will usually give it back and ask for another . ( It 's your problem . ) However , if he confiscates it , ask for a receipt . Know your money . The government publishes a booklet , " Know Your Money , " so you can learn where the counterfeiters make errors . If you take a minute to check , you 'll spot bad print jobs and lousy paper . Unfortunately , many counterfeiters also read the booklet and make sure to print in great detail those parts of the bills that the government says are most often lacking in quality ( borders , seals , and portrait , for example ) . Some of the good-quality phonies I 've seen have excellent seals often a frequently looked-at spot . At the moment , as the attempt to develop a really 100-percent accurate counterfeit-money detector continues , the big money handlers are relying on trained observers ? as they always have -- to spot counterfeits that flow their way . The Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterfeit money detectors . But they 've rejected them as being impractical , inaccurate , or just not fast enough . ( OTB is so busy , they 're using the UV scanners just for $50s and $100s . ) This is really unfortunate . Because the worst may be ye : come .
