txt Susan Gooding , a former American history teacher from Munster , Ind. , who loved her subject , sits in a Montreal coffeehouse and muses , " All my life immigrant ' meant those people who came over to America in babushkas . It 's weird taking French lessons in immigrant school and realizing that 's me . " Susan and her husband , Rich , a former New York Times reporter , are two of the many thousands of American young men , their girl friends , wives , and children ' who fled the draft or the military over the past five years . They will still be in Canada ( or perhaps Sweden ) when the last of the ground troops have come home from Vietnam . They make up the first major American emigration movement over a single issue ? the Vietnam war ? in modern times , and the only one which faces prison upon return to the homeland . Flow slows down As the war winds down , their existence is bound to stir controversy . Talk of amnesty is beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But President Nixon has said no . At the moment , there seems to be little public support , though some observers believe it will grow as war memories fade . Meanwhile , in Canada , the situation is changing , too , The flow of deserters and dodgers has slowed markedly in the past few months . The Toronto Antidraft , Program ( TADP ) , oldest of the American groups aiding the exiles , says only 10 or 15 new people come in each day , compared with a peak of 40 to 50 a day in the summer of 1970 , Draft calls are down ( there were none at all during the summer months ) , draft counselors in the U.S. are more skilled at helping young men avoid the draft through legal means , and the current job picture in Canada is discouraging . Accordng to the Rev. Robert Gardner , n American who ministers to draft-age immigrants for the Canadian Council of Churches , " Phase 1 is over  --  the flow of educated draft resisters and the later flow of deserters who needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada manned by American exiles are retrenching in services . and their major source of support  --  the World Council of Churches , whose affiliates gave more than $85,000 in 1971 ? may discontinue support after the end of 1972 . Nobody knows exactly how many American exiles are living in Canada . The Canadian Government records the number of young American men of draft age who have received " landed immigrant " ( permanent resident with permission to work ) status . Through the first nine months of 1970 , approximately 19,800 American youths aged 18 to 29 became landed . American aid groups like TADP , which has counseled deserters and dodgers for four years , say the real figure lies between 70,000 and 100,000 . Though this is probably inflated , it is true that many Americans never apply to become landed . TADP says that , for each one it sees , one never seeks help . Including the numerous wives and girl friends who accompany the men , this could boost even a conservative estimate to 30,000 or 40,000. // *immigrants ' in Canada // ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some have married Canadian girls , have had children who are Canadian citizens , and have lost connection with many of the ties which once bound them to the country in the south . Some have become super-Canadians , like one group of new Montrealers who refuse to speak anything but French . Others , less rooted , insist that the pace of life is preferable , less competitive , safer , and cleaner . They say they would not go back if they could . ? A sizable segment of those who are fairly well settled  --  it 's impossible to tell how many  --  still find difficulties in adjusting to the subtle differences of Canadian life . For some the tempo is too slow , for others the " action " is back home , and for still others there is , under the bitter denials , a desire to go home . ? Those with serious problems of adapting are largely but not entirely centered among the younger , less educated deserters and among increasingly younger dodgers who still arrive . Many are unable to get " landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . Jobs are tight Jobs are tight in Canada , especially in the wake of the 10 percent surcharge imposed by the United States on Canadian exports . Aid centers say many employers are unwilling to give jobs to Americans ; American subsidiaries in Canada often forbid the hiring of draft dodgers . Even when firms are willing to hire Americans , they are often pressured by individual Canadian immigration officials frequently hostile to incoming dodgers and deserters despite the official government policy of nondiscrimination . Almost anyone can enter Canada as a visitor , but getting " landed " is decided by a point system that weighs education , skills , age , etc . Most Americans try to get " landed " at the border , which requires a written job letter . Some attempt to get " landed " from within Canada ; if they fail they can start a lengthy appeals process , which gives them a reprieve . Jack is 18 , with short blond hair and a budding moustache , a friendly , puppylike , and slightly bewildered air alternating for brief spells with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town in Washington . He wears the khaki pants , white cable sweater , and green Army jacket he took with him when he deserted 21/2 months ago . " I had been in the drug ward three times and I was really scared , " he said . Jack , who still is not landed , deserted shortly after some drugs were found in his locker . He arrived in Toronto almost penniless and eventually found his way to the TADP , which found him housing in a commune . He has long overstayed his welcome and is allowed to remain only because of the pleas of one sympathetic commune member . During the days , he gets up at noon , wanders over to TADP , walks around the city , and at eveningtime heads for the Cabbagetown Coffeehouse , a new hangout founded by an ex-deserter near Toronto 's wino skid row . Jack 's problems are not unlike those of many other young deserters who gravitate between TADP , Rochdale College , an 18-story communal-living structure loosely connected with the University of Toronto which seems to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including a basement in the central YMCA , that allow young transients to sleep free for a week or longer ; and a number of communes , mainly American populated , which take in dodgers and deserters as a matter of course . Dan Zimmerman , a counselor at TADP , thinks many of these young men would be better off in the States . " A lot of guys do n't know the details about Canada , reach a crisis in the Army ? not necessarily connected with Vietnam ? and take off completely unprepared . " Not all deserters are jobless or desperate by any means . Spence , a high-school graduate and enlistee who deserted from the Navy after a year of nuclear submarine training , has a job loading oil drums in a Toronto suburb . Colby Seams , a deserter who formerly taught school in Maine , worked his way up from a bookstore clerk to ownership of a bookstore . He and his wife , Karen , are comfortably settled in Kitchener-Waterloo . Other exiles , perhaps a minority , have become super-Canadians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadian citizenship . Stan Pietlock , a short-haired Fordham University graduate and dodger who arrived four years ago and edits an exile magazine called AMEX , insists , " It 's really a wonderful thing to live in a country which does n't worry all the time about being first in everything . " Stan , sitting in a carpeted book-lined living room with classical music on his stereo , looking out on one of Toronto 's many lovely parks , says vehemently , " There is so much hope up here , so much experimentation , so much you can do , why ever go back ? " Surface similarities of Canada and the United States often mask subtle differences of pace and tempo which American immigrants find hard to get used to . Peter Lando , for instance , a young American novelist with a Canadian-born toddler whose wife , Gail , has an excellent job in a Toronto children 's library , has the surface appearance of a successful immigrant . But a certain nostalgia for some of the characteristics of its people remains . " I miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the American news first in the papers . " Said Gail , " Everything here is sort of gray , like a cross between English gentleness and trying to be American without succeeding . "
