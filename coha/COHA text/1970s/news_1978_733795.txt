txt WASHINGTON ? Federal blue collar workers are being paid up to 12 per cent more than people doing the same jobs in private industry ? at an extra cost to taxpayers estimated at $2.4 billion over the next five years . The Carter administration has proposed revising the federal blue collar wage system to abolish this " bonus " for government workers , but the idea is getting nowhere on Capitol Hill . The Carter proposal was submitted in January , 1977 . So far the administration has not even managed to get anyone in Congress to sponsor the bill , let alone promote and push it . ? Meantime the Defense Department , which employs about 80 per cent of the federal government 's 450,000 blue collar workers , is stuck with a wage bill for next year that it figures is $136 million higher than it should be . " WE 'RE ALWAYS catching hell " about rising defense budgets , a Pentagon official said , J'but we 've been pushing this thing wage policy revisions to reduce costs for three years now and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even get someone in Con. gress to introduce the bill because it 's political dynamite . " It is political dynamite because labor unions , most notably the American Federation of Government Employes , are opposed to the revisions package . The present wage policy is contained in a law that was passed in 1972 . It was dratted largely by the AFGE , and it was supposed to provide federal blue col : lar workers with pay rates equal to those of workers in private industry on the basis of local " prevailing wages " in 135 different parts of the country . The prevailing wage rates are determined by surveys of private employers and a wide range of occupations such as mechanics , electricians , and truck drivers . IN PRACTICE , a 1975 government study found , the present system results in federal workers being paid more , often substantially more , than people doing the same jobs for private employers . In addition to being unfair to private sector workers , the administration and other critics of the present system say it puts the government in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration wants to make five changes in the system , the most important being a reduction in the present " 5-step " wage steup . This requires that there be five pay grades for each job ? the first at 96 per cent of the local prevailing wage , the second at 100 per cent , the third at 104 ' per cent , the fourth at 108 per cent , and the fifth at 112 per cent . The basic " pay line " is set at Step 2 1100 per cent and workers are virtually automatically promoted to Step 5 112 per cent in 51/2 years . ON THE AVERAGE , according to Pentagon officials , Defense Department blue collar workers are at Step 4 , and more than half of them are at Step 5 . This means that the average Defense Department worker is being paid 8 per Cent more than his private sector counterpart , and more than half of them are being paid 12 per cent more than the local prevailing wage .

These figures are based on " levels of work " rather than specific jobs , and a variety of jobs might fit in each category . By comparison the Step-5 wage rates for federal blue collar workers in the same categories are , in the same order , $6.29 , $7.35 , and $9.09 . This is in addition to annual wage adjustments federal workers get to keep pace , with changes in local prevailing wage rates , according to Pentagon officials . PRIVATE INDUSTRY generally has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminate the mandatory " 5-step " system . The Defense Department estimates it could save $1.7 billion in the next five years if the present step system were replaced with a policy of making federal and private wages comparable on a simple " average to average " system . The present system also provides for night shift differentials of 7.5 per cent for the evening shift and 10 per cent for the overnight shift , on a national basis . This , too , is out of line with practice In private industry and amounts to a substantial advantage for federal employes . The unions insist that wage rates be set on " local " prevailing wages , but that the advantageous night differential system be figured on a national basis . THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT figures that bringing differentials into line with the private sector would save $20 million over the next five years . A third crucial change sought by the administration is elimination of . the socalled " Monroney Amendment , " named for form e r Democratic Sen. A. S. " Mike " Monroney of Oklahoma , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Tinker Air Force Base . The amendment requires that wage data be " imported " from another area when there are not enough workers in a particular specialty to determine a " local " prevailing wage rate for that specialty . This is unnecessary , the administration contends , because the present system measures pay rates for " levels of work " rather than specific jobs . " Importing " aircraft industry wage data from Tulsa , Okla. , into federal wage structures in Oklahoma City , for example , costs the government as much as $1.26 an hour for some workers , according to Defense Department figures . ELIMINATION OF the Monroney Amendment would save $204 million over the next five years , the Pentagon estimates . - Governinentwide , the administration figures its proposal would produce savings of $2.44 billion from 1979 to 1983 . But that proposal has wound up in a House subcommittee on compensation and employes benefits , headed by Rep. Gladys Noon Spellman D. , Md. , whose suburban Washington constituency includes large numbers of federal workers . As subcommittee- staff director Ron McCluskey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reception . " One of the problems , " he fumed , " is that we had a President ( Carter ) come in and swallow this crap whole . " He said the subcomraitte " is just not convinced " , that the figures presented by the administration and the Defense Department are accurate . " I CA N'T SWALLOW this made-up. stuff from the Defense Department , " McCluskey said , adding the suggestion that the department and " the President himself " coulf have " prefabricated the figures showing federal workers are paid more than private employes . He suggested that federal employes are being unfairly picked on by the press and the public as being overpaid and underworked and said " there are a bunch of bums in the private sector , too . " " If you 're looking for dirt , I 'm not going to give it to you , " McCluskey told a reporter . The subcommittee also apparently is not going to give the President the reforms or the savings he has proposed . An official at the Civil Service Commission conceded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is not sure whether it would even be re-presented next year , given the failure so far to find a sponsor .
