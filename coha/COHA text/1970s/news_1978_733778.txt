txt HE WAS A BIG man . Tall , deeply tanned , rolling on the floor with his baby daughter and talking about breaking the law . " When a guy needs help you just get in there and do what needs to be done , " he said . " No sense trying to figure out who owes what to whom . Ca n't do it anyway . There 's no point . " You 'll get it back later when you get in a bind and he helps you . " The man is one of America 's 8 million farmers , most of whom routinely break federal law , do n't know it , and would n't care much if they did . THAT AFTERNOON he was talking about helping a neighbor --  " I help you plow your ground until my ground dries , you help me plant when your planting 's done . " The lawyers in Washington have another name for that kind of helping . They call it barter . Calling the concept of helping your neighbor a form of barter may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the country . And Washington is concerned . " There 's no question about it , " said Larry Batdorf of the Internal Revenue Service . " The value of goods and services received must be included in income . No question about it . " THE IRS would be hard pressed to track down farmers who are helping each other and not declaring it on their tax forms . However , a group of businessmen in the Southwest discovered the IRS has better vision in the cities . " They 'd set up a bartering bank , " Batdorf explained , " and placed a dollar value on various things . Then they took the position these transactions did n't count for taxes . We told them otherwise . " Taxes , or the possibility of avoiding them , provided much of the motivation for barter 's reentry into the American lifestyle . But as the craze-fad-alternative has grown , the insiders have become wiser . " WE TELL our people to declare it . // Barter makes comeback // all of it , " said Jerry Bender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles . " That 's our policy . " And that 's the law , of course . Mutual 's 10,000 members , who barter $2 million worth of goods and services a month , might be wise if they went along . The group 's system ' , calls for credit cards , extensive records , and monthly statements of bartered " credits " exactly equal to $1 each . One member can buy from another with the credits he has on account . Those credits can be very useful . " WE HAVE one member who paid for his daughter 's wedding with his credits , " Bender said . " Flowers , gown . Everything . He even found a bakery *where he could get the cake . " Other deals sound just as strange : A Florida dentist drills teeth in exchange for remodeling work on his swimming pool , an office worker uses credits for flying lessons . " Some people wilt drive clear across town to a special shop , " Bender said , " so they can spend their credits . Especially in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with customers falling into different categories  --  depending on whether they deal only in services , or I are craftsmen , or are hard goods businessmen . Some categories have to come up with a percentage of cash in the barter deal . But for Mutual and other barter groups that have sprung up around the country , the pitch is the same : You 're spending your time , which you have , instead of money , which you may not have . As a result , an optometrist member might provide an eye examination in exchange for a lamp from a furniture store owner . SOME ARGUE , of course , that time Is money and more time spent working would have provided the money for the lamp . " But dollars are hard to get , " Bender said . " This way they can ' spend ' the time they would have been wasting . It 's business or buying power they would n't have had otherwise . " Hundreds of companies and clubs like Mutual have been formed around the country in the last feu , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One extreme example may be Free For All , another California company . " We 're a free sharing group , " said Richard Johnson , administrator . " There 's no quid pro quo . " THAT MEANS YOU give what you can fixing a porch or drilling a tooth , up to an established weekly limit . And you get what you need from other members up to the same limit . But all the organizations have problems sometimes , and getting as much as you 've given can be one of the biggest . Some members openly complain that they ca n't spend their credits getting people to do the things they want done . Unspendable credits , they say , are n't worth much . Nonetheless , the barter moveinent appears to be growing . In Chicago , however , the most active group does n't like to think of itself as a barter group at Column 1 all . " WE 'RE MOSTLY involved in educational and recreational areas , " said Ed Dobmeyer of Evanston 's Learning Exchange . " We 're not primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bartering involved if the people choose that . " The Learning Exchange has been around for years , and , as Dobmeyer is quick to point out , the exchange 's emphasis is on languages , the arts , and special skills . " We bring people together , " Dobmeyer said , " people who want to learn a language or a skill . The people who teach are free to set a fee if they want to , or they could trade or barter if they wanted . But there 's little hard bartering . " RIGHT NOW , THERE 'S little hard bartering like swimming pools for teeth anywhere in Chicago . At least , nothing to compare with Califoniia 's bartering rush . In the country as a whole , the figures produced by unorthodox financial arrangements might be rather large . The Institute for Socioeconomic Studies has estimated that 10 per cent of the country 's gross national product is generated by an underground economy , costing the federal government $40 billion a year in unpaid taxes . Not all of that , however , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the economics department at Bernard Baruch College in New York City . But it is possible to know there are more and more companies and clubs involved in bartering . And it 's obvious more people are talking about it . AT ANY RATE , bartering has some strong advocates , including most of the governments in the world . International swaps of merchandise are common , especially between East and West where currency problems come into play . Eastern countries , because of trade deficits , sometimes have trouble coming up with hard currency . So they trade goods for goods . At America 's consumer level , bartering obviously also is aimed at a currency problem , in Gutmann 's view  --  a problem of raising money for the tax man . " I 'm cure most people engaged in barter do n't claim it on their income tax forms , " he said . " That 's much of the incentive for being involved . " The IRS is well aware of that incentive but approaches the subject carefully . " THERE ARE MANY small Items of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Batdorf said . In other words , if no one makes a record and tells the IRS computer you were paid or were involved in a trade , the computer can only pretend it did n't happen . The same is true for the boy who washes your windows and is paid out of petty cash . " That 's what it all comes down to , " Gutmann said . " How 's the government gon na know ? "
