txt The offices of the Consolidated Meat Distribution Center here seemed no different from hundreds of similar ones on the Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan , with bright colors and modern furnishings . Two walls of the reception area are paneled in wood , while a third is covered from the floor to the ceiling with a mural of a forest . as if one could step from a desk into the woods . The fourth wall is solid rock , its rough finish given a glossy paint job and its jagged edges rounded . But such a setting is deceptive : The offices are in a cave near here , 200 feet below the earth 's surface , and it may be the ultimate solution to the energy crisis , as its proponents believe . The cave is an old limestone mine owned by the Inland Storage Distribution Center , a division of the Beatrice Foods Company . It is one of 15 underground storage facilities in the KansasMissouri area , where millions of pounds of foods are stored for distribution to the Middle West and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Truman Stauffer Sr. , a geoscientist at the University of Missouri who recently received $83.000 from the National Science Foundation to study the feasibility of mines as storage and office space , said there were other storage facilities at three sites in Pennsylvania , two on the Hudson River 100 miles north of New York City , and in Colorado Springs and Salt Lake City . " There 's not much use nationally , but they 're very extensive in this area , " Dr. Stauffer said . " Besides the 15 in use , there are 15 others that could be used . " To such proponents as Dr. Stauffer and Victor J. Mersten , general sales manager for Inland , going underground is a natural energy-saver . The office temperature is a constant 58 degrees - and there is never a weather problem , Mr. Mersten said . Jack Accurso , president of Consolidated Meat , whose company has been underground for four years , said that employee efficiency increased signifiContinued tin Page 66 , Column 4 Some Companies Go Underground // cantly because " they ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But it 's scary , " said Shirley Nastav , who works for Mr. Accurso . " I had claustrophobia until I got used to it . I just put it out of my mind . " Dr. Stauffer agreed that the psychological problem of being underground was a fundamental one . " But once people go underground , they like it , " he said . " I know employees who have been underground for 30 years , and they would n't want to work above ground now . " Most of the 2,000 workers are used to it now , he added . An automobile tour of Inland 's mammoth office and storage center ? it has 20 million cubic feet , 5 million of which can be used for storage ? is an eerie experience . The car 's lights flash on the low-hanging , 16-foot ceiling and against the huge posts as the vehicle negotiates mile after mile of winding roadway . " I love it , I love it ! " Mr. Mersten , the tour guide , exclaimed at one point . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storing food in old mines is not new ; the Egyptians did it 5,000 years ago . Mr. Mersten said Inland decided to store food underground when its founder , Leonard H. Strauss , ended up with some empty caves after extracting the limestone . " He took an idiot concept  --  food storage in a cave  --  and made it work , " Mr. Mersten said of Mr. Strauss . " He started in business with $10,000 and now he 's worth $150 million . " While many different items , such as wire mesh , structural steel , recreation vehicles and furniture , are stored underground , most of the space is used for frozen foods . Acres of frozen foods are stacked in walled-in rooms where the temperature is kept at 30 degrees below zero . Mr. Mersten said this method of storage was very economical . Being 200 feet below ground , there is no need for thick walls to absorb the summer heat . He said it was one-third less expensive to cool or heat underground . " And when a company needs more space , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " We 'll have 60 million cubic feet by the year 2030 . " Other advantages of underground warehousing and office space include better control of noise and vibration and lower rents and fire insurance rates . Dr. Stauffer said that more than 100 companies in this area , providing $20 million in salaries , were located underground . He said a major reason that the caves were not used more widely for office and storage space was that " a lot of people on finance boards who make business loans do n't even come to take a look at the sites , so there are a lot of bad connotations associated with the psychology of going underground . " " And for another thing , " he said , " the Federal Government has n't paid much attention . It 's been a private enterprise thing so far . "
