Nostalgia is Broadway 's top growth industry . And how could a stroll down the fond memory lane of great musicals be complete without a revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein 's The King and I ? The first and only true King , Yul Brynner , still rules the stage in the way that a mountain peak dominates its surroundings , and he has proved as immutable in appearance . Audiences have been humming the enduring , enchanting score ever since the opening night of 26 years ago . This production dwarfs recent musicals in its opulence . The dances , originally choreographed by Jerome Robbins , are drolly captivating . Constance Towers ' Anna is singularly lovely in voice , mood and bearing . To an age that is brazenly explicit about sex , The King and I brings the veiled , beguiling reticence of old-fashioned romance .
