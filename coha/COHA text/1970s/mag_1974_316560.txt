" I have not had unfortunate experiences with the press . " <P> That is one point Henry Kissinger made at his extraordinary news conference in Salzburg that no journalist will dispute . In the 5 years that he has been shaping U.S. foreign policy , the Secretary of State has never lacked a large and enthusiastic following in the press and public . They have applauded his statecraft spectaculars , been entertained when he stepped out with starlets , and generally turned to him for relief from the sullenness and secrecy that have characterized much of the rest of the Nixon Administration . <P> Thus there was an odd ring to Kissinger 's petulant suggestion at Salzburg that he had been getting a raw deal over his role in wiretaps ( see THE NATION ) . Until the issue is settled , the only incontrovertible fact in the affair is that it has prompted open questioning of how the press has handled the supersecretary . Says Investigative Reporter Seymour Hersh , whose New York Times story on the taps fanned Kissinger 's wrath : " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that other officials have . I think he should be treated the same way everyone else is in this town . " <P> Indisputably , a kind of special relationship has developed between a usually admiring press and a courting Kissinger over the years since he unpacked his books in the White House basement in 1969 . If Kissinger feels that he has been gored on the taps , there are plenty of other episodes in which the press has let him off lightly . Two leading examples : <P> Kissinger 's celebrated declaration 13 days before the November 1972 presidential election that " peace is at hand " in Viet Nam was not widely questioned in the press until well after the President had won his landslide victory . As it turned out , the secret negotiations had broken down badly , and peace was not to come until January 1973 . But the matter was quickly forgotten in the euphoria following the ceasefire . <P> When Nixon put U.S. forces on alert early in the Middle East fighting last fall , Kissinger told the White House press corps that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortly . The explanation never came , and few reporters ever took him to task for it . <P> Kissinger has often talked of his relations with the press in terms of mutual trust . As he told ABC News ' Ted Koppel recently : " If you mislead the press consciously and you 're caught at it , your credibility is destroyed forever . " Kissinger set out to secure tight control over the press with his very first National Security Council staff meeting in 1969 . He alone , he told his aides , would deal with newsmen . Roger Morris , a former Kissinger assistant , recalls in an article in the current Columbia Journalism Review that he and his NSC colleagues " were authorized to explore secret negotiations , even to edit the ceaseless outpour of Kissinger 's diary . But none of us was trusted to deal with that most sensitive and perilous phenomenon of them all-a journalist . "
