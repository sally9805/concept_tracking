txt There is smog and then there is smog . Many city dwellers are familiar with the brownish tinge of air pollution . In New York , Chicago , Boston , Denver , Houston , and Philadelphia , smog can be troublesome , irritating , and once in a while hazardous . But those cities form the minor league of smog cities . In the big league there is but one city ? Los Angeles . After clamping tough emissions restrictions on California automobiles , after designing elaborate schemes to eut down on pollution when smog reaches extreme levels , and after more than a decade of close study and concern , Los Angeles is still gripped throughout the sticky summer months of " smog season " with a brutal , choking cloud of pollution . The contrast with other cities is striking . Flying out of Boston , a city that accumulates some of the East Coast smog as it drifts north and east with the prevailing winds , a jet climbs quickly through a thin haze that , while clearly visible , only partially obscures the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the jet passes the clear-skied mountain ranges to the west and northwest of the city and descends into a thick shroud of smog that cuts off visibility of the ground minutes before landing . In Boston , between May and September , smog sometimes settles in for days at a time . The federally accepted " safe " ozone level was exceeded 40 times in 1975 , according to Dr. Anthony Cortese of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Engineering . In Los Angeles during that same stretch of summer months , it was exceeded 105 times . In 1978 the problem is acute . The worst smog levels in five years were recorded in the Los Angeles basin on July 14 and 15 , prompting the South // From page 1 Los Angeles Coastal Air Quality Management District ( SCAQMD ) to call a " second stage " alert . And , for the first time in history , the alert was accompanied by a broad set of preplanned steps to keep the ozone level from rising too high . Manufacturers , contacted by SCAQMD through a special radio network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commuters who worked at large businesses were ordered to travel at least three to a car ; others were turned back from company parking lots . Petroleum terminals in the Los Angeles-Long Beach harbor were shut down . Citizens were advised to stay indoors . Those people " sensitive " to pollution were told not to exercise strenuously . Some 3,000 businesses that are required to have emergency smog plans on file with the SCAQMD lose , according to their estimates , about $5 million each day due to production curtailment . Despite the gritty cloak over the city , officials say that the situation is improving and that more progress can be expected soon . " It would be difficult to boast about the clean air in light of the past recent incidences , " says . Jeff Schenkel of SCAQMD , " but despite the highly unusual meteorological incidences of the last few weeks , the air-pollution picture has come a long way in Los Angeles . " Nonetheless , the smog continues . The Southern California Association of Governments continues to grapple with such plans as increased rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to detect pollution violations . But in a city with little public transportation , millions of cars daily pump exhaust into the atmosphere . Fried by strong sunlight , and contained by the geographic boundaries of the city 's basin , the hydrocarbons and nitric oxides of the exhaust form ozone in the air . While the same number of cars travels around the city in both winter and summer , it is the meteorological quirks of summer that turn the basin into what Mr. Schenkel describes as a " pressure cooker " of smog . Without a breeze to dissipate the smog beyond the mountains ? but just enough to disperse it west around the basin ? the smog simply accumulates , forming a false cloud cover of filth . Smog is not a popular topic of local conversation . " Just think of it as harmless fog , " said one Los Angeles citizen , " and it does n't bother you as much . " The Los Angeles Times , editorializing about the recent problems , said : " We intensified our search and actually found two people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their homes . ... Maybe those who say there is n't smog have stumbled on the answer to the smog problem ? just say it does n't exist . "
