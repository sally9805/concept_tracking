txt IT IS A policeman 's neighborhood of brick and cedar bungalows and backyard swings , family German Shepherds , and St. Jude emblems . A neighborhood where the husbands come home at irregular hours . The neighbors in the little community just southeast of Midway Airport pay a lot of attention to those arrivals . They wait for the small signs , the slam of a car door , the stamping of snowy feet on the stoop . A month ago , Ed Kendzior did n't make it home . The neighbors knew it . Kendzior , an Area 4 auto theft investigator , had been wounded in the stomach by a shotgun blast in a shootout at 1618 W. Beach Av . BUT NO one thought too much of it Monday night when Harl Meister did n't come right back . Meister , who lives only a few doors south of Kendzior , was off duty for the two days before Christmas . The neighbors saw the Marq u e t t e District patrolman , dressed in old clothes , pile into the family station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick trip to a nearby Community Discount Store . Four teen-agers are charged in slaying of Patrolman Harl Meister . Page 22 . Minister weeps for son held in slaying of policeman . Page 22 . Meister , a handyman who had helped nearly all the neighbors around him with their little household projects , was working on his bathroom . He had skinned his fingers putting grouting on the walls and needed new gloves . the NEIGHBORS waited and m i n u t e s expanded to hours . But the 36-year-old Meister was n't going to come home . Something as commonplace as a trip to the store can become a moment of destiny for a policeman . " He was off duty , but I say he was killed in the line of duty , " said his brother in law , John Giltmier , Tuesday morning . " He pulled his weapon . His last act was that of an officer . " Giltmier , 33 , a policeman whose beefy arms in a shorts l e e v e shirt were turning white from cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front porch . " HE WAS a hell of a policeman , Giltmier said . " A gentle skinny guy , maybe , and the last guy in the world you would take for a police officer , but what is a policeman anyway ? The 6 foot 4 image or a scrawny guy with the instincts of a rabbit ? " He had those instincts , the street instincts . They ca n't teach you that in the academy . All they can teach you is to type a report . " They ca n't make a guy into the kind of cop who , when a crime happens and the suspect rims - away , just happens to go the right way and run right into him in time to say ' Hi . ' That was Hart . " MEISTER WAS an only child who grew up in a rural area outside Toledo . He was in the Navy for eight years , and while serving in Chicago as a shore patrolman he met Giltmier 's sister , Judy . " We became his family . He never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Giltmier , who is in the K-9 patrol . " I guess he admired me , and it was me who got him into policework . He used to like to run with me , do what I did , but he did it so much better . " This was n't the first time tragedy has struck the Meisters . Five years ago their son , Hari Jr. , died at four months from crib-death syndrome . " I GUESS the name Hart is a jinx , " said Giltmier , who suddenly broke into tears and called for an outright ban on all guns . " They say we need guns for the Communists . Well , Jeez , the Communists could n't come in here and do as good a job as we do on ourselves . " Meister 's neighbors say he was a quiet , dedicated family man and a good friend , always running over with a wrench and screwdriver to help . That 's how Mrs. Michael Carey next door remembered him , and Walter Schauer , Meister 's best friend from across street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buggies . A TINY FACE appeared at the Meister front window ? daughter Nancy , 2 . " She and Jennifer , who 's 4 , keep asking , ' Where 's Daddy ? " said Giltmier . " We 've told them Daddy 's hurt and wo n't be home for awhile . " Giltmier winced when someone opened the front storm door and it stuck . " He was going to fix that next . Right after the bathroom . I guess it will stay that way forever . Oh , God . "
