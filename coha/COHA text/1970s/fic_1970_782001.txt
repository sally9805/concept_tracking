 | The Ford was parked far back from the arena in a jumble of pickups and horsetrailers , far enough away that the lights and noise of rodeo scarcely intruded on the dusk . Soon she put Catch-22 on the seat again and sat watching the sky to the west . The sun had gone down and all the lower sky was yellow . While she watched , it became orange and then red and then a fainter red , and the color lingered on the rim of the plains until the whole sky was dark . She wore a gray dress and was bare-armed . It had been a hot afternoon for May , and the coolness of dusk felt good on her arms . Behind her , at the near end of the bleachers , a high school band broke into the National Anthem  --  it meant that the Grand Entry was in progress . The arena was full of horses and riders : rodeo had come again to Merkel , Texas . There were riding clubs , kids piled on ponies , pivot men unfurling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trousers , and nervous businessmen on palominos . The procession into the arena had been very noisy , but before the anthem ended , the sound of hoofs and the jingling of bits faded out and the grounds became so quiet that Patsy heard it when one of the young clarinetists squeaked his reed . Everyone but her was standing up and the knowledge made her fretful and a little ashamed of herself . The sport of rodeo did not interest Patsy at all  --  it interested her husband Jim . She herself had lumped it in her mind with cows , and cows did not interest her at all  --  not , at least , unless they were properly cooked . The fact that no cows were at hand was merely a lucky happenstance ; in that part of Texas cows might appear at any moment . The only animal immediately at hand was a fat sorrel horse . He was tied to the sideboards of a nearby trailer , close enough that Patsy could smell him . Aside from one fart , he had been very polite and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slapped him on the behind to make him move over , and he had refrained from kicking them . If similarly provoked , she felt sure she would have kicked them . Occasionally the horse swished his tail against the fender of the Ford . In the west a few very bright stars were out , though it was still not completely dark . She felt a little restless and was considering what she might do , when another cowboy walked by , a can of beer in one hand . He slapped the horse on the rump and the horse moved over . The cowboy burped , pitched down his beer can , unbuttoned  | his pants , and immediately began to relieve himself against the fender of the Ford . " Hey , " Patsy said , very startled . " Go piss on your own car ! " She was too surprised to sound very outraged , but she was no more surprised than the cowboy . He whirled around toward the trailer , liberally watering the whole area , horse included . " My god , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why did n't you speak up sooner ? " " Shock prevented me , " she said faintly , for she was shocked  --  the more so as the first surprise wore off . She could hear him pissing . " Lady , " he sighed , " I would stop . I just ai n't got the brakes . " " Oh , hell , " she said , flustered . The cowboy was silent until he finished and had buttoned up . He stood with his back to her a moment , apparently in thought , and then confidently hitched up his pants and turned toward the car . " Ed Boggs , " he said . " I guess I ought to apologize . " " I 'm Patsy Carpenter , " Patsy said , assuming that an introduction was taking place . Ed Boggs was clearly charmed . He leaned his elbows on the car door and peered in at her happily . His face was paunchy and he smelled of beer and starch and hair oil . " Never meant to mess up your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remorse . " I just kinda needed somethin ' to lean on there for a minute . Been puttin ' ' em down a little too fast this evenin ' . What I really want to do is ask you for a date to the dance . You look to me like you 've got a lot on the ball . " " Why , thanks , " Patsy said , smiling . Her cheeks colored . She could never help smiling when complimented . " I 'm married , though . " Mr. Boggs neither moved nor changed expression , and she assumed he had not understood . " I ca n't go to the dance with you , I mean . I 'm really married . " Ed Boggs was in no way discouraged . " Who ai n't ? " he said amiably . " My old lady 's married too . How about me gettin ' in and sittin ' down with you a minute to catch my breath ? " Patsy wanted very much to scoot toward the opposite door . Sitting beneath Mr. Boggs 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden object . He reached for the door handle , as if he were sure she would n't mind his getting in , but Patsy had locked the door and he did n't quite have the nerve to unlock it . " No , you ca n't get in , " she said . " You 're being a little rude . I was  | about to take a nap . Why do n't you go off and fill your bladder again ? " Her admirer attempted to take the rebuff in stride , but it was clearly not the sort of thing he was used to hearing from the lips of a woman . His paunches slowly shifted position and became a frown . " I ai n't gon na hug-dance with you if you talk to me like that , " he said , attempting to jest . " I ai n't out to rape you . I just want to sit down and rest a minute , maybe talk , you know . " Patsy was silent , hoping he would simply go away , but his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na get bucked off a bull tonight , " he said finally . " Here I am drunk as dawg shit , I 'll probably get my stupid ass stomped . Least you could do is be friendly . " At the thought of his own peril his tone grew slightly husky and his frown more melancholy . Patsy did n't melt with sympathy , but what he said did make it seem funny again . She had been about to get scared . " That 's a pity , " she said . " We all have problems . Now please listen  --  the point is that I do n't want you to get in and sit down . Just please go on away . If you 're planning to get stomped maybe you better not refill your bladder after all . " Ed Boggs drew back . He had reached his wits ' end . " What 's my goddam bladder got to do with it ? " he asked loudly . " That 's twice you done mentioned it . I just want to get in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good-lookin ' thing , you know , " he said , remembering that a compliment had got him his only smile . " No , " Patsy said , suddenly scared . He was terribly big and loud and she did n't know how to get rid of him . " You leave me completely alone ! Do n't you know better than to urinate on people 's cars ? It 's very rude . I 'm married , I told you . You ought to sober up instead of standing there trying to think of some way to seduce me . " She started crying and began to roll the car window up . At that Ed Boggs stepped away from the car . " Well , good snoozin ' , " he said angrily . " I 'm glad I ai n't the one that 's married to you . I got better sense than to screw a woman as wordy as you are , anyway . " Patsy stopped the window halfway up and they regarded each other for a moment through the deepening dusk . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patsy rolled her window back  | down and sat crying . Tears ran off her cheeks , into the hollows of her throat , down her chest . She could never find a Kleenex when she was crying and could only wipe the tears away with her fingers . Soon enough she stopped and felt more calm . She cried easily  --  absurdly easily , she felt . Half the things she cried about were merely silly . Her cheeks stung a little from the tears , but that soon stopped too and they felt cool . By the time she was through crying it had grown quite dark , so dark that she could barely see the sorrel horse . She wished Jim was there so she could tell him about Ed Boggs . To her left , across the parking lot , she could see the glow from the circle of lights above the open-air dance floor , and she tried for a moment to imagine what it would have been like to go to a dance with such a man . Crushing , she imagined , but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He might have been a good dancer . The remark about her being too talkative to sleep with rankled , though . It had obviously been sour grapes . Far to the northwest there were flickerings of lightning . The quietness was broken by a splashing near at hand , a steady splashing that carried with it an odor like wet hay . The patient sorrel horse was pissing too . Patsy looked and saw the arena lights faintly reflected in the spreading puddle . In an instant it lifted her spirits , and she wished again that her husband was there . It was just the kind of coincidence he loved  --  the kind that might happen in life but that could never be made to work in a novel . Jim had tried to write a novel the first year they were married and had made it over a hundred pages before he got diverted . When the splashing stopped , Patsy felt even fonder of the horse than she had originally . She decided to get out and pet him . He was good company , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she was opening the car door she thought she heard someone call her name . She saw no one and was puzzled , until she realized that her name had come over the public address system . The rodeo announcer had called her name . " WILL MRS . JAMES CARPENTER PLEASE COME TO THE JUDGES ' STAND . MRS . JAMES CARPENTER . " Scared , aflutter , she started off immediately and got two pickups away before she remembered her purse . She might need it . Jim was hurt , she knew . Her chest felt tight . She hurried back and got her 15  | purse , looked futilely for some Kleenex , and then turned and ran through the cars and trucks toward the arena . Perhaps he had tried to take a picture of a bull and been gored . She began to cry and a few strands of hair stuck to her wet cheek . As she came dashing out of the parking area , a roper who was warming up his roping mare came within a foot of running her down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush of its body past hers . She was out of breath and slowed to a walk . The roper whirled his mare and came back  --  he was unnerved and furious . " Let 's look where you 're goin ' , lady , " he said . " This ai n't no damn track meet . I coulda broke your neck . " " I 'm sorry , " Patsy said , sniffing and trying to get her breath . " I 'm afraid my husband 's been gored . If you could show me the way to the judges ' stand I 'll try and stay out of your way . " The roper was a thin young man , no older than Patsy . When he saw how pretty she was , and how distressed , he cooled off at once and got down from his horse to help . He held a rope in one hand and had a contestant 's number pinned to the back of his shirt . " I 'm Royce Jones , " he said . " Sorry I blew off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he get gored , bulldoggin ' ? " He spoke quite calmly , as if a goring were something that came to one occasionally , like a toothache , and his spurs jingled lightly as he walked beside her  --  a comforting masculine sound . " He 's probably just got raked alongside the ribs , " he added , to soothe her . " Always happens sooner or later , doggin ' . " " Oh , no , no , " Patsy said . " He 's a photographer , sort of . I do n't really know what 's happened to him . " Royce Jones grinned at her in the tolerant way men of experience grin at the folly of women . Distressed as she was , it annoyed her a little . " I doubt he 's gored , " he said . " Them steers would n't take after a photographer . He probably just wants you to bring him some flashbulbs . Ask the clown , he 'll know . That 's him there with the cop . Patsy saw the clown and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had mounted his mare and was already riding away . When he was halfway across the dusty road he stood up in his stirrups and turned and waved his rope at her , as if to acknowledge the thanks he had n't waited to receive .  | As Patsy turned back toward the arena she bumped smack into a little girl who had been racing along carrying a Sno-cone . The Sno-cone popped out of its cup and fell on Patsy 's foot , and the little girl looked at her angrily and neglected to hold the cup upright , so the lump of ice was followed by a stream of strawberry-colored water , part of which splashed on Patsy 's ankles . " Oh , damn , " she said . " Why ca n't anyone see me coming ? Do n't worry , I 'll buy you another one . I 've got some money right here . " " Okay , " the little girl said smugly . She knew the world owed her a new Sno-cone . " My name 's Fayette , " she added in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kick off , but most of it slid into her pump and began to melt beneath her instep and trickle between her toes . She dug in her purse but could find nothing smaller than a dollar . It made her feel a little desperate . Jim was somewhere , probably hurt , and the world was coming to an end amid an absolutely ridiculous mess involving her . Something in her rebelled against giving the little girl the whole dollar . She had taken a dislike to the little girl , and she hated to be exploited by anyone she disliked . She felt that her nerves were beginning to split and curl like the ends of her hair sometimes did , and she was on the point of raking things wildly out of her purse when she looked up and saw the clown approaching . He had on baggy overalls , a ridiculous derby hat , and red and white greasepaint . " I bet you 're Mrs. Carpenter , " he said in a quiet , agreeable voice . It was in complete contrast to his garish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , " Patsy said . " Do you have any change ? " But he had squatted down and was already holding out a dime to the little girl . " I seen your plight , " he said , glancing up at Patsy . Fayette was slightly awed by the clown , but not too awed to be practical . " They cost fifteen cents now , " she said . " Do you still have your skunk ? " Patsy would have liked to kick her , but the clown stood up and pulled a quarter out of his pocket . " If you got a nickel you can buy one for your little sister too , " he said . " I only got brothers . Did your skunk die ? " " No , it got stolen in Tucumcari . " The quarter grew bigger in her mind and Fayette said a perfunc-17  | tory thanks and rushed off to find her best girl friend and tell her about the skunk . " Thank you so much , " Patsy said . " I guess I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean on you for one second ? I 've got a Snocone in my shoe . " She handed him her purse , quickly emptied the water out of her pump , and , with one hand on his shoulder , slipped the shoe back on . " How did you know me ? " she asked . " Kind of an educated guess , " he said . " You do n't look like nobody else here . Your husband met with a little accident , not very serious . Let 's go see if he 's come to yet . " His voice was low and unworried and sure of itself , and it made her feel better . She snapped her purse shut and he took her firmly by the arm , his hand above her elbow , and they hurried into the bright dusty arena . Sand stuck to her wet shoe . A crowd of cowboys stood near the heavy wire fence , all of them looking healthy and very cheerful . They parted for the clown , and she saw Jim lying stretched out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaps . She had never seen him stretched so flat . His lower lip was split , and there was dirt in his blond hair and a raw skinned place on one temple . " Was he run over , or what ? What 's wrong with him ? " Patsy asked , tears starting in her eyes . It was terrifying to see her husband lying with his eyes closed amid a crowd of cowboys . " Just knocked out , " the clown said . " He was in a kind of fight , he 's not hurt bad . We 'll get him in an ambulance in a minute . " " But Jim never fights , " she said , kneeling and brushing awkwardly at the dirt in his hair . He was very blond and she could see the dirt against his scalp . " We do n't even know anybody here  --  who could he have wanted to fight ? " The clown squatted beside her and silently took off his bandanna and handed it to her . " He ai n't hurt bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have no hysterics . What happened was a couple of bronc riders beat him up . He snapped ' em at the wrong time , I guess . " When Patsy looked up , all she could see was the legs of cowboys , long legs in blue Levi 's , and large hands with the thumbs hooked in the pockets of the Levi's. 18  | " Where is the ambulance ? " she asked . " I wo n't be hysterical , but ca n't it come on ? " " Oh , it 's right out there , " the clown said . " Its the driver we ca n't locate . He went off with some woman and took his keys with him . " Pete 's my name , " he added . " But that 's awful , " she said . " That 's awful . " Jim 's face seemed waxen to her . She had an urge to feel his pulse but was afraid to for fear she would n't be able to find it . The clown 's hair was sandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the fact that he seemed genuinely unworried kept her from breaking down completely . Then , to her relief , there was the sound of a motor , and a white ambulance spun into the arena , cut sharply their way , and skidded through the knot of cowboys , almost to Jim 's feet . It scared Patsy terribly , but the cowboys jumped gracefully out of the way and seemed amused at the driver 's recklessness . Suddenly several of them converged on Jim . Pete helped her up , and in a moment Jim was in the ambulance and Pete was helping her in after him . When she looked around to thank him all the cowboys were standing behind him , arranged like so many wooden-faced sculptures , all of them staring at her . It embarrassed her , and she blushed . " Have you to town in no time , ma'am , " the driver said . Patsy turned and saw that he too was watching her . He was a balding man , with such hair as he had slicked down . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she said , turning back to Pete . " I do n't know what to do . " " No , got to work , " he said . " He 'll come to in a minute . " He nodded kindly as he shut the ambulance doors . She realized then that she had his bandanna in her hand , but it was too late to give it back . The ambulance was already spinning around in the soft dirt , and a cloud of dust hid the clown and the cowboys . " We 're off , " the driver said cheerfully , as if it were a race . The ambulance came out of its curve and almost plowed into two black Shetland ponies that had wandered into the entranceway to the arena . " Shit-toody , " the driver said , braking hard . " Get them goddamn ponies out of the way , " he yelled , leaning out of the window . " I got a hurt man in here . " A cowboy ran up and yanked the little ponies unceremoniously aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to brake abruptly again when confronted with the milling crowd of children and horses and men . The starting and stopping seemed to wake Jim up . He blinked and made a restless movement . " He ai n't hurt , he 's already movin ' , " the driver said , looking back again . They passed out of the rodeo grounds , accelerated down a short dirt road , and lurched onto a highway . The rodeo pens were three miles outside the town . " Nothin ' to worry about , " the driver said , speeding into a curve . He kept looking back at Patsy , with more interest than he seemed to be able to muster for the road . She could see the lights of the little town , bright in the darkness , but the ambulance was going so fast it seemed to her they might not be able to stop even if they got there safely . Jim suddenly raised up on his elbow . " Got to vomit , " he said . " Get the pan , get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just in time . The sharp smell of the vomit made her feel nauseated herself . " I hope you got my cameras , " Jim said when he was finished and lying back . " I feel bad . " " Oh , I did n't , " Patsy said . She started to explain , but her voice broke on the first word and she began to cry again . Jim had wiped his mouth on the clown 's bandanna and it seemed that for the hundredth time in an hour she had nothing to cry into but her bare hands . Jim was white around the mouth , whether from weakness or from anger about the cameras she could n't tell . As they flashed into the little town she lifted her husband 's arm and wiped her face on his blue shirt sleeve . He cupped his hand behind her neck a moment affectionately , and she felt relieved . A few street lights were on and some frazzled-looking rodeo flags were strung between the streetlight poles . The ambulance driver began to grow irritable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run . " Ai n't hurt a goddamn bit , " he muttered . " I knew it . Made a trip for nothin ' and was interrupted besides . " " Oh , please be quiet , " Patsy said . " He is hurt . We 'll pay you for your trouble . " I know your kind , " she added melodramatically , because the driver glanced back at her again . " I wish you 'd got the cameras , " Jim said . They squealed to a stop behind a small dingy-looking brick hospital with a big television antenna on the roof and a swarm of moths 20  | and insects around the yellow light bulb that lit the back door . Jim gamely sat up , but he did n't look mobile . The driver honked impatiently and they all sat waiting for attendants to run out with stretchers . None came.The driver sighed and stretched his arm across the back of the seat . He seemed content to wait , since he was there , and turned on the radio . A hillbilly song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my baby 's not in town tonight , This ole town just do n't seem right , Even my old friends do n't seem the same to me Well my baby 's not in town tonight , These ole lights do n't shine so bright , And I 'm cryin ' tears till I ca n't hard-ly see " Can you walk if I help you ? " she asked Jim . " I do n't think there 's anybody in there , but maybe we can at least find you a bed . " " Oh , there 's somebody in there , most likely , " the driver said , waxing friendly . He looked back at her with robust admiration . " I 'll help you drag him in , ma'am , " he offered . He got out and opened the ambulance doors and the two of them helped Jim ease to the ground . Once on his feet , he waved them off and wobbled unsteadily toward the hospital , leaving Patsy to pay the driver . He stood watching her , scratching his stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said acidly . " I hope you can pick up where you left off , approximately at least . " The driver , nothing abashed , took out an old billfold and stuffed the money in it . " Ai n't too likely , ma'am , " he said . " Somebody else probably done already has , if I know that gal . Besides , I 'll have to be hauling in them stomped-up bull riders before long . Such is the times . Glad to help you out , ma'am . " His complacency and the way he kept calling her ma'am were almost too much . " Oh , I 'd like to kick you , " she said hotly . The driver was amazed , and silenced for a moment . " You sure you ai n't crazy ? " he asked after a pause , unable to arrive at any other explanation . " I do n't like being called ma'am , " she said and walked away . The driver continued to scratch his stomach , but a little less happily . 21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a couch with his eyes shut . " No one 's here , " he said , but no sooner had he said it than a fat implacably jolly nurse walked in and stood with her hands on her hips looking at Jim . She was as rouged as any harlot , but no one could have looked less like a whore . " I see the bloodshed 's begun , " she said . " Doctor 'll be out in a minute . He 's pumpin ' out a kid who had himself some rat poison for supper . It 's a wonder to me any of us survive . " She gave Patsy a card to fill out , and they sat alone in the empty waiting room for twenty-five minutes waiting for the doctor to come . The bright overhead light was so piercing that Jim had to keep his eyes closed . Patsy hunted through his billfold and found their insurance card . The beige leatherette couch they sat on seemed to her the ugliest piece of furniture she had ever seen . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He had a way of being single-minded , even when in pain . " That 's nine hundred dollars gone if somebody steals them . Besides , they had pictures in them . " " I just did n't see them . I had pictures in me too  --  pictures of you dying and me being left at the mercy of about a thousand stupid cowboys . Maybe the clown took care of them . He was the only nice person there . " But she felt guilty , anyway , for not having more presence of mind . Soon a frail-looking doctor with a black hearing aid came in and led Jim off to be X-rayed , and she sat alone in the waiting room , fidgeting uselessly about the cameras . Jim had only been working at photography three months and she had difficulty taking it seriously . His decision to photograph rodeos seemed quite nonsensical to her . She was always unable to take his work seriously enough at the time when he was most intense about it ; by the time she became enthused about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bored with it and ripe for a new pursuit . To escape the brightness of the waiting room she walked out into the front yard of the hospital . The grass was dry and crackly already , though it was not yet summer . She walked around the side of the building to the back , away from the street lights , and felt better at once . The depth and sweep of the sky was a relief after the tiny room , and the sky was sown with uncountable stars . Her hair was mussed ; she took a comb out of her purse and stood combing it , her 22  | legs spread and her head bent back over one shoulder . Her hair was black and she wore it middling length , just long enough that it touched her shoulders . She felt refreshed and combed vigorously , looking straight up into the Milky Way . It seemed very odd to her that anyone , even a cowboy , would want to hit Jim . He was mild-tempered and agreeable , and to her knowledge no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital , combing more leisurely , and saw a car filled with teenagers race down the empty street . It was an old two-tone Buick with no muffler . There were eight or ten kids in it , boys and girls all mashed together , yelling and laughing and waving their arms out the windows . As they passed the hospital a boy pitched an empty beer can high in the air . It rang when it hit the pavement , bounced into the center of the street , and spun around a few times before it stopped . The sound of the car gradually faded and the silence of the empty summer town was complete again . When she went back inside , the fat red-cheeked nurse was sitting at the desk clicking her tongue over a coverless movie magazine that seemed to be several years old . " Pore little Debbie , " she said . " Ca n't tell a no-good when she sees one , can she , honey ? We 've about got your hubby patched up . " Patsy felt defenseless . The slovenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of character would kick a jolly nurse . It irked her to be called honey , and it irked her more to hear Jim referred to as her hubby . It was on the tip of her tongue to say something very complimentary about Elizabeth Taylor , but before she could think of anything she glanced up and saw that the fat nurse was looking at the pictures with affection brimming in her face . Her voice had dropped with sadness when she said , " pore little Debbie , " and she was studying the pictures with as much fondness as she might have bestowed on a family scrapbook . " I 'm sure it was hard on her , " she said , choked for a moment , with a desire to be kind to the nurse . " ' Course Liz ai n't had no easy life either , " the nurse went on . " She was as sweet a little thing as there ever was when she was young . Growed up too fast , I guess , and let all them bright lights and them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , went with my sister and her family . We went to Disneyland and had us quite a time . You-all got any little ones ? " 23  | " Not yet , " Patsy said . It was a question she disliked being asked . " Well , you ought to . Lord bless us , they 're what 's worth living for . ' Course I never married myself , but my sister has six and I love every one of ' em . Liz has been a good mother , seems like , but adult'ry 's adult'ry , do n't matter who does it . When you carry on like that you 've got to pay . Thank goodness I 've got a clean conscience , even if I do n't have much else . " " Did they X-ray my husband yet ? " Patsy asked , suddenly remembering Jim . " Oh , they X-rayed him all right , " the nurse said . " I do n't know what showed up . All them X rays look alike to me . " She rattled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat steadier . He had a badly swollen lip and a bandage on his forehead . Patsy went over and put her arm around him a little awkwardly . She had never been able to be gracefully affectionate in public . " The doctor 's been telling me rodeo stories , " Jim said . " I must be lucky . I do n't even have a concussion . " " Sonny , you would n't know the half of it , " the nurse said cheerfully . " I 've been a night nurse twenty-four years and you would n't believe the sights I 've seen , specially after these rodeos . They brought in a boy one time with a hatchet stuck in his skull  --  never lived the night . And nine times out of ten it 's all to do with women . " It was not until they were out the door , standing on the front lawn of the hospital , that they realized they had no way back to the rodeo grounds . " It 's unreal , " Patsy said . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 're not so wrong , " Jim said mildly . " Just inconvenient . Who would have thought those crazy bronc riders would hit me ? " " I would have thought it . I 'll believe anything about cowboys . A bull rider tried to seduce me too . I did n't get a chance to tell you sooner . He peed on our car and then tried to seduce me . " Jim seemed scarcely to hear . He wandered aimlessly and a little woozily across the hospital lawn . " They did n't even bawl me out or give me warning , " he said . " I would have quit if they had . I took two pictures , and a big one got up and knocked me loop-legged . I 'm still loop-legged , I guess . " " Oh , listen to my problems , " Patsy said , relieved that he could  | talk again . " If you have to indulge in pity , pity me . There I was , about to be raped and pillaged in a parking lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened I 'd be loop-legged too , believe me . " " I wonder if there 's a taxi . " " Of course not . What would a taxi be doing out in the wilderness ? We 'll have to wait two days for a bus , or else walk . What about my gallant stand for chastity ? " " It sounds like you made it up , " Jim said . " Why would anyone want to pee on our car ? " She thought he was going to say , " Why would anyone want to seduce you , " and was relieved . " I think he chose the car more or less at random , " she said . " Why would anyone want to knock you loop-legged ? These people are crazy , that 's why . Is n't there anything besides rodeo you could take pictures of ? I do n't like you getting beat up and I do n't want to sit around getting raped and pillaged just so you can become a famous photographer . Why not take pictures of gypsies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " Jim was silent , looking down the empty street . He did n't enjoy joking about his profession , whatever his profession was at the time , and Patsy knew it ; but she kept thinking that if she could make the right sort of joke , in the right tone , he might relax about it and then everything would be a lot more fun . But demons got in her and she never made the right sort of joke or found the right tone . " The bull rider 's name was Boggs , " she said . " He breathed on me . If my fair white body is going to be sacrificed to your ambition the least you could do is take me to Europe . Why must I be sacrificed in Merkel , Texas ? " It did n't lift his spirits , so with a wriggle of her slim shoulders she dropped it and went over and hugged him , her face against his throat . He had his hands in his pockets and she shyly pulled one out and held it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . Then they heard the thin noise of a siren in the distance and saw , far down the straight highway , the red revolving light on top of the ambulance . " Aha , " Jim said . " Here comes us a ride . " 25  | " No , " Patsy said firmly . " That 's not our ride . I refuse to ride with that man . " " Why ? He surely did n't try to seduce you , did he ? " " No . " " Then why not ? " " Well , because I threatened to kick him , " she admitted . " I 'm the kind of girl who sometimes threatens people . " " You never threatened to kick me , " Jim said , frankly astonished . " You 're nicer than him . He just prompted me to threaten him , never mind why . " " I do n't intend to pass up a ride just because you were rude , " Jim said . " I 'm about to collapse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business saying whatever you said . " The ambulance shrieked into town and skidded to a stop on the gravel driveway . Patsy did n't want to look . She had the horrid conviction that Ed Boggs had indeed been stomped by a bull . She would have to watch him carried into the hospital , his entrails spilling out . Instead , a young cowboy in black chaps emerged from the ambulance and limped inside , holding one of his shoulders . Jim walked over to the ambulance and she followed timidly . " Sure , sure , " the driver said , waving them in . " I got your cameras for you . Pete Tatum gathered ' em up . Just keep between me and your missus , is all I ask . She 's a little on the violent side , ai n't she ? " He was lighting the stub of a cigar and seemed not to expect an answer . Jim got in the middle and Patsy sat by the window . In a moment they were speeding back past the street lights , toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car door . As they gained speed the rush of air cooled her armpit and blew through her dress , across her chest . The lightning to the northwest had grown heavier ; when it flashed they saw the dark shape of a cloud . The driver seemed to be making an effort to be polite and Patsy softened toward him . " I 'm sorry I said what I did , " she said . " I was a bit overwrought . Did you say the clown 's name was Pete ? He told me but I 'd forgotten . " " Pete Tatum . Knowed him for years . Only reason Pete bothers with this little show is because his brother 's a big man in the rodeo association here . He works them big professional shows . Santa Rosa and shows like that . "  | " It was awfully nice of him to take care of the cameras , " Jim said . " Thank him for us in case we miss him . " Ahead , off the road , they saw the glow of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The driver turned onto the dirt road and they were soon back inside the rodeo grounds . " This 'll be fine , " Jim said . " Our car 's right here . " " Okay . Watch out for your missus now . Do n't let her kick none of these pore cowboys . Most of them get kicked enough as it is . " " I 'd advise you not to run that into the ground , " Patsy said . " I might make good on it yet . " The driver grinned at her engagingly . " I was teasin ' , " he said . " Be a pleasure to be kicked by a pretty young wench like yourself . See you-all next time . " He tooted his horn lightly with the heel of his hand and moved the ambulance expertly through the mob of men and women and children who were leaving the stands . " You see , " Patsy said . " He keeps calling me things . Could I be accurately described as a wench ? " Jim was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took his hand and they walked through the swirl of people toward the Ford . The horses and cars and departing pickups kept the sandy roadway stirred up , so that the dust rose to their waists and made it seem like they were walking through a sandy mist . Car lights shone red through the sand , and whenever a horse crossed the road in front of a car the lights threw huge wavering shadows against the dust . " I hope you do n't mind driving , " Jim said . " I still feel dizzy . " The sorrel was no longer tied next to the Ford , and the trailer he had been tied to was gone . Jim went wearily around the car . Patsy stood for a moment by the door on the driver 's side trying to locate her car keys by the little door light . Finally she jiggled her purse and located them by the jingle . " Let 's sit until the traffic thins out a little , " she said . Jim was quite agreeable . He slumped silently against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ignition his eyes were closed , and very soon he was asleep . It annoyed her and dropped her spirits a little , even though she knew his head must hurt . She wanted to talk , and having him so soon asleep made her feel lonely , as it often did . Jim could go to sleep quicker than anyone she had ever known . He claimed he had always been able to , but she sometimes felt it was 27  | an escape technique he had developed for occasions when he did n't want to talk to her . She would have liked to scoot over by him , but there was a clutter of photographic paraphernalia in the front seat and she had to content herself with putting a hand on his shoulder . Over the way , the dance she had been invited to was in progress . As the cars drove out and the grounds grew quiet she began to hear the sounds of the dancing , a yell now and then , the scraping of feet on concrete , and , over that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she only heard the ring of the steel guitars , but as the grounds emptied , mournful snatches of lyric filtered through : Keep those cards ' n ' letters comin ' in-uh-in , honey , Tell me that you love me time ' n ' time ugin-uh-in , honey ; It 's many a mile from Memphis to Berlin-uh-in , honey , So keep those cards ' n ' letters comin ' innn . . . . Patsy kept time with her fingertips . When the song ended she started the Ford and drove through the almost empty grounds , squashing several beer cans but no bottles that she noticed . There was a very small trailer parked to the left of the exit gate , with a donkey tied to the fence nearby . As she turned to go through the gate her headlights swept across the front of the trailer . A man with no shirt on sat on the tiny steps of the trailer wiping his face with a towel . He looked up when she passed and to her surprise called her name . She braked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and came to the car , the towel slung over one shoulder . " Thought that was you , " he said , and she realized it was the clown . He bent and peered in at her solemnly and looked past her at Jim . " He 's just asleep , " she said . " He 's fine . I 'm ashamed of myself for being so flustered . " But she felt embarrassed and oddly flustered again and did n't know whether to look at him or not . He seemed lankier than he had seemed in his clowning apparel . He was balding too . The hair that was so curly on the sides of his head was almost gone on the top . " We 're very grateful about the cameras , " she said . A girl had come to the door of the trailer house and stood just inside the screen , her body a dark shadow . " Well , glad he was n't hurt , " Pete said . " Maybe sometime I 'll get  | to meet him when he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can tell him who not to take pictures of . " " Oh , we wo n't be coming back here , " she said . " We were in Dallas and heard about this rodeo and drove out . We 're going to lots more , though  --  my husband wants to do a book of pictures about them . I 'm sure we 'll see you again . " " Hope so , " Pete said , stepping back . He was sawing the towel thoughtfully against the back of his neck . Patsy never quite knew how to get out of conversations ; she gave a little nod , raced her motor a little , and let the clutch out too quickly . The Ford jerked forward and almost died . In a moment she regained control and was out the gate . A cowboy was leading three horses down the middle of the dirt road that led to the highway , but as she approached he obligingly moved them over and waved at her cheerfully , his hands full of bridle reins . When she turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther down in the seat , his head still against the car door . Straining , Patsy reached across him and locked it . The lightning had come close enough that she could see it flickering in her rearview mirror , but it seemed a dry kind of lightning , appropriate to the country . Ahead on the straight highway were five or six sets of red taillights , cars going back to town . Patsy drove slowly , in no hurry . She followed the taillights into the town and stopped at both lights . The cars that had been ahead of her had all disappeared , absorbed by the town . Except for a deputy 's car parked in the driveway of a filling station , hers was the only vehicle in sight . The deputy was sitting with his car door open . He had taken one boot off , and the sock too , and was contemplating his bare foot with an expression of gloom . He held a pocketknife in his hand , one blade open , as if perhaps he meant to perform an amputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have liked Jim to take a picture of , though no doubt the deputy would have resented it . Probably the man had ingrown toenails from wearing such sharptoed boots . When the light turned green she went on , past a block of darkened grocery stores and laundries , still driving slowly and enjoying the almost pristine emptiness of the little town . Except for herself , the deputy , and one lank brown dog , the emptiness was absolute . Soon she left the town behind and turned onto the Interstate . On the 29  | broad highway she could not help driving fast . There was no one on the road but herself and the trucks of the night , the huge trucks with squares of red taillights that lumber nightly over the country , from the South to Los Angeles and from Los Angeles to the South . The trucks blinked their eyes when she passed them , purring and snorting like great nocturnal animals . She held to the left until she had passed half a dozen and was ahead of all that were in sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was eighty-five . The darkness , the speed , the straining pulse of the car , and the rush of cool air in the window were keenly satisfying to her , as satisfying as the taste of the Hershey bar had been , and as brief , for the motel where they were staying was in Abilene , less than a dozen miles away . She would have liked another fifty miles to drive  --  the road all to herself and the wind blowing her hair and cooling her arms . She swerved slightly from time to time to avoid the flattened corpse of some possum or coon or armadillo , and much too soon she was among the lights and filling stations of Abilene . It was irritating to have to slow down when she was avid for more driving ; she stamped the brake with annoyance at the first light off the freeway . Their motel was called The Old Homestead . Its office was done in imitation logs , with a squirrel rifle hung over the door to complete the effect . She circled the office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motor at the door of their room , yawning and stretching her arms back over her head as far as she could . The moment she stopped she was glad she had no farther to go . She considered Jim with a mixture of affection and petulance , and gathered up her purse and Catch-22 and his precious cameras , only to have to set them all down at the door of the room in order to find her key . She found it , took the stuff in and dumped it on the bed , got a glass of water , swished some around in her mouth when she was through drinking , and walked back out and across the bare courtyard to stand on the concrete edge of the swimming pool a minute , staring at the greenish shimmer of the water . She yawned and leaned backward , her hair dangling . The stars were so much brighter than any stars they ever saw in Houston , where they lived . Once again she yawned , and she reached inside the armpit of her dress to scratch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the Ford to begin the awkward but familiar task of getting her husband awake enough to go to bed .  | SONNY SHANKS DREW THE LAST BULL of the evening ? a large white-eyed brindle bull . As soon as it humped out of the chute the crowd began to cheer . Usually by the last bull of the evening the crowd would have become blase , bored with danger and tired of cheering . But Sonny Shanks was the king of the sport  --  the World 's Champion Cowboy  --  and for him they cheered eagerly , even before they saw the ride . The brindle bull humped straight ahead , swinging strings of slobber left and right and kicking his hind legs high every second jump . He did n't twist or whirl , and Shanks rode him so confidently that to the crowd it seemed almost as if the ride were taking place in slow motion . Pete had placed himself far back , by one of his barrels . He knew the brindle bull as well as Sonny did , and he was n't worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed with the bull two more jumps and then left them . He went off his feet when he hit but was up in a second . The bull whirled back toward him dipping a horn , but at that moment Pete yelled and came into his line of vision waving his arms . Confused , the bull turned toward Pete , paused , made a short grunting dash at him , and when Pete sprinted aside , paused again , his head up and a string of clear slobber hanging from his lip . The crowd , knowing that the show was over , stood up and began to leave the stands . Pete stood still a few seconds letting the bull look at him . He was a good-tempered bull , as rodeo stock went , a massive animal with the horns of a Brahma and a hide that showed every breed from Angus to Jersey . When he had studied Pete , he dipped his horn at him once more , snorted , and trotted heavily off toward the stockpens , the cowbell roped beneath his belly jangling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rope came loose and Pete walked over and picked it up . Shanks had not gone to the chutes but stood near the center of the arena probing in his mouth with one finger . " Bite your tongue ? " Pete asked in passing . Shanks shook his head . " Feels like I jarred a fillin ' out , " he said .  | " Well , you done fair , " Pete said , handing him the bell rope . " You can afford a new filling . " Shanks 's curly black hair fell over his forehead . He gave Pete a cool grin . " It beats clownin ' , " he said . " Reckon that rookie 'll live ? " Pete walked on toward the chutes and did n't answer . He felt low enough about the rookie , and an argument with Sonny would not improve his mood . The rookie , a kid from Duncan , Oklahoma , had got a hand hung in his rope , and the bull had been a twister , almost impossible to get close to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake by moving at the wrong time , as Pete was trying to take the bull away . He had been kicked hard and was in the hospital with some broken ribs and a smashed collarbone . Compared to what might have happened , the injuries were minor , but knowledge of what might have happened was never any help to Pete . He took every such accident to bed with him , and had for years . He found Boots sitting on the steps of the trailer waiting for him . She had seen the accident and knew exactly what mood he would be in , and she was chewing her nails . " That 's where I like to find you , " he said . Boots stood up and hugged him silently and then went to the rear of the trailer and talked to Hercules , the tiny donkey , while Pete went inside to clean up . A small dachshund named Jumbo had been sleeping under the trailer steps . He was jealous of the donkey and came over and nosed her ankle possessively . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroking the donkey 's silky nostrils . " How 'd you do ? " Pete called . " Sixth , " Boots said . She was a barrel racer . " That 's not so bad ? not at the Santa Rosa . " Pete came out of the trailer and stood on the steps looking down at her . He had washed his face and found a clean gray work shirt . He unbuttoned his britches to tuck his shirttail in , then turned his cuffs back almost to his elbows . He whistled when he was sad , and he was whistling . " Let 's go honky-tonk , " he said . Boots had her back to him . All he could see was her white bleached-blond hair . " Maybe sometime I 'll win a first , " she said . Barrel racing was her passion . Pete stepped down and embraced her and they kissed .  | Boots was eager and vigorous , yearning as she did every time they touched to prove with her young mouth , or her young self , that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever . Pete lacked a year being twice her age . Her mouth moved on his , fresh and uncertain , trying to kiss the kiss that would make him sure of her . " You gon na drive or am I gon na drive ? " he asked when they stopped kissing . " Me , " she said . They got into her Thunderbird and cut at once into the stream of traffic that was feeding out of the grounds . No sooner were they on the highway than Boots passed three cars . " Do n't worry about it so , " she said . " The bull might have killed him if you had n't been there . " " Sugar , hush , " Pete said . " One thing you have got to learn is that you ca n't cheer me up by trying to cheer me up . Try not to plow into no trucks , if you do n't mind . I 'd like to survive to drink the matter off . " But no cautions reached Boots when the wheel was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she got into a clear stretch , ; ahead of the traffic , she put the Thunderbird up to ninety , her white hair whipping about her face . Pete watched the fence posts and the culverts and the road signs flash by , out of the darkness a second , into the darkness in another second . He almost never drove without pulling his horsetrailer , and high speed worried him unless something else was worrying him so much that he was indifferent to speed . But fast driving made Boots feel bold ; at the wheel she had absolute trust in herself . When the barrel racing was over she had changed from boots to sandals , and she wiggled her toes a little and kept the footfeed down . " Hope there ai n't no livestock wandering around loose tonight , " Pete said wryly . " If you was to hit a cow , there would n't be a hamburger left of either us or her . " " I want to get there ahead of the crowd , " Boots said . " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . It 's not your fault if people ride bulls . Think of all the people you 've kept from getting hurt . " Her nose was round and a little too short and when she tried to cheer somebody up she tried hard . Pete reached a hand across the gap between the seats and began to rub her neck . Her swirling hair 33  | tickled his fingers . He rubbed high up , behind her ears . " See , we 're early , " she said . The honky-tonk was called The Hole in the Bucket and was located just across the line in a wet county . Twenty or thirty cars and a few pickups were parked in front when they got there . It was a long one-story frame building , set by the highway in a clearing in the brush , with a flashing neon sign to slow people down . In spite of Boots a lot of the rodeo crowd was already there , but they found a booth in the back and ordered beer . There were booths , a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squat jukebox . The barmaids wore Levi 's and satin shirts . Pete went over and fed a dollar into the jukebox and , in time , fed another and , in time , another , and Boots tapped her fingers on the beer bottles and matched him beer for beer , though she would much rather have danced . But Pete only danced when he was drunk , and that took time . Long before Pete felt the beer , Boots was high on it and talking loudly . She felt lightheaded and light-bodied and wanted all sorts of things from moment to moment : to dance , to have more beer , to kiss Pete and have him kiss her . The room was gray-blue with cigarette smoke and the neon of the jukebox ; it was loud with shuffling feet and giggles and curses , some happy , some angry . Pete dropped beneath his melancholy into a state of calm , now and then losing himself for a moment in one of Boots 's hopeful beery kisses , now watching the shuffling dancers or the barmaids with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sonny , " Boots said . " The bastard . I guess he 's a bastard . You hate him , do n't you ? " " We ai n't chums , " Pete said . " I do n't like him , either , " Boots declared loyally . " Even if you wo n't tell me why you hate him . " " I doubt he 's in love with us , either , " Pete said , amused . " I know you had a fight on the bridge , " Boots said . " Everybody knows that . It 's the one thing I know . " It was the one thing that everyone in rodeo knew : that Pete and Sonny had had a fist fight on the bridge above the Rio Grande , in El Paso . It had been eight years since the fight . No one in rodeo had seen it , but no one in rodeo was without an opinion as to how it had started and who won .  | Pete kissed her lightly . " Tell you one secret about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a present that night . Only thing he ever gave me . What it was was a dirty movie . " Boots could not have been more impressed . She stopped kissing to think about it . " A real one ? " she asked . " I did n't know you could buy them . What did you do with it ? " " Threw it into the Rio Grande , " Pete said . " That was about when the fight started . " Boots could not get over it . None of the legends that had grown up around the fight included a dirty movie . " What did people do in it ? " she asked . " Oh , a little of this and a little of that . " The woman Shanks was dancing with was a tall brunette , fairly drunk . They were an easy couple to follow because the woman was wearing a white dress and almost all of the other women there wore cowgirl clothes . Shanks was dancing very Western , with lots of bending and swooping ; occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrieked and clasped his neck , but he always brought her up easily . When the number ended he spotted Boots and Pete and led the woman over to their booth . " You children are up late , " he said , grinning at Boots . " A young thing like you needs lots of sleep , honey . " " I 'm not so young , " Boots said , annoyed . " Sit down , since you 're here , " Pete said . Shanks was willing but the woman pulled on his arm . " Let 's go on , " she said . " We can take some beer with us . I want to get out of here before Monroe comes in . " " Piss on Monroe , " Shanks said , still smiling at Boots . " I 've survived a bronc and a bull tonight , why 'd I worry about Monroe ? " " It 's me that 's worrying , " the woman said . " I got to live with him , do n't I ? " She kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looks like I got to choose between company an ' adultery , " he said . " See you boys and girls tomorrow . " The woman hurried toward the door and Shanks followed , picking his way lightly between the crowded tables . At one table he stopped and lifted a cowboy 's hat , tried it on , and returned it to its owner 's head . The cowboy did n't even notice . He was drunkenly trying to explain to his wife that he was n't drunk . 35  | " The hell you are n't , " his wife said , crying . Her chin was propped on one hand and tears ran down her arm . " You 're drunk as a bastard and all our kids right out there in the car asleep . " Shanks tilted the man 's hat at a slightly jauntier angle than it had been and followed his date out the door . " I thought his rich girl friend lived around here , " Boots said . " Eleanor Guthrie . What 's he doing fiddling around with people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete said . She put her head against his neck , and he held her and before long she was asleep . When she slept she looked even younger than she was , sixteen rather than nineteen , and watching her sleep made Pete feel the more guilty about her , but also the more strongly drawn to her . He could not let her go , not after having taken her . He cradled her against his chest , motioned to the waitress , and listened to the jukebox through two more slow beers . When he finished and tried to ease Boots out of the booth she came half awake and with him guiding her stumbled out to the car . The wind had come up , with thunder behind it in the west . Some rain was on its way , close enough that Pete could smell it on the wind . In the dry country it smelled good . After he folded Boots into the Thunderbird he discovered that she had the keys in her pocket and he had an awkward time digging them out of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make love and giggled a little and kept squeezing his hand against her in acquiescence , though she was limp and sleepy . He got the keys finally and started back toward the town of Vernon . He had driven only two or three miles when he saw Shanks 's hearse , dark inside and parked well out on the level shoulder . For years Shanks had driven Cadillac hearses  --  they were an essential part of his legend . The hearses were white and he always had three sets of bulls ' horns painted in gold on each one : a set on each door and one on the top , so people in airplanes would know it was him , he said . On occasions when he had to fly to make a rodeo he would hire a needy rookie to drive the hearse to him . That 's one place Monroe wo n't never think to look , Pete said to himself . As he passed the hearse he honked as loud as he could . Boots did not even stir . She slept with her head thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small light bosom barely stirring the  | satiny rodeo shirt as she breathed . Pete glanced at her now and then and settled it with himself definitely , no backing out , that the next day he would wake her early and ask her how soon she wanted to he married . Beyond Electra , on the straight highway leading to Vernon , he ran into the heavy early-summer rain , and he held his arm out the window until his hand and arm were wet . All tension had left him and he felt a little too tired . He wiped his face with his wet hand to clear his head . There was n't much traffic on the road , but he had gone to sleep at the wheel a number of times in his life and was taking no chances . He took his time on the slick pavement and in twenty minutes swished into Vernon and put his sleeping sweetheart safely to bed . THOUGH HE KNEW it was probably Pete who honked , Sonny sat up when he heard the horn . Pete was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amours , but in this instance he had n't been disturbed and was quite ready to sit up . The woman , whose name was May , lay asleep on the low bed , her mouth open , her legs open , everything open except her eyes . She had had more beer and more excitement than she was accustomed to , and had quickly spread out into slumber . Sonny had had no beer and only a most modest amount of excitement and was n't sleepy at all . In The Hole in the Bucket , amid a crowd of cowgirls , May had looked better than she looked asleep , and he wished he had had the good sense to leave her strictly to Monroe . " Hey , sweetheart , " he said , shaking her foot . " Wake up and tell me where you live . Time you was getting home to your regular feller . " May mumbled something in a complimentary tone , but it was n't her address , so Shanks pulled his Levi 's up and climbed over in the driver 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun to sprinkle . He turned the hearse around and drove slowly back to The Hole in the Bucket . A red Pontiac convertible was parked directly under the neon sign , and the top was down . Sonny parked the hearse beside the car and went around and opened the rear doors . His conquest 37  | was sleeping soundly , nothing on but her bra and a four-dollar bracelet . He reached in and eased her out , bare-assed and limp , and plopped her quickly in the back seat of the Pontiac . There was a bridle and a six-pack of Pearl beer on the seat but he managed to shove them onto the floorboards . He quickly crawled into the hearse and gathered up what he could find of May 's clothes and took them back and piled them on top of her . She had begun to wake up and was mumbling vague complaints . " What the hell  --  Monroe ? " she said , looking at the Pontiac in sleepy astonishment . The neon sign flashed green and lit her body for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honey , " he said . " Just stay there , one 's comin ' . " Before she had her eyes open good he was in the hearse and gone . In a few miles the rain met him , soft and slow at first and then a little heavier . He had taken a couple of pills after his ride and felt good . About halfway back to Vernon he saw a car stopped on the shoulder of the road . A young man and his girl were both out in the rain trying to change a tire . The girl was holding a flashlight and looked to be pretty  --  slim and black-headed and already soaked . Her boy was straining over his tire tool . Shanks swished on up the highway for half a mile , letting the hearse gradually lose momentum , and then he turned and went back . There was no point in not helping a man who had a pretty girl . He eased the hearse onto the slick shoulder and up behind their car , an old green Ford that looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he stopped the hearse he bent over the back seat and dug around in the litter in the back until he found an ivory-handled umbrella he had stolen from a TV producer in L.A. The young man was having trouble getting his lugs unscrewed . He had three off and in the hubcap , which was rapidly filling with water , but the last two lugs were n't budging . " Hi , boys and girls , " Sonny said , sloshing up to them . He was barefooted . " Let 's take shelter under here , " he said , opening the umbrella . " Thanks , but there 's not much need now , " Patsy said . Water dripped off her hair , her green dress was soaked , her bra sodden , and her bra straps clearly visible through the thin wet dress . She was annoyed and , since Sonny had appeared , embarrassed as well .  | Jim slipped in his effort to wrench loose a lug , and went down on one knee in the mud . " Shit , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lug wrench , would you , mister ? I ca n't get enough leverage with this miserable thing . " It was a short lug wrench , of the sort that doubled as a jack handle . The footing was getting worse and worse and he could not keep the wrench on the lugs . " It 'd take a week to find mine , " Sonny said . " Let me have a try . I 'm fresh and you 're done exasperated . " He grinned and handed the umbrella to Patsy . Jim gladly yielded the wrench . It had only been raining a few minutes and yet his pants and shirt were already smeared with mud . Shanks squatted by the tire bracing his elbow on his knees . He jammed the wrench onto the top lug , held it there with the heel of one hand , and put his arm and shoulder into the push . The lug gave , and the other one did likewise . He took them both off and dropped them with a splash into the brimming hubcap . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of his red silk shirt was already as wet as Patsy 's dress . " Thanks , " Jim said . " This is n't my day . I guess it 's time I bought some new tires . " " Might buy a car to go with ' em , " Sonny suggested . " This one looks like it 's seen too many road signs . " He grinned at Patsy , but she did n't grin back . She was of precisely the same opinion where the Ford was concerned but managed to refrain from saying so . She sluiced the water off her hair with one hand and gave Sonny back his umbrella . " You 're Sonny Shanks , " she said . He nodded , looking at her more closely . He had a feeling he should know her , but he could n't come up with a name . The two of them were not rodeo , obviously . The green dress was stylish , even if wet , and her husband 's tone was a city tone . " I 'm Patsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I recognized the hearse of course , but actually we met a few times years ago . I guess I was about twelve then . You used to know my Aunt Dixie . " " Dixie McCormack ? " he asked , but it was a superfluous question . There was only one Dixie  --  or only one that counted . " She 's my aunt , " Patsy said . " My god , " Sonny said . " I know her okay . The only thing that 39  | keeps us apart is that I ai n't got the energy I once had . She cost me a world championship and I never went with her but three weeks . That woman 's crazy . She could foul up a two-car funeral . " " She takes some keeping up with , okay , " Patsy said . Jim let the tire slip as he was lifting it off the spokes and it splashed muddy water on their ankles and calves . " I think a coincidence like this here calls for a drink , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hearse . Let 's have a drink to Dixie while your husband finishes changing his tire . I been out of touch and ai n't heard her recent exploits , anyhow . " He took Patsy by the arm , held the umbrella over her as jauntily as if they were n't both soaked , and led her along the edge of the wet pavement to the hearse . " You look awfully smart to be a niece of Dixie 's , " he said . " Not that she 's what you 'd call dumb . " Patsy was annoyed with him for leading her away , and annoyed with herself for allowing him to , but he had done it so smoothly that she had not thought to stop him until it was too late . " Nobody thinks of Aunt Dixie in terms of smart or dumb , " she said . " Fast or slow , maybe . " " I 'd like to see her sometime when she 's slow , " he said . " I 've seen her other speed . Hop in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearse and switched on a small light . A narrow mattress and box spring took up one side of the rear , and the other side was filled with an incredible litter : clothes , ropes , boxes of tapes and gauze , a case of whiskey , bridles , and chaps . A large saddle with what seemed to be a golden saddle horn was propped against the front seat . At the rear , near the door , was the tiny bar . " It 's kind of a mess , " Sonny said ruefully . " My maid quit last week . What 'll you drink ? " " A Coke if you 've got one and if not , a little bourbon . About an inch . " Sonny stood at the rear , still in the rain , and reached inside to fix the drinks . He even had ice . " Make it bourbon , " he said . " Soda water ai n't good for a pretty girl 's complexion . " There was a green high-heel shoe laying on the bed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It was cheaply made ? the strip of inner sole was about to curl . Sonny handed her a glass .  | She put it to her lips politely and the odor of whiskey prickled her nose . She took a small sip and , when she put the glass down , became aware of another smell , which the smells of rain and mud and liquor had covered until then . It was faint but unmistakable and it came from the sheet on which she was sitting . When she realized what it was , anger and shock hit her almost at the same time . She pushed herself indignantly off the bed and one of her knees hit Sonny 's hand . He had just finished fixing his own drink and the glass slipped out of his hand and fell into the mud . Patsy scrambled awkwardly out of the hearse , almost falling . She was embarrassed and very angry . " Damn you , " she said . " What do you mean , forcing me into your hearse when you 've just . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give her back her shoe . " She sloshed halfway to the Ford , crying , then remembered that she still had the green shoe and sloshed back and threw it angrily into the hearse . Sonny watched her . He was mildly disgruntled , but more at himself than at her . He had completely forgotten May . " Well , kick me , " he said . " I 'm awful . I should have tidied things up . It ai n't no reason for you to run off , though . It 's messy everywhere tonight . " " Not like that it is n't , " Patsy said . " This was a nice rain until you came along . " She turned and walked away , furious with her aunt for having had anything to do with such a person . " Have a good swim , " Sonny said , mostly to himself . He crawled into the hearse out of the rain , opened himself a beer , sniffed at the offensive sheets , and sat on the bed sipping his beer and watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Ford . In a minute Jim came to the hearse . " Thanks for the help , " he said . " I guess we 'll have to skip the drink . The rodeo and the flat seem to have tired my wife a little . " " Do n't matter . Where you headed ? " " A stepuncle of mine has a ranch not far from here . I imagine we 'll see you again . I 'm a photographer and I 'm going to be traveling the rodeo circuit for a while . " " Oh , yeah , " Sonny said . " You 're the guy who got clobbered in Merkel . " " Right , " Jim said . " However , I got through Santa Rosa without  | being beat up . " He was a little awed to be talking to Sonny and would have liked to prolong the conversation , but , though Patsy had n't said a word to him , he knew she was furious about something , and the longer he lingered the more difficult she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes . " " Good , " Sonny said . " If your car makes it , look me up . Your wife 's a little peeved at me but she 'll get over it by then . We 'll have a party or something . " " Fine , " Jim said , flattered . " I certainly will . " When he left , Sonny rolled one of the big windows down and sat with his back propped against the front seat , drinking beer . The rain was slowing down . The clouds had already broken to the north , and stars were visible . He bent over and got himself a handful of ice and sat crunching it . Now and then a car or a diesel swished by , but there was not much traffic . Noticing May 's one green shoe , he picked it up and looked at it a minute before tossing it out the window . Then he took off his shirt and stretched out to sleep for a while . He had decided to go visit the love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several hours . PATSY COULD N'T QUITE STOP crying , and the reason she could n't was because Jim refused to understand why she had started crying in the first place . He was annoyed with her and told her she was old enough to be able to control herself better . She was almost twenty-five , and it was quite true , but it did n't help . She was not crying freshets , but her eyes kept dripping and she felt wronged and her breastbone hurt from it . They had turned off the highway and were on a little dirt road that led to the ranch house of Jim 's stepuncle , Roger Wagonner . As they drove west , the rain had slackened , but the shower had been heavy enough to make the dirt road a little slick . " I did n't smell anything , " Jim said for the second time . " You were n't sitting on the mattress . "  | " All right ! " he said . " I still do n't see that it was so terrible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prude . You could have sat somewhere else . I wanted to talk to him . " " You 're offending me , " Patsy said grimly . " So I 'm too delicate . I 'm still not going to spend the evening in a puddle of sperm just so you can talk to some stupid bull rider about a lot of stupid bulls . " It was very unsanitary , " she added . " Much as I 'd like to get pregnant , I do n't want to do it by a mattress . Especially not his mattress . " Jim was silent . He was pretending to be very careful with his driving . Her abruptness annoyed him as much as her crying , and she k new it . His annoyance annoyed her . She would have liked him to be light and joshing  --  if he had been she might have become convinced that the whole thing was funny . But she had deprived him of a pleasure , and he was n't immediately ready to let her forget it . They had been married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not learned to control either her abruptness or her tears . He had just better get used to them  --  and the sooner the better , she felt . " I am too a prude , " she said in a small tone , wiping her cheeks with her hands . " It 's my only distinction . I may be the last prude . You 're a cruel beast to want to deprive me of my prudery . " " Oh , shut up , " he said loudly , making her jump . " I 'm going to see him in Phoenix , " he added , more quietly . " You do n't have to come if you do n't want to . " " I certainly do n't , " she said , perking up a little . She saw that he was ashamed of having yelled at her . " If he was good enough for your aunt I do n't see why you need he so snooty . After all , he 's been World 's Champion Cowboy three times . That saddle in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a saddle , " she said . " It was an altar . I bet he de'flowers a virgin on it every week . " They crossed a cattle guard and circled the dark ranch house . Jim parked by the back-yard gate and began to collect his cameras from the back seat . His annoyance would not subside . Patsy had a genius for fouling up evenings , but she did it in such a way that it ; elms never clearly her fault , and he could never feel really justified in his annoyance . " If he liked your aunt he could n't have much taste for virgins , " he said . 3  | Patsy drew herself up . " Such remarks are not apropos , " she said . " I love my Aunt Dixie and do n't you be snippy about her . She just happens to have a weakness for organs , that 's all . " It had rained more at the ranch house than it had on the road leading to it . They squished across the wet back yard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a towsack on the back porch for them to wipe their feet on . Jim wiped his , but Patsy merely slipped off her shoes . The house was completely dark , and though it was the third night of their stay they were still unfamiliar with its layout . They bumped things and stepped on a great many squeaky boards . Patsy felt very tired . Jim offered her the bathroom first but she declined it and merely dried her wet hair on a towel from her suitcase . It was one of those times when she did n't feel like taking care of herself , and she undressed and got into her nightgown hastily and was in bed when Jim returned from the bathroom . He came in shortly and turned on the overhead light  --  there was no other . The room was still a little dusty from long disuse , and there was nothing in it but a straight chair , a bed , and an old brown bureau . The wallpaper had once been green but was faded almost gray and was blotchy on the ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she hid under the sheet until Jim noticed and switched it off again . " I guess people never read in this country , " she said . " They have n't heard about bed lights . " Jim was standing by the open window . A light drizzle had started up again and he stood listening to it . " I ought to get those films ready to mail , " he said . " I want to get them off first thing in the morning . " " Please do it in the morning . It 's nice in here dark , and awful when you turn the light on . " Without answering , he came and stretched out on the bed , close against her , his body cool for a second . " Anyway , I bet you surprised him , " he said . " He 's probably not used to girls jumping out of his hearse . " " I 'm not used to sitting in stuck , either , " she said . " At least not in other people 's . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patsy , " he said . " Prude and martyr . " He yawned and rubbed his forehead against  | her shoulder . " Maybe you are n't going to like being a photographer 's wife . " She lay facing away from him , on her side , and he reached one hand across her as if to touch her loins but then rested the hand on her hip instead . In two or three minutes he was sleeping , and the drizzle and the sounds of Jim 's breathing were the only sounds she heard . She fitted her back and legs against his body and soon felt warm and relaxed . She loved to listen to the rain . She drew Jim 's arm across her and held it beneath her breasts . Often she felt closest to him just after he had gone to sleep , especially if he went to sleep at a time when she wanted quiet rather than talk . The rain made a lovely sound and a lovely smell , and as she became more content she became more wakeful . She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . After a time she slept , but not very long . When she woke it was still dark outside . She could never sleep long or deeply in strange beds . Jim had turned over , so that only the curves of their backs were touching . Patsy felt sure morning could n't be far away , and she got up and put on her robe and tiptoed down the cool barefloored hall to the bathroom . Her hair felt gritty from two nights of rodeo , and it seemed a good enough time to wash it . The bathtub was old , narrow , and deep , with some of the enamel chipped off around the edges . The water pressure was very low , only u strong dribble , and she knew from the previous day 's experience that it would take a good thirty minutes for the tub to fill to the level she liked . She left the water running and slipped back through the dust-scented hall to the bedroom and got herself a book and tiptoed down the cool stairs to the kitchen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the strong gray soap that Uncle Roger used at the sink . She turned on the light , got a glass of water , and made herself a peanut butter sandwich . There had been no peanut butter on hand when they arrived , so she had bought some In Vernon for just such an emergency . The kitchen window was open ; through it she could hear the squabblings of chickens . She as reading Incidents of Travel in Yucatan , a good book to read t annoying because the pages would n't stay open . She had been reading it at intervals for a month and was sixty pages into Volume 11 . She tried setting the peanut butter jar on the top margins , but at did n't work very well , so she gobbled her sandwich and then  | read , picking up crumbs with her fingertips and eating them . When she went back upstairs the bath was still not ready and she sat on the toilet and read until it was . She stuck the book in a closet on top of some towels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and soaked , scrubbed her knees and toes and back , soaked some more , washed her hair , and soaked still more , the wet ends of her hair dripping streams of water onto her chest and shoulders . Given half a chance she could bathe for an hour . While she was drying herself she heard Roger Wagonner pass the door and go downstairs . The mirror over the lavatory was small and not very helpful , and she went back to the bedroom to attend to her hair . Jim was sleeping soundly , his body curled toward the part of the bed where she had been . His shoulders were goose-pimpled by the morning coolness . Patsy pulled the sheet up over him and sat on the bed for a minute rubbing his shoulders until the goose bumps went away . He had not shaved the day before and in the gray early light she could see , when she bent over him , the line of light blond whiskers on his jaw , the same color as the light hairs on his chest . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was then that he seemed most like the man that she wanted him to be , and she felt respectful of him and pulled the sheet a little higher before she got up . She went and sat by the window in the straight spindly brown chair , rubbing her hair with a towel . Outside , a cow was bawling at intervals , and in a few minutes Patsy saw her trailing slowly toward the barn . She was a small Jersey , and the calf that trotted after her was incongruously large and red . Uncle Roger had explained to her that the calf was adopted , and not the result of any irregular behavior on the cow 's part . The country smelled cool and wet . The sky was quite clear , and a white moon , already fading slightly , hung high in the southwest . Patsy concluded that they were right , those people who said dawn was as lovely as evening . She had never been awake so early , and the few times she had been up early at all she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , hunting clothes and stockings and cosmetics , and it had not been pleasant . But she was there , and settled , and clean and wide awake , and had a book to read and a husband sleeping nearby and her hair to dry in its own  | time , and the morning seemed beautiful . The sun was up , she could tell , but the window where she sat was on the west side of the house and the sun was still low in the east . After a while its rays began to touch the green mesquite trees on the slope south of the house and to touch the wet grass . The damp ground had begun to give up a little mist . She used a dryer when at home , but since she was n't at home she rubbed her hair vigorously with the towel from time to time , examining the ends closely to see if they were splitting . In a few minutes she heard Roger Wagonner slam the back door and saw him walk through the yard , his milk bucket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back gate . He glanced at it with the curious unbelieving glance people always gave the Ford , as if he was pained and amazed that such a vehicle had been removed from the junkyard where it belonged and parked on his property . The Ford was six years old . Jim had had it four years before they were married . They could easily afford another car , but Jim was sentimental about the Ford and stubbornly refused to sell it . They had discovered each other in the car , and he had got it bound up with their love in some way . They spent their first full night together parked in the Ford on a hill near White Rock Lake , in Dallas , kissing and talking . Patsy was misty enough about the night herself , but not so misty about the Ford that she could ignore the fact that it was falling apart . Only the month before they had been stranded for six hours in a garage in Riley , Texas , with a broken timing gear . " Are we going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . She read three magazines and all of Pnin while the Ford sat in a blackened garage full of oilcans . Jim ignored her and talked to the mechanic . " Look , I married you for life , " she said , trying again , once they were on their way back to Dallas . " If we 're going to keep this car as our hearts ' museum or something , we might as well have it bronzed . " " 1 fell in love with you in this car , " he said , not impressed with her wit ; and they continued to drive it . The chickens came out to meet Roger , the hens scolding bitterly , and he clucked them out of the way and walked on to the barn through the milky shin-high mist . His pickup was parked between the chicken house and the barn , an ancient Chevrolet twice as old as the Ford , with sideboards that had not been painted in so long that they were gray . 147  | He called to the milk cow and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun was burning the mist away . When he emerged from the barn he had a full bucket of milk and set it carefully on a wheelbarrow near the lot . He filled a hayrack with yellow hay and got his milk bucket and carried it slowly to the house . Patsy felt talkative . She laid her book and comb on the windowsill , belted her blue robe about her , and skipped quickly down the stairs to meet him . " Hi , " she said . " So this is what morning 's like . Want me to help you with breakfast ? " Roger was a tall old man , with hair thin and quite white and so molded to his temples by years of being beneath the same hat that it stayed molded even when he took the hat off . " Sure , start helping , " he said . He set the heavy milk bucket on the smooth blanched wood of the drainboard . Patsy had watched him strain it through some cheesecloth into a strainer only the evening before , and she determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She began to open drawers at random , looking for the cheesecloth . Roger became nervous as she rapidly progressed through the drawers . He got the cheesecloth , which hung on a towel rack over the sink . " You 're an energetic creature , Patsy , " he said . " Do n't you have no shoes ? You been here two days now and I ai n't seen you with shoes on yet . " Patsy was busy reopening the drawers he had just closed , as she had in mind cooking bacon and wanted a fork to turn it with . She noticed that he was watching her as if he expected to have the entire contents of his cabinets dumped on the kitchen floor , and actually a good number of implements were scattered on the drainboard , but she intended to put them back as soon as she had a chance . The blue milk strainer , an antique almost , stood on the back porch . She held the cheesecloth between her teeth and used both hands to carry the milk bucket out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pour too she did n't know , and Roger Wagonner did n't know either . Whatever he envisioned her doing made him so nervous that he undiplomatically took the bucket and strained the milk himself while she went back and started the bacon frying . " You do n't trust me , " she said . " You 're perfectly right not to . I  | do n't know why I think I 'm a milkmaid , but it seems a lovely thing to be on a morning like this . I guess I must have read about milkmaids . Thomas Hardy has them in numerous books and they 're always at their best on mornings like this . If we 're going to have biscuits you 'll have to make them and I 'll do the oven part . I 've never made biscuits from scratch . " Watching her wandering about the kitchen in her blue robe , standing on one foot now and then to scratch her bare calf with a toe , Roger Wagonner shook his head and resigned himself with a smile to the chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacon but then sat down at the table to peel an orange and eat it , dropping the peel and in time each seed on a white napkin spread on the checkered oilcloth . She talked all the while of the mist and the milk cow and this and that , and Roger fixed the biscuits and fried four eggs hard as stones and got the breakfast around her . It was not until he bent over stiffly and slowly to peer into the oven at the browning biscuits , and the hip pocket of his faded Levi 's came into her vision , that Patsy remembered she had been going to cook . " Oh , dear , " she said , blushing and jumping up . She ran to the cabinet and looked desperately for something to do , but he had even put the plates on the table while she was chattering . " I 'm terrible , " she said . " You have every right to be suspicious of me . I 'm completely impractical . " " Now quit apologizin ' and let 's eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clean brown khaki work shirt with the cuffs turned up . The hair on his wrists was as white as the hair on his head , but his wrists were strong-looking , old as he was . He cut through his eggs diagonally . They had been fried in bacon grease and the outsides were brown . " I guess I 'm a shade nervous , " he said . " Have n't had to cope with a female in this kitchen in the morning for eleven years . That 's how long it 's been since Mary got killed . " He said the last merely as one states a fact , with no self-pity or nostalgia . Patsy could not understand how he could eat eggs fried so hard . " How come you fry them that way ? " she asked . " Because it do n't take no talent . You just leave ' em in the frying pan till they 're hard enough to bounce . " The coffee stopped perking at just that time and Patsy noticed  | and jumped up before Roger could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cups were white and thick and had little thin cracks running down their sides . Roger immediately poured half of his coffee into a saucer . His food was already gone . He tilted his chair back , the saucer in one hand , and began to blow on the coffee gently and sip it as it steamed . " Mary never went barefooted that I can remember , " he said , still more thoughtful than nostalgic . " Apparently ladies did n't in earlier days , " Patsy said , contemplating the two brown eggs that seemed to be her responsibility . The peanut butter , the orange , and a sliver of bacon had filled her completely and she was nervous about the eggs . She had heard that in the country food was never wasted . " Where you and Jim going next ? " " Phoenix . " " Going in that car ? " " Sure . " She felt suddenly loyal to the Ford . She cut a little corner off one egg to see what the yolk of an egg looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's our only car . Your pickup is older than it is and you still drive it , do n't you ? " " Well , naturally , " Roger said . " No use buying nothin ' new at my age . I do n't go out tourin ' the world in it , though . Besides , I 'm pore . If old Jim 's gon na haul you all over the country he ought a buy you a better automobile than that . He can afford it . You could probably even get a pair of shoes out of him if you sweet-talked him a little . " Patsy sighed and started to eat the bite of egg and then decided not to eat any egg . She felt too good to stuff herself with things she did n't want , duty or no duty . Perhaps there were pigs that the eggs could be fed to , though she had not noticed any . " He does n't like being able to afford so much , you see , " she said gravely . Jim 's wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new rich , his not so new , and far richer . She did not think it would be polite to talk about the problem of having too much money to a person who had the problem of having too little . " Just leave them eggs , honey , " Roger said kindly . " I 've seen strong men who could n't choke down my cooking . Why would anyone not like being able to afford things ? I 've wished I was able to afford things all my life . " " You 're a nice man , " she said smiling , but she felt almost tearful.  | Small gracious things , like about the eggs , sometimes flooded her with feelings of gratitude . A shadow came under her eyes and the old man saw it . " He does n't really know how to do any one thing , " she said . " But he can afford not to , of course . He just hates it . It 's such a silly problem to have when there are so many people , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Uncle Roger looked at her and she saw in his lined , firm face and the twist of his smile that she had touched him , that even though they had only known each other three days he was fond of her , perhaps had just become fond of her as they sat at the breakfast table . Her throat closed and she was choked with feeling and began to scrape with her toenail at the white paint on the thin table legs . " I 'm so emotional , " she said with a quaver . He chuckled and reached across the napkin full of orange seeds and patted her hand . " Well , what you and him need to do is buy my ranch , " he said . " Then pretty soon you 'd be as broke as me and you would n't have no problems like that . " He stood up , neatly arranged his plate , knife , fork , cup , and saucer , and carried them to the sink . " Wish you 'd clean up these dishes for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three days ' work to do today and I better get started . " He reached into the cabinet , got a toothpick out of a box , and stood looking at her thoughtfully while he picked his teeth . " Only drawback to that is that you might not be no better at ranchin ' than I am , " he said . " I been at it fifty years and get worse at it ever year . Least that 's the way it looks in the bankbook . " Patsy looked up in disbelief . " Oh , come on , " she said . " I ca n't imagine you not being good at things . You just look like you 'd be good at things . " " Oh , well , that 's just my noble bearing , " he said , smiling and pleased . " You seen yourself how I cooked them eggs . One nice thing about a wife , she keeps a man reminded of how good for nothin ' he is . Mary used to let me know her low opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day hoping I could change it . Never did . She bawled me out the morning she went and had the car wreck . " He went out to the back porch and got his straw hat and then came back to the door of the kitchen . Patsy sat at the table , her feet drawn up to the top rung of her chair .  | " I will wash the dishes , " she said . " Do n't worry . " " I wo n't . Hope you-all can find enough to eat to keep you from starving . " She was expecting some advice , some country platitude about life and its problems , but Roger just tipped his faded straw hat to her and turned and left . When she heard the pickup start she got up and did the few dishes , leisurely , not liking the heavy soap but unable to find any detergent . She did like standing at the sink by the open window , smelling the cool morning and the trees and weeds of the north yard . It surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smells when it was dampened a little . Once finished , she put the dishes away where she hoped they belonged and , since Roger was not there to be nervous , poked around in the cabinet a bit to see what was there . The knives and forks and most of the utensils were old , so old that most of them had wooden handles , very smooth from many washings and with a faint woody smell of their own . She liked them , they seemed better to the touch than her own stainless and sterling , and it occurred to her that if she and Jim ever did do anthying crazy like buy a ranch she would certainly have all sorts of wood in her kitchen  --  wooden spoons and wooden bowls and perhaps a huge wooden block for cutting meat on . With a bright woody good-smelling kitchen with a window that looked out on a slope and a deep sky , her cooking might even improve , though probably not . She would stand and look out too long . She went slowly back up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat again in the chair by the window , rubbing lotion into her hands . Jim was sleeping on his back . She felt a little lonely and would have liked him awake , but probably he would wake up either sulky or sexy and at the moment she felt as cool and unpassionate as if she had become a virgin again . More likely still , he would wake up professional ; there were four days ' worth of pictures to be mailed . The next day they were to go to Phoenix , and as Jim was a fanatic marathon driver it would probably be a very long day . She took off her robe , got Incidents of Travel in Yucatan , and lay on the bed on her stomach reading and occasionally tickling her husband 's chest with the ends of her hair , until the warming day made her drowsy and she flopped the book open on the floor by the bed and went to sleep .  | ELEANOR BREAKFASTED outside in the summertime , on the second-floor patio of her ranch house . She exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patio , and then she showered and put on a slip and a white robe and went back outside , her heavy graying blond hair pulled back and held by an orange headband . The ranch house was a long two-story brown stucco that her mother had built in the twenties , when she was no longer able to abide the creaking three-story frame mansion that had been the Guthrie home for two generations . The patio was on the east side of the house , sunny in the mornings , shady in the afternoons , and was Eleanor 's favorite place on the whole ranch . She sat at a tiled table at the edge of the patio looking down on the long green lawn that stretched south almost to the barns and corrals . Lucy brought her a grapefruit and some French toast and coffee , and she leafed through a New Yorker as she ate , mostly looking at the ads and the cartoons . Below her the Mexican gardeners were already at work , spading the flower beds and getting ready to water the hedges . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowhands were saddling up , fiddling with their girths and rope and listening to the foreman outline the day 's work . To the north were her wheatfields , stretching halfway to Red River , and , beyond the barns , to the south and west , the rolling broken country of the ranch spread in a great circle . The ranch house was almost on its rim . She ate the French toast and would have liked more but did n't call Lucy . The sun was up , the air bright and still cool . Soon the air would be merely a shimmer of heat and she would be driven inside . As she ate and turned pages and watched the cowboys mounting she saw a white elongating cloud of dust on the road that led from the highway to the ranch house . The highway was three miles away ; the road that led to it ran between the wheatfields and the horse pasture . Long before the hearse swung into the circular driveway below her , Eleanor knew who was coming . Others drove as fast as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that hour of the morning ; and anyway , she always knew when Sonny was coming . In fifteen years she had learned to tell . 53  | He parked the hearse just beneath her and got out but did n't look up . In a few minutes she heard the click of his bootheels as he crossed the bedroom floor . All the floors in the house were dark wood , kept bare except for a few Mexican rugs . She looked up at him just as his hand gave her shoulder a quick hard squeeze . " Why , hello , " she said . Sonny bent and kissed her lightly and then went around the table . " I 'm starved , " he said . His chin was dark with stubble , his black hair tousled and uncombed , and his shirttail out . Though he smiled at her arrogantly , he looked a little bushed . " Sit down and have breakfast with me , " she said . " We can chat about old times . " " How you fixed for steaks ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are our reason for existing . Ask Lucy to fix you one . " " I do n't think I ate yesterday , " he said . " Maybe I 'll ask her to fix me two . " He did , and also fixed himself a drink , and came back and sat down across from her , swirling the ice in his glass . " Beautiful as ever , " he said . " You dye them streaks in ? " " I 've never dyed my hair , " she said . " As you well know . " Her eyes were still on The New Yorker . Sonny stood up , smiled , took the magazine from her , whistled sharply at one of the Mexican gardeners , and cooly sailed The New Yorker over the patio railing . Its pages fluttered as it fell to the ground . The gardener was fat and slow and did n't catch it , but he picked it up and without waiting for instructions took it into the house to Lucy , who understood all mysteries . " You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritated . " I like to read while I eat . " " If there was another woman like you around I 'd marry her , " Sonny said pleasantly . He squished some bourbon around in his mouth as if it were mouthwash . " If I was to get married , then you could sit around out here and read magazines for the rest of your goddamn life . " " I can , anyway , " Eleanor said . " As a matter of fact that 's what I 've done most of my life . I love to sit out here and read magazines . I expect to do essentially that until I die . " Sonny sagged in his chair , one foot on the railing of the balcony .  | He looked very tired and said nothing more . Eleanor filed her nails . The exercise , the shower , and the breakfast had left her feeling good , but slightly lethargic ; it was pleasant not to have to move . In a few minutes Lucy came in with Sonny 's breakfast , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a rare steak on it . There was also a bowl of green onions , some hot bread and a plate of butter , his whiskey bottle and a bowl of cracked ice . " You 're worth your wages , Lucy , " he said , pulling himself up to the table . Lucy was a heavy aging Negress who had done all her aging on the Guthrie ranch , most of it as Eleanor 's personal maid . She had three gold teeth , a house in town , and enough sense to get herself out of the way when her mistress was in certain moods . " Thank you , Mr. Sonny , " she said and left . In other moods , when Eleanor was gay , Lucy and Sonny enjoyed teasing each other . They were both expert at banter . Sonny bent to his steaks and ate silently . Eleanor looked him over in quick glances . He had probably slept in the hearse , if he had slept . There were little flecks of lint in his black hair , and even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut the steaks quickly and skillfully with a small steak knife and ate them without lifting his eyes from the plate , now and then crunching one of the garden onions in two bites , and now and then sopping a hunk of the hot French bread in the drippings from the steaks . The flash of his teeth as he bit into the green stem of an onion caused her to look away , hack at her nails . When he finished he poured some more bourbon into his glass , tilted back his chair , and put both boots on the railing . He grinned at her happily . " Hardly anything beats a good meal , " he said . His voice was fresh again . He often seemed able to shrug off fatigue , to freshen himself by some internal movement , some twist within himself . " Well , I 'm glad we could oblige you , " she said , looking him in the eye . Sonny 's gray-blue eyes were burglers , always looking for a crack , a lock left unlocked , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fifteen years , but his look still made her feel stubborn . He crunched a piece of ice between his teeth and looked down idly at the three gardeners . " I got to be gettin ' to Phoenix , " he said . " Thought you might want to ride along . We ai n't been nowhere together lately . "  | For a second it was on the tip of her tongue to make a bitchy comeback , but she was suddenly touched with discouragement and instead straightened her legs beneath the table and looked down at her bare toes . She had tried to bitch him away on many occasions and had never succeeded , and anyway he was Sonny and she did n't feel bitchy . She smiled a little wearily and raised an eyebrow . " Where did we ever go together except to bed , old buddy ? " she said . Sonny squinted at the sky , then got up suddenly and went into the bedroom . He came back with a package of her cigarettes . He lit one and tossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some dances , " he said . " And a bullfight down in May-hi-co . Them dances was n't much , I admit . We must have gone somewhere , we been in the papers often enough . " " That 's because I 'm Eleanor Guthrie , " she said . " If a man so much as holds my coat we 're in the papers , at least in Texas . It 's one of the small disadvantages of being an heiress . Of course it usually flatters the man who holds my coat . Sometimes it even flatters me . " " Yeah , that 's the way it is being a world 's champion cowboy too , " Sonny said , grinning . " You pat some cutie on the butt and the next morning the papers have got you engaged . Ai n't it awful what us heiresses and champions have to put up with ? I guess that 's why you and me always worked out so well . We got the same kind of problems . " " Okay , okay , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and came around the table and bent to kiss her again but Eleanor jerked her head away . Sonny grinned . " Not feeling sweet ? " he said . " Not on your life , you arrogant bastard , " she said . " I have n't seen you in two months . You have n't even called in two weeks . You ca n't just walk in here and con me into bed , not any more . Go away so I can read my magazines in peace . " " Well , you knew the rodeo was in town , " Sonny said . He blew a puff of smoke her way disgruntled . " Got any pills ? I ai n't been watching and I 'm about out . " " How careless of you , " Eleanor said . " I hope somebody gets you pregnant . Look in the bathroom and help yourself . " Sonny did and then came back and stood restlessly on the patio  | tossing a little vial of pills in his hand . After a moment he stuffed it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her chair , close enough that she could smell him  --  his breath always smelled faintly of whiskey and his skin faintly of sweat . She expected him to touch her , to run his hand down inside the robe and rub the furrow of her back . She knew exactly how his hand felt there . Her skin waited for it and the rest of her prepared to twist away angrily , but Sonny did n't touch her . He walked over to the bedroom door and stood looking at her thoughtfully . " Thanks for them steaks , " he said . " Tell Lucy she left ' em on a little too long . Still wish you 'd come to Phoenix with me . Come on if you change your mind . I 'll be at the Ramada . Nice seeing you even if you ai n't feeling sweet . " " Oh , go on , " Eleanor said . " Maybe I 'll come , I do n't know . If I do I 'll fly . Why could n't you have called me before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never thought to , " he said . Then she heard his heels in the bedroom again and stood up , distressed . He often spoiled things , but when he did he always managed to leave her with the sense that she had only herself to blame . Her back had wanted him to rub it and the skin between her shoulder blades felt itchy and tight . She pulled the orange headband off her head and stood at the railing waiting for him to come out and get in the hearse . He strode out and paused to kick at the left front tire of the hearse  --  it looked low . Before he got in he looked up at her . " Hey , thanks for the pills too , " he said . " I do n't know what us celebrities would do without pills . " " You 're welcome to them , " she said . " Maybe I 'll see you in Arizona . " He waved , and whirled the hearse around the driveway . She stood at the railing and watched him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas pumps and an air hose . He filled the hearse up and aired his tires . When he circled back near the house , the sun reflecting off the gold horns on the top of the hearse , things crowded into her head and chest and she stood crying , watching the cloud of white dust stretch back toward the highway . It was a wretched and indulgent thing , her sorrow  --  or so she felt , for who could be less worthy of pity than a lonely multimillionairess , one , moreover , who still had her looks . But there it was , and she could not help crying , 57  | the pride that had made her reject him all gone . The pride had not brought her solace in her whole life , yet she could never put it off . She went in and rinsed her face in cold water for several minutes , and she was dressing for a conference with her ranch manager when Lucy came in and looked at her fondly . " Well , how 's he ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He reminded me to tell you that the steaks were overdone . " She was standing in a walk-in cedar closet  --  she liked the smell of the wood . After a moment 's consideration she took down a brown silk blouse . Lucy chuckled , then sighed . " Mr. Sonny do n't change , " she said . " Particular ai n't the word for him . " " It 'll do , " Eleanor said grimly . " I think he wants me to dye my hair . " She picked a tan skirt and stood musing . Her bra was too tight and she shrugged , trying to loosen it . " If Daddy had only let me date cowboys I might have been spared all this , do n't you think ? " " Naw , Miss Eleanor , " Lucy said and shook her head with such a ponderous assurance of her own wisdom that Eleanor could not help but be amused and a little cheered . She sat down at her dresser and picked up a bottle of coconut oil . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , scram , you fountain of sympathy , " she said , considering the gray streaks . " I 'm perfectly all right . " Lucy sighed heavily again and shuffled off and Eleanor sat at the dresser brushing her hair until the tightness between her shoulder blades had gone away . As PATSY HAD FEARED , Jim wanted to make Phoenix in one long drive . Their alarm went off at two-thirty A.M. It woke Jim , but Patsy , improvident as ever , had read late and was sleeping unusually soundly . The alarm did n't faze her . Jim dressed in the dark and made two tiptoe trips down the stairs loading the Ford . While he was peering into the back end trying to be 58  | sure he had everything , a light came on in the kitchen window . When he went back in , Roger was at the stove fixing breakfast . " Sorry if I woke you , " Jim said . " Oh , it 's might near mornin ' , " Roger said . Jim really wanted to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the only polite thing to do was eat . " Patsy not going to eat ? " " I 'll be lucky if I can get her awake enough to walk to the car . " " Well , I never cooked her no eggs , anyway . She do n't care much for my fried eggs . " Jim ate hurriedly , restless and anxious to be off . He was always anxious at the start of trips , even routine trips , and the trip coming tip was not routine . Roger sipped his coffee and watched him thoughtfully . " Well , I hope you get some good photos , " he said . " Seems to me like a long way to go just to take pictures of bronc riders , but then I 'm ignorant as a bat about such things . " He got up and stood by the stove a minute staring indecisively at the skillet of bacon grease , trying to calculate whether it was worth saving . Finally he set it in the oven . " If I had to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room in the loony bin by the fall , " he said . " Never knowed a rodeo cowboy who had any sense . If you-all meet any , bring ' em by sometime . " Jim carried his plate to the sink and hurried up to wake Patsy . She slept lightly except on those few occasions when he needed her awake , and then she was all but unwakable . Jim pulled her upright and sat her on the edge of the bed , and she sat there sound asleep in a green nightgown , her head lolling over like a child 's . When he finally got her half awake she stood up and stripped off the nightgown , dropped it on the floor , walked over to the bureau , and put her head on her arms and stood there nude , asleep . " Come on , sweetie , " Jim said . " We 've got to go . " Patsy turned reluctantly and found her bra but had difficulty letting it on . She got her breasts in their cups and stood groggily in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms behind her hack . She stood for almost a minute before Jim noticed her . " Oh , damn , " he said . " Hurry up . Please fasten your other snaps . " " Why are we leaving at midnight ? " she asked . " I just finished reading . "  | " It 's not midnight , it 's almost three o'clock . " " Just as I thought , midnight , " she said and collapsed in a warm sleepy heap on the bed , still clad only in her bra . " Get up , Patsy , " he said grumpily , his patience slipping . " You 're grumpy with me , " she said , her face hidden under her hair . " Why are you grumpy ? Come and make love to me for eight hours while I get some sleep . I do n't want to go anywhere tonight . " Jim pulled her up a little roughly and pleaded with her , and she woke up , irritated . She shoved him away . " Get your grumpy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short frenzy of activity . She grabbed panties , blouse , and shorts and strode off to the bathroom to brush her teeth . In a minute she was back , dressed , and grabbed her book and purse and foam rubber pillow and stumbled down the stairs . Roger and his old nondescript dog Bob were standing by the Ford in the faint moonlight . When Patsy saw them she pitched her stuff into the car and went over impulsively and hugged Roger . His brown shirt smelled of starch and tobacco . " I like your house , " she said . " I wish I were staying here . Thank you for being nice . " " Bye , honey , " Roger said . " If this vehicle falls apart call me and I 'll come and get you in the pickup . Old Jim can hitchhike back . " " I wish he 'd hitchhike away . " She got in the car , settled her pillow by the window , and went back to sleep . Roger peered in at her a little anxiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " You sure she 's all right ? " Going off without breakfast was to him a shocking act . " She 's fine . Thanks for letting us stay . Maybe we 'll get back by in the late summer when our travels are over . " " Hope so , " Roger said . " Me and Bob will be here , if neither of us do n't die . I guess I 'll go in and drink some more coffee . It 's too early to milk and too late to go back to bed . " When Jim circled toward the rattly cattle guard he saw Roger going in at the back door . A mile from the house , when he turned onto the highway leading to Vernon , he could still see the light in the kitchen window , as visible as a star in the darkened country . A coyote loped across the road in front of him , his eyes golden in the headlights . He ducked under a barbed-wire fence and vanished into the mesquite . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cafe called The Big  | Rig . A thin short young man was leaning against the wall of the cafe , a small traveling bag at his feet and a pile of rigging beside it . tic was a rookie bronc rider named Peewee Raskin . " How y'all ? " he said , coming over . " That 's timing for you . I just waked up . " Peewee was friendly , informative , and broke . Jim had met him three days before and had taken a liking to him and promised him a ride to Phoenix  --  a promise he had not mentioned to Patsy . She was not very hot on the idea of going to Phoenix , or anywhere where there were rodeos , and he knew that presenting her with Peewee in the abstract would only lead to argument . Peewee in the flesh was harder to resist . They stowed his gear in the back end and Peewee managed to worm his way into the back seat through Jim 's door . He eyed Patsy dubiously . " Snoozin ' , ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pile of dresses and a cardboard box full of paperback books . He had spent the night in a horsetrailer behind the cafe and smelled of hay and horse manure . When they drove off , Jim left his window down , hoping the smell would blow away before Patsy woke up . As soon as the car started moving , Peewee ! caned his head back against the seat and went to sleep , his black cowboy hat covering his face . Jim angled southwest , driving a steady seventy-five . Though it was quite a bit farther , he wanted to go the southern route , through El Paso ; the shorter route , through central New Mexico , held no attraction for him . He drove in darkness for more than an hour , then it was gray , then brightening . As he turned more and more westward the rising sun came up behind him and shone in his rearview mirror . The country was still and dewy , the fields freshly plowed , and the pastures white with mist . He passed a cluster of oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road from them , the pumper sitting on his front steps with his socks in his hand , scratching his shins . Patsy was curled in the seat , her face hidden , goose bumps on her slim legs . The sun was well up before she awoke . She yawned , sat up , reached in her blouse to readjust a breast , and hooked a finger inside her shorts to scratch herself . " Sleeping in cars makes my clothes feel too tight , " she said , looking vacantly at the morning country . " If there are johns in towns in this part of the wasteland find me one with a john , would you ? " " Rig Spring will have one . "  | Then Patsy caught a whiff of Peewee and turned and looked at him with astonishment . His only visible feature was his open mouth ? the hat obscured the rest of his face . His belt buckle was also visible , a huge silver oval with a ruby-eyed steerhead for ornamentation . " Hey , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this ? " " He was broke , " Jim said . " He barely has the money for his entry fees . I thought we 'd give him a ride . " " Gee , he 's small for a cowboy , is n't he ? " she said , giving Peewee a friendly inspection . " Most of them are immense . " " He seems to know everything there is to know about rodeo , " Jim said . " He 'll make things a lot easier for me . " " It would make things a lot easier for me if you 'd hurry up and get us to Big Spring , chum . " When they stopped she hurried off barefoot to the rest room , swinging her black purse by the straps . Jim got out to stretch his legs , had a Coke and went himself , signed the credit card slip , and sat in the driver 's seat fidgeting for five minutes before Patsy emerged looking no different than she had when she went in . She got herself a Coke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driveway and followed it leisurely until it stopped rolling , went and got herself a package of cheese crisps from a candy machine , chatted and laughed for two or three minutes with an attendant in a green shirt , and ambled happily back to the Ford , sipping her Coke and still swinging her purse . " Got a nickel ? " she asked cheerfully . " I want some gum and all I 've got left is some pennies and a twenty . " " I 've got some gum , " Jim said . " Come on and get in . The rodeo starts tomorrow . " " What kind of gum ? " she asked . " Spearmint . " " Give me a nickel then , please , " she said , reaching in her hand . " I want some Dentyne . " Jim only had a quarter in change , so he gave her that and she ambled back and leaned against the water cooler , looking at the sky and idly combing her hair while the attendant finished gassing up another car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and skipped quickly back . " Sorry , " she said , biting open the cheese crisps and blowing the  | little tip of cellophane out the window . " Ca n't stand Spearmint . " Peewee had slept soundly through the stop , but the minute they started moving again he woke up and his hat fell over into the box of paperbacks . Patsy felt a little shy about him but she knew that Jim was annoyed at her for her laggardly qualities and she welcomed something to distract her from his annoyance . " Hello , " she said , turning around and smiling at Peewee . She saw immediately , once his hat was off , that he was too young to be shy about . He had short reddish brown hair and a slightly crooked nose . l le looked about sixteen . Peewee smiled tentatively . He was blinking and trying to get the sleep out of his eyes , and it took him much aback to be spoken to at a critical juncture in his waking . And the girl who had spoken was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her eyes were merry and gray , and she had a straight nose that wrinkled a bit when she smiled , and her smile was merry too . She wore no makeup but she had a comb in her hand and now and then ran it through her black hair . " I 'm Patsy , " she said . " Very pleased to meet you . " " Uh , yeah , " Peewee said , feeling very , very shy . He wished he was tidier and tried to tidy himself a bit , but his canvas bag was in the trunk and there was not much he could do except try to tuck his shirttail in better . Patsy kept looking at him , her chin resting on her arm , which was across the back seat . " Peewee Raskin , " he said . " Nice to meet you . " " What do you do , Peewee ? " " Uh , " Peewee said . For a moment he was honestly unable to remember what he did . Patsy saw that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the road for a minute to give him a chance . Somebow he looked like a likable person , irresistibly hopeless . Jim was driving with iron concentration , determined to make up for the few minutes he had lost at the service station . He knew it was ridiculous , but despite himself he could n't help making schedules and straining horribly to keep them . Patsy could n't stand schedules and was glad Peewee had turned up in the back seat . They could make friends . Peewee soon recovered himself and was glad when Patsy looked back at him again . He took up the question of what he did . " Uh , I rodeo , " he said . " Much as I can afford to , anyway . This  | here 's actually my first year to be a pro . My folks thought I or-tent to a turned pro yet but I figure the younger the better , you know . So I done it . " I ai n't actually won no money yet , " he added apologetically . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bet you will any time . What do you ride ? " " Bareback horses , " he said . " Try to , that is . I ai n't actually stayed on one yet , either . These pro horses they 're a different pot of beans from them amateur horses I was used to . " " My goodness , how complicated . I did n't know there were professional broncs . " " Aw , yeah , " Peewee said seriously , warming to his subject . " You got to learn ' em , you see . Study ' em , I mean , so you know what to expect . Like the other night I drew this old red horse and the boys told me I ort to take a short rein so I done it an ' the ol ' son of a bitch , uh , the ol ' so-an ' - so stood on his head and yanked me off flat of my face . " Patsy giggled , delighted with him . He was not only hopelessly hopeless but hopelessly genuine too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " You should n't take advice from your competitors , should you ? " Peewee looked at her blankly , as if the idea that he would have competitors had never occurred to him . In truth , it had never occurred to him that anyone would regard him as competition . " Aw , they would n't have needed to do that , " he said . " I could n't have rode the old son of a bitch anyway . " Patsy noticed that he was fidgeting  --  he had a look of discomfort on his face . He kept shifting the position of his legs . " Are you too crowded back there ? " she asked . " I 'm sure we could cram some of that stuff into the luggage compartment . " " Uh , no , I 'm just fine , " Peewee said , still squirming . He gazed out the window as if he had some inner pain , and Patsy felt perturbed . He was a very likable boy . One of his front teeth was chipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too large . Watching him squirm , it occurred to her that in all likelihood his problem was the one she had had before they got to Big Spring : a full bladder , pure and simple . She was at once less perturbed , thinking he would mention it when they came to the next town ; but in time they came to the next town , Midland , and passed through it , and  | Peewee did n't mention stopping . Jim had begun to chat with him , quizzing him about rodeo and rodeo people , and Peewee answered lengthily and fidgeted and looked stoically out the window . Patsy grew worried , then annoyed . He was plainly not going to do anything to interrupt Jim 's ridiculous schedule , even if his bladder burst , and it probably would if something were n't done , for there was no telling how far Jim would drive before he stopped again . If they got beyond Pecos without stopping , Peewee was doomed . The longer she thought about it the more annoyed she became . There she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bladder . It was ridiculous . But when she looked at Peewee she found she could not be angry at him . He was obviously a person who would never amount to anything , and who knew it , and who had only his friendliness with which to face the world . The way he tried not to look at her too much flattered her and made her feel nervous and strangely powerful . He was probably only keeping quiet about his bladder through fear of offending her . She began to feel responsible for him . to was a child in her keeping , virtually . Jim was the one who was infuriating , for he should have anticipated the problem , or asked Peewee , or simply stopped himself , through common consideration . Ile was very insensitive . He had no awareness whatever of other people 's bladders . It had been all she could do to get him to stop for her own . She grew more and more fretful and squirmed a bit herself . It had been a fine cool morning , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless drive , and the cheese crisps and the Coke had been exactly what she wanted for breakfast , and Peewee had been a nice surprise  --  up until the time when he needed to pee . But it was all getting spoiled . She grew angry at Peewee too . If he did n't have gumption enough to speak up , he deserved to suffer . Then they reached Odessa , passed the first stations , and he was still silent . Patsy abruptly decided to act . She was tired of suffering the thought of him suffering . " Pull into that station , please , " she said , pointing dictatorially . " Why ? " Jim asked , surprised . " We just stopped in Big Spring . " Patsy had put on her shades , and she looked at him imperiously from behind them . " True , " she said . " We stopped in Big Spring . Would you mind stopping again please ? I have to do something . " Her tone left him no choice , so he braked hastily and swerved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strode to the rest room . The service station men looked at her hostilely when they saw they did not intend to buy gas . She waited in the rest room a minute , her bosom heaving with annoyance . Peewee 's boots tapped by and in time there was the sound of a toilet flushing from the other rest room . Then the boots went back to the car . She waited another minute and went back too , her head down . Jim was drumming his fingers on the wheel . In the back seat Peewee looked content and comfortable and grateful , but she wanted none of his gratitude . " Thank you very much , " she said to Jim . " I hope this excessive stopping has n't destroyed your career . " " Used to like outside Odessa , " Peewee said . " Nice little town . " Patsy ignored his cheerfulness and Jim 's silent , somewhat quizzical annoyance and turned and bent over the back seat to fish in the box of paperbacks . She fished out A Charmed Life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peewee was looking at the books curiously . When she bent over to reach down into the box he had not been able to help looking down her blouse . All he had seen was the strap of her bra and the hollow of her shoulder , but it was the kind of glimpse that was infinitely tantalizing , and he quickly looked at the books in order to cover himself . There were a great many books , it seemed to him . He picked one off the top and stared at it with surprise . It was called The Decipherment of Linear-B . He had never seen a book with such a title , and he stared at it silently . Patsy looked back at him again , still stern , but her sternness soon broke down . Peewee pushed his hat back on his head and stared at the book with innocent fascination , as if it were an unknown species of lizard . He looked so stunned and funny that she immediately remembered he was a child in her care and forgave him his modest reticence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt slightly flushed . " Read that ? " she asked , grinning merrily again . " Read it ? " Peewee grinned too and grunted a little , pleased that she was friendly again . " No , ma'am , " he said . " Now look , call me Patsy . If you 'll call me Patsy we can be friends and talk about literature . " " You read many Westerns ? " Peewee asked , determined to do his best .  | " Not many . I read Destry Rides Again when I was a little girl . re there many good ones ? " " Uum , " Peewee said . He was still looking askance at The Deipherment of Linear-B and glanced in the box of books as if he had suddenly discovered he was sitting next to an unknown mineral t hat might well give him radiation burns . " I do n't reckon there are many good ones , " he said humbly . " I mean , they 're mostly the kind of books I read . Westerns . If you read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you probably would n't never think a Western was no good . " " I do n't know . I like all kinds of books . " " Why would there need to be something like this here ? " he asked , laying the book carefully back in the box . " It makes me glad I quit school when I did . I ai n't got the brain power for such as that . " Patsy started trying to tell him what it was about , but she had n't read it herself  --  it was a relic of Jim 's flirtation with linguistics  --  and Peewee looked at her so raptly that it annoyed her a little . She soon broke off her lecture . It had grown hot and they all three gave themselves up to the boredom of a long desert drive . They lunched on hamburgers and shakes under the worn green awning of a drive-in in Pecos , and edged on west through the afternoon . Patsy read idly in A Charmed Life , stopping from time to time to look out the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacations of childhood . Every other year her parents would decide to go west and would bundle her and her sister Miri into a Cadillac and spend two or three weeks hurrying between scenic spots while the girls read comic books or Nancy Drew mysteries and waited irritably for the Grand Canyon or some other redeeming wonder to appear . As the sun sank , it shone more hotly into the front seat , and Patsy slipped for a while into a sweaty doze . When she awoke she had a momentary sense of bewilderment and disorientation . It seemed strange that she should be in such barren gray country . If she had tiny sense , she reflected , she would be in a cool bed in Connecticut , having a tremendous love affair with someone sensitive  --  someone who would never be likely to have anything to do with Texas , New Mexico , or Arizona . But then Jim smiled at her fondly and she realized that such a fantasy was even more unreal than the locale  --  it was not her at all . She felt sweaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do .  | " Could n't we just stop in El Paso for the night ? " she asked . Jim looked slightly weary but shook his head . " Peewee needs to be there in the morning to get entered , " he said . She glanced around at Peewee and found that he had been exploring in the paperbacks again and had come up with Sexus  --  a fat red paperback and one of Jim 's recent purchases . She had n't read it and was n't especially eager to , but it was obvious that Peewee had never read anything like it in his life . He was holding the book about four inches in front of his eyes and seemed to have stopped breathing . " You 're getting ahead of me , " she said . " I have n't read that one . Is it pretty sexy ? " Peewee was stunned . When he opened the book he had forgotten everything . He had a terrific erection and when he saw Patsy looking at him he became horribly embarrassed , for he was sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once and tried to look out the window as if nothing had been happening , but his throat was dry and he had a hard time breathing . " Uh , yes ma'am , it 's kinda racy , " he said . " Patsy . Not ma'am . " " Oh , " he said . " Patsy . " She felt cramped and sat with her back against her door , her legs on the seat , the soles of her feet pressed against Jim 's leg . There was nothing to do but watch the distances , gray and wavery with heat , and so endless . " God , " she said . " I had forgotten this desert . Could n't I just fly from El Paso and meet you gentlemen in Phoenix ? " " Sure , " Jim said . " No problem about that . We can drop you at the airport as we go through . You 'll have to change clothes , though . We 'll find a station . " But when they arrived in El Paso three hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly , she shook her head . She did not like to do things alone , and it made her feel a little low to think that Jim was so obligingly going to let her fly . Another four hundred miles of desert with Jim and Peewee was a lot better than a pointless night alone in some motel in Phoenix . " You would just put me on a plane , would n't you ? " she said . " Why not ? You 're grown . You have a right to fly to Phoenix if you 'd rather . I know it 's boring poking along in this car . "  | " You 're just glad to get rid of me because my rest room habits are n't to your liking , " she said sulkily , looking at the bare brown mountains behind the town . " Somehow I 've been offended . Probably if I went on a plane you and Peewee would scoot right over to Juarez and carry on with women of the night . I know your types . Marriage vows mean nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked back at him sternly and he shut his mouth . He decided he had made some horrible mistake . He should not have let her see him reading that book . ( ' Icarly she had figured out that he had had a hard-on . Jim was in traffic , an annoyance after the open desert , and he was not at all impressed with Patsy 's shift of mood . " Oh , for shit 's sake , " he said . " You 're ridiculous . You brought up the airplane . I would n't go to Juarez and you know it . " But it had crossed his mind that if Patsy flew , he and Peewee might make Juarez for an hour , to rest themselves from the road . Late afternoon depression fell on Patsy like a hot quilt and she kit ready to cry . " Do n't say things like that to me , " she said . " I 'm sure they embarrass Peewee . You do n't love me . All you do is yell excretory words at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my youth . " Tears ran out from under her sunglasses and she wiped them on her palms . " If you do n't go to Juarez it 's because you 're chicken , " she said . " Any man in his right mind would dash right to Juarez the minute he got rid of me . You 're both men of no spirit . Stop at that drugstore . " She grabbed her purse and went running into the drugstore cryg , and Jim sat nervously at the wheel and tried to explain to PeeWee that it was probably nothing serious , just one of Patsy 's little its of depression . Peewee was terribly worried and nervous and had already decided never to accept another blind ride involving a wife . He racked his brain for some excuse that would allow him to get out and hitchhike to Phoenix . Patsy was beautiful but altogether too scary . " Do n't look so worried , " Jim said . " She does this sort of thing all the time . She 'll calm down . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Peewee said . " That 's what 's got me worried . " Patsy came striding back out of the drugstore carrying a number  | of boxes of Kleenex in her arms . She dumped them on top of the paperbacks , glowered briefly at Peewee , and sat down . " Drive on , you wretch , " she said . " I 've decided to accompany you , even though I 'm not wanted . Wither thou goest I might as well go . At least I 've got some Kleenex now . I intend to cry a lot . " " You 'll go , but you 'll bitch about it , " Jim said , driving on . " I 'll bitch if I feel like it , of course , " she said . " Have you ever been married , Peewee ? " " Me ? " Peewee asked . " Who would marry me ? " He said it so simply , with no trace of self-pity or melancholy , that it made Patsy stop feeling tense . There was always someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes with a Kleenex and smiled back at him , and he looked at her with bewilderment and relief . They were curving west out of El Paso , with the thin winding Rio Grande visible in the valley to the south . " Why , you look very eligible , " she said . " You could use a shirt that fits but other than that there 's no reason why you should n't get married and be as miserable as everyone else . " " All I can do to get a date oncet an ' a while , " he said , sure that he was being flattered . " What do you do when you are n't riding professional broncs ? " " This an ' that . Work in fillip ' stations . " The sun was lowering , dropping more rapidly toward a horizon far into New Mexico . The face of the great bare mountain to their right , El Capitan , was shining from the late sun , and the desert around them was cooler and more fragrant as the evening came . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I wonder what one would be like . " " You never ? " he said . " You do n't look like you have , now you mention it . They ai n't so bad , most of ' em . The best one I ever had was in Houston . " " Goodness . That 's where we live when we 're home . What did you do there ? " " Drove a little train . It 's over by the zoo , in Hermann Park . We lived in Houston a year . None of us ever liked the town much but I liked drivin ' that train . It just goes around the park , you know . " " I know . How strange . I ride it all the time , or every time I go to the zoo . Maybe I rode it while you were driving it . Would n't that be odd ? "  | " Shore would , " Peewee said , grinning at the thought . " We could n't take that humid weather so we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat in Las Cruces , " Jim said . Peewee 's talk of jobs made him strangely envious . All his jobs had been arranged by his father and had been with oil companies owned by his father 's friends . He had never felt that he could have gotten any of them if he had been applying strictly on his own merits . They ate in the coffee shop of a large new motel , with red leatherette booths and fancy trays of syrups and jellies on each table . The place had a large plate-glass window ; as they ate they watched the sun go down . Peewee had two cheeseburgers and Jim had a steak that was mostly gristle and Patsy had soup and a not-very-fresh salad and some rolls and butter ; her legs were chilled from the air conditioning . When they left , the gray horizon had turned purple . As they drove away from Las Cruces , darkness came across the desert to meet them . The afterglow faded , there were taillights ahead and headlights coming and a swish from cars they met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the huge trucks . Before they reached Deming both Patsy and Peewee had fallen asleep again , Patsy on her pillow , Peewee under his hat . Jim felt fresh and drove easily . After a bad stretch of dippy road they entered Arizona and he could drive faster . He could not see the scattered mountains , but he knew they were there . Patsy shivered . ! ! e rolled his window up and lost himself in fantasies of himself as photographer . For a time the road went through a valley , through little towns that were asleep and scarcely lit , and when he rolled his window down to freshen the air he smelled alfalfa fields . Once , just outside a little town , he saw some people walking on the shoulder , and he slowed and saw that they were Indian teenagers walking home from somewhere . The boys were fat and wore cowboy hats , and the girls wore sweaters and clumped together . Off the roads he yaw lights , but very low to the ground , as if they came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gentle slope . Except for the teenagers , it was a little like being in the Old West for a moment , the scout slipping past the Indian encampment . The strange low lights were eerily beautiful , in contrast to the teenagers , who ere eating Popsicles and throwing the wrappers on the ground . He had driven over six hundred miles and , except for an interval or two , had not felt tired , but not long after he passed the teenagers  | an unshakable fatigue hit him , and hit him very quickly . It tugged at his eyelids , slowed his feet on the pedals , made the roadway seem very familiar and his own speed quite natural and safe . He knew how such tiredness worked , and the second time he nodded and jerked awake he slowed and eased down a steep shoulder to park on a level place by a barbed-wire fence . He pulled a jacket and a cotton blanket out of the heap of clothes in the back seat , spread the blanket over Patsy , covered himself with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little more than an hour he awoke and got out of the car to piss . He was stiff and cold and felt like driving on . The moon had risen over the valley and the clear desert sky was pale . In the moonlight he could see the dark bulks of mountains across the valley to the north . When he started the Ford and drove up the slope of shoulder Patsy almost slid onto the floor , and the blanket slipped off her . She woke up and looked about in bewilderment . " Dumb fool , " she said vaguely and then scooted over by him and cuddled against his shoulder . It was quite cold . She turned around and fished in the clothes until she found a red cashmere sweater of his that she liked to wear . She tugged it on and snuggled against him again , nuzzling her face beneath his arm , almost into his armpit . " What 's the appeal of my armpit ? " " Warmth , " Patsy said . " My nose is cold . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against his shoulder , silent but friendly . When they curved up into the Superstition Mountains Jim slowed down and drove carefully , not fully trusting his reflexes . Patsy was still awake when they dropped into the flat desert east of Phoenix and saw the lights of the city brightening the sky . " Please get a place with a swimming pool , " she said meekly . " If I 'm going to have to sit around all day by myself I want something to dip my toes into . It wo n't cost much . " " You deserve that much , " he said . There were times when it was necessary for him to pretend he did n't have almost a million dollars of his own , and it was one such time . He pulled into a station to gas up and get a city map . Patsy got out and stretched and took a quick walk around the block , although it was almost two A.M. The air was cold and the dark sky very liquid . The sweater felt good ; her legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the station he saw Peewee standing at the curb looking down the wide empty street . He had his rigging and his canvas traveling bag and had tucked his shirttail in neatly . When he saw her coming he began to kick his bootheel against the curb . " Where in the world are you going ? " she asked . " Might as well hitchhike on out to the grounds , " he said . " Ai n't no use in you-all going out of your way . I sure am much obliged for the ride . Hope I get to see you agin while we 're here . " " Of course you will , " she said . " Do n't be so humble . Will anyone give you a ride this time of night ? " " Somebody 'll come along , " he said . " Always have . " " He insisted , " Jim said when she was back in the car . " You scared him back there in El Paso . " " How could I have scared him ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They drove down Broadway , the wide main street , rejecting block after block of palatial motels and settling finally on a modest stucco court with a small swimming pool . The manager had gone to bed , but cheerfully got up to register Jim . Patsy got out and walked across the gravel drive to stand by the water , which was bluish and lit by only two small lights . There was an old pool umbrella with five or six iron chairs grouped around it . The room was modest and also poorly lit . The green bedspread depressed her and the green tile in the bathroom depressed her more . But whenever he was starting a new enterprise , Jim would have them poor for a time , and there was nothing to do but make the best of it . It was his one inflexible policy . Just as her spirits were sinking she caught an abrupt glimpse of herself in the bathroom mirror and pulled them up again . For a girl who had just traveled seven hundred and some miles , she looked okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get her purse and her suitcase , determined that no cheap motel was going to control her spirits . " Whee , we 're starting a new life , " she said cheerfully when she came back in . Jim was yawning , more tired than he would admit . lie had brought only his cameras in . Without answering , he went hack out to lock the car , and Patsy went in the bathroom to test the hot water . All the same , the life did n't feel so new . She made the shower drip and held her hand under the drip until the water got hot , wishing there was a bathtub . Behind her she heard the springs  | of the bed give as her tired husband sank upon it , and when she went in to get her gown he was asleep , the bed light right in his eyes . Some new life , she thought , but then he had driven all that way without any help and with her bitching at him , and she went over and took off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to take her shower . PATSY SAT at the narrow little dressing table in the motel room , unhurriedly arranging her hair . The table had been designed to be a desk and a dresser both , and was not adequate to either purpose . It had a sheet of glass on top , under which was a map of a sort , showing all the spots of historical interest around Phoenix . The mirror was old and oval . Patsy lifted her hair , trying to imagine how she would look if it were long enough to be arranged in coils . Often she sat in front of mirrors for some time contemplating herself as she might be if she looked otherwise . She was far from indifferent to her looks , but on the whole she was content with them and felt no urgent need to make radical changes . She lingered at the dressing table because she found dressing tables nice places to meditate . When it came time to go someplace she could always be ready in six minutes . In the end she seldom did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to her eyes . Jim was sitting impatiently on the bed watching her . He had his cameras and equipment bag ready and was merely waiting for it to be time to leave . Patsy had decided to skip the rodeo and go to a movie , and he was rather glad  --  if she had gone to the rodeo he would have felt responsible for her boredom . She had on her gray sleeveless dress and when she raised her arms to rearrange her hair the lift of her bosom made him feel sexy . He had slept most of the day while she had idled by the swimming pool reading and writing lengthy letters to her sister Miri and her friend Emma Horton . She was a happy idler  --  she loved to write long letters and sit by swimming pools , occasionally in the sun but more often in the shade . She never had been able to tan successfully  --  her shoulders and legs merely reddened . As Jim watched her contentedly turning her head one way and  | another he became more and more horny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , kissing her , taking her to bed . She could usually be taken to bed , even if she had been planning on a movie ; she cared more about impulse than she cared about plans . He cared about plans , though , and he had been planning to get some pictures taken . If they made love he probably would n't even get to the rodeo that night . Given any sort of chance , Patsy would loll in bed for hours and would want him to talk to her , and he would get lazy and not go . He knew his laziness problem and was determined to get on top of it . The thing that complicated such decisions the most was his knowledge that if he did go sweeping over and make love to her it probably would n't be all too satisfying , anyway . Patsy liked for him to make love to her  --  at least she liked it okay , but she did n't like it as much as he would have liked her to . It just did n't seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and though she was not critical of him particularly , he frequently felt that it was his fault that their transports were not more intense . If he made love to her and it worked out badly he would feel all the more that he ought to have gone to the rodeo and done his work . So , instead of going over and grabbing her he played out his desire in fantasy as he sat on the bed , and in fantasy it turned out a lot more gracefully and powerfully than it usually turned out in fact . " I guess I 'm ready , " Patsy said , standing up and putting her comb in her purse . " I 've got about thirty minutes to make the feature . " Jim stood up too and managed to focus on the cool ready-togo-out Patsy standing before him instead of the naked responsive Patsy in his mind . She got a sweater , in case the theater should be too air-conditioned , and found her car keys . She was going to drop him at the rodeo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand and gave her directions politely , but he was still horny and irritated with himself . " I love these wide streets , " she said . " The nice thing about the West is all the space . " " It would n't be so nice if you had to live in the middle of it . " Soon they saw the arena lights , with the sky behind them black and starless . There was a solid line of traffic . Patsy inched along irritably , tapping her fingernails on the wheel and compressing her  | lips with annoyance when a woman in a white station wagon stopped just in front of her and let two little boys out . Jim got out at the contestants ' gate , got his cameras from the back seat , and leaned across the seat to kiss her . She was in the process of taking off her sunglasses , and the kiss got tangled in fingers and frames . " Do n't get yourself trampled , " she said . He hung the cameras around his neck and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A riding club was lined up . Women in tight pants that made their abdomens bulge grotesquely clutched their saddle horns nervously . They obviously never rode except on the first nights of rodeos and strove desperately to keep their spotless hats on and their horses in place . Some of them looked so incongruous that Jim wanted pictures of them , but he had not yet learned to take pictures unobtrusively and was nervous about taking any . Despite his Levi 's and boots he himself felt incongruous ? he no more belonged to the scene than the ladies on the horses . He felt almost as hopeless at photography as they were at horsemanship and wished for a moment that he had simply gone to the movie with Patsy . He went up into the grandstand , but he stayed only a few minutes and took no pictures . The stands were a confusion of children , pillows , people in satin shirts , dropped programs , and Sno-cone vendors , and the aisles were already littered with popcorn sacks and paper cups . He went from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him no mind at all . One tall man had his shirt off and was getting his shoulder bandaged . There was a smell of dust and horseshit , and the man who was being bandaged grunted almost as loudly as the broncs that were being cinched . He heard Sonny Shanks 's name called and looked up to see Sonny sitting above chute three , bareheaded and in a bright yellow shirt . A heavyset cowboy reached up and handed him some money without a word and Sonny grinned and folded it carefully before stuffing it in his pants pocket . He wore black chaps and seemed without a care . When he saw Jim shooting pictures he nodded and gave a friendly wave . Peewee appeared and was as glad to see Jim as Jim was to see him . " I would take you round but I got to help hustle the ridin ' stock , " he said . He wore the same clothes he had worn yesterday , but they were considerably dustier.  | Jim found a place on the fence and watched the bareback riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two young cowboys standing nearby thought so . " I guess he 's living proof that no amount of pussy can hurt a man , " one said . Instead of thinking of pictures , Jim found himself thinking of Patsy . He seldom photographed her  --  somehow it made them both self-conscious . He pictured her in his mind , sitting in the movie with a sweater over her shoulders . Her shoulders were lovely . Once before they were married they had gone in the evening to Fair Park , in Dallas , and sat on the grass by a little lake , eating fried chicken from a box . Patsy had worn a white dress with narrow straps , so that her arms and shoulders and neck were almost bare . She ate the hot chicken and wiped her fingers on the grass and talked about an I ngmar Bergman movie they had seen the night before , her voice soft and quick . Jim sank easily and sometimes quite deliberately into reverie . As he was thinking of Patsy he was almost knocked off the fence by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard hoofs and snorting breath and looked down to see a yellow bronc charging straight up the fence line . The cowboys along the fence scattered upward before the bronc like grasshoppers before a mowing machine . Jim got down and wandered to the stockpens to stare at the big lazy-looking bulls for a while . Three young would-be bull riders were looking at them too , one of them talking of how much he missed Idaho . When Jim got back to the arena the barrel racing had just begun . The first girl out was fat and a little scared . She let her horse go so wide on the second barrel that he almost touched the fence where Jim was standing . The second contestant was a woman in her thirties . She came out very fast on a well-trained gray horse , cut the barrels coolly and professionally , no more than a foot of space between the barrel and the horse 's body , and quirted the gray out of the arena in a time of twenty-one seconds . The crowd seemed to think that very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead run . She was bareheaded , her hair bleached white . She charged down on the first barrel so recklessly fast that the crowd shushed completely and then roared when her Appaloosa came out of the turn safely , almost on his knees . The second barrel was harder . The girl rode almost straight at it , keeping the horse at full speed until she was only a few yards away . Then she swung right to  | clear the barrel and sharply left to round it ; but the horse had too much speed . The girl was up and forward in her stirrups , and when the horse tried to whip out of the turn his forefeet slipped and he went down , still straining forward . The girl was thrown clear and hit the ground several feet from the horse , right in front of Jim . He and three cowboys immediately jumped the fence , thinking she was hurt , but the girl got up and shook her head rapidly , flinging tears out of her eyes . " My stupid fault , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and tried to put his arm around her , but she hit her fist against her thigh and stepped away . Still sobbing , she got her horse and began to lead him out of the arena . " Well , bad luck , " the clown said , shaking his head in discouragement . Then he looked at Jim and seemed to recognize him . " Oh , hi , " he said . " We met in Merkel , only you was knocked out at the time . I 'm Pete Tatum . " " Sure , " Jim said , shaking hands . " You saved my cameras . " They followed Boots and her horse down the fence line , and a girl in a pink suit dashed into the arena , overshot a barrel , and lost her hat . By the time they were out of the arena Boots 's disappointment had subsided enough that she let Pete put his arm around her and soothe her and hug her a bit . Jim stood back awkwardly , not sure whether to leave or stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Aw , you will . Let 's all go to the trailer and have a quick beer . I ai n't busy till calf-scramble time . " On their way to the trailer they passed Shanks 's hearse and saw him sitting on the back end of it , one leg out of his Levi 's , trying to wrap an elastic bandage around his knee . He had a bandage on his hand too , and it gave him trouble wrapping the knee . He had one end of the elastic in his teeth . He glanced up and saw them passing and immediately let that end go . " Hey , Boots , " he said . " Come wrap this thing for me . I ai n't got enough hands . " Pete went over to the hearse , took the wrap off , and expertly rewound it on Sonny 's knee . " Tighter , " Sonny said . " Not tighter unless you want gangrene . That ai n't the first knee I 've ever wrapped . " Sonny nodded at Jim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked .  | " She 's fine . " Boots ignored Sonny entirely and walked on off , leading her Appaloosa . When Pete was finished with the support , Shanks slipped his leg back in his pants and began to tuck in his shirttail . " You-all come to the party tomorrow night , " he said to Jim . " My place , at the Ramada . You can come too , Peter , if you bring your girl friend . You ai n't much fun stag . " " I got to train my mule tomorrow night , " Pete said , walking off . " See if you can train him to fuck , " Sonny said , grinning at Jim . " A fucking mule is what the circuit needs . " Jim promised to be at the party and followed Pete to the trailer house . Boots was sitting on the steps and had a can of beer for each of them between her legs . She sipped at hers , and Pete stood with one hand on his hip , draining his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trailer and reached down to hold Boots 's head against his leg for a minute . " I got to be goin ' , " he said . " Come on , shake off that fall . Everybody in rodeo falls sooner or later . See you , Jim . " He left . His attempt to cheer Boots up had not worked . She still looked very disconsolate . " We 're going to get married next week , " she said . " That 's why Pete acted embarrassed . He thinks he 's too old for me . " Jim squatted down so he could see her better . Her nose was a little too blunt but otherwise she was pretty , in an open , energetic , unself-conscious way . Her straight white hair framed her face nicely . He found her immediately likable and was glad to be relieved of the necessity to be a photographer every minute . " How long have you been married ? " she asked . " A year and a half . " " I wish we had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Pete and I have been married ten years . Then we wo n't have any problems like this . " Jim was a little surprised . He thought she was sad about her fall , not about her marriage . He looked around for a place to put his empty beer can . Throwing things on the ground seemed sloppy to him , and he was always trying to break Patsy of the habit . " Oh , just pitch it under the trailer , " Boots said . " It gets messy around a rodeo whatever you do . That 's one thing I like about it . I 've always been messy . " It was really a one-man trailer , and so small that Jim could  | scarcely imagine how two people could even get in it , much less live in it ; but its smallness and simplicity appealed to him . He loved the thought of being able to live on next to nothing  --  on the bare essentials . In his imagination he often stripped his life of all extras , all luxuries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have persuaded her to live in the largest trailer ever made . In Houston they had the whole top floor of a large three-car garage , and she was not content even with that . She wanted a house and had threatened to buy one with her own money  --  she had just about enough . It was insane ; she did n't particularly want to live in Houston , but she continually complained about not having a house , and he could never be quite sure she would n't just go out some morning and buy one . The value of keeping stripped down to essentials was lost on her , and his attempts to explain it did not impress her . When he quoted Thoreau she yawned . Boots was clearly more amenable to the simple life than Patsy would ever be . " It 's tiny , all right , " she said , noticing that he was looking at the trailer . She giggled a little and looked happier . " Pete keeps talking about trading it in on a Volkswagen , so we 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up getting a station wagon . " " You ought to get a hearse , like Sonny has . " " He 'd kill us . Us or anybody else who gets one . He 's as proud of that hearse as he is of his dong . Want the rest of my beer ? I feel like I may throw up . I get so excited running the barrels that I 'm always throwing up . " Jim would have liked to talk longer , but she did look a little drawn . He stood up and said he had to go . Except for Peewee she was the only rodeo person he had met that he really liked to talk to . He was a little intrigued by girls who came right out with words like screw and dong . Patsy was more inhibited than he felt she ought to be where talk of sex was concerned . " Bring your wife by tomorrow , " Boots said . " I 'd love to meet her . " Jim said he would . When he left , Boots went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then went out and began to unsaddle the Appaloosa , whose name was Sprinkles . The dachshund had been run over the week before . She missed him , and now she laid her cheek against the horse 's neck . " It was n't your fault , sweet thing , " she said . " It was all my fault . "  | PATSY HAD GONE to see Lolita and was delighted with it . For some reason she had missed the film when it first came out , though she had read the book three times and thought it beautiful . James Mason had been a perfect Humbert Humbert too . Still , the movie left her annoyed  --  vaguely annoyed . The Ford was in a parking lot only a block from the theater , and as she walked down the wide sidewalk by the even wider street she tried to put her finger on what had bothered her . She passed a shop that seemed to sell nothing but sunglasses ; there were hundreds in the window , with all sorts of strange frames , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reserve , she stopped and peered in the window . A carload of boys passed in the street and let out a chorus of whistles . Alarmed for a second , she turned and looked . There were five of them in a new convertible , soldiers probably , all of them wearing the gaudy short-sleeved sports shirts that soldiers seemed to adopt for their nights on the town . When she looked at them they cheered and whistled and made it obvious they thought she was luscious , but they also seemed inoffensive and even a little shy , and they moved rapidly on down the street . Normally , being whistled at embarrassed her , but this time it perked her a bit instead . As she walked on to the parking lot she reflected on the movie and decided that one reason she was annoyed by it was because she had been no nymphet herself , no Lolita , when she was that age . She had been thin and inhibited and had had no bosom at all and , as well as she could remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting a respectable number of dates , but that was because she had always been pretty in the face , as the saying was in Texas . She would certainly not have attracted a Humbert Humbert , and except for one occasion when a boy had bumped his penis against her hand nothing memorably lascivious had happened on any of the dates . The movie left her all the more convinced that as a teenager she had been a complete stick-in-the-mud . The question was , had she really changed ? She had grown prettier , and had more bosom , and thought of herself as knowing the  | facts of life , but she was still not convinced that she was all a woman ought to be . She had always wanted to be beautiful and had always been slightly contemptuous of girls who just wanted to be sexy , but being sexy had begun to seem more important to her or , at least , important in a different way . Jim was not much help . It was a vague problem and he was vague himself half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , but that fact alone never seemed too convincing . His life , so far as she could tell , was one great interlocking structure of fantasies involving himself , and it was probably just necessary to the overall fantasy for him to think of her as sexy . In a way , being whistled at by a earful of boys was more convincing than Jim 's attentions . At least the soldiers were something objective . She started the Ford and drove slowly out Broadway , looking a little wistfully at the giant motels . Probably it was vulgar , a streak of Aunt Dixie in her , but she would much rather have been at a giant motel . She liked carpets and big bathtubs and good coffee shops and huge well-lit pools and television sets so there would be movies to watch at night . There would probably even be interesting people at a big motel . The only interesting person in theirs was a long-retired minor actor . He had a grenadier mustache , a chubby talkative wife , and a magnificent white Afghan so aristocratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kennel . Around the pools of the big motels there were people sitting and drinking , some even swimming , though the night was cool . Patsy would have liked to be among them , and she felt a flash of annoyance at Jim . It was unfair , because if they had been at a big motel she would probably have been inside reading , but it was a strong annoyance , nonetheless . She had money and was glad of it and he had many times as much and his attitude toward it had been the cause of many fights , all of which she lost . From time to time he insisted on pretending they were poor , driven to earning their living from month to month , and when he set a budget at such times nothing could make him exceed it . Patsy pointed out in the wittiest possible terms that such budgets were ridiculous , but of all his fantasies the poverty fantasy was the one he was stubbornest about , and he never gave a foot of ground . She pulled into the motel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been passing , theirs seemed a small and uninviting fishpond . The old actor and his wife were just returning from walking  | the Afghan and said hello to her pleasantly . She felt depressed the minute she stepped into the room . The small room , the bare floor , the poor light , all seemed so confining in contrast to the wide streets and deep sky outside ; and to make matters worse , Jim was already back . He sat on the floor with his shirt off , happily engaged in his favorite task , which was the rearranging of his files . She had seen it coming that afternoon when he had lugged the two small green cases of files in from the car . All of the hundreds of pictures he had managed to take were in piles on the floor , along with several stacks of folders , manila envelopes , pencils , felt pens , paper clips , and tabs of various kinds . He had even bought a bottle of bourbon ? a pure affectation , it seemed to her  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his leg . " Hi , " he said , very cheerful . " Not much happening out there tonight so I thought I 'd come home and straighten this stuff out . We 're invited to a party tomorrow night . " " Ducky , " she said , unreasonably annoyed . He had barely glanced up , and the sight of the absorbed , contented way he piddled with the neat piles of pictures and neat stacks of envelopes sent her spirits straight down . He was sitting there dreaming of being Walker Evans or Cartier-Bresson or Ansel Adams , whatever kind of photographer he wanted to be for the moment , and it made her furious and also , somehow , scared . She felt like kicking the bourbon glass , or kicking the piles of pictures into complete disorder , and could hardly stop herself from doing it . Three months as a photographer and he was already arranging his own retrospective in his mind . Instead of kicking the pictures she tiptoed over them with exaggerated care , her lips compressed . If Jim had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he was looking instead at a picture of the marquee of an abandoned drive-in theater they had passed in Texas . The local kids had visited it one night and done their best to spell out an obscenity with the letters still left on the marquee . The best they could do was HORS SHIT . It was one of his favorite pictures . Patsy got her black bikini and a white terry-cloth robe and went to the bathroom and put on the bikini . Going back through the room , she took less care and one of her heels knocked a pile of pictures out of line . " Where are you going ? " Jim asked , surprised .  | " I 'm going to drown myself , " she said hotly . " I 'm feverish with envy because I do n't have a noble profession to practice , like you do . " " What ? " Jim said , puzzled . He had not really heard . The reverie he was enjoying had a strong hold on him , and he did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about something . She poised at the door , ready to argue if he wanted to argue , but when he looked down at the picture again she shut the door and strode angrily across the gravel driveway . The gravel hurt her bare feet , but not as much as she would have liked it to . She would have welcomed a flow of blood , either his or hers , but the only real pain was the pain at her breastbone , from the pressure of all her feelings . She sat down on the cold pool edge , let her feet into the water , and watched her own wavering reflection . The black of her suit and the white of her robe were plainer than her features or even her skin . After a minute she began to cry helplessly . Jim was doing everything over . When he had wanted to be a novelist he spent two months arranging for it . He bought an electric typewriter  --  it only took the notion of a new career to drive all thought of economy out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconsciously as if it were air  --  all kinds of paper of different colors and grades , dozens of pencils , standard pens and esoteric pens , a new dictionary and a fine desk lamp , lots of manila envelopes , and good editions of the best novels by forty or fifty masters of the novel . He even bought biographies of novelists and criticism of the novel . He wrote letters to twenty agents ( no replies ) , applied for three fellowships , wrote slightly more than one hundred pages of a book about growing up in Dallas , stopped one day to make notes , then instead of making notes began an elaborate chart of what was going to happen in the novel , improved on the chart and the notes for another month , and then began to spend his time in bars with fellow students while she read most of the novels he had bought . After he had bought all the pens , pencils , papers , dictionaries , directories , and guidebooks he could possibly need he stopped even piddling with the actual pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day , and decided he would rather be a linguist than a novelist . It was more his sort of thing , he felt : more exact , more precise . It took experience to make a novelist , but anyone with a good brain could become a linguist . Patsy agreed and was glad he  | had decided to change careers . During his last days as a novelist he had been very gloomy and hard to live with , and besides she had read the hundred pages of novel and had n't liked it much . Once the decision was made , she pitched in , helped him carry home books from the Rice library , applauded him when he tried to audit five language courses at once , and looked with interest into the grammars , dictionaries , journals , and books on linguistic theory that he ordered . The waiters at the local French restaurant smiled behind their menus when he tried to order in French , but Patsy did n't care . She got rather interested in Benjamin Lee Whorf herself and was happy at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after two months as a linguist , he bought a cheap camera to take snapshots with and within the next six weeks spent twelve hundred dollars on cameras and equipment and was thinking of setting himself up a darkroom . The way he meant to do it would combine writing and photography , he decided , and by the merest chance he got hot on cameras during the fortnight when the Houston rodeo was on . He went out to the stock barns , took a few pictures of the back ends of steers so pampered that their tails were kept in hairnets , and three days later decided they would spend the summer gathering pictures for a book on rodeo . It was only June , they were at their third rodeo , and Jim was already in the arranging phase and had n't taken more than ten pictures that she thought were worth looking at . She felt scared and had no idea what she would do . But almost as soon as she ceased crying , the depression left her . She wiped her face on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street , where there was a Pontiac agency with three gleaming cars spotlighted on the floor . She could be all wrong about it , she decided . Jim was smart and sensitive , perhaps he would become a good photographer . Perhaps he really needed to rearrange the files . Even if he did n't become a photographer he might hit on the field that suited him sooner or later . It was cowardly of her to become discouraged when he had had only three tries . It was all her own deficiency  --  she lacked faith in him . Even if he never found a field and just kept skipping from hobby to hobby , would that be so terrible ? What would it mean for them ? She did n't know , did n't know at all . Sighing , she slipped off her robe . She hated the sense that she was becoming neurotic , slipping off into gloomy vapors ; it was too silly  | and too self-pitying and she had nothing at all to pity herself for except that she wanted to have a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work itself out soon . When she was in such moods she longed for something to lift her out of them , some purely physical sensation : heat or cold , to dance , to eat . Beneath her was a literal swimming pool , full of cold water . Bracing her hands on the edge of the pool , she began to lower herself into it slowly , watching the water as it came up her white legs to her knees , her thighs , her hips . When her hips went under , the sluice of water over the bikini bottom was very chilling , and goose bumps came out all over her upper body . The waterline was just below her navel , and she stopped it there for a second , enjoying the sensation of cold even though she wanted to turn loose and swim to warm herself . It made her shiver . The bikini she had bought in Houston , on a whim . She had always been , if anything , an overly modest girl , given to one-piece suits all through high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a window in Westbury she had a sudden immodest desire to wear such a suit and had taken it right home and tried it on . It was clearly the sort of suit that went best with a tan , but still she liked it ; it made her feel loose and grown up in some way . Jim had been tremendously turned on by it and had tried to take her to bed while she was trying it on . It was a chink in the wall of her modesty , and he welcomed all chinks . Somehow the thought that it was the bikini that had prompted the seduction attempt had offended her slightly , and she put him off . When the cold water had driven all the gloom out of her head she turned and with her hands still on the edge of the pool lowered herself until the water came over her breasts ; then she shoved out into the pool and began to swim . For a few minutes she swam back and forth across the little pool in a vigorous but awkward crawl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good tennis coach as well , but she still swam awkwardly and played tennis so haphazardly that Jim had several times , in doubles matches , come close to pounding her with exasperation . She liked pools more than she liked swimming . By the time she had swum four or five lengths she was warm and stopped beneath the diving board to rest , breathing hard . She was not meant for exercise , she decided . As she was resting , Jim came out in his swimming trunks , an old pair of gray trunks that he had  | swiped from a gym class years before . She considered them as much an affectation as the bourbon , but she was in a more tolerant mood and watched him tiptoe across the gravel , a little glad that he had come to keep her company . When he got to the pool he jumped in feet first , came up , treaded water for a moment , and swam over to her in an even crawl . When he looked up , streams of water ran out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought you were going to drown yourself , " he said . He was in good spirits , and he was always sly at such times and infectious . " My bosom would n't let me sink , " she said . " Want to drive out into the desert and watch the sunrise ? It 's supposed to be great . " Jim ignored the question  --  it was his way of handling impulsive suggestions of hers that did n't appeal to him at all . Instead of answering he swam up to her , looked friendly , and began to kiss her . Kissing when their faces were both dripping wet was a bit of a novelty  --  it was slippery and his skin smelled differently and she compliantly kissed with him awhile , lightly and in fun , the water from her wet hair running off her eyelids and down her cheeks . She was holding on to the edge of the pool with her hands , her arms spread . Jim gradually began to kiss a little bit more than in fun . The bikini had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands on the pool side and wiggled between her legs , bumping at her suggestively while he treaded water . " Quit , " she said , not annoyed , but at the same time not wishing him to embark on any underwater gymnastics , none involving her , at any rate . She could tell from the bumps that he was feeling sexy and as usual that confused her a little , for while she was approving and a little glad she was also slightly reluctant . And anyway , cars were still passing on the street and the street was only yards away . And anyway , underwater sex was ridiculous even to think about , hut Jim had read pornography and thought everything ought to be tried . " Quit bumping me , please , " she said , putting a hand on his shoulder . " I would n't be seduced in a swimming pool even if it were anatomically feasible , and I have a hard enough time keeping this suit on without you bumping me . Just desist for a bit . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like to bump you . " Patsy put her legs around him and let him hold her up . She sank until only her head was out of the water , her eyes on a level with his 87  | chin . " You really do n't want to see the desert sunrise ? " she asked . " Perhaps we can make a trade , " he said , nudging her from below ; but it was the sort of remark that did n't work with her and she ignored it as blithely as he had ignored the original suggestion . " I saw the clown you like , " he said . " Met his wife , too . She 's a lot younger than him . They want us to come and see them tomorrow . " " Why not ? " she said , not very enthusiastic . She had all but forgotten Pete Tatum . He had been very nice , but the circumstances had been unusual and she had the feeling that under ordinary circumstances they would have little use for each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car without his shirt on as she had been leaving to drive to Abilene . There was no reason why she should have been embarrassed , but the memory of it lessened her enthusiasm for a visit . " His wife is a barrel racer . Boots is her name . She 's very friendly . Even you might like her . " " So I might , " Patsy said , still skeptical about Tatum . Names like Boots brought out the snob in her . Her chin was on the water and water got in her mouth . She tightened her legs around Jim to keep from slipping farther . Their loins were pressed together but in a position that was rather uncomfortable for both of them . Patsy unclasped her legs and ducked under his arm . " Damn it , I forgot a towel , and you did too , " she said . " I was angry with you when I came out here and you did n't even realize it . " But Jim had started swimming across the pool and did n't hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeating . She clung to the side , a little cold , contemplating a drippy dash to the bathroom . " No towels ? " Jim said when he swam back . " I 'll get some . He left a little trail of wet tracks across the gravel and came back with a large green towel . " Damn it , I dripped on some pictures , " he said . Later , after she had dried and gone in and sat in the small warm bathroom awhile filing her nails , and was stretched on the bed in her green nightgown turning through an issue of Vogue , Jim left his pictures and came silently to the bed and began to rub her back . The ends of her hair were still damp . He folded her hair into two parts and tucked it around her throat , so her shoulders and the back of her neck were bare . " If you 're through with your pictures turn off the overhead light , will you ? " she said . He did and came back and massaged her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiring of  | that , he began a little timidly to move his hands under the loose straps of the gown , down her rib cage and around toward her breasts . Patsy knew she was being caressed but felt a slight catch of stubbornness in herself and kept reading the Vogue with concentration for a few minutes , until Jim 's silent urging made her feel guilty . She turned on her side so he could reach a breast and then with a little excusing yawn dropped the Vogue off the bed and turned on her back acquiescently . She liked the way he massaged her neck and shoulders and had begun to feel genuinely acquiescent , but Jim did n't know it . He was never quite sure when she wanted him to go on and when she did n't . As it was , he felt his desire to be something of an intrusion and became hasty about it . " Hey , " Patsy said . She sat up , shrugged her gown off , and threw it on the floor with a quick gesture of resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the line of Patsy 's ribs as she stretched an arm to turn off the bed light . When she turned back to him in the sudden darkness he was not quite where she thought he was and their heads bumped . It took them a moment to realign their bodies . " I 'm sorry , " Jim said , though it was just a slight bump . Patsy was silent . It seemed always just at that moment , at the beginning of lovemaking , that she was most silent , most mysterious to him . At that moment he had no sense that he knew what she really wanted , or really liked , and she gave no clues at all . He could not even hear her breathing , and he felt , as he always felt , that he must hurry or she would cease to be interested  --  perhaps already had . So he did hurry , feeling himself an imposer until he reached a point where his own pleasure became stronger than any thought of Patsy . With his face close to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her breathe and knew that he was not imposing and moved at ease for a time . A faint light from the street came in through the window , enough so that when he raised up he could see Patsy 's face , her eyes closed and her face tensed a little , pleasantly . It made him feel very close to her . Things were going to be lovely for them both , finally . She was idly , unconsciously stroking his back with one hand and without meaning to stroked too low . It touched Jim too keenly , he was suddenly past waiting . He wanted not to be , but he was , it was too sharp . And when he was done coming , the sense of closeness he had felt for a moment was replaced almost immediately by a sense  | of disappointment , a feeling that was brother to his earlier feeling of awkwardness . It soon became kind of anger at Patsy , who was going on , moving very little but moving in her own deliberate way . He did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he rested , his face in her hair , merely staying put . As he waited , some of his irritation passed away , he all but forgot Patsy and was thinking of pictures and picture books when her pace increased suddenly and he found it hard to stay put . She put her legs over his and flexed so rapidly that he was afraid he would slip out , but after a moment of straining high against him , she came , her legs loosened , and he felt her fast hearbeat beneath him . Filled with affection then , she began to rub her face against his throat . Her hair still smelled faintly of swimming-pool water . Jim remained where he was , but his irritation came back , and became anger . It was a cheat , somehow , and it seemed to him Patsy 's fault ; after two years of making love with him , she ought to have quickened . He wanted her passionate at the beginning , not silent and quiet ; he wanted the affection and the nuzzling at the beginning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew if he spoke of it he would speak angrily , so he merely lay as he was , sullen , resentful , and wanting to scratch . Patsy knew he was not happy with her but tried not to know . Her pleasure had a short noon but a long evening if all went well ; and though she felt selfish for wanting the evening to linger she was greedy and did want it very much , and she put her hands on Jim 's hips to keep him where he was . She pressed him against her gently and appreciatively , but then for a moment felt briefly avid again and began to kiss his shoulders and rub her face against him . He did n't raise his face to her and her avidity quickly subsided . In a few minutes , without a word , Jim lifted himself off her and went through the dark to the bathroom . Patsy lay with her arms and legs spread , feeling sleepy , but when the shaft of light from the bathroom cut into the darkness it also cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled the sheet up over her modestly . Jim turned off the light and came back , and she got up , fumbled on the floor for her gown , and went to the bathroom too . He had n't spoken , and she felt lonely , as if she 'd done something very wrong and was being punished for it ; but she had begun to feel cold and stubborn too . In such a mood the bathroom light made life 90  | seem impossibly sloppy and dreary , and after flipping it on briefly she flipped it off again and made do in the dark . When she returned to the bed , Jim was awake but silent as a stone and she got carefully into her part of the bed , silent too and determined not to cry . She had forgotten both noon and evening and felt low . It was a cheat and it was his fault , for if he could bring himself to say two or three kind words or even give her an affectionate pat she could melt and love him again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would be like people were supposed to be after making love . But Jim said nothing and they each kept carefully to their separate sides of the bed , and though there was the mutual pretense that they were going to sleep , they were both wide awake and tight as wires . The bed was none too wide , but they were careful not to touch . Patsy 's urge to cry alternated with a terrible cold anger ; despite herself some tears leaked out and the anger spilled with them . " You have n't got a generous bone in your body , " she said , choking . " You could say something . Even if you 're mad at me you could say something . I 'd rather you say you think I 'm awful than for you just to lie there waiting for me to break down . It 's just because you know I always break down , sooner or later . If you had any kindness you 'd speak to me . " " I speak to you lots of times , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the things she disliked most about him was that he was always sure of himself at such times , sure he had a right to be angry , while she herself was never sure of anything . " Not first , " she said . " You never speak to me first . You know I 'll cry when I 'm wretched enough and you wo n't say a thing to help me . You like for me to cry . " " Okay , I 'm sorry , " he said , not sorry at all . " There 's lots of favors you could do me too , if you wanted to . " " Oh , do n't sound like that , " Patsy said . " I hate you when you 're smug . What have you got to be so smug about ? Do n't you ever touch me again . " " Okay , " he said in the same firm tone . " I hope the next person I touch likes sex better than you do at least . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger hit her again . She sat up in bed , distraught , her eyes very wide . In all their arguments about it he had never said that .  | " If I do n't it 's because of you , " she said , and though she felt many angry words crowding into her head only those words came out . " Sure , sure , I know it 's all my fault , " he said , but his tone broke and his voice became ragged and hurt . Patsy was glad  --  it released more of her anger . " I 'm not a camera , you know , " she said . " You ca n't just click a few things on me at the right time and get a nice picture of yourself in action , or me in action , or whichever one of us you like looking at . " " I do n't click things , " he said , guilt taking the place of his own anger . He sounded even more hurt . " I love you , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't help it if it takes you six hours to come . It just makes me mad at you sometimes . I 'm sorry . " " Oh , please do n't exaggerate about it , " she said . " I did n't mean to say that , " he said , truly abashed . " It was just accidental hyperbole . I 'm sorry . " " Well do n't hyperbole about it , " she said . " I ca n't help it . If you want me to be different you have to figure out how to make me your own self . Only do n't let me see you clicking things , because then it does n't work . And speak to me , anyway , please , just speak to me , whether it works or not . I ca n't stand not being spoken to . " And with that the last anger washed out of her on a new burst of tears and she lay down and without another word snuggled close to him and cried , and he put his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears off her cheeks and apologized and told her he loved her and asked her not to cry . " Just speak to me next time , " she sobbed , and Jim said , " I will , I will . " After a while , lying against each other , they both relaxed . Jim quickly went to sleep , his arm across her , but Patsy lay awake for half an hour , feeling very dry and a little ashamed of herself . The quarrel would n't leave her mind . If such quarrels got worse , as they were said to , what would they do to each other when they were forty ? She slept for a few hours , but restlessly , not deeply , and awoke as the courtyard of the motel was turning gray . It occurred to her that there was no reason she could n't go and see the sunrise by herself . She got up , found a dress and her shoes , and combed her hair . When she slipped outside , Phoenix was gray and quiet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into the desert . Walking would 92  | be better . She set out down the wide cool street . The quarrel came back to her mind . She felt it had been her fault , she was not a very good wife really and did not try hard enough to be like he wanted her to be sexually . She always meant to try , but when the time came she forgot to until it was too late , and it was easy to forget because she did n't know very clearly what it was he did want . The filling stations were opening ; attendants in green uniforms played streams of water over the oily driveways . Patsy passed a drugstore and managed to extract a morning paper from a pile that had been tied with wire and left at the door . She had not brought her purse and had no way to pay for the paper , so she contented herself with scanning the headlines and looking at the movie ads . They would be there at least two more days and she was hoping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lolita was still the only good movie in town . She put the paper back and went on with her walk . Far down the street she saw cars with their headlights on coming into Phoenix , and when they passed her she saw that in almost every car only the driver was awake . A face or two peered out at her , sleepy and vague from a night of driving across the desert . The sky to the east had become rosy . She passed the filling station where they had let Peewee out and she found herself wondering about him . She had smitten him , she was sure , but would they ever see each other again ? She turned off the main street and walked a block or two to the east , curious to see what houses in Phoenix were like ; she found that they were not very interesting , not those near Broadway , at least . They were low houses , most of them , with sandy yards and a few dusty domesticated cacti on their porches . She soon lost interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the street , saw the sun come up  --  not over the desert exactly , but over the filling stations , the little houses , and the quiet motels . JIM EMERGED LATE that morning and found Patsy sitting by the pool in her bikini and the white robe , writing a long letter to Emma Horton , her one true friend . She seemed very cheerful and friendly , and he felt cheerful and friendly himself . 93  | Their quarrels seldom had a kickback , not even quarrels involving sex . Jim got his cameras and left for the rodeo grounds and when he looked back to wave goodbye he saw that Patsy was chatting happily with the actor 's fat wife , who was wearing a red bathing suit . A score or so of contestants and a few sweaty spectators were idling around the rodeo grounds , most of them under the grandstand in the shade . A cowboy was shoeing horses , there was a card game in progress  --  in which a saddle blanket served as a table  --  and several young men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flirting with some local cowgirls . Jim would have liked to photograph the card game , but one of the players gave him a surly look and he decided he had better find Peewee and get his opinion before doing anything rash . As he was walking toward the empty bucking chutes Sonny Shanks waved at him . He was standing in the sun , bareheaded , talking to three women . He wore a blue short-sleeved sports shirt , Levi 's , and a fancy pair of yellow boots . The women were all in their late thirties , bobby-pinned , bedraggled , and in pedal pushers . " A hot place to talk , " Jim said sincerely , after he had been introduced . " Oh , we 're talking about a hot subject , " Sonny said . " Sex-u-al intercourse , to be exact . " All the ladies abashedly looked down at the ground , and Jim did too , surprised . They seemed like honest lower-middle-class wives and mothers , not the types to be in that sort of conversation with Sonny in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borin ' , though , " Sonny said . " Boredom 's the root of all wickedness , way I heard it . " " It 's money that 's the root of all evil , " one of the women said , as if to remind him of an eternal law . " Now let 's get back to the point , " Sonny said , grinning at Jim . " If none of you ladies ai n't ever indulged with nobody except your husbands , how you know you 're gettin ' your dues ? Looks to me like you 'd need to make a comparison once in a while . " He gave them his most engaging grin . Two of the women giggled and looked at each other as if it were the most daring remark they had ever heard uttered . They appeared to give it some weight as argument too , but the third looked at Shanks belligerently . She was a tall rawboned , somewhat weathered brunette.  | " I ca n't speak for everybody but I do n't need no comparisons , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Shanks looked at her coolly . " The thing about me , I 'm willing to learn from anybody , " he said . " How does of Morris go about producing all them wonders ? " " You 'll have to ask him about that , " the woman said , not a bit flustered . " I sure ai n't fixin ' to tell you . " " You do look like you 've got some mileage on you , " Sonny said , winking at Jim . The women all looked astonished , as if some agreedupon bound had just been overstepped . They moved away together , each secretly vowing to make the others promise never to mention the conversation to anyone , though each of them reported it in detail to her husband that very night . " Take a ride with me , " Sonny said . " I got to collect a wager . " Jim went , fascinated . He decided at once that if he knew anyone with charisma , it was Sonny . It was no wonder the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making whatever he was doing seem interesting , and even his most casual gestures had a kind of authority . They went to a large motel nearby , but the cowboy Shanks was looking for was n't in . His room was unlocked and his television set was on but the room was empty  --  just a saddle propped against the wall and a few clothes strewn about . " He 's probably two doors down the way , " Sonny said , " puttin ' it to somebody 's old lady . Let 's give him ten minutes . " He took a rope off the saddle , propped the saddle on a chair , and sat on the bed cross-legged roping the saddle horn . He demonstrated a number of throws for Jim 's benefit . He never missed , and he never had to get off the bed to take the rope off . He flipped it off every time just before the loop closed . " I thought you were just a rider , " Jim said . " Oh , I am , " Sonny said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess I could have learned to rope if I 'd wanted to . Trouble with roping , it takes a horse , and then you 've got to haul the goddamn horse everywhere in the world . I 'd as soon have an anchor tied to me as a goddamn horse . " He stood up and quickly tied one end of the rope to the leg of the dresser and the other end to the bed and pulled the shades so the room was nearly dark . " Let 's go , " he said . " If he 's screwin ' somebody , he 's takin ' too  | goddamn long . You ca n't tell , the bastard might be in Canada , he ai n't got no sense . If he comes dragging in here drunk , maybe he 'll trip over this and break his neck . " They sped back to the rodeo grounds , Sonny silent and angry . He ignored traffic lights when it suited him to , but by the time they pulled back into the grounds he had recovered his good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rodeo life , " he said . " I do n't know what kind of woman would let that low-life son of a bitch screw her anyway . He reminded Jim again of the party , and let him out with a nod . Pete Tatum was leading his donkey past the gate and Jim hailed him . " Have you seen a guy named Peewee Raskin ? " he asked . " I do n't know if you know him . " " Hard to miss Peewee  --  but I ai n't seen him this morning . You hungry by any chance ? " It turned out that Boots was off with a girl friend eating Mexican food , and Pete was afoot and hungry . Jim was enthusiastic about taking him to eat . He felt he was learning the rodeo world fast . Without his makeup Pete 's face was rough , as if from many bumps and bruises , but confident and friendly . They went to a huge drive-in on the outskirts of Phoenix and ordered cheeseburgers and beer and ate rapidly . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food trays kept blowing across the concrete of the drive-in . As soon as they blew off the concrete they stuck to one or another of the many small cacti and flapped in the wind . For fifty or sixty yards to the north of the drive-in almost every cactus had a few ragged napkins stuck to it . The sight annoyed Jim . A desert of napkins and hamburger wrappers was very unpleasant to look at . " How 's picture takin ' ? " Pete asked in order to say something . Jim made him feel a little uncomfortable . Usually Pete made conversation easily with anyone , and yet he did n't know what to say to Jim . He was clearly a likable , pleasant young man  --  Pete liked him even without knowing him  --  but it was so obvious that Jim did n't know what he was doing that it made things a little awkward . He did n't even know how to pretend he knew what he was doing . He was young , so it was no crime . Pete had seen many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gave them a wide berth , even if he liked them  --  or especially if he liked them . Otherwise he made disciples and dependents that he did n't want .  | " I 'm none too expert yet , " Jim said . " I get some good pictures but I sure have n't learned to be unobtrusive . " " Yeah , I remember you obtruded a little too far , back there in Merkel . " " I still ca n't figure out why they hit me . I would have stopped i t ' they had asked me to . " " I would n't lose no sleep tryin ' to figure it out , " Pete said . " These boys ai n't the gentlest folk in the world . I wish I had a dollar for every fight I 've seen that there was n't no reason for . " On their way back they stopped at the motel for Jim to get a lens he had forgotten . Patsy was still by the pool , still in her bikini . She had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulders . " Want to come ? " Jim asked , not really supposing she would . But he caught her at a gregarious moment . " I guess so , " she said . " I was having a try at tanning , but it wo n't work . Are you just going to take Pete back ? " " Yeah , " Jim said , though he had really meant to take pictures . Patsy felt shy at the sight of Pete and went in and put on a beach robe over her suit . Pete got out so she could slide in next to Jim and she found that she was glad to see him . He seemed relaxed and approachable . " Hi , " she said . " How many cowboys have you saved from horns and hoofs since I saw you ? " Pete smiled and said he had n't kept count . Patsy discovered that she was sitting on a beer-can opener , part of which was wedged between the seats , part of which poked into her behind . She twisted around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the glove compartment . She was warm from the sun and smelled of suntan oil and the arm she stretched out was freckled a little above the wrist . Pete looked away from her , at the sun-whitened streets of Phoenix . Patsy 's arm , or her odor , or her black hair , or her smile , something about her reminded him too vividly of his first wife , whose name was Marie . He had loved her very much , and lost her very painfully . She too had freckled in the sun . When they pulled up at the trailer , Boots was sitting on the steps , barefooted and wearing Levi 's and an old gray shirt of his . She had just washed her hair and was letting the hot sun dry it . " Get out and have a beer with us , " Pete said . " I 'm too nearly naked , " Patsy said . " I 'd like to meet your wife ,  | though  --  I mean your wife-to-be . Maybe we could have the beer in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less roomy than the Ford , and she could not imagine the contortions that would be necessary for the four of them to crowd into it . Boots came over and got introduced and Pete went in and got the beer . When he came back Boots was in the car chattering rapidly . " You 're our first guests , " she said . " I do n't count rodeo people . They 're around so much it 's like brothers and sisters . " Patsy felt drawn to her at once , partly because she was so completely unpretentious and partly because she and Pete were just getting married . She was more comfortable with people who had not been married very long . She did n't really want the beer but sipped it politely , and some foam stuck to her upper lip . Being in company , even the company of two people , suddenly made her feel that she had been a recluse of late . She began to feel very sociable . " Look , " she said , acting on impulse , " why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's obvious that trailer house is too small for all of us . Why do n't we go back to our motel ? Nobody but us ever uses the pool . We can sit around the pool and you men can get potted if you want to . If " Great , " Boots said . " I love swimming pools . " Pete looked slightly uncomfortable about the invitation , but Boots did n't notice . " I ca n't do much boozin ' in the afternoon , " he said . " We might come over and take a dip with you afterwhile . " Patsy felt a little cast down , for she felt sociable at that instant and hated for the company to dissolve , but Pete was too firm a man to argue with . He added that he needed to work with his donkey awhile . Patsy would have liked to watch and regretted she had n't changed clothes . Sitting around a rodeo grounds in a bikini and a beach robe was out of the question . " Well , we 'll be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like it . " Boots waved her beer can at the Carpenters as they departed , and Pete pitched his under the trailer before following her inside . Once they were inside Boots turned to give him a light kiss and to her surprise found that he wanted her and wanted her at once . " My hair 's wet , honey , " she said , startled . " Well , you have to take the good with the bad on a honeymoon , " Iv. ; said with a wry grin . Her Levi 's were old , and so tight that he simply turned them  | wrong side out as he peeled them off . Boots had never known him to he so sudden about it , or so resolute . Throughout their courtship she had made most of the first moves , feeling that he would be ashamed to make them because she was so much younger . But for once he made the moves , and without hesitation . All she had to do was answer , never a difficult task for her . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shaking  --  someone might notice . Maybe that was why they had never done it in the daytime before . But the fact that Pete suddenly wanted her so much excited her past the point of caring about the trailer , or anything except what they were doing . " Oh , Pete , " she said , quickly caught . The hot afternoon sun came through the little window and made the sweat shine on their shoulders . She kept an arm crooked around Pete 's neck and went to sleep , the sheet beneath them cool with sweat . When he knew she was asleep , Pete moved and lay beside her and wiped his sweaty face on the end of the sheet . He felt swollen and moody . Instead of being rested , he felt restless , neither empty nor at peace . He loved Boots  --  he had only to glance at her sleeping face to know that  --  but he had come to her wanting someone else . Not Patsy  --  Marie , still Marie , whom Patsy had reminded him of . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill of her at all . In that regard , his only accomplishment in ten years was the acquired ability not to think about her often . He wanted to want Boots and Boots only . He was old enough to know that he was lucky in her , lucky to have a girl so easy , so open and so honest  --  lucky to have anyone who cared about him as unselfishly as she did . She wanted nothing better than to be in his keeping . And yet even Patsy had distracted him from her . Her chatter , her smell , the beer foam on her upper lip , her slim torso : no more than that and he had become , for a time , drawn away from Boots and had ruthlessly forced himself back . He looked down at his bride-to-be sleeping contentedly despite the heat , the sun on her shoulders and her small relaxed breasts . It made him sad , he felt confused  --  but at least she did n't . She had been purely pleased . For a few minutes he grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business had never been invented ; and then Boots woke up , her eyes shining when she looked at him , so cheerful and tender herself that he could not help but be glad after all that the whole business had been invented .  | She sat up and rubbed his belly fondly then flushed a little and shyly got up and squeezed into the tiny bathroom . In a minute she came back and sat on the bed to brush her hair , her face quiet and relaxed . " I guess we better start staying in motels , " she said . " The trailer was shaking . " " I never thought , " he said . " You really want to go swimming ? " " Sure . I like them . " But she put down her brush and stretched out beside him . " You do n't have a suit , do you ? " " I 'll just cut the legs out of some old Levi 's . " " I 'll do it for you , " she said , bouncing up again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She could n't find any scissors , and to Pete 's amusement cut the Levi 's with the shears he used to trim Hercules ' mane and tail . She kept cutting , trying to get the legs even , and soon little snips of denim covered the bed . Pete grew easy and drowsy and watched her with his eyes half shut . She was right . It was time to sell the trailer . THE CARPENTERS WENT BACK to the motel to await Boots and Pete , and as the afternoon lengthened and they did n't come Patsy grew terribly annoyed . She had wanted them to come right away , and when they did n't her sociable mood soured , her spirits dropped , and she soon reached a point where she did n't want them to come at all . " He 's no better than any other cowboy , " she said , moping . " I hate cowboys , clowns , rodeo , and the whole business of cowboyism . " " What 's cowboyism ? " Jim asked lightly . He was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases . " I beg your pardon ? " " For shit 's sake , " he said , though still lightly . " You hardly know them . They may not be great minds but they 're perfectly likable . Just because they did n't show up the minute you wanted them to , you make up some vague bitchy label that does n't really mean anything , even to you . Maybe they wanted to make love or something . Maybe he really did have to train his donkey . You told them to come any time , so what difference does it make ? " 100  | He was sitting with his back to her as he spoke , and Patsy considered his back gravely , wondering how it would really be to plunge a knife into someone 's back . But she knew that Jim was right : she was merely bored and being bitchy , and she did n't want a quarrel , at least not wholeheartedly . " So I 'm bitchy and smarty , " she said . " You have no right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was true  --  it was just fallibly put . I do like them . I 'm no snob . You 're the essence of vagueness yourself and you have no right to criticize my terminology . " Boodly-boodly , " Jim said . " I 'll criticize all I want to . " Patsy felt it was surely not possible for life to be any vaguer and duller than it was at moment . She lay on the bed with her chin on her wrists staring at the little brown dressing table . Through the open door of the bathroom she could see the white end of a motel towel that had been dropped in the shower . Jim had the annoying habit of drying himself while still in the bath or the shower , and he invariably got at least the ends of the towel wet , if not the whole towel . If he was going to go through life getting all their towels wet what was there to hope for ? " Feel like doing perversities ? " she asked with no change of tone . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Want to do what ? " " Perversities , " Patsy said . " Per as in persimmon , versities as in universities . You know , unconventional activities , like people do in pornography . " " Oh , " Jim said , sliding pictures into envelopes . " I do n't think you 're serious . " Patsy did n't answer . How could she blame him for dismissing the invitation ? They had only made love the night before and she had seldom been inclined again so soon . It embarrassed her a good deal even to have said what she said , because she had been more or less serious . While Jim was at the rodeo pens she had peeked into . Se.vus and it had affected her . If life was just going to be a matter of dullness and wet towels and waiting and reading , such things might be worth trying . She was in a mood to accept almost any diversion , and besides she was curious . For him to dismiss her so cursorily , without even glancing around , annoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to issue twice . " Why are you so completely vanilla ? " she asked . 101  | " Because that 's the way you want me , " he said , not turning around . " I did to begin with , but maybe I 'm changing , " she said . It was true that she had repulsed some experimental attempts on his part early on in their marriage , when she had been easily embarrassed , but it annoyed her that he thought her so static . " I 'm going to be new , dynamic , debased , " she said gloomily . " You might get a chance tonight . Shanks is giving a party . " " Oh , god . " She reversed herself instantly . " We 're not going , surely . At least I 'm not . " " Be a great opportunity for the new you , " Jim said . " Oh , quit baiting me , " she said with a little heat . " I know I 'm duller even than you . I give up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's cowboyism personified . I want to stay home and read . " " Suit yourself . I 'm going . Maybe some cowgirl will seduce me . Then we 'll have some guilt to work with . What our marriage needs is a little guilt . " " I said hush , " she said . " Do n't talk to me in that vein . " But they continued to talk in exactly that vein throughout the afternoon . They kept up a running low-grade argument of a sort they were expert at . They could n't seem to drop it , but neither did it flare high . When Boots and Pete finally came , Patsy was relieved and quickly forgave them for their tardiness . Pete looked sort of comical in his snipped-off jeans . The late afternoon heat was terrific and the water felt good . Boots dove a lot , not gracefully , but with great energy . She wore a two-piece green suit , not quite so skimpy as Patsy 's bikini . After a while they all got out and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Boots at least was very , very happy to be getting married . She sat by Pete and hung on to his arm or his shoulder constantly . Once she kissed him shyly behind the ear . Patsy was amused and a little envious  --  she would never have kissed Jim behind the ear in public . Pete was relaxed and quiet . He scarcely looked at Patsy and took Boots 's affection gracefully , now and then circling her waist with his arm . It turned out that both of them were from Fort Worth . " Different sides of town , of course , " Pete said . " Different sides of the track . " " We 're both from Dallas , " Jim said . " Same side of the track ,  | worse luck . " Patsy was irked by the remark but said nothing . Boots 's father owned a big Dodge agency but spent most of his time racing horses in Colorado . Pete volunteered no information on himself . They dried and changed and walked down the street to a diner : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boots thought Jim 's occasional small witticisms were uproariously funny . She laughed so loudly at them that Patsy was at first annoyed and then a little touched . Pete looked at Boots fondly when she laughed and occasionally made some dry response of his own . Once he reached up with a napkin and wiped a bit of mayonnaise off her cheek . Boots was talking to Jim and scarcely noticed , but Patsy observed it and found herself liking Pete more and more . He seemed like a watchful , gentle , very trustworthy sort of man . When they had eaten , Boots and Jim wandered up the street together , talking about Fort Worth , and Patsy waited for Pete . He had stepped back into the diner to get a toothpick and emerged smiling , the toothpick held between his teeth . To the west the sky was changing color . The two of them walked quietly along the sidewalk for almost a block , hearing Boots 's light rapid voice ahead of them in the dusk . " You have a nice bride , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had wanted to say . Walking beside him made her realize that he was several inches taller than she was . His appearance was a little contradictory : he was tall and at times seemed lanky , but he had a heavy belly . " Nicer than I deserve , " he said , glancing at her . Patsy was used to people who put themselves down as a matter of course , but Pete was not putting himself down at all , which made it a very nice thing to say about Boots , she thought . She felt slightly uneasy . Pete did not seem unusually bright and she was used to using brightness as a standard in judging men . There was something to him , even if he was n't unusually bright . His walk was not like most men 's . It appeared to be a slouch , but it had a springiness too , so that when he moved he seemed both slow and quick . Walking beside him , she could well understand Boots 's habit of hanging on to him : he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could put her arm around his waist as they walked along , there would seem less need for talk . It did disconcert her that she was so at a loss for small talk with him ; it was for her a very rare thing . Since childhood everyone had 103  | always made much of her because she said interesting , slightly unusual things ; and yet she could n't think of a thing to say to Pete that he would be likely to find interesting . Casting about , she thought of Sonny Shanks 's party . " Will you and Boots be at the party tonight ? " " No . We do n't party much . Who 's having one ? " " Sonny Shanks . " " Yeah , I forgot . He invited us , sort of . " He frowned and tilted the toothpick down . " Sonny and I can do without one another , " he said . They stepped off the curb at a corner and just as they did two high school boys in a red Mustang cut sharply around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . The car squealed away into the dusk . In stepping back to avoid it , they touched , her arm against his arm . The brief contact startled Patsy and she forgot what she had been about to say . Then she remembered Sonny . " I do n't like him either , " she said . " He seems to have made a better impression on my husband . Why do n't you like him ? " She had not meant the question to be bold , or probing , but saw at once that it was a mistake . " Oh , it ai n't worth talking about , " he said . His tone was not unfriendly , but there was a strong note of reserve in it . Patsy felt she had accidentally put him off , and she did n't know how to remedy the matter . " He used to go with my Aunt Dixie , " she said . " Dixie McCormack ? " Pete asked , surprised . He looked at her with friendly astonishment , and Patsy immediately felt lighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone seems to know her . " " I worked for her husband for about six months one time . Never would have picked you for her niece . " " Sonny Shanks said exactly the same thing , " she said . The street lights came on as they were walking . Pete glanced at her and Patsy caught the glance and was a little unsettled . He did seem to like her , and she was glad , but she had no idea why he liked her , or what aspect of her he liked . It was confusing and not altogether pleasant , and she was glad when he and Boots were in the Thunderbird driving away . After they were gone she stood on the driveway a little while making patterns in the gravel with her foot . Jim put his arms around her waist . 104  | " You see , they 're nice , " he said . " You were just being unfair to them this afternoon . " " Of course I was , " she said , stepping away from him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm a very unfair person . If you have n't learned that about me yet , what have you learned ? " Jim went in without answering and she stood where she was , watching a white airliner slice gracefully down through the blue evening air . " I WISH I HAD the will power to stay here , " Patsy said , twisting in front of the mirror so she could see the back of her dress . " I do n't think this dress is right , but then I have no idea what would be right for a party Sonny Shanks is giving . If the place is swarming with cowgirls I 'm going to look odd . " " That 's never bothered you before , " Jim said . He wore a red sports shirt and his gray sports coat and had been ready to go to the party for fifteen minutes . He was sitting in a chair leafing through : in issue of Playboy . " Hush . Whatever my faults , I seldom look odd . " She had put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided it made her look a little too much like a college girl attending a lecture by a famous lecturer . That struck her as being the wrong look for the evening ahead and she shucked the dress off and selected a simple brown sleeveless blouse and a skirt . She had been experimenting with her hair again and as she was bent over taking her slip off one of the slip straps caught on a small hairclip . She struggled for a moment but could not get an arm free to loosen it . " Help , please , " she said , walking over to where Jim sat . He was actually looking at the Playmate of the Month , not with desire or even admiration , but when he looked up and saw Patsy peering at him trustingly from deep within her slip he felt a little guilty and at once closed the magazine and stood up to help her . " Looking at cows again , " she said . " No wonder you like rodeos if those are your ideal . " She turned her back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was looking at that picture out of professional curiosity , " he 105  | said . " Yours are my ideal . " And when he had undone the slip so she could remove it he put his arms around her , his hands on her bosom , and held her against him for a minute . They swayed a little from side to side . It made her feel nicely wanted , nicely touched . " You 're nice , " she said . " I 'd really rather you photographed rodeo cows than Playboy cows , if you do n't mind . " " I do n't mind , " Jim said . Sonny 's motel was a vast network of two-story structures made of sand-colored brick and arranged in what appeared to be a great square . " It 's a walled city , " Patsy said . She sat in the Ford while Jim went in to get the number and approximate location of Shanks 's room . Three large fountains spurted colored water thirty feet in the air . The water was now orange , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was puzzling over a large sheet of paper . " His room is about two miles from here as the crow flies , " he said . It proved to be a corner suite on the upper story , not so hard to find as they had feared . When they rang , a tall expressionless middleaged man opened the door for them . He was dressed in a conservative gray suit , set off by a neat pink tie ; he nodded but did n't speak when they said hello . He simply left the door open and turned and went across the room to a white chair near the large picture window . On a rack not far inside the room was the enormous ornate saddle they had glimpsed in the hearse . The saddle horn appeared to be gold-plated and the pommel was covered with silver inlays . The saddle clashed grotesquely with the rest of the suite , which was roomy , nicely lit , and nicely furnished . The picture window looked out on a central courtyard and a large curved pool . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one covered with a blue bedspread . Sonny sat on it cross-legged , a drink in his hand . He was barefooted and wore Levi 's and a red satin shirt . A short , stolid young cowboy sat in a chair nearby and looked at them resentfully when they came in . Sonny uncurled himself from the bed and made Patsy a half-bow . " The party 's made , " he said . " Never expected you to forgive me . " " I ca n't resist parties , " she said somewhat stiffly . " You 'll have a Coke and Jim will have what ? " " I 'll have a gin and tonic , if you do n't mind . I ca n't stand being predicted . " 106  | " Well , just keep telling me what you ca n't stand and little by little I 'll improve , " Sonny said , grinning . Though there was a liquor table with a Negro barman standing behind it , Sonny went over personally to fix their drinks . The two of them felt stranded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of quiet boredom . " Well , no cowgirls , at least , " Patsy said . As she said it a lady they both instantly felt they ought to know emerged from the other bedroom in conversation with a short , slightly chubby , grizzled man in a Hawaiian sports shirt . As soon as the woman saw them she came over . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " I did n't know anyone else had come . I 'm Eleanor Guthrie . In a sense I 'm the hostess . " " My goodness , " Jim said . He had brightened the minute she walked over . " Come now , " Eleanor said , smiling at Patsy . " If you were n't from Texas you would never have heard of me . It 's just my bad luck to be the last cattle queen . " They walked over with her to meet the man in the sports shirt . There was a phonograph in the far corner of the room , and a Beatles album was on , turned rather low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sports shirt was quietly snapping his fingers and doing a slow dance step by himself . He stopped and shook hands firmly when they were introduced . He had a merry , slightly rakish look , for all his chubbiness , and a mustache and a good smile . " This is Mr. Vaslav Percy , " Eleanor said . " He 's a novelist , a poet , and a screenwriter . " " Vaslav Joe Percy , " he said , smiling cheerfully at Patsy . " It 's an awful nom de plume , " he added . " Do n't take it seriously . Joe will do . You got tagged with names like that in Hollywood in the thirties . I picked the Vaslav because I liked ballet and it was Nijinsky 's first name . Dance with me , Eleanor ? " " Oh , I better pass , " she said . " There will be people to greet . " Sonny brought Jim and Patsy their drinks and immediately left to answer the door . Joe Percy began to move again with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked . " Young revolutionaries of some kind ? " " We 're graduates , " Patsy said . " We 're both very inactive . What ; ire the names of your books ? Maybe I 've read some of them . " " My books ? " he said . " Be serious . Eleanor was flattering me . I 'm 107  | a screenwriter . I wrote a couple of books long ago but kids nowadays do n't know them , thank god . They read enough junk without reading me . Terrible books , as I remember them . " " Come on , " Patsy said . " Tell me . I never met a published writer before , I do n't think . " " Good god , " he said . " Have you been living in an egg or something ? I 've met six thousand novelists in the last year alone . You dance with me  --  maybe we can put on something a little more raucous . I never reveal the names of my books to a woman unless I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " Patsy was quite shocked , but the shock did n't linger long . Mr. Percy had said the word too casually and in too merry a tone , with no evident intention of shocking anyone at all . She was used to hearing the word used at semi-bohemian student parties where everyone was exaggeratedly drunk or genuinely high , but she was not used to hearing it in the company of someone like Eleanor Guthrie . Fortunately Joe Percy was one of those men who could make the frankest speech sound innocent . His good nature was so obvious that it would have been almost impossible for him to sound obscene . Patsy decided that the essence of sophistication was the ability to absorb such shocks with a gay smile , so she accompanied Mr. Percy to the phonograph table and they looked through the records together . " Actually , for you I 'll make an exception , " he said , for he was also perceptive and had noted the shock he had given her . " If you 'll excuse my crudity I 'll reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispose of the subject . You wo n't believe what they 're called . " " I will too , " she said . " I 'm gullible . " " Okay , " he said , lifting his drink in a kind of salute . " My novel was called The Opalescent Parrot and my book of poems was called The Final Albatross . The thirties were as unbelievable as my titles , at least where I was . Everybody had their bit and mine was bird imagery . All my screenwriting buddies were writing proletariat crap about the wretched of the earth , so to be different I wrote Firbankian crap about tubercular degenerates . If you happen on either of the books , love me a little and do n't read it . I 'd do as much for you if you wrote a book . " " I believe you , " Patsy said . " I promise . " Most of the other records were hillbilly or pop vocalists and they 108  | ended up dancing to the Beatles after all . Patsy loved to dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite his slight chubbiness , danced with flair . The room filled very suddenly , almost in one rush , as they were dancing . Patsy did n't notice the people closely until they stopped to rest , but when she did she felt lucky to have got Mr. Percy to dance with . He was a very appealing man and he admired her and let her know it , but without giving her any more starts . Most of the other people who poured into the room looked depressing and slightly shabby . They looked like night-club announcers , or disc jockeys , or young restaurateurs , and their wives were mostly thin and had dyed hair . They would have made her feel depressed and lost and wretchedly out of place , but Mr. Percy , by dancing with her and treating her generally as if she were the loveliest woman around , kept her feeling pleasant . Now and then she caught glimpses of Jim and Eleanor Guthrie . They were sitting on a couch and seemed to be talking rather gravely . When Mr. Percy had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Boy , " he said . " You almost inspired me to a coronary . Excuse me . I 've got to find the place . " " Come back , " she said . " I think you 're the only one here I want to talk to . " As he was leaving , Sonny Shanks came over . " See you 're having fun , " he said . " You do n't have to dance with that fat little writer all the time . I can do them dances too . " " All right , " she said , not enthusiastic . The minute Joe Percy walked away she had begun to feel out of place . Jim was still talking to Eleanor , and it was hard to blame him . In looks and dress and manner Eleanor was all she might have been supposed to be  --  a very lovely woman , rather grave and not at all vulgar . She wore a white dress and her dark blond gray-streaked hair was pulled to one side . Now and then her face lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore a gold bracelet and a green pendant of some kind , set in gold . Watching her , Patsy felt like the merest schoolgirl , like a college freshman and a prim and proper freshman at that . " I expected more cowboys , " she said to Sonny . They had moved to a corner where there was room to dance . " You got me down for a hick just because I rodeo , " he said . " I ai n't such a hick . " She really did not feel like dancing with him and was merely 109  | swaying with the music , moving her arms a little . Sonny followed suit , a yard away . " This is just how I had it planned , " he said . " Ol ' Jim can keep Eleanor happy and I can dance with you . She likes to have someone young and smart and up on this ' n ' that to talk to and I do n't know many people who can fill the bill . " " She could talk to Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " He ai n't young an ' en-tranced , though . " " No . He 's en-tranced with me . " " Ai n't we all ? " She kept her eyes off him , looking at the dancers . Most of the male guests might have been chosen expressly to make Sonny stand out  --  thin-chested dull-looking men whose suits or sports coats did n't fit . Joe Percy was the only one among them who seemed to have any character , or even any energy . He was dancing again . A silver blonde in green Capris had snagged him when he emerged from the john . Even without the red shirt and Levi 's and bare feet Sonny would have stood out . In such a crowd his confidence of movement was striking enough . And he was not so imperceptive as she had supposed . He very quickly figured out that she did n't want to dance with him and stopped suddenly and dropped into a chair . He draped a leg over the chair arm and waved his bare foot in him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsomeness seem brittle . When he frowned , as he was frowning at her , his face filled with hollows and shadows and became a more formidable face than it had been . " So what 's so good about you ? " he said , looking her in the eye . " I do n't know , " Patsy said , startled by the question . " I never said anything was . " " Eleanor 's as good-lookin ' as you , " he said , as if arguing with himself , though he continued to look at her . " That redhead over by my saddle ai n't bad , if you set her in the right light . What do you think you got on ' em , hunh ? " " Nothing , " Patsy said , disturbed . " Nothing . What are you talking about ? I do n't have anything on anybody . My god , what a conversation . " 110  | " Nothing wrong with it , " Sonny said reflectively , waving for the barman to bring him a drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , impatient with him . " I did n't say anything to make you talk to me that way . " " Right , " he said , smiling suddenly as if she had just reminded him of something . " It was just seeing you , you know . Milk right from the cow . You ai n't even had time to cool . You 're right as you can be . Who wants to talk to a nice pitcher of milk . " And he grinned at her over the glass the barman handed him . The comment offended Patsy to the quick . Not only was he presuming to size her up , but the result of it all was that he had sized her up precisely as she had sized herself up every time she looked at Eleanor Guthrie . She was a girl . It did not please her at all that he found her girlishness entrancing . She could not think of a comeback to his remark about her being a pitcher of milk  --  though later she thought of a hundred . She turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the john , very depressed and wishing she had had the good sense to stay at the motel . But a look in the mirror improved her spirits . The dancing had given her color . She was not going to let a bastard like Sonny Shanks chase her home . What she needed was to find Mr. Percy and dance some more . When she came out , Shanks was standing in the bedroom looking even moodier than he had been . " Never meant to tick you off , " he said . " I was just paying you a compliment . " She did n't like him being there waiting for her . He spoke quietly enough , but she did n't like his stance , or his eyes . There was a force in him very much stronger than any she had ever had to deal with , and it scared her . " Oh , just leave me alone , " she said , going past him . " Go bother my aunt , if you have to bother somebody . " Sonny pursed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said in a very casual tone . It was as if he had suddenly decided to switch off the force . Patsy went back to the party a little confused . Sonny was too shifty  --  one second hateful , the next almost likable . She went over and sat down on the floor by the couch near Jim 's legs . Joe Percy was there , mopping his brow , and Jim looked slightly pinched around the mouth , as if he wished Joe Percy were n't there . When  | Patsy sat down Jim glanced at her fondly , but it was an absent , abstract fondness , as if his mind and not his eyes had registered her presence . Joe Percy held a whiskey glass with a single ice cube in it . He twirled the glass in his fingers in such a way that the whiskey and the cube spun around and around together , the cube never touching the glass . " How do ? " he said when Patsy sat down . " I never made it back . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance some more . " His eyes were friendly and intelligent , and he did not appear to be fooled by anyone , least of all himself . " Yep , I 've written every kind , " he said , turning back to Eleanor . " Jungle movies , pirate movies , serials , spy movies , movies about the Mounties , everything . I 've worked for more fourth-rate directors than any man alive , unless it 's Randolph Scott . So now I guess I 'll write a rodeo movie . From what I 've seen of rodeo , it deserves me . " " A versatile man , " Eleanor said . " I should say , versatile , " he said . " You would n't know the half of it . " He winked at Patsy and gave her a sly , confidential , surprisingly tender smile , as if to neutralize in advance any vulgarity he might feel called to utter . " There was once a famous actress , plagued like myself by fourthrate directors , who assured me I was the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , " he added with a broad grin . " Always excepting Bob Mitchum . " " I think you 're a trifle vain , " Patsy said , deciding she liked such conversations when they were with people like Mr. Percy . She was positive no actress had ever told him any such thing , he was merely being entertaining , probably for her benefit . " Trifle ! " Joe Percy said . " I should hope I 'm vain . A writer without vanity would be like a woman without a cunt , if you 'll pardon the usage . Drink , anyone ? " He got up and went to the bar . Jim was patting his foot nervously in time with the music . " I wonder what makes Californians so blunt , " Eleanor said . Patsy had no idea . She felt a bit flat and noticed that Jim was getting drunk . She did n't have to look at him to notice it , she could tell by his voice . He had only been drunk four or five times since they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the picture window . The lights of Phoenix were brilliant in the darkness .  | Looking down , she saw that Sonny and the man in the gray suit and one of the girls in Capri pants were standing by the swimming pool . Sonny still had on the red shirt but had changed to swimming trunks . He stripped off the shirt , slid into the pool , and swam two lengths , cutting right down the center of the greenish water . Then he pulled himself smoothly back up on the side and shook the water off himself with a twist or two of his body , almost like a dog . The girl handed him his shirt and the three of them disappeared beneath the ledge of the motel . Mr. Percy came over and suggested they dance some more , but Patsy shook her head . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " I 've had enough of this party . I like you , though . I 'm glad I met you . " " Mutual , " he said and kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's it , " he said . " Smile . You 've got a smile all your own . " When she told Jim she wanted to take a cab back to the motel he was surprised and confused and followed her shakily to the telephone . " Are n't you having a good time ? " he asked . " I did for a while . I 'm just worn out . You 're getting looped , you know . I think that lady 's gone to your head . " Jim looked guilty and fumbled through the yellow pages , trying to select a taxi service . " Do n't look abashed , " she said . " Stay and have a good party . She ought to go to your head . If I were a man she 'd probably go to mine . I 'll expect you to tell me everything she says . Let me take the Ford . You 're the one who will need a cab . " " Okay , " he said . " I love you . " He followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if to prove it . She did n't need proof , and the kiss was interrupted by Sonny and the girl and the silent man . " Leavin ' us ? " Sonny asked . " Shame . I 'll walk you to your car . " As before , he gave her no choice , but he seemed to be feeling good and went ahead of her , doing a little dance step . She was embarrassed to have been seen kissing her husband . " Who is that man who was with you ? " she asked . " Does n't he speak ? " " Not much . That 's the pill man . He sells pills . " " Pills ? " " Yeah , all kinds . Good pills . Ever take any ? " 113  | " Only the pill with a capital P. And aspirin occasionally . " " Well , you ai n't keepin ' up with the times , " he said . " If you 've got a pill that will get my husband home to me , give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on you . " " I 'll bring him home myself if he does . " He gallantly opened the door for her and bowed her in . " Is that Western courtliness ? " she asked . " You 're always bowing and dipping . " But Sonny had turned and was already trotting lightly across the motel parking lot , his shirttails flapping as he ran . PATSY WAS GLAD that Jim had elected to stay at the party . Though it disconcerted her a little to see him drunk , she had the notion that drunkenness was good for him . It seemed to her that if he was really going to try and be some kind of artist he probably ought to live a little more wildly than he did . Him getting drunk was fine , but she had no desire to stay around being the responsible wife of a drunken man . She could n't imagine anything bad happening to him , or him doing anything bad , and was sure he would wander in in an hour or two , voluble , contrite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too late that she would have liked to dance more , but the only man there she had wanted to dance with was Mr. Percy , and she was not sure how long he would have held up . She put on her green gown and got in bed to read . They had a bedraggled paperback copy of The Sot-Weed Factor that she had been whimsically picking her way through for weeks . She read a page or two and put it down and went to the book box to dig out Gibbon . They had an old three-volume Modern Library edition that one of Jim 's teachers had given him in high school . Patsy had been reading it intermittently ever since they had married and was almost through Volume II . She dug it out , but after a page or two of it she concluded she was not in a reading mood and got a pen and some paper and began a letter to her friend Emma Horton . Frequently in their letters to each other she and Emma adopted the 114  | pretense that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year they had both taken a course in the English novel and had read Pamela together . Their letters were usually full of all sorts of sophomoric literary showing-off , and they both enjoyed them immensely . Emma was married to a graduate student in English . She was fat and rather slovenly but very bright and sweet and kind of heart , and she had two children already , both boys . Dear Em , I 'm too tired to write long sentences . I just got home from a wicked party . Why people sleep with the people they seem to sleep with is beyond me . Why anyone sleeps with anyone is sort of a puzzle , actually . The party was given by Mr. Sonny Shanks , World 's Champion Cowboy . He 's the one who sat me down on the bed where he had just done it , as you 'll recall . I met his mistress  --  at least I assume she is . Eleanor Guthrie , who owns the big ranch . Very lovely  --  she could do much better than him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She made me feel underweight . I was the second-most-ogled , though . I met a real screen writer who used real dirty words . It was a very worldly party . There was even a pusher there , very sinister . I think it was William Burroughs . We 're going to Utah next  --  god knows how long that will take , or where I 'll be stuck . I 'll be glad when we get back to Houston . We can exchange secrets , if either of us have any by then . She paused , and was debating whether to go into a description of the Tatums , or the Tatums-to-be , when she heard a car drive up outside . After a moment there was a gentle knock at the door . " Jim ? " " Me . " It was Shanks 's voice . " Just making a delivery . " " Oh , okay , " she said . " One minute . " She went to the closet and got her terry-cloth robe , a little surprised that Jim had passed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , getting more and more voluble as the night progressed . She belted the robe around her so that as little of her nightgown showed as possible . But when she opened the door there was no sign of Jim , just Sonny standing there smiling at her cheerfully . He was just as he had been at the beginning of the party , in the red shirt and Levi 's and still barefooted . His heavy black hair was tousled and still a little wet from his swim . He strolled in and looked around the room with interest . 115  | " This is how the pore half lives , ai n't it ? " he said . " You-all ai n't poor , what are you doin ' here ? I wish I had a dollar for ever crappy little motel room I 've stayed in . " Patsy 's heart was pounding . He had walked in so quickly that she could n't think . She merely stood where she was , her hand on the doorknob . " Where 's my husband ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim was probably in it , somewhere . " He 's probably about ready to fall over in Eleanor 's lap , if he ai n't already . I come right on as soon as you left , but I had to run an errand or two on the way . " " Please get out , " she said . " I thought you were bringing my husband . I did n't invite you here . " Sonny waved a hand at her as if what she said was only a joke between friends . He sat down on the bed , picked up the volume of Gibbon , and looked at it curiously . " Wonder why I 've taken to women who read in my old age , " he said . " First forty or fifty I went with could n't read the directions on a mousetrap . " " Would you get off my bed and get out , " Patsy said , anger replacing her fear . She flung the door back so hard that the doorknob made a dent in the cheap plaster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to be gone . Sonny put the book down , peered for a moment at her letter , which was on the bed , and got up and moved toward the door . Just as she was ready to slam it behind him and start crying , Patsy realized he was n't going out . His moves were always surprises  --  she was never quite up with him . He came right to her , before she realized that was where he was coming , and took her and scooped her off her feet . She stiffened , but his surprises had a kind of paralyzing effect ; they all but stopped her heart . Sonny nudged the door shut with his heel and crossed the room and laid Patsy on the bed , taking some care not to mash her letter . The paralysis wore off when he put her down and she began to cry , very confused and expecting instant rape . But Sonny brought a box of Kleenex and kept handing them to her until her crying fit passed and she could see him again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop her mouth from quivering and her chest from heaving . " Calm down , " he said . " I ai n't gon na hurt you . "  | " Then what are you doing ? " she asked weakly . " Why are you here ? Why are n't you at your own party ? " " Well , you seen what kind of party it was . I mostly got it up hoping you 'd come . " " What do you mean ? " she said . " Hoping I 'd come . Mrs. Guthrie was there . Why bother me ? " " Miss Guthrie , " he said . " She 's one of those folks that are so rich they do n't change their names when they get married . One reason I ai n't never married her . She do n't want to be named Shanks and I sure ai n't gon na change my name . " " Oh , anyway , " Patsy said . " I does n't affect what I meant . This is all absurd . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got looks all your own . I just wanted to get you by yourself a few minutes to see if you might not turn out to like me . If you do , we can sort of take it from there . " " To hell with that , " Patsy said . " I could have started liking you at the party if I was going to . I 'm not going to start liking you now , and I certainly do n't like you barging in on me with some subterfuge and then refusing to leave when I asked you to . I 'm married ! Do n't cowboys understand marriage at all ? " " Understand what about it ? " " Oh , please , just go away , " she said . " I do n't want to argue with you and it makes me very uncomfortable for you to be sitting on my bed . I 'm married , that 's all , and you and I are not going to take anything from anywhere . Just go away . You scare me in here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tolerant amusement . " Well , that 's a start , anyway , " he said . " It 's not a start ! Do n't twist my words favorably . I 'm not going to suddenly stop being scared of you and throw myself in your arms . Just get out . Please get out ! " " How long you been married ? " he asked . " No , " she said . " No conversation . I do n't want to talk to you . If you want to know anything send me a questionnaire and I 'll answer it in detail . I do n't want to talk any more . " " Well , I just hope I ai n't fallin ' in love with you , " he said with light sarcasm and put his hand on her calf . Patsy rolled off the bed and clenched her fists .  | " I knew you 'd try something , " she said . " Go back to your party , you stupid slob . I 'm going to call the police unless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to men who could really move , and as she turned to go to the phone Sonny caught her and scooped her up in his arms again . His face was a few inches from hers , and the genuinely amused look he had when he came in had been replaced by the hard varnished smile he had worn at the party . " I hate to be called stupid , " he said . " Specially by young bitches who do n't know up from down . You could learn more from me than you 'll learn from your goddamn books . " The Gibbon had been knocked on the floor and with a single kick Sonny sent it flying across the room . He was holding her so tightly in his arms that she could feel his muscles , as hard and ungiving as wood . With no further ado he carried her to the door , lowered her a bit so he could open it and carried her out . " I ai n't kidnaping you , " he said . " You ai n't in no danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your goddamn jaw . " The set of his face and his wooden muscles convinced her that he meant it . She had never been close to real violence in her life and was scared almost breathless . He would certainly hit her if he felt moved to , and the thought was terrifying . He boosted her abruptly into the back end of the hearse and shoved her toward the bed where she had sat once before . Then he climbed in after her and pulled the doors shut . " Let 's go , Coon , " he said . Patsy looked around and saw that the sullen young cowboy who had been at the party was in the driver 's seat . He looked back at her , still sullen . " Oh , please , I apologize , " she said . " I 'm sorry I called you stupid . Do n't take me anywhere , just let me go back in . " Sonny seemed to have recovered some of his earlier good humor . He stretched out one leg and propped his foot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " You got to take the consequences of being insulting . That 's Coon Carter driving . Coon , Mrs. Carpenter . " " Mr. Shanks , please , " Patsy said . " You know you did n't have any right to be in my room . I apologize again . Please let me go back . " But Sonny waved Coon on and the hearse pulled out of the  | courtyard . Patsy looked back sadly at the Ford and tried to straighten her hair . She felt too numb to cry . " You did n't even shut the door to my room , " she said . " Suppose people go in and steal us blind ? I have things I do n't want stolen . What kind of person are you ? " Sonny reached his bare foot in the direction of her calf , but she avoided it by scooting back on the mattress . She enveloped herself as totally as possible in her bathrobe . " Where we goin ' ? " Coon asked . His voice was husky , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , the rodeo grounds , I guess . I did n't have nothing definite in mind . I just thought we ought to get Mrs. Carpenter away from her books for a while . " Patsy felt she disliked him more than any person she had ever known . He was arrogant and irritating when he was being pleasant , but when he was being unpleasant , even slightly , he was terrifying . She felt she had rather eat a fair amount of crow than risk making him angry again . " Arizona ai n't got many crooks , " he said . " Nothin ' much 'll get stolen . " He seemed to derive a great deal of amusement from the way she huddled over her knees clutching her bathrobe . He drew his foot back and rubbed his other shin with it . " Hurt my toe , kicking that book , " he said . " I 'm glad . This strange farce is all your doing and I 'm glad you are n't going to come out of it completely unscathed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , " he said . They passed his motel , the colored waters still spurting high behind the ornamental palms . Soon they were approaching the darkened rodeo grounds . " Everybody here 's probably asleep , " Sonny said . " Let 's go out in the arena . " " I find this exceedingly bizarre , " Patsy said . The young man named Coon got out and opened a gate and got back in and drove them through the entranceway to the arena . He seemed to find it bizarre too , and a little nerve-racking . He cut off his lights and kept glancing at the bleachers . They proceeded slowly out into the arena , lit only by the desert moonlight . The bleachers were dark bulks . Patsy was feeling scared again ; her legs were  | trembling and she hugged her knees to keep them still . Sonny was fumbling in the pile of junk , clothes , and equipment that littered one side of the hearse . When they reached the middle of the arena Coon stopped the hearse . " Turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The inside lights . We ai n't botherin ' nobody but Patsy , and we got her too buffaloed to yell . " " You better be polite , " she said . " I 'm not too friendly with you just now and I may yell any second . " " When you start yelling , that 's when we 'll be leaving , " Sonny said . " Knew I had a piggin ' string here somewhere . This hearse is like Fibber McGee 's closet . Let 's get out and stretch our legs . " He opened the doors and got out , an old towel and a short piece of rope in his hand . " I do n't want to get out , " Patsy said , still hugging her knees . " This is not my idea of a good place to be this time of night . " " Aw , come on , " he said . " I do n't want to drag you out . It would just embarrass you and Coon both . " Patsy changed her mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her to get out , and he had handled her twice already , as easily as an experienced mother handles a child that does n't want to be diapered . Her best bet was to keep him in a good humor , she decided . " Okay , " she said . " If you insist , Mr. Shanks . " She kept the bathrobe tucked about her , and he helped her down . " Just stay in the car , Coon , " he said and walked a few steps away from the hearse and squatted down . " If you 'll just have a seat this wo n't take a minute , " he said . " You 're really out of your mind , " Patsy said . " Have a seat where ? " " Right here on god 's earth , " Sonny said . Patsy sighed and squatted down a little distance from him , but she was nervous and lost her balance and sat down . When she did Sonny grabbed her ankles , scaring her out of her wits again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had said about breaking her jaw . But Sonny was talking soothingly , as he might to a frightened animal . " Just take it easy now , " he said . " Not what you think at all . " He crossed her ankles and began to wrap the old towel around  | them . Patsy was shaking , but she did n't say anything . She felt quite speechless . When he had wrapped the towel around her ankles he wrapped the short rope around them too , over the towel , pulled it tight , and tied it . " I brought the towel so you would n't get no rope burn , " he explained . " Thanks , " Patsy said . She was becoming not quite so scared as it dawned on her that what he had in mind was not ravishment but something in the nature of a crude practical joke . Sitting in the sandy arena made her feel very undignified , but better indignity than a broken jaw . " Now , " Sonny said , squatting in front of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm afraid I do n't , " she said in a shaky voice . " Quit shaking , " he said . " I told you not to be scared . Ai n't nothing more gon na happen . I 'm just gon na drive off and leave you here . Probably be the last we 'll see of one another for a while . " " I must say I hope so , " Patsy said . Sonny chuckled good-naturedly . " Yeah , I bet you do hope so , " he said . " What it demonstrates is that you ca n't never tell what might happen . I bet when you was primping for the party you never thought you 'd finish off the evenin ' hogtied in the rodeo pens . " " No , " Patsy said . " The possibility never occurred to me . " Sonny leaned down and pulled at the knot again and she smelled bourbon on his breath . " Never occurred to me , neither , " he said . " I was really kinda countin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know the truth . We might have had a fling , if we 'd gone about things right . But one of us screwed up , do n't matter which one , and now we ai n't never gon na have a fling , I do n't guess . " " Pity , " she said , tense , wishing he would just go . " Sure is a pity , " he said . " I could get killed any old year now and that 'll be one beautiful memory wo n't neither of us ever have . I 'm kinda sweet to girls , when I want to be . And I always figure the more you have , the more you have , you know . " " I thought you were going , " Patsy said . Sonny laughed a quick deep laugh . " I am , " he said , and as he stepped past , ruffled her hair playfully . " If you ca n't get that knot untied , just yell , " he said . " Lots of 121  | folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get home . " In a moment she heard the hearse 's doors shut and a warm puff of exhaust blew over her , followed by a small cloud of dust as Coon shot the hearse forward too quickly in the loose dirt . It became very quiet , no sound but that of the departing car . Then she heard the clank of the aluminum gate as Coon shut it , and then the sound of the hearse accelerating as it left the grounds . Then no sound at all . If there were animals around they were apparently asleep . Patsy bent forward and discovered to her chagrin that she simply could not untie the rope from around her ankles . She could n't see it , to begin with , and Shanks had pulled the knot so hard that the rope felt as hard and tight as iron . She tried to wiggle her feet out , but it did n't work and just got her gritty . There was nothing to do but yell  --  only what to yell ? It was going to be humiliating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge and dark , though the sky overhead was bright with moon . The thought of a sudden noise was frightening , even though she was going to be the one to make it . There might be bulls sleeping nearby , for all she knew . It was both vexing and scary . " Help , " she said , so hesitantly and quietly that she could barely hear it herself . No answer . " Oh , shit ! " she said , feeling like crying . Then , struck with inspiration , she yelled  --  not " Oh , shit ! " but " Oh , hell ! " as loudly as she could bring herself to . It was not very loud , but it was adequate . Almost immediately a flashlight began to bob around near the entrance to the arena . " It 's me , " she yelled , encouraged . " Over here . " Soon the flashlight began a cautious approach . " Here , here , " she said , to give its owner confidence . It approached to within several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to shine incongruously into the dirt several yards away . " Who-all 's there ? " a man 's voice asked . " Just me , " Patsy said . " Please do n't be scared . I 'm a very harmless maiden in distress . A sort of maniac brought me here and tied me uo . It would be very Christian of you to untie me . " The flashlight zeroed in on her again and then came nearer , followed by the man who held it , a young bulldogger from Idaho . His name was Clint Brink and he was accompanied by his properly paiamaed sweetheart , also from Idaho . They had been spending  | the night in a sleeping bag in one of the bucking chutes . " I know I 'm a surprising sight , " Patsy said , " but do n't worry . I 'm not a trap or anything . " " Goddamn , " the boy said . " How come you to be out here ? " " I doubt I could make it very clear to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me up more or less on a whim . I believe he 's a well-known cowboy . " " Oh , " the young man said , as if that made the phenomenon quite comprehensible . " Hon , I 'm scared , " the girl friend said , peeking hostilely at Patsy from over his shoulder . Clint Brink squatted down at her ankles , very conscious that Patsy 's legs were bare and that his girl was with him . He pointed the flashlight irrelevantly out into the arena and peered through the darkness at the rope . " Could n't you just cut it ? " Patsy asked , but as she asked he jerked expertly a time or two and the knot came loose . " No use ruining a good piggin ' string , " he said , happy to be able to be practical in such a situation . Patsy got up and straightened her gown and robe , brushing off as much sand as possible . It occurred to her that Pete and Boots must be somewhere around , and when she asked Clint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would show her the way to the trailer . His girl hung on to his arm as they walked out of the arena . Patsy kept well back , walking on tiptoe most of the way , worried that she might step on broken glass . At the chutes the young man courteously pointed her to the trailer and handed her the flashlight . " I 'll get it from Pete , " he said . She thanked him profusely and he and his girl went back to their sleeping bag , speculating in whispers about it all . When she got to the trailer it was quite dark and she tapped gently on the door . " Pete , " she said . She had to rap very loudly before he answered . " Yeah ? " " I 'm afraid it 's me . Patsy Carpenter . " In a minute the inside door opened and Pete appeared behind the screen , holding a sheet bunched in front of him . " My lord , " he said . " I 'm so sorry . I hate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dicament and thought maybe you could help me get home . " " Minute , " he said . " I 'll get dressed . " " Please do n't wake Boots , if I have n't already . I 'm very embarrassed to be such a bother . " " Boots ai n't very wakable , " he said and shut the door . She sat down on the narrow aluminum steps , feeling very foolish and out of place . In a moment the door pressed against her back ? it was Pete coming out . He stepped down and stretched , his shirt on but not buttoned . " I know this is incredible , " she said . " I really do n't fit in the rodeo world . " " If I was to guess , " he said , " I 'd guess all this come about because you went to Sonny 's party . " " Right . If you understand it or him I 'd appreciate an explanation . I went to the party and he followed me home and sort of made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but then when I got mad at him he simply carried me off . He did n't really hurt me , but he tied my feet with some kind of rope and left me out there in the middle of the arena . A young man named Brink untied me . Does that make sense to you ? " " Well , it sounds like Sonny . Hop in the Thunderbird . I 'll run you home . " She was glad to be in the car , hidden from people . There was an empty beer can on the floorboard under her feet , and she nervously rolled it back and forth with one foot . The inside of the car smelled of beer and leather and dried horse sweat , from the bridles and halters Boots kept in the back . Pete had difficulty fitting himself under the wheel . " It 's like driving a sardine can , " he said . " I would get a taxi , if there were a place where I could call one . " " No , I 'll run you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Jim ? " " I left him at the party . I guess that was my mistake . " Eleanor Guthrie was there , " she added . " That 's why Jim was so eager to stay . What in god 's name does she see in that man ? " Pete shrugged . He was driving slowly , his face still a little puffy from sleep . " Do n't know the lady , " he said . " I guess women see something in him . " There was a note of flat undisguised sadness in the way he said  | the last sentence , a sadness so noticeable that it made Patsy look at him more closely than she had . He wore a long-sleeved shirt and had not got one of the sleeves buttoned , so that the cuff hung awkwardly off his wrist . She wished he would button it and had an impulse to reach over and do it for him , but she did n't . He glanced at her sharply , as if he had realized he had said too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a child that was up past her bedtime . Her look was so open that he relaxed a little . " My first wife seen somethin ' in him , " he said . " That 's the story of me and Sonny , but do n't go spreadin ' it around . She was n't no more the type to take to him than you 'd think Eleanor Guthrie would be . Even less . Women are hard to tell about . " He stopped talking , as though to close off a morass of memories that he had floundered in too many times . Patsy was disappointed but did n't show it . She had begun to feel secure and comfortable and a little lightheaded and would have liked to chatter about Sonny and probe his psychology , but it was clearly not the sort of thing that Pete would enjoy . " I 'm sandy , " she said . " Another thing he did that infuriated me was that he drove off and left the door to our motel room open . I was afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might hit me . " Do you think he would have ? " she asked . " I do n't know anything about such men . " " Sonny ? Sure . " There was no hearse at the motel , and the door to their room was still open . " Please come in a minute , until I see if anything 's gone , " she said . Pete got out and followed her into the room , but he was nervous . The sight of her made him nervous  --  the flash of her calves as she went through the door , and the way she tossed her hair back from her face . He did n't like being susceptible to anyone but Boots and knew that Patsy was someone he would do just as well to avoid . " The bastard , " she said , going over to pick up the Gibbon . " Now my book 's all crumpled . " Pete stood awkwardly , just inside the door , watching her as she moved rapidly around the room . She peered vaguely at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be where . " It was kind of black humor , you know , " she said , looking with  | relief at Jim 's pile of cameras . But then she looked at Pete and realized he did n't know . It was on her tongue to mention novelists ' names , but he would n't know them either and her remark suddenly made her feel shallow and inconsiderate . He had got out of bed to bring her home , and what right had she to go talking over his head ? " I guess I 'm still nervous , " she said , peeping in the closet . " This sort of thing does n't happen to me every night . In fact , nothing remotely like this has ever happened to me . You do n't suppose he 'll come back , do you ? " " No , he probably went on back to the party , " Pete said . " Might have been someone else there he was interested in . " " No , just me , " Patsy said and blushed immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moved restlessly in the doorway , neither coming in nor going out . " I guess I could go by and beat hell out of him , " he said . " What ? " Patsy said , very surprised . " What do you mean ? There 's no need to do that . He did n't really hurt me . " " No , but he 's got it coming , " Pete said . He was clearly on the horns of a dilemma , and his restlessness was beginning to make Patsy uncomfortable . " Please do n't , " she said . " I do n't like things like that . Fighting . There 's no point in beating him up just because he 's slightly crazy . It 's like those people hitting Jim . Besides , it 's nothing to do with you ? " She stopped , confused . She had been going to remind him that it was not his place , that Jim was the one who would be obliged to defend her honor , if it came to that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacked courage  --  it was just inconceivable . Pete fighting him was conceivable . It was frightening to think of , but it was conceivable . What she knew for certain was that she did n't want to be involved in it in any way . " No point tonight , I guess , " he said . " I 'm too sleepy and he 's probably pilled up a mile high . I better get home . " She followed him out and thanked him again , and he turned and rested his elbows on the open door of the Thunderbird for a minute , rubbing his eyes with one hand . " Poor man , " she said . " You seem to be my guardian angel lately . I 'm afraid I 'm a very inconvenient person to guard . "  | Pete looked up at her . She was standing on the sidewalk , her hands in the pockets of the white bathrobe , with a foot of green nightgown showing underneath it . She looked a little moody , but she did not look like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He told her to be careful , eased back under the wheel , and missed her a little as he drove home . Patsy showered the grit off herself , feeling very keyed up and wide awake . She had begun to worry a little about Jim and contemplated calling the party , but that would merely announce that she was back again , easy prey . It was not really likely that Jim would come to harm , so she did n't call . She made sure the door was really locked and turned off the light and pulled the bedsheet up under her chin . It had been an incredible evening . Grown men had looked at her , and that was very unusual . She was used to being ogled at student parties , but grown men were different . Mr. Percy , in his friendly way , had clearly admired her  --  so had Sonny , although it was strictly a disadvantage to be admired as he admired . And Pete Tatum had looked at her very strangely , particularly as he was about to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had no experience at reading looks , but his had made her uncertain . The evening had made her uncertain . She wanted to go away and be by herself . It was all she could do to cope with being wanted by Jim , her own husband . She looked out the window at the pale light on the street , wishing she were in Houston . In Houston it was clear to everyone that she belonged to Jim . Rodeo people did not seem to see that clearly . Pete saw it , but she could not be sure that he really liked it . Sonny Shanks quite refused to recognize it , as had Ed Boggs . Civilized admiration , such as Mr. Percy had given her , was one thing  --  it was acceptable , it was even her due for being pretty . But uncivilized or ambiguous admiration was quite disturbing . Lying awake , wide-eyed , it occurred to her for the first time how terrible and complicated life would be if she did n't belong to Jim  --  if that simple truth were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim did n't absolutely and automatically belong to her ? What if Eleanor Guthrie wanted him , as Sonny had seemed to want her ? Suddenly she wished very much that Jim were back with her , so she could hold him , touch him , get it all clear again . She felt like crying , from confusion . But she did n't cry and in time felt better . 127  | Perhaps it was only that she was getting older , or getting presence enough that grown men would naturally notice her . Only the thought of Pete Tatum continued to trouble her . He seemed always vaguely troubled himself , and she could not help wanting to know why . He was really the only interesting person that rodeo had turned up and it was frustrating not to be able to really talk to him . She would have liked to know what made him look the way he did , at once confident and a little melancholy . She would have liked to know about his first wife , and why he had married Boots . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a man who talked much , and there was no reason why he should talk to her about such things . Jim could talk to her , if he would only come home . They could have talked over the whole evening and gotten it all clear . But Jim did n't come . Patsy turned for a while , restless , neither unhappy nor content , and then switched on the bed light and got the volume of Gibbon . Its pages were badly wrinkled , but she straightened them as best she could and read until daylight . WHEN SONNY LEFT THE PARTY , the party began to drain out the door . Eleanor had seen it happen often . Though no one there particularly liked Sonny , they all immediately noticed it when he left and became nervous and restless . The tone of the party broke  --  the company seemed to become collectively insecure . Where was Sonny ? Perhaps he had gone to a better party . Perhaps they were no longer where the action was . It bothered them , and after gulping a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came over and told Eleanor it had been nice , but not many did even that , and the few that did were diffident toward her , as if they were not sure they ought to say anything . " Why is everyone scared of you ? " Jim asked . He was tipsy and not scared of her . " It 's uncertainty , " she said . " They do n't quite know where I fit in . If they were really sure I was Sonny 's mistress they 'd be on solid ground . "  | " Mistresses , " Jim said vaguely . He thought she was the most attractive woman he had ever seen . He liked her smile , he liked the way she spoke , he even liked her chuckle . Eleanor , in her turn , found him a pleasant young man , very easy to talk to . If he had not been there she would have spent the evening exchanging sophisticated witticisms with Vaslav Joe Percy , who , besides themselves , was the only guest remaining . He was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bartender jokes . " Do n't tell me you 've had mistress problems , " Eleanor said , smiling at Jim shrewdly . " No . I have n't had any to have problems with , unless I count my wife just before we were married . I do n't suppose a fiancee is the same as a mistress , even if you 're sleeping with her . " Not in the classical sense , " Eleanor said . Jim put his hand to his mouth suddenly , as if he had just received a bad signal from his stomach , but he quickly lowered it again and went on talking about Stanley Kubrick . Eleanor had never seen a Kubrick movie but listened politely , pretending that she had . Jim began to talk more rapidly , as if he knew he was going to topple over asleep at any minute and was desperately trying to keep himself awake . He was talking about Dr. Strangelove . Suddenly he stopped , set his whiskey glass carefully on the floor , and looked blank . " Come on , " Eleanor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Stretch out here on the couch for a minute . I have to excuse myself for a little while , anyway . " Jim obeyed . Eleanor went to the bedroom and when she came back he was asleep . She turned the lamp at the head of the couch so it would n't shine in his eyes . Asleep , he was very good-looking , and very young . She went over to the picture window , where Joe Percy was standing . It was late , he was without an audience and looked tired . " Drank him under , I see , " he said . " Nice boy . He 's probably got a crush on you already . I could probably get a crush on that wife of his if I let myself . " He looked at her and smiled . " And on you as well , " he said , raising his glass . " Is n't it awful ? " " What ? " Eleanor said . " The way people go around getting impossible , inappropriate crushes on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Where did the cowboy go ? " " He did n't tell me . " " Pursuing that young lady ? " " Very probably , " Eleanor said . " Well , he 's a dumb-ass , " Joe said . " It would take her twenty years to catch up with you , if she ever does . Besides , he wo n't get anywhere with her . " " My feeling exactly , " Eleanor said . " Well , you do n't seem very insulted , " he said . " I doubt he has much luck with women of intelligence . " But he realized instantly what he had said and gestured uncomfortably , as if to brush the remark out of the air . But Eleanor was amused . " In all frankness  --  as we say in Hollywood  --  I 've had none with them myself , " he said . " Fortunately they 're a rarity . I guess I better be going . " " I hope your script works out all right , " she said as he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . I 'm a screenwriter , if there 's one left in the world . " Eleanor was taken with a sudden slight melancholy , brought on by the talk of Sonny 's absence and probable whereabouts . Though it was a tranquil melancholy , and an element in her beauty , it showed , and Joe Percy looked at her kindly . " Cheer up , " he said . " It 's all ridiculous , you know . If you ever happen to be in L.A. and bored , I wish you 'd give me a call . Oddly enough , I 'm listed . " " Oddly enough , I might , " she said . " Who can say ? " She went back and looked at Jim , regretting that she had n't made him take his sports coat off before he passed out . She went into her bedroom and found three empty glasses on her dressing table . It annoyed her and she carried them back to the other room . She was sitting on the bed pulling off her stockings when Sonny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , half depressed . " Where 's your new beau ? " he asked . " Do n't be smart , " she said . " He 's asleep on the couch and he 's a very nice young man . Let him sleep . " " Seen some of the party going down the road , " he said . " Hope you took care of everything . "  | " Not very well . You 're an insulting bastard , I must say . " He grinned , sat down beside her , and ran his hand along her smooth calf . " Well , it never got me nowhere , " he said . Eleanor shifted her leg away . " Mr. Percy and I had already concluded that . He remarked that you probably had no luck with intelligent women . " Sonny snorted . " I never had no luck with any kind , " he said . " Who 's that dull little turd to talk ? " " He 's not dull . He 's a little chubby but his essential charm comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Spend a week with him sometime and see what you think then . " He stood up and stretched . " I 'm worn out , " he said . He tossed the red shirt in a corner and slipped out of his jeans . " You 're really going to make a movie ? Finally ? " " It wo n't be worth seeing . What I want is a TV series . That would be real money . " Eleanor went to the bathroom to undress and clean her face , and when she had finished went to the phone and called her pilot . " I want the plane in four hours , " she said . " Where for , ma'am ? " he asked groggily . " Dallas . But we 'll stop by the ranch first . I need some things . " When she returned to the bedroom Sonny was stretched on his back , asleep . She got in bed and lay resting , looking across him , seeing the rise and fall of his chest . In a few minutes he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad leg was cramping ? it often happened . He did n't wake up , but he kept groaning . His foot , calf , and thigh were drawn tight as iron . Eleanor tried to knead them , but as always it was like kneading a section of iron pipe . She persisted , but when the cramp finally loosened she did n't know whether the muscles had relaxed because of her efforts or merely of their own accord . His foot remained drawn , but she rubbed it and twisted it until the toes loosened . Sonny half awoke and raised on his elbows , but then lay down again . When his foot was normal she lay down too and he reached over sleepily and fondled her belly , just at the place where she was heaviest . " I 'm in better shape than you , " he said . " Well , you 're a professional athlete . You ought to be . " But he had gone back to sleep , and she was glad . She awoke easily when it was time and dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt at peace with Sonny . Jim was still on the couch . It was very dark when her cab came and only faintly gray in the east when she got to the hangar where the pilot was waiting . She saw the desert sunrise from the air as they were winging east , saw rose and gold spread upward from New Mexico . The pilot had a thermos of coffee which they shared . She dozed again over West Texas , tired , lulled by the smoothness of the flight and the brownness of the land below . When the plane dropped over the ranch house the gardeners were tending the flower beds and the cowboys had gone for the day . She was there an hour . Lucy was furious . She hated Eleanor 's spates of irrational traveling . In Dallas she told the pilot she would be back in four or five days and caught a plane for New York . That evening , alone at the Carlyle , she found herself tired and depressed and regretted that she had not had the good sense to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who had hoped for eleven years that she would someday marry him . Her depression deepened and she called and broke the date . She put on a robe and sat at the window drinking brandy and watching the lights of the city come on . It had begun to drizzle and the window dripped and blurred , softening the lights . Eleanor felt grateful for the drizzle . It was a time when she preferred things blurred and misted to things dry and clear . In time she replenished her brandy . She became very glad she had broken the date and opened the window a little so she could smell the rain . A fall of rain on New York City smelled so different from a fall of rain on the country . The next morning New York seemed a wonderful city , and she felt fresh and cheerful and had lunch with the banker who hoped to marry her . In the afternoon she shopped a little , dropped in at a couple of galleries , and strolled up Fifth Avenue . She went back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go out in the evening . But she could n't nap . A familiar restlessness hit her , a desire to be somewhere else , somewhere she had never been . With it came a desire for something strange and harsh , something unfamiliar , inappropriate , something in contrast to the good bed , the quiet service  --  all the ease she was accustomed to . She regretted not staying in Phoenix longer , and she broke another date with the patient banker  --  not exactly to his surprise . It was Sonny 's doings and had always been that way . If they could not be together for a week or  | more it was better not to go near him at all . It left her with an edge . She called Phoenix , but Sonny was gone and no one knew where . She looked out the window , but New York no longer seemed attractive  --  merely noisy , crowded , dirty . On a reckless impulse she called Mr. Joe Percy in Los Angeles and reached him at a studio . " Hiya , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what girls say in movies ? " " At one time it was . Is this Eleanor ? " " This is Eleanor . I thought I might come and see you tonight or tomorrow , depending on connections . " " Sure , delighted , " Joe said . " Passing through ? " " No , coming especially , " Eleanor said , feeling wild . " Especially to see me ? I 'm flabbergasted . Why , for god 's sake ? " " Because my father would n't let me date cowboys , " she said . " It had a complicated effect on me . " " It sure must have , " Joe said . " Well , now that you 've explained it , come ahead . " " Do I detect a note of trepidation ? " she asked . " Oh , no , " he said . " What have I got to fear ? Neither of us has any reason not to do anything we want to do , that I can see . " She hung up and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off La Brea . Eleanor realized as they were eating that she liked Joe Percy very much , and all the sense of harshness and strangeness that she had felt on the flight west left her . She began to feel herself again , and very foolish , and Joe Percy realized it and did his gentlemanly best to make a graceful exit possible for her , but his tact only made Eleanor feel the more confused . He offered to get her a hotel room but she declined . " No , " she said . " Maybe I better try to get a flight back to Dallas . I really do n't know what I thought I was doing . " " You look a little worn , " Joe said . " I 've got a perfectly secure guest room you 're welcome to . You ca n't get a flight this late . " Eleanor accepted gratefully . Joe Percy , modestly clad in green pajamas and a blue robe , came to his guest-room door to say good night and found her in bed crying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand and then held it . " Come now , " he said . " Cheer up . I 'll survive the disappointment . I did n't let myself believe it , anyway . " " Oh , " Eleanor said . " I 'm just distraught . I do n't know what I 've 133  | been doing the last three days . This is the silliest thing I 've done in years . " Joe smiled at her . He had good teeth and his mustache worked for him . He was clearly a man who had handled the tears of many women . Eleanor was trembling from her cry and held his hand tightly . " Maybe you 've been reading too much Iris Murdoch , " he said . " Your coming out here like this reminds me a little of her stuff . People are always getting into bed with one another out of the blue . " " No I have n't , " she said , beginning to feel a little less wretched . " I do n't read very good books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe chatted with her until she was feeling calm and pleasant . She told him about her ranch . He had seen most of the world but had never been on a really large ranch and she told him he would have to come sometime . He had been in Australia and told her about a couple of old Australian cattlemen he had known and the stories they told . As he was about to leave he bent to give her a light kiss , looked at her quizzically , smiled , and gave her a real kiss . Eleanor found she had been wanting him to . He drew back and gave her his little sly look , frank and merry and sexy , before he kissed her again , The next morning she sat naked on the bed looking out at the smog-white Hollywood hills . The sheet was around her waist , and she felt heavy and good , uncombed and unkempt , but good . Joe Percy had just come to ask what she wanted for breakfast . He was wearing a pair of red briefs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? " she said . " Did you hypnotize me in Phoenix . You need to lose some weight , you know . " " Nonsense , " Joe said . " This potbelly is my secret . It was obviously my roly-polyness that got to you . " " You must have got to me with more than that , " she said , yawning . " I feel downright despoiled . " " Well , I 'd brag about you but nobody would believe me , " Joe said . " They 'd think you were a fantasy . " " Sonny would believe you , " Eleanor said . " He knows my erratic nature . Besides , I told him you were attractive . " " You did ? Somehow I 've always felt attractive , despite my appearance . How did you contract that horse 's ass ? He must be worse than syphilis . "  | " No , talk nicely about him , " she said quietly . " I 'm sorry , " Joe said at once . " That was thoughtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Joe looked at her and felt sad inside himself , for he would have liked to have seen her right where she was for many mornings , her hair uncombed and her breasts sagging just as they were  --  and he knew he would probably never see her there again . " I must say you 've got your nerve , " she said , noticing his red shorts and grinning at him . " You certainly were greedy . " " Yep , " Joe said , unabashed . " Get up and let 's eat . " " I guess I 'm glad you are , " she said , pulling the sheet off the bed to hold around her . " Men have always rushed to give me things . Very few have ever dared to grab . " " Anyone who gets you in reach and does n't grab is a fool , " Joe said . " I ca n't figure you being single . All your looks , all your dough . How come ? " " Oh , I 'm too sleepy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Is n't it almost noon ? You 're better than sleeping pills . " I really said most of it yesterday , " she added , going to the window to look out at the hills . " Daddy would n't let a cowboy near me , or vice versa . There were only about five men in Texas rich enough to marry me when I came of age . The one I married was sixteen years my senior , and queer to boot , though he did n't know it at the time . I did n't know anything and Daddy paid no attention . He would n't have known it if he had paid attention . He had twelve thousand head of cattle to take care of . My husband and I lived together in honorable wretchedness for eight years and then he killed himself in a rest room of the Adolphus Hotel , in Dallas . It did n't get in the papers the way it was , I assure you . Three months after Daddy died I met Sonny . He took me off in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cliff and I found out what a cowboy was . I found out a lot of things I had n't known . I was twenty-nine . All that time I was married I did the conjugal act maybe twice a year . I did n't know enough to complain , and I had no one to complain to . For weeks after I met Sonny I would n't turn him loose . I could n't believe it was me , but I liked it . That 's why I ca n't help feeling protective of Sonny . He brought me into being . No one else had the nerve . You ca n't imagine how isolating wealth is unless you 've lived in Texas . There are places where wealth makes people a little more  | companionable . In Texas it just guarantees you a comfortable loneliness . " " Have to look Texas over sometime , " he said . " Sounds like a fine place for a novelist manque . Lots of frustration . Hardly anybody screwing readily . There 's too much ready screwing out here  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can have the poetry of it all , " Eleanor said . " You 're going to work , I take it . " " I have to , " he said . " I 'm an underling , comparatively . But I could take you to dinner at an even better restaurant , if you care to hang around . " " Nope , " she said . He went back to his room and when she had put on a robe she went in . He was dressed in a conservative blue suit . On his dresser was a picture of a woman , a brunette in an offshoulder dress . Her hair style belonged to the forties . She caught a glimpse of herself in Joe 's mirror  --  she looked full , even a little overblown . She certainly looked her age . " God , " she said . " I ca n't imagine why anyone would want to go to bed with either of us . That 's a nice suit . " Joe Percy turned from tying his tie and looked at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Of course , out here you might have problems . Out here you need to be sixteen and weigh about ninety-eight pounds to be considered prime . " " Your wife was lovely , " she said . Joe sighed . " Some old girl she was , " he said . " A serial queen , if you can imagine it . She could swing through trees and fall over waterfalls with the best of them . I truly have n't been the same since she died . " " What happened ? " " Cancer , " he said . " About ten years ago . " She looked out the window again . The hills were brown and the smog white as the white houses . It would be nice to arrive home , to fly through the clear plangent evening , with the whole of the Red River Valley spread out below her . She would exchange the neuter smell of Hollywood for the smell of alfalfa and mesquite and perhaps have a word with the cowboys if she got home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked . " I 'll be so bereft without you that I 'll have to get drunk . " " No , " she said . " I have to go . Anyway , you failed me . I wanted  | to feel low and wicked . Now I just feel fat and carnal and a little goofy . " " So ? " he said . " Well , damn , " she said . " You 're too domestic , Joe . You make me feel like I might have made somebody a nice middle-class wife . I do n't want to feel that way now . " " High romance just ai n't my metier , " Joe said . " I 've written too many bad situation comedies . " He looked in the mirror and could not help smiling a dapper smile . He turned his irresistible dapper smile on her . " Quit , " she said . " I do n't want to get comfortable with you . I might marry you . That would throw my directors into a tizzy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly . Daddy never figured I 'd have enough sense to run the estate myself . I do n't have much trouble , though . They 're all scared of me . " They ate the breakfast Joe had fixed , chatting pleasantly . " You really will have to visit , " Eleanor said . " I want you to meet Lucy , my maid . The two of you ought to be exposed to one another . She has a wit not unlike yours . " After breakfast Joe put on a driving cap and they kissed lightly at the door , as if they had been married ten years and had just remembered that they were fond of each other . He drove off in a Morgan with red seats , and Eleanor had more coffee and drank it while looking at his pictures and his books . She made the guest-room bed , called a cab , and when she got home that evening the bullbats were swooping over the long lake in the horse pasture , the cowboys were unsaddling at the barn , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the night . She ate some cold shrimp while Lucy solemnly filled her in on the doings of the week . They prated awhile and Eleanor went to bed with the magazines that had accumulated in her absence . She did n't leave the ranch again for almost three months .  | " YOU 'RE GETTING SEXIER , " Jim said , kissing her shoulder . Her shoulders were freckled from much sitting around swimming pools . Patsy glanced at him . She was in bed filing a nail . He had just showered and was suddenly there at her side , sexually aroused . " I 'm busy , " she said pleasantly . " Take it away . " But Jim went on kissing her shoulders  --  it was really more ticklish than sexy . " A minute , " she said as he was turning her toward him to really kiss her . Just before he did , she managed to burp . She had been next door to a drive-in and had had a vanilla milkshake . Her burp tasted of milkshake and she could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was afraid she would . Still , matters went pleasantly enough . Jim had been off visiting a ranch for three days , rising early and working hard , and passed quickly from coming into sleep . Patsy made it belatedly and not very strongly  --  a short quiver of pleasure , quickly gone  --  but Jim was not awake to resent anything and she calmed quickly and did n't care . She slipped from beneath him and lay with her chin on her arms and her arms on Jim 's back , looking across him . Through the window she could see the green neon sign of their motel and the shallow end of a swimming pool . She was in no turmoil but felt vaguely bothered by the feeling that nothing in her life was ever going to be terribly intense . She would have liked sex better if it made her drowsy more often . She disliked being awake afterward , alone and thinking . She had always supposed she would lead an intense life , one way or another , but it just was n't working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither was she feasting . Her sensations were n't very intense , her emotions were n't very intense , even her imaginings had ceased to be very intense . As usual at such times , her thoughts turned to babies . A baby would surely make for joy . She rubbed her hand fondly up and down her sleeping husband 's back , for he had agreed two weeks before that they should have one . She might be pregnant already . And conditions for parenthood seemed very opportune . She was convinced that Jim was about through with photography  --  his enthusiasm was waning visibly . By 138  | the end of the summer he would be ready to try something more settled , and he was always at a peak of enthusiasm about life when he was starting something new . It would be a good time to be starting a baby . Besides , it had begun to seem to her that fatherhood might be what he was best at . They were in Ogden , Utah , after almost a month of lonely circling through the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jim had come in rumpled and guilty-looking from his night on Sonny 's couch , and when Patsy told him about what Sonny had done he grew very depressed and they drew together and decided to split off from the pro rodeo circuit for a time . They started to Provo , Utah , where everyone else was going , but after several inconclusive arguments about whether or not Sonny was really dangerous they turned and went to Idaho instead . Jim was gloomy and troubled the whole trip . He liked Sonny and hated the complications of it all . They decided that the best thing to do was hunt out small amateur rodeos for a time and avoid the anxiety that having Sonny around would be sure to produce . They went north through Idaho as far as Coeur d'Alene , then cut back through Montana to Missoula , went up to Great Falls , down to Billings , on down to Jackson , Wyoming , then up again to Miles City , to Bismarck , North Dakota , down again through South Dakota to Mobridge and Pierre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time in Colorado . Whenever they saw a rodeo poster they made a side trip if necessary . To her surprise Patsy found that she liked the country they were traveling through . Except for one childhood trip to Yellowstone she had never been in the high West , and she liked it . The towns they stayed in were another matter , for once they left the circuit , Jim developed almost an obsession for staying in the smallest towns he could find , towns even the chain motels had not heard of . They stayed in Grangeville , Mobridge , Killdeer , Swift Current , Cody , Belle Fourche , Pagosa Springs , St. Onge . Accommodations tended to be weird  --  it was Patsy 's word . " Do n't call this primitive , " she said one night . They were in an old railroad hotel in Nebraska and a train had come through and had seemed to pass right underneath them . " Primitive life was never this noisy . " Some places had no movie theaters , and such theaters as there were seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little incongruous to see sixties movies in them . Patsy took walks and 139  | got stared at . She read the box of paperbacks from top to bottom , got dangerously far into the third volume of Gibbon , and began to ration herself and subsist on what she could pick up at drugstores . They decided to go to Calgary , mostly because Patsy wanted to see the Canadian Rockies , but the Ford picked that week to throw a rod and they spent two days in Lewiston , Montana , waiting for a part to come by bus from Great Falls . The country they drove through was cool and high , gray distance in the mornings , brown distance at noontime , blue distance in the evenings . Patsy came to love the distances and often sat for long periods watching the wavering horizon . Jim 's picture-taking grew increasingly lackadaisical and they had little to do but talk , read , drive , and eat . It was a month-long period of calm . The argument they had had in Phoenix left them both feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more considerate sexually and the next time they made love they were more considerate than enthusiastic . After that the driving seemed to sap them . They lived and slept together in placid , friendly chastity for three weeks , neither bothered , neither discontent . Jim had been very taken with Eleanor and had fantasies of her for a while , but he had only seen her the once and her memory soon began to fade . The period of calm ended abruptly one night in a small town in northern Colorado . Jim went out to mail some postcards to their folks and completely forgot to bring back some cold cream Patsy had requested . He had also forgotten magazines  --  an essential of life . Patsy had suspected he would forget , since he often did , and had written him a little list , but he stuck the list in his shirt pocket and thought no more about it until he walked in the door of the motel room and saw her look up at him expectantly . " Oh , no , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew it , " she said coldly . " Just give me the car keys . I 'll get them myself . " Jim offered to go , but she left without another word as he was apologizing . It was a tiny town , just one drugstore and a couple of grocery stores and one or two other small-town enterprises . Patsy got her stuff and drove restlessly back and forth through the little town , fuming . Dogs ran out to bark at the car . The town was in a flat valley , with mountains to the west , just visible in the dusk .  | There was really no place to linger , and after ten minutes she gave up and went back to the motel , the only accommodation the town boasted and one that was not to her liking . The walls were peeling , the neck of the shower hung crookedly , so that she practically had to stand in the bedroom to get wet , and there was no air conditioning . The room was cool in the morning , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was hot . Jim looked up guiltily when she came in and he tried again to apologize . " Oh , quit apologizing , " she said . " I forgive you . I knew you had a bad memory when I married you . What I did n't know was that you 'd take me to towns like this , with no warning . " " What do you mean , no warning ? We 've been staying in towns like this for weeks . You 're getting soft . " The remark infuriated her . " Of course I 'm soft , " she said . " I was born soft . I 'm not going to lead a crusade or anything . I 'm just a woman . " " I did n't mean that , " Jim said , annoyed by her tone . " I mean soft in the wrong way . You like luxuries too much . " " Hush , you hypocrite , " she said , shucking off her dress . She flopped across the bed in her bra and panties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had . She felt more like arguing than reading . " It 's steaming in here , " she said . " I 'm sweating . You 're heartless and a hypocrite . You like money more than I do . You love being able to spend hundreds on cameras and stuff any time you decide your lens is inadequate , but then you think you can make up for it by staying in sleazy motels and living on corn dogs . I 'll never eat another corn dog as long as I live . " She had just eaten a corn dog for supper . " I did n't make you eat that corn dog , " he said . " The drive-in had other things . You can eat what you damn please . " " Corn dogs are just my rallying point , " she said . " It 's the principle I 'm attacking . I should never have married you . " She flipped the pages of the magazine angrily . " You 're a puritan and a hypocrite and you wear your goddamn underwear three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always thought I 'd marry a man with the decency to change his underwear every day . Squalor is all I have to look forward to , squalor and neglect . " Jim felt guilty for having forgotten the things , and he let the accusations  | break over his head . She did n't sound seriously angry . Since he was directly behind her , sitting at a little lampstand that was all the room had in the way of a desk , her spleen was actually being directed at the headboard of the bed . He was writing in a journal that he had decided to keep . Sometimes he felt that he was more of a writer than a photographer , and the journal might come in handy . Besides , there was nothing else to do until bedtime . Looking up , he caught an exciting hind view of Patsy as she lay on the sheets of the thin bed . Her legs were wide and she held one foot in the air , waving it erratically as she talked . A small tuft of dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased writing in the journal and began to doodle , and he looked at the rear view of Patsy again and got up and locked the door . " I wish I had read Helen Gurley Brown sooner , " Patsy said . " I 'm sure she has some very practical ideas . Probably I should have been promiscuous when I was younger . I might have learned about men who do n't change their underwear . According to this magazine , sex is everything . " " It would be everything if you lived in a town like this , " Jim said . He sat down by her and ran his hand up her leg and underneath her . " Quit , " she said . " That was not a cue . I was merely remarking on a cultural phenomenon . I 'm really glad I was n't promiscuous and I do n't feel sexy right now . " But Jim kept on rubbing her through her panties , intent on changing the way she felt . Patsy kept reading , feeling irritated , impolite , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " Stop , " she said . " Go take pictures of small-town emptiness , or something . " " You 're getting sexier , " he said . " Well , you 're not getting any more inventive . You 've used that line for six months . Go away and suffer . You ca n't afford luxuries like sex . It would only weaken you as an artist . Sublimate . I 'm reading and I do n't feel sexy . " " I 'm your husband , " Jim said , annoyed . " I 'm your husband , " she mimicked . " I 'm sweaty and this bed is lousy and I have to read this and find out why sex is everything . I have the right to abstain if I want to and I choose to abstain . " " All you ever want to do is abstain , " he said , trying to roll her  | panties down her hips . Patsy thwarted him by rolling off the bed . She went in the tiny bathroom , shut the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she came out fifteen minutes later , soaked with sweat , Jim was in bed looking aggrieved . " You certainly do n't seem to find me very attractive , " he said . " I doubt you really love me any more . " " Do n't lie there pitying yourself , " she said . " It just makes me worse . I wish I had a milkshake . With all the cows around here you 'd think there 'd be milkshakes available . " But after a time she grew contrite and decided she was mean and bitchy and worked it so she got seduced . Jim was grateful and sweet , but also uncharacteristically slow . They were very sweaty and the bed was creaky and not at all firm . After a time , wondering what was wrong , Patsy turned her face toward him and saw from the rather strained look of pleasure on his face that he was considerately holding himself back , waiting for her . " Oh , do n't look like that , " she said . " I 'd rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She felt suddenly furious and hopeless . Jim was startled , stopped moving , and then began again uncertainly . Patsy felt contrite at her outburst and gripped his shoulders , trying to get with him . But they had both become self-conscious and slipped further and further out of rhythm . Jim came and hardly felt it and Patsy simply gave up . She threw her arms wide on the bed and lay panting , shaken with a combination of frustration and hopelessness . Jim was silent and very depressed and Patsy cried a little and when he said nothing began to feel angry . " Move , " she said , just as he was about to . " I 'm drowning in sweat . You can give me the silent treatment after I 've showered , if you insist . " " I 'm not giving you any kind of treatment , " he said . " Not the kind I thought I 'd get when I married you , " she said , going to the bathroom . The shower was cold and left her feeling edgy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim was dressing , as if he meant to go somewhere , and it crossed her mind for a moment that he had stopped loving her  --  probably with justice  --  and was about to abandon her in a miserable little town in Colorado . He was looking for a sock that had been kicked under the bed . All he had on was a brown short-sleeved sports shirt and one brown sock .  | " Why are you dressing ? " " I 'm going out . " He found the sock and sat on the edge of the bed to put it on . " I hope you at least put some underwear on . Where are you going ? Out where ? " " Just out . Away from your nagging tongue . " " There 's nothing but prairie out there . You 'll get snake-bitten . " " Snake-bit . " " Oh , hell . Bitten by a snake . Or else lost . Why do you want to embarrass me by getting lost ? I 'll probably have to hire a search party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wo n't get lost . You 're no one to talk to me about anything . You nag me and you do n't like to sleep with me . I do n't know what 's wrong with you . You do n't even like for me to see you naked . " Patsy had been holding a towel in front of her loins but she yanked it up and flung it at him . It draped over his shoulder but he shrugged it to the floor . " There , I 'm naked , " she said . " Peer all you like , you 're nothing but a goddamn voyeur anyway . An amateur voyeur . Take pictures of me if you want to . You think I 'm frigid just because I do n't come the minute you want me to . I can do it fine if you just let me do it like I like to and not bother with me so much . Get out and get lost ? I want you to . I do n't want you coming near me again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . You always manage to make me feel I 'm no good . " " Shut up , " she said . " You 're just feeling sorry for yourself . What do you think I am , some kind of applause meter ? Look at me ! " And she stuck one leg out and pointed to herself . " See . I 'm just a woman . I 'm not equipped with any gauge that registers how great you are . " " Let 's quit , " he said dejectedly . " I did n't mean it that way . " But Patsy felt wild and violent . She picked the Cosmopolitan off the floor and flung it at the wall of the room . " To hell with sex , " she said . " I wish I 'd been a nun and never got involved with it at all . " " Hush , " Jim said . He was putting on his underwear . " I will not , " she said . " I 'd rather never do it than have to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were nuts ever to 144  | worship it . I think I 'll write an article called Phooey on the Penis ' and send it to that stupid magazine . " " My , you 're witty , " Jim said . His voice was so wretched that it broke Patsy 's anger , though her bosom continued to heave . She sighed and went over and put her head on his chest and hugged him . " You poor man , " she said . " What an unlucky day for you when you married me . How could you suspect I 'd turn out soft and frigid ? I 'm sorry I talked so mean . " Jim was relieved . Instead of going out he undressed again and they got back in bed and chatted and were friendly . " I wish we could forget about all this , " Patsy said , her head on his arm . " Maybe if we forget about it for a while we can start over and everything will work . " " Maybe , " Jim said , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , all unexpectedly , only two nights later , their sexual fortunes changed for the better . Late in the afternoon they crossed Berthoud Pass  --  crossed it at a speed of two miles an hour , in reverse . The Ford was not at its strongest and refused to take the pass in second or even in low , and Jim had to resort to backing over , while behind them a string of cars and trucks waited and watched , the drivers surprisingly patient , even amused . Patsy felt the center of all eyes . It was very ignominious to have to back over a mountain , and had she not been nervous and scared she would have been angry . " Fool ! Idiot ! " she kept saying . " Why ca n't we get a new car ? " She kept her dark glasses on and tried to look unconcerned and inscrutable . Jim tended grimly to his backing and ignored her . When they finally topped the pass he turned around and drove downward a few miles to a little mountain town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were edgy  --  Jim had been a little scared too . " I want a new car , " Patsy said . " I really insist . Our very life was in danger . " " Nonsense , " Jim said . " You 're too cowardly . Besides , that must have been the highest pass in the Rockies . We just wo n't come this way again . " " I sure wo n't , not in this heap of junk , " she said . " I did n't see anyone else backing over . Most people have strong cars . You 're insanely stubborn , Jim . " 145  | " You 're insanely bitchy , " he said , not yielding an inch . They ate a silent supper , each determined not to weaken , but the little cafe where they ate was so unexpectedly jolly that they could n't stay low-spirited . It was bright and noisy and paneled in pine . The kitchen threw out good smells , and the place was packed with a score or more of loggers and truck drivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hard to be depressed around them . The stew they had was excellent , and that helped too . When they stepped outside it was dark and very cold and they walked up the highway for a mile or more , smelling the pine trees and the mountains . They were so high that even the height itself seemed to have a smell . They were both shivering , and Jim put his arm around her . " Those were the first actual loggers I 've ever seen , " Patsy said . " They even wore plaid shirts , like loggers in books . I like this place , even if we did endanger our lives getting here . " She took his hand and they walked back to their motel . Besides the cafe , there was only the motel , one filling station , and a drugstore that doubled as a bus depot . As they passed it a Greyhound bus pulled away and the faces of the passengers looked down at them enviously . They went to the cabin and read awhile . Then , unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked back across the highway to the cafe and had pie and coffee . The cafe was as full as ever , and the men still as boisterous and jolly . Patsy became infected with happiness suddenly , in the way she sometimes did . The loggers kept looking at her , which caused her to flush , and she became very animated . Her eyes shone . She and Jim sat at their table for almost an hour , talking of old friends , rehashing parties they had been to in college , and reminiscing about their honeymoon . It had been to Bermuda and had not been especially successful , but in retrospect it seemed charmingly silly and nice to remember . The cabin was ice cold when they got back . The bed had real quilts on it , the sheets too were very cold , and the darkness cold around them . They snuggled together , shivery and goose-bumpy for a minute . Jim slipped his hand between her cold thighs and Patsy eagerly opened her legs and then closed them to squeeze his hand against her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his surprise she wanted to be touched . He had ceased to believe that she would  | ever want him to touch her , but he did and she was immediately responsive and soon twisted her gown up . No sooner had they begun to move than the quilts became a problem , their shoulders were cold and their feet uncovered . The quilts had bunched in the center of the bed , but they were , for once , so warmly into the act of love that they could ignore the quilts . Patsy came more strongly than she had in months , her legs hooked over Jim 's , and they had both sunk almost into sleep when the cold brought them up from it . " We 're freezing , " he said . They hopped up by mutual consent and hurriedly straightened the quilts and tucked them in . Then they snuggled close again . The next morning they woke early and huddled under the quilts for a long time , staring at the ceiling . It was very cold , and instead of smelling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always a chatterer in the mornings , was unusually quiet and stroked Jim 's shoulder from time to time . " We should live here , " she said softly . " Perhaps you could become a logger . I like the idea of your having something to do with logs . Cowboys are just about as wooden , and logs smell better . " " Nope , " Jim said without elaboration . Patsy looked out the window at the highway . Cars were going by . The sun had not yet risen above the peaks , and the mountains were gray , with white mist between the pines . " I was n't really meant to ramble , " she said . " If we are n't going to live here I ought to go on back to Houston and wait there for you to finish your rodeo travels . " " But it 's more fun with you along . " " Not really . I get too ugly . Everything gets disorderly when you 're always moving . I lose control too easily . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " You do n't especially like Houston , do you ? " Patsy sat up and bent to raise the window so she could smell the morning . The cold raised goose-bumps on her warm arms and breasts . " No , but I 'm changing , " she said . " I 'm ready to stop traveling . " Jim reached up and pulled her back under the covers until only her ears and nose and forehead showed . " I want you close at hand , " he said . " It wo n't be too much longer . We 're going back to the 147
