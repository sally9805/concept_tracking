Wine lovers have long cultivated their own peculiar vocabulary . A vintage can be " flinty , " " robust " or even " amusingly presumptuous . " Never , however , has a wine been discussed in terms of its lemon , lime or coconut flavor . Never , that is , until now . Flavored " pop " wines have arrived and are showing up on liquor-store shelves in ever-increasing numbers and varieties . <P> The names of the new favorites are in themselves enough to give any true wine lover the pip : Zapple and Boone 's Farm ( both apple wines ) , Bali Hai and Key Largo ( orange , papaya and other fruit extracts ) , Spaada ( grape ) , three different blends that are jointly named I Love You ( " I " tastes like lemon-lime , " Love " is fruity and " You " has a cola flavor ) , Ripple ( grape wine and tropical fruits ) and Annie Greensprings ( a grape ros ) .

" I do n't think they should be considered wines . They 're just soft drinks with alcohol . " <P> Pop-wine aficionados have an answer for such snobbery : flavored wines have been around for a long time . Spaniards favor sangria , made of red wine and fruit juices ; French and Italian sweet vermouths are simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retsina . Indeed , products like Thunderbird ( a citrus-flavored wine that is 18% alcohol ) have been on U.S. shelves for more than a decade . These cheap , more potent brands should continue to sell , mostly to the Skid Row set , despite the pop-wine invasion . What would a serious wino want , after all , with a low-alcohol tipple called Annie Greensprings ?
