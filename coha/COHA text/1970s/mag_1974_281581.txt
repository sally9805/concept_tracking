As President Ford last week unveiled his program to permit Viet Nam War evaders and deserters to earn their way back into U.S. society , he termed it " an act of mercy to bind the nation 's wounds and to heal the scars of divisiveness . " But the wounds bled anew . Leaders of veterans ' organizations immediately denounced the plan as " a gross injustice " to those who had served , died , and suffered . Members of war resisters ' groups assailed it as a " punitive " assault upon men who had been guilty only of " premature morality . " Yet Ford 's plan , an extremely complex attempt to resolve a national dilemma , doubtless reflected the middle position of most Americans on the issue . <P> Certainly , there are inequities in Ford 's program , which had been opposed as too gentle by the Justice and Defense Departments and some Congressmen . It falls well short of the blanket postwar amnesty that past Presidents extended , and few were rushing to accept it until they could figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leniency stressed by Ford prevails over the fairly harsh provisions of the plan , many exiles may return . If the plan is rigidly applied , relatively few may do so . <P> The key question is whether returnees from abroad and the U.S. underground will have to serve the full two years in low-paying public-service jobs . Ford 's proclamation requires that the jobs be in fields that " promote the national health , safety or interest " - in hospitals , forests , schools and public institutions , usually as menial laborers . <P> Uncertainty arises because the plan empowers officials to reduce a term on the vague basis of past " honorable service , penalties already paid under law , and such other mitigating factors as may be appropriate to seek equity . " These judgments will be made by regional U.S. Attorneys or a military Joint Alternative Service Board at Indiana 's Fort Benjamin Harrison under general guidelines from their Washington superiors . The scheme is designed to minimize inequities stemming from local prejudice . <P> Incredible Oversight . The plan for handling deserters contains two sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only deserters must take an oath reaffirming their allegiance to the U.S. ; 2 ) through an incredible oversight ( privately admitted by the Pentagon but publicly denied as a mistake by the Justice Department ) , deserters can escape serving the alternate public-service work . They will be given " undesirable discharges " and must pledge to take a compensatory job , but will lose only the benefit of changing their discharge to one termed a " clemency discharge " if they fail to do so . Neither type of discharge is a legal barrier to employment in civilian jobs ; both deny veterans ' benefits to the holder . Few deserters are likely to find two years of enforced labor worth the distinction .
