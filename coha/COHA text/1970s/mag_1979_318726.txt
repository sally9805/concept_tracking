In ancient days , before Watergate made Woodward and Bernstein household words , investigative reporting meant Drew Pearson . He was , as TIME said then , " the most in tensely feared and hated man in Washington . " From the ' 30s to the ' 60s , scoops in his syndicated column ( " Wash ington Merry-Go-Round " ) or on his Sunday radio broad casts became headlines : the Roosevelt court-packing plan , F.D.R. 's destroyers-for-bases swap with Churchill , the Patton soldier-slapping incident , Sherman Adams ' vicuna coat and many other tales , worthy and less worthy . <P> In a new book , Confessions of a Muckraker ( Random House ; $12.95 ) , the late columnist 's protege and successor , Jack Anderson ( writing with James Boyd ) , acknowledges that Pearson 's " success and power rested in large measure in the practiced impugning of others . " The book is a lively recall of triumphs that brought down the mighty , but it gains unexpected depth from Anderson 's confession of troubled self-doubts . It is no great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporting , as its critics and victims have long insisted , often produces sordid victories . <P> Many of Pearson 's methods would n't be tolerated today . He really went after people . He taught Anderson to look " first for those personal weaknesses ... to cher ish in an adversary : overweening vanity , bumbling pomposity , addiction to creature comforts , a tendency to alcoholic indiscretion , the heedless pursuit of venery . " Opponents were destroyed not by reasoned argument but by a recital of their peccadilloes , endlessly repeated . When Ander son objected to such " scraps and chaff , " his boss replied : " Once you catch one of these birds at anything , and you 're sure of your facts , never worry about doing him an injustice by overplaying it . We 'll never learn 10% of the evil they do . "
