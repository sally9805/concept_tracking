txt Letter , pg . SM12 Letters FAMILY THERAPY AND MOMMY To THE EDITOR : Hooray for Dr. Ackerman and his family therapy ( " To Treat a Disturbed Person , Treat His Family , " by Sara Davidson , Aug. 16 ) . In the tradition of the so-called helping professions , the treatment is great for daddy and the ( male ) kids , but mommy had better watch out . For example , Dr. Ackerman 's success with the Ross family . Mrs. Linda Ross " gained two master 's degrees , " and " then went back to Columbia to take more graduate courses . " She was still , however , a troubled woman . Perhaps the explanation is that she was accumulating credits , with no plan in the world to enter society and use her talents . After therapy , however , she states : " Having a family is all there is . " The Ross family troubles sound typical : " Linda ran the house and made most of the decisions concerning the children . " Her husband " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being away so much , and also , I was lazy . I thought she was doing a good job . And our house was not a matriarchy . I was always the last judge . When Daddy said Boo , everybody jumped . " The Ackerman solution to a woman 's jumping when Daddy says Boo ( despite her 100 hours of- graduate credit ) , is apparently not an end to male supremacy . After the " cure , " Linda said : " I realized I 'd been fighting my role as wife and mother all these years . " Their sex life blossomed . " It 's an absolute miracle , " her husband says . " This semifrigid woman became a sex bomb . " No wonder the younger daughter still cries in her room : she understands the fate in store for her . I suggest-Mrs . Ross and her two daughters STRIKE against their family therapy ; stop paying $75 an hour ( plus private therapy fees ) to " learn " their role . The woman 's liberation movement welcomes you ! KAREN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Syracuse , N. Y. THE MARIJUANA GAP To THE EDITOR : Man , I 'm not out of it just because I 'm over 30 and make a bundle , man , because I smoke pot . We liberal adults // Letters // know that that is where it 's at , man , and we can dig it , man . This appeared to be the sentiment in Sam Blum 's " Marijuana Clouds the Generation Gap " ( Aug. 23 ) and - it was sickening . Adults can use marijuana because they are mature individuals who are in complete control of themselves , knowing when they 've reached enough of a high and yet are aware of what they are doing . Sometimes their sexual activity is improved and generally it makes them feel good . It is an accepted thing in America just like tobacco , alcohol , and apple pie . Those little side effects like sometimes feeling paranoid or turning on to harder stuff when marijuana is n't around is nothing to worry about . It 's - chic , you know ... ALISON H. POLLACK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE EDITOR : Regarding " Coming Wednesday : A Herstory-Making Event " ( about the women 's strike for equality , by Judy Klemesrud , Aug. 23 ) I think Betty Friedan should not be so quick to shun comparisons to Lysistrata . In Mrs. Friedan 's list of grievances , she made no mention of the greatest outrage perpetrated on woman by man ? impregnation with a child that she chooses to bear , not abort , to care for with or without the aid of a childcare center , and then be forced to contribute that child 's life to a meaningless war game played by cynical old men . Perhaps Betty Friedan doesnl care for Lysistrata 's bedroom tactics , but certainly Lysistrata 's aims were much higher than Mrs. Friedan 's ? to eliminate the most savage affront to womanhood  --  the male-ordered destruction of the fruits . of her body and love . If women of the world were to trulyunite and refuse to bear another child until war was outlawed , then we would have a cause that mould be supported by women . of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. KESSNER . Valley Stream , N. Y. ANOTHER LOOK RACK AT THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC To THE EDITOR : , No two historical periods are precisely parallel , but the similarities between the Weimar Republic and our own situation have been frightening for some time . Walter Laqueur indicates some of these more or less well ( " A Look Back- at the Weimar Republic  --  the Cry Was ' Down With das System , ' " Aug. 16 ) , but the details ( which remind me of the techniques of handwriting analysis ) do n't interest me as much as an astonishing paragraph near the beginning of the piece , which attempts to remove the hornet 's sting with the suggestion that " political comparisons are not very helpful . " The paragraph tries to ease our fears by displaying differences between our situation and Weimar ; yet of the six differences , only one is accurate , while the rest are really five further ( and ominous ) similarities . " The United States was not defeated in a world war . " We are in the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more humiliating and much more dangerous , and the stab-in-the-back brigade has already started to echo the German military complaints of the twenties . " Aggressive nationalism and revanchism are not the main issues at stake today . " Possibly The Times should reprint those hardhat-cum-flag photos every week until people begin to notice them ; together with the Nixon - cum - hardhat photos . And are we no longer interested in maintaining Japan 's economic and military dependence on us ? And have we really ; given up our economicdesigns on Cuba ? " Democracy in America is not a foreign importation of recent date . " True ! True ! It is , , instead , a foreign importation of distant date , which is being dangerously taken for granted . " The extreme right in America-is not a great dynamic force . " Reading ' from the bottom up , Wallace , Thurmond , Goldwater and Buckley are the first examples who come to mind of a dynamic and hydra - headed right currently much more vocal and effective than the left . " Racialism is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jackson State , Bobby Seale gagged in. court . School integration slowdown , cutbacks in Federal self-help program . " The American crisis is not the result of a major economic crisis . " This at a time when the New York Stock Exchange lost one-third of its paper value in a year , unemployment is rising , inflation has reached better than half a per cent a month and continues to increase , and Penn Central , - Chrysler , Lockheed and a host of similar companies are being shored up by flimsy buttresses that seem unlikely to last the night . Mr. Laqueur may be conversant with the decade of Weimar , but on the basis of that one paragraph he would appear to have spent the most recent decade somewhere outside the solar system . DONALD E. WESTLAKE . ? Branchville , N. J. GENERAL WHITNEY AND - THE OCCUPATION To THE EDITOR : Re your article " Faubion Hewers Makes A Mud Pie " ( " Twenty - five Years Ago ? How Japan Won the War , " by Faubion Bowers , Aug. 30 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cigar . Nor was he known for his apoplexy or shouting at people Mr. Bowers wrote : " . . . fat , puffy Gen. Courtney Whitney . . . . When the Japanese presented Whitney a list of a thousand people to be purged , he huffed , ' Give me 300,000 like Germany . . . . Whitney appeared at the council flushed and apoplectic , shouted at them end proceeded . . . . Whitney is supposed to have threatened to use another atom bomb on Japan . Yoshida says he threatened to destroy the Emperor . . . .1 ; in fact , I never heard his voice raised at all , except perhaps to laugh at a stand-up comic , a response which the hysterical opus " How Japan , etc. " might have provoked . Does the author see Whitney scaling Mount Fuji , hurling his " bomb " at the villages below and calling down his personal bolt of lightning on the figure of the Emperor to " destroy " him ? And as for his charge that my father was fat ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Faubsey could have used a few situps himself . If only to reduce his imaginative flab . RICHARD WHITNEY . New York . To THE EDITOR : Major Bowers . . . does n't mention the Japanese occupation of Manchuria where 12 million people were slaughtered , the rape of Shanghai , the Bataan March , the occupation of the Philippines . What about their introducing bacteriological warfare when it was used in Burma  --  and Southeast Asia ? Or is this too unimportant to mention ? What would he prefer ? an occupation like that of the Germans in Poland , or Russians as in Czechoslovakia or Hungary , or even like the Japanese in Manchuria ? As the Japanese have said , they are enjoying unlimited and unbelievable success as a result of our occupation . FRANK A. GONZALES . New York . Mr. Bowers replies : Of course , little Richard has to defend his late , unlamented father . For this I give him full marks . However , his memory of his father at least in those occupation days errs . He did huff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . As for Mr. Gonzalez , after Songmy can we possibly ever assert that kind of nationalistic , holier-than-thou superiority again ? Besides , Shanghai was never raped ; Nanking was . ( I recommend a brand-new book , soon to be published , " The Rising Sun , " by Toland , which will focus his brainwashed eyes . ) Obviously I would hate for Japan to have won the war and occupied Tulsa , Okla . My point is that all occupations are bad , because all wars are bad , and so are all defeats and victories .
