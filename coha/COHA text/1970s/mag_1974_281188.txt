What may well be the nation 's ultimate singles war is not on Sunset Strip or Manhattan 's Upper East Side but in Bloomington , Minn. , a suburb of Minneapolis . Every night hundreds and sometimes thousands of singles from all over the Midwest jam the Left Guard , a giant , 27,000-sq. - ft. club owned in part by two former stars of the Green Bay Packers , Fuzzy Thurston and Max McGee . TIME Correspondent Richard Woodbury recently made the scene at the Left Guard His report : <P> By 8:30 p.m. , when the band show up , the 90-ft bar is already mobbed . The crowd has taken all the tables in sight and is beginning to spill out into the Swingers Lounge , a dining area where the more sedate can come to eat and watch the goings-on . Stewardesses and secretaries sit in forced conversation with one another , nursing their " sloe screws " ( sloe gin and orange juice ) and " thigh openers " ( vodka gimlets ) and feigning unawareness of the males all about . Behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweaters lounge against the wall , cradling bottles of beer and looking over the pickings . " I 've never seen anything like this , " say Cindy Barton , 22 from Estherville , Iowa . " There is nothing in Sioux City to measure up to it . " <P> What sets the Left Guard apart from East and West Coast singles bars is the size of its facilities and its crowds . The club has three bards , four rooms and a 600-car parking lot , even so , the cars often overflow into adjacent streets . <P> Once the Guard has reached its capacity of 2,000 , singles-and those pretending to be singles-wait patiently in lines 100 deep , even in subfreezing temperatures . Some of them come from as far away as North Dakota , Upper Michigan and Wisconsin . <P> There is a saying among Minneapolis singles that " if you ca n't make it at the Guard , you ca n't make it anywhere . " Says Mai Kennedy , a Wisconsin attorney : " It 's a sultan 's haven . If you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does one start ? ' " Females are equally enthusiastic . " I get ten offers a night , " boasts Kathy Thue , 23 , a beauty adviser from Minneapolis . " The body friction is enough to get everyone going . " <P> The Guard has a ruggedly masculine decor . Large black-and-white action photos of the Minnesota Vikings adorn the walls . Near the bar is a football souvenir shop called the Pro Central , and the young , long-haired and busty bar girls wear football jerseys with their names printed across the front . Because the football stadium and hockey arena are only a mile away , Viking and Minnesota North Star heroes often drop in after games . When they do , heads turn and female bodies surge forward . " Our theme is built around violence , " says Manager Larry Thiel . " Women seem captivated by the manliness of the place . " <P> Burly Crew . Despite the crush at the Guard , fights rarely erupt . A burly crew of five bouncers keeps order , ousting patrons who utter even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A strict dress code outlaws Levi 's , tank tops and cutoffs . These rules apparently appeal to the clientele that seeks out the club : a conservatively dressed crowd of nurses and schoolteachers , pilots , salesmen and junior executives .
