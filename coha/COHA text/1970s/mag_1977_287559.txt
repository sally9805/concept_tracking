SADAT 'S JOURNEY IS A SUCCESS , trumpeted Cairo 's al Ahram . A predictable reaction for a government-controlled paper , to be sure . But true enough , for the host as well as his guest . <P> Jimmy Carter and Anwar Sadat had never met before , so they boned up on each other before the Egyptian President arrived in Washington last week . Sadat , the first in a series of Arab leaders whom Carter will meet this spring ( next : Jordan 's King Hussein and Syria 's President Hafez Assad ) , had wondered , for example , whether Carter 's commitment to Christianity obtruded on his views of the Middle East ( Answer : no ) . Carter had commented to an aide that from his reading Sadat appeared to be " a fascinating character . " One foreign policy aide gave Carter a short lecture on the importance that Arabs attach to good personal chemistry between leaders . <P> In this case , the chemistry seemed to work well . The two men spent a total of five hours in discussions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following a " working dinner " in the Egyptian 's honor . At the close of the three-day visit , Sadat pronounced himself satisfied with the results . In a TV interview , he declared warmly , if not quite idiomatically , that Carter was a " sweet " man who had gone " straight to my heart . " <P> Not that the two agreed on all particulars . Carter has suggested that in a Middle East settlement Israel might be permitted to maintain some kind of defense lines beyond its actual borders . Nothing doing , said Sadat . " Sovereignty is indivisible . We ca n't have two borders . " Sadat did soften his position.on Israel , however , saying that he envisaged full normalization of relations between Israel and the Arab states within about five years of the signing of a peace agreement . Previously , he had said only that Israel 's security would be guaranteed , not that normal diplomatic relations would be established . Sadat pressed Carter hard to recognize and deal with the Palestine Liberation Organization , and was obviously pleased at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a spokesman at a reconvened Geneva peace conference . <P> Further Evidence . Sadat told Defense Secretary Harold Brown of Egypt 's desire to buy F-5E fighter planes and TOW antitank missiles from the U.S. He got no firm answer , and probably will not until the National Security Council completes a review of foreign arms sales later this month . <P> Even if he does not get the hardware , Sadat will count the visit a success . " All in all , " reported TIME Correspondent Wilton Wynn from Cairo , " the trip is viewed from here as further evidence that Sadat 's policy of moderation and seeking the closest of ties with the U.S. has been vindicated.
