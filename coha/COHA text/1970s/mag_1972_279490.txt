The American dream lived in John Alessio . Son of an impoverished coal miner , he is a grade-school dropout and a onetime bootblack who became a millionaire with diverse interests in banking , real estate and restaurants in California and horse racing , dog racing and legalized bookmaking in Mexico . One of his enterprises was the erection of a twelve-story office building on the very same street in San Diego where he used to shine the shoes of C. Arnholt Smith , a fund-raising friend of Richard Nixon and Alessio 's mentor and business associate . Alessio , named " Mr. San Diego " of 1964 by a local civic group , appreciates having friends in high places . In 1968 , after years of contributing to Democratic campaigns , Alessio switched to the favorite and donated $26,000 to the winner . <P> As befits a man who attended Nixon 's Inaugural Ball , " Big John " Alessio was a seemingly model citizen-president of the Tijuana Rotary Club , a director of the San Diego Convention and Visitors Bureau , recipient of an honorary doctorate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to be immodest , " Alessio once said , " but I 've been a wonderful fellow . " <P> Hanky-Panky . The Internal Revenue Service , which began an investigation into Alessio 's financial dealings six years ago , did not think so . Despite reported special pleading on his behalf that delayed the inquiry , Big John , three of his six brothers and his son were indicted for failing to report $1.2 million of taxable income . Big John and Brother Angelo finally pleaded guilty last year ( charges against the others were dropped ) and received sentences of three years and one year respectively . <P> Hanky-panky , however , seems to have continued . Last week a federal grand jury in San Diego and Los Angeles indicted Big John and Angelo , their brother Tony and John 's son Dominic for conspiring to bribe a guard and other prison officials in exchange for certain favors that made their prison stay rather fun . A week prior , another grand jury in San Diego indicted Angelo , Tony , Dominic and two prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor camp " in Lompoc , Calif. , a kind of penal country club for a handful of privileged convicts , the Alessios lost no time in buttering up the guards . On different occasions , according to the indictment , the Alessios arranged a free weekend at a resort hotel in Stateline , Nev. , for one parole officer and his family ; they treated another prison official to a lavishly catered sojourn at the Kona Kai , a San Diego club controlled by Smith . Another time Tony Alessio hosted a fishing trip for a guard and three of his friends that ended with a surprise bonus : two nude prostitutes who came dancing out of the bathroom in their motel suite .
