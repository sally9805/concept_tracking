txt IT 'S THE LATE Mos or HO . Your rusty jalopy has belched its last , and you 're forced to shop for a new car . Here 's what you likely will encounter : ? Cars will be smaller , lighter , and more fuel-efficient . They 'll tend to look alike , thinly disguised versions of the same basic , boxy design . ? Not only will they look alike , but cars will share more standard parts and components , including " black box " electronic controls that will monitor the eagine and diagnose problems . ? You may be forced to buy two cars ? a two-seater commuter car that you 'll drive to work because It gets 50 to 60 miles per gallon , and a family ear for weekends and vacations that will be no larger than current compacts such as Ford Motor Co.

You may be able to select only models made by four or five world-ear manufacturers , including General Motors Corp. , Ford , Volkswagen , a national Japanese automaker , and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be Chrysler Corp . and American Motors Corp . THAT 'S not a forecast or a prediction , but an amalgamated picture of what the United States auto industry could look like towards the end of the next decade , based on interviews by The Tribune with Wall Street auto analysts , economists , and Detroit auto executives . The future and viability of the domestic auto industry became more relevant last week after Chrysler , the nation 's third largest automaker and 11th largest industrial company , announced a record *207.1 million second-quarter loss and signaled that more red ink was coming later this year . Although it had been laying the ground work for weeks In Washington , Chrysler also shocked the business world lost week by begging for a lion rescue by the federal government . There are no assurances , however , that Chrysler will be bailed out by the government , and some suggest that a huge infusion of funds wo n't help the ailing automaker anyway .

" THUS , an increasing number of executives in Detroit are facing up to the possibility of having essentially a twocompany U.S. auto industry . The autobuying public , they contend , will hardly . notice the evolution into a two-company business because both foreign and domestic models qttickly will fill the void left by the demise of a Chrysler Corp. , which only sold about one in every 10 new cars in the U.S. last year . The consensus of auto observers both Inside anti outside Detroit , however , is that the government wo n't allow Chrysler to go into bankruptcy . " A Chrysler bankruptcy and the remilting layoffs just would n't sit too well with the American public right now , " says David Eisenberg , auto analyst with . Sanford C. Bernstein &; Co. , New York . " It would affect thousands of lives . " SPECIFICALLY , the collapse of Chrysler would be traumatic to Detroit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a whole at a time when many economists think the country is already in a recession , or prolonged period of declining growth . Chrysler employs about 200,00a workers worldwide . In the Detroit area alone , the company has more than a dozen major facilities employing nearly 28,000 workers , many of them blacks . Another 10,000 Chrysler workers in Detroit already have been laid off due to the recent gasoline crunch-induced sales slump , says a United Auto Workers spokesman . Chrysler 's most modern , efficient carassembly plant at Belvidere , Ill. , employs 5,000 workers . Were Chrysler to go under , the shock waves would be felt far beyond its direct employes . Just in Michigan , the company provides a major source of business for more than 6,0110 suppliers and vendors . These companies employ about 165,000 people , the UAW says . " A CHRYSLER closedown would play havoc with this town and state for years and years , " said one GM middle manager in Detroit . Adds a vice president of a major supplier to Detroit automakers : " Chrysler is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an employer to let them fail . There will be a constant threat of bankruptcy , however . " Economists also fear that a Chrysler collapse would only aggravate the recession . " We 're in the middle of a recession , " asserts Lee E. Phillips , senior economist at Data Resources , Inc. , a nationally known consulting firm . " If Chrysler is allowed to fall apart , it would be long and painful , and the man on the street would suffer a lot of anxiety . " " Psychologically , it would be very damaging , " agrees one Detroit auto company executive . " It could throw us Into a severe downturn instead of the mild slowdown most of us are anticipating . " CHRYSLER 'S failure also would have widespread political ramifications . " The implications on Washington would he phenomenal , " says Richard L. Hayden , auto analyst for Goldman Sachs &; en . " It would cause Congress to rethink trade legislation , environmental laws , and other areas . " Government bailout and bankruptcy are n't the only alternatives facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a much smaller , pared-down specialty manufacturer of cars . AMC , for example , appears to be enjoying new-found prosperity by concentratin4 in the making of Jeep utility vehicles and planning eventually to market Renault cars built in France . Some Chrysler watchers believe that , if the government does n't aid the company , some foreign auto company eventually will come in and buy it at a bargain-basement price . Volkswagen , the big West German auto maker , apparently was interested at one time , but now the two companies are exploring ways they can build engines and even cars jointly . CHRYSLER also has ties with Tokyo . based Mitsubishi , the world 's largest trading company . Chrysler owns 15 per cent of Mitsubishi Motors Corp . and distributes the company 's cars in the U.S. under such Chrysler brandnames as Dodge Colt and Plymouth Arrow . The Japanese giant has lent Chrysler money and recently bought a one-third interest in Chrysler 's Australian subsidiary , but it is believed that Mitsubishi is unhappy with Chrysler 's problems and would like to sell its own cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it can run a viable company , " says Leon W. Taub , vice president of Chase Econometric Associates , Inc . " But they 're going to be in for a terrible time unless they can get some help on updating their technology . " THE FORCES that Taub believes will make it rough for Chrysler to survive have been in motion for several years , and they have been affecting GM and Ford as well . While Chrysler is floundering , however , GM appears to be gaining strength . The main factors at work in reshaping American-built cars are the fuel economy standards that Congress mandated after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo . Under those laws , automakers must achieve a combined average fuel economy for their cars of 27.5 miles per gallon by 1985 compared with 19 miles per gallon this year . To meet those goals , Detroit has embarked on one of the most spectacular spending sprees in the history of modern business in order to make its ears and engines smaller , lighter , and more fuelstingy . It is estimated that It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The problem is that not everyone started out equally when Washington decided gasoline consumption had to be curtailed , " We 're all spending the money now to get the products on line , " explains one GM official , " but Chrysler was n't in a strong financial position going in , and now they ca n't generate any cash . " CHASE Econometric 's Taub says : " The government unleashed a sleeping giant in GM , and the company has seized upon the regulations as a business opportunity . " Taub and others believe GM is using its superior resources , staff , and management to gain an insurmountable advantage in technology and sales . Since 1975 , GM has been spending at the rate of $3.2 billion a year , and this year it expects to lay out $5.5 billion . Next year , spending will hit $6 billion , and it is expected to be more than $6 billion through the early 1980s . By contrast , analysts estimate that Chrysler needs to spend $1.7 billion between now and 1982 , " They have cut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreements , cut costs , used $550 million of their $750 million in short-term credit lines , but they still face large external financing requirements , " said auto analyst Eisenberg . " Some sort of financial aid is essential . " Adds one Chrysler insider : " We 've already performed major surgery , and we 're still sick . To make matters worse , all the current publicity will only scare buyers away from the showrop . No one wants to own an orphan , "
