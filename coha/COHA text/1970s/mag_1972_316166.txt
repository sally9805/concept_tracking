SMALL CRAFT WARNINGS <P> Yesterday is dead and gone <P> And tomorrow 's out of sight <P> And it 's sad to be alone <P> Help me make it through the night . <P> - Help Me Make It Through the Night , by Kris Kristofferson <P> Many of the scenes in Tennessee Williams ' plays take place at night . For his characters , this is a time of terror . Alone , heart-hungry , desolate of spirit , they reach out for a voice , a touch , any kindly stranger who may help them make it through the night . <P> A bar is a logical place for a convocation of strangers who are terrorized yet basically humane . In the world 's judgment , the characters in Small Craft Warnings are seedy derelicts : a strident middle-aged beautician ( Helena Carroll ) who rarely bathes and whose trailer shack-up is a monosyllabic semi-Neanderthal ( Brad Sullivan ) ; a red-headed hooker ( Cherry Davis ) whose hand is on every man 's groin except that of her woefully plastered boy friend ( William Hickey ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he aborts and a sardonically nihilistic homosexual ( Alan Mixon ) . The world casts stones ; Williams applies the balm of compassion to the bruises . In his eyes and under his poetic alchemy , these people become the embodiment of the fears that course through all of us at some time or other , the frailties that make us lie , betray any trust , cringe before bullies , vilify others-though in our hearts we wish to do none of those things . <P> To these characters , the bar is a spar to which they cling in the shipwreck of existence and over which they confess their hidden better selves . These confessional arias are what they have always been in Williams , eloquent trib utes to the English tongue and moving explorations of the human spirit . This is not to say that Small Craft Warnings is on a par with the durable canon of his finest plays . Here he reminds us of the size and scope of his genius , but dis plays it diminuendo . Call this then a five-finger exercise from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world .
