SPECIAL AGENT ORAL COLE of the Internal Revenue Service 's Criminal intelligence Division read the letter I had given him . It was addressed to me . Dear George : . . . As you know , Nader is very interested in Gary from several points of view . First is the property tax situation there . Second is the fact that you mentioned about possible irregularities in the IRS regional o ? lce . I have talked to Ralph about both subjects and he is extremely interested in receiving information on both . . . . Anything you could get us right away will be appreciated . Samuel Simon , Associate " Good , that 's fine , " Cole said in a slow country drawl . " I 'm sorry to have insisted on the letter but I just do n't trust the Post ? Tribune . " Reporters rarely get secret interviews with IRS agents , but in a manner very closely related to the " property tax situation " in Gary , Cole 's life had just caved in on him , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to see me . Special Agent Cole had once been at the top of his profession . A last-minute report from him to Attorney General Robert Kennedy in 1961 had put the first dent in Gary , Indiana 's corrupt political machine . George Chacharis , the then mayor of Gary and an assiduous deliverer of Kennedy votes in the 1960 campaign , had been chosen to be President Kennedy 's ambassador to Greece . The announcement of his nomination was never made . Cole 's report showed that the Gary may ( was involved in a complex tangle of illegal a , tivities and had failed to report on his feder : income tax returns at least $260,000 worth income from kickbacks on city contracts . I stead of Greece . Chacharis was sent to jail . Cole , meanwhile , was promoted to a job i Washington where he established himself as or of IRS 's best agents . In 1966 he was called bac to Gary to complete an investigation of anoth , machine politician ; this time , however , the were no promotions at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cole 's 1966 probe was Ch charis ' prot ? g ? , the present tax assessor of Cal met Township , Thomas R.

The businessman had fused to bribe Fadell and the assessor had sponded by tripling his company 's tax asses merit . " There 's nothing you can do about ii he had explained matter-of-factly . And inde there was n't much the man could do ; Fadell h become the boss of Chacharis ' political machir and the machine 's influence extended to the pr . ecutor 's office and the courts in Lake Count ) *The machine lost control of the Gary City Hall 1967 when Richard G. Hatcher was elected mayor . I it retained control of I he township and county offs in Lake County and thus control of the machinery criminal justice . Before Cole was assigned to the case , Fadell had sought out the two IRS agents investigating him and threatened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop . When they continued , he followed through with his threat . He then wrote to the IRS regional director demanding that the investigation be halted . " The agents , " he charged , " are guilty of spying , viciousness , arbitrary capriciousness and sham ... of fabricating stories in an attempt to give their odious , illegal actions an aroma of legality . " This was typical language from the man who signed his letters , " From your friendly assessor : " Fadell is the son of a Croatian steelworker . A Marine captain in the Korean war , he still carries himself as if he were in uniform . He was a strug ; ling lawyer in 1958 when Chacharis took him ender his wing and got him elected assessor . From . his advantageous base , Fadell managed , within few short years and on a $12,500-a-year salary , : o assemble a small business empire . As the federal grand jury began to hear evilenee on the case , Special Agent Cole was confilent of the outcome . Yet after hearing evidence or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term exiired without its being asked to vote on returning in indictment . Shortly afterward . Cole 's local upervisors pressured him to close out the case . ie refused to sign the final report and was tempoarily transferred to New York . Several months ater , he was recalled to Gary and charged with . ccepting a gift ( a $35 pool table ) in violation if IRS rules . d Angry and frightened , Cole fought back by equesting support from Washington . He indiated that the IRS 's Indiana regional office Leeded to be investigated and asked for a public iring of his own case . Then Herbert J.

The combination was too hot for Cole 's upervisors . They erased the c ' . -. arges on his offiial records and dropped their case . It was an empty victory fur Cole . He was aleady suffering from acute arthritis and glauulna in his only eye ; the emotional strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , he felt humiliated and betrayed y the organization he had believed in and dented his life to . Soon after I met with him in irly 1971 , he resigned . " So you 're on to Mr. Fadell , " Cole said slowly ter rereading the letter from Nader 's associate . You 'd better be careful . He can be pretty nigh . " But the agent 's mood seemed to change he looked over the letter once again . " I 'll help ) 11 however I can , " he said finally . " Come back xt week and we 'll talk some more . " I worked with Cole for the next few months , ) ing over the ground he had already covered inhis investigation of the Calumet Township tax assessor , and then I went considerably further . What emerged was the story of the corruption of an entire city . In a sense , however , Oral Cole 's contest with Tom Fadell only prefigured my own . The nine-part series I wrote for the Gary Post-Tribune was never published . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices ; or perhaps it is decaying in the same Gary dump where Fadell had all the township 's tax-assessment records buried in 1967 . Taxing steel 9-1IIE PAPER THAT I came to work for in the I spring of 1970 , the Post-Tribune , is one of fourteen dailies in the Midwest and California owned by the Riddcr family . Through three generations this family has observed a set rule in expanding its empire : only buy papers in cities where there is no competition , and station a Ridder at every paper to watch over the investment . Walter Ricicler , publisher of the Post-Tribune , is of a different mold from the rest of his family : he is considered a liberal , and he is the only family member primarily interested in the news ; fur years , in fact , he wrote a political column from Washington . In 1966 , however , he quit the column to become publisher of the Post-Tribune . It was a curious decision . At fifty , Ridder was almost deaf and in poor health , and he insisted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is a man with a profound distaste for tension and controversy , and life in the company town that U.S. Steel built in 1906 had little else to offer him . In 1966 , the city was still controlled by Chacharis ' political machine . The following year the city 's population shifted to a black majority and elected Richard Hatcher , a thirty-six-yearold lawyer , the first black man to become mayor of a major American city . With Hatcher in office , Ridder appeared to be seized by the belief that a race riot was about to erupt . He arranged with Hatcher to have a " hot line " hooked up from the mayor 's office to Ridder 's apartment in the Hotel Gary . The publisher also ordered a moratorium on any news that was highly critical of the new black mayor , fearing it might increase racial tension in the city . But his editors ignored or underplayed the positive and often nationally interesting stories about the new mayor 's administration , and the tone of the paper 's reporting soon came to reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You ca n't help but be prejudiced , " Slaughter said the first day I arrived on the job . " The only whites Hatcher will talk to are subversives . " Hatcher responded by not granting interviews to Post-Tribune reporters . I had known Ridder in Washington , and when I finished college and the Marines I went to see him about a job with his Gary paper . He agreed , and in conversations with my wife Anne and me , he treated us like allies signing up to go into enemy territory with him . In Gary , he made sure I was given interesting assignments , and he backed me up on the controversial stories I wrote . One such story was on U.S. Steel 's gigantic Gary Works , which comprises half the taxable property in the city . The Post-Tribune article had suggested that the corporation might be trying to conceal the value of its plant , and there were reasons to suspect this was the case . During the 1960s alone , for example , more than a billion dollars in improvements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased by only $25 million , and by 1971 the mill 's tax assessment was only $173 million. * The story infuriated the superintendent of the Gary Works , J. David Karr , and he responded in a later interview with an apparent threat : " How far can you push me ? I 'm not asking for a fight with the paper , but a newspaper is a business . It does n't exist in a vacuum . It 's got to have a relationship with U.S. Steel . What would happen to it if it were to lose money ? You ever heard of that ? " By the time I arrived in Gary , Hatcher 's administration had brought a social revolution to the city . In fact it had become a kind of urban laboratory for virtually every major inner-city program available in the country ; more than $100 million had poured in from the federal government alone , and Hatcher had initiated an across-the-hoard reform of the city government . Still , Hatcher 's administration had failed to meet two major challenges : to neutralize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Steel 's taxable property . The consequences of these failings became apparent in late 1970 when Gary 's school superintendent called for an end to physical education and music classes and warned that there might not be enough money to keep the schools open throughout the year . It was the first of a succession of financial crises to hit the city 's bankrupt schools and government , both of which rely on property taxes for funding . The impasse seemed about to break in November 1970 , when Ralph Nader became interested in Gary . Nader was answering a call for help from a community organization set up by the late Saul Alinsky . Composed of white working people in Lake County , the Calumet Community Congress ( CCC ) attracted Nader 's attention because of its interest in challenging U.S. Steel 's tax assessment and pollution . At the CCC 's first meeting . 1,500 people- *Tax assessments in Indiana are set by state law at one third of true cash value . The full value of the plant , according to this formula , is then $519 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? listened to Nader 's associate , John Esposito , as he pledged to investigate U.S. Steel . They then voted to commit their new organization to fight political corruption and industrial abuses in the county . Unconsciously the organization of hardhats had declared war on all of Hatcher 's foes . . . and just on the eve of his reelection campaign . It ai n't beanbag 1.17HEN THE CITY DUMP started to burn out ol control in January 1971 , everyone knev , that the campaign had begun in earnest . ThE dump was located in the center of a residentia district . and arsonists set fire to it with per sistent regularity and considerable embarrass ment to Hatcher throughout the spring . Then were other signs of the beginning of the cam paign . A crime wave hit the city about the same time and ended , like the fires at the dump , 01 Election Day . Also in January , the township trustee , machine loyalist who administered emergenc : welfare grants , started to force poor relief ap plicants to sign cards pledging their support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a light-skinned Negro who was alsthe county coroner . Hatcher had told the Pos . Tribune 's City Hall reporter about the trustee ' actions and offered hint a pile of signed statE ments from welfare applicants as proof . Th reporter refused to take them . I did take then and my story forced the trustee to put an end t the pledge cards , but both he and Dr. William made charges on radio talk shows that I ha been biased because my wife worked at Cit Hall . A nne was indeed working there , but Rid &; had given his approval to her taking the job , an he said it would n't affect my assignments . H had a change of heart , however , when the co troversy arose . The next day , the Post-Tribune editor , in telling me that I could no longer wri. stories that dealt with the campaign , explaine . " The paper , like Caesar 's wife , must be heyor reproach . " I was disturbed because I knew there wou be other controversial stories emerging as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there would be anyone to write them . But had my hands full covering the CCC , and by the I had started to look into U.S. Steel 's tax asset ment . Nader 's property tax specialist , Sam Sim ? had contacted me about investigating the stE mill at the time the CCC was being organize He hoped I would do the research and feed it Nader for a possible law suit . In a fit of enthu asm for the cause , I was agreeable to this , a ! was puzzling over how to go about it when Hen Coleman , Hatcher 's campaign manager , called with a suggestion . Coleman has managed campaigns for black candidates in Gary since the 1930s ; first for and later against the machine . He is a short man in his late fifties with a soft , almost apologetic manner who carried a former Mafia muscleman about with him as a bodyguard . Coleman knew was trying to get a handle on the U.S. Steel story through Fadell , and he was eager to help me expose Hatcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here who just got fired by Fadell and he 's pretty mad , " Coleman told me on the phone . " Why do n't you come over and have a talk with him . ' ' The man in Coleman 's office , Wilbur Salib , had been an IRS auditor for nineteen years when he wrote an unfavorable evaluation of his supervisor and was promptly charged with violating IRS rules by preparing income tax returns for a fee . Fadell , who was then being investigated by the IRS , hired the jobless accountant , hoping he could learn IRS procedures from him . Although Sahib then served the assessor loyally for several years , Fadell had now fired him without notice . Salib said he could tell me a great deal about the inner workings of the assessor 's office and perhaps something about U.S. Steel too , but that he needed a job if he were going to talk . Coleman immediately hired him as a street inspector , and the new city worker spent all his off hours for the next few months helping me investigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices Salib told me about the first time we talked were trivial : employees receiving extra pay at the public 's expense so they could purchase tickets for fund-raising dinners , a " Flower Fund " into which the assessor 's employees kicked 2 per cent of their salaries for Fadell 's personal use , bloated mileage claims with percentage kickbacks to Fadell , and similar iliegali ties . Salib was sure there was far more to th ( story than this , however , and suggested we go ti the County Court House and look through th ( duplicate assessment records kept on file in tit ( auditor ' , office . When I read through the assessor 's payrol records for the past few years , I found tha Fadell 's average sixty-man payroll was laden with political appointees and personal retainers The most prominent of these was Oral Cole 's oh adversary and Fadell 's former protector , Georg ( Chacharis . In addition , twenty-four precinc committeemen or wives of committeemen , a min ister , several of Fadell 's relations , and two o Fadell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further review of the record from the preceding few years revealed remark able payroll increases during the weeks prior t elections when Fadell was running for office When he ran for mayor in 1963 , for instance . h , hired more than 1,000 temporary employees ; ii 1966 , when he was running for assessor , he hire ( more than 750 . Later I established that all thes , people hired to campaign for Fadell were pail with government funds . In 1966 alone , the cos of subsidizing the assessor 's campaign worker was $37,500 . From the payroll records . Salib and I wen into the vault where the assessment records ar kept . To our mutual surprise , we immediatel spotted another unmistakable pattern . The sessments of numerous corporations had bee mysteriously reduced in the years after Fade became assessor in 1958 . For example , vaIm tions of seven properties of the privately owne water company in Gary were reduced from $257,765 to $37,690 in one year . This meant reduction of about $31,000 in the company annual tax bill.Over a ten-year period this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hundreds of other corporations in th city were also receiving massive tax reductions . After leaving the County Court House the first day , I interviewed a number of the assessor 's Election Day employees and got them to sign statements saying they had received checks from the assessor 's office for political work . This evidence , along with the other payroll abuses and Salib 's testimony , was probably enough to send Fadell to jail if it could be presented in court outside Lake County . But then , learning of my investigation from an employee . Fadell counterattacked . Ile gave a statement to the city 's two radio stations : " The results of an investigation 1 have conducted prove conclusively that the Post-Tribune has in its employment a payola reporter , George Crile , who is actively working in the Hatcher campaign . Crile has been running around during working hours with City Hall employees attempting to concoct false rumors about me , the assessor , because I am for Dr. Williams in the mayor 's race . Crile 's wife works at City Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What other checks are the Criles receiving , " asked Fadell , " and what kind of merchants are the Criles anyway . . . " T WAS SHORTLY AFTER THIS that I met Oral I Cole through Salib , who had known him in the IRS . Following the agent 's leads , I started to visit the enemies Fadell had made during his career , as well as a number of his current employees , and businessmen throughout the city . What emerged was the apparent fact that Fade ! l was primarily a businessman , even though his varied and extensive ventures were hidden by secret trusts and other legal ruses . His confidential secretary had at one time been an officer in more than eight different corporations , most of which I believed served as conduits to channel money . Other employees and relatives also participated in the assessor 's complex deals . In more recent years , he had branched out into a variety of conventional businesses , which I listed along with his known holdings in the series of articles that I intended for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wrote , were " three trucking companies , including one with a $618,000 contract with the city of Chicago ? a trailer park ? a mobile homes sales company ? a law practice with some of the township 's large property owners as clients ? extensive real estate holdings in Lake and Porter counties , including two lakefront homes ? and a motel in Miami . Florida . " Working with Salib at the County Court House I learned to interpret different patterns in the assessment records . For instance , when a 2orporation 's assessment experienced a major and unexplained drop , it was safe to conclude . hat some form of business arrangement had In 1960 Robert Roy , then general manager of Gary Screw and Bolt Co. , was approached by Calumet Township Assessor Torn Fadell with the advice that it would be " wise " for Roy 's company to start selling some of its scrap metal below market price to a junk dealer friend of Fadell 's . In a recent interview , Roy recalled that Paden " indicated the company 's assessment need not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When Roy refused to accept the offer , Fadell raised Screw and Bolt 's personal property assessment over 400 per cent ? from $330,539 to $1,419,363 . At this point the corporation assigned several lawyers to the case and began the expensive process of appealing Fadell 's assessment . Although . the corporation succeeded in removing over $700,000 from . Fadell 's assessment , it still ended up with a $330,000 increase . " He 's a rotten type politician ; it 's amazing he 's still out of jail , " Roy commented . Tennis and other hazards F ORMER BOSS GEORGE CHACHARIS is , like me , a tennis enthusiast . I had approached him about a game shortly after arriving in Gary , and we used to play regularly . By the time the campaign was under way , however , other matters had become uppermost in my mind , and I had established a routine in which I would play with him at his private club in South Chicago and then drive over to visit with Orzd Cole , The contrast between the old political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was interesting , to say the least . Chacharis ' stock-in-trade was gifts and favors . I tried to avoid them , but he was insistent . First , there was the tennis racket I had left in his car overnight , which was returned restrung in pure gut . Then there was the $250 dinner party at Maxime 's in Chicago , and always the stories about Gary . We were friends in a strange way , but there was always a reserve between us , fur he knew I was investigating his protege , now employer , Tom Fadell . It unnerved me one afternoon , after Fadell had issued his " payola reporter " release , when the old boss started to call me " partner " throughout a doubles match . He had never done it before , and his smile was too broad and his manner too generous to make me comfortable : " Good shot , partner . . too bad , partner . we 'll get ' cm next time , partner . " I was thinking about Chacharis ' strange behavior as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to force my car off the Tri-State Highway . The cars behind were traveling at high speeds so there seemed to be no way to stop without having an accident . When the car , driven by a goateed young man wearing a T-shirt , started across my Volkswagen 's front fender , I turned onto the shoulder , slammed on the brakes , and watched as the Chevrolet fishtailed off the shoulder onto a grassy hill beside the highway . By the time the car caught up with me , I had managed to wedge my VW closely between two fast-moving cars , and after one more pass the driver dropped back and turned off at the next exit . I did n't know what to think of the incident until I talked to Cole that night at his house . " You better start changing your routes , " he advised . " That 's the way they do it , you know . " Later there was an anonymous note left during the night on my typewriter in the paper 's newsroom . It warned me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversations with Fadell 's deputy assessor , John Svaco . Whenever we met he spoke to me in peculiar riddles . " Hi , Crile , " he would say . " You better keep your tool cool , I 'm just watching out for your safety , you know . " Throughout the investigation , Henry Coleman expressed concern for my safety and frequently offered me one of his bodyguards . I half wanted to accept but never did . Deadlines and elections HAD IMPOSED A DEADLINE for finishing the I Fadell series in time for publication before the May 4 primary of 1971 . The articles were potentially important to the outcome of the election , for Fadell had become the central figure in a machine effort to steal the election from Hatcher . The assessor had announced that lie had conducted an investigation and found that City Hall officials had illegally registered 3,500 voters . The machine-controlled election board responded to these charges by instituting a challenge procedure that would have required at least thirty minutes for each of these voters to vote . The resulting bottlenecks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registered and where Hatcher 's voting strength was centered , would have effectively halted most voting by Hatcher 's supporters . The election board justified its challenge procedure solely on the basis of Fadell 's charges . The articles cast serious doubt on his credibility . They established that the assessor had used his office to solicit bribes , divert public monies for his political as well as personal uses , destroy hundreds of volumes of public records , and provide millions of dollars in tax reductions to certain corporations . In addition , they demonstrated that Fadell had manipulated the city 's budget process to bring about a financial crisis in the city administration just before the primary elections . When 1 turned the series over to Ridder two weeks before the election , there was no question in my mind that it would be published . Throughout the investigation Fadell had refused to answer questions or let me sec his assessment records , but there here duplicate records in the county auditor 's office and the paper could check them . Further , all of my interviews had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have Nader write an introduction to the series , " Let 's not have this be a Nader story , " Ridder said protectively . " Let 's have it be a Post . Tribune story . " I took this as a favorable sign and waited anxiously for a reaction . A week later Ridder said that the series wouk have to wait . He said he did n't want it to become an issue in the campaign . He had also decide ( not to endorse Hatcher , saying that no one ha ( proved to his satisfaction that Dr. Williams was the machine 's candidate . Elections in Gary are pitched baffles , employing guns and money , between those trying to steal the election and those trying to save it . This campaign had been enlivened more than usual by repeated bomb threats at City Hall , two fires in Hatcher 's car , and shots al his house . Nevertheless , despite the machine 's all-out effort and Fadell 's personal , rifle-waving intervention at one key polling place , Hatcher won the election by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complete my investigation of U.S. Steel 's tax assessment . I had left this out of the original series in order to get the articles published before the election . Now , however , I felt the series would be printed and I could go on to U.S. Steel . The investigation posed two major challenges : to finch out by just how much the plant was underassessed and to establish conclusively who was responsible for giving the tax break . The first breakthrough came with the discovery of a study made by an economist at a neighboring university . The study was n't aimed at the mill 's assessment , but it included a breakdown , to the dollar , of the cost of the improvements added to the Gary Works in the last ten years . Willi this figure , $1.289,320-890 , it was possible to determine that the steel mill was underassessed by more than $100 million , with a resulting annual tax break of about $16 million . This estimate was later confirmed by comparing it with the corporation 's own statement of the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Inchana 's Secretary of State . In that report . U.S. Steel claimed its Gary Works were worth , after depreciation , $793,991.461 . This . if correct , means it is receiving a $15 million-a-year tax break , which in turn means that tax hills for the average Gary homeowner have been a full 25 per cent higher than they should have been . Even more damaging to U.S. Steel 's claim that its assessment was " grossly excessive and illegal " were the assessments of the businesses in Gary that were not receiving tax breaks . " Compared to U.S. Steel we 're really hit hard , " Gunner Fog , superintendent of Union Carbide 's Gary plant , pointed out . Fog explained that his company 's $36 million plant had an annual tax bill close to $1 million . " It seems to me that if we pay $1 million , U.S. Steel ought to pay $100 million . They have billions of dollars invested there . " The second part of the investigation ? determining who was responsible for the tax break ? was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally attempted to raise U.S. Steel 's tax assessment . His modest increases were not backed up with adequate documentation , however , and the state tax board had always overturned them . Fadell thus claimed that he did n't have the power to raise the corporation 's tax assessment , eventhough he said lie believed it should be increased . It was a persuasive argument because the tax board traditionally tries to minimize the taxes of major industries in order to encourage investment in the state . I had just about accepted Fadell 's argument when I learned that William Sherry , the tax assessor of neighboring Portage Township . had successfully raised Midwest Steel 's tax assessment by 50 per cent . This showed that Fadell did indeed have the power to add millions of dollars in revenues to Gary 's nearly bankrupt schools and local government . All he had to do was follow Sherry 's example . My investigation was finished . The value of a newspaper O NE OF THE REPORTERS on the paper had warned me not to set my hOpes too high on getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained to him that the paper and Walter Ridder were two different things and that Ridder would print any legitimate story he knew about . " Before going any further , " my colleague suggested , " have a look at the paper 's assessment . " There are two kinds of assessments for corporations : real estate , which includes valuations for buildings and land , and business personal property , which includes the value of machinery and inventories . The paper 's real estate assessment was $42,000 for the land . The value placed by the assessor on the building ? a severalmillion-dollar , ten-year-old structure with more than seven miles of pipes and 770 tons of steel sections covering 103,870 square feet -- was $3,700 . Even the far smaller and obsolete Hammond Times building in the neighboring township had a $150,000 real estate assessment . With a little digging I found that the history of my paper 's assessment presented a disturbing implication . Under the previous owners and into the first years of the Ridders ' ownership , the building 's assessment was set at $500 and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1969 . In the late Sixties Fadell had visited the Post-Tribune to complain about a story about him : when he started to shout threats , the paper 's assistant publisher had thrown the assessor out . Infuriated , Fadell went back to his office and nearly doubled the paper 's personal property assessment . The paper had no grounds for objection because its assessment had been so low to begin with . In its report to the Indiana Secretary of State , the Post-Tribune set the value of its plant at $3,716,986 . Based on this figure , Fadell was still underassessing the paper by about $750,000 . When I had put the paper 's assessment history together , I wrote a memo to Ridder , thinking he would be equally surprised by my findings . I suggested that the assessment series should lead with the Post-Tribune 's admission of its own tax break , stemming as it did from the previous owners , followed by a demand that all properties in the city be reassessed . I concluded with a request : " I would like to keep this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it . Preferably not in your office . " Perhaps I should recall here that my relationship with Ridder was different from that of the paper 's other reporters . We had spent many evenings together discussing what could be done to improve the Post-Tribune , and he had taken an active interest in my career . In fact , in the late spring , he offered me a prized job as a Washington correspondent for the fourteen Ridder newspapers . 1 had accepted with the understanding that I would stay in Gary until the assessment series was printed . Perhaps this explains why I felt the paper 's strange assessment history offered an opportunity to get the story across more effectively . As I had told Sam Simon I would , in April I sent a copy of the series to Ralph Nader , but only after receiving assurances that the material would be kept in confidence . Larry Silverman , one of Nader 's young lawyers , flew to Gary to check on the facts and to arrange a law suit against Fadell . Silverman wanted to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in an un-Naderlike move he gave the CCC 's staff director a copy of the series without my knowledge . Before leaving Gary , Silverman successfully enlisted the aid of a public-interest firm in Chicago , Businessmen for the Public Interest , to prepare a law suit to challenge Fadell and to seek a reassessment of all properties in Gary . The initiation of the suit was to he announced after my articles were printed . At the same time , Senator Edmund Muskie 's subcommittee on Inter-Governmental Relations was preparing to hold public hearings throughout the country to explore abuses in the administration of local property taxes and the need fur reform . 1 sent them a copy of my series and arranged to have Hatcher send an open letter to Muskie with an appeal to hold hearings in Gary . Hatcher had been reluctant to get involved in the assessment controversy during the campaign . U.S. Steel was starting to cut back its work force and continually threatened to pack up its severalbillion-dollar plant and move elsewhere if its taxes continued to rise . Unrealistic as the threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the last time Hatcher had tried to challenge the mill 's assessment the paper had called it a " reckless " move . Ile was willing to send the letter but only after the series appeared in print . The coordinated attack on Fadell was readied . All that remained was for Ridder to give the go-ahead for the series to begin . But the publisher was spending less and less time in Gary , and on his infrequent trips he would say only that he was looking the series over . Finally , word came from Ridder that he wanted the series rewritten . The paper 's managing editor told me : " Walter wants to keep the story exclusively on the topic of assessments , " meaning no reference to any of the illegal activities Fadell was involved in . Also , I was told that the sections on the paper 's own assessment would have to go . I wrote Ridder complaining about his instructions , thinking they might have been misunderstood by the editor . His response to my protest was to ignore the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August , the city was filled with rumor ' about the stories . In the course of the investiga tion I had interviewed as many as 100 people and they were starting to ask if the paper was sup pressing my articles . When the CCC staff direr for who had been given the series by the Nadei lawyer began to tell people what was in ; t , I ha ( my first blowup with Ridder : in a " Dear George ' letter he angrily accused me of disloyalty fo having spread rumors that the Post-Tribune hat been making deals with Fadell , which , he said was not true . The letter took me by surprise , because it wa not like Ridder to take such a strong stand of anything and because his accusations were ur true . It was true that my investigation and th Nader leak of the series to the Alinsky peopl had stirred up the controversy . But it was almo four months since I had turned in the articleu and the controversy never would have started the paper had printed any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waited for response . He wanted to have dinner . We went to a quh Greek restaurant in Gary . He said it had all bee a misunderstanding . There had been a breal down in communications between the editor and myself . He wanted to get the articles pill lished even more than I did , and it would be dor right away . In turn , I said I was sorry for the embarrassment that the leakage of my stories had caused ' Udder as well as the Post-Tribune . A week later I left Gary for my new job as Washington correspondent for the Ridder papers . Then the long wait began ? September , October , November - with assurances from Ridder in Washington that the articles would be printed . One day he called me into his office and showed me a " rewritten version " of the articles and asked if I would be willing to have my by-line on it . " There are built-in inequities in Indiana 's tax system , aml there will be abuses until there is legislative reform . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax reductions , bribes , and buried public records . It was a whitewash , and l said my name could n't be used . The CCC had by then started a weekly newspaper , The Catalyst , and I called the editor , George Bogdanich , a former editor of the University of Wisconsin daily , and told him that I would let him use my research once his paper was incorporated but only if I became certain the Post-Tribune would not print the assessment articles . I went to the Washington bureau chief and . old him I was considering giving the articles to The Catalyst . Soon after this , Bidder asked me . o rewrite the story again . It was January of 1972 when he read the new version and said that he vas going to go to Gary to confer with his edi.ors once more about the series . It was always ince more with Ridder , but he was then recoverng from a pulmonary embolism and the stories were wearing him down . I believed him when he aid that a decision would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haul ? almost nine months Ince I had turned in the series ? but I now had mopes that it would at last be printed . That night , Ifter I talked to Ridder , the editor of The 3atalyst called to say that his paper had been ncorporated and asked if he could use the series . told him no , but that he should call hack the iext week after Ridder had returned from Gary rith his decision . Ridder arrived in Cary at the same time The ' , atulyst hit the street with its 500 copies carry-rig a headline story on the Post-Tribune 's sup ? ession of the assessment articles , complete with everat excerpts from my series , copies of which ad been turned over to the CCC by Nader 's twyer . Bogdanich. thinking the Post-Tribune as about to publish the articles , wanted to make : look as if The Catalyst had forced Ridder to ublish them . I was at work in Washington when the call ime from Ridder . " George , " he said , " there 's a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know . " A friend had called the night ... fore to warn me that Bogdanich had printedsomething about the series . I still did n't know what . " This is really bad , " Ridder said gravely . " There are things in here which could only have come from you . This is a serious breach of confidence . I 'm sorry but I think it would be best if you left the Washington bureau . I just no longer feel I can trust you . " I WAS FIRED . Then everything else started to crumble . A major scandal developed in the Chicago assessor 's office and the Businessmen for the Public Interest decided to drop the Gary case in favor of dealing with the problem in their own backyard . Muskie 's subcommittee had n't started its hearings and might not , and the Nader lawyers had moved on to uncover new injustices elsewhere . Then , too . the combined effects of the tax breaks and Fadell 's manipulation of the city 's tax rates had left the schools with only $23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School Superintendent McAndrew moved to stave off the inevitable announcement of bankruptcy by ordering the dismissal of more than 200 teachers and janitors and cuts in pay for everyone else . The confused and angry teachers voted to strike the next day . ' I1w cause of this fiscal crisis was simple , Fadell stated in a press release on the school crisis . It was brought about by the excessive spending and inept management of the school superintendent . The paper printed Fadell 's charges without comment . Later Ridder had the paper print the " rewritten " assessment story I had refused to have my name associated with , and then he resigned as publisher of the paper and left Gary for good . Former IRS agent Cole was nut surprised when I told him what had happened . He acted as if he 'd expected it all along . " Well , you remember I told you I did n't trust the Post-Tribune . " Switching subjects , he then told me what had happened to a woman he had been working with who had infiltrated a Mafia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cole informed of what she observed . " You remember Sally ? " he asked . " Yes , I remember her . Why ? " " She was just killed . It was a car accident . She was run off the road . " I said goodbye to Oral , but there was still one thing left that I had to do to satisfy my curiosity . I had to go back to Gary to the auditor 's office to look over the new assessments that had been made in the spring after I was fired . There were few surprises . There was the same token assessment for the Post-Tribune 's real estate ? but then I looked at the paper 's business property assessment . It had been $460,000 in 1970 , and now , in 1972 , it was $310,000.
