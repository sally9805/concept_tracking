In the early 1960s , when he was MGM Television 's Dr. Kildare , Richard Chamberlain got more fan mail than just about anyone on the lot since Clark Gable played Rhett Butler . In 1966 , when the TV series ended . Chamberlain decided to start his career all over again . <P> He went to England , let his peroxided hair grow brown and long . He took speech lessons , and , after a strong performance in a BBC drama , received an offer to play Hamlet with the excellent Birmingham Repertory Theater . Recalls Chamberlain : " I felt pride , amazement , disbelief , terror . " He was the first American to dare Hamlet in Britain since John Barrymore , and , premiere night , a full cry of London critics rode to Birmingham for the kill - and for a shock . Wrote the Times critic the next morning : " Anyone who comes to this production prepared to scoff at the sight of a popular American television actor playing Hamlet will be in for a deep disappointment . " <P> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall of Fame televises the Chamberlain Hamlet . It is an aristocratic , romantic and ( he admits ) " not scholarly " conception of the role . His Hamlet is passionate sometimes to the point of hysteria and Chamberlain 's accents ( well east of mid-Atlantic ) are tinged with tremolo . Sir Michael Redgrave , an esteemed former Old Vic Hamlet who plays Polonius in this TV production , says that , overall , " Richard is very good-more than just interesting . " To fit the two-hour time slot , however , more massive surgery has been performed on the Folio than any that Kildare ever did . <P> Chamberlain was not to the Shakespearean canon born . He grew up in Beverly Hills and , out of " sheer uncooperativeness , " did not learn to read until the fourth grade . He eventually managed a B.A. from Pomona College , and , after some acting lessons , landed an MGM contract . The studio gave him the Kildare part after passing over 35 others ( including Lew Ayres , who created the role in films ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of him , as Sir Cedric Hardwicke once told Chamberlain . " You 're doing it all backwards . You 're a star and you do n't know how to act . " <P> The change in direction was not easy . His Broadway bash , the musical version of Breakfast at Tiffany 's , closed before it opened . His films included one limited success as Julie Christie 's sadistic husband in Petulia . The change of image and luck finally came with Hamlet . " I had been told that the English actors would eat me alive , " he says , but he took strength from their patience and from the dictum of Margaret Leighton ( his TV Gertrude ) that rehearsals are the place to make a " bloody fool " of yourself . As he got deeper into the play , he discovered that " my own character was liberated , I was able to shout and cry-things I 'd always been too self-conscious to do before . "                 @ @ @ @
