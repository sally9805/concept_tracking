The President 's Real Estate <P> Sir / The number of White Houses ought to be reduced , not because they are so expensive and elaborate , but because they give us a nomadic President who migrates like a gypsy from Washington to Camp David to Key Biscayne to San Clemente and back again , absent too long and too often from the center of action in the nation 's capital Sept. 10 . Even if President Nixon had only wigwams at Key Biscayne and San Clemente , he would still be open to criticism on this score . <P> But as for how Mr. Nixon financed his purchases-TIME to the contrary notwithstanding-as long as nothing illegal was done , that is no more my business than it is Mr. Nixon 's business how I finance my home . <P> I only wish that I had a few of the friends he has . <P> <P> HUGO W. SCHROEDER SR . <P> <P> Randallstown , Md . <P> Sir / It seems very odd that while the President is running around seeking some magical vista , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his actions or inactions , he is compounding our problems by not facing his . <P> <P> DEWITT L. BROWN <P> Reno <P> Sir / When Bess Truman was living in the White House , she said , " It is an awful way to live . " Most of us " humans " can understand why a President and his family need to get away from the Executive Mansion , but it seems Hugh Sidey is so conceited he thinks he could spend four years there , under stress and strain , without ever having to get away . <P> <P> ( MRS . ) FLORENCE FOSHE <P> Des Moines <P> Sir / In the world of real estate lending and borrowing , he who borrows money is the mortgagor and he who lends money is the mortgagee . Therefore , the title of your article should have read " Richard Nixon , Mortgagor . " <P> <P> SUSAN C. WHITE <P> San Francisco <P> Sir / The " divine right " attitude of politicians at all levels has forced me to regard the form of government being practiced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet your publication , along with others , is certainly not providing us with a credible source of objectivity . <P> In your cover story on Henry Kissinger Sept. 3 , your use of the adjective " expensive " in describing the bulletproof windscreen at San Clemente is nothing more than a cheap shot at Mr. Nixon . <P> I did not know they made " cheap " bulletproof windscreens . <P> <P> THOMAS M. POLEN <P> University Heights , Ohio <P> The Unsurprising Poll <P> Sir / I am astonished that TIME is astonished by the fact that 45% of the people polled by Yankelovich thought President Nixon had prior knowledge of the Watergate break-in despite total lack of evidence of such prior knowledge Sept. 10 . The overwhelming preponderance of news-media treatment of the Watergate situation has been based on the assumption of wholesale guilt and massive cover-up by everyone involved . The press has performed nobly in its obligation to expose ; it has performed badly in its obligation to inform . <P> <P> JAMES G.
