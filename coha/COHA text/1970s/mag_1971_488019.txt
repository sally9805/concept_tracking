Mr. Gordon is co-author of " The Press and the Bay of Pigs , " reprinted in The Columbia University Forum Anthology ( Atheneum ) . Ruth Adler gives us a vivid running account of what some of the 6,000 employees of The New York Times did ' to put out the issue of February 28 , 1969 , The date was chosen arbitrarily , Miss Adler assures us ; and the account is based on memos prepared for her by the Times people involved . Some of the events described are something less than earthshaking , such as Arthur Ochs Sulzberger 'S entry for 9:36 A.M. to 9:37 A.M. : " Threw out a dead tulip . " Still , it is reassuring to know that the Times 's passionate concern for minute ' detail and absolute accuracy is shared at the very summit of the newspaper 's hierarchy . Miss Adler , who is editor of Times society . Talk , the publication for the newspaper 's staff , deals with all parts of the Times , including the thundering ' pressroom , where at peak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn out more than 1,000 complete papers every second . But , of course , it is the editorial side of a newspaper that monopolizes the drama and suspense , and Mtss Adler 's account of which Times reporters were doing what and where during her chosen twenty-four hours reflects a good deal of both , So , at four o'clock on a hot afternoon , Charles Mohr , chief correspondent for the Times in Southeast Asia , who has spent the previous night Chasing an artillery unit he had thought a likely target for attack , is hacking it down a rutted road toward Saigon . In hot and steamy Karachi , Joseph Lelyveld sits ' and waits in the luxurious residence of West Pakistan 's most colorful political figure , Zulfikar Ali Bhutto , President Ayub Khan 's most formidable political - opponent , In Nairobi , Kenya , where it has rained for three nights , Lawrence Fellows is haggling with an immigration officer . Meanwhile , Max Frankel , chief of the Washington bureau , and Robert B. Semple , Jr. , whose beat is the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Rome , soon to depart for Paris to cover President Nixon 's eight-day tour of five European capitals . In London it is damp and cold at 9 A.M. , and the bureau ? the largest of the Times 's foreign bureaus  --  is empty save for John Rothera , the early man in the wire room . But at 10:20 A.M. , according to Miss Adler , " Anthony Lewis emerges from his home in Islington . . . and steps into the waiting chauffeur-driven office Jaguar for the ten-minute drive " to the bureau in Printing House Square . For a Times man in London , nothing but the best . In West Berlin , at about the same hour , David Binder and Ralph Blumenthal are sleeping off the exhaustion of two days of Nixon coverage . In the Paris bureau , in anticipation of the Nixon visit , Henry Tanner shows up for work at the unusually early hour of 10 A.M. , and two chauffeurs  --  one the regular , bureau driver and a second one hired to drive Messrs . Frankel and Semple around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are n't there any taxis in Paris9 ) In Jerusalem , at 11 that morning , portant story  --  the state funeral of Premier Levi Eshkol . ' And so the tentacles of the Times reach out  --  to Dana Adams Schmidt in Beirut , Robert Doty in Rome , Tad Szulc in Bucharest , Drew Middleton in Brussels . And to Lawrence Davies in San Francisco , who reports that prospects for news at 9 A.M. are not bright for that day on his beat , which extends north to Alaska and west to Hawaii . And 400 miles to the south , in Los Angeles , Douglas Robinson and Lacey Fosburgh meet for breakfast and bemoan the- fact that y every day it becomes more difficult to pick a good lead from the verbal outpourings of the witnesses at the Sirhan trial . Just about the time Mr. Lewis is pre-paring to enter his , chauffeur-driven Jaguar in London , it is late at night in New York City , and Clive Barnes , the drama critic , is drinking black coffee in the kitchen of his Manhattan apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far way the Times 's art critic , John Canaday , a victim of insomnia , worries about what he has written for the morrow 's paper on the artist Grandma Moses . And in the newsroom of the Times , at 3:01 A.M. , Tom Daffron , assistant news editor , says goodnight to the dozen editors , rewrite men , clerks and copy boys who have closed the final edition . The newsroom , with its row upon row of gray , metal-topped desks , subsides into silence , while down below the pressroom roars into a crescendo . Now this is a highly readable way to tell the story of a great newspaper . It is solidly rooted in the romantic tradition , guaranteed to make high school editors and college majors in English yearn for the aroma of printer 's ink . But what is highly readable about a subject such as this is not always highly relevant , and there are many aspects of the Times story about which Miss Adler is either entirely silent or much too casual . The Times is more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mills , book publishing operations and radio stations , in addition to other newspapers and magazines . ( Last October , the Times acquired properties from the Cowles communications empire for which it paid 2.6 , million shares of Times Class A common stock , worth at the time more than $50 million . ) It is quite possible that on February 28 , 1969 , a decision was made at some level of the Times corporate structure that was of more lasting significance than any decision made on the editorial side . Miss Adler can defend her silence on such matters by urging that she was not writing a corporate history . Granted ; nevertheless , her day in the life of the Times turns out to be only part of the day , and not necessarily the most important part . Miss Adler thinks well of the Times , and with good reason . Nevertheless , it must be admitted that her blind choice of February 28 , 1969 , was a lucky one for her . At least she was lucky that she did n't pick , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hierarchy of the Times ordered a playdown of Tad Szulc 's story out of Miami warning of an imminent U.S.-sponsored invasion at the Bay of Pigs . To paraphrase Alexis de Tocqueville : All those who seek to destroy the liberties of a democratic nation ought to know that turning the newspapers into mouthpieces of the ' government is the surest and the shortest means of accomplishing it . Such an attempt was made in the Bay of Pigs episode . Another similar case was the Pentagon Papers , but it failed in that instance . The Times is a great institution , and as such is often exposed to great pressures  --  from government , from advertisers , from personality clashes within the institution itself . Recent books by Gay Talese and James Aronson offer eloquent testimony to that effect . One notes the relevancy of an article by Stanford N , Sesser in the Spring 1970 issue of the Colunibia Journalism Review , on the intimate relationship between the Times 's travel section and travel advertising . " Until this year 1970 , " Mr. Sesser writes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right next to the Florida hotel ads. " - The Times prides itself , of course , on the absolute independence of its editorial policy from advertising pressures . I had an interesting and illuminating experience with the Times that had a direct bearing on this matter . Back in the days of the McCarthy witch hunt , I tried to place an ad with the newspaper for a book by Dan Gillmor , a crusading reporter who had been trained by the great 0 . K. Bovard of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch . The Times 's Advertising Acceptability Committee turned down the ad , obviously because it thought the book too radical . I appealed to John B. Oakes , nephew of Adolph S. Ochs , and a member of the paper 's staff of editorial writers . I told him the ad had been rejected without any explanation . He promised to look into the matter . Two days later he told me on the phone : " You 're right ; the Advertising Acceptability Committee voted the ad down , and there 's no way the decision can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can stop me from reviewing the book  --  and I will review it . " He did , too .
