AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES in recent years have gradually become more and more like big businesses and the students in them like units to be fitted into the evolving corporation-dominated civilization . This transformation , which might be compared to a butterfly changing back into a grub , appears to have been taking place within the rapidly forming state university supersystems all across the country ? California , Texas , Wisconsin , Illinois , Missouri . Optimistic observers welcome the change as fine a good and necessary extension of Amer-ican values and the American way . Those of us who do not agree see the universities ceasing to be free and stimulating places of learning conducted for the students ' culture and development and becoming instead new adjuncts of the corporate and governmental bureaucracies . The optimists set forth their views in any number of budget reports , in reports to trustees , in books written by administrators of what has been admiringly called " the multiversity . " Clark Kerr 's book The Uses of the University , written when he was president of the University of California , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defines and accepts the university as the new facility for servicing the needs of government and business . The other side of the argument is also set forth in numerous books and reports , but seldom as succinctly as by Harold L. Enarson , the president of Ohio State University . En-arson describes the changes as " the triumph of technique over purpose , " caused by a failure " to grasp the essential nature of the university .. . independent , freestanding , openly critical of the conventional wisdom , friendly to disputation , enchanted with controversy , hospitable to those who ' think otherwise . ' " The metaphor that " the university is a business " should not amuse us or strike us as merely perceptive ; it should appall us . As universities organize themselves into single supersystems nurtured and regulated from central administrative stems , they become more and more subject to governors and legislatures that can deal far more effectively with such Central stems than with the older pattern of scattered and independent campuses . As the states become dependent on corporate power and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education becomes dependent on corporate power . Thorstein Veblen 's prophecy of fifty years ago becomes the reality to which the present generation of students falls victim , Veblen warned that " those principles and standards of organization , control , and achievement , that have been accepted as an habitual matter of course in the conduct of business , will , by force of habit , in good part reassert themselves as indispensable and conclusive in the affairs of learning . " In every significant way except net profits ? and arguably in that way , too , in some senses ? the universities , supposedly dedicated to diverse and unprofitable speculation , become business places operated by business people for business reasons . Over the past ten years Veblen 's prophecy has been made manifest , as can be demonstrated by a brief recounting of some of the events at the University of Texas . Politicians and businessmen took over the University of Texas at Austin and centralized and politicized the UT system . Since events in Texas , like events in California , seem to foretell what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Texas gives us a prevision of what might befall public higher education elsewhere in America . 2 S LONG AGO AS 1940 , the Texas regents started a movement to eliminate radical teachers . They met in closed session with the then president , a mild-mannered liberal named Homer P. Rainey , and one of them handed Rainey a card on which had been written the names of four economics professors , none of whom had been on the faculty for less than fifteen years . " We want you to fire these men , " the regents said . Rainey would n't do it , and in the course of time the regents fired Rainey . The regents were supported in their politics by W. Lee ( " Pass the Biscuits , Pappy " ) O'IJaniel , the governor of the state at the time . O'Daniel in turn was supported by Harry Weiss , the president of Humble Oil , who had very specific ideas about the uses of a university . Soon after Rainey had been appointed president Weiss offered him and the university precise advice : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural resources industry , and avoid encouraging aspirations that might lead to " dissatisfaction and unrest . " Three decades later the governor 's mansion was occupied by John Connally . Although dissimilar in many other ways ( O'Daniel a rough , country-talking flour salesman and Connally an urbane lawyer ) , both men clearly believed in the precepts of their patrons . Connally studied politics under the tutelage of Lyndon Johnson , and he studied wealth as a lawyer and lobbyist for Sid Richardson , the multimillionaire oilman . When , after brief service as President Kennedy 's Secretary of the Navy , Connally became the governor of Texas , it quickly became apparent that both he and Pappy O'Daniel , personally as different as caviar and biscuits , had similar ideas about the purposes of higher education . O'Daniel had been an eager and obvious agent of the emergent oil , industrial , and financial aristocracy in trying to turn the state universities into corporate personnel training cenConnally believed , as he said in a letter in 1967 , that public higher education and state government " are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of prosperity connoted a booming economy dependent upon large corporations operating among a contented people in a stable social order . He boasted of the many junior colleges that had been established and of the threefold increase in vocational and technical courses . He had no personal interest in , or association with , workers and the poor : he hobnobbed with the rich and the corporate elite , and from these , his friends , he chose most of the members for the university boards . He led the legislature into substantial increases in the funding of higher education , but the works he had in mind for the colleges and universities were the works of industry and commerce . When Connally ran for governor , an Austin business lawyer named Frank Erwin joined his inner circle . Elected in 1962 , Connally made Erwin a UT regent and , successively , the state 's Democratic chairman and the Democratic national committeeman from Texas . A gruff , candid politician and a brutal user of power , Erwin also was a close friend to Lyndon Johnson , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperious chairman of the regents , a bull in the parlors of the academy charging everything that looked pink to him . Despite the criticism , Connally reappointed him and thereby became politically responsible for what happened to UT during the period . What looked like paltry politics was much more than that , because , as Veblen had told us , and as none of us now has a good excuse for not knowing , domination of universities by politicians and businessmen comes down to domination by businessmen . Connally 's policies favored this domination from 1963 to 1973 . Whenever possible he appointed right-thinking businessmen to the board of regents , and the university often staged political entertainments for state officeholders with allied interests . All the beneficiaries were conservative Democrats . The regents obliged a young socialist philosophy teacher , Larry Caroline , to leave the faculty , and they instituted , against students and faculty alike , a campaign of severe repression ? prohibited meetings , encouraged police crackdowns on campus , restricted distribution of an off-campus newspaper . They fired a reformist dean suspected of undue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of Boston University ? and in effect they forced the resignation of Norman Hackerman , a president of UT given to the expression of unpredictable opinions . When Hackerman subsequently became president of Rice University , he explained that university regents and trustees were playing larger and larger parts in the hiring , promotion , and firing of professors , which , he said , meant that " political points of view come into the picture . " Political spoils 1 OLITICS ALSO BEGAN to intrude upon the university 's method of hiring architects . Before the advent of Connally and Erwin , the university comptroller , an old-fashioned and moralistic fellow named Charles Sparenburg , had worked out a system of awarding contracts that did not depend upon the architect 's allegiance to a political party . Sparenburg had run the university 's business for thirty-one years , and he often identified himself as " a hard-core conservative , " but he was not a careful man . He disliked and distrusted Lyndon Johnson , and occasionally of an afternoon he could be found in a local beer garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson , Connally , Erwin , and those whom he described as  - -  the stooges in the chancellor 's office . " To a bureaucrat with politics in view , however , architects ' contracts are a honeypot without a lid . There is no way you can select an architect by competitive bidding . Among architects as among artists , how can you argue that the cheapest one is the best ? Furthermore , architects are often organized into lucrative firms , and they can be expected to make substantial campaign contributions . Connally and Erwin blundered into the more embarrassing aspects of this situation when , in the spring of 1964 , the regents awarded a 890,000 contract to an El Paso architectural firm headed by Rea Nesmith , a prominent Republican . Two of the regents ( one of them Frank Erwin ) remained opposed to the contract , and Erwin called Connally 's political coordinator in El Paso and they agreed Nesmith would not do . Within a matter of a few days Nesmith was advised not to begin work . The arbitrariness of this procedure offended another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of John Redditt , who had served in the Texas senate for many years and knew what was what , and Redditt began to make trouble . Erwin sent Redditt a newspaper clipping that had been mailed to the governor 's office " by one of the governor 's coordinators in El Pasc County . " Erwin also informed him that " other information " had been sent to Connally " from his friends and supporters in El Paso County . ' In a second letter , Erwin , thinking he wa : writing entirely protected from the vulgar curi osities of the population , told his colleague ca the board : " Right or wrong , it is Connally 's view tha since architectural contracts are not let on competitive bid basis , they simply constitut. valuable gifts that are awarded by the stat government . It is also his view that ... whit he would be opposed to awarding contracts t incompetent architects , he is also opposed t awarding contracts to competent architect who have not been friendly to him and his Ac ministration . By a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ th state architectural contracts awarded to comp tent architects who have been friendly to and his Administration .... ? ... I am aware of the governor 's attitude i this matter .... " Erwin was one of Connally 's two or three to political operators . The regent 's letter to Re , ditt therefore recorded an official policy of p litical spoils as officially as officials are likely record one . Redditt would have none of it . The regen met for a showdown in the presence of Spare burg and Chancellor Harry Ransom . The issue was raw ? would the university knuckle under to political power ? ? and the arguing was raw , too . Ransom sat silent as Redditt , A. G. Mc-J ' powerful Houston banker ) , and Rabbi Levi Olan of Dallas said Connally 's veto-byinaction of the Nesmith contract was an unconstitutional invasion of the regents ' authority . Erwin argued that Connally did n't have to hand out patronage like this to his political enemies . They would choose architects who had contributed to the right campaigns , he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canceled the contract . This was the last close important vote on the board of regents in the 1960s . The time was October 1964 . Johnson was in the White House , Connally was in the mansion , and Erwin was in the regents ' room . They had the power , and they had already indicated what they were going to do with it . Redditt resigned , charging that Governor Connally was dictating to the regents , that the board had accepted the dictation , and there was more of the same to come . McNeese said publicly that the four prevailing regents had acted " from ruthless error or lack of courage . " Rabbi Olan said the decision " could threaten the academic integrity of the school . " Connally denied attempting to dictate to Redditt or any regent with respect to a matter affecting the univer- ; ity , " but he added that Redditt 's objections were " untrue . " ' Redditt , thus provoked , violated ) ne of the rules that usually constrain gentlenen ? he gave the press Erwin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor Connally " approved the inclusion " of a special provision ( called " a rider " ) n the state general appropriations bill which . aid that no funds spent by the act could go for Lrchitects ' fees " without the advance written . pproval of the governor . " This meant no archiect could get state work unless Connally gave lie go-ahead . In the glare of the revelation that Erwin had aid Connally regarded the state 's discretionary ontracts as valuable gifts for friends , Erwin ecame arch . " Any public official in his right aind would have that view , " he said , " and no ne else in his right mind would criticize him n. it . " The banker , the senator , and the rabbi ad no sooner been thus assigned to the nutouse than Connally told the regents he did not gard the contracts as valuable gifts . Nesmith said later , " I saw Governor Con-ally at a reception in El Paso before a cham ? a ' of commerce meeting . I introduced myself , Lying , Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least ought to know me in person hen you see me , ' to which he replied , ' Texas a one-party state , and I 'll see to it that it ays that way . ' " But for all that , the business-oriented politicians had won . Before another ten years passed , Connally , the champion of a one-party . Texas , would be campaigning for an administration bent on making toe United States a one-party country ? although of the other party . The next step in converting UT into a part of a political and business spoils system was to get rid of Sparenburg . During a fancy dinner party at Erwin 's home , Sparenburg was informed that the nomination of architects and the supervision of construction would he turned over to a new vice-chancellor . ( This turned out to be E. Don Walker , who by 1973 was the number-two man in the entire UT system , supervising all of its business operations . ) The Johnsons ' favorite Texas architects , Max Brooks and Associates , became favorites of the university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firms that were considered the best lost out in a situation regarded suspiciously in some informed quarters . A firm that had worked on many UT jobs , but whose members had not contributed to Connally 's campaign , was disapproved for a UT project , and one of the architects in it was represented as having said , " Believe you me , we 'll know better next time . " By 1972 , the Max Brooks firm 's UT projects included a medical school at Houston , a dorm-classroom building , a new east mall and fountains , the Johnson Library , a new physics-math-astronomy building , and conversion of a building into headquarters for the UT system . Sparenburg went on handling the university 's bank deposits , but not for long . It is understood that there had been polite pressure to put some of UT 's balances in a new Austin bank in which a Johnson associate was a moving force , but that Sparenburg did not do it , whereupon the regents did . ( On the other hand , a system of competitive-interest bids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' approved list for receiving deposits , and by 1973 a commendably high percentage of the funds had been concentrated in interest-paying accounts . ) Redditt had quit , and Connally did not reappoint either of the other two regents who had voted against the Nesmith cancellation . W. W. Heath , an Austin lawyer and banker , had voted in the majority of four , and he was reappointed and became chairman . After Heath had facilitated the university 's financing of the Johnson Library , that library 's placement on the UT campus , and the establishment of the Johnson School of Public Affairs , President Johnson made him Ambassador to Sweden . Since Erwin was at that point the regents ' vice-chairman , in effect Johnson was also choosing Erwin to succeed Heath as chairman . With Connally 's reappointment of Erwin in 1968 for six more years , the Connally-Johnson group continued its control of the state 's higher education business for several more years . V HERE IS AN ORGANIC tendency for a univer- sity to behave like a business , because its endowment , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of fiscal 1972 , the UT permanent fund held $207 million worth of the bonds of privately owned utilities and $30 million worth of their common stocks , along with common stocks in oil and gas worth $38 million ; chemicals , drugs , and cosmetics , $36 million ; food and soap , $21 million ; banks , $16 million ; electrical and electronics companies , $15 million ; and auto companies , $12 million , Altogether , the UT fund , which totals two-thirds of a billion dollars , earned that year $25 million in oil and gas royalties and bonuses , and $11 million in stock dividends . Universities ' investments make them factors in the financial markets and implicate them in the ethical consequences of corporations ' behavior . The regents and administrators , heavily drawn from business and the noneducational professions , and doing business for the university with other businessmen , also decide the allocation of the university 's resources among departments and kinds of activities . These factors , together with pressure from the corporations , turn the university toward the hired-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Coordinating Board of the Texas University and College System said in a report that " higher education is the largest industry , private or public , in Texas today . " One salient aspect of business missing from this discussion has been that of the net money profit , but the new public university can be used to profit businessmen who give campaign money to benefit politicians who in turn put their friends in charge of the university . The multiversity may then become , to a perceivable but not measurable extent , the poliversity , a staging area for the celebration of the politicians , and a government agency pumping out beneficial contracts for their business supporters . In these ways , involving money and status , the exploited university provides an acceptable rate of return on capital investment . Like other multicampus public systems , the UT system has been consolidated by the Connally regents into one administrative stem through which the several divisions of the university , reconceived as " units of the system , " are standardized and subordinated . The regents and their top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hackerman , from his redoubt at Rice , makes the important point that this is not a question of pressure being applied by individuals or political groups ? the organization , the centralization itself , changes the nature of higher education . The politicians concentrate the universities ' money , and the businessmen , attracted by the presence of the money , get into the universities ' affairs . If bank deposits and architectural contracts provide opportunities for indirect subsidies of business allies , so also do land and construction deals . Texas law requires that , in the UT system , construction contracts ( in contrast to architects ' contracts ) have to be let to low bidders on the basis of sealed competitive bids . There is some leeway for politics ? the job specifications , the designation of materials to be used , the regents ' decisions on what " additive alternatives " they want to include in arriving at low bids , and whether to permit cost overruns . Nevertheless , low bidding is the general rule . But there can be no competitive bidding in buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager to attract a new university to their land that they will gladly give the site required . Even if the site is bought , there are many variable , subjective considerations . The money in question reaches such large amounts that the temptation to become unduly subjective often places great stress on standards of the public interest . John Peace , a lawyer and politician , who succeeded Frank Erwin as chairman of the board of regents , estimated in 1973 that the UT system construction in the works was costing more than $500 million . During their meetings the regents sometimes seemed to want more students so they could build more buildings . Given the proven record of the regents in the matter of architects ' contracts , it is not surprising that a number of questions have been raised about their dealings in land , particularly in regard to the land chosen for the new university complex at San Antonio . Much of the evidence is circumstantial , but the connections between the people involved in the decision tend to support the burden of this essay ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail . An interesting land deal FEW PEOPLE had argued that the new uni- versity in San Antonio should he independent of the UT system , but Peace insisted it be " structured under " the core system . Peace -i from San Antonio , and Erwin said the regent : would follow Peace 's guidance on the selection of the land site . There was a killing to bc made . as everyone knew , for as Peace publicl1 explained , " The rule of thumb is that for eacl student you generate a community of four peo ple . " There would be homes and apartmen houses to provide , parking lots , commercia businesses , shopping centers ? the whole thins for a population of 30,000 students and , there fore , about 120,000 people in all . Whoeve owned the land around the new campus coul get rich , and the UT regents had to decid which of about ten free sites to accept . Two months before the regents announced the site , Charles Kuper and Alfred Negley , acting as individuals , bought options on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northwest of the city . Kuper joined a group offering the regents 600 acres of the property free for the new university . It was this property that the regents , on Peace 's motion , chose . As governor , Connally had appointed all nine of the regents . He had also appointed Kuper 's father-in-law to the State Parks and Wildlife Commission and Negley to the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission . Negley 's wife is the daughter of George Brown , the top official of Brown &; Root , the worldwide construction firm that financed Lyndon Johnson 's rise and subsequently has been close to Connally , too . In September 1971 , a Nader-type research group of UT law students revealed that when Connally had retired for a year to private life in 1969 , taking up the practice of law with Vinson , Elkins , Searls , and Connally in Houston , he also went into business with Kuper and Negley . Regent Peace had acted as an incorporator and initial director for their company , La Ventura Corporation , which was authorized to buy and sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( president ) , Connally vice-president ) , and Negley ( secretary ) . A little later that year another Ventura company , the Ventura Development Corporation , was formed with the same three officers . Its stated corporate purposes were to own and operate food-service establishments , hotels , and theaters , and to deal in and franchise such places . V HE STUDENTS SAID that Peace , in setting up La Ventura and making the motion to accept the Delavan property that enriched Kuper and Negley , had violated the state 's code of ethics law and should resign or be removed from office . According to Bexar County officials consulted by the law students , the regents ' decision had increased the value of the 1,100 acres Connally 's and Peace 's associates were buying from the $2 million they were paying for it to between $5.5 million and $20 million . Looking back on the charges , Peace says , " That was an insult to my intelligence more than it was to my morals . " Answering the students at the time , he denied any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendation to the UT staff and he had had no knowledge of the option-buying until after the board 's decision . His law partner , not he , had drawn up the papers for La Ventura , and he himself " had nothing to do " with that , held none of the stock , and took no part in the business . He admitted that Kuper and Negley were friends of his , but said he had " no close business associates who owned any land out there . " Connally , who had been Nixon 's Secretary of the Treasury for about eight months at the time of the students ' charges , was not heard from on the subject , but Peace and Herbert Kelleher , an attorney for La Ventura , said they understood Connally had quit the companies sometime late in 1970 , probably before he joined the Cabinet . Kelleher says that the companies were organized to do a restaurant business , but the business was not a success , the firms did no other business , and they were defunct after about a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Houston now make it clear , however , that other companies in which Connally is a director will profit substantially from the development around the school . Kuper includes in his development plans for 2,000 acres around the San Antonio campus a 1,144-acre tract that one of his planning papers says is " controlled " by Gibraltar Savings Association of Houston . Connally is an in-and-out director of Gibraltar , the largest savings association in Houston , with eight branches and first-mortgage loans totaling about $400 million . An officer of Gibraltar organized Houston Imperial Corporation , evidently a subsidiary of Gibraltar , and in 1971 Houston Imperial bought the 1,144-acre tract and sold it to Gibraltar . In June 1973 , state records showed that Connally was also a director of Houston Imperial Corporation . The officer in question says that he , not Connally , brought Gibraltar into the matter . First City National Bank of Houston has been involved in the land activity around the site as coexecutor for an estate that owns some of the land . First City National , with resources over $2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' bank , " the late Judge James Elkins having been its " senior chairman of the board " as well as the original " Elkins " in the law firm in which Connally is now a partner . Connally has been a listed director of the bank for the past several years . When he announced his switch to the Republican party , he did so in the bank 's Houston building , in which the Elkins law firm is located . Land records show that First City National , as coexecutor for the estate holding land in the UTSA area , released Charles Kuper from a half-million-dollar note on the estate 's land five months after the site announcement . Kelleher also confirms that Gibraltar and Houston Imperial ? in both of which Connally is an in-and-out director ? have been financing Kuper 's development of land around UTSA . Kuper and Negley refused to be interviewed about any part of this subject on the grounds that it 's a personal matter , and Connally did not reply to questions about it put to him in a registered letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two companies and the Kuper-Negley interests . In 1970 Connally was a director of Halliburton Company , the corporate owner of Brown &; Root , of which George Brown was chairman and Herbert Frensley was president . Connally and Frensley were two of Gibraltar 's eleven directors . Thus , in the year when Kuper and Negley were buying options around the future UTSA site two months before Connally 's nine regents announced where it would be , Connally was ( 1 ) in business with both of them through the Ventura companies ; ( 2 ) a director of the corporate owner of the construction mammoth whose chairman was Negley 's father-in-law ; ( 3 ) a co director , with that same construction firm 's president , of the savings association that would soon appear as a financier of the development of Kuper-Negley acquisitions and as a property controller in the UTSA area in its own name ; and ( 4 ) tied closely to the Elkins bank that was a trustee of other land in the UTSA area . N THE UNIVERSITY perceived and used as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as corporation-type executives who should be very handsomely rewarded . Early in 1969 , the regents rejected all bids for the remodeling of a house given them by a regent named Bauer and hired a man in construction work to build a new chancellor 's residence at a " salary " listed as " cost plus a fixed fee . " By this strange arrangement they may have hoped to justify the failure to take competitive bids on the job . A limit of $163,000 was placed on the cost of construction . Asked about an astonishing report that the 3roject , including all costs , was running up to li750,000 , Deputy Chancellor Walker replied that : he estimated but not final cost was $200,000 , tnd " the suggestion of $750,000 is ridiculously sigh . " It certainly was , but within months , Erwin admitted the cost was $907,700.23 , a Figure that grew to over $1 million when cerain additional costs were included . Politicians , ! ontractors , architects ? they had all worked to- ; ether to produce one of the Texas regents ' nost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Three stories high and shining white , with . olurnns to its full height across the front , the : hancellor 's house looks like a palace . It has ight bathrooms and four half-baths , more than dozen telephones , three marble-faced fire-daces , antique furniture , room-size rugs in mutd golds , crystal chandeliers , two dining rooms , and a walnut-paneled library with padded-leather ofas . The kitchen has an ice machine , two sinks , wo dishwashers , two stoves and a double oven , aore than fifty cabinets , a washer and dryer nd a commercial-size refrigerator with glass loors . The guest house has two bedrooms and wo baths ; the bathhouse by the swimming poolhas kitchen equipment and a bathroom . There is an air-conditioned greenhouse . The four-car garage is opened and shut by remote controls . Erwin 's defense was that this place is actually a university building in which the chancellor entertains large university gatherings , and of course that does happen there , but a million dollars for a university administrator 's house ? Nobody could defend it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of an improving situation at the University of Texas in the past couple of years . McNeese , Sparenburg 's supporter , is back as a regent and has been elected chairman . which bodes well for a cessation of rank political favoritism . Ed Clark , another new regent , has been calling for more openness with the public about university business . President Stephen Spurr said last spring that he had encountered no attempts at political interference from the regents in academic matters . But the basic system that the Connally regents consolidated continues ? half a billion dollars ' worth of construction run by a central administration ruling over a statewide empire of educational institutions . As he appointed the three new regents who took office in 1973 , Governor Preston Smith called the posts " real plums , " and some of the regents ' recent concerns show why . Last year they sold 52,000 acres of land in three Florida counties to a development company for $15.5 million without advertising for bids . Bob Long , the university 's lawyer in such matters , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land development company in the United States , " but they decided not to ask for bids because they wanted payment over a term to retire some construction bonds with the money , and they did n't want to be offered " funny-money deals . " Early this year UT , again without advertising for bids , sold about 7,500 acres of land alittle north of Houston for $13 million to a ri341ionaire oilman who is developing a new town near the UT land . University officials said the potential buyers had to be " pre-qualified " as financially responsible people who could provide " a reliable cash flow " to retire the university 's construction bonds . Looking through the locked metal gate of the million-dollar mansion for the chancellor of a public university that was once governed unpretentiously by the members of its faculty , you see the story .
