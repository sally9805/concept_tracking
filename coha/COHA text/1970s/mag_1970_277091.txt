In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him . <P> - Sixth Amendment <P> But what if the accused turns his own trial into a soapbox , a shouting match or a near riot ? If the judge ejects him , can he still be tried and convicted in absentia ? With a stern yes , the Supreme Court last week upheld the power of trial judges to control unruly defendants by citing them for contempt , removing them from the courtroom or shackling and gagging them . The decision was an obvious response to the growing phenomenon of obstreperous defendants who mock all accepted rules for trial decorum . Wrote Justice Hugo Black : " Our courts , palladiums of liberty as they are , can not be treated disrespectfully with impunity . " <P> Constitutional Waiver . Although the decision dealt with conduct at a Chicago trial 13 years ago , the court clearly was also mindful of recent disruptions in another Chicago courtroom-Judge Julius Hoffman 's . The decision appeared to vindicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the binding and gagging of Black Panther Bobby Scale . <P> Two other beleaguered trial judges also had reason to be pleased with the decision . New York Supreme Court Justice John M. Murtagh in February had abruptly recessed a pretrial hearing for 13 boisterous Panthers accused of plotting to bomb public places in New York City . This week , armed with solid support for strict discipline plus notification from the defendants that they were ready to stand trial , Murtagh will resume their case . Just one day after the Supreme Court ruling , Philadelphia 's Court of Common Pleas Judge Leo Weinrott was confronted with Defendant George Kenney , who kept yelling at potential jurors and told the judge to " go to hell " during the early stages of his trial for killing a liquor-store clerk during a holdup . After giving several warnings , Weinrott successfully silenced Kenney by ordering his mouth bandaged . <P> The Supreme Court 's decision was instigated by William Allen , an obscure Chicagoan who was charged in 1956 with taking $200 from a bartender at gunpoint . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to be a corpse , " and flung his court-appointed lawyer 's files to the floor . After unheeded warnings , the judge expelled Allen from the courtroom . Allen was convicted of armed robbery , but later petitioned the federal district court from jail for relief on the grounds that he had been denied his right to confront his accusers . In last week 's decision on Allen , the Supreme Court promulgated a new rule : a defendant who makes the progress of his trial impossible has effectively waived his constitutional right to confrontation , and can reclaim it only when he is willing to behave in the courtroom .
