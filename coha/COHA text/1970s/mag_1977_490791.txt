THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment AFRIEND writes : During the worst of the recent freeze , I stayed indoors most of the time . The building I live in is an old , large one on Riverside Drive . At the beginning of the freeze , a couple of pipes burst and we were without water for nearly three days . However , after that the water , cool and hot , was there , and , as the apartment walls are old and thick , they kept us warm , though there was less heat than usual . One morning , when I woke up it was zero degrees and the bedroom window was completely coated with frost on the inside  --  a fine white powder that I had to scratch with my fingernail to see through . The street outside seemed coated with powder , too : sand and rock salt that had been spread during the night and had not been covered up with snow . From my bedroom window I can usually see a red brick building with wrought-iron balconies across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hudson River . It is the only window in the apartment with that particular view . This time , through the scratch , I could see only a little bit of the bricks and none of the Hudson at all . The next day , when I woke up it was ten above . The scratch I had made the first morning had widened slightly and had become covered with a thin glaze of transparent ice . The ice on the inside of the unscratched part of the window had become coarser , and it was harder to scratch , but I willingly lived with the equivalent of frosted glass . I suddenly realized that for most of my life I had felt stuffy and overheated indoors , and I liked the new cool and airy feeling , even though it meant wearing a sweater . In the afternoon , the temperature rose to about eighteen degrees , and the frost on the inside of the window started to melt , producing on the bottom of each pane several receding layers shaped like overlapping hills , with a sky of transparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small icicles carved in bas-relief . The melting process really got under way at about four o'clock that afternoon . Then I could look our of my bedroom window and see the sun set over the Hudson . Its glare was icy white and cold , and the Hudson had turned a frigid green  --  that is , the still liquid part of the river , a small channel in the center between the ice floes . There was a vivid , strong light , seeming to scour and bleach the bricks of the building across the street , malting them look as clean as pebbles on a dry beach . Though the ice floes , the color of the river , and the temperature seemed to indicate a long winter ahead , I rejoiced at the small , premonitory thaw , and , in spite of the suffering I knew that the freeze had caused , I could not help being grateful for the fleeting moment of clarity it had just brought . ? ? Spectacolor CHANGING times in Times Square : the towering Canadian Club sign , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down ; a three-block-long pedestrian mall , which had been on the drawing board for Broadway since 1974 , is going up ( or , at least , has received assurances of federal funds and the clearances necessary to go up ) ; and at the south end of the square New Yorkers now have Spectacolor . We were waiting to cross Broadway at Forty-third Street in the early twilight of a recent afternoon when we first noticed Spectacolor  --  or , more precisely , noticed that we and scores of other rushing pedestrians , and the armed-forces recruiting booth on the island between Broadway and Seventh Avenue , had all been struck magenta by light beams emanating from a large panel about a third of the way up the north facade of the building called One Times Square , the former Times Tower . " Visit the American Numismatic Society , " red and blue lights directed us , and then , in rapid changes of color and configuration , animated lights urged us to see a Broadway show , to buy the magazine Essence , to view an exhibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to try Duro-Lite bulbs , to attend a chamber-music recital at the Brooklyn Academy of Music , to buy L'Eggs panty hose , to buy tickets for a performance of the Negro Ensemble Company , and to dine at the Act Restaurant . Animated-light billboards are not new to Times Square , of course  --  the most prominent example heretofore has been the display over the sign now promoting Carlton cigarettes at Forty-sixth and Seventh  --  but these new lights , marching across a panel labelled " Spectacolor , " were of a much greater order of magnitude and design , and were in changing colors , too . In company with a score of other passersby , we watched the show for about twenty-five minutes , until the displays began to repeat themselves , and during that interval we made a mental note to look into what appeared to be a revolutionary advance in the technology of American advertising . When we got a chance to check on it , in the office of Spectacolor , Inc. , on the fourth floor of One Times Square , we discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ im- provement on some colored signs manufactured in Hungary , which have been operating for some time in Al-Kuwait , in Tijuana , and , without advertising , in Leningrad and on Mayakovsky Square in Moscow . ( We also discovered that the name of the corporation and the device is pronounced as if it were two words ? " specta color . " ) In 1974 , the sign in Al-Kuwait dazzled George Stonhely , the president of a New York advertising agency , and on his return to America he opened negotiations with some American manufacturers about constructing a sign on similar principles for the potential audience of forty-six million people who cross Times Square each month . The panel was installed  --  outside the fifth , sixth , and seventh floors of the building  --  during Thanksgiving week and went into operation December 1st . " We 've put a little less than a million dollars into the operation so far , " said Lawrence Brandon , who is Mr. Stonbely 's father-in-law and a vice-president of the Spectacolor corporation , of which Mr. Stonhely is president " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of the Hungarian ones . Not only are we much brighter  --  we can run in daylight , and they ca n't  --  but we 're animated , where they only flash messages , and we 're also computer-operated , where their signs run on wide tapes that have to be meticulously color-coded by hand . " Mr. Brandon showed us the specifications for the panel overlooking Times Square , and we garnered the following facts : The panel measures twenty by forty feet , has eight thousand one hundred and ninety-two bulbs in it , and draws three hundred and sixty-eight kilowatts . It can be operated at a speed comparable to film at eight frames per second , using twenty-four distinguishable colors , among them cyan , which is a blue-green , and super-white , which is the optical effect when all eight thousand one hundred and ninety-two bulbs flash simultaneously . However , this does not happen very often . The panel is divided into two thousand and forty-eight " pixels , " or picture elements of red , green , blue , and white bulbs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pixel are flashed at any given time . The animation orders come over more than ninety-two miles of wiring , from a computer that is also on the fourth floor of One Times Square . Mr. Brandon took us to its console to meet Rick Schmitz , a young , mustached graphic artist , who does most of the programming , having been recruited from the General Electric Corporation for the purpose . " In many respects , " Schmitz said , " we 're creating our animations the way Disney created his -- only we have the computer , which makes it easier . " We asked whether Mr. Schmitz considered himself a designer or a computer expert . " A designer , " he said firmly . " It 's been found a lot easier to teach computer operation to designers than to teach design to computer people . " In the two months since the board was erected , the Spectacolor corporation has almost reached the break-even point , Mr. Brandon said . " Right now , we 're running about half-and-half public-service announcements and paid spots , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to full commercial operation , though , we 're going to reserve twenty-five per cent of our time for public-service messages . To keep abreast , we change at least forty of them each day , and we 're trying to give priority to museums , free concerts , and art-gallery announcements , because we feel they offer some of the best free entertainment available . We think we have a responsibility to tell the people of this city about some of the great free attractions in town . This is a new medium we 're operating here  --  it is n't electronic and it is n't print , but it has elements of both  --  and we take our public-service responsibilities seriously . " On the way out of One Times Square , we encountered Alex Parker , the real-estate investor who has become the square 's biggest booster since he took over the building  --  first leasing it and then buying it  --  three years ago . " When these guys originally approached me about the sign , last April , my reaction was negative , because it kills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The aesthetics of the thing really jarred me . Rut then I thought , What the hell , flashing bright lights , excitement , attractions  --  is n't that what Times Square is supposed to be all about ? " Art Talker AFIERY redhead with the speed of light , a cloud of blue chiffon , and a hearty " This lecture is about a very good-looking man with rather thin legs who was born just under five hundred years ago and had ideas about hospitality which most of us would FEBRUARY 14 , 19 7 7 End it hard to put into practice " ? who but Rosamond Bernier , talking about Francois I of France , on a recent Wednesday evening at the Metropolitan Museum of Art ? We are not alone in thinking Mme. Bernier the most stylish art talker around . A recent lecture series in the Met 's Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium was sold out two months in advance . Her invigoratingly literate television interviews with Philip Johnsn , the architect , on CBS-TV 's " Camera Three " made the three Sunday mornings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience . Could we catch up with this scintillating creature ( who has been married since 1975 to John Russell , the Times 's equally scintillating art critic ) and importune her with a few questions ? We could and we did . " Imagine being paid to talk ! " Mme. Bernier said to us over lunch in a midtown French restaurant the other day . " I 've been a listener all my professional life , and here I am talking everybody 's head off . " Mme. Bernier 's lecturing self , it seems , rose quite recently from the ashes of her former , publishing-and-writing self . After twenty-odd very busy years in Paris , where she and her ex-husband , Georges Bernier , founded the magarine L'CE1 in 1955 and made it into one of the century 's best art journals , she was , as she put it , left " absolutely fiat " when , in 1969 , she lost both Bernier and EcEil through divorce . " All at once , I had nothing to do , " she said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could to cheer her up , but nothing really helped until Michael Mahoney , an art historian , persuaded her to give fourteen lectures on modern art to hi students at Trinity College in Hartford in the fall of 1970 . " I was terrified at the start , but it worked , " she said . " I 'm probably the only person you know who has n't been psychoanalyzed . Those lectures literally saved my life . " Mme. Bernier , who was born in Philadelphia but grew up mostly in London , approached her subject from the point of view of an active participant . Having arrived in Paris in 1946 as European feature editor for the American Vogue , she followed her natural bent toward art by becoming a close friend of virtually all the important European artists of the period . Picasso took to her because she spoke fluent Spanish as well as French , and she was the first to see and report on his postwar paintings . Matisse saw to it that she wrote the first article on the chapel he was designing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many THE NEW YORKER other artists gave her exclusive interviews and became lifelong Bernierphiles , and from 1955 on they all took a personal interest in the development of In her lectures at Trinity , she was careful to avoid the " **33;5466;TOOLONG " sort of gossip , but her close connection with the Paris art scene , her memory for the telling detail , and her own infectious delight in recapturing the atmosphere of the period made for a wonderfully vivid presentation . The Hartford success led to an invitation from Rice University , in Houston , where she spent a month in 1971 as a guest of John and Dominique de Mend . " Roberto Rossellini was staying with them , too , and we became great friends , " she told us . " What a talker ! He would sit down at the breakfast table and say , ' Pascal n'nvait pas raison , ' or something similar , and we 'd he off on that for an hour . " The Metropolitan Museum heard about her Rice lectures and signed her up for the fall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from places as far apart as Paris ( where she has lectured at the Grand Palais on the painters of the School of Paris ) and Yakima , Washington ( where she spoke last spring on contemporary French painting ) , As one could gather from her Metropolitan lectures on " Four Royal Collectors " ( Francois I , Charles I , Queen Christina of Sweden , and Catherine the Great ) , Mme. Bernier does not limit herself to modern art . L'ail 's slogan was " Thus Its arts , tons lrs pays- , tous les temps , " and Mme. Bernier , who draws upon her years with the magazine for most of her lecture ideas and much of her material , now has more than thirty lectures in her quiver . But whether she is discussing the French Renaissance under Francois I , the Paris of Paul Poiret , or the effect on art of writers such as Baudelaire , Mallarme , Apollinaire , and Proust , she manages to bring to her subject what sounds like firsthand knowledge . " I 'm not a scholar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As a matter of fact , I 've never gone to lectures  --  once , I went to hear Erwin Panofsky , but that 's about it . I 've always loved books and magazines , and playing around with images , and to me making a lecture is just like making a hook . I started projecting two slides simultaneously , side by side , because that 's like having an open hook with facing pages . And I love making the juxtapositions between images , tying things together , without a lot of big blocks of talk . That keeps things moving , and it keeps people amused . I think it 's important to he amused , do n't von ? I must say , after one of my early lectures at the Met I overheard one woman in the audience say to another , ' Well , she 's obviously slept with Leger . I wonder what she 'll have to say next week about Braque . ' Actually , I never slept with any of them , worse luck .

The first was dancing the Charleston and the Black Bottom with Merce Cunningham , at the Whitney Museum dinner for Sandy Calder . Merce Cunningham ! And later John Cage told me that Merce had said he enjoyed it . The second was flying across the country for a lecture , getting off the plane , and seeing a huge sign in red lights that read ' Welcome to Yakima Rosamond Bernier . ' " Bigelow II T Elwood Shipman 's superior and friendly lunch counter at Bigelow I , as it now has to he called , on Sixth Avenue between Eighth and Ninth Streets , the second-oldest pharmacy in the city  --  the store has been in business on the same block since 1838 , and the lunch counter , which was installed in the twenties , is remarkable for roasting a fresh turkey every day and squeezing an estimated fifty thousand oranges every year for always available fresh o.j. ? the talk at breakfast a couple of weeks ago turned on whether the Islanders would pull out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched " Roots " without guilt were kidding themselves , and whether Bigelow I , the about-to-open first drugstore on Roosevelt Island , and the only extant branch store of the Village landmark , would last as long as its famous parent . According to Elwood Shipman , who has managed the Bigelow I lunch counter for eight years , and his affable co-workers , short-order cooks Clifford Brown and Tony Vallejo and counterman ( and orange-squeezer ) Jimmy Mealing  --  they have over seventy-five years of Bigelow experience among them  --  the new place may be able to , provided it adds a lunch counter to its operations within the next eighty years . This department paid its last official visit to the Village store in 1930 , when we fell into conversation with a seventy-nine-year-old Mr. Bigelow , who had vivid memories of his nineteenth-century carriage-trade customers : Commodore Vanderbilt was " tall and crabby looking , " he said , and Mark Twain " never opened his gills ; spoke only to say what he wanted to buy . " On a recent Friday , we aerial-trammed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has taken to calling itself the Little Apple , for the grand opening of Bigelow II , and found ourself talking with Jerry Ginsberg , one of the current owners of Bigelow 's ( his father bought the store in 1939 ) ? a happy man in his Forties who was taping a note that said " This old pharmacy case was built at the turn of the century . It comes from our original store " to a beautiful old glass-fronted display cabinet . The cabinet has three Ionic columns , and the one in the middle turns out to be the handle of the glass door ; when you pull the column , it slides neatly to one side from under its architrave . There are other touches in the new store to remind customers of the Bigelow lineage  --  dark , satin-finished curved wood moldings around the ceiling , conical green metal shades for the hanging lamps , and three slowly turning four-bladed wooden ceiling fans , which the architect and the designer  --  a couple of young fellows named Michael Lawn and Stephen Klein  --  found at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still manufactures four-bladed wooden ceiling fans . Otherwise , the new store , which occupies L-shaped quarters in a towering new apartment house , is bright and up-to-date . The walls and ceiling are spotless white ; the merchandise is easy to see and reach . One wall has a sixteen-foot-long modular , gravity-fed self-service Revlon cosmetic counter  --  the first such unit that Revlon has installed in a retail pharmacy , Jerry Ginsberg said proudly . The pharmacists work in one corner , within view of the customers . Opening-day specials laid on by Jerry Ginsberg included free beauty treatments for women from two non-gravity-fed Revlon cosmetic consultants , and a box of free Russell Stover candies with every purchase . Spontaneous specials included a bottle of Amaretto , which Jerry Ginsberg dispensed sips of in snap-cap clear-plastic five-gram pill vials , and an enormous pound cake , furnished by John J. Guerra 's mother-in-law . Guerra is a partner of Ginsberg 's and the manager of the new store . By noon , the store was full of Raoseveltians making purchases , and we cornered Jerry Ginsberg and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was wearing a druggist 's blue smock  --  to ask them why , after a hundred and thirty-nine years , Bigelow 's had felt like branching out . Ginsberg said , " Well , it 's not our first branch store . We set up the drugstore in the Americana Hotel and ran that for a couple of years . I guess the real reason is that Bigelow 's took a chance on the Village when it was getting started , and we thought it was time to do something like that again , with another New York community getting on its feet . Independently owned pharmacies are closing down in New York State at the rate of two or three a week , according to the Pharmaceutical Society of New York , so we decided to take a stand . " " Only about three thousand people have moved in out here so far , and it has the same small-town atmosphere the Village has , " said Eichel . " Everyone knows everyone else . We 're one of the first stores here . There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pizza parlor , a liquor store , a post office , and a dry cleaner . This morning , Don and Lorraine Parrino , who run the pizza parlor , brought us a dollar bill that said Good luck . Don &; Lorraine ' across its face , so we 'd have a first dollar we could post . We plan to offer the same customized service we offer downtown . We 'll be keeping a patient profile on every customer , we 'll deliver orders , and we 'll be opening charge accounts . " " Even though it costs us two dollars for the paperwork involved in processing the charge of a thirty-nine-cent item , " said Ginsberg . " The only thing different about this store is there 's no place for Marcia , the cat downtown , because Roosevelt Island has a no-pet policy . " " Let 's double-check that , " Eichel said . " The first prescription I filled this morning was for an antibiotic to put in the tank of an octopus . " Ginsberg turned to shake hands with Ed Herschenfeld , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they both started out in life as professional saxophone players , then took up their fathers ' respective professions . " This is our first drugstore , " said Herschenfeld , whose company has built mostly banks and restaurants , including the Magic Pan , in Manhattan . " But how could we resist ? What a location ! Go outside and look at the view . Know what you 're looking at ? Sutton Place . Know what Sutton Place is looking at ? Long Island City ! This is the spot they take the picture postcards from . " At the Parsonage THE last time I saw Estelle Parsons our friend the old curmudgeon , who was looking jauntier than usual , was telling us was in Shubert Alley in 1968 . I was on my way to the Shubert Theatre to pick up a friend of mine , a Princeton classmate who worked in the box office , when she locked horns with me . " Do n't this picket line ! " she an Equity leaflet at me . " Come on , Parsons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn picket line , I 'm picking up a friend to take him to dinner at Franlcie &; Johnnie 's . " " You 're no respecter of women 's rights ! " she shrieked . " The devil I 'm not , " I said . " And I 've suffered for it . " " How ? " she said . " My mother and some of her friends padlocked themselves to the White House fence when they were demanding votes for women , " I said . " A very good photograph of them being loaded into the paddy wagon appeared in the papers the next morning . And that night , when I got home from school , my father , looking bleak , said , ' Children , there will be no dinner tonight . Your mother 's in jail . ' " Parsons is a big , rangy woman , the way all Massachusetts women should be  --  she 's a Marblehead girl , you know . And if you 've ever heard her sing on the stage , you also know she has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I mean fresh  --  from the Academy Award ceremonies , because of her appearance in " Bonnie and Clyde . " And she looked like a cross between Bonnie and Medea herself . I used to see a lot of Parsons in the days before Hollywood , when she was working in a Jerry Herman revue at the Showplace , a night club in the Village , and in Julius Monk 's Upstairs at the Downstairs , in the Fifties . I do n't go to the Village much anymore , because it does n't have anything like the Showplace anymore  --  an occasional visit to Max Gordon at the Village Vanguard , or to a little restaurant just south of Bleecker Street which has some of the best Northern Italian cooking in town , or to Barney Josephson 's Cookery . For a while , I 'd been hearing about a place called the Ballroom , which came into being long after I moved uptown from the Village . It 's down on West Broadway , just below Houston Street , in Solo . I started dropping in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it was the quiet , comfortable sort of place that Lee Chumley 's was in the twenties . It had the same sort of personable customers . The building it 's in must date back to the nineties  --  it 's got those Villagey double wooden doors at the entrance , which is flanked by fluted columns . Inside , it 's long and narrow , which seems to he the way all old buildings are arranged in this city of long , narrow lots . The inside is nearly all white , which makes it look livelier than Chumley 's . There 's a little platform and a piano against one side wall , and on that wall is an enormous mural that depicts the interior and its inhabitants with such verisimilitude that it could just as well be a mirror  --  a funny conceit . Why am I telling you all this ? Because I began to find that on that stage and at that piano quite a few of the people I knew and worked with in my old theatre days were showing up and performing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be sure . Take Galt MacDermot , who did the scores for " Hair " and " Two Gentlemen of Verona , " playing and singing his own songs in a faintly apprehensive manner . Well , O.K. Then I heard that Parsons , reverting to form as a night-club belter , was in for a two-week stand , spelled by Marshall Barer , the lyricist who worked on " Once Upon a Mattress , " in which Carol Burnett climbed twenty mattresses to national fame after she 'd broken the town wide open at the old Blue Angel by singing " I Made a Fool of Myself Over John Foster Dulles . " Doing a one-night stand at the Ballroom , Barer had Anita Ellis singing and Ellis Larkins at the piano . I plunged downtown to the Ballroom , where , fortified by a large chocolate cake and several glasses of white wine , I awaited my opponent . But when she came onstage , in a long black dress , she was a sombre Medea , not a wicked one , and the audience , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new mood . She was deep into show tunes , not all of them familiar , which is always a nice idea , but at last , naturally , the belter in her came through , and she walked off to zounds of applause . Afterward , we broke chocolate cake together , and , pleased to see one another , agreed that any locking of horns was absolutely unnecessary . Next , I guess , I 'll he seeing willowy little Jo Sullivan at the Ballroom . That 'll be a good throwback to her night life and her Broadway musical-comedy days , and she 'll be singing , naturally , a hunch of Frank Loesser songs . And why not ? Soon there will he a three-week repertory of what I guess you 'd have to call " The Best of the New Faces Revues . " It could be that I 've found a new home away from home .
