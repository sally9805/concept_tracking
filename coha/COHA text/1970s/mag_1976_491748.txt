FIT FOR A MAHARAJA As the elephant approaches the lotus flower , so approach the princely recipes of India , slowly and pleasurably . By Shalini Devi Holkar The truism that real life frequently outdoes the wonders of fiction was never more happily illustrated than in the story of the authors if this article . A young lady from Dallas , Texas , while an undergraduate studying political science at Stanford University , met in a classmate a figure similar to one which drifts through the dreams of at least millions of Cinderella-inspired girls every night  --  a young prince , son of the Maharaja of In dare , handsome , dashing , and , unbelievably , single . They were married after graduation in 1966 . Since then , by the Anglicized names of Richard and Sally Holkar , they have lived in India , the United States and France , where they are now rebuilding an old house in Grasse . Shivaji and Shalini , not to lose their musical Indian names too easily , have traveled the length and breadth of India collecting recipes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and studying the vast literature of Indian foods and their preparation . Former princes never dined more sumptuously than we may now , There is a fable in India about the lotus and the elephant . It seems the elephant is passionately fond of eating the lotus flower . He rushes to it , ca n't be coaxed away , stands before it for hours , but is afraid to stretch out his trunk and take a bite . " It might ensnare me with its tendrils , " he frets , " choke me with its heavy leaves , or assail me with the bees it harbors . " What good his enormous limbs ? , concludes the story , the poor beast is bewildered by fear ! When I first arrived in India , I was the elephant , paralyzed in the face of all manner of delights . I had come to be married in the ancestral home of my husband , the son of a former maharaja . Everything was new : speech , dress , customs and food  --  especially food . I remember that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two days before the wedding ceremonies , women of my husband 's family brought me bangles for mywrists , as it is the custom for a wife to wear bangles as long as her husband is alive . Unfortunately my American-size wrists were far too large for the dainty glass bangles and several broke before the ladies retired to search out a larger size . I had better luck with my saris , which did not slip off as I had feared they might ; and with the language , as everyone was kind enough to address me in English . But at table I suffered , for a short time , the fate of the elephant . The food smelled so lovely , looked so tempting , but was so totally unfamiliar . Did I dare venture into this unknown world about which , like so many Westerners , I had certain preconceived notions ? Hesitantly I tried an Indian meal , like the elephant stretching out his trunk . The result : no bite , no sting , just pure pleasure . Thereafter each time I ate Indian food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicious and unexpected . I experienced a whole new realm of tastes , textures and aromas which drew me slowly , fascinated , from the table to the pantry and finally to the kitchens of my new home . There I have spent the the years since that first meal , delving further into both the preparation of food and the philosophy of eating in India . Indian food is so diverse that there is something for everyone ; no one need suffer the elephant 's fate . Contrary to my preconceived notions , Indian food need not be " hot " or heavy or hard to prepare . Nor are ingredients a problem . Renewed interest in cooking in America has made almost all of the necessary ingredients readily available . Dozens of recipes may be prepared with no substitutions or modifications at all . One need only understand a few basic techniques , techniques which I learned in my husband 's kitchens through Dulji , Raja and Jasoda Bai , the meat cook , the vegetable cook and the breadmaker of the household . Dulji and Raja both tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirits from entering our food . At the same time , however , they were perfectly open to my unorthodox , modern suggestions . When I began testing recipes , for example , I substituted my blender for the large , flat stone on which seasonings are traditionally ground . The blender spit rudely in Dulji 's eye the first time he lifted its lid , but in spite of this , he and Raja agreed that it achieved a very good masala or blend of spices and condiments . I learned that the trick to preparing Indian food is to weigh out and arrange the ingredients in advance , all the components of each dish neatly grouped on separate plates or trays , convenient to-the cooking area . So often Indian recipes seem complicated because they have numerous ingredients , when actually they are simple to prepare once the ingredients are all arranged . Certainly the basics of Indian food are simple and extremely wholesome : a variety of pulses or legumes known as dais , unpolished rice , unflavored yogurt and whole wheat flour , from which a variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our kitchen was a soothing and instructive experience . Sitting cross-legged on the floor , she would break off bits of dough from a large mound prepared several hours in advance . With long , supple hands , she formed each little ball of dough , pressed it flat on a small , round wooden board and rolled it into a perfect , flat circle with a tiny , wooden rolling pin . Without breaking this rhythm , she surveyed at the same time the toasting of one bread after another on the heavy iron tawa or griddle . When I set about to imitate Jasoda , however , my distinct lack of success demanded modifications in technique which have simplified the process without altering the end result . The longer I spent in our kitchens , the more I came to see similarities between Indian food and the food I had known in the West . At first the dishes I was learning from Dulji and Raja had seemed totally unfamiliar . There are , for example , very few meat dishes which call for a whole , large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served . Indians most often eat with their fingers ; there is no indigenous eating utensil in India . Both meat and vegetables are therefore cut up or ground before cooking to facilitate eating . The meal may be served on a plate or , more traditionally , on banana leaves in the south and on large , individual platters , called thalis in the north of India . Each dish is ladled separately into small bowls , grouped around a mound of rice or poured into little wells hollowed directly into the rice . If there is chapati and no rice , the chapati ( or any other of the wholewheat breads ) is used to transport the food from bowl to mouth . Many of the dishes are quite saucy , so the bowl or the rice is a necessity . It segregates the different flavors and textures , which each person then mixes to his taste as an artist would mix his colors on a canvas . In the face of all this unfamiliarity , I , still at heart the elephant , clung to dishes such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which makes a mouth-watering lunch served on crisp toast and accompanied by green salad and the light , cooling yogurt dessert which Dulji taught me one summer afternoon . Having mastered basic techniques and a few simple recipes , I was ready to venture afield . The Maharaja of Sailana , a small neighboring state , was kind enough to offer me hospitality and guidance . His Highness of Sailana descends from a long line of keen gourmets and enthusiastic recipe collectors . He himself cooks almost every day , measuring each ingredient with elaborate precision unlike Dulji and Raja , who were content with " a pea of this and a cigarette box of that , " to my occasional desperation . His Highness shared with me a recipe which is something of a state treasure , as His Late Highness had gone to great lengths to acquire it from a famous street vendor in faraway North India . He had , in fact , cleverly extracted the real recipe from the man , who had every intention of giving him a falsified version . This was accomplished during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leaving him to his own devices . Naturally whenever no one was watching , the cook added an ingredient or two without bringing it to anyone 's attention . Unbeknownst to him , however , everything in the spice box had been carefully weighed and His Highness had only to reweigh the remains to decipher the poor man 's secret . The result , Seekh Kabobs , make a delicious hors d'oeuvre or , wrapped in a chapati , an Indian sausage beloved of children . With my confidence bol-stered by His Highness ' en-couragement , I set out with my husband on a culinary od-yssey of much of the Indian subcontinent . Kishengarh came first , a small state near New Delhi , on the fringes of Rajasthan . I remember driving between fields of poppies to reach Kishen-garh . It was February and they were in full flower . Already I knew the delights of poppy seeds in recipes such as Seekh Continued an page 20 Kabobs , make a delicious hors d'oeuvres or , wrapped in a chapati , an Indian sausage beloved of children . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set out with my husband on a culinary odyssey of much of the Indian subcontinent . Kishengarh came first , a small state near New Delhi , on the fringes of Rajasthan . I remember driving between fields of poppies to reach Kishengarh . It was February and they were in full flower . Already I knew the delights of poppy seeds in recipes such as Seekh Kabobs , but I was unprepared for the beauty of the chilies we found drying in the courtyard of Kishengarh Palace , masses of color from bright green to orange to red . Like so many Westerners , I had come to associate hot red chilies with Indian cuisine so it came as a surprise to learn that chilies did not make their appearance in India until the sixteenth century , when Portuguese explorers introduced them . They obviously caught on well ; but already I knew that there are many dishes in India which are neither hot with chilies and spices nor heavy with oil . Spicy food developed in India out of the simple , basic need to preserve food without refrigeration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil or clarified butter in quantity also aided in preserving the food . All this began several centuries ago , but in spite of the advent of refrigeration , necessity became habit and habit , preference ; so that now many Indians find spiceless food bland and inedible and most love quantities of butter or oil which we in the West find excessive and which in fact is not necessary to the flavor of the food if one is not fond of it . We used a few of the chilies from the courtyard in preparing the recipe for Five Minute Fowl under the ruler 's supervision and , in fact , in the living room . The whole cooking lesson lasted exactly ten minutes and the results were extraordinary . The original of this recipe called not for game hens , but for partridge or sand grouse , once abundant in Rajasthan . The former Princely States of Jodhpur , Jaisalmer and Bikaner , which we visited after Kishengarh , were once renowned for their sand grouse shoots and for the spicy game such as black buck and wild boar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old nobleman of Jodhpur State , as we sat on the palace veranda watching him prepare a specialty of Rajasthan . Our noble cook , then over eighty years old , often confused today with yesteryear and English with Swahili , which he had picked up on safari in Africa more than sixty years before . Still his culinary touch was clear and true ; we never tasted a better Nardi . After leaving Jodhpur , in fact , we tasted nothing at all for longer than we had expected . Our next rendezvous , with the erstwhile maharaja of a romantic desert kingdom , was canceled on the very day we were to meet , as Her Highness gave birth to a son , the first after five daughters . We attended a few of the festivities , then drove on to Bikaner , so well known for its Camel Corps and Imperial Sand Grouse . Amongst gourmets , Bikaner is also well known for its delicate papads and crystal sugar , formed on lengths of hemp rope which glisten in the central bazaar . Real desert fare is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would reproduce well abroad . Jaipur , the next Princely State we visited , proved even poorer . His Highness was absent , so we sought out the palace cook , whoassured us he was highly flattered and would willingly assist . He needed , said he , only twenty-five rupees for the purchase of pencil and paper that he might inscribe for us his humble recipes . Twenty-five rupees were duly given ; and we never saw the cook again . At that point , we departed for cooler climes . Kashmir is a sylvan and secretive valley at the northernmost tip of India . The cooks of the late Maharaja of Kashmir were extremely cooperative , introducing me to their cuisine with bemused good grace . Meat dominates a Kashmiri meal , rather than vegetables . Rice  --  a full tray of it for each person  --  acts as a background for the meat and absorbs the delicious sauces . Whole wheat breads are rarely eaten and chilies play a relatively minor role . Travelers take readily to the succulent meat and creamy sauces of this unique cuisine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we think of Indian food . The word curry is believed to come from a Tamil or South Indian word which means , literally , containing yogurt . A curry can be as simple as plain yogurt , seasoned with ground red chili , pepper and salt . That ground red chili , pepper and salt form a basic masala or curry powder , as it has come to be called in the West . There are as many masalas or curry powders as there are possible combinations of the myriad spices employed in Indian cooking . Only a few of these are widely known outside of India . The bottled varieties are heavy with the flavor of turmeric and make every dish taste the same , an idea which would puzzle Indians , accustomed to great variety in their masalas . Availability of ingredients in India has never been a problem ; the country is rich in spices . Marco Polo was one of the first to record his astonishment at such wealth : In this kingdom there is great abundance of pepper and also of ginger , besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which Marco Polo refers is South India , our next destination and truly a land of abundance . Accompanied by our erudite and affectionate guide , Secretary to H.H. Travancore-Cochin , we experienced one culinary delight after the next : giant prawns from the Sea of Oman , frog legs seined from the backwaters , rice from emerald fields in the lowlands , coffee and tea from the highlands , coconuts , cashews and everywhere magnificent mango trees . In the one short hour we followed our friend through a mango grove , sheltering ourselves from the sun with huge black umbrellas , he pointed out to us over two dozen varieties of edible mangoes , the largest of which was the size of a small watermelon . None of us suffered the elephant 's fate then ; we all stretched out our trunks eagerly . The best way to eat a mango , said our guide , is to eat it just as it is . Cut a portion off the top , where the stem was , slip a large spoon down into its center and carefully wedge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very untidy task . We returned to his home in the evening light to share with his family a simple meal served on banana leaves . There was rice and yogurt , fresh mangoes , tamarind water and a cauliflower dish so unusual I asked for the recipe . There have been many , many other experiences : in Hyderabad , Mysore , the eastern hill states , and I hope there will be many more . But I have always kept in mind one of the very first lessons I learned in my husband 's kitchens . Dulji and Raja made me sit down , have a cup of tea and approach my cooking lesson calmly . The elephant , it seems , when he gathers his courage and actually begins to eat , savors each little morsel of the lotus flower in exquisite contemplation . That is how Indian food should be approached , slowly and pleasurably .

Rub it inside and out with a cut lime . If the fowl is no larger than a partridge , leave it whole . Stuff it loosely with salt and truss securely . Larger birds should be cut into serving pieces and salted . Half-fill deep fryer or medium-sized high-sided pot with oil . Heat over a high burner for 10 minutes or until oil just begins to smoke . Using tongs , slide in as Continued on page 33 cooking , pour the flour into a deep mixing bowl . Make a well in the center and pour in 1/4 cup water . Gather the flour into a ball , squeezing and pressing . Add up to 1/4 cup more water ( by spoonfuls ) until the flour adheres easily but is not pasty or sticky . Punch and press it for a few seconds with the knuckles . Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and continue punching , pressing and folding for 10 to 15 minutes , or until the dough is quite smooth and elastic . Set the smooth ball aside to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damp cloth . About 20 minutes before eating , preheat the oven to warm . Divide the dough into 5 equal balls , and roll each of these into a 6-inch flat circle , dusting with flour as necessary . Cover each with a damp towel when it is ready . Heat a large heavy iron or nonstick skillet or griddle until a drop of water dances on it . Do not grease it . One by one toast the breads  --  about a minute on each side ( or until dark spots begin to show ) . Move the bread almost constantly with the fingertips , but turn only once . When the second side is toasted , press it gently but firmly with a folded cloth for 1 second . Remove the cloth ; the bread will puff up . Immediately transfer it to the oven .
