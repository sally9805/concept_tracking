Having forced oil companies to swallow two major price increases over the past year , the eleven nations that sit atop the world 's rich pools of oil are now demanding a piece of the companies themselves . Their goal is " participation , " , which is merely another way of describing partial , and probably increasing nationalization of the U.S. and European firms that drill in their territory . At a meeting in Beirut of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) , which ended last week , the largest consortium of oil companies , the Arabian American Oil Co. , bowed to the inevitable and agreed in principle to sell 20% of its ownership to Saudi Arabia . Aramco 's decision will doubtless cause a gusher of further participation concessions , which will increase the economic and political power of the producing nations , most of them in the Middle East . <P> Even so , the ownership issue between OPEC and the companies is far from resolved . The two sides have not agreed on the timing of the sale or how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far the most difficult obstacle is how the price will be figured . The OPEC governments want to calculate their bill simply by totaling the book value of a company 's equipment , real estate and other holdings . By that measure , Aramco , which is jointly owned by Standard Oil of California , Jersey Standard , Texaco and Mobil , is worth some $500 million . Yet company officials rightly believe that as the holder of a concession on Saudi Arabia 's fabulous oil reserves until 1999 , Aramco has a much higher commercial value . They insist on compensation for the loss of future profits . <P> Oil company officers hope to make up for at least part of their losses by expanding shipping and marketing operations , which are not affected by the drive toward participation . Nevertheless , the price of oil sold by partially nationalized operations will undoubtedly go up . Since the trend is beginning in the Middle East , the higher prices are expected to hit first in Europe and Japan , where customers depend on Moslem nations for nearly all of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the deal with Saudi Arabia will continue this week , though no final agreement is expected for months . OPEC made it clear that member nations are more unified than ever in their determination to gain part ownership of the companies . OPEC members are considering starting a multimillion-dollar special fund " to assist any member country affected by actions taken against it by oil companies . " Presumably the money could be used to keep afloat nations whose oil might be boycotted by Western oil buyers in participation disputes . Eventually the producing countries hope to get at least 51% control of the company operations in their areas .
