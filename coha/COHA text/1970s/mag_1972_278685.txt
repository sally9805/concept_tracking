Since nudism has been stripped of whatever peephole provocativeness it once had , the American Sunbathing Association is now opting for an open-door policy . Under a plan recently announced by Association President Robert G. Johnston , some 130 U.S. nudist camps are emerging from their traditional reclusion . " We 've decided to come out of the woodwork and operate competitive recreational facilities rather than cults or philosophical retreats , " Johnston explains . " We 're inviting the public to come visit us just as they would visit Disney World . " <P> The new nudism will still be different from ogling Donald or Goofy . Johnston figures to charge $5 per family at most facilities , with no special prices for single men and women . Few camps will allow novices to keep their clothes on after several visits . Says Johnston : " Motels do n't screen guests , so why should we ? But we do invite the men to bring their girl friends . "                  @ @ @
