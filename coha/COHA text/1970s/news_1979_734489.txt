txt December is already proving a cold , testing month for most of the Republican presidential contenders . , Only Ronald Reagan and , to a lesser degree , George Bush are feeling the warm glow of success ? the former California governor because his commanding lead is holding up , and the onetime UN ambassador because he is creating news media attention . The Iranian hostage affair has aided Mr. Reagan 's " ball control " strategy , political analysts and pollsters agree . " The Reagan thesis is , Reagan has it the nomination , " West Coast pollster Mervin D. Field says . " The strategy is to run him as an incumbent ? with set speeches , and as few as possible . It 's ball control . What he wants is a fast clicking of the clock , until the convention in August . The Iranian thing is like a long timeout called by the referee . " " It 's really Reagan 's race to lose , " Mr. Field says . " He 'd have to stumble . " The December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Connally of Texas and Howard H. Baker Jr . of Tennessee . " Iran is creating problems for candidates like Connally who want to present themselves as strong commentators , " says James Nowlan , Illinois Republican and political scientist . " It has forced them to be constrained , with time shortening before the primaries . " Despite a year of heavy spending and hard campaigning , Mr. Connally has not been able to gain ground on Mr. Reagan . " People still do n't really know how to categorize Connally with confidence , " Mr. Nowlan says . " Survey research shows concerns about Connally the man , a high negative perception of him . People are pulling back from him . " The Kennedy candidacy , at least in the short run , also appears to be helping Mr. Reagan . In key states like Illinois , where voters can still choose which party primary to vote in , moderate Republicans and independents may be drawn over into the Democratic primary by a tight // From page 1 Reagan plays ' ball control ' to keep GOP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center-right Republicans who are strongly for Mr. Reagan . Connally camp spokesmen concede that the early tests in Iowa and New Hampshire will not be two-man affairs between their man and Mr. Reagan . Mr. Connally will have to show " Reagan is vulnerable " in the South , they agree . Even that will be tough , however , because fellow Texan George Bush has begun to show he , too , must be reckoned with . In the Florida nonbinding caucus this fall , Mr. Bush did surprisingly well . And in Texas , too , the former Central Intelligence Agency chief has begun to move . " So far , it 's been Connally against Reagan in Texas , " says Wayne Thorburn , executive director of the Texas Republican Party . " But it 's shifting more toward a three-way race with Bush . " Mr. Bush 's strength , in addition to effective organization , has been " smart " campaigning . " You ca n't lay a glove on him on any stand he 's taken , " pollster I. A. Lewis says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Baker campaign confirmed its already visible problems this week by sharply changing strategy ? focusing on the few early tests and stepping up campaigning . " Baker has slipped badly , " Mr. Lewis says . " Baker is remembered for Watergate . But this does n't help him gain ground . " " It 's a race of one , " Mr. Lewis says . " If Reagan is beaten , he 'll have to beat himself . The fact that Connally has committed himself to publicity and TV so early means he 's either revolutionized American politics , or it 's desperation time . He has to knock Reagan off somewhere . It does n't do him any good to beat Baker or Bush . " ? However , analysts say , if Mr. Connally " goes after " Ronald Reagan , breaking the no-attack gentlemen 's agreement among the Republican contenders , moderates Bush and Baker would more likely benefit than Mr. Connally himself . Former President Ford 's absence from an active race has helped Governor Reagan more than it has benefited moderates Baker and Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford ' and Reagan could have battled it out and made room for someone else , " he says , since Mr. Ford would have cut into Mr. Reagan . " In the key primary states , Reagan is way out front with 40 percent , and Baker , Bush and Connally are grouped together at about 12 percent each , " says David Keene , political director of the Bush campaign . " We 're still in the period of testing the strength of the Reagan candidacy , " Mr. Keene says . " The Kennedy announcement and Iran have postponed that testing by the press and others . Mr. Reagan announced and then disappeared . He wo n't reappear until after the first of the year . " Mr. Reagan 's lead on key traits like " effectiveness " and " trust " is substantial . In an NBC News/AP poll taken Nov. 27-28 , he led Messrs . Connally , Baker , and Bush by more than 2 to 1 among Republicans in perceptions of him as an effective leader , and by 3 to 1 in " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
