txt THE POLITICAL , fallout from me unexpected victory of Jane Byrne over Mayor Bilandic was felt all over Chicago last week . Almost everyone was crying , cneermg , speculating , or complaining about the miraculous turn in Democratic Party politics . Many now think the fallout ? ? easily could reach beyond the , old Democratic Machine . Wallace Johnson , a 52-year-old investment banker , is ready and waiting . Johnson took the run for the Republican party nomination when few others wanted any part of it . Now , with Bilandic 's defeat and the machine obviously weakened , Johnson 's quixotic chase has taken on a new look . He talked recently with The Tribune about that race and his possible future as mayor of Chicago . The following is ar . edited transcript of thot converse . lion . Q. ? How do you now assess your chances for election ? Are you a serious candidate ? A ? Well , I 've always been a serious ' candidate , but ti ? s media and everybody else treated it as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's win . dispells the psy // Q. 8 ( A . Johnson to stress economics // etiology that the machine ca n't be beaten . They had the people all beaten down with that for a number of years . Q ? Then you think you now have a good chance of pulling it off ? A ? I do n't think there 's any question about it . First , remember that the victory Jane Byrne enjoys is due to the Republican Party . By my estimate there were at least 80,000 voters who went over front the Republican Party to vote in the Democratic primary . So she owes her victory to the Republicans and the independents . Q ? Is there any question in your mind that all those Republican voters will come home to you ? A ? Absolutely none . The voting public today is very sophisticated . A lot of blacks that they used to scare , they 're all protected by Civil Service today . They 're more aware today than they 've ever been that they can vote the way they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at political campaign dinners but they 're gon na vote the way they want to vote . As I 've traveled the campaign trail , any number of people have told me , " I 'm voting for Jane Byrne in the primary , and I 'm voting for you in April . " Q ? Have you had any solid commitments of support from any disgruntled regular Democrats In the aftermath of the election ? A ? I have not , but I 'm pretty sure I 'll pick up some of that support . Ed Quigley West Side ward boss said there was no way he is going to support Byrne . I think obviously I 'll be the recipient of some of that . Also , if she is embraced by the Democratic organization or any segments of it , it 's going to destroy her with the independents and it 's going to destroy her with Don Rose Byrne 's campaign strategist the guy who has really made her . The reason they went with . her was because they felt she was a crusader , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What issues do you intend to press now ? A ? I 'm going to press the financial aspects because they 're very important . People today are conscious of the cost of government . They found out if you do n't give the bureaucrat something he can't.spend it . What we need to do is cut out waste in government and duplication in government . We need to reduce the taxes , get a handle on these things , and get spending in line . If you tell people to cut their budget 10 per cent , they go about cutting their budget 10 per cent . I 'm a businessman , not really a politician , and I 'm going to go about running the city like a business . But I realize there have been some accommodations made with some practical aspects . Q ? What accommodations ? A ? For instance , we 're going to redirect a lot of the moneys that have been spent downtown or are purportedly going to be spent downtown . lie specifically mentioned the Deep Tunnel project , the Franklin Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed for high visibility in the Loop . The fact is the neighborhoods really have been shorted . They look like a shambles . I would not redirect all of it , but I 'd redirect part of it . The neighborhoods in the last 10 years have only had , something like $500 million , or $50 million it year , directed to them . I 'd put at least 10 percent of that $40 billion spent downtown back out there Tribune Pilate by Sally Good Wallace Johnson in the neighborhoods . ? ' Q ? Would n't the downtown businessmen squawk ? A ? I do n't think they 'd object a great deal to it . If you 're getting a 90-10 cut , it 's not exactly all bad . Q ? What other issues will you press ? A ? lobs . I think jobs are very important . In the city proper for the last 10 years , we 've lost about 180,000 jobs . They 've moved to the suburbs . We have an " Irritation Tax , " as I call it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bankers Life and Casualty Co. bought 40 acres and moved to Rolling Meadows . In 71/2 years , the head tax savings alone will pay for the land . Eliminate the tax . Q ? Jane Byrne has said she will favor contracts for policemen and firemen . Of course , city workers would come right behind them . What is your stand on such contracts ? A ? I stand ready to negotiate a contract for all of these people . Philosophically it Is hard not to when teachers , CTA workers , building trades people , all have contracts , and you 're just leaving out a very small fraction . No-strike clauses and binding arbitration would have to be considered . It would be negotiable . . I do n't have a closed mind on it . Let 's put it like that . I could favor it under certain circumstances , and it would n't bother me . Q ? Problems with snow removal and transportation probably beat Elfondle . How would you have met those problems ? A ? Let 's take transportation first . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I know about transportation . The CTA obviously had some failures , most of it not their fault . They were mechanical factors , like motors-failing , motors ' put out here by General Electric . The other problem was brakes that were bad and going out on some of the Boeing cars . GE would have to bear part of the responsibility for this in ply judgement , and Boeing on the brakes . I 'd have had people from those companies in here like NOW . I 'm a can-do ? it-now guy . I move . And I go right to the top and get it done . Q ? ilow would you improve transportation ? A ? I 've tried to initiate Park and Ride facilities where we would build garages out farther from the center of the city . People could drive in there , park their cars , and come downtown . An extension of that idea would be to . have the oil companies build the facility in return for a long-term lease . It would cost the city nothing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they could put their installaiton in and sell their products  --  gas , oil , whatever . 41 ? How would you have met the snow removal problems ? A ? Well , you can pick on the snow removal problem as much as you want to . If there really was any problem with the snow removal , it was that they did n't get lend time on the snow and they did n't get out there and do it . If I were mayor and recognized that I had a problem on my hands such as that one , I would have called out the army , the National Guard , the State of Illinois with all its equipment . I would have gone on television to talk to the people about the problem . Q ? How does a Republican banker plan to get the support of the city 's ethnics , people who seemingly hold the key to election ? A ? If I have a political base anywhere it , is on the South Side of Chicago . I moved from there a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Byrne , and I 'll bet they go 2 to 1 for Johnson . I 'm sure some are going to try to hang that Fat Cat image around my neck . I can dispose of that quickly by my record of service . Let them talk to the people I 've worked , with in the hospitals and the Salvation : Army . , Q ? Who will you bring into your admialitration ? A-I 'll tell you what I would n't do . I would n't go in there and fire everybody . That would n't be any way to run a business or a government . Police Supt. James O'Grady 's job is safe with me . Fire Commissioner Richard Albrecht is safe . Unless they demonstrate incompetence . There would be shifts , but they would n't be abrupt . Q ? What have you heard from the Republican Party since the election ? Is it now going to do more to help you ? A ? There will be an increase in its activity . I 've no doubt about that . The party would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it with enthusiasm . Q ? Is funding now going to get easier ? Are new sources opening ? . A ? The mark of a good businessman or a good campaigner is ' to raise the money that he needs . No more , no less . Bilandic had a million dollars , and it did n't do him any good .. It had said much earlier that $250000 was about what I 'd need . Now it.seems that was right target . I 'm sure the United Republican Fund will give us a tour-figure contribution . Q ? Have yen heard from the national party ? Will they come up with some money ? A ? I 've heard nothing from them since the election . They said they were already pretty far in debt when I talked to them ' before . They said the would . send people , but , it 's been my experience that when they . ? send peoplpe it only ends up costing you money . They live pretty well , and you pay for . it . Q ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step aside for a more well-known Republican , candidate , If you were asked by the party leadership , would you consider it ? A ? No . No , No . The fact is that anyone who knows me knows I 'd be insulted . When you come from the farm to the top of La Salle Street , you got ta have a little muscle on the bone . r in not going to give up .
