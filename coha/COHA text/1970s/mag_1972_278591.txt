William Blake saw the world 's wonders in a grain of sand . Victor Papanek sees its iniquities in a chrome-plated marmalade guard for toast . Dean of the design school at the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia , Papanek argues his view in a controversial new book , Design for the Real World ( Pantheon ; $8.95 ) , which blames industrial designers for almost every variety of pollution and waste . <P> To the layman , these designers may seem innocuous people who spend their time adding chrome strips to auto bodies , streamlining fountain pens , creating bright new packages . But Papanek indicts his own colleagues for forgetting the context of their innovative work . Since they occupy a key position in the transformation of an idea into a product , he says , designers could insist on manufacturing processes that do not damage the environment . Instead , he charges , their primary aim is to increase sales through wasteful changes in style . They also clutter the market with basically useless products - electrically heated footstools , ballpoint pens crowned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of " fieshlike vinyl . " <P> Candle Radio . As Papanek sees it , designers should turn to the problems of the " real world , " particularly the problems of the world 's poor . He and one of his students have designed a simple radio that is being manufactured in Indonesia as a cottage industry under UNESCO sponsorship . Powered by heat rising from a candle , the radio looks ugly but costs only 90 , com plete with an earplug . In Africa , Papanek and another student sought a cheap means of preserving food . Their solution : a " cooling unit " insulated by walls of native fiber . It works for twelve hours on 20 minutes of cranking , holds 4.5 cu . ft. of food and costs less than $6 . Thousands of other simple products - inexpensive stoves , water pumps , oil lamps-beg to be designed . <P> Even for the affluent U.S. , Papanek lists scores of useful items that designers have never bothered to make . For example , there is still no inexpensive pill bottle that dispenses one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tampering . There is no practical pocket-size Braille writer , no simple gas and electricity meter , no well-designed first-aid kit , no cheap hearing aid ( though transistor radios using the same basic technology cost only $3.98 ) . He himself had to invent a cloth book his infant daughter might enjoy , complete with bright colors and different textures . <P> Papanek , whose rhetoric is so extreme at times that he calls corporation executives " criminals , " has already run into many critics who argue that he himself has lost contact with the real world . Some do not believe that designers can-or should-break their links to industry . Others doubt whether people truly want useful things , as defined by Papanek ; they argue that the desire for embellishment in the design of cars or clocks , and even the demand for $1 diapers for parakeets , is just as real as the need for 90 radios . Finally , the critics denounce as Utopian Papanek 's theory that better products can improve men 's lives and outlook ; only a fundamental change of philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the value-and values-of designers to be thoroughly provocative .
