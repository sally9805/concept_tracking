There are three kinds of senses : physical , common and non . <P> The first is used ( and abused ) by everyone . The last has become the property of infants , absurdists and politicians . And the one in the middle ? Strung between the poles of the superrational and the occult , it suffers from disuse and neglect . The nation suffers along with it . <P> There was a time when native intelligence was the salient American virtue . When Citizen Tom Paine wished to incite his countrymen , he titled his pamphlet Common Sense . His colleague Benjamin Franklin made a career of common sense ; Poor Richard was a seed catalogue of utilitarian philosophy ( " The used key is always bright " ) . By the early 19th century , De Tocqueville noted that Poor Richard had gone public . " Without ever having taken the trouble to define the rules of a philosophical method , " he wrote , Americans " are in possession of one , common to the whole people . " <P> The method : shrewd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , the wits could solve . At the zenith of the Darwinian revolution , Oliver Wendell Holmes assured his countrymen : " Science is a first-rate piece of furniture for a man 's upper-chamber , if he has common-sense on the ground floor . " <P> But in the 20th century , that floor became cluttered with the jargon and rhetoric of specialists and experts . Occasionally , a native wit would appear and be lionized for his logic-Will Rogers , for example , or for that matter , Dr. Spock , who shrewdly titled his 1946 volume The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care . But by midcentury , sense was no longer common . Today the American public can be intimidated by those who ask Chico Marx 's question : " Who you gon na believe , me or your own eyes ? " <P> ITEM : The Energy Crisis . As every driver knows , automobiles , not nations , now stand accused of the abuse of power ( 65% of American workers inefficiently drive to their jobs-most of them sans passengers ) . Common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , buses and subways . Instead , the House of Representatives has just refused to allow new funds for mass transit . Meanwhile , as fuel supplies dwindle , new appliances are creating absurd demands . Among other concerned legislators , Senator Henry Jackson concludes : " We need to ask whether we must despoil the hills in Appalachia to air-condition sealed-glass towers in New York . We need to ask whether we must put ourselves in hock to Middle East sheikdoms to keep roads clogged with gas-hungry cars . " As yet , Americans have not answered , nor even asked , those sensible questions .
