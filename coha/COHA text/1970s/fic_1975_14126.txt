A living room in a rented shack on the Pacific Coast . Bare feeling , a transient place being made permanent . Couch , a few tattered easy chairs , eating table , bookcase with mildewed books and a few new ones , mostly paperbacks . Franklin stove . Indian rug . Against wall a .22 rifle , a cavalry sword , three fishing rods . Portable Sony TV . And like that . It 's morning . It 's drizzling . The Northwest . Robbie sleeps on the couch with a powder-blue sleeping bag pulled over him and an open book on the floor . Lights up . Enter Bill , holding an egg . He sees Robbie asleep . Checks him out . Makes a loud rooster noise . Robbie stirs . Bill walks around the room , strutting and crowing like a rooster . He stops . ROBBIE Oh shit . Is it Tuesday ? BILL BARENBERG Wednesday , m'boy . No , wait . It 's July , definitely . ROBBIE Let 's skip today . I want to have tomorrow , O.K. BILL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got . ROBBIE ( Looking ) Small whitish object . Spheroid . I give up . BILL BARENBERG An egg . I found it underneath the chicken out in the coop. p. 3 ROBBIE Coincidence . Eggs come from Safeways . I hate waking up . BILL BARENBERG Our chicken has laid a egg . A white egg . And just wait 'll you taste it . Country chicken eggs are amazing , young Rob . They are tasty and they are funky and they are real . ROBBIE You know what I think ? BILL BARENBERG You just do n't want to admit country living is far out . Well , you 're wrong ' cause country living happens to be far out and if you do n't believe me read your Whole Earth Catalogue and your crazy Euell Gibbons and you 'll see it written in plain undeniable black and white . ROBBIE Shelly put that egg under the chicken . BILL BARENBERG Now why would a nice girl like Shelly go and do a deceitful thing like that ? ROBBIE ' Cause you said you 'd chop off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't crank out an egg by today . BILL BARENBERG ( Pause ) How come you 're sleeping in here ? ROBBIE My room 's haunted . I was having a nightmare . BILL BARENBERG Want to shoot some gophers ? ROBBIE No. p. 4 BILL BARENBERG Want to go fishing ? High tide 's 10:27 . I got bait . ROBBIE I was down at Angel Point , night , you know , pitch black and the tide was way , way out and I was stepping along these rocks . Except they were all wet and covered with seaweed and I kept losing my balance . Then I was lying down . Yeah . My face was right up close against the rocks and I was looking down at them like I was in a helicopter over a city . Hovering , sort of . And I could n't believe it how every single inch of those rocks had some kind of living thing on it , every chink , every crevice . Mussels . Gooseneck barnacles . Anemones . Stuff I do n't even know what it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to reach down and and Then I felt myself moving , like gliding real slowly just above the rocks and I realized I was heading straight for the ocean faster and faster and I got real panicky and started reaching out toward the rocks trying to find a place to grab on to but there was no room , everything was covered with all this slippery , living stuff and I tried to scream but the surf was too loud ( Pause ) I want to sleep . BILL BARENBERG Me too . ROBBIE What ? BILL BARENBERG I had the same dream . ROBBIE Leave me alone . p. 5 BILL BARENBERG Remember when you used to dream about flying and cowboys and chicks with wet sissies . ROBBIE Yeah . Sheeet . ( Spits ) BILL BARENBERG Sheeet . ( Spits ) Shelly dreamed she had a job . She 's really upset . It was sort of a nightmare . ROBBIE Well , we 've had dreams now . Time for emptying of the bowels and cleansing of the skin . Another day , another trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BILL BARENBERG Safeways . Morning milk run . And by the way , in case you forgot , last night Reilly said he was gon na come today . ROBBIE Oh , shit , Reilly . That 's real life , is n't it ? BILL BARENBERG Yep . Time for a joint . ROBBIE That 's going to be a problem because I smoked the last of our stash last night . I could n't sleep . BILL BARENBERG Things are really getting desperate . Like twenty-one fifty-seven in the bank desperate . And no dope . ROBBIE And not a whole lot of food either . BILL BARENBERG Fuck food . I 'm talking basics . p. 6 ROBBIE At least we got eggs . One a week at the present rate . That is , if Shelly is n't behind this sudden mysterious egg phenomenon . BILL BARENBERG I figure we can get Reilly down from fifteen hundred . I do n't think the boat 's worth that . If we go really heavy on the condition the boat 's in I bet we can jew him down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're the Jew , you do the talking . BILL BARENBERG Maybe nine hundred . ROBBIE That 's nine with two zeros after it . BILL BARENBERG We 're a nice bunch of kids . ROBBIE Straight from the shoulder , I have reservations . BILL BARENBERG We can dig up a thousand . There 's got ta be a way . I mean between you and me and Shelly , and maybe someone else 'd come in for a share like maybe crazy Rory the undertaker . ROBBIE I 'm talking more about Reilly 's boat . I mean , I 'm not exactly an old salt or anything , but if we 're gon na do commercial salmon fishing we have to have a boat with certain basic things , right , like a tendency to stay on top of the water . I heard Reilly 's boat sunk three times last winter . BILL BARENBERG Yeah , but that was at the dock , that was n't out on the ocean . p. 7 ROBBIE Is that supposed to make me feel better ? BILL BARENBERG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can bail them out . If you 're not there , of course they 'll sink . ROBBIE I 'd only like a boat that did n't sink . Even when you were n't there . BILL BARENBERG All boats leak . ROBBIE How do you know so much about boats all of a sudden ? Listen , pal o ' mine , it just so happens I 've read all kinds of seafaring books , and the one distinguishing factor about all the major historical oceangoing hot shits is they all had boats that floated , dock or no . BILL BARENBERG You always sit around figuring out the bad news , do n't you ? Ever since you got here . ROBBIE I just know your dreams , Billy-boy . I can see your fleet of five hundred fully automated vacuum-cleaner-type fishing tankers with radar-equipped salmon detectors and canning plants in the hold and stereophonic P.A. blasting out Pink Floyd on the quarter deck or whatever the fuck you call it ; **52;795;TOOLONG Pacific Salmon Outta Sight Enterprises , Inc . BILL BARENBERG Some of us do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of us have to make a living . p. 8 ROBBIE My old man 's bread is not my bread . Leave me alone . BILL BARENBERG Come on , bummer , do n't tell me you have n't heard that old ocean calling . You 're the one that sat out there on Angel 's Point all day , and all night , and all the next day staring at it when you first got here . Ah , silence . High tide , calm sea , beer and dope and some funky sounds on the cassette , sea trout crawling up your line begging to be fried in bread crumbs with a little garlic and sage . I 'm telling you , man , that old ocean is just one great big mamma with a smile on her face and food in her belly . All we need is a boat and a few smarts and she 'll lay great abundance upon us at seventy-nine cents a pound and that adds up . ROBBIE Ho-hum , another day , another trip . ( Shelly enters with brown paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) What ? SHELLY Ed Nolan 's taking all my pots . Every one of ' em . BILL BARENBERG Did he pay you ? SHELLY No , on consignment . It 's cool . The tourist season 's almost starting , and he 's gon na put the fruit bowl and the yellow mugs right in the big display window . p. 9 BILL BARENBERG When do you get some money ? SHELLY When he sells one of my things , stupid . ROBBIE Congratulations . SHELLY Thanks . ( Pause ) So , what 's happening ? BILL BARENBERG Shelly-pie . SHELLY What ? BILL BARENBERG Shelly-pie . SHELLY What 's on your mind ? BILL BARENBERG Have you been out to the chicken coop this morning ? SHELLY Why should I go out there ? BILL BARENBERG Think carefully , Shelly-pie . Have you had any social interaction with Guinevere in the past twelve hours ? ROBBIE Look out , it 's a trap . BILL BARENBERG Did you put an egg under Guinevere 's body this morning ? SHELLY She laid an egg ? ! ! Guinevere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little sweetie-pie . I knew she 'd figure it out . Did n't I say she 'd come through in the end ? Where is it ? Let 's see . ROBBIE Stand back with awe . ( Bill raises the egg slowly . He and Robbie do the " Also Sprach Zarathustra " theme from 2001. ) p. 10 SHELLY Guinevere is a genius . She definitely gets an extra cup of scratch today and I 'm going to knit her some booties . BILL BARENBERG Shelly-pie ? SHELLY I mean two years of art school and I could never do an egg like that . It 'll have to be scrambled for three ways I 'll make some bread for toast . BILL BARENBERG You 're avoiding me , Shelly-pie . SHELLY Why am I avoiding you ? BILL BARENBERG Did you slip this egg under Guinevere so I would n't chop off her head today ? Did you ? SHELLY I bet she lays an egg tomorrow . Another one . BILL BARENBERG That 's not what I asked . SHELLY How come you always think I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet baby cake . ( Bill advances on Shelly . An old game ) SHELLY Oh dear ! Help ! No , no please do n't Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! ( Bill tickles her . She shrieks , but you know ) Leave my body alone . I have a surprise . BILL BARENBERG You were a very naughty Shelly-pie , were n't you ? p. 11 SHELLY No . Yes . Yes . BILL BARENBERG Yes , what ? SHELLY Yes I was . BILL BARENBERG Yes I was what ? SHELLY Yes I was a very naughty Shelly-pie , was n't I ? Now stop it and I 'll tell you what I got . BILL BARENBERG Repeat ten times I was a very naughty Shelly-pie . SHELLY I was a very naughty Shelly-pie . I was a very naughty Shelly-pie . I was a very naughty Shelly-pie . I was a very naughty Shelly-pie . I was a very naughty Shelly-pie . I was a very naughty Shelly-pie . I was a very naughty Shelly-pie . I was a very naughty Shelly-pie . I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SHELLY I have my pride . Yikes , stop . ROBBIE Who wants a third of a scrambled egg . ( Bill and Shelly stop ) SHELLY Oh . Hi , Rob . BILL BARENBERG Rob is n't feeling all kinds of positive today . He wants it to be a bummer , so we have to do everything in our power to help him out . SHELLY ( To Robbie ) For real ? p. 12 ROBBIE I do n't know . The weather 's sort of shitty and Reilly 's coming and we do n't have a thousand dollars for a boat that keeps sinking anyway and on top of that this house is haunted by evil spirits . SHELLY Are these the reasons you 're not feeling positive ? ROBBIE I 'm horny . BILL BARENBERG Ah , that 's the reason you 're not feeling positive . ROBBIE We 're out of smokables . BILL BARENBERG Anything else ? ROBBIE And we 're a lost generation in search of meaning but unable to grasp a sense of values in a shipwrecked century . SHELLY That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's have an egg . ROBBIE Can I use your room ? SHELLY Sure . ROBBIE If the weather clears up , and a girl comes by who wants to get laid and we get our hands on some dope and Reilly decides to sell for twenty-one fifty-seven , then wake me up . ( Robbie exits ) BILL BARENBERG Bummerville , oh , bummerville . ( Hummed , that is is he 's full of shit . You know that , you know Rob . SHELLY Why ? I mean you 're probably right or wrong , but why ? You 're the man , hon , so what you say goes , but like why is he full of shit as opposed to you or me ? BILL BARENBERG He would n't give a damn if this whole fishing thing fell through . SHELLY I bet he would . BILL BARENBERG I bet he would n't . SHELLY I bet he would . BILL BARENBERG I bet he would n't . SHELLY I bet ( Bill dives for her , more tickles ) Hey , do n't . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , he is your best friend and everything . BILL BARENBERG I do n't know . I mean , our fathers were best friends maybe . They really were . That was a long time ago , and you know , once his old man started doing well he just like cut himself off . Never kept in touch with the old gang . Like he was embarrassed or something . I remember this time , my old man needed some bread and he had to ask me to ask Robbie to ask his dad absurd . He just thinks it 's all some kind of joke , this boat . Not a joke exactly . If he had to work , you know , if he could n't just drive around having a groovy time spending his old man 's money maybe I could feel , like , more trust , that 's all I mean . He 's a good guy . I dig him . p. 14 SHELLY What if it does n't work out with the boat ? BILL BARENBERG It 'll work out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't ? BILL BARENBERG Like crazy Rory says , " Wow , man , you want to get into something you like , put your energy right there and the whole thing just happens , right . " ( Pause ) It just has to work . It feels right . What can I say ? Just being out there on the ocean with no one to hassle you . No assholes trying to get rich and coming down on you ' cause you do n't want their fucking crazy trip . Just me and Rob and the fish . Us and them . And the boat . SHELLY As the sun sinks slowly in the west . BILL BARENBERG So it 's romantic . Nothing wrong with that . Nothing at all . I 'll wear a cowboy hat , so what ? SHELLY The farm was sort of romantic . BILL BARENBERG That was different . SHELLY Why ? BILL BARENBERG It just was . A farm is just a bunch of dirt and cows shitting in the fields . I 'm not a land person . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is everyone closing in on me today , I 'm a nice guy . SHELLY Hey , I was n't closing in , baby . I think it 's a fine idea . And I think it 's going to work out really good . The old Ching said , " After Initial Setbacks , Great Abundance . " p. 15 BILL BARENBERG You throw it ? SHELLY Yeah , last night . BILL BARENBERG Well , all right , all right . That 's better . In fact , that 's kind of far out . That definitely calls for an egg , and a little smokeroo . Oh , shit . SHELLY Just sometimes I do n't know I think about it . About how things do n't work out sometimes or not work out exactly more like not work out the way you want them to . Or even work out but not be what you thought they 'd be . And how you adjust . I know you have to fight . I know that . But you ought a be able to get your head into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you it 's O.K. It 's just O.K. no matter which way things go . Anyway , I know what I mean . It 's like , some people always go around looking for a beautiful place to be in and other people make whatever place they 're in beautiful . ( Bill laughs ) It 's not funny . BILL BARENBERG In case you forget , Shelly-pie , I read that book , too , and it 's not like I do n't dig Swami whatever his name is . A lot of my favorite gurus are fat little Indians but all that stuff is bullshit . SHELLY It is not . BILL BARENBERG It is too . SHELLY You do n't know what you 're talking about . p. 16 BILL BARENBERG ( Pause ) I hope we get some sun today . ( Pause . Truce ) SHELLY I got peyote . BILL BARENBERG Did you say something ? SHELLY Yup . BILL BARENBERG As in the **70;849;TOOLONG peyote ? SHELLY Cacti . Yup . BILL BARENBERG What how when where why ? SHELLY That chick that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weird lizard . She was in Safeways over by frozen foods . I was just getting milk and she came up and said , " Hey , man , I 've seen you around , you want some dynamite peyote , man , hey , man , " you know , and she handed me a bag , a hundred buttons . They picked ' em last week in Arizona " or Chicago , or something , like they grow , right . " Boy , was she out of it . And the manager guy that always tails you when you 're shopping  --  BILL BARENBERG Shit-Shoes . SHELLY Yeah , Shit-Shoes , he 's standing right at the end of the aisle and he knew what was going down and he was shitting in his shoes because if he hassled her there 'd be a big hippie-drug scandal in Safeways and you ca n't have a big hippie-drug scandal in Safeways . So I gave her ten bucks . That 's fair . p. 17 BILL BARENBERG A hundred buttons for ten bucks . That 's disbelievable . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag and shows them . ) SHELLY Did I do good , huh-huh ? BILL BARENBERG They 're fresh ! They 're not even dried . They 're juicy and green and sunkist and , Shelly , you 're a genius . I knew there was a reason I kept you around . SHELLY Aw gee . BILL BARENBERG God in his infinite wisdom and mercy has seen fit this day to lay upon us the means to get very stoned for many hours , and if I can jew Reilly down to a thousand today , I say we celebrate with a trip of unforgettable magnitude and duration . SHELLY Sounds like a good plan . BILL BARENBERG Far out ! O.K. Time for the cooking and the eating of the breakfast . What 's for food ? SHELLY Ah . That 's the hitch . See , after I gave the lizard chick the money I realized an embarrassing thing . BILL BARENBERG You silly girl . SHELLY I got milk . We can have coffee . And an egg . And milk . ( Rory enters . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeans . Soaking wet from the rain . Bottle of beer in hand . He 's drunk. ) p. 18 RORY First thing is I got ta pee and how are you and where 's the party ? SHELLY Hi , Rory , how 's tricks ? RORY Tricks is tricks and kicks is kicks and always the twain shall meet as the chipmunk said to the tractor . What ? Whew . All right . Yeah . Water . There seems to be a little water around here and most of it 's on me . Must be raining , know what I mean . The big boy is taking a pee . On you and me . And that makes three . Yessiree . How ' bout some tea ? Whew , nine o'clock A.M. in the morning and I 'm already drunk as a skunk in a bunk . BILL BARENBERG Sit down , Rory . Or kneel or something so you do n't have far to fall . RORY Right , right . ( Sits ) So how 's your ass and pass the grass . BILL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Famine in the lamine . BILL BARENBERG Do n't you have any ? RORY ( German ) Do I heff der grass geschmoken ? Nein , mein hippeez . It 's juice all the way till the end of the day , and I definitely have to do something about the urino in my bladdero . SHELLY Why do n't you go to the toilet . p. 19 RORY I like that girl , yes I do . You ought a be in the toilet business . Hey , I want you to remember something . Six-thirty . Remember that . Six-thirty . Very important time of the day . Big changes at six-thirty . SHELLY O.K. What about six-thirty , Rory ? RORY You want to know and here we go . Party-arty-o at the big house on the cemetery . SHELLY Again ? RORY Dass rhat , Missy Shelly . Got ta play de fiddle while de ciddy burns . Lotta foods gon na happen . Big salad , apple crumble , and Delores is doing this whole number with a twenty-five-pound Ling cod all wrapped up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound Ling cod ? Where the hell did you catch that ? RORY We have n't caught it yet . That happens this afternoon . Dope ? Dope ? I 'll have some grass for you a little later . I got these friends coming by from movieland said they 'd be bringing some dynamite marihootee from the land of Mehico . Mucho bene . BILL BARENBERG ( Pause ) You got any spare bread , Rory ? RORY For Reilly 's boat ? No way . BILL BARENBERG How 'd you know about that ? p. 20 RORY Reilly ai n't so wiley . Word 's out you guys want to go fishing . How the fuck you think you 're gon na keep anything from the undertaker in a town this size ? Leave the fish alone . That 's what the fish are saying . " No , no , no , you groovy dudes , do n't catch me do n't sell me . " What do you want to fish for ? I mean  --  I mean  --  I mean , go fishing . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few , eat a few . It 's fun . But , go commercial ? Leave the ocean alone . It 's having a good time . BILL BARENBERG Thanks for the help . RORY Come on , amigo , I bum you not out . O.K. , here 's the deal . Why is Reilly selling ? That 's uno . Why 's he selling so cheap ? That 's dos . And why 's he in such a hurry ? That 's trey and you 're out . BILL BARENBERG You know about something we do n't know about ? RORY Reilly 's a corpse . He can still do the boogaloo , but he 's dancing his last dance . Where does I work ? I works in the graveyard . What do I do ? I plants folks . Reilly 's wife has a little deal going and I 'll tell you about it but you never heard it , you dig ? BILL BARENBERG Are you sure about Reilly ? RORY His brain got all full of little cloteroos and one day they 're just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " ' bye-bye Reilly . And since my graves is all the rave Missus Reilly comes to me and pays me to dig a grave pre-advanso of the big day . It 's all dug . Last week . Whew . Got a piece of canvas over it keep the rain out . All he got ta do is crawl in and I dump the turf on him . And see , I do n't have a whole lotta mind to invest in a boat when I just dug a hole for the man that owned it . I ai n't superstitious , you understand , but I am superstitious . p. 21 BILL BARENBERG Fuck . RORY Heaviness . SHELLY Well , yeah , sort of , but it 's not our fault that he 's dying . We ca n't do anything about that and we could probably get him to come down a couple hundred since he has to sell . RORY You just care too much , lady , that 's your hang-up . SHELLY Someone 's gon na get the boat . And anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big a deal . People die all the time . Forget it . Bill . RORY Six-thirty . Party at the graveyard . I got ta pee , yessiree . ( Mary-Ellen and Dane stand awkwardly in the kitchen doorway . ) MARY-ELLEN Excuse me , is Rob here ? RORY Hey , you guys were driving around in a red Volvo . DANE That 's right . RORY I saw you on the way over and I thought wow , they 're lost , whew ! How the hell are you ? DANE Fine . The door was open so we just let ourselves in . RORY What 's the word on Volvos ? I been thinking of getting one . DANE We 're pretty happy with it . p. 22 RORY That 's good to know . What time is it ? SHELLY It 's nine-thirty . RORY Nine-thirty and I is smashed out of my grapefruit . Got ta get this day together . Pee first , pay later . Arriverderci . Ciao . Guten Tag and kung fu . Scusi . ( He brushes past Mary-Ellen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-five a gallon . DANE What ? Oh , yeah , we 've been doing about that . A little more on long trips . RORY Beautiful beautiful . ( He exits ) MARY-ELLEN I hope we did n't interrupt anything . I mean I hope this is the right place . SHELLY You 're friends of Rob ? MARY-ELLEN He stayed with us before he came here . We just decided to drive up . You did n't have a phone or anything . BILL BARENBERG He 's asleep . MARY-ELLEN Oh . DANE We could come back later . MARY-ELLEN Maybe we could wake him up . Could you tell him that Melon and Dane are here to see him ? BILL BARENBERG Do you guys have any dope ? p. 23 SHELLY I 'll wake him up . BILL BARENBERG I do n't think you should . The sun 's not out yet . MARY-ELLEN Is he all right ? SHELLY What do you mean ? MARY-ELLEN Rob . SHELLY You mean like is he sick or something ? DANE I guess we ought to come back later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary-Ellen , but no one 's called Mary-Ellen , right , so it 's Melon . Cute , huh ? BILL BARENBERG The thing about Rob is he 's sort of hiding for the day ' cause he 's horny and depressed and we 're out of smokes and he 's pretty sure the house is haunted . MARY-ELLEN Same old Rob . DANE Maybe I ought to bring the car around . ( Enter Robbie ) ROBBIE ( Casual ) Hi . Listen , Rory 's peeing on the side of the house  --  and it stopped raining . ( Pause ) Have a nice trip up ? MARY-ELLEN Yes , thank you , shithead . ( Mary-Ellen and Robbie bust up laughing and screaming . Dane smiles . They all hug each other . Shelly and Bill look at each other . Fade. ) p. 24 Act 1 , Scene 2 Scene 2 Front of the house , porch and yard . Lots of farm-type junk on the porch . Maybe a makeshift birdhouse on a post . Bright sunlight . Mary-Ellen is sunning herself , eyes closed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the .22 . SHELLY ( Fires ) Bull's-eye . Guess we 're about ready for the bank job . Hey , Bill , I hit three out of ten . BILL BARENBERG ( Inside ) Do n't waste bullets . SHELLY Mah man . MARY-ELLEN ( Continue ) I guess it 's just my imagination . Eight years , though , that 's a long time . And the way he 's been going around visiting all his old friends . I mean it 's great that he feels like doing that but sometimes like when he stayed with us , you could n't tell if it was more of a hello visit or a good-bye visit . SHELLY Well , if I was gon na pick someone to worry about and I never would unless I really had to it would n't be Robbie . MARY-ELLEN We 're not really worried . SHELLY Want to try a few shots ? MARY-ELLEN No , thanks , I do n't like guns . p. 25 SHELLY I did n't used to , but now I love ' em . Not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today to be handy with a rifle . I cook and sew too . I 'm sort of Renaissance-y . ( Fires ) Shit . MARY-ELLEN Do you feel anything ? SHELLY I have n't exactly seen God or anything but I had a few rushes . MARY-ELLEN I feel like I 'd sort of like to puke , but I do n't really want to do that . If I 'd already puked I 'd probably feel better than I do . SHELLY How many buttons did you take ? MARY-ELLEN Five . I 've never done peyote before . I 'm not sure what 's supposed to happen . SHELLY I had eight . I feel pretty good . MARY-ELLEN I feel pretty nauseous . SHELLY Let 's not talk about it . MARY-ELLEN I 'm sorry . SHELLY Hey , I do n't mean to be like heavy about it . I mean . Shit . ( Controlled ) I do n't like to know when people are feeling sick because that 's something they have to deal with and there 's nothing you can do about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was exactly what I wanted to say . That does n't happen a lot . ( Guinevere clucks offstage ) p. 26 MARY-ELLEN What 's that ? SHELLY ( Going around house ) I 'm coming , baby , I 'm coming . ROBBIE ( He enters ) Any reports from the land beyond the shadows ? MARY-ELLEN I do n't know about this peyote . How do you feel ? ROBBIE Fan-fuckin '  --  tastic . Look at that sun . It 's weird the way the weather keeps changing around here . God , that mountain . I 'm sure it was n't that close to us yesterday . MARY-ELLEN Rob ( Enter Shelly , with Guinevere in her arms . ) ROBBIE Any more eggs yet ? SHELLY She 's doing O.K. Do n't hassle her . She 's no good under pressure . ( To Mary-Ellen ) Have you met Guinevere ? You can hold her if you want to . MARY-ELLEN ( Backing off ) Please take her away . I 'm sorry . I just have a thing about chickens . ( Shelly goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ROBBIE Like shit in a swamp . I 'll tell you something . Peyote may turn out not to be my gateway to the beyond . p. 27 BILL BARENBERG I feel like another shit in a swamp . ROBBIE Hi there . What 's a nice shit like you doing in a swamp like this ? MARY-ELLEN Where 's Dane ? ROBBIE Dane ? Dane ? Where 'd you go , Dane ? Dane , baby , come to papa . ( Robbie looks in his shirt pocket , his pants pocket , takes off his shoe , looks there . Bill and Shelly join in . This is hysterical ) BILL BARENBERG Hey , Shelly , what 'd ya do with Dane ? SHELLY I did n't mean to eat him . I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . There was only one egg . ROBBIE Ah , come to the scenic Northwest and groove . MARY-ELLEN Has anyone seen Dane ? Sometimes he wanders . SHELLY Dane 's here . ( Dane stands in the front door holding a cutting board with buttons on it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've figured it out . We 're feeling sick because of the strychnine in these buttons . Strychnine is a convulsant and its chemical action is to make the stomach tense up . Now the other thing that happens is the actual hallucinogenic effect of the drug that 's in this stuff , and I 'm not sure what that is , but there 's a point where the curve traced by the poison and the curve traced by the high cross each other and from that point on the high is predominant . And this depends on the dose . Now there 's less strychnine than there is drug , so it stands to reason that the more you take , the less chance there is of getting sick . p. 28 ROBBIE Good thinking . DANE Yes . So what I 've done is I 've brought out more buttons . SHELLY Those are our buttons . BILL BARENBERG Cool it , Shelly . SHELLY But that 's our peyote . DANE Oh . I 'm sorry , Shelly , that did n't occur to me . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're committed to the trip we ought to try to make it as good as possible . MARY-ELLEN You want us to pay you for the extra dose ? ROBBIE Hey , what 's the matter with everyone ? Dane has had a very excellent good idea which I think we all ought a throw our support behind . O.K. ? SHELLY If I was their guest I 'd at least ask BILL BARENBERG Shut up , baby . ROBBIE It 's great how we 're all getting off on each other . If there were a few more guns in the house we could shoot it out . SHELLY Forget it . I 'm just weirded out by everyone being sick when I 'm feeling O.K. BILL BARENBERG If there were some way we could share our sickness with you we 'd do everything in our power . Do n't , baby . That 's enough . p. 29 DANE I also got ice cream , that 's the other thing . I figured part of our sickness was because of the taste of the buttons , so the ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROBBIE Yeeeech , ice cream . DANE Peppermint chip . Peppermint 's very strong . SHELLY Why do n't all you guys just have one big communal puke and get it over with ? MARY-ELLEN I hope the trip at the end of this is worth the getting there . SHELLY The trip is in your head . MARY-ELLEN Shelly , can we do something later ? SHELLY What do you mean ? MARY-ELLEN I feel there 's some kind of negative energy between us . I do n't know exactly what it is but I feel it very strongly and it 's gon na get in the way of a good event today if we do n't do something about it , and just generally , you know , bad vibes ought to be avoided because they 're an outside force and you do n't want to be controlled by an outside force . What I want to suggest is that when we 're more into the high maybe we could concentrate on finding some good energy inside of us and we could work at directing that good energy toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to refer back to that energy whenever we feel bad vibes developing between us. p. 30 DANE Mary-Ellen 's doing a lot of confrontation work . SHELLY I have n't got a single negative feeling about you . Not one . I feel completely , positively wonderful about you . MARY-ELLEN I do n't feel that 's true . ( Shelly looks helplessly at the others ) DANE Why do n't you two work that out later ? MARY-ELLEN ( Emphatically to Shelly ) All right ? SHELLY Sure . Fine . BILL BARENBERG The ice cream 's melting . ( All are glad for a chance to break and get into something physical , like eating more of the stuff that created the situation from which they were glad to break and get into something physical , like eating more of the stuff eat in relative silence . Some faces . Dane talks as he eats . ) DANE Five months ago . Less . On this mountain . Me and Mary-Ellen hiked to the top and took acid . What a strange trip that was . The sounds you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our backs . We were naked , you see . We took all our clothes off . Except our socks . Leaves . Breezes . You could hear the sun moving through the sky . Whhsssh . And roots moving through the ground under your head . Insects . Ants all over our bodies . Thousands of ants , thousands of tiny legs running all over us . I sort of freaked out . I was terrified . Mary-Ellen could n't feel them . Well , there were n't any , you see , I was just imagining it and , anyway , Mary-Ellen was dancing . But this friend of mine had told me about a time when she 'd been stoned on top of a mountain , a different mountain , and she 'd woken up with ants in her hair and her eyes and in her ears and crawling around her crotch and I just flipped out and everything in my body came out . I was urinating and defecating and crying and my nose was running and I was sweating and I felt so Christ-awful alone way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky and just a mountain underneath us , which is n't very much . Trapped in between . Mary-Ellen did n't seem to notice . She was rubbing against trees . It got better . p. 31 MARY-ELLEN I remember . I was being a grizzly bear . ROBBIE Oh , God , this ice cream , this ice cream , it 's so green and so runny and it tastes so weird . It 's like they did n't even bother to mix the chemicals together . I swear I can taste every single chemical separately . Green . Oh , I love it . It 's so Twentieth Century . I would defend this ice cream against attack . ( Shelly begins to move in a kind of rhythm , dancing to music she hears in her head , very funky . ) SHELLY Come on , baby , let 's dance . BILL BARENBERG Stop it , Shelly . SHELLY Please dance with me . BILL BARENBERG Cut it out . ( Shelly moves off and dances on her own ) DANE I 'll dance with you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROBBIE What 's the matter with you , Billy-boy ? SHELLY ( To herself ) Ohhh , it 's soooo good , it 's sooo good . ( Bill gets up , takes the rifle . Dane grabs it from him ) DANE Hey , man , take it easy . What are you doing ? ( Bill looks at him blankly ) p. 32 BILL BARENBERG I 'm going inside . How does that strike you ? ( Bill takes the rifle back and exits indoors . Immediately , Shelly goes in after him . Pause ) ROBBIE Nice to see you guys . Nice of you to drop by . DANE You have some weird friends . ROBBIE Oh , Bill 's just he 's like that sometimes . Life is a freak show , right ? DANE ( Seriously ) That depends really on how you look at it . ( Robbie bursts out laughing ) ROBBIE You 're the fucking limit . Hey , thanks for coming . ( He hugs Dane warmly . Dane returns the gesture but awkwardly ) MARY-ELLEN We missed you . ROBBIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point in time ? MARY-ELLEN Honey , why do n't you take the ice cream back before it melts ? DANE O.K. You could say leave me and Rob alone , you know . MARY-ELLEN Leave me and Robbie alone . DANE Yes . All right . I 'll be inside . ( He exits inside with the cutting board ) p. 33 ROBBIE How 'd you find out where I was ? Did I leave clues ? MARY-ELLEN Where are you going after this ? ROBBIE I have n't thought about it . Maybe I 'll stay , settle down , who knows ? Countryside , ocean , and there 's this check-out girl in Safeways . I mean , why not ? What more could a man ask for ? A wife , a life , a little bit of strife . Look , I enjoy moving around right now . O.K. ? MARY-ELLEN I do n't know . Is it ? ROBBIE Sure , the call of the highway , new horizons , adventure , old friends , laughing , good times , saying hi . MARY-ELLEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm fine . MARY-ELLEN Are you ? ROBBIE Lay off , Mary . MARY-ELLEN I realized after you left we 'd never really talked . A whole month with us and I never learned anything about you . My husband 's best friend . ROBBIE What ? Is that what he said ? I mean , sure , we went to school together but I always thought well , it was more you and me . Sort of . You know . MARY-ELLEN I know . Why did you leave so suddenly ? I was really upset . p. 34 ROBBIE Oh , I do n't know . I thought it was time to go . ( Pause ) What do you want , Mary ? MARY-ELLEN I want to know what 's going on with you . How you 're feeling . ROBBIE You came all the way up here today to find out how I was feeling ? MARY-ELLEN Just talk to me , that 's all . I 've been thinking about you . ROBBIE What if I do n't want to talk ? What if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What if I want to guard the big secret ? Stay mysterious , elusive . What would you say to that ? MARY-ELLEN I just want to be able to think about you in a certain way . I want to feel good about you . You remember the day you and me and Dane went to that park and ROBBIE No . ( Deliberate ) I do n't . Look , Mary , whatever it is we could say to each other , the thing is , afterwards you 'd go back to Dane and have dinner and talk and live your life and that 's very nice for you and Dane and I 'm very happy for both of you . And I would just move on to some place else . Which is very nice for me . But it 's different . Things are just a certain way , and the way they are is that we ca n't do anything about what both of us think it might be nice to do something about . And anyway , it would n't be very nice . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ROBBIE Oh , God , you get things so mixed up sometimes . MARY-ELLEN No I do n't . Tell me what you 're really thinking . ROBBIE I just fucking did . Tit . MARY-ELLEN What ? ROBBIE Tit . Teat . Bosom . Breast . That 's what I was really thinking , O.K. ? Being suckled at your breast . May I do that ? MARY-ELLEN Of course not . ROBBIE ( Laughing ) And you want me to trust you ? MARY-ELLEN Stop being like this , Rob . ROBBIE Like what ? I just told you exactly what was going on in my mind . I had this very simple , straightforward urge to be suckled at the breast of my best friend 's wife , in that way that friends do . End of conversation . Next question . MARY-ELLEN All right . Go ahead . ROBBIE Let 's talk about something else , Mary . MARY-ELLEN God , you 're the loneliest person I 've ever met . ROBBIE Fuck off , Mary , just fuck off . Leave me alone . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Golly . Nice sun . For a while there I did n't think it was going to come out today . ( Pause ) See , there 's no point . ( Enter Reilly from the corner . He 's about forty-five or so . He clears his throat ) Ah , Reilly , you old son of a gun , just in the nick of time . How the hell are you ? p. 36 REILLY Ca n't complain , ca n't complain . ROBBIE This is Mary-Ellen . Mary-Ellen , Reilly . MARY-ELLEN Hi . REILLY You found yourself a friend , eh ? ROBBIE Yes , yes indeed . How is the missus ? REILLY She 's well , she 's well . ROBBIE Good . I 'm glad to hear it . REILLY Yes , she 's doing fine . ROBBIE Great . Everyone 's sort of ah inside . I 'll tell them you 're here . REILLY Could I trouble you for a glass of water ? Just a glass of water , if you could manage , that is , if it 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll stay out here if it 's all right with you . Just a glass of water . ( Enter Dane ) DANE Whew , boy , I think that last batch must 've done the trick . I 'm getting incredible rushes . ROBBIE Dane , this is Reilly . He 's , ah . We 're just now in the process of . Jesus , this is pretty complicated . Inside my head , I mean . Reilly , fix on Reilly . We 're buying a boat from Reilly . Well , we 're considering . It 's a fishing boat . We 're going to fish . Commercially . Me and Bill . I did n't tell you that . This is , oh , Reilly , this is Dane . p. 37 DANE You look exactly like a picture of my grandfather . REILLY That a fact ? Well , I could do with a glass of water . I could use that . ROBBIE Sure . Whew . Some shit ! ( He exits into house ) REILLY Little something to wash down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headache . DANE You get migraines ? REILLY Could n't get far without the red ones . The green ones I do n't know . They 're supposed to make you sleep better . I just about forgotten what the hell sleep is , you know ? Oh , I take ' em , but . Total bitch this pain business . Never mind , hell , do n't you pay any attention to me . Shit , I 'm all right . I 'll be fine . Do n't believe I caught your name . DANE Dane . REILLY Dane , that 's it ! I remember now . Sure , Dane . I forgot the first time , that 's what happened . Goes in here , comes out there . ( Ear to ear ) Concentration 's shot . It 's a humiliating thing what pain does to you . When it keeps going on , I mean . Dane , that 's it , got it now . Like a Great Dane . That 's the way to remember it . Great Dane . MARY-ELLEN Look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did you bring the camera ? p. 38 DANE ( He mimes a camera ) Click , got it . MARY-ELLEN Wow , pictures . Get one with me and Reilly over by the trees . REILLY Beg your pardon ? DANE Whoops . MARY-ELLEN ( Explaining ) We just ah DANE Oh , have you met my wife Mary-Ellen ? REILLY How do you do ? Your wife . I thought you were friends with whatsit . Paul . MARY-ELLEN Rob . REILLY Oh , Christ , my head , my head . ( He presses his hands over his eyes ) MARY-ELLEN Dane , do something . He 's in pain , Dane . ( Dane giggles ) Dane ? DANE ( Laughing ) I 'm sorry , honey , I ca n't help it . It was just how you said that . I ca n't stop , I 'm sorry . ( Reilly recovers ) MARY-ELLEN Hey , are you all right ? REILLY I think it 's over . Yeah , better , better . It comes in spurts like that . Comes and goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 's the truth . Much better now , thank you . Just waiting for the water . p. 39 MARY-ELLEN ( To Dane ) You make me sick , Dane . DANE Hey-hey . I 'm sorry . I could n't control it . ( He hugs her . Mary-Ellen exits into house ) REILLY I guess we 're in for a spell of good weather . Fellow at the Coast Guard said a few weeks of sun . Warm up the water . That 's good for the silver . Yep , silvers are on top , you see , right near the surface . Fifty degrees and they bite . Funny thing about that . See , your Chinook stay right close to the bottom and your silvers stay on top . Both of ' em salmon , but I do n't suppose they ever even see each other . Figure that . You ever done any fishing there , Dane ? DANE Fish talk to each other . Each species is supposed to have its own separate language and it ca n't be understood by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even supposed to be dialects . Complete sublanguages . Like up in Manitoba there 's these bass that talk more like trout than wait , it 's not bass it 's pickerel bass or pickerel ? REILLY Oh , hell , yeah , there 's all kinds of fish , that 's true enough . Now , fish do n't feel anything , there 's an interesting fact while we 're on information . Think of that . No such thing as a migraine in a fish . ( Enter Robbie ) p. 40 ROBBIE Hey , I ca n't find them anywhere . ( Enter Bill and Shelly , in a hurry . ) BILL BARENBERG Hey , Reilly , we just saw your truck coming off the highway . SHELLY I 'll make some hibiscus tea . Would you like some tea , Reilly ? REILLY I 'll just have some water , if it 's no trouble . ROBBIE Water ! That was it . Sorry , Reilly . ( Shelly exits inside ) REILLY Just for the red pills , you see . What do you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BILL BARENBERG Sure , why not ? REILLY That 's what I like to hear . Just got a new coat of paint on her . Looks real sweet . Do n't know as I ought to sell her even . BILL BARENBERG Well , we 're definitely interested . ROBBIE We 're sort of wondering why she sank three times last winter . REILLY What 's that ? ROBBIE And why you never mentioned it . BILL BARENBERG ( To Robbie ) You fuck . REILLY Now let me tell you boys a thing or two about last winter . That boat the third time I did n't have nothing to do with it . And them first two times neither . Goddamn son of a bitch fool kid I hired to look after it . Shit , he did n't know a boat from a shoe full of snot . Hippie jackass is what he was . Up from California . Shit . I told him a thing or two . ( Reilly has another attack in his head ) Damnit to holy fuck . ( Robbie makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascination . Reilly blacks out. ) p. 41 ROBBIE He 's dead . BILL BARENBERG ( He goes over to him ) Hey , Reilly . ( He shakes him . Reilly stirs . Sits bolt upright ) REILLY Where the hell am I ? Oh . Jeeesus . How you boys doing ? Could you get me a glass of water , could you ? ( Enter Mary-Ellen with a glass of water . Shelly behind her ) MARY-ELLEN Here you are , Reilly . REILLY Ah , you 're a darling ah MARY-ELLEN Mary-Ellen . REILLY I appreciate it . ( Mary-Ellen exits inside with Shelly . Reilly takes his pills ) Ah , that 's better . That 'll do it . Yes , sir , it 's a good little boat . I started up that engine this morning and she purred like a kitten . All new valves . All new exhaust . Yeah , she 's a good boat . You boys have a good think on it and I 'll be around first thing tomorrow morning . First thing . ( Rises ) You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll tell you . I 'm not feeling too hot . No . Take it easy . ( He exits around the house ) ROBBIE You drive a hard bargain , sonny . DANE ( He has been watching from the side ) He 's in bad shape . p. 42 ROBBIE He 's gon na be stone dead a long time before we ever lay our hands on a thousand dollars . REILLY ( He reenters ) Say , ah oh , it 's in the pickup . Ca n't keep track of paper . Take it easy . ( He reexits . Bill follows . Stops ) BILL BARENBERG He 's dying . Rory 's right . The guy 's dying . He 's standing here talking to us and he 's dying . How can he do that ? ROBBIE So , what 's wrong with dying ? BILL BARENBERG No , I mean how can the guy just be walking around like that when he 's dying ? It 's fucking evil . ( Car engine starts offstage . Car leaving . ) ROBBIE What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Volvo . Should I get it ? ROBBIE Yeah , get the frisbee . DANE It 's in the Volvo . I 'll get it . ( Pause ) I 'll be right back . ( He exits ) ROBBIE Hey . BILL BARENBERG What ? ROBBIE Where 's Dane ? ( They laugh . Enter Shelly and Mary-Ellen . Mary-Ellen is laughing hysterically . She has a pot on her head like a helmet. ) p. 43 MARY-ELLEN Hey , look at me . What do I have on my head ? BILL BARENBERG A pot . MARY-ELLEN I 'm a pothead . ( All laugh hysterically . They stop . Mary-Ellen takes the pot off ) Where 's Dane ? ( Bill and Robbie bust up ) ROBBIE He 's getting the frisbee from the Volvo . MARY-ELLEN The frisbee ? Why ? ROBBIE He wanted to . BILL BARENBERG We told him it was all right . ( This is giggly . Enter Dane with the frisbee ) DANE What 's going on ? ( They laugh . Ca n't explain ) SHELLY Hey , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BILL BARENBERG I 'm not feeling nauseous anymore . ROBBIE Do you realize what this means doctor ? ALL WE 'RE STONED ROBBIE Again ! ( They all cheer . Light changes to somber , dark , to suggest a cloud passing over the sun . All stop ) MARY-ELLEN What was that ? p. 44 DANE Look . ( They all look toward the mountains ) MARY-ELLEN Holy Jesus . Look at it . ROBBIE An Indian fog . Incredible . DANE What 's an Indian fog ? ROBBIE When it comes in like that without any warning . It 's supposed to be when the gods screwed up something on earth . They roll a fog in over the mountain , then they can creep around straightening things up without anyone seeing them . That 's what the Indians said . Spooky . SHELLY That 's got ta be a miracle . Can we go to the lookout ? BILL BARENBERG Sure . DANE What 's the lookout ? SHELLY It 's this place over the ocean . It 's incredible in the fog . MARY-ELLEN Oh , wow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assent ) DANE We 'll take the Volvo . SHELLY Far out . ROBBIE ( To Bill ) You got the keys to the cycle ? BILL BARENBERG Sure . SHELLY Do n't be a party-pooper . Come in the nifty red Volvo . p. 45 ROBBIE I 'll take the cycle . BILL BARENBERG Shelly , baby , it 's cool on the cycle . MARY-ELLEN Are you sure it 's safe ? I mean , the fog . Why do n't you come in the car ? ROBBIE Jesus , would you please stop making a fuss . Give me the keys . DANE You should make up your mind if you want us to be worried about you or not . MARY-ELLEN Dane ! ROBBIE ( He does a mock baby cry ) You 're not supposed to notice that , Dane , and if you do notice it , you 're not supposed to say anything , and if you do say anything , it 's supposed to be a joke . ( He exits with keys ) BILL BARENBERG Hey , follow our lights . DANE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHELLY Hey , what happened to Reilly ? BILL BARENBERG He went home . SHELLY Well ? Are we fisherfolk ? BILL BARENBERG It 's weird . SHELLY Is everything cool ? BILL BARENBERG You mean like all around . p. 46 SHELLY Yeah . You know . BILL BARENBERG Is n't it always ? DANE ( He calls from offstage ) Hey , let 's go . SHELLY ( Imitating ) Hey , let 's go . ( They exit arm in arm ) @x " The lookout . " A ledge of rock bordered by a wire fence with a run of barbed wire on top . A lighthouse just visible at the side . Its rotating light illuminates the stage every forty-five seconds . There 's a set of binoculars on a rotating stand that you pay a dime to look through . It 's fogged in . The actors ca n't see each other more than five feet away . No special effects , just acting . Everything has a slow quality about it . They are all in a private mood , the way you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onstage . So is the cycle , a Norton Atlas , 1969 . At the start , this : Bill is looking through the binoculars . Shelly sits huddled against the fence . Mary-Ellen looks out at the ocean . Slow , distant waves , below . Robbie and Dane are conducting an experiment in visibility . Dane stands still while Robbie backs slowly away . DANE Further . Further . Further . There . ROBBIE No , I can still see you . DANE ( Peering ) Oh yes . O.K. A little more . ROBBIE ( He goes back further ) There ! I ca n't see you now . Stand still and I 'll pace it off . DANE No , you stay there . I know my shoe size exactly . p. 48 ROBBIE So do I. Nine D. DANE You have to know the inches . Mine are exactly ten and three-eights from toe to heel . ROBBIE I hope I 'm having a good time . DANE I 'm coming . ( Robbie feints back and circles around the vehicles to Shelly while Dane paces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really deceptive in the fog .

DANE ( Offstage ) Hey , Rob ! ROBBIE Over here . DANE ( Offstage ) You shithead ! ROBBIE Dane ? Dane ? Come in , Dane . I 've lost radio contact . Commander there 's something sinister about this planet . I do n't know what it is but yes , yes , I understand what it is that 's making the hair stand up straight on the back of my head , Commander the spatial relations are all wrong .

ROBBIE She 's a friend of mine . A really good friend . SHELLY I 'm trying , Rob , I really am . But she 's just one of those people that gets on my tits .

( Dane watches him , looks at the fog ) DANE The lighthouse flashes exactly once every forty-five seconds . ( Bill continues to look through the binoculars ) SHELLY What does the fog make you think of ? ROBBIE Death . SHELLY Really ? ROBBIE Yes . Or life . In that area . SHELLY I had a flash that we were on this giant movie set . The fog was just a veil , or something , and if it lifted suddenly we 'd see these banks of lights on us and movie cameras and God would be sitting in one of those chairs with his name on it , Director , Mr. God , and he 'd be yelling cut , cut , do the whole thing again . ROBBIE Oh , I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole thing ( Stopping ) Never mind . SHELLY You know , I have regular contact with the dead . BILL BARENBERG You want to have a look ? DANE I do n't understand how you can see anything in the fog . p. 52 BILL BARENBERG You have to put a dime in . ( Bill does . Dane looks ) ROBBIE No , I did n't know that . SHELLY I 've been talking to King Solomon for two years . ROBBIE How 's he doing ? SHELLY I know this sounds weird . That 's why I never tell anyone . ROBBIE Shelly ? Shelly-friend ? Shelly-Bill's-Old-Lady ? Hello ? SHELLY He 's been explaining why you should n't be afraid of death , because it does n't stop there . You keep going on to higher forms of energy , until I do n't know . I ca n't understand him when he starts that rap . But you 're not supposed to take life . It makes it harder for you to move up to the next state of energy after you die . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROBBIE Oh , that 's where . SHELLY According to him . ( Back to Dane and Bill ) DANE I ca n't see anything . BILL BARENBERG You do n't see the fog ? DANE Of course I can see the fog . BILL BARENBERG Just look at it and let the images come to you . It 's like a screen . If you do n't want to do it p. 53 DANE Oh , I see . Let me try that . ( Rob and Shelly ) SHELLY This is between us , O.K. ? ROBBIE Bill does n't know ? SHELLY I get so worried about the way he gets violent . If he 'd killed Guinevere . ROBBIE Ah . You did put the egg there . SHELLY Do n't tell him . ROBBIE He would n't kill Guinevere . SHELLY Last year , when we had the farm , he killed our cow . Shot it in the face . ROBBIE Bill did ? SHELLY He said it was n't giving enough milk . ROBBIE Oh , no wonder . SHELLY Why , what kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? SHELLY Did n't you just say oh . I 'm so stoned . I love this stuff . ROBBIE The other day I went in the bathroom right after you 'd been , there was the most amazing turd I 've ever seen lurking at the bottom of the toilet . I was just completely overcome with awe at the sight of this perfectly formed solitary turd and all I could think was , that 's Shelly for ya . Down to earth . Calm . Complete . I 'm just you asked what kind of person I thought you were . You do n't mind my talking to you like this , turd to turd . p. 54 SHELLY You want to know something amazing ? I remember that . Last week . ROBBIE Yeah . SHELLY Well . That was n't mine . It was Bill 's , and I had exactly the same thought except just the opposite . I could n't figure out how he could be so violent and have such a calm turd . I 'm not calm at all , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( She lays her head on his shoulder ) I feel sad . ROBBIE Why ? SHELLY I do n't think I 'm going to be staying with Bill . ROBBIE Shelly ? SHELLY I do n't know yet . Do n't say anything , please . ROBBIE But why ? SHELLY I ca n't help him . He wo n't let me . He 's just never gon na do anything with his life . ROBBIE I thought you guys were happy . SHELLY I love him , you see . That 's the problem . Yeah , I think that 's the trouble . ( She hears Mary-Ellen ) Shit . MARY-ELLEN ( She enters as a spaceman ) Where is everyone beep beep . ( She finds Dane ) p. 55 DANE This is incredible . You should try this , Mary-Ellen . MARY-ELLEN What do you see out there beep beep . DANE You can project perfect visual images onto the fog . There 's some chemical in this peyote that activates the optical centers or something . It 's like watching your own movie . MARY-ELLEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rob ) Hello Rob beep hello Shelly beep beep do I get on your tits Shelly ? ( Pause ) Beep . SHELLY ( She gets up suddenly ) Would you please leave me alone . MARY-ELLEN Beep beep I do not understand your request . Beep . Please go deeper . Beeper . SHELLY Because I 'm not into it , O.K. ? Do it , but leave me out . MARY-ELLEN Still not connecting . Beep . Please go deeper beeper . ( Shelly screams . This turns to a kind of hysterical laugh ) p. 56 SHELLY You 're crazy , you know that . You 're completely god-damned crazy . MARY-ELLEN I know beep beep I 've had analysis . ( Straight ) I ca n't understand why you do n't like me , Shelly . Please like me . ROBBIE Will you please like her . She 's my friend , Shelly . SHELLY ( She goes to Bill ) I want to go for a walk . BILL BARENBERG Have a nice time . SHELLY Will you come with me ? BILL BARENBERG No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ? BILL BARENBERG I do n't feel like it . DANE I 'll go for a walk with you . SHELLY I do n't want to go with you . I mean thanks , but I want to go with Bill . BILL BARENBERG And I do n't want to go . SHELLY Bill ! ! ! Who wants to go for a walk ? MARY-ELLEN Me me me me me me ( Mary-Ellen and Robbie exchange smiles ) p. 57 SHELLY Oh , fuck it . Come on , let 's go . Where are you ? ( Mary-Ellen and Shelly go for a walk ) ROBBIE ( Apart ) The fog 's getting thinner . I can see you guys ' outline . ( Bill watches Dane looking through the binoculars . A pause ) BILL BARENBERG What 's architecture like ? DANE Huh ? BILL BARENBERG You 're an architect , right ? DANE Yeah , I 'm an architect . BILL BARENBERG What 's it like ? You like it ? I mean , I bet it 's a good job , being an architect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DANE It 's O.K. In fact , I like the actual work very much , and I like the people I work with . And a lot of jobs get created as a result of the work we do , which is n't the most important thing , but it 's good to know . I guess some people do n't care so much but I really like having a good income , you know , being able to think about the future , plan things , give my kids a good education , take care of my folks when they 're older Mary-Ellen 's folks . Oh , I remember now , the really incredible thing about architecture , and I just realized this the other day , it 's something about the structures you work with , I mean the way you have to train yourself to think about your materials from the point of view of an underlying structure , it means that you 're always looking for the order behind things , and when you apply that kind of thinking to the whole world , you find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything makes more and more sense , you know , falls into certain patterns , like a sort of design that you can keep filling in as you learn things . I mean I did n't know that I 'd think about things that way when I was studying architecture . It just happened , and then the other day I realized that I 'd had a kind of perfect accident happen to me I had this work that would always illuminate things about the world for me . I do n't know , maybe a lot of people feel that way about their work . Oh , that 's not what you asked , is it ? I guess I got carried away . What did you ask ? p. 58 BILL BARENBERG Let me see your frisbee . ( Dane gives it over abstractly ) Do n't you want to play , Dane ? DANE I just want to look through here a little more . I 'll be with you in a little while . BILL BARENBERG ( He goes near Robbie ) : Hey , Cisco . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , right , sheet ! ( Spits ) BILL BARENBERG Sheet ! ( Spits ) ROBBIE ( He backs up toward the fence and holds up his pinkie ) On the pinkie ( Bill throws . The frisbee sails over the fence into the ocean ) Whoops . BILL BARENBERG Whoops ? Oh . Um . I wonder if Dane 's got another frisbee ? ( Bill and Robbie lean up against the fence looking out onto the ocean , fingers clutching the wire . ) ROBBIE Bill , Bill , we 've lost the frisbee . BILL BARENBERG Frisbee gone to Great Waters to join Father Frisbee . DANE This is just absolutely amazing . I mean , I just would n't have believed this is possible . ( Dane does n't seem to be speaking to anyone , but he 's intense ) p. 59 BILL BARENBERG You got some weird friends . ROBBIE Yeah , they kill cows and stuff . BILL BARENBERG What 's amazing , Dane ? DANE Out there . No , wait a minute . I guess I mean " in here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . ROBBIE Do you really want to go through with this boat thing ? BILL BARENBERG No , asshole . I just moved out here for my fucking health . Look , if you want out , just say and I 'll get Larry or Ed Nolin to come in with me . There 's hundreds of guys that want to have a boat . ROBBIE I just asked . BILL BARENBERG Well , I just answered . ( Robbie takes an envelope out of his pocket and hands it to Bill . Bill opens it . It 's money ) What the fuck is this ? ROBBIE It 's fifteen hundred dollars in denominations of one hundred . BILL BARENBERG Where 's this from ? ROBBIE My rich daddy . BILL BARENBERG When did this happen ? ROBBIE I 've had it for a while . I just wanted to be sure you were for real about the boat . p. 60 BILL BARENBERG Me ? What about you ? ROBBIE Well , Strictly speaking to keep the record accurate it is n't a sort of life-or-death affair for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living off Pa . In fact , I 've reached a point where I honestly get deep pleasure spending his money . Not in a bitter , spiteful , hate-filled , self-destructive way . I feel generous and wise and even helpful as I spread it around . He does n't really know how to enjoy it , and I do . And in the long run , which is the only run that counts , he 's going to die and you 're going to die and the earth is going to crumble into dust when the sun burns out , at least that 's what I 've been told , so what the fuck . And , of course , I adore the sea . BILL BARENBERG Hang on . I appreciate this , man . I really do . But why did n't you let me know you had the bread ? I mean I 've been busting my ass trying to figure out a way to get a hold of that boat and you 've been holding on to all this bread , am I for real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have n't been busting your ass , Bill . You 've been thinking about it , sure , sort of , maybe even a whole lot , sure , kind of . Listen , I like you , man , I really like you a lot , but I see you . I ca n't help it . I see the game , what you 're doing . The farm . The trucking business . The pot plantation in Brazil . What else ? A million beautiful trips , Billy . But someone or something always fucked you over . The shits out there always beat you back . Well , what happens if the great salmon enterprise fails ; some other great shit comes along and dumps on you only this time , this time you do n't get away with blaming it on everything around you . What happens if you realize the fucking up is built right into you like an extra liver , and you 're gon na have to take it with you wherever you go ? For the rest of your life ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na break you . You 're thirty , man . It 's starting to be really important . p. 61 BILL BARENBERG Well , just who the holy fuck do you think you are , all of a sudden . ROBBIE Forget about me . I 'm a rich son of a bitch with nothing to do . I drift around . I live off the friends I have . Oh , I pay , but it 's not even my money . Look , I 've seen it , Billy . I know what I am and it 's O.K. , I 'm indestructible . I live off your happiness . O.K. Your energy . I dig on the fact that things really matter to you , that you have lives . They do things . All my friends . See , I want you to do this thing , I want you to have a fleet of five hundred boats if that 's what you want and I want your life to be good and I want you to be happy with your life and your Shelly and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I did n't mean to say any of that . It 's not even true . I find most of my friends pathetic , including you . Take the fucking money . I conned it out of some weird old guy . He buys stocks in dog shit . BILL BARENBERG Rob . What 's up ? ROBBIE Take the money . I 'm just talking . That 's what I do . BILL BARENBERG ( Cheering ) We 're gon na get that fleet of five hundred boats , fuckhead , you and me . You wait and see . And one day just for the pure dumb hell of it I 'm gon na line ' em up end to end and sail around the whole fucking planet with a stereo playing rock-and-roll and I 'll be laughing so hard they 'll hear it on Mars . Put that money in your pocket . We 're going fishing . p. 62 ROBBIE I do n't trust myself with that much cash . You hold on to it . BILL BARENBERG ( Taking it ) Hey , man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly soul . ROBBIE ( Laughing ) Right , right . ( They shake . Bill whoops for joy , yells , laughs , whatever . ) BILL BARENBERG We 're going fishing , goddamn . We are going fishing . All right . Hey , Dane , you beautiful motherfucker , stoke up the Volvo , we 're buying a boat . A BOAT . A fishing boat , man . And I 'm gon na buy you two hundred and fifty new frisbees and a tank of gas and we 'll have a Chinese meal and take more buttons and holy shit , man , it 's all coming to-fucking-gether . DANE You want to go into town . ( Bill busts up at Dane 's low-key reaction ) BILL BARENBERG Oh , Dane , Dane , Dane , you 're so together . DANE You want to go right away is what I meant . BILL BARENBERG ( He gets mock calm-serious ) See , the thing is , there 's this fisherman Reilly Oh , you met him . Well , he has a boat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us into town and you get to watch us sign the papers . I got the cash right here . Fifteen hundred buckeroos. p. 63 DANE Well . We ought to get the girls . BILL BARENBERG Shelly ! Shelly-baby ! We 're buying a boat , wan na come ? DANE Mary-Ellen ! BILL BARENBERG Shelly . Mary-Ellen and Shelly . MARY-ELLEN Yoo-hoo . We 're coming , do n't go without us . ( They enter ) SHELLY They 're over here . ( During all this Robbie is climbing over the fence on the other side of the lookout ) What 's going on ? What 's this about a boat ? BILL BARENBERG Shelly-baby-pie , we 're getting us a boat . We got the money . Rob just put up fifteen hundred . He had it all along . Look . SHELLY Ahaaaa ? Cripes . That 's just oh , my God BILL BARENBERG Yeah ai n't it just ( They laugh hysterically ) MARY-ELLEN Is this for the fishing thing ? I thought both of you guys were doing it together . BILL BARENBERG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you the money ? BILL BARENBERG Why did he give me the money ? What difference does it make ? You want to hold it ? p. 64 MARY-ELLEN ( Worried ) Where 's Rob ? BILL BARENBERG He 's here . What 's the matter with you ? MARY-ELLEN ROB ? ROBBIE ! ! ( Silence ) DANE Mary-Ellen , is something the matter ? MARY-ELLEN ROB ? ROBBIE ? ? ! ! ! ( She wanders toward the fence ) ROBBIE ! ! ! ( She sees him outside the fence on the cliff , leaning out over the edge , staring down . The others follow her ) Rob . What are you doing ? Robbie ? ROBBIE ( Distant ) What ? MARY-ELLEN Come on , we 're going to town . ROBBIE The frisbee 's down there . We ought to get it . BILL BARENBERG That 's sort of a shitty idea , Rob , ' cause that 's an eighty-foot drop . ROBBIE I can throw it up . Fuck it , we 'll get a new frisbee . ( He starts climbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DANE ( Helping ) : Put your hand on my shoulder . ( Robbie jumps down to safety . Awkward pause. ) p. 65 ROBBIE Come on , let 's buy a boat . MARY-ELLEN Ca n't you wait till tomorrow with the boat ? ROBBIE Strike while the iron 's hot , that 's what I say . I always say that . Always . BILL BARENBERG I 'll follow you guys on the cycle . ROBBIE I 'll take the cycle . MARY-ELLEN Rob . SHELLY You take the cycle , Rob . We 'll meet you in town . MARY-ELLEN NO ! I mean , for Christ sakes , everyone . ROBBIE What 's the matter ? Come on , let 's go to town . BILL BARENBERG ( Hands over keys ) Meet us at Reilly 's . ROBBIE Have a nice drive . ( He exits with cycle ) MARY-ELLEN This is wrong . ( Cycle engine starting , roaring off . ) BILL BARENBERG Who was that masked man ? SHELLY Let 's buy a boat . MARY-ELLEN We should n't let him go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dane , you know him . He was going to jump . p. 66 DANE Get in the Volvo , Mary-Ellen . MARY-ELLEN Why are you ignoring me ? DANE Because there 's only two things he can do . He can either kill himself or not kill himself , and either way , I do n't care . ( Pause ) I 'm sorry . I just went to school with him . I do n't care . ( Dane gets in the car . Mary-Ellen alone . Car starts . Fade ) p. 67 Act 2 , Scene 2 Scene 2 Back to square one . The living room . Dane is asleep on the couch , his head on Mary-Ellen 's lap . Shelly is curled up on the easy chair . Rory is on a chair . Long pause . RORY Whew . The end . I 've seen a lot of dead dudes in my day but I want to tell you that dude was dead . I 'll tell you the good news , though . When it 's funeral time , they got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Saturday night at the Roxy . It 's a fucking miracle what they can do with cosmetics . Whew . Really . It 's an art . SHELLY I 've never been seen anyone dead up close like that . I mean that I knew . It 's such a waste . ( Shelly cries ) MARY-ELLEN Do you believe in God ? RORY I do , man . I believe in everything . SHELLY It 's just not the same as what you think . God , he was such a mess on the road . It did n't even look like a body . RORY Really . Death is the ultimate trip , right ? Right ! SHELLY Shut up , Rory . RORY Hey , babe , do n't back into me , like my head is there , my mouth is there . Zip zip . That 's how I am . I care . I 'm feeling all kinds of stuff . I dug him . He was a truly far-out dude . p. 68 ROBBIE ( He enters with a tray of coffee ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He sets the tray down . They help themselves ) MARY-ELLEN He 's out . ROBBIE Where 'd Bill go ? SHELLY He 's taking a walk . You should see the stars out there . It 's gon na be a really nice day . ROBBIE Do you think he 's really cut up about Reilly ? SHELLY I guess . He really dug that Reilly was a fisherman . You know . ROBBIE Yeah . RORY It 's better this way . Fffft . Out like a fuse , nothing to lose . Blood clots are a bummer . My dad cashed in on a hemorrhage . One day . Twenty-two hours . Blubbering and pissing in the sheets . Messy scene . Did n't even recognize the kid till the last minute . Weird . Weird . You know what the old fucker said to me on the way out . Big exit line . Kid , he says , how come you 're such a jerkoff ? Man , what do you say to that ? Know what I did ? Springfield General Hospital . Into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very heavy day . Oh , things can get so fucking beee-zarre . MARY-ELLEN I do n't think I like peyote . RORY Any of that shit left ? Lay some on the kid for partytime ? p. 69 SHELLY In the icebox . I 'm sorry we ca n't make it . RORY I 'm hip , I 'm hip . Be cool . Be mellow . Remember me in your dreams . Listen . We 're putting Reilly in the turf in a few days . Do n't know when yet but like he did n't have a whole lot of friends , you know ? Just Mrs. Reilly . SHELLY We 'll be there . RORY Beautiful . Beautiful . ( Pause ) It 's such a fucking shame , ai n't it ? ( Nods and exits ) ROBBIE They found his head a hundred feet away from the body . MARY-ELLEN Even the last couple of acid trips have n't been all that great . I used to get off a lot more on tripping . SHELLY Do you have any children ? MARY-ELLEN Not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's falling apart . Just in little ways , but enough so you notice it . In the thighs . Around here . It has to happen sooner or later , I guess . I 'm sorry I do n't like you more , Mary-Ellen . It 's stupid . MARY-ELLEN That 's life . ROBBIE Hey , come on , come on , let 's play a game or something . Put on some music . Play a game . Yuk it up . p. 70 SHELLY No . ROBBIE Is Dane asleep ? MARY-ELLEN Looks like it . ROBBIE Would you make sure ? I want to tell you something . MARY-ELLEN Danie . Arf-arf . Woof-woof . Frank Lloyd Wright ! ( To Robbie ) Well ? ROBBIE ( Pause ) Hey , let 's go off some place together , us three . Canada . Start a commune . MARY-ELLEN Rob . ROBBIE Up on the lookout before . When I went off on the cycle , I really did intend to as much as I ever intend anything no , more , much more I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glances ) ROBBIE Yes , I guess I knew you knew . I mean , I know you knew what I wanted you to think , but I have this way of not being serious about things and I was very serious about Was it really that obvious ? SHELLY You know it was . ROBBIE It felt so amazing in the fog . Like flying . A hundred miles an hour . One-ten . I was sort of scared for a minute but the scared went into just perfect control , perfect peace . And I thought , O.K. , do it . Just like that . Next set of headlights . I got to that uphill curve around Angel Crest , leaned into the left lane and closed my eyes . Waited . Nothing . Then this image came into my head these rocks in front of my face , right in front , and all this life clinging to them and I 'm talking to these rocks , I 'm saying , Why ? What are you doing there ? What 's the point ? What 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm really asking , I really want to know , but all I can hear is the motorcycle . All this slimy stuff is silent , it 's just there . And I suddenly realized that that silence was an answer in a way . I mean , all that stuff is holding on just to be alive , that 's all , nothing more . And that 's a reason . It 's something to know . And it 's up to me . No one 's listening . No one 's moving aside to make room , and it 's O.K. because it 's up to me . Then I felt my hands hurting and I opened my eyes and my hands were white from holding the handlebars so tight and and I felt great . I was holding on and it felt great . I wanted to shout I was so happy , I wanted to wrap my arms around the whole fucking world and kiss it . I could n't wait to see you guys again . I could n't wait to buy that boat . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oh , man , this was the really weird part . I saw all those cop cars up ahead in the fog , all the lights flashing . I knew there 'd been an accident and for a minute I thought , I really thought , Oh , shit , it 's me . I must 've already crashed and now I 'm a ghost on this motorcycle and I 'm seeing my own accident , that 's how it must work The second you die you realize how much you wanted to live and then it 's too late . Then I saw the truck all smashed up , and all I could think was , Thank fucking Christ they chose Reilly . You know , the Indian fog I must 've been really stoned but just , thank Christ it 's him and I 'm still alive . ( Pause ) Anyway , I 'm sort of glad I saw that . If you 'll pardon my being heavy for a moment . p. 71 MARY-ELLEN I guess we ought to be starting back . We have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shakes him . He sits bolt upright ) DANE Birds . Damn , it was birds . That 's why I could n't think of the kind of fish . It was birds . Bird calls . They have dialects , you see . Never mind . MARY-ELLEN We have to get going . DANE I 'm getting so inaccurate . That 's unforgivable . Birds . ( Bill enters with Guinevere , dead and plucked . ) SHELLY You did n't ! Bill , Bill , Billy , why ? BILL BARENBERG Cook it up . There 'll be enough for all of us . SHELLY You 're a bastard . And you 're a failure . And you 're pathetic . ( Shelly goes off through the kitchen door ) BILL BARENBERG Who 's hungry ? DANE What was that ? BILL BARENBERG Nothing . This used to be Guinevere . She was a game we were playing . MARY-ELLEN We have to go . Thanks . Dane has to work tomorrow . Monday . ROBBIE It 's Sunday . It 's Sunday . That 's what today is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 72 BILL BARENBERG Right . Sunday . DANE ( He rises ) Well , thank you very much . MARY-ELLEN ( She and Rob hug ) Take care of yourself . Come have a suck one day . ROBBIE ( He goes to Dane ) Thanks for dropping by . Happy building . DANE Good luck . That was excellent peyote . I enjoyed that . Say good-bye to Shelly . ( He exits with Mary-Ellen ) ROBBIE ( Spits ) Well . BILL BARENBERG Sheet . ( Spits ) Back to square one . ROBBIE What do you mean ? BILL BARENBERG Looking for another boat . ROBBIE Is n't Reilly 's still for sale ? BILL BARENBERG You got ta be kidding . That 's all I need . Ride around the high seas in a dead man 's boat . That 'd be real cute . ROBBIE I did n't know you were superstitious . BILL BARENBERG The guy 's a jinx . Look at the way he went out . His boat goes down three times at the dock and he gets splattered all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red snot in his brain and it 's so stupid . p. 73 ROBBIE Dying 's dying . BILL BARENBERG The cop told me they found Reilly 's head ROBBIE I know . BILL BARENBERG He must 've really been traveling . ROBBIE I guess . BILL BARENBERG It 's weird . You 'd think he 'd 've slowed down if he blacked out . Do n't your muscles relax and you go limp . ROBBIE If Dane were here we could find out for sure . BILL BARENBERG Holy shit . That beautiful old fart . You know what that means ? ROBBIE It means he 's dead . BILL BARENBERG It means he killed himself . He went out on the highway and deliberately offed himself . He could n't take the idea of walking around looking like such a mess , so he did it himself . ROBBIE What difference does it make ? BILL BARENBERG Oh , asshole , ca n't you see anything ? You think lying around in a hospital full of pills and rubber tubes and stink everywhere you think that 's the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , what he did . We got ta have that boat , man . We got ta . ROBBIE Bill p. 74 BILL BARENBERG Do n't sit there all calm on me , Robbie-boy . I ca n't spell this out in black and white but I know what I 'm saying and I know it 's right just the way I know everything is full of shit most of the time and I do n't know why it 's full of shit and I ca n't write a book about it for you but it 's all gray everything in the middle everyone 's under shadows , under rocks like a bunch of moles and all this totally ridiculous stuff keeps happening to them and they just take it and take it and take it and never raise a stink , never fight back and Reilly did it . He saw what was coming and he said , No , man , fuck this , I do n't have to swallow this last piece of shit , do n't say anything ( Bill in a rage kicks the couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guinevere apart . Robbie rises calmly , goes to him and starts fighting mechanically . It 's a long , awful ritual . Robbie finally pins him . Bill lies panting ) ROBBIE Another day , another trip . BILL BARENBERG Oh , man , what the fuck is wrong with me ? How come you 're always so calm ? ROBBIE Good toilet training and a happy youth . BILL BARENBERG A lot of the time I feel like busting your head open . ROBBIE I still would n't lay any eggs . p. 75 BILL BARENBERG What ? Oh . You ever had chicken stew ? ROBBIE Dane 's building a city . My buddy . Dane . A whole new city someplace . Bolivia . Peru . One of those places . If his idea is accepted there 'll be this whole new city someplace with people living their lives in it and he designed it . Dane . The frisbee champion of my high school . BILL BARENBERG Dane 's an asshole . ROBBIE Yeah . BILL BARENBERG He 's O.K. ROBBIE Yeah . BILL BARENBERG Fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROBBIE Yeah . BILL BARENBERG I mean , I 've never even been on a boat before . What if we get seasick ? What if we sink ? What if we ca n't make a living ? I mean , I ca n't . What if you decide to take your money back . ROBBIE I wo n't . BILL BARENBERG You gon na stay out here ? ROBBIE Yeah . BILL BARENBERG And fish . ROBBIE Sure . BILL BARENBERG Why ? ROBBIE ' Cause it 's something to do . Oh , you 're right , it 's a dumb idea , no doubt about it . You and me . Two of the finest minds of our generation . But it 's something to do . And , you know , if we approach it just the right way , after a while , if we manage to stick to it , and we do n't get seasick and we do catch fish we might find there 's a good reason for doing it . p. 76 BILL BARENBERG You 're serious , right ? ROBBIE I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BILL BARENBERG Yeah , and fuck you , too , man . I can do it on my own , you know . I do n't need your help . ROBBIE I know . ( Shelly enters . ) SHELLY Give me Guinevere . I 'll cook her . BILL BARENBERG Shelly-baby . SHELLY Do n't talk to me . I 'm tired and I 'm upset . BILL BARENBERG I 'm sorry . SHELLY I do n't care . ( Shelly exits with pieces of Guinevere . Bill starts after her , stops , caught between her and Robbie ) BILL BARENBERG ( To Robbie ) Ugh-oh . ( He exits ) ( Robbie looks around for a moment , takes the .22 rifle , opens front door , aims at target outside , and fires . Brief pause . Bill rushes in , alarmed . ) BILL BARENBERG What the fuck are you doing , man ? ROBBIE Bull's-eye . BILL BARENBERG ( Covering ) Do n't waste bullets , they 're expensive . p. 77 ROBBIE Whatever you say , Billy-boy . BILL BARENBERG ( He smiles suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning . ROBBIE I think maybe after the funeral . BILL BARENBERG Right . Right . ( Pause ) Sheeeeit . ( Fake spit ) ROBBIE Sheeeit . ( Fake spit ) ( Bill exits back into kitchen . Robbie sets down rifle , takes up fishing rod and exits . We watch the room for a moment . Blackout. )
