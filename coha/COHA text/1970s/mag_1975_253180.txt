The bathroom is the most important room in any house . It is the one place where people can be nude , solitary and mute for any protracted period . It is a refuge for all reasons , serving also as laundry room , solarium , greenhouse and primping parlor , a place for delousing pets , deep thinking and stashing wet umbrellas . Yet even in its more basic functions , the contemporary American bathroom is " hopelessly antiquated and inadequate , " in the view of Alexander Kira , an architect and Cornell professor who has immersed himself in the subject for 17 years . Indeed , he points out , the Western loo has changed little since the late 19th century , when Thomas Crapper of London patented his flush toilet-and thereby insinuated himself into colloquial English . <P> In The Bathroom ( Viking ) , a newly updated and expanded version of an urbane study he published in 1966 , Kira argues that the standard bathroom is uncomfortable , unsanitary and unsafe . The average 5-ft. by 7-ft. model is badly lit and ventilated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the tubes , jars , bottles , blades , brushes and electrical appliances that have become the indispensable artifacts of ablution . Clearly , if cleanliness is next to godliness , it is also next to impossible in bathrooms that lack " facilities for perineal hygiene , " meaning bidets . Moreover , some 275,000 people in the U.S. are injured each year while using ill-designed tubs and showers . <P> Wider Seat . Kira concludes from continuing research that the standard toilet is " the most ill-suited fixture ever designed , " whether for comfort or efficient elimination . The whatchamacallit should be from 5 in. to 9 in. lower and shaped so that the occupant could take the natural squatting position of primitive man ; it should also have a wider padded seat and incorporate two water jets for cleansing . Many washbasins , he finds , are built " so low as to be ideal only for small children . " He proposes a contoured bowl , 36 in. high , deep at one end , wide and shallow at the other , with a fountain spout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The most frustrating fixture of all , in Kira 's view , is the tub-shower . " The only substantive reason for taking a tub bath is to relax , " he maintains , " and yet it is precisely this that the vast majority of tubs have not permitted the user to do . " The tub should be longer ( 6 ft. , v. the standard 5 ft. ) and wider , have a contoured back to fit the curvature of the spine , a comfortable place to sit while foot washing and shampooing , and a hand spray for rinsing . Showers should be larger , have continuous wrap-around grab-bars and different-shaped handles located away from the water source so that the soap-blinded bather can adjust water temperatures by feel . <P> Why do we have such minimal , dismal bathrooms ? Mainly , Kira contends , because we " have allowed our taboos and guilts to interfere with the fullest development and realization of our physical and mental well-being . " Builders , eager to skimp on space , seldom conceive of the bathroom as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
