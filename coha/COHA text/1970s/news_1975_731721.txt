txt The nursing home scandal poses two stern tests for Governor Carey . The first is whether he can set in motion an effective , credible and thorough investigation of the problem and the second is whether he can turn this wretched system around so that it serves the citizens of the State of New York rather than a tight circle of selfish , callous traders in human misery . The basic problem is that mysterious interventions by powerful people always seem to hamper the work of honest public servants who are laboring to protect the helpless elderly . Until recently , however , it has been a case of " look , Ma , no hands , " as the air fills with denials of political influence and involvement . A number of recent revelations have begun to flesh out the structure of the problem . One incident  --  the application for a license for the Park Crescent Nursing Home  --  demonstrates graphically its depth and extent . State officials , concerned about allegations such as " incontinent patients , dirty bathrooms and kitchens , cockroaches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bernard Bergman 's operations , were moving with justifiable caution on his application to open a new home . Despite these indications that Mr. Bergman might not have the best interests of the old people at heart , there were plenty of officials eager to vouch for his good character . Thus , Dr. Alfred Fleck , First Deputy Health Commissioner , wrote an associate , " Apparently Attorney General Lefkowitz , Assemblyman Steingut and Assemblyman Blumenthal are all very interested in Mr. Bergman 's operation . They believe he is a very fine gentleman , and think his application should be approved . " And so it was , never mind the cockroaches . Stanley Steingut , who hopes tonight to become the second most powerful politician in the state as Speaker of the Assembly , has tried hard to project a sense of distance between himself and Mr. Bergman , but somehow funds just seemed naturally to flow from Mr. Bergman to Mr. Steingut . Mr. Steingut did insurance business ( which he now abjures ) with some of Mr. Bergman 's nursing homes and at least $4,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One Bergman nursing home contributed $500 to a campaign fund Mr. Steingut controlled and then applied to the state for reimbursement on the ground that the money , had been a legal fee . And then there is the Attorney General , who seems to be a good old friend of Mr. Bergman and who somehow has n't yet been able to crack down on any of the fraud cases growing out of the industry that have come to the attention of his office . Mr. Lefkowitz is now promising a vigorous grand jury investigation of the whole matter . What the people of the State of New York appear to be facing is a severe and ugly case of money and influence and cronyism in politics , with the state 's aged suffering shamefully and the state 's taxpayers being bilked . What the state needs is a credible investigation by a special prosecutor of unquestioned integrity who has absolute independence . What it does n't need is a Speaker who has failed to explain satisfactorily his connections . Governor Carey 's reported intention to recommend Morris B. Abram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers the first solid hope of a thorough clean-up .
