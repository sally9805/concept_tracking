NEXT STOP , GREENWICH VILLAGE <P> Directed and Written by PAUL MAZURSKY <P> It is 1953 and time for a change . Larry Lapinsky ( Lenny Baker ) , 22 and just finished school , pulls up stakes . He shakes hands with Dad ( Mike Kellin ) , kisses a resentful , concerned Mom ( Shelley Winters ) and leaves their small Brooklyn apartment for even smaller and certainly colder quarters in Greenwich Village . Larry wants to be an actor , and his departure is his first full step into la vie bohme . He dares not put on his beret , however , until he is safely on the subway . <P> Fond , canny , breakaway funny , Paul Mazursky 's Next Stop , Greenwich Village is a comic reminiscence about salad days around Washington Square , the tough lessons and small victories that mark the end of growing up . What is best about Mazursky 's work ( Alex in Wonderland , Blume in Love , Harry and Tonto ) comes from his affectionate kind of satire , always clear-eyed and almost never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perhaps the most closely autobiographical of all his movies . Like Larry , he was a scuffling New York actor ( he showed up as one of the leads in Fear and Desire , Stanley Kubrick 's first feature in 1953 ) . <P> Larry has a girl named Sarah ( Ellen Greene ) , who hangs around the Village smoking English Ovals and discussing her diaphragm . She always seems to be auditioning a freshly patented attitude of weary contempt toward matters of heart and head . After making love , Sarah tells Larry , " You were fine , " sounding as personal as a weather report . Such an attitude generally passes for existential weariness , and indeed serious issues weigh heavily . " I think about suicide once or twice a day , " Larry confides . " That 's normal , " Sarah counsels him . " Suicide makes you feel talented . " <P> Fizzled Poseurs . Larry and Sarah 's friends have a nodding acquaintance with both self-destruction and self-fulfillment . Robert ( Christopher Walken ) writes plays , lives off women ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plays nursemaid to her black gay pal Bernstein Chandler ( Antonio Fargas ) , who claims his mother named him after the Jewish family for whom she worked 30 years as a maid . All of them keep an eye on the fragile , mad-eyed actress Anita ( Lois Smith ) , who periodically attempts suicide . <P> The film is filled with familiar presences-the overbearing Jewish mother , the fizzled poseurs and intrepid novitiates of Greenwich Village . But Mazursky places his characters in situations where nuance , not novelty , makes the scene ring true . When Mrs. Lapinsky shows up at Larry 's apartment with a couple of shopping bags full of food , the vignette seems at first too recognizable . Any mother would bring along a chicken . But only Mrs. Lapinsky would present it snuggled in a pot , surrounded with potatoes and vegetables all cleaned and carefully cut , ready for the front burner . The scene becomes a classic car toon with a new caption .                 @ @ @ @
