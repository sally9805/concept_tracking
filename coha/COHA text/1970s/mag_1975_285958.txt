About the only good to come out'of the nation 's most brutal postwar recession has been the decisive slowdown in inflation . The surge in living costs has slackened from a peak annual rate of 13.6% in the three months ended last October to 5% in the three months ended in May . During the past two weeks , though , a freshet of price increases , actual or contemplated , on aluminum , autos , gasoline and sugar , has aroused some worry about whether the progress can be sustained . Then , rumors of a new Soviet purchase of U.S. grain revived memories of the massive-and inflationary-1972 Russian deal and temporarily caused futures prices of some grains to jump . At week 's end it was revealed that discussions are indeed under way . President Ford insisted that the Administration is alert to the dangers of too big a sale overseas but also said , " We hope that there will be a sale to the Soviet Union . " <P> Few , if any , experts expect these developments to trigger a renewed burst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rises may presage a move by some companies to seize on the first fragile signs of a rebound , to raise their prices . Any such trend , warns Albert Rees , director of the Council on Wage and Price Stability , would " retard the recovery very severely " by discouraging consumer buying . <P> Thus Rees moved swiftly to head off a series of price boosts announced by the highly concentrated aluminum industry . Alcoa , for example , proposed an average 2.3% Increase on 60% of its shipments-although its mills are operating at only 74% of capacity and inventories of unsold metal are large . Aluminum companies argue that they have to recover higher operating costs ( Jamaica , a prime source of the raw material bauxite , has raised the price more than 700% in the past year ) and that anyway , low prices do not move metal in the face of still weak demand . Though the council has no authority to order price boosts stopped , and must rely solely on public-opinion pressure , Rees persuaded Alcoa , Reynolds and Kaiser ( which led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold a public hearing July 22 to determine if the boosts are justified . <P> That move did not dissuade automakers from planning price rises on the 1976 models due in dealers ' showrooms in the fall . Last week General Motors notified dealers by letter that the increase would not exceed 6%-thus in effect putting a tentative figure on the rises that all automakers have been talking about as necessary to recoup rising costs of materials and labor . A 6% increase would amount to $335 per car ; added to average rises of $1,000 per car over the past two model years , it surely would not help lift auto sales out of the doldrums .
