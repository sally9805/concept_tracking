FOR the professional artist in America , the chain of denial traditionally began with rejection by art schools , extended to the awarding of fellowships , and was completed by the indifference of prominent U.S. museums . Most institutions , forbidden by law or custom to keep race records , can not offer firm figures , but here are their best estimates of the present situation . <P> SCHOOLS . New York 's Art Students League today has about 200 black students in a student body of nearly 2,000 ; the Chicago Art Institute has 72 out of 650 ; and Los Angeles ' Chouinard Art School 22 out of 365 . <P> FELLOWSHIPS . The National Endowment for the Arts has awarded about 25 grants to blacks out of 186 . Since 1952 , about 35 blacks received Fulbright scholarships in the arts out of a total of 968 . One bright spot was the Opportunity Fellowships granted in art by the John Hay Whitney Foundation , set up specifically to help disadvantaged students . Out of 74 awarded , 32 went to blacks . <P> PERMANENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists out of 1,200 Americans overall , the National Collection of Fine Arts eleven out of 1,599 , the Museum of Modern Art twelve out of some 450 , the Whitney Museum 15 out of 1,100 . With no figures at hand , the National Gallery of Art in Washington could recall only three , and the Art Institute of Chicago only two .
