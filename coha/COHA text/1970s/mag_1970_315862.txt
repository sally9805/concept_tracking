What color is Santa Claus ? Some U.S. department stores are installing black Santas for their black customers . In Detroit 's J.L. Hudson emporium , mothers and children have their choice of lining up for eight white Santas or two black Santas . But 75% of the blacks have chosen the white Santas . It is perhaps sad to impose racial politics upon the mythologies of children , but the reasons for the choices are intriguing . The simplest explanation may be that children have almost always seen only white Santas , thus the black man looks odd in the role . But maybe some of the black mothers are making a deliberate choice . Department store Santas ca n't deliver the goods , of course , only promises , promises . It may be that some mothers prefer to have such gentle hypocrisy emanating from a white Santa Claus .
