txt How to keep rural youths " down on the farm " was the theme of a popular post-World War I song . More than a ditty , it expressed a deep concern that grew in succeeding decades as the exodus from country to city mounted . Between 1940 and 1970 , 28.5 million Americans left the farm , lured by the promise of shorter hours and higher pay in factories and offices . But times are changing . In the 12-month period ending April , 1972 , tide of migration from the countryside was checked . In fact , the flow reversed itself as farming recorded a new gain of 156,000 Americans . The reason ? There 's less toil and more money on the farm these days . And country youths are getting the message . So are their city cousins . One sign there is substance to the shift : Students are pounding on the doors of schools of agriculture . During the 10-year period ending last fall , enrollment in agricultural studies more than doubled , according to the National Association of State Universities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the past two years , reports Dean Orville Bentley of the School of Agriculture at the University of Illinois . Enrollment here jumped 14 and 15 percent , respectively , after modest annual increases in previous years . Another critical point : More of these students are returning to the land . Dean Bentley points out that among last year 's graduates of his school , 35 percent went into farming . // * Youths beat path to farms // That 's at least triple the figure of a few years ago , when little more than 10 percent of grads could be expected to trek back to the countryside . " Rural youths used to come to college for upward mobility , to get away from farming , " Dean Bentley emphasizes . Now it 's turning around . " Why the switch ? " Students look at the practical side of things , " the dean explains with a reference to wheat at $5 a bushel . " Farm prices are one big inducement . " There can be little doubt that the world food shortage , U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and produce prices are luring students into " ag " schools . But that 's far from the whole story . The schools teach more than farming . Landscape architecture " Half of our curriculum did n't exist 10 or 15 years ago , " says Louis Thompson of the College of Agriculture at Iowa State . This Is true elsewhere , too , where community development , re c rea tion-resou me management , wood utilization , and turf management have been added Landscape architecture is uspe ? cially popular at the University of Wisconsin 's College of Agriculture . Land-use planning is corning into its own in some schools . And Dean Bentley names forestry and ornamental horticulture as strong attractions at the University of Illinois . Job prospects in these fields are excellent , Dean Bentley reports , with the exception of forestry , which is temporarily depressed because the U. S. Forest Service has cut back on hiring . But grain merchants , food processors , fertilizer firms , feed dealers , farm-credit concerns , and similar organizations on the periphery of farming are fast expanding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry often come away empty-handed in the competition for grads . Chicago represented So appealing are " ag " school studies that urban youths have joined the rush to sign up . In fact , they account for a good pas t of the bulge in enrollments . Women are better represented too , from both farm and city . They totaled 23 percent of University of Illionis 's " ag " school students last year , apart from home economics major : ,
