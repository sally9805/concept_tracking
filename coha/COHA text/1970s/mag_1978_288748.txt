He is not yet 36 , looks ten years younger , and would seem quite at home shooting the breeze with some economics professor at a Harvard graduate seminar . That is a serious problem for Barry Bosworth , director of President Carter 's Council on Wage and Price Stability ( COWPS ) . Middle-aged business leaders take one look at him and wonder whether he is old enough for even a one-martini lunch . They need not worry . For one thing , Bosworth is a seasoned economist ( a year on the staff of Lyndon Johnson 's Council of Economic Advisers and six years with the Brookings Institution ) . More important , he is also the man most responsible for getting the White House moving on anti-inflation policy . The surprising thing is that as director of COWPS since last summer , he has done it from a position of no statutory policymaking power at all . <P> Ever since it was set up by Gerald Ford in 1974 , COWPS has been something of a no-account backwater in the Washington bureaucracy . Its role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities of industry and the spending programs of Government . When either area shows signs of adding to inflation , COWPS can do little more than send a memo to the White House and hope that someone will read it . Under Bosworth , the council 's formal powers remain negligible but the new director has infused COWPS with a sense of urgency it never had before . <P> Scarcely a week goes by without a new Bosworth inflation alert landing on the President 's desk . His memos have attacked the nation 's doctors for raising their fees 50% more than the increase in the cost of living last year . He has accused farmers of asking for crop subsidies that might create double-digit food inflation next year . He has criticized Congress-and indirectly even the White House-for appearing to cave in to the farmers ' demands . Bosworth has also become an effective jaw-boner . Two weeks ago . he masterminded the Administration 's successful effort to prevent the nation 's steelmakers from following U.S. Steel in its attempt to raise prices far beyond what would have been justified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactic-phoning U.S. Steel 's competitors and persuading them to announce smaller increases-forced U.S. Steel to roll back its own hike . Bosworth 's 20 COWPS officials have now begun gathering cost data to give the council a clear picture of just how much prices can be hiked by any major industry without speeding up inflation . <P> Married and the father of two sons , aged nine and five , Bosworth used to devote himself to hobbies of woodworking and making hand crafted stained glass . He gets little time for those pastimes these days ; most often he is seen heading home from his office weighed down with stacks of inflation statistics . He sees voluntary wage-price restraint by unions and management as the only way to check inflation . But he thinks that there is no chance to get that cooperation unless the Government sets a convincing example . Says Bosworth : " If you 're going to harangue others to show restraint , you first must show restraint yourself . This Government must first clean its own hands . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
