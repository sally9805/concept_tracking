Even before the University of Hawaii 's season-opening football game with Texas A. &; I. last week , there had been a show of another kind of power and agility at the state 's new $30 million Aloha Stadium in Honolulu . Two weeks ago , four of the stadium 's six huge , 147-ft. - high grandstand sections were swung closer to the playing field . That maneuver marked the final successful test of the revolutionary 50,000-seat stadium , which uses advanced technology to change its shape and purpose by literally sliding on a cushion of air . <P> When sports-happy Hawaiians began planning a new stadium in Honolulu eight years ago , they wanted an all-purpose arena that would serve equally well for football and baseball , a neat trick never satisfactorily performed . For example , when stadiums basically designed for football are also used for baseball , the outfield is likely to be so shallow that even weak hitters tend to turn into Hank Aarons . Charles Luckman Associates , the big Los Angeles architectural firm , decided on a novel approach : they designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed positions at the north and south ends of the field ; the four other sections , paired on the east and west sides , were to be moved around as events required . The two pairs of east-west stands would be pulled in close to the playing field to frame the classic football grid , or pushed back and angled away to form a baseball diamond . The stands would also be reconfigured for concerts or other events . <P> But how to move the massive structures , each of which would be as high as a 14-story building and weigh 1,750 tons ? After looking at a variety of techniques , the Luckman designers , collaborating with Rolair Systems , Inc. of Santa Barbara , Calif , found the answer in air-film technology . Already used by Boeing to move heavy airframes about and by San Francisco 's Bay Area Rapid Transit system to swing subway cars around at terminals , this new technology allows large , bulky objects to be maneuvered on so-called air bearings-thin ( .031 in. ) , porous plastic disks . When air is forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ builds up underneath them in a thin film that acts as a bearing . In the Rolair-designed system at the Aloha Stadium , 416 such air bearings are positioned under the four movable stands . They are linked by pipe to three large compressors . When the compressors are turned on , the bearings lift the stands up about .004 in. above a smooth concrete surface . That is enough to reduce friction sufficiently so that the stands can be moved along by hydraulic jacks a distance of 180 ft. in only 20 or 25 minutes . <P> In fact , says Luckman 's project chief , Samuel M. Burnett Jr. , the stands can be maneuvered by muscle power alone . All it could take to prepare the stadium for baseball next spring is some season-end shoving by the football team .
