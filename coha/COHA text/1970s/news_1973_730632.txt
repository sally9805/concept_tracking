txt In rubber-band stacks atop a desk in the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare ( HEW ) sit some 350 requests from schools across the country for loan of a certain film . Ordinarily , compliance would be a mere mechanical matter . In this case , the requests concern the film version of the controversial report of the Presidential Commission on Population Growth and the American Future ? and the decision to go ahead or halt the film 's distribution has escalated to the office of HEW Secretary Elliot L. Richardson . // Vopulation film fit for classroom ? // He is expected to hand down the edict very shortly . If it is " no , " the government will be accused by some of out-of-order censorship . If it is " yes , " others will accuse the govern . ment of firm sponsorship of controversial report recommendations . Over the years , presidential-commission reports have gained a national reputation for dust-gathering and lack of implementation . Noteworthy exceptions include the report of mental retardation drawn up for the late President Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particularly strong personal interest . The report on " Population and the American Future , " prepared for President Nixon over a two-year period by a 24-man commis sion headed by John D. Rockefeller III , was issued in full last spring . President Nixon accepted it and singled out ' two of its most controversial recommendations for his only comments . These included the suggestion that state abortion ' laws be liberalized to allow a woman the choice not to have an unwanted child ( though not advising abortion as a method of population control ) and the recommendation that existing legal obstructions to teen-age access to contraceptives be removed . The President made it clear his personal views were not compatible with these . While the written version of the report is available from the Government Printing Office to anyone with $1.75 , the film version , a first in the history of presidential-commis sion reports , may well never see the light of any of the nation 's classrooms as it now appears . No repeats scheduled Authorized by the commissioners , produced by Population Education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown once in late November on public television and is not now scheduled for any repeat performance . Washington Post TV reporter John Carmody at the time wrote that the approach was one of fairness and good taste ? " a more balanced , low-key report of a potentially catastrophic problem ( population growth ) could n't be imagined . . . . Birth control and sex education have seldom received a calmer advocacy . " It was a similar assessment of balance and the fact that the commission considers the film as much the official version of the report as the written account which prompted Dr. Louis M. Hellman , deputy assistant secretary for population affairs at HEW , and Sidney Marland , commissioner of the Office of Education , to reach the technical decision late in 1972 making the film available on loan to school requesting it . Plans in limbo They set aside $170,000 to buy 100 copies of the film and supplement it with well-prepared teaching materials . Distribution was to get under way in January , but the letters poured in and the controversy stoked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In addition to the 350 requests , HEW 's Office of Population Affairs has some 275 opinionated letters in hand , now running 3 to 1 in favor of distribution . Dr. Hellman , a medical doctor who has seen the film four times and considers it a " thought-provoking educational document , " concedes ' " we 're going to be a little red-faced " if a permanent halt is ordered on distribution . In his view , if a teacher happens to think the filmed report is less than balanced , she could easily compensate for any gaps during the discussion period . He adds that the legislation directing the commission in its task mentioned the importance of getting its findings to " the people " as well as to the government , and in Dr. Hellman 's view the commission was simply taking its " mandate " seriously in making the film . In one sense the fact that population-growth rates in this country have recently tapered off to roughly 2.1 children per family , or what is considered the replacement level , defuses the urgency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the opposition to the film report 's release . " I think the U.S. is lucky , " says Dr. Hellman . " We 're probably going to be able to solve our population problems voluntarily . "
