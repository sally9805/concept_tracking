txt For the voters of Tennessee , a coonskin cap symbolized the late Senator Estes Kefauver , and a piece of fried chicken symbolizes John Jay Hooker Jr . Which may be a source of trouble for John Jay Hooker Jr . Mr. Hooker is a tall , darkhaired Nashville lawyer , 39 years old , with that kind of easy charm that marks him as a member of the Southern aristocracy . He was a friend of both John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy , and in 1966 he ran for Governor. ? He was beaten by Buford Ellington ( either Mr. Ellington or his political partner , the late Frank G. Clement , has been Governor of Tennessee since 1953 ) , but he got 47 per cent of the vote and hopes to do better than that in his second gubernatorial effort this year . With his sights set on 1970 , Mr. Hooker and his younger brother , Henry , went into the franchising business in 1967 , and they did so well for them- , selves and their friends that they became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But now the stock in their ventures has slumped , many , not-so-rich people have lost money , the Hookers are under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission , and Mr. Hooker this week was called before a Senate investigating committee along with other leaders in the controversial franchising industry . For a while , Mr. Hooker semed a political sure thing , but now many Tennesseans are wondering . The Hookers ' gimmick was fried chicken stores to compete with the fantastically successful Colonel Sanders ' Kentucky Fried Chicken . They organized a web of companies to move as quickly as possible into markets across the country . As a symbol , they chose Minnie Pearl ( real name : Mrs. Henry Cannon ) , the dowdy comedienne , famous for absurdly festooned hats . Minnie Pearl , whose mythical hometown is a hamlet called " Grinder 's Switch , Tenn. , " has for many years been a star of the Grand Ole Opry , which is broadcast from Nashville to millions of country-music fans , who presumably constitute a prime market for carry-out Southern fried chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers allowed friends and acquain ances to buy stock at 50 cen a share . The list of 106 origin purchasers reads like a roll the Nashville establishment , a though it also includes famil servants , secretaries and smal time politicians who helped i the 1966 campaign . John L. Seigenthaler an Amon Evans , then and no the editor and publishe of the influential Nashvill Tennessean , are on the list . S is Doug Dickey , the former Uni versity of Tennessee footbal coach . So are the two Nash ville-area Congressmen , Rich and H. Fulton and William R Anderson ( who was the skippe of the submarine Nautilus on its first voyage under the North Pole ) , and two Federal judges William E. Miller and Frank Gray Jr . A Problem Presented The judges ' stockholding have presented a problem . A year ago , for example , both Judge Miller and Judge Gray n had to disqualify themselves i ro a proceeding for a temporary injunction against Minnie Pearl The case was eventually as signed to a Memphis judge . Judge Miller was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon last week nominated G. Harrold Carswell of Florida . But Washington sources said that ' his age ( he is 61 years old ) finally eliminated him from consideration , not his Minnie Pearl shareholdings . After a public offering of stock in May , 1968 , Minnie Pearl 's Chicken System , Inc. , caught the speculative fancy of Wall Street . Within six months , the shares were selling above $60 , even though only five chicken stands had been built by the time the stock went onto the market . Anyone who had invested $5,000 in 50-cent shares was in a position to sell out for half a million dollars , and many of Nashville 's most prominent citizens did precisely that . The Hookers also made big money for J. G. Stahlman , the publisher of The Nashville Banner , and for Governor Ellington in another of their ventures . But many less prominent Tennesseeans invested in the stock at $30 or $40 a share , and as it began its long slide they began losing money and losing affection for the Hookers and their money-making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Inc. , closed on the over-the-counter market Friday at 218 bid ; allowing for a three-to-one split , they are thus worth less than $9 , compared with the offering price of $20 . " For a long time , " said one Nashville lawyer , " people around here went kind of nuts . The word would spread that the Hookers were buying stock , and everyone else would buy , too . A lot of people took a beating , and they 're not happy about it . " One of Mr. Hooker 's prouable opponents for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination this year , Joe Carr , the Secretary of State , said in an interview this week ; " Hooker 's performance as a businessman will be a big issue . " The prospectus under which the stock was sold promised no pie-in-the-sky . . A line in boldfaced type on the front cover proclaimed , " These are speculative securities . " It discussed in considerable candor the organizers ' lack of business experience , the intensity of competition , the fact that nearly all revenues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations , and the Hookers ' own interest in other companies formed to buy franchises . In the 18 months since the prospectus was written , the last two points have generated considerable controversy , both in Nashville and in Washington . Like other franchise operators , Minnie Pearl followed the standard practice of lumping together as current revenue the sales by established stores , cash received from sales of franchises and promissory notes for the payment of balances due on the sales of franchises . Income in 1968 Thus , in 1968 , on total revenues of ** Performance Systems had only $144 , - 810 in income from chicken sales . More than $8-million of the total was represented by promissory notes . To those who did not bother to read anything more than the total figure , some critics have argued , this could be misleading , particularly since the possibility of selling more franchises gradually diminishes as exclusive contracts are signed for the various parts of the country . But neither the accounting profession nor the Government has yet made clear whether they favor a modification of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their law partners and other associates began organizing companies to buy franchises . Operating under such names as Whale , Inc. , West American Foods and ServeQuik , these companies were granted exclusive franchises . But the increasingly tight money market caused serious problems for the young promoters . Without ready access to bank loans , stores could not be built quickly ; without large numbers of stores in a large number of markets , advertising was uneconomic ; without heavy advertising , competition with the ubiquitous Colonel Sanders was extremely difficult . " The wind was at our back in 1968 , " said John Jay Hooker recently , referring to the money situation . " In 1969 it turned around . " ' Substantial Loss ' No operational reports have been issued since 1968 , partly because of the accounting question . A preliminary report distributed in October said the company would show a " substantial loss , " for the first half of 1969 , owing to " tight money , unexpectedly severe competition and other factors , " To raise more money , the Hooker brothers last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corporation , a California conglomerate , and pledged to re-invest in franchises most of the $7.5-million they realized from the sale . Mr. Hooker , who has cut his ties with the business to get ready for the Governor 's camna ipn still 11 ( .11.17. s  --  in us. one of his favorite phrases  --  that " there are more chicken eaters than chicken stores . " Many Nashville businessmen who have retained some of their stock still think the company has potential . Of about 1,600 franchises sold , 263 stores are operating . About a dozen others have opened , then been forced to close because of unprofitability and stiff competition . Mr. Hooker remains confident . Lounging in a black armchair in the glass-domed sunroom of his sprawling house outside Nashville this week , he cited polls that show him well ahead of any other gubernatorial candidate , either Democratic or Republican . One of these , a survey of 450 registered voters taken this month by Oliver Quayle , showed Mr. Hooker running ahead of all other candidates by at least 2 to 1 in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident of Mr. Clement , who had planned to run against Mr. Hooker , has left something of a political vacuum . At the moment , the young businessman 's most serious rivals appear to be Mr. Carr , an amiable political veteran who began as a page in the State Senate in 1923 , and Dr. Nat T. Winston Jr. , a banjoplaying Republican who formerly served as state mental health commissioner . Mr. Quayle 's poll gave Mr. Hooker 53 per cent and Mr. Winston 22 , with 25 per cent ? an unusually high figure ? undecided . Testimony Is General Mr. Hooker 's testimony this week before the Senate Small Business Subcommittee , headed by Senator Harrison A. Williams Jr . of New Jersey , seemed to cause no political ripples here . He confined himself to a general discussion of the beginnings of the Minnie Pearl operation , and he was asked no particularly hostile questions . But an article in Barron 's magazine , which pictured the Hookers as little more than stock promoters , may prove damaging . And so may the S.E.C. investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock registration pending since May of last year , and although commission investigators have been working in Nashville for months , subpoenaing records of bank accounts and other transactions , the commission has given no indication of the purpose of its inquiry . For the moment , Mr. Hooke must proceed on the assumption that nothing will be forthcoming .
